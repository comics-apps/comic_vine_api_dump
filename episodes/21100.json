    "description": "<p>The Toyman Winslow Schott  gets fired from his job along with his secretary Margaret Duffy. Deciding to take revenge, he invents a new toy named \"Space Rats\" that includes a substance which when someone is sprayed with, it makes adults act like children and children be greedy. Everyone at the <i>Daily Planet</i> is affected, including Clark, and they start fighting over gifts. Clark realizes that the whole situation has to do with the \"Space Rats\" and along with Lois they try to find out who is the creator of the new toys. Their investigation leads them to Schott who gets arrested for his creation but also regrets and makes clear that he cares and loves kids. In the meantime, Superman asks from toy store owners to donor toys to the orphanage kids and Lois plans a Christmas dinner for family and friends. All of them though end up having other plans and Lois is alone at her apartment until Clark appears on her door, who canceled his Christmas with his family to be with her.</p>",

Their investigation leads them to Chinatown where they find out from Chen Chow , a friend of Clark's, that someone with the same martial arts knowledge has also robbed several times a specific company in Chinatown. The thief seems to act like a modern Robin Hood who steals from the rich and gives to the poor and is also using two bracelets with special power that allow them to use Superman's strength against him and even kill him. When the leader of the mafia finds out about the power of the bracelets, he wants them instead of his money, so he will kill Superman. Everyone believes that the thief is Chen Chow since his grandfather  teaches the martial arts the thief is using and is also the owner of the bracelets. As it is revealed though, the thief is Lin Chow the granddaughter and not Chen Chow. The mafia captures the grandfather, takes the bracelets and asks Lin to bring Superman to them otherwise they will kill her grandfather. Lin manages to teach Superman how to fight against Jzuk-Mao  who will be wearing the bracelets, so he will not get killed. Jzuk-Mao is defeated and leader of the mafia is arrested, Superman gets the bracelets and gives them back to grandfather Chow who gives them to Lin because she earned them.</p>",

But their plans are ruined when Dr. Gretchen Kelly brings Lex Luthor back to life. Lex is determined to get his fortune and Lois back and kill Superman and works with Gretchen and his old servant Nigel  to achieve it. When he learns that Rollie Vale (who is in prison following the events on the episode <i>Metallo</i>) has kryptonite in his possession, he visits him in prison and makes a deal with him; his freedom and money in exchange for the kryptonite. Lex manages to break Vale out and he also kidnaps Lois to force her come back to him. Back at Lex's hideout, Lex gives the kryptonite to Nigel to keep it safe, but Nigel betrays Lex by stealing it and shooting a bolt  at him before escaping.

Superman arrives to save Lois and when Lex realizes that he will be led to jail, he tries to kill himself like he did the last time. This time though, Superman stops him and he ends up behind the bars while Lois and Clark try to reschedule their first date.</p>",

Her first attempts are not much successful since Clark manages every time to appear in front of her as Superman, before she realizes who he really is. At the same time, Mr. X, a former member of Intergang, is about to testify against Intergang and one of its assassins. As it turns out, the assassin is Diana, who attempts to silence him before he does it. Superman gets into her way and she decides to kill him. She kisses Superman while wearing a kryptonite lipstick, something that makes Superman very sick since the kryptonite enters his body and spreads like a cancer. Before he is rushed to the hospital, Diana finds out that Clark Kent is Superman and makes a story about it on TV while Superman finds a way to \"kill\" the kryptonite that is inside him. Everyone is surprised when they hear the news about Superman's true identity and Clark organizes a press interview to prove that he is not Superman. With the help of his parents, they create an hologram of Superman that appears during the interview while Clark is also standing there, and Superman explains that Clark is his friend and he helps him by keeping his things at his house. After the press interview, Superman goes on to arrest Diana.</em></p>",

Gables uses the pill to fake the death of three criminals who are in prison and break them out of there as dead. Gables plan is to release a deadly virus (Virus A) in the city to revenge a mistake that happened while he was working on Star Labs and made him catch the specific virus. Superman manages to stop him before the virus is spread to the whole town and Gables, along with the three criminals who escaped prison, get arrested. Scardino asks Lois if it would be okay with her to ask her out some time while Clark is watching.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> The legendary author H. G. Wells arrives at the Daily Planet and wants to talk to Lois and Clark. When they hear he is from the future, they believe he is crazy and try to ignore him but Wells gets Clark's attention when he tells him that he knows he is Superman. Wells leads Lois and Clark to his time machine to meet Tempus only to discover that Tempus likes this new world instead of his ideal one, Utopia, and decides that he wants to travel back in time to when Superman first arrived on Earth, to kill him. Tempus and Wells travel back in time but Wells changes the date to 1866 instead of 1966 to earn some time while at the same time he leaves behind the instructions of how to build the time machine. Superman builds the time machine and Lois and Clark get to 1966 where they realize that Tempus and Wells traveled to 1866 and they head there too. In 1866, Tempus reveals the truth about Superman's true identity to Lois, before he travels with Wells to 1966, and Lois is furious with Clark for not telling her. Eventually, they all arrive in 1966 where Lois and Clark manage to stop Tempus killing an infant Superman and they make sure the Kents will find the baby. Wells takes Tempus in Dystopia and returns to take Lois and Clark back to present but a few moments before his first arrival so they will not remember anything, including Lois not remembering that Clark is Superman. Lois writes it down before they travel but Clark finds it and takes it away before Lois reads her own note.</em></p>",

Their investiagation leads them to discover about a project that started twenty years ago when a military doctor, Dr. Wilder, injected three infants with a virus that would allow him to control their mind when they would get older; one of the kids being Jimmy. The plan was to turn these kids into assassins but when he was discovered, he was discharged. Now, Dr. Wilder is dead but his wife, Claudette  and daughter, Dr. Katherine Wilder , try to complete his project. They manage to activate the virus in all three kids and while the first one dies, Jimmy and Sarah try to kill Lois and Clark while being under orders. Superman stops Jimmy before hurting Lois and Claudette and Katherine get arrested, while Jimmy and Sarah get to the hospital to remove the virus from their system. In the meantime, Lois tries to talk to Clark about her feelings but every time she does, Clark runs off because someone needs Superman. Lois, who cannot understand his behavior, is frustrated and ends up accepting Scardino's proposal to go out for a date.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> The leader of Intergang Bill Church is retired and his son, Bill Church Jr. takes over. Intergang wants to buy the Daily Planet but fails while at the same time they discover a new type of kryptonite that is red and not green. While trying to convince Perry to sell the newspaper, they try out the new kryptonite on Superman to see what effects has on him. The results show that when Superman is exposed to it, he becomes apathetic and does not care about anything. Intergang takes advantage of this to kidnap Perry while Superman wonders why he is acting that way. Lois sends him to Dr. Friskin , a psychotherapist, to help him out. Dr. Friskin believes that Superman needs vacations because of all the stress he puts on himself but during a session, the red kryptonite that Intergang put in her office is found by Superman and they realize that this is the reason for his behavior. Superman fights the effects the red kryptonite has on him and saves Perry while Church ends up in jail and Daily Planet reveals that he was the leader of Intergang. Lois and Clark take a second chance on dating with Clark promising he will not run off again.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p> Lois answers to Clark's proposal with the question \"Who's asking? Clark or Superman?\" and when Clark asks how long she has known, she says since the previous night. Lois is hurt and mad because Clark was lying to her all this time while Clark tries to explain why he could not tell her his secret. While Lois tries to come to terms with the revelation of Superman's identity, Bill Church  returns to Metropolis wanting to make it the safest city. Despite his good intentions, Lois and Clark do not trust this change of heart and try to prove that Church has not changed. Bill Church Jr.  along with Mindy Church's new wife, try to set up Church by putting a bomb at the museum's gala to send him back in prison. Lois manages to disarm the bomb with Clark's help while Bill Church and his son get arrested and Mindy takes over the company and re-launches Intergang.</p>",

In the following days, she seems to get into a trance situation and does things that put her life in danger, like jumping out of a helicopter. Superman saves her every time and when she investigates about it with Clark, they discover that every time it happens, someone steals scientific gadgets. They figure out that aliens did not abduct Lois but someone took her and injected her with a chip to make her do things and distract Superman, but they made it look like an alien abduction. Lois and Clark find who is responsible for this and bring him to justice while Clark realizes that being with Lois puts her in constant danger since Superman's enemies use her as a target.

Lois accepts his offer to make Clark jealous. In the meantime, rare antique items are being stolen from different museums and a deposit box.

Clark is proven right and Superman saves Lois the last minute and also destroys the mask with the emeralds that Patrick stole to give him the power to make the sacrifice.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p> Lois and Clark try to enjoy their first days together as an engaged couple when a woman named Leigh-Anne appears on National TV claiming to have had Superman's child, Jesse. Clark insists that she is lying, but Lois is uncertain what to believe when Jesse picks up a sofa and flies during the interview with Leigh-Anne. While Superman asks for a DNA test, Clark investigates and finds out the reason Jesse has superpowers; Superman saved a plane from crashing and a lightning bolt hit him, transferring part of his powers to Jesse who was a passenger on the plane. Leigh-Anne was scared that Superman would sue and take Jesse away from her, Clark told Leigh-Anne that Superman would not and understands why she did this; because she loves her son. In the meantime, a criminal known as Anonymous who is a master of disguise, kidnaps Jesse to use him in kidnapping the President. Anonymous wants the President  to give him the codes of a nuclear missile to launch it, something that he manages to do but Superman stops the missile in time and Anonymous is arrested. Leigh-Anne and Jesse say goodbye to Clark and Lois and want to thank Superman for saving Jesse. Leigh-Anne is enrolled in beauty parlor school and Jesse returns to Kindergarten.</p>",

Jaxon is obsessed with Lois and Lex Luthor and wants to extract some information from her to get into Luthor's computer brainwashing programme. Lois and Clark realize that they are trapped in the program when they notice that Clark does not have his superpowers. Clark manages to escape and he returns, as Superman, with the help of Jimmy to save Lois. In the process it is revealed that Jaxon is Luthor's illegitimate son and the three of them use that information against him to escape to reality. Jaxon's real purpose was to kill Superman, take over the world and make his father proud. The system though crashes and Jaxon's mind is trapped inside his virtual world forever.</em></p>",

In the meantime, Jimmy's father, Jack  returns to Metropolis after 4 years. As it is revealed, Jack is a spy who works for the NIA and is asked to get the burned computer the soonest as possible and to not stop in front of anything. Jack backs off when he learns that Jimmy is involved and has to kill him. When he learns what his boss was planning to do and why he wants the computer, he helps Superman prevent the catastrophe and then gets along with his son. Meanwhile, Clark and Lois were thinking about children and when Clark saw what Jimmy's father had to do - abandon his son - to save the world, he was afraid that this might happened with him and his kid as well. Lois tells him that this would not happen because he will be a good father and will put his family first.</p>",

While they are trying to make everything work, Lois asks Perry to give them a story so she can get her mind away for a while. Perry gives them a story about some frogs that have been stolen from a pet shop but as it is revealed soon, this is not just a frog robbery. Their investigation leads them to discover that a scientist named Mamba who used to work for Lex Luthor, replaced the President of the US  and one of his Secret Service agent with frog-eating clones that he has created. Lois and Clark solve the mystery and Mamba, along with the clones, get arrested while Lex escapes from prison after an official pardon that was written by the president clone. Lois and Clark get married but at the end of the episode it is revealed that the Lois who is with Clark is also a clone. It is not revealed if the real Lois was replaced before or after the wedding.</p>",

    "description": "<p> Starting from where the previous episode ended, Lois' clone pretends she is tired to avoid having sex with Clark, leaving him confused and disappointed. Clark realizes that Lois is acting weird but he does not know what is going on. At the same time, Lex Luthor  has the real Lois and plans to leave the town with her. He also tells her that Clark married the clone and till he notices, the two of them will be far away. The clone discovers that Clark is Superman and decides that she wants to be with Clark. To be able to do that, she has to kill the real Lois who escapes from Lex but she gets hit by a car and suffers from amnesia. She believes that she is Wanda Detroit, the main character of a book she was writing and gets a job at a bar as a singer. With the clone searching for her to kill her, Lex offers Clark his help to find Lois. When Lex hears where Lois is and that she believes she is Wanda, he pretends to be Kent (a man from the book that Wanda wants but believes she cannot have) and lies to her about who Clark is and what to tell him so the two of them can be together. When Clark finds her, Lois tells him that she never loved him and that she loves Lex and wants to be with him. Clark angrily promises Lex that he will do anything to bring Lois back. Lex and Lois then drive off leaving Clark alone with the clone.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> Lois is still with Lex Luthor believing that she is Wanda, the heroine from her unfinished novel, and Lex being Kent. Lex worries that Lois will soon recover her memory and plans to leave town with her as soon as possible. Lois' clone falls in love with Clark and after she apologizes for trying killing Lois, she helps him find her. Lex kidnaps the clone, angry at her betrayal and tells her that she only has two days to live. In hope that he will fix her, she tells him that Clark Kent is Superman, but Lex tells her that there is no way of increasing her life span. Lex then obtains a dangerous weapon called the A-Tech Quantum Disrupter that can kill his archenemy once and for all. He tries to convince Lois to kill Clark so her love for him will fade away completely. When all of them meet at the hideout of Lex, Lois cannot kill Superman and when Lex tries to do it, the clone tries to stop him which ends up killing them both. Clark manages to get Lois out of the hideout before it collapses while the dead bodies of the clone and Lex are both left behind. On their way out, Lois gets hit by a falling rock. It is revealed later at the hospital that despite the head trauma made her remember who she is, she does not recognize Clark at all.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p> Lois checks in a clinic for people with memory loss to help her gain her memories back. She remembers who she is but nothing around her work and what is her relationship with Clark. Her doctor, Dr. Deter falls in love with her and tells Clark that he should not tell Lois about them being a couple because it will shock her. In order to get them even more apart, Deter forbids Clark even visiting Lois while he comes closer to her. Meanwhile, another doctor in the clinic, Dr. Mendenhall, brainwashes the patients of the clinic to commit murders and then he kills them causing them a stroke. Clark investigates the murders and with the help of Lois, they manage to find out that Mendenhall is behind everything and stop him before Lois kills Perry as she was brainwashed to do. Mendenhall is arrested and the senior citizens are safe. Lois starts remembering things but not her relationship with Clark and she believes she is in love with Deter.</p>",

She still believes that she is in love with Dr. Deter  and when Deter sees signs that she starts remembering, he hypnotizes her into believing that she wants to go away with him. In the meantime, Lois and Clark have to investigate a strange phenomenon happening in Metropolis that makes people act weird. Their investigation leads them to Bad Brain's brother, Herkimer who is willing to do anything to make his mother love him and be proud of him. He created a machine that producers electromagnetic waves, affecting people's behavior. While getting saved by Superman at Bad Brain's Mother's house, the last shock of waves from the machine stirs up Lois' memories completely of her relationship to Clark, and the two of them get back together.</p>",

There, Lois learns that two (and later a third one) of her former classmates' spouses have disappeared and she decides to investigate those disappearances to find out what happened. While investigating, something strange starts happening to Clark; he is shrinking. Clark goes to Dr. Klein as Superman, who runs some tests to find out what caused this. The clues that Lois finds lead her to one of her former classmates, Annette Westman . Annette wants revenge on all those who mistreated her in school and enjoys seeing them suffer. She created a shampoo with a secret formula that causes people and things to shrink into miniatures so her friends would run to her for comfort. When Lois confronts her, Annette tries to shrink Lois too but, with the help of Superman, Lois gets away and Annette accidentally pours the entire formula onto herself, causing her to shrink into nothingness. Dr. Klein finds the antidote and everyone returns to their original size.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p> Lois and Clark discuss about their wedding and even buying a house together when someone appears and tests Superman's strength, intelligence and morals. Following the clues, Lois and Clark are led to a couple, Zara  and Ching who seem to know that Clark is Superman and they do not care to sacrifice people's lives to do more tests on Superman. When Superman passes the last test, Zara and Ching say that \"he is the one\" and they fly away to \"inform the others\" about it. Lois and Clark try to understand who Zara and Ching are and they think that they might not be from Earth since they could fly like Superman. It is revealed that Zara and Ching are from Krypton and they discuss about Superman saying that Clark has to leave Earth forever for their people's future and they have to find a way to tell him. While discussing, a male voice tells them that by finding Kal El, they signed his death sentence and the two of them seem scared.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Zara  and Ching  inform Clark that many of the Kryptonians had escaped Krypton before the planet blew up and they are all now settle on a new planet they call New Krypton. Zara is Kal El's wife and the reason she and Ching came to Earth was to find Kal El and take him back to New Krypton. The ruling families of New Krypton are in conflict and a Civil War is about to start. If Kal El will not go back, Zara will be forced to marry Lord Nor, an evil Kryptonian who would do anything to rule over the planet. Clark is conflicted if he has to leave Earth and he has to decide, along with Lois, what he should do. He finally decides that he should help his people, even if that means he might never see Lois again, and leaves Earth after making a public statement of why Superman must leave. In the meantime, Lord Nor sends his best assassin, Tez  who can transform in any form his wants, to kill Kal El before he leaves Earth but he fails and his life force is gone.</p>",

    "description": "<p> Lord Nor  accuses Kal El for treason and manages to prove that his marriage to Zara was never consummated and the two of them are not planning to fulfill this duty. The council trials Kal El finding him guilty and sentence him to banishment. During the execution of the sentence, Ching  finds a loophole in the system that Kal El can challenge Lord Nor to a duel and Trey  stops the procedure. While Clark and Lord Nor fight, Lois finds out that the kryptonite was stolen by the corrupt military colonel Cash and they are planning to kill all the Kryptonians. Cash does not care if Superman might get injured or die since he sees him as a bigger threat than Lord Nor, and they believe that by killing everyone is the only way to stop them. They use the kryptonite and manage to kill Lord Nor and his men but Superman survives. Colonel Cash ends up in jail. The Kryptonians leave Earth with Zara being the leader and married to Ching, while Clark stays on Earth with Lois.</p>",

Wells appears to inform them that they cannot do it since there is a curse on their love and if they do, Lois will die of a terminal disease after the consummation. The man who is behind the curse is the evil Tempus and the only way to lift the curse is for them to travel back in time, to their past lives when the curse was first applied. They first travel back in an era where Tempus is a Lord and Clark is Charlie, his best knight. Clark does not have his powers but he has a secret identity, the Fox, who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. Lois is Lady Lane, Lord Tempus' girlfriend but also Fox's secret lover. Lois and Clark try to break the curse and when they think they did, they get back to Metropolis only to realize that Tempus is a King and about to marry Lois. They travel back in time again with Clark's secret identity being Lone Rider this time. Tempus blackmails Lois to marry him otherwise he will kill her parents. Lone Rider manages to save her parents and Lois does not get married to Tempus. Lone Rider arrests Tempus and hands him over to the sheriff. Clark and Lois can now return to Metropolis.

Before he tells him what he wants, the man drops dead and despite looking over seventy, his identity says that he is in his twenties. Lois and Clark go to Dr. Klein  to find out what happened to the man while a prisoner named Conner Shenk  and Sandy Ward escapes from prison. Lois finds out that Superman's aging process differences from common people and is shaken when she hears that when she will be old, Clark will still be very young. In the meantime, Jimmy tries to investigate on his own and gets captured by a scientist named Vita Duetsen  who is revealed to be behind Shank's escape and the mystery with the young/old people. Lois and Clark discover her and Superman uses her machine to make Jimmy young again by giving him some of his life years so Jimmy will not die. Duetsen is arrested and Shank will return back to normal soon since he was transformed into a baby and head back to prison. Clark found a house with Lois to live in and told her that he gave up a few years of his life to save Jimmy.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Perry gets a promotion and leaves Lois at his place as the new editor of the Daily Planet. Lois is under pressure at her new position while Clark investigates a story that has to do with the disappearance of a black hat computer hacker, Eric Press. When strange things start to happen in Metropolis involving computers, Clark believes that Eric is involved but the lack of evidence leads Lois to kill his story. This leads to their first serious fight and causes troubles to their marriage. It is revealed that behind the hacking is indeed Eric but only because his brother Ethan forces him to do it since he wants to get revenge on Superman for killing his \"idol\", Lex Luthor. Both brothers are die hard Lex Luthor fans and want to get rid of Superman for this. Superman is out to encounter the two brothers while Lois puts the pieces together and realizes that Clark's story was important and that he is in danger. The two brothers block out the yellow sun to prevent Superman from recharging his powers and use a deadly weapon called the A-Tech Quantum Dispander (A new improved version of the weapon Lex used to kill Superman in <i>Seconds</i>) to kill him. Fortunately Superman gets his powers back and takes them into custody. Clark and Lois get back together and Perry, who is not really satisfied with his new position, asks Lois to run the paper together but Lois declines his offer telling him that she prefers to be a reporter as she has always been.</p>",

Lois and Clark try to solve the mystery while at the same time consider if they can have a kid together. Leslie  continues his plan of drifting Lois and Clark apart while at the same time trying, along with Mr. Smith, to rebuild Luthor's empire. He sends Lois to a convention and Clark to an exclusive interview while he follows Lois and hits on her causing misunderstandings between the couple. When the shadow attacks Lois, Superman manages to destroy him. Lois and Clark put the pieces together and find out who is behind everything and that his next target is Leslie. Leslie kills the man before Lois and Clark can talk to him claiming that he attacked him first. Lois and Clark put the pieces together, Lois saw the file that Lex Luthor owned some of the places. Lex showed her his diagram of all his holdings, Clark found out Leslie was the target by the shadow figure and Jimmy got a list of Leslie's holdings were all part of Lex's empire. Lois told Clark the shadow figure said, he will go after the son of the man who knew Superman's identity. Lois and Clark knew Lex knew Clark's identity and Leslie is Lex Luthor's son. Later on, Leslie and Mr. Smith hear a recording of Luthor  saying that Clark Kent is Superman.</p>",

    "description": "<p> It is Christmas Eve and Lois and Clark are getting ready for the first Christmas dinner at their home with family and friends but things get weird when an imp from the fifth dimension named  Mxyptlk  and wants to conquer the Earth making Superman leave. Mxyzptlk traps Metropolis in a time loop where everyone lives the same day over and over again and no one remembers it except Clark. Clark tries to figure out what is happening and Mxyzptlk tells him that every time people live the same day they lose a little of their hope and when the hope is lost completely, Superman will not be necessary to them. Clark tries to break this loop asking Lois' help for whom is hard to believe at first what Clark says. Clark manages to rekindle Lois' hope and frees her from the time loop and the two of them work together to free everyone else as well. They give everyone their hope back and trick Mxyzptlk into going back to his own dimension. With the imp gone, the loop is finally broken and everyone celebrates Christmas.</p>",

    "description": "<p> Perry's son, Jerry gets out of jail with good behavior and Perry tries to rebuild their relationship. Jerry has some red kryptonite that makes Superman unable to control his powers. Superman, not knowing what is going on, tries to find it out with Dr. Klein's  help while he stays away from Lois and everyone as much as he can so he will not hurt them. In the meantime, a mad inventor going by the name Mr. Gadget plans to blow up the buildings of Metropolis unless the government gives him $1 billion. Mr. Gadget finds out about Jerry's possession of red kryptonite and work with him for a high price, otherwise he will kill his father. Jerry hasn't changed at all and starts stealing and he is not a Superman fan. During their attempt to blow up the City Hall, Perry sees Jerry using the kryptonite and talks him out of it. Superman arrests Mr. Gadget and Jerry is also led back to jail for his involvement and the stuff he stole.</p>",

    "description": "<p> Randy Goode  is very jealous of Superman and wants to destroy his good image so he will be the next one to win the \"Man of the Year\" award (that Superman had apparently \"stolen\" from him the year before), and one of his photographers, Samantha manages to take pictures of Superman in bed with Lois. On her way to print the pictures, the film is destroyed so she is forced to create a \"fake\" photograph to give to the press. The \"fake\" photos go public leading to a huge scandal where Superman has an affair with a married woman and people start to lose their faith in him. Clark decides to tell the truth of Superman's real identity to prove that Lois never cheated on him knowing that it may lead to disastrous consequences. Lois does everything she can to find out who is behind this before Superman's press conference, and along with Jimmy's help, they manage to gather evidence that the photos are fake. Superman does not reveal his real identity and Goode and Samantha get arrested.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> Superman is trapped in the time travel window and Lois does not know what to do to bring him back while Tempus  keeps sending subliminal signals to people to keep supporting him. H.G. Wells  appears and tells Lois that to bring Superman back, they have to know the exact second he got into the window. They have 48 hours to do it, otherwise he will be lost forever. Wells also brings the alternate Superman from the parallel universe to help them till they find the real one. Superman and Lois work together and destroy the subliminal device of Tempus who gets arrested before he manages to release nuclear missiles against other countries. President Garner got his position back as President. Superman explains to everyone who Tempus really is and why everyone was supporting him so blindly. Meanwhile, Tempus' watch helps to find the exact second Clark got into the window since that moment, due to the explosion, his watch broke and stopped. Lois and Wells find their Clark and bring him back while the other Superman goes back to his universe and thanked the other Clark for looking out for everything while the other Clark was stuck in a time portal.</em></p>",

In the meantime, they try to investigate the disappearance of an astronaut, who, as is revealed later, was murdered. Meanwhile, a beautiful woman named Penny Barnes  thinks that Jimmy is Superman and starts a relationship with him. Penny's boss, Garret Grady  wants to activate a powerful satellite weapon system and is the one who is behind the murder of the astronaut since he refused to help him. When Grady finds out that Penny is Superman's girlfriend, he captures her, along with Lois, to force Superman help him with his plan. Jimmy helps so Lois and Penny get free while Superman destroys Grady's plan and Grady is arrested. Penny realizes that Jimmy is not Superman, but she still loved him, especially when he risked his life to save her. Later Perry, after numerous cancellations, decides to surprise both, Lois and Clark, for Clark's birthday party since it is the only way to actually have a party.</p>",

    "description": "<p> Lois and Clark find out that they cannot have a kid together and they are devastated. They decide to ask Lois' father, Sam for help but they know they will have to tell him that Clark is Superman. Sam is shocked by the news but he promises to see if he can help them while at the same time everyone is trying to keep the secret from Ellen. In the meantime, Dr. Klaus \"Fat Head\" Mensa is released from prison where he developed mind-control powers. He now wants revenge on his former colleagues for not helping him. He uses his telekinetic powers to kill one of them. Threatened by Mensa, Sam's current partner, Misha forces Sam to reveal Superman's identity. When Mensa is about to kill Misha, Misha reveals Superman's identity to Mensa. Mensa kidnaps Clark's and Lois' parents and threatens to kill them if Superman tries to stop him from stealing the bank gold. Misha is guarding the parents, but he decides to help them and does not follow Mensa's orders. Superman stops the bank robbery, but Mensa escapes. Mensa orders Misha to hook him up the \"Bummer-Be-Gone\" invention, believing it to increase his abilities, but it takes his telekinetic powers away while also erasing the knowledge that Clark is Superman away from Sam, Ellen and Misha. The episode — and series — ends with someone, unseen and unknown, who seems to know Clark's secret identity, leaving a baby in the bassinet in the living room with the Superman emblem as a blanket over the child and a note too, saying that the child belongs to them. After 6months of marriage, they finally have the child they've always wanted and both sets of grandparents are happy too.</p>",
