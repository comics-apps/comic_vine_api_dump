    "description": "<p> David Haller is being interrogated by government officials who believe he may be the most powerful mutant discovered. He explains that he was diagnosed as schizophrenic when he was young, and was taken to Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital after attempting to commit suicide. He spent six years as a patient there, during which time he met Sydney \"Syd\" Barrett, a girl who refused to be touched. She agreed to be his girlfriend, but was eventually discharged from the hospital. Before she left, Haller kissed her goodbye, causing their minds to switch bodies. Losing control, Syd unleashed abilities from Haller's body that killed his friend Lenny Busker and trapped the other patients in their rooms. Haller was evacuated in Syd's body. Later, Haller's body returned to him, and he went looking for Syd. Haller found himself being chased by two people until he was captured by the government. Now those two people, Ptonomy Wallace and Kerry Loudermilk, break into the government facility with Syd to rescue Haller and take him to Melanie Bird. </p>",

Meanwhile, gangster Leftover Louie has wagered $25,000 that he can convince his schoolmate Marge to bake him a fresh lemon meringue pie, even though she can't stand the sight of him. Inevitably, these two plot strands are intertwined, as a hopelessly confused Steve welcomes the vacuous Sylvester, a gun-toting Louie, and the honest-to-goodness Superman into his tiny snowbound shack.</em> <b></b></p>",

Naturally, not all of the participants play fair, and the result of this skullduggery could prove fatal to all concerned. Fortunately, Superman  is on hand to make sure that justice is served and the spirit of fair play is upheld, but this time he has to keep his presence a secret.</p>",

    "description": "<p> <em>Two men have arrived at the Metropolis airport. One is scientist Professor Van Wick, who has brought some rock samples with him from Africa, and the other is Gary Allen, an old acquaintance of Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent. Allen has recovered from being in an airplane crash in Africa some time back. He's felt better than he has in years until a sudden bout of weakness hits him while telephoning Clark at the baggage claim desk. Both Clark and Jimmy Olsen, who was sent to meet Gary, are surprised to see him feel better away from the luggage. However, Allen feels dizzy and ill once he returns there. Unseen by Jimmy and Gary, Clark is stunned to feel the same symptoms as his friend. This can only mean one thing. There is kryptonite, the only substance that can harm Superman, in the area. How did it get in the Metropolis airport, and how can Gary Allen feel the effects of its deadly radiation?</em> <b></b></p>",

No one was seen taking the merchandise from various shops and establishments in the city. Editor Perry White is screaming for this mysterious case to be solved. The closest thing to a lead comes to Clark Kent in the form of a homing pigeon. A note is in the box in which the bird was delivered. It is signed by the Spectre, the mastermind behind this crime wave. If Kent wants to learn more about the recent thefts, he's to send a reply with the feathered messenger. No police are to be involved. However, nothing is said about Superman. Clark Kent may need his costumed alter ego if he is to make any progress in this investigation.</p>",

    "description": "<p> While there's still crime on the streets of Metropolis, it's been a slow news week for the Daily Planet. Editor Perry White has ordered Lois Lane, Clark Kent and Jimmy Olsen to go out and search for a story that will sell newspapers. As Kent patrols the city as Superman, Jimmy has found a scoop for the chief. A man is doing a cat's cradle with some string as he crosses the street. He runs into a thief who makes a hasty exit from Federated Savings and Loan. The man stumbles into the gangster, unwittingly capturing him with the twine and his arms. Jimmy takes a photograph of the incident for the Planet. Little does the cub reporter realize that an innocent bystander is about to take part in the greatest adventure of his life. <b></b></p>",

The pharmaceutical company that sent them on the delivery route believe that their driver Mister Harris may wish to sell them illegally. Even Superman has had no luck in finding the missing goods. Meanwhile, the Daily Planet is shorthanded as cub reporter Jimmy Olsen is taking some time off for a week. As the young man is driving, Police Officer Fanning pulls him over. Jimmy was only driving thirty-five miles per hour in a forty-five mile zone. However, according to Fanning, Jimmy drove through the small town of Akport, a hamlet of four little wooden buildings that Jimmy didn't even see. As Fanning and Olsen arrive in the tiny village, Judge Frank Plummer is fining another \"speeder\" seventy-five dollars plus another five for insulting the judge. Jimmy is clearly in the middle of an unusual adventure that is certain to cut his vacation short.</em> <b></b></p>",

Kent is investigating things as Superman when the chief receives an urgent telephone call. The Planet warehouse on 1800 Waterfront Way is on fire. Leaving a note for Clark to take over in his absence, Perry goes with Lois and Jimmy to the location of the blaze. There, Mister White realizes that twelve thousand dollars of the newspaper's payroll money is in the building's safe. Meanwhile, the trio has spotted a lunch wagon with the words \"Fireman's Friend\" written on the side. The two men running it, Slim and his wisecracking partner Torch, have been giving free coffee and donuts to the firemen to disguise their true intentions. In reality, Torch has entered the inferno after exchanging his tray of food and drink for another one. He is wearing a suit made of fireproof plastic designed by Slim. The pair's motives for their plans are unclear, and only one thing is certain, there's a new unusual mystery that only Superman and his friends can solve. If they don't, a new reign of terror could run rampant in Metropolis.</em> <b></b></p>",

    "description": "<p><em> Tony Gambini opened his barber shop in Metropolis last week. As Daily Planet cub reporter Jimmy Olsen is about to sit in Tony's chair for a haircut, notorious gangster Rick Sable cuts in front of him for a shave. Tony realizes that he and Rick grew up together as Jimmy listens and waits. He gets a tip that Sable intends to rob the Acme Jewelry Company at noon. Running to a nearby diner, Jimmy calls Clark Kent in hopes of getting Superman on the case. Kent thinks nothing of what Jimmy heard, but he promises that Superman will be on the alert. Jimmy then returns to Tony's to witness a strange incident. Rick Sable, after being persuaded by Gambini, is calling the police to confess to the crime he is about to commit. However, thinking it's all a practical joke, Tony stops him before he can continue. Jimmy later recounts the odd event to Clark. He finds it unusual and cannot help but wonder what brought one of Metropolis' biggest mobsters to do such a thing. There is also the matter of the heist. Will Rick Sable and his henchmen pull off the job, or has Tony Gambini convinced his childhood friend to do the right thing?</em> <b></b></p>",

Unfortunately, the authorities are unable to catch him as he is driving more than one hundred and twenty miles per hour out on Highway 201. This is truly a job for Superman, who has received a call about the incident from Inspector Bill Henderson as Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent. Acting as an impervious road block, the Man of Steel halts Garfield's getaway car, allowing the police to take him into custody. Another crime has been halted by Superman. Little does the caped hero realize that his encounters with the Crowley Mob are only just beginning.</em> <b></b></p>",

Young Bobby Jackson has gotten permission from his great-grandfather to donate items. Bobby has bundled some things together, and two men named Cueball and Mike pick them up. While Mike and Cueball do drop the material off at the various relief organizations, they are using this tragedy to cover the fact that they also steal from the charitable people. In the meantime, Bobby is overjoyed that he was able to do a good deed. Grandpa Jackson is not so happy, for Bobby has given away his Prince Albert coat, which had the old man's life savings of ten thousand dollars in cash hidden in the lining. The funds were for Bobby's education. Mister Jackson placed them in the clothing because he never trusted banks. If Cueball and Mike find the currency, it could be used to finance something evil.</em> <b></b></p>",

    "description": "<p>Jimmy Olsen's latest hobby is chemistry. This could prove dangerous for the cub reporter when he accidentally burns Frank Gannis' sixty dollar pair of pants with a concoction that sprayed out the opened window. Fortunately, Superman arrives before Gannis can harm Olsen. Jimmy, blaming himself for the incident, tells Superman to let Gannis go. However, a rubber ball the lad created proves to be more lethal than any disgruntled pedestrian. It explodes after bouncing, but the Man of Steel's invulnerable body takes the brunt of the impact. At this point, Superman tries to persuade his pal to take a safer pastime like collecting butterflies. Jimmy might do well to listen to our hero, for his meddling with science could get him into deep trouble. Especially after he invents an anti-gravity fluid by mistake. <b></b></p>",

    "description": "<p> <em>Our story takes us to South America, where Daily Planet editor Perry White and reporters Lois Lane and Clark Kent are speaking with President Patillo about placing a Latin American edition of the newspaper in the country. In the meantime, Vice-President Obreon is conspiring with cabinet member Philippe Gonzalez. A briefcase containing a bomb has been placed in Patillo's office. It is to go off at noon. Once the device eliminates the president, Obreon can take his place and rule with an iron fist. Patillo has been doing everything he can to help his people, and this does not sit well with his second-in-command. Obreon, however, did not count on Superman's preventing the vile act of terrorism. Clark, having forced Perry and Lois out of the office, heard the ticking before changing into the costumed hero. The Man of Steel's impervious body took the brunt of the explosion, thereby saving Patillo. Unfortunately, to cover his tracks, Obreon uses the law to assist him. Anyone who is seen at the scene of an assassination attempt must be placed in prison. This includes Superman. President Patillo protests until Obreon points out that if he beaks the law, he will be replaced. Superman has no choice but to turn himself in to the authorities. With the Last Son of Krypton in jail, there may be no way to stop Vice-President Obreon from succeeding in his vile schemes to take over the land. .</em></p>",

His brother Steve can declare him legally dead at noon tomorrow. This will prevent the police from arresting him for the deeds in which he is charged. It is believed that Barton has been hiding out in a cube made of an unusual metal created by a scientist who has died. Nothing, even an acetylene torch, has been able to cut through it. Metropolis Police Inspector Bill Henderson is running out of ideas on how to discover if Paul is within the structure. The only thing that has not been tried yet is Superman.

    "description": "<p> <em>Having struck it rich in his thirty years as a prospector, Harrison Pebble wishes to give to those in need. Both the Daily Planet and Superman are actively involved in the Children's Camp Fund, and Pebble has some land that would be perfect for the charity's use. Money for the site will come from a silver mine that Pebble has named Superman Silver Mine in honor of the Man of Steel. This news could most certainly make the youngsters of Metropolis very happy. Gangster Dan Dobey and his henchman Boris have been in a slump lately. However, Lois Lane's article on Harrison Pebble and the Superman Silver Mine in the Planet give them an idea. Dobey is a dead ringer for Pebble. The only differences are Dobey has no mustache, and he has a metal plate in his head from an injury to his skull in an automobile accident. Dan Dobey could pass himself off as Pebble without any problems. Should he be able to do so, the Superman Silver Mine and its wealth could fall into the criminal's greedy hands. Dan Dobey may get more than he bargained for if Superman discovers his evil plot.</em> <b></b></p>",

    "description": "<p><em> Daily Planet editor Perry White is fit to be tied with reporters Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. It seems to the chief that they always need Superman's help when they try to get an exclusive for the newspaper. White has now challenged Jimmy and Lois to get their next scoop without the aid of the Man of Steel. Should they do this, they will get the ten dollar raise promised them two years ago. The only condition to the challenge is that Perry is to go with Lois and Jimmy to see the story as it progresses. However, Mister White must promise to let Olsen and Lane run things for the article. Perry, Lois and Jimmy may get more than they bargained for if Superman is unable to help them. Especially when an eccentric scientist creates an anti-memory vapor, which is used to stage a robbery. <b></b></em></p>",

If he doesn't stop his investigations of the gangster's munitions operations, an experimental bomb created by Duke's scientist Harold will hit the Planet Building.

It could even blow up during construction of the weapon. Meanwhile, Mrs. Taylor, who owns and runs a boarding house on 64 Hope Street in Metropolis, has seen an iron monster prowling around next door.

    "description": "<p><em> Duke Barlow has been apprehended by Superman. He and Whitey Krell were caught robbing the Fifth National Bank. Both men are part of a gang responsible for a major crime wave in Metropolis. The leader of the organization is unknown to everyone, even those pulling the jobs. According to Barlow, who is attached to a lie detector, the leader planning everything is only called Mister X. Even Police Inspector Bill Henderson's best officer Sergeant Helen J. O'Hara is baffled by this case. She's even been trying to get into Mister X's syndicate somehow. This impresses Superman. After Inspector Henderson introduces her to him, the Man of Steel and O'Hara discuss her investigation. Our hero then does something that takes everyone by surprise. He asks O'Hara to marry him. The lovely sergeant accepts his proposal. This could prove to be dangerous for O'Hara should Mister X get wind of her nuptials to Superman.</em> <b></b></p>",

The lad has a rather unique pet - a burro named Carmelita who Pepe claims can read minds. The animal's power is tested when Clark is asked to think of how many times he's been in Mexico this year. Carmelita taps the floor thrice with her hoof. Lois thinks that she is mistaken because Clark only went once south of the border. However, Superman has been there for rescue efforts. To save his secret identity, Clark says that he traveled in two other moments about which Lois didn't know. In the meantime, Carmelita even guesses Jimmy's age correctly. The burro may very well be telepathic. This could lead to her and Pepe being involved in the most intense adventure of their lives with Superman.</em> <b></b></p>",

    "description": "<p><em> Daily Planet editor Perry White's secretary Ethel has just called the chief. A most unusual person wants to see him. White, exasperated with all the mystery and cub reporter Jimmy Olsen's bumbling, allows the insistent visitor to enter his office. He, Lois Lane and Jimmy are surprised by what they see. The man is wearing a mask made of lead. He is discussing his intentions as Clark Kent enters the room. Since the Planet and Superman were responsible for his incarceration, he and his ten other similarly disguised men will exact their revenge on the Man of Steel by trapping his friends in differently creative ways. His mask is locked on, and only the ringleader has a key. With no way for Superman to identify his enemy, the caped hero will have to discover other means to stop him before Perry, Lois and Jimmy find themselves in grave peril.</em> <b></b></p>",

    "description": "<p> <em>Professor J.J. Pepperwinkle is at it again. This time he's created a machine that can transform any metal into gold. United States Secretary of the Treasury John Salem and International World Bank President Delbert Carter have done various tests to prove it's the genuine article. They are in Daily Planet editor Perry White's office discussing the matter with him, Pepperwinkle and reporters Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Clark Kent. Carter and Salem know that the professor's invention could topple the world's economy, trade and commerce. The two men ask Pepperwinkle to never make more gold. He promises to not use his new device ever again. Clark, Lois and Jimmy are also sworn to secrecy on the entire matter. However, J. Blabbermouth Olsen, as Perry has nicknamed him, has unwittingly spilled the beans. As he, Lois and Professor Pepperwinkle have lunch, Jimmy talks about the gold making apparatus. Gangsters Nick Mitchell and Elbows Logan are sitting in the diner booth behind them, and they have heard the entire conversation. Now, the criminals intend to force Professor Pepperwinkle to make gold for them. Should he refuse, he could pay the ultimate price with his life.</em> <b></b></p>",

    "description": "<p><em> A heat wave in the winter causes the citizens of Metropolis to blame Superman's powers for their troubles after some scientists theorize that his drawing on the sun's powers is what caused it. Superman promises at first to stop using his powers till things get cleaned up but when some people's lives are in danger, he breaks his promise and he gets arrested. He later promises to leave town as all things seem to suggest that he is indeed the cause of the heat wave leaving Lois behind to discover the truth about what is going on. Lois manages to discover that a factory of Lex Luthor is behind the heat wave since it is emitting a lot of heat and asks Superman to return to town to help them stop it.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p> Lex Luthor cuts the funding of Miranda's  research, a chemist who is in love with him and they were ex-lovers. To prove to Lex that he was wrong and her research is valid, she uses her new perfume formula and sprays the staff of the <i>Daily Planet</i> that includes a chemical that removes all the sexual inhibition . Everyone in the <i>Daily Planet</i> start acting weird and crazy in love but Clark is not affected by the chemical. With Lois hitting on him, Clark tries to find out what caused this madness. When the effect of the chemical wears off, Lois and Clark discover that the perfume Miranda sprayed them with contains specific pheromones which lead them to act the way they did. In the meantime, Miranda plans to spray the whole town with an advanced formula of the perfume that will cause permanent damage to people. Lex who believes Miranda will carry out her threat, asks Superman's help to stop her before it is too late. Superman manages to stop Miranda in time.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> Lois decides to take a weekend off from work and books the honeymoon suite at a luxurious hotel to relax. While staying there, she witnesses Congressman  Ian Harrington possibly making a dirty deal across the street about a top secret government project named \"Shock Wave\" with arms dealer Thaddeus Roarke. She takes some photos of the men exchanging money and when she returns to Daily Planet she asks Perry to let her go back to investigate the subject. Perry agrees but decides to send both, Lois and Clark, undercover as a newly wed couple to stay at the suite and spy on the two men. Lois and Clark experience how it is like to live with someone else while at the same time they discover that Roarke plans to sabotage a weapon test of the navy endangering the lives of millions of people. Superman manages to stop the disaster and saves Metropolis. Roarke is arrested and Congressman Harrington set up a sting operation to put him behind bars.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p> A kid named Nick (Jarrett Lennon) gets kidnapped and when his mother Rose reaches to Lois and Clark for help, the two of them start to investigate all the recent kidnappings of children. The way Nick was kidnapped - through a magic box decorated with moons and stars - leads them to a magic club where they meet the magician  Andre Novak. While they are trying to find clues to connect Novak to the kidnappings, Superman confronts the kidnapper himself during the exchange of money for Nick, but the kidnapper hypnotizes him into thinking that \"wrong is right\" and Superman starts doing weird things everytime he hears the phrase \"moon and stars\". Eventually, Lois finds Nick and when Superman arrives for help, they discover that behind the kidnappings is Constance, the assistance of Darrin Romick another magician who works with Novak. Constance not only is responsible for the kidnappings and for hypnotizing Superman, but she also hypnotized Romick into killing Novak. Superman manages to fight the hypnosis, saves everyone and Constance gets arrested.</p>",

Eugene escapes and hides at Lois' apartment while Lois tries to prove his innocence. Lois and Clark's investigation leads them to discover that Lean is acting strange for someone who grieves her husband and lover's conviction while at the same time, a virus called \"The Ides of Metropolis\" that Henry was working on, takes over all the computers of the country. Eugene is the only one who can find the antidote to it and with the help of Superman, they manage to stop the virus before it is too late. While Superman and Eugene work for the antidote, Lois and Detective Reed find out that Henry is not dead and along with Lena are behind the virus. When everything is done, Reed arrests Henry and Lena. In the meantime, Jonathan arrives at Clark's house after fighting with Martha because he believes that Martha is having an affair.</p>",

    "description": "<p> Clark discovers that the globe he had found on his spaceship (<i>Strange Visitor (From Another Planet)</i>) is a projector of messages from his biological father Jor-el   who tries to explain him, in five different messages, why he and his mother, Lara (Eliza Roberts), had to send him to Earth and find out the truth about Clark's heritage and his birth name is Kal-El. Clark only manages to see the first message before a teenage thief named Jack found Clark's stuff in a garbage dump and then sells it to two strangers who are not others than Lex Luthor and his assistant and told him the globe has something do with Superman. Clark tries to find and take the globe back and manages to locate Jack with the help of a Lois' friend named Louie. While trying to find out who bought the globe, Lois is upset with him because he lied to her about Superman's globe. At the end, Superman finds the globe but he is not able to find out who bought it, Clark found out he wasn't abandoned by Jor-El and Lara that they're planet Krypton was being destroyed and it was too late save everyone in Krypton and themselves but one person they can save is Clark and he was saved by them when Kyrpton was destroyed, Clark helps Jack to get a job at <i>Daily Planet</i> and into a foster home and got Jack's brother Denny into a good foster home and Lois forgives Clark for lying to her since if she had found the globe she would do exactly what Clark did; hide it and not tell anyone about it.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> Superman saves a crippled jet in Paris while Clark is at Daily Planet and watches the event on TV in shock. He has no idea who that new Superman is and tries to find him and talk to him but it is not easy. Clark wonders if he has a twin brother but in reality the new Superman is a  clone that Lex Luthor created to kill Superman. Lois comes closer to the clone but being so close makes her realize that this guy is not the Superman she knows since he is acting weird. Clark manages to talk to the clone and the only thing he can learn is that the clone believes that they are enemies and his \"father\" told him to stay away from him. When Superman starts asking questions about the clone's childhood, it makes the clone start wondering if his \"father\" has been lying to him. The clone asks Luthor about it but he is not getting any answers, only that he has to kill Superman the soonest as possible. The clone overhears that he is dying and that is why Luthor wants him to kill Superman sooner than they thought. The clone and Superman confront each other but the last moment, the clone confesses the truth to Superman without telling him though who created him. Before he dies, the clone gets the lock of hair that Luthor used to clone the real Superman and takes it to Superman to destroy it so no one can clone him again.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em> Lex proposes to Lois who is surprised and asks him some time to answer. Lex, to force Lois accept his proposal, buys the Daily Planet to \"save\" it from closing but things do not get better. When Lex hires a young man named Chip to be Perry's boss, Perry leaves the newspaper. Later on, a planted bomb by Lex that seems to be detonated by Jack, destroys the newspaper completely and Jack ends ups in jail as a scapegoat who was framed by Lex and Mrs Cox. Lex claims that is impossible to rebuild the newspaper and offers Lois a job on television which she accepts. Perry decides to retire while Clark and Jimmy have no jobs. In the meantime, Lois tells Clark about Lex's proposal, something that makes him furious especially since Lois is thinking about it and did not say no to him. Clark, in an attempt to stop Lois from marrying Lex, confesses his love to her and tries to make her see that Lex is not who he seems to be. Lois tells him that she loves him too but as a friend and later on confesses her love to Superman. When Superman makes it clear that the two of them will never be together, Lois accepts Lex's proposal.</em></p>",

All their clues lead them to Lex but they do not have any proof about it yet and they try to find everything they need to legally accuse him. But they found enough evidence to put Lex behind bars and Jack is cleared of charges. In the meantime, Lex finds the last piece of kryptonite and manages to trap Superman in a cage while his wedding with Lois is about to start. Lois decides in the last minute that she can not marry Lex while Perry arrives with the police to stop the wedding and Lex to be arrested and so is Mrs Cox who is already arrested. Lex runs away but having no way to escape, he prefers to jump off of the highest building of Metropolis than going to jail, committing suicide. Superman, who managed to escape the kryptonited cage, tries to fly to save Lex but his powers are not back and he can not do it. Franklin Stern decides to rethink Perry's proposal to buy Daily Planet and rebuild it putting everything back in track. At the end of the episode, Lois is determined to confess her love to Clark but Clark talks first telling her that he was lying when he told her that he loves her more than just a friend and he only did it to stop her from marrying Lex.</em></p>",

With the help of Dr. Heller a plastic surgeon who worked for Lex and she later kills, she creates a duplicate of Lois. Dr Carlin used her books to get the public to hate Superman and turn against him and make Lex Luthor like a hero. The duplicate does things that Lois would never do, like accusing Superman for killing Lex or throwing a tear gas in the newsroom of Daily Planet, to make everyone believe that Lois got crazy. At the same time, Arianna gets hired by Perry on the Daily Planet as a therapist and pushes everyone to believe even more that Lois is not herself and she needs help. Clark decides to help Lois investigate the truth even though he is not sure if he has to believe her when she says that she is fine. Eventually, they discover the true identity of Arianna as Lex's ex-wife and they reveal the truth but not before Arianna captures Lois and attempts to kill Superman using kryptonite making it look like Lois did it. Lois manages to help Superman and he makes sure that Arianna and the duplicate gets arrested. Dr. Gretchen Kelly who is taking care of Lex's body that was stolen at the end of season one after his death, tells him that Arianna failed but he will always have her.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>The nominations for the Kerth Awards are about to be announced and Lois is sure that she will be nominated again since she has been every time for the last three years and won. When Clark gets nominated instead of her, she gets jealous and insecure, something that affects their investigation about a new villain in town who uses sound waves as a weapon. The sound wave puts people to sleep while he is able to rob banks and jewelry stores. Lois and Clark disagree on who the suspect might be, since Lois believes it is Lenny Stoke while Clark believes it is Dr. Derek Camden. The truth is somewhere in between since Stoke used Camden's knowledge to create the device for the sound waves, a device that can also produce a sound that affects Superman, something that makes it difficult for Superman to stop him. Eventually, Superman stops Stoke and sends him in prison, while Clark wins the Kerth Award. Lois is proud of her partner but she also warns him that the next time he forces her to be his date on a night where he gets awarded she will tear him apart, making both of them laugh.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> After an accident on a fair wheel, a worker of a corporation named Stuart Hofferman comes to Lois saying that this was not an accident since he himself had informed about the problem on the wheel but they ignored him. Lois writes the story and does everything she can to protect her source, even after Eric Thorp (Tim Grimm), the man behind the accident, tries to kill her and forces Stuart to say that he was lying. Perry is forced to kill the story while Stuart, who has been hiding at Clark's place, disappears. The disappearance looks like Stuart has been murdered and Lois gets suspended since the murder was a result of Stuart providing her information. Clark helps Lois to restore her reputation and they discover that Stuart is not dead but he staged his death along with his best friend Oliver (Jeff Joseph), so people would leave him alone. They find him and convince him to help them expose the truth. Thorp is arrested and Lois returns to the Daily Planet having restored her reputation.</em></p>",

Griffin, who is also known as the Prankster, is now out of jail and is seeking for revenge. Using those pranks, he can terrify Lois while at the same time, he uses them as a distraction to steal a diamond and rob banks. Lois and Clark manage to finally spot him and with the help of Superman, they arrest him sending him back to prison.</em></p>",

Clark witness what happens while Superman arrests the man. Lois and Clark start investigating the case and they discover that a new criminal organization called intergang  , buys property in South Metropolis at very low prices. Superman tries to help but after an encounter with Martin Snell, the lawyer of Intergang, he is unable to do anything because of their threats against everyone he loves. He still finds a way to help when Lois gives him the idea to be in South Metropolis undercover, so Intergang will not know that Superman is there. In the meantime Mayson Drake the prosecuting attorney assigned to the case, shows interest in Clark but she hates Superman. This interest makes Lois jealous of her and tries to keep Clark away from her, especially when Lois discovers that Mayson's ex boss is Bill Church a man who she believes is the leader of Intergang but she has no proof. Eventually, Lois and Clark work with Mayson and they manage to get Snell arrested but the moment he is ready to reveal who is the leader of Intergang, Church blows up the room killing him.</p>",

Lois and Clark investigate the \"accident\" and they discover that an old college friend of Lois named Ryan Wiley who supposedly died a year ago, was present at the demonstration. Lois visit Molly her best friend from college and ex-girlfriend of Ryan, to ask her about him. Molly is very different as a person now and she is against everything that has to do with technology. When she is asked about Ryan, she insists that all she knows is that he is dead. In the meantime, a citywide blackout forces the <i>Daily Planet</i> to find a means to publish the paper without the help of modern technology. Lois and Clark discover that Ryan's plan is to high-jack a satellite and blow up an army base. They get to the base where Lois finds Molly tied up in a chair realizing that she was also fooled by Ryan. The two women try to stop the program via the computer but it is impossible to do it. With Superman's help, they stop the satellite and Ryan, along with Colonel Fane  who was part of the plan, get arrested while trying to escape.</p>",

    "description": "<p> Perry and Jimmy get car-jacked by  Bonnie and Clyde and they all believe that the people who did it were just impersonating the two robbers. When John Dillinger (Robert Clohessy) and Al Capone (William Devane) also appear in Metropolis, things get even more weird and Lois and Clark discover that a scientist named Professor Emil Hamilton (John Pleshette) cloned the criminals because he believed he could alter people's personalities. Hamilton is not able to control the criminals anymore, who try to take over Metropolis, and Capone also forces him to recreate his old gang. Lois and Clark go to a club to find out more about the criminals and during a confrontation there, Clyde shoots Clark who has to fake his death so his Superman identity will not revealed. While everyone mourns the loss of Clark, Clark does not know what to do until he reads Hamilton's research and uses it as an excuse to explain how he is alive again. The criminals attack <i>Daily Planet</i> but Superman gets there in time and stops them while the police arrests them. Clark's return makes everyone happy especially Lois who on their way home she decides to express Clark her real feelings about him only to realize that while she was talking Clark fell asleep and did not hear anything of what she had said.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> Lois gets an info about Lex being alive and kept in a cemetery and wants to check it with Clark. At the cemetery, a man named William Wallace Webster Waldecker  tries to commit suicide and Superman stops him. The moment though he catches his hand, a lightning strikes him and his powers are copied to Wallace. Dr. Gretchen Kelly  who keeps Lex's body, witnesses the power exchange and wants to get Superman's powers for herself. Wallace starts calling himself \"The Resplendant Man\" and starts saving people but he charges them for it. Superman tries to talk to him and explain that charging is not how a super hero works but Wallace refuses to listen, while at the same time tries to hide from Lois how Wallace got his powers because then everyone will want to get those powers. In the meantime, Gretchen kidnaps Wallace's sister (and Lois for following and finding where she is hiding) to force Wallace into helping her get Superman's powers. Superman arrives and even though Kelly gets his powers from Wallace, Superman manages to use the stimulation and return the powers from both, Wallace and Gretchen, to him. Lois writes the story but skips the part of how the powers of Superman were copied while Gretchen dressed as a coroner, manages to get Lex's body back from the police when everyone believes he is dead.</em></p>",
