    "description": "<p><em> While Professor Peterson is testing his new duplicating ray, Superboy arrives to see his progress. Lightning causes a power surge, which in turn causes the ray to hit Superboy. The result of the ray is Bizarro, an imperfect duplicate of Superboy who possesses all of his powers, but a very limited intelligence. Bizarro wreaks havoc at a shopping mall and eventually takes Clark's place at the Shuster costume party under the name Kent Clark. Meanwhile, Superboy determines that he must destroy Bizarro with kryptonite. Even worse, Professor Peterson tells Superboy his first duplication experiment became unstable and exploded, and the same thing will happen to Bizarro. After Bizarro causes a disruption at the costume party and stops Lana on the road, Superboy uses the kryptonite on him only to discover it has no effect. Bizarro throws the rock back at Superboy and flies away with Lana in his arms. Superboy lies on the street, writhing in pain.</em></p>",

When the police stage a raid on the store since Lana was kidnapped, Bizarro mistakes them for muggers trying to harm his woman. Meanwhile, Superboy is saved from the kryptonite by Andy, and he and the professor determine that Bizarro will only be affected by Bizarro kryptonite. Upon learning of Bizarro's whereabouts, Superboy goes to confront him while Prof. Peterson works on duplicating the kryptonite. Superboy and Bizarro battle in a carnival area and eventually Bizarro begins to smoke. He is unstable, and will likely explode if he is not stopped by the Bizarro kryptonite soon.

    "description": "<p><em> A construction worker brings an unusual glowing rock to the Bureau and when Superboy appears to investigate, an alien creature leaps from the rock and attaches itself to the Boy of Steel. Courtesy of the creature, Superboy experiences a series of nightmares: one in which his secret identity is revealed, one in which he discovers he is a robot, and one in which Clark and Superboy fight for Lana's love. Meanwhile, the creature feeds off the adrenaline the dreams are causing Superboy to generate and if the Bureau staff can't remove the creature, Superboy will die. WCW wrestler Lex Luger cameos as an evil version of Superboy via hallucination.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em> After Superboy's near death run-in with Luthor, he is taken to yet another universe, one of which an alternate Dr. Winger, Luthor, (who is now a doctor), and Superman (a future version of Superboy) exist. Dr. Winger admits that he's responsible for Superboy's latest (and dangerous) adventure. The alternate version of Luthor works to save Superboy who has lost a lot of blood and needs a transfusion to live. Dr. Luthor asks Superman, who is now retired and an old friend, father figure and mentor to him to help. Superman agrees and donates blood. Later, Superman visits Superboy as he recovers and shows him the utopian world that he helped create. Additionally, Superman explains that the reason for the age difference between himself, Superboy and the child found in the alternate universe is that the escape rockets that left Krypton all passed through a timewarp; resulting in different versions of Superman landing at different times in history. Superman also lets slip a few interesting facts about things regarding Superboy's origins and history that Superboy has not discovered yet and to spite being pressed by Superboy for details; Superman won't say anymore. Later, as they tour the city; Superboy expresses his concerns that he won't be able to do the same things in his universe. Superman assures him that he can do it while Superboy confronts the older Superman about feeling bored with life and needing to feel useful. Superboy asks if Superman is happy with his life, given the sacrifices he must have made to help the world. Superman answers that he was proud to be able to help people, but regrets never having children and family. Superboy returns to the other universe and faces Luthor in a brief battle and is slightly injured. In the end, Luthor is taken away and the older Superman arrives to send Superboy back to his universe and take the younger alternate version of himself into his care to be properly nurtured and taught to help others as well as giving the older Superman a new purpose. (Ron Ely guest stars as Superman.)</em></p>",

And he has a plan to get Superboy out of the way as well. Superboy is drawn to an old lair of Luthor's by a hypersonic signal. There he finds Lana has followed him and they discover a computer program, created by Luthor, known as a \"psycho-disc\". The program allows the user to live out Luthor's life in a virtual reality type environment. Superboy activates the program and becomes Luthor in the VR world. He sees how Luthor lived with an abusive father, and a mother who refused to stand up for herself. The only person Luthor ever loved was his sister Lena. Meanwhile, back in the real world, Lana learns that if Superboy is not removed from the VR world soon, he will be trapped in a never ending loop of Luthor's memories. Lana becomes a part of the program herself, hoping to rescue Superboy. Back at his new lair, Luthor reveals android duplicates of himself and Lena. He says they will live on, even after everyone else on earth is gone. Luthor then activates the countdown on his death bomb.</em></p>",

Tools are found twisted and mangled, computers print countless sheets filled with the name \"Lisa,\" and strange noises are heard. While working one night, Lana is nearly blown out of the window by a gust of wind coming from inside the building. She calls in a paranormal specialist and a psychic to investigate and they discover a gun hidden in a retaining wall that is not part of the building plans. The gun fires at the wall, which Lana is standing in front of, all on its own, and Superboy appears to stop it. He smashes through the retaining wall to find a skeleton, which is likely the remains of a clarinet player named Johnny murdered 50 years ago when the Bureau was a grand ballroom called \"The Trocadel.\" The psychic claims the spirit is at rest now, but at night things go insane as the hole in the wall begins to glow and pull things and people toward it. The doors slam shut and won't open. Superboy arrives to free everyone trapped inside and try to quiet the raging spirit, but he fails. Lana, however succeeds by bringing in an elderly woman named Lisa who knew Johnny 50 years ago. Johnny told Lisa that he would wait for her there, but was killed by a mob boss he once worked for before Lisa arrived. He tells her he has been waiting for her all these years and he will still be waiting when she is ready.</em></p>",

After the encounter, Clark begins to reminisce about his aunt Cassandra and everything that she taught him as a kid but his reminiscing is cut short as he has to save the life of a young boy, and once again he encounters the ghostly woman. After a third encounter at a fire in a nursing home, Superboy begins to search for Cassandra and locates her in a cabin outside the city. She is dying of cancer and has been hearing strange music... the music the ghostly woman plays. She appears once again at Cassandra's cabin and Superboy attempts to stop her, but she is immune to all of his powers. But when Cassandra appears on the front steps of the cabin, in perfect health, it becomes clear that the ghostly woman was leading Superboy to his dying aunt so she could say goodbye.</p>",

Superman, in his Clark Kent identity, assists a doctor who operates on the creature. The doctor discovers his patient has all the organs and internal body structure of humans. Meanwhile, the Luke Benson-led mob tries to kill the other visitor from the center of the earth. That creature escapes, later bringing up more of his people along with a weapon. Superman races to defuse an explosive situation.</em> <b></b></p>",
