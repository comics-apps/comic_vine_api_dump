A few of these subgroups,the Rada Loa and Petros Loa appear in Alan Moore's miniseries starring the WildC.A.T.S. member Voodoo.",
    "description": "<h3>Spirits of Voodoo</h3><p>The Loa are a group of deities and spirits associated with the practice of Voodoo. Most are based upon traditional African gods, saints within the Catholic Church, or a mixture of both. Much like the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-44825\" href=\"/olympian-gods/4060-44825/\" slug=\"olympian-gods\">gods of Olympus</a> these deities exist in many different fictionalized comic book universes. Two major examples are the presence of Papa Legba in the history of <a data-ref-id=\"4010-31\" href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" slug=\"marvel\">Marvel</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10280\" href=\"/brother-voodoo/4005-10280/\" slug=\"brother-voodoo\">Brother Voodoo</a>, and appearances by many of the loa in stories about <a data-ref-id=\"4010-708\" href=\"/wildstorm/4010-708/\" slug=\"wildstorm\">DC/Wildstorm</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12013\" href=\"/voodoo/4005-12013/\" slug=\"voodoo\">Voodoo</a>.</p><h3>Families of Loa</h3><p>Within the loa exist many distinct families with their own specific powers and characteristics:</p><ul><li><b><span>The Rada Loa</span></b> are generally the older, more beneficent spirits who are associated with the gods of Africa. They include <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81851\" href=\"/papa-legba/4005-81851/\" slug=\"papa-legba\">Legba</a>, Loko, Ayizan, Anaisa Pye, Dhamballah Wedo and Ayida-Weddo, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81858\" href=\"/erzulie-freda/4005-81858/\" slug=\"erzulie-freda\">Erzulie Freda</a>, La Sirène, and Agwe. Their traditional color is white.</li></ul><ul><li><b><span>The Petro Loa</span></b> are often the more aggressive and warlike loa, and are associated with Haiti and the New World. They include Ezili Dantor, Marinette, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81852\" href=\"/mait-carrefour/4005-81852/\" slug=\"mait-carrefour\">Maitre Carrefour</a>. Their traditional color is red.</li></ul><ul><li><b><span>The Kongo Loa</span></b> originated from the Congo. They also include <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59319\" href=\"/marinette-bwa-chech/4005-59319/\" slug=\"marinette-bwa-chech\">Marinette</a>, a fierce and much feared female loa.</li></ul><ul><li><b><span>The Nago Load</span></b> originated from Nigeria and it includes many of the Ogoun spirits.</li></ul><ul><li><b><span>The Ghede Loa</span></b> are the spirits of the dead. They are traditionally led by the Barons (La Croix, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28868\" href=\"/baron-samedi/4005-28868/\" slug=\"baron-samedi\">Samedi</a>, Cimitière, Kriminel), and Maman Brigitte. The Ghede as a family are loud, rude (although rarely to the point of real insult), sexual, and fun. They have died already and therefore have nothing to fear, displayed in acts such as eating glass and raw chillis. Their traditional colors are black and purple.</li></ul><p>(Note: within the <a data-ref-id=\"4010-708\" href=\"/wildstorm/4010-708/\" slug=\"wildstorm\">Wildstorm Universe</a>, particularly in the 1998 <a data-ref-id=\"4050-6262\" href=\"/voodoo/4050-6262/\" slug=\"voodoo\">Voodoo</a> miniseries written by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81859\" href=\"/baron-samedi/4005-81859/\" slug=\"baron-samedi\">Baron Samedi</a> is grouped with the Rada Loa, rather than the Ghede Loa.

data-ref-id=\"4005-23744\" href=\"/joe-phat/4005-23744/\" slug=\"joe-phat\">           Joe Phat</a> for a long period of time.  He could still walk around on his own accord, but was visibly low-energy and felt sick, and couldn't remember what had happened.  She set up a nest in his apartment and sucked on his energies before <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24201\" href=\"/wally-ut/4005-24201/\" slug=\"wally-ut\">      Wally Ut</a> finally figured out what was going on and banished her.  Joe was still under her control, however, and she met up with him outside and took him to her underworld lair, where he was tied up in her webs.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84251\" href=\"/magda/4005-84251/\" slug=\"magda\">  Magda</a> saw them together and realized who she was.  She tried to break into Joe's room, but Wally had put a warding spell on it.  Kevin broke the door down and found her webs, and knew they had to rescue him.  Kevin and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23745\" href=\"/kirby-hero/4005-23745/\" slug=\"kirby-hero\">           Kirby Hero</a> finally arrived in the underground faerie realms and freed him, but Phat's hair turned white from the experience.  Joe was so drained by the experience, Kevin had to use the power of the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55696\" href=\"/excalibur/4055-55696/\" slug=\"excalibur\">     Bat</a> to re-energize him and wake him up.<br/> <br/></p><h3>Powers and Abilities </h3><p>A Leanhaun Sidhe can magically seduce almost any man.  Mirth stated that none of the males in their group (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-78386\" href=\"/sean-knight/4005-78386/\" slug=\"sean-knight\">    Sean</a>, Mirth, and Kevin) had any chance against her.  Only Edsel was capable of confronting her.  They can seduce their targets very quickly--within seconds. <br/> <br/>They have a barbed tongue with which they can stab their prey, and have clawed hands.  They can spit webs from their mouth, and are very durable.  One took a hit from Kirby that he said was one of his best punches, and she was seemingly unaffected.  However, they can be dispatched with Kevin's Bat.  They have a weakness for counting: they can't resist counting small things.  To defeat the one that captured Joe, Kirby scattered small rocks all over the floor.  She felt such a compulsion to count them that she ignored her attackers.<br/> <br/>They can change their appearance.  One changed herself to look like Edsel.  Another changed herself to look like Ishtar.  When Wally Ut confronted one in Joe Phat's room, it seems to have been wearing its natural appearance, which was as a haggard, somewhat inhuman creature.<br/></p>",

    "deck": "Five faerie creatures with dangerous poisoned spurs on their elbows.  They are the sons of the Umbra Sprite and each possess a different power.",
    "description": "<p>The Grackleflints are a group of five brother faerie that serve as the main antagonists in <a data-ref-id=\"4040-8310\" href=\"/matt-wagner/4040-8310/\" slug=\"matt-wagner\"> Matt Wagner</a>'s series <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3421\" href=\"/mage-the-hero-discovered/4050-3421/\" slug=\"mage-the-hero-discovered\"> <i>Mage: The Hero Discovered</i></a>.</p><h3>Description</h3><p>The Grackleflints are children of the evil <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84076\" href=\"/umbra-sprite/4005-84076/\" slug=\"umbra-sprite\"> Umbra Sprite</a>. Their primary mission on Earth is to find The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84078\" href=\"/fisher-king/4005-84078/\" slug=\"fisher-king\"> Fisher King</a>. The idea is that if they can spill his blood in a ritual sacrifice then darkness will gain the upper hand in its war against light. The Gracks' main disguise (created by Piet) is as identical red-headed quintuplet pit bosses at the Styx Casino. In their true forms, however they are completely hairless with pale skin and poisonous spurs on each of their elbows. This spur's poison is so dangerous that it could possibly even kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23743\" href=\"/kevin-matchstick/4005-23743/\" slug=\"kevin-matchstick\"> Kevin Matchstick</a>.  In the one circumstance that we see Gracklefint poison at work on a mortal, Lazlo uses it to kill a homeless man.  He dies in agony while hallucinating about creatures crawling over him and eating his eyes.<br/></p><h3>Powers and Abilities</h3><p>Grackleflints have a somewhat superhuman level of durability, as seen when Kevin Matchstick kicked Emil up against a wall perhaps 20' in the air, from which he then fell to the ground, and yet suffered no ill effects. Stanis also shrugged off a hit on the head from a (normal) baseball bat. This level of durability has limits, however; for instance Matchstick killed Piet with the fully-empowered version of the Bat, and Stanis was killed by a car accident and explosion. Grackleflints also probably have somewhat superhuman strength, since Stanis was able to lift the rear end of an Edsel car off the ground with one hand.</p><p>Grackleflints are fearful of water, which can cause them enough pain to go mad in extreme circumstances. Even a drop of water can scare them. Radu was stuck full-on by a large spout of water, which apparently killed him.</p><p>Each brother has a different power:</p><p>• <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84086\" href=\"/stanis-grackleflint/4005-84086/\" slug=\"stanis-grackleflint\"> Stanis</a>: flight.</p><p>• <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84084\" href=\"/lazlo-grackleflint/4005-84084/\" slug=\"lazlo-grackleflint\"> Lazlo</a>: can divine by touch or sometimes close proximity, the true nature of any creature.</p><p>• <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84083\" href=\"/piet-grackleflint/4005-84083/\" slug=\"piet-grackleflint\"> Piet</a>: can change his or another's shape.</p><p>• <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84085\" href=\"/radu-grackleflint/4005-84085/\" slug=\"radu-grackleflint\"> Radu</a>: can make himself and others invisible.</p><p>• <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84082\" href=\"/emil-grackleflint/4005-84082/\" slug=\"emil-grackleflint\"> Emil</a>: has free will. He is the only Grackleflint who does not blindly follow their father's wishes.</p><p>Emil is the only Grackleflint who manages to actually severely injure Kevin Matchstick when he spears him with one of his elbow spurs. At the end of <i>The Hero Discovered</i> all of the brothers are confirmed dead except for Emil, who is maimed and gravely wounded from his discovery of the Fisher King. Emil bashes his father's head in with a potted tobacco plant, effectively banishing him from this plane, and escapes while the Styx Casino crumbles to rubble.</p><p>Emil later becomes known as the Pale Incanter, the main antagonist of the second <i>Mage</i> series, <a data-ref-id=\"4050-6091\" href=\"/mage-the-hero-defined/4050-6091/\" slug=\"mage-the-hero-defined\"> The Hero Defined</a>. His own father comes back to defeat him in that series.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>An advanced alien race decided to share its knowledge of atomic power with the less developed Proscilican planet, hoping they will use the knowledge to advance their own civilisation. However some of the Prosilicans decided to use their new found knowledge to create nuclear weapons instead.

It was during this age that the second race came into Arda, and into being and these were the Maia. They were far greater in number, although far lesser in power than the Valar. Melkor came to Valinor, with his maiar and cast down the trees of light and made war 5 times on the Valar.</p><h2>Story Arc: War of Wrath</h2><p>During this was Melkor summoned all of his evil creatures and assembled them and prepared to wage war and destroy Valinor. The Valar and Maia and elves fell upon him and his army with such wrath that had never been seen.</p><p>His armies were decimated. His fortresses destroyed, and he was beheaded and cast into the Void. Sauron-his lieutenant was the only survivng General of his after that war.</p><h2>Lords of Valar</h2><h3>Manwë</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2413651\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2413651-manwe_sulimo.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.70786516853933\" data-width=\"267\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 267px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2413651-manwe_sulimo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2413651\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2413651-manwe_sulimo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2413651-manwe_sulimo.jpg 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\"></a></figure><p>King Of All Valinor and Arda.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>There are 2 types of Rangers who are differentiated based upon the area in which they work. <b>The Rangers of the North,</b> and the <b>Rangers of Ithilien</b> or the South. Both groups were founded a few centuries into the Third Age of the sun by Turin II the ruling steward of Gondor, who deemed that Gondor Need protection from the threats of Mordor and Minas Morgul in the North. And also the various factions of Orcs and Easterlings in the South. He formed a brotherhood of knights who would fulfil these tasks.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Rangers of Ithilien</h3><p>During the War of the Ring both rangers were called into battle for different reasons at different times. Faramir and his rangers were summoned by Denethor to hold off the orcish invasion of the former Gondorian capital of Osgiliath. This however was a very poor decision as the rangers had very little experience at fighting with others in the front line, and even less at fighting in urban environments. As a result they suffered terrible losses, losing nearly half their number. This, however was not sufficient for the insanity of Denethor who ordered the remaining 100 rangers to ride out with infantrymen to attempt to take control of Osgiliath, which was now hosting close to 100,000 orcs, and several nazgul.</p><p>They never got close. Gothmog, leader of the orcish forces, ordered 5000 orcish archers to fire on the riders. All the riders died save Faramir who himself suffered extensive wounds from arrows. This led to the decimation and collapse of the Rangers of the South.</p><p>Prior to this, Faramir found Frodo, Sam and Gollum, who all had witnessed one of their ferocious attacks on the Easterlings. He took the Hobbits to Henneth Annun where he discovered Frodo had the One Ring. However showing resilience to its power far greater than his brother he let the Hobbits go on and complete their quest.</p><p>The Rangers of the North were largely more succesful because they had been called in by the King during the battle of Pelennor fields. Aragorn who had an extensive knowledge of the rangers and how they worked used them far more strategically than Denethor. As a result the Rangers suffered comparably fewer losses than their southern counterparts.</p><p>These knights were garbed in green, and fought with bows and spears and swords. There primary area of concern was the road linking Minas Morgul to Osgiliath. They specialised in warfare not disimilar to current Guerilla tactics of stealth, sabotage and subterfuge. They planned ambushes to take out battalions often several times the number of the few hundred Rangers.</p><p>They were the most feared of Gondor's warriors. Their stealth and subtelty is a testament to their training programme because unlike their northern counterparts, to them elves were simply a thing of stories, whereas the northern rangers had 2 elves as members as well as their captain-Aragorn-having had extensive training under elves. So the fact that their stealth is on par is a tremendous feat.</p><p>Their base of operations was a dwelling of caves and tunnels that lay behind a waterfall which overlooked the Vales of Anduin. This was called the window of the sunset or Henneth Annun in elvish. During the War of the Ring the captain of the Rangers was Faramir son of Denethor the Steward of Gondor and brother of Boromir who was a member of the fellowship and a captain of Gondor. Faramir has been called the greatest of the Rangers which is an impressive feat especially considering his competition was none other than Aragorn, a member of the fellowship who would later become King of Gondor.</p><h3>Rangers of the North</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2401340-222.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2401340\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.76953125\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2401340-222.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2401340\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2401340-222.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2401340-222.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a></figure><p>These Rangers operated very differently from their southern counterparts as there were far fewer threats to the North. As a result of this they needn't travel in the small packs and employ stealth and ambushes as frequently. Instead they merely needed to make their presence known to all who passed in and around Gondor for intimidational purposes. In this respect they were tremendously successful. They are described as beig clothed in cloaks of forest green or grey, and on their left shoulder each ranger carried an emblazoned star. They were grey eyed and wore long leather boots.</p><p>To all the people's of Eriador (where they patrolled) they were regarded as strange, unfriendly people. Their intimidating presence was heightened by the mystery that surrounded them. No one knew where they had come from or who they were, merely that they rode silently on great horses. Few realised that these rangers comprised of Nobles. These include famous and powerful people such as Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor. The two sons of Elrond: Elladen and Elrohir. As a result of this elvish insertion into their ranks their skill and proficiency in skill, stealth and archery grew rapidly.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Post War of Ring and Fourth Age</h3><p>For the Rangers of the North, this was their golden age for they were rewarded generously by the King, and so lived a comfortable life. The Rangers still continued, and Aragorn resumed his leadership, however on a much smaller scaled due to the fact that the number of threats were smaller and the magnitude of them insignificant.</p><p>At this point the Rangers of Ithilien were practically non-existent due to the massacres they'd faced during the War of the Ring under Denethor. As a result Aragorn set about rebuilding them. Faramir was re-instated as Captain as well as Prince of Ithilien. Their prowess did not decrease however the number of threats they faced did.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Undying Ones are hordes of demons once controlled the Earth under the rule of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30341\" href=\"/the-nameless-one/4005-30341/\" slug=\"the-nameless-one\">Nameless One</a> more than a millennium ago, but they were eventually forced to return to their own dimension when their powers began to fade. When their powers were finally restored, the Undying Ones sought to invade the Earth once again.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Undying Ones were created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\" href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" slug=\"roy-thomas\">Roy Thomas</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3792\" href=\"/gene-colan/4040-3792/\" slug=\"gene-colan\">Gene Colan</a>. They first appeared as statues in 1969's <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-2403\" href=\"/doctor-strange/4050-2403/\" slug=\"doctor-strange\">Doctor Strange</a></i> #183, and later made their true appearance in 1970's <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2413\" href=\"/sub-mariner/4050-2413/\" slug=\"sub-mariner\"><i>Sub-Mariner</i></a> #22.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Many of the Undying Ones' invasion plans have been thwarted over the years by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\" href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" slug=\"doctor-strange\">Doctor Strange</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\" href=\"/defenders/4060-26333/\" slug=\"defenders\">Defenders</a>.</p><p>After his home dimension was destroyed because of one of the Nameless One's schemes, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32918\" href=\"/dark-crawler/4005-32918/\" slug=\"dark-crawler\">Dark-Crawler</a> single-handedly conquered the Undying Ones' dimension out of revenge.</p><p>During <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56288\" href=\"/fear-itself/4045-56288/\" slug=\"fear-itself\">Fear Itself</a>, the Undying Ones were able to come to Earth due to the rampant fear and chaos weakening the barriers that normally contained them, allowing them to possess sea-monsters and even <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13407\" href=\"/atlanteans/4060-13407/\" slug=\"atlanteans\">Atlanteans</a> in order to manifest on Earth. It fell upon Doctor Strange and an impromptu new Defenders team to drive back them back to their own dimension.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>The Undying Ones are demons with a wide variety of magical abilities and physical traits. Many of them possess superhuman strength and durability, as well as claws, fangs, and/or wings. They're immune to age and disease, and can recover from most injuries, making them effectively immortal as their name would imply. Many of the Undying Ones have also exhibited the ability to shape-shift into other forms, such as that of a human.</p>",

The war raged for centuries until finally The Kallusian were driven from their home by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59189\" href=\"/yirbeks/4060-59189/\">The Yirbeks</a>. The outnumbered Kallusians fled to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\" href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\">Earth</a> in order to repair their weapons and regroup their forces. However on landing they discovered they could not breathe in Earth's atmosphere and their supply of their own oxygen was quickly running out. Fortunately for The Kallusians, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84229\" href=\"/doctor-svenson/4005-84229/\">Doctor Svenson</a> was on an expedition in the arctic region where they had landed and stumbled upon their base. The scientist succeeded in producing the oxygen granules that allowed The Kallusins to breathe on Earth. Over the many years they were on Earth, The Kallusians managed to master English by picking up radio and television signals via thier satellite transmitters.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Kallusians were created by writers <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\" href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\">Stan Lee</a>, Paul Laiken and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-4068\" href=\"/larry-lieber/4040-4068/\">Larry Lieber</a> and artists <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\" href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-6609\" href=\"/don-heck/4040-6609/\">Don Heck</a> in 1965.</p><h2>History</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2399581-kallusians3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2399581\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 435px\" data-ratio=\"1.0367816091954\" data-width=\"435\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:103.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2399581-kallusians3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2399581\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2399581-kallusians3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2399581-kallusians3.jpg 435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" data-width=\"435\"></a></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"4060-58948\" href=\"/the-avengers/4060-58948/\">The Avengers</a> were in desperate need of Dr. Svenson as he was the only one who could perform the complicated surgery required to remove a bullet from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\" href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\">The Wasp's</a> lungs. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\">Thor</a> went in search of the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55828\" href=\"/norway/4020-55828/\">Norwegian</a> doctor in his home but instead found a Kallusian alien in disguise. The Avengers then used <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\" href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\">Mjolnir</a> to track down the real doctor to The Kallusians <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56307\" href=\"/arctic/4020-56307/\">arctic</a> base. The aliens captured the heroes but Thor broke free and attacked their captors. During the battle Dr. Svenson appeared and demanded the fighting stop else he will no longer serve The Kallusians. With no choice left, Ogor commanded his troops to cease fighting. Svenson explained The Kallusians promised no harm will come to Earth if he helps them so he stayed of his own will. Meanwhile The Yirbeks had tracked down The Kallusians to Earth and attacked one of their outposts. The Kallusians, not wishing to fight their intergalactic enemies <i>and</i> take on Earth's Mightiest Heroes, decide to release the doctor. After The Avengers departed with Svenson, Ogor told his men it's time to stop hiding and they left Earth to resume their centuries old war in space.</p>",

Grackleflints</a>.  Being the sons of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84082\" href=\"/emil-grackleflint/4005-84082/\" slug=\"emil-grackleflint\">               Emil</a> Grackleflint, now known as the Pale Incanter, they share some of his characteristics, such as pallid grey skin and a small atavistic elbow spike.  (Emil strangled their anonymous mother.)<br/> <br/>They wear skater style-clothes (black knit caps, t-shirts, baggy pants) and ride sky-boards similar to snow boards.  Each Sprigginflint wears a different color shirt, which is the only way to tell them apart.  The green-shirted Sprigginflint is Sigmund, or Sig, who is their leader and is usually the one who talks with Emil.  The blue one is Iggy, or Ignatz.  The yellow one is Ick, or Ichabod.  The red one is Fonse, or Alfonse.  The orange one is Max, or Maximillian.  (At one point early on, before Max is otherwise named in the comic, Sigmund calls him \"Polly\"; this seems to be a mistake.)<br/> <br/>They are noticeably disrespectful to their father, as he was in turn to his father, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84076\" href=\"/umbra-sprite/4005-84076/\" slug=\"umbra-sprite\">              Umbra Sprite</a>.  They speak in a broken, barely literate street style of English, swearing copiously.<br/><h3>History </h3>The Sprigginflints are first employed by their father to track down the location of the heroes, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23744\" href=\"/joe-phat/4005-23744/\" slug=\"joe-phat\">           Joe Phat</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23745\" href=\"/kirby-hero/4005-23745/\" slug=\"kirby-hero\">          Kirby Hero</a>, and especially <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23743\" href=\"/kevin-matchstick/4005-23743/\" slug=\"kevin-matchstick\">         Kevin Matchstick</a>, Emil's nemesis.  They find them, but after the heroes hook up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24201\" href=\"/wally-ut/4005-24201/\" slug=\"wally-ut\">        Wally Ut</a>, the Sprigginflints lose them.  Whereas <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45803\" href=\"/mirth/4005-45803/\" slug=\"mirth\">       Mirth</a> was a magical beacon that attracted the attention of the forces of darkness, Wally automatically takes them off their radar screen, so to

for a while, but then they all attack at once, biting him and holding on, and their poison takes him down.  The other heroes run out and skirmish with the Sprigs, driving them off.  All this time, Sigmund is the one who communicates with their father. <br/> <br/>Ich and \"Polly\" (really Max) supervise a sneak attack on Kevin and Kirby.  They send a pack of hell-hounds after them, which remind him of the Hounds that belong to the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84087\" href=\"/master-of-the-hunt/4005-84087/\" slug=\"master-of-the-hunt\">    Master of the Hunt</a>.  This memory of the original Hounds

again.  They first find a Bogart, a small mole-like faerie, and are about to attack it when the heroes intervene.  This time the heroes make a dent in the Sprigginflints' ranks: Kevin kills Ichabod with the Bat's energy blast, and the newly-arrive <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84250\" href=\"/the-presbyter/4005-84250/\" slug=\"the-presbyter\">   Presbyter</a> catches Fonse.  They interrogate him.  At first he won't reply, because he's more scared of the Incanter than he is of them.  But the Presbyter uses his hypnotic stare to get him to talk, and he gives up the fact that the Incanter is really Emil.  After getting the information they need, the heroes destroy Fonse. <br/> <br/>The remaining Sprigs later re-try their gambit with the hell-hounds, this time having them mimic the true Hounds' voices of Kevin's dead friends to make him feel even more guilty.  However it is essentially only a hit-an-run operation and they fly away again. <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\"

Sprigs try to roll a huge boulder down onto Kirby.  Kevin pushes himself out of the way, and is trapped himself, but Kirby manages to lift it off.  The heroes get into the center of the kingdom, and Emil sets the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84249\" href=\"/man-mountain-of-dzoxk/4005-84249/\" slug=\"man-mountain-of-dzoxk\">  Man-Mountain of Dzoxk</a> on them.  Emil then tells the Sprigginflints to help, but they refuse out of cowardice.  The Pale Incanter then blasts Max, killing him, a sight that inspires the other two to join the battle.  After they get in a short fight against Joe Phat, Kevin casually takes them both out in one swing. <br/> <br/>Wally Ut manages to entrap Emil in a magic prison, but Emil uses his powers to send a snake over to the body of Sigmund.  The snake crawls into Sigmund through his mouth and controls his mind.  Sigmund picks Emil's staff up off the ground and uses it to pop  the bubble of his prison.  The resulting energies incinerate Sigmund, which is the end of the Sprigginflints.<br/><h3>Powers and Abilities </h3>The Sprigginflints can fly on their sky-boards.  Their elbow spurs are not poisonous, but their teeth are.  The combined bites of all the Sprigginflints were enough to take down the giant, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24074\" href=\"/bartholomew-gretch/4005-24074/\" slug=\"bartholomew-gretch\">             Bartholomew Gretch</a>.  Otherwise we do not see them actually bite anyone.  However it can be assumed that their poison is approximately as dangerous as Grackleflint spur poison.<br/> <br/>They do not seem like particularly good fighters, being beaten by the heroes fairly easily each time, and usually flying away to safety.  Their usual style is more to harass than battle. <br/> <br/>They do not have individual powers as the Grackleflints did.",

They have more patents than any other company in the U.S. Rising Spirit creates and sells weapons. During WW2, Rising Spirit tech was found in German V-2 Rockets and Manhattan Project facilities. The organization is directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians when one of their creations, <a href=\"/bloodshot/4005-5569/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5569\">Bloodshot</a>, gunned down an entire town.

Even as the team's stories and happenings are self-contained to one title, outside of that, Betsy Braddock is frequently seen as a representation of what they stand for. Upon Pixie's addition to the team (and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40795\" href=\"/brian-wood/4040-40795/\" slug=\"brian-wood\">Brian Wood</a> taking over from Victor Gischler), Storm's tried to push the \"Security\" aspect of the team forward.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Machines of War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2412503-aware.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2412503\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.7067137809187\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:270.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2412503-aware.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2412503\"><img alt=\"First briefing\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2412503-aware.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2412503-aware.jpg 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" data-width=\"283\"></a><figcaption>First briefing</figcaption></figure><p>Their first mission as a team spiraled directly out of <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56404\" href=\"/schism/4045-56404/\" slug=\"schism\">Schism</a>. Cyclops had confirmed that there was even more fall-out from the arms conference that were discussing the usage of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\" href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" slug=\"sentinels\">Sentinels</a> to attack and/or kill mutants. In Grozny (a place the team usually comes across during their adventures) some men were selling newly revamped Sentinels to Second Parties, Cyclops made Storm aware of this and she took it on initiative that she would need to create a team for this, he clarified that and then added that were more secret, conspicuous looking men at work, and they didn't know who they were. Later on, Storm and the rest of the team take off with their own Blackbird while touching on Domino's whereabouts, all of a sudden, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\" href=\"/war-machine/4005-1926/\" slug=\"war-machine\">War Machine</a> of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\" href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" slug=\"secret-avengers\">Secret Avengers</a> stopped Storm and the rest from moving anywhere further into <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57199\" href=\"/chechen-republic/4020-57199/\" slug=\"chechen-republic\">Chechen</a> airspace. Storm and War Machine argue about the subject before Storm comes to the conclusion that they'll follow his orders and leave regardless, little did he know, she was lying.</p><p>Meanwhile, in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57791\" href=\"/puternicstan/4020-57791/\" slug=\"puternicstan\">Puternicstan</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81458\" href=\"/governor-strelonivich/4005-81458/\" slug=\"governor-strelonivich\">Governor Strelonivich</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82625\" href=\"/general-nobakov/4005-82625/\" slug=\"general-nobakov\">General Nobakov</a> are discussing the recent retrieval of Sentinels for their country, Nobakov mentioned that only one of the Sentinels gotten were of use, the other two were faulty.</p><p>Some Engineers are working on 1 of the 2 Sentinels, ominously, it awakens having detected a mutant, Domino. Immediately, she makes her escape and walks in on two armed men, she attacks them first and a huge fire-fight breaks out, she contacts Storm and Psylocke in the process, telling them about her situation, then, Domino get's approached by a Sentinel, after that, all forms of contact and communications is lost between Domino and the rest of her team. Seeing that, Storm requests that Warpath, Jubilee and Psylocke head to Domino's last location immediately, Storm and Colossus stay to distract any upcoming adversary, but before they can do that, War Machine blasts the three of them reinforcing the fact that he told them all to mind their own business, Storm insists that they leave while she deals with War Machine. Colossus tries to calm him down but War Machine reacts with a harsh punch, Peter punches him back and in annoyance, starts to let the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24949\" href=\"/cyttorak/4005-24949/\" slug=\"cyttorak\">Cyttorak</a> persona take control but Storm stops him in mid-transformation, reminding him that it's not needed.

Upon coming to somewhat of a truce, Storm, Colossus and War Machine discuss their next plan of actions, Storm and War Machine come to an agreement that it would be the best to take down as many Sentinels as they can, just as long as Domino is brought back from wherever she is. During that, Governor Strelonivich is given more info about the mutant who tried to spy on her men, Domino. She lets the General know that there are some things that she though best to keep him in the dark about. Later on, Psylocke and the two others give Storm a status update, they've infiltrated the Sentinel base and are one-by-one taking down any and all operatives that might serve as a distraction, Psylocke mentions that they haven't exactly gotten to Domino, nor do they know of her whereabouts, but at the same time, Psylocke and the others come across the two \"faulty\" Sentinels, she then notices some blueprint for up and coming work, then the trio make a shocking discovery, the base is home to more Sentinels than they could ever imagine.</p><p>Domino comes to and forces one of the scientists who took tests on her to help find the rest of her teammates, at that same time, Governor Strelonivich and the rest of her men are manning the Sentinels, they spot Colossus, Storm and War Machine near the base, she asks that one of the Sentinels apprehends them, that it does. They have re-programmed it so that mutants aren't it's only targets, just about everything else is.

It's a long fight, but they manage to get through.

Governor Strelonivich is informed that the Sentinel will eventually succumb to defeat, she notes that three of Earth's Mightiest Heroes were struggling against that one Sentinel and revels in it, taking in mind that Symkaria and other adversaries like Doom and Dracula would think twice about trying to cross any of her lines.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2414464-this.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2414464\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.0050251256281\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:200.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2414464-this.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2414464\"><img alt=\"Enter Domino\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" data-width=\"398\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2414464-this.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2414464-this.jpg 398w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Enter Domino\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2414464-this.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2414464-this.jpg 398w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" data-width=\"398\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Enter Domino</figcaption></figure><p>Domino continues to bully her captured scientist throughout the base and threatens to do worse things if he doesn't comply to her standards.

She fights back and wins it, suspecting that he would have done something of the sort. Later, Psylocke, Domino and Warpath continue their interrogation, since physical attempts weren't working, Psylocke proceeds to telepathically search his mind for answers on how to get to the Sentinel control room.

Mean while, Psylocke get's awoken by some sort of strange presence, it's the monster. It's headed in her direction, yet again, she tries to telepathically reach out to it's conciousness, figuring out what it is, and just about where it came from, she was almost overwhelmed. The monster passes her by and heads for a populated district, she chases after it.</p><p>Psylocke, in pursuit of the monster, reaches it, in the city of Quebec, with some of Storm's help. She telepathically calms the gargantuan monster back to her size, indicating to Storm, that she'll be bringing him back. Back in the jet, Storm and Colossus have a few words concerning recent happenings as Pixie tries to talk to the monster. Colossus does not agree with Storm's handling the situation, in not telling Scott about any of their escapades, they argue about it for a bit, until Dr. Hunter calls in with shocking news, the Mutantes Sans Frontiers lab was crashed and some of the samples and files were missing, in panic and noticing that they were being contacted by an interent cafe, Storm and Colossus immediately prompted her to close off the connection, letting her know that when the time arises, they will find her.</p><p>Pixie walks in on them and tells them about the monster's situation, he only speaks Russian, much to Colossus' joy. It was an ancient type, one that took Colossus half an hour to understand and get used to, he asked for his sister, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71216\" href=\"/illyana-rasputin/4005-71216/\" slug=\"illyana-rasputin\">Illyana Rasputin</a> AKA Magik to be called in, in order to get a better understanding of the situation.</p><p>Magik gives the team a low-down of what happened to Ister, the monster's name and his race, the Proto-Mutants. It was the Black Plague, it caused the humans to hunt the Proto-Mutants down to their final numbers, it was complete genocide, in short. Illyana suggested that she makes user of her time-travel powers to prevent the tragedy from happening, Storm thinks against it, baring in mind the consequences of dealing with time and the like, Illyana then suggests that they hand over the situation to the likes of X-Club, Storm thinks against that, too, much to Illyana's annoyance and surprise.</p><p>Upon entering the control room of the jet, Psylocke assures Storm that she's doing the right thing in not telling Scott. Then, something out of the ordinary happens to Storm, as she snaps out of her trance she senses something, she calls for Colossus and Magik. Psylocke, out of nowhere, senses the same thing, Pixie alerts Storm that Cyclops made a call, then, Ister drops to the floor, blood gushing from his nose and ears, Psylocke tries to grasp what's left of him, she then gets to the bottom of the mystery, the man who was doing all this, commiting such an atrocity was David Michael Gray.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2452862\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.67102615694165\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2452862\"><img alt=\"The hunt begins\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg 994w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The hunt begins\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg 994w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2452862-2452846-sec_rec.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The hunt begins</figcaption></figure><p>Learning the whereabouts of the villian that was commiting such atrocities, the team set-off to the location that Psylocke gave them. Psylocke managed to find Gray's exact position, Colossus got that and confronted Doctor Gray, he was infuriated. It didn't last long, though, as Gray offed himself, much to Colossus' annoyance. While looking through Gray's lab, Colossus stumbled upon Ister's sister, who was dead.</p><p>Later on, the team held somewhat of a grieving ceremony for the dead lives that Gray had toyed with, Psylocke mentions that now, knowing what Ister went through as well as his origin and back-story, it means something entirely different to be a mutant now, something only the Security Team are aware of. Storm comes to a conclusion that it would have been a wiser option to have told Scott from the start, as the mission ends, she calls him up.</p>",

However the onlooking Watcher melted their cannon with his unspeakable powers and then converted the entire crew into negative beings. He then dispatched them to far away planet where they could do no harm. Wondering why The Watcher had broken his vow, the Rajeki learned the planet they were planning to destroy was the home world of The Watchers thus he was not interfering in the matters of <i>others</i>!</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Rajaks were created by brothers <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/larry-lieber/4040-4068/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4068\">Larry Lieber</a> and first appeared in \"The Watcher's Power!\" in 1965.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>The Rajaks were referenced in the 2014 film \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", when Peter Quill was telling Drax the Destroyer about the various women who'd attempted to make his life miserable. One of these women is \"A smokin' hot Rajek girl\" who stabbed Quill with a fork when he missed watching a sunrise with her.</p>",

Krayt would keep the Order a secret all through the Second Galactic Civil War and the reemergence of the Lost Tribe of the Sith and Abeloth, silently observing the events that were happening in the universe at the time. Over time, Krayt nurtured the fledgling order, making it grow from some 50 members to a strong fighting force.These Sith were raised and trained on Korriban, used yorik coral for their lightsaber handles, were given black and red Sith tattoos from head to toe, and were extremely loyal to Krayt.</p><h3>Emergence</h3><p>A century later, Krayt would order his agents to sabotage the Jedi and Yuuzhan Vong project, Project Ossus, which was a terraforming project that would utilize Vong techniques to fix up worlds that had seen the worst damage during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion years earlier. As Krayt's agents sabotaged the project, the planets which were supposed to be fixed up only became inhospitable, having their plant life snuffed out and inhabitants of the worlds receiving strange growths on their bodies.</p><p>Because of this, tensions rose between the Empire and the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/galactic-federation-of-free-alliances/4060-57356/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57356\">Galactic Alliance</a>, resulting in another war. Emperor <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/roan-fel/4005-59433/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59433\">Roan Fel</a>, however, wasn't fully committed to the war effort, and thus held back his <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/imperial-knights/4060-56205/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56205\">Imperial Knights</a>, intending not to get them involved. It was at this point that Darth Krayt chose to reveal his Sith Order, lending aid to the Empire and allowing them to defeat the Galactic Alliance in a matter of years.</p><h3>Rise to Power</h3><p>Now that the Galactic Alliance had been taken care of, Krayt intended to get rid of his only other enemy - <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/jedi-order/4060-41234/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41234\">the Jedi Order.</a> Knowing the Jedi had fled to their ancient homeworld <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/jedi-order/4060-41234/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41234\">Ossus</a>, Krayt sent one of his top enforcers, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/darth-nihl/4005-45528/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45528\">Darth Nihl</a>, along with a striketeam of Sith, to the planet with orders to raze the Jedi's Temple and end their Order. The Sith and Imperial stormtroopers managed to kill many Jedi that day, and what few remained went into hiding, no longer a threat to Krayt and his One Sith.</p><p>As the attack was commencing on Ossus, Krayt took the rest of the higher ups in his Order and marched on the throne on Corsuscant, slaying the Imperial Knights guarding the \"Emperor\", as well as the \"Emperor\" himself. However, Krayt knew this was only a body double and not the real Emperor Fel, and made it his top priority to find the real one, tasking <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/darth-maladi/4005-45361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45361\">Darth Maladi</a> with the important mission. As he made the Moffs swear allegiance to him, Krayt took his place on the throne, now the new Emperor of a Sith Empire.</p><h3>Search For a Healer</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4988127\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988127-0205723439-025aa.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.2372881355932\" data-width=\"236\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 236px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988127-0205723439-025aa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4988127\"><img alt=\"Krayt with Darth Wyyrlok on Dac.\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988127-0205723439-025aa.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988127-0205723439-025aa.jpg 236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" data-width=\"236\"></a><figcaption>Krayt with Darth Wyyrlok on Dac.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the next seven years, Krayt consolidated his power and sent raiding parties out to hunt down the surviving Jedi, once again led by Darth Nihl. Eventually, Krayt would learn that a Skywalker had survived the attack on the temple seven years prior, and that he had an amazing healing ability, one that brought his master back to life from the verge of death. Krayt focused a lot of the Sith's resources and efforts into capturing this Skywalker - <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/cade-skywalker/4005-43310/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43310\">Cade Skywalker</a> - as he had contracted an unknown disease that was slowly killing him due to the experiments he had been put under as a Yuuzhan Vong prisoner. Not wanting to give up his seat of power so soon after obtaining it, Krayt set a trap for Skywalker, eventually capturing him and attempting to convince him to join the Sith. At this time, many of his followers began to question Krayt, most notably his second-in-command, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/cade-skywalker/4005-43310/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43310\">Darth Wyyrlok</a>.</p><p>After a few weeks, Skywalker would escape Coruscant and eventually fall into the hands of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/celeste-morne/4005-50886/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50886\">Celeste Morne</a>, an ancient Jedi who harbored a deep hate for Sith. Taunting Krayt and goading him into a trap, Morne, along with Skywalker and a force of Jedi and Imperial Knights, attempted to kill Krayt, stabbing him through the chest, hitting him with Force Lightning, and knocking him off a cliff. Believing their Emperor dead, the Sith fled the planet, all except Wyyrlok. He found Krayt at the bottom of the cliff, barely clinging to life. However, instead of bringing him back for medical help, Wyyrlok shocked him with his own Force Lightning, believing he himself had killed Krayt and become the new ruler of the One Sith.</p><h3>Under Wyyrlok</h3><p>Darth Wyyrlok knew that the majority of the One Sith wouldn't willingly follow him, so he had Krayt's body transferred to a stasis chamber on Korriban in case any Sith had wondered where their Emperor had gone. Since Wyyrlok had been at Krayt's side through his many trips in Healing Trances throughout the years, no one wold think twice about the idea of Krayt going into stasis to \"heal himself\" while Wyyrlok handed out his orders for him.</p><p>Despite this, many Sith began to suspect that Wyyrlok had indeed killed Krayt and that he just wanted the throne for himself. To gain his trust, Wyyrlok appointed Darth Nihl as his Hand and tasked him to Korriban. Afterwards, Wyyrlok ordered the complete annihilation of the Mon Calamari species through the poisoning of their oceans, believing doing so would keep the galaxy in check.</p><p>After learning of a secret meeting between Imperial and Jedi forces, members of the One Sith would interrupt Roan Fel and the Jedi Order on Agamar, attacking both sides in an attempt to get rid of both parties at once. Although Fel escaped the battle, the Sith were able to capture his daughter, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/marasiah-fel/4005-64042/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64042\">Marasiah Fel.</a></p><p>On Korriban, Darth Nihl visited Krayt's tomb only to find his armor without any body inside. Believing Darth Talon had killed him, he engaged the female Sith in a duel. However, Nihl would find out the truth about Darth Krayt soon enough; he had survived and had been reborn stronger than ever. Calling out to all the dark side users in the galaxy, Krayt made his rebirth known to the One Sith, prompting an inevitable confrontation between himself and Wyyrlok with the results of their duel being rule over the Sith and their Empire.</p><h3>Confrontation</h3><p>Darth Krayt made his way back to Coruscant with Nihl and Talon and challenged Wyyrlok for rule of the Empire. Many of the Sith present were loyal to Wyyrlok, some to Krayt, and others would pledge themselves to whoever won, the stronger Sith. The two engaged in an impressive duel, both wielding powerful Force attacks and utilizing amazing lightsaber skills. The fight would see Darth Krayt the victory, however, and he would assume his role once again as ruler of the One Sith.</p><h3>Going into Hiding</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4988143\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988143-0062961725-latest\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.2188841201717\" data-width=\"233\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 233px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988143-0062961725-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4988143\"><img alt=\"Darth Nihl\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px\" data-width=\"233\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988143-0062961725-latest\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988143-0062961725-latest 233w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Darth Nihl\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988143-0062961725-latest\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4988143-0062961725-latest 233w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px\" data-width=\"233\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Darth Nihl</figcaption></figure><p>As the war with the Fel Empire, Jedi Order, and remnants of the Galactic Alliance came to an end, the One Sith engaged their enemies in a massive battle on Coruscant, which would decide the fate of the galaxy at large. After brutal fighting, Darth Krayt fell in battle to Cade Skywalker and the Sith Empire was defeated. With Krayt and Wyyrlok gone, Darth Nihl was next in line as leader of the Sith.</p><p>Nihl ordered the remaining Sith to disperse, go into hiding, and infiltrate any governments they could in order to have power should they rise again. The One Sith complied, going into hiding and dispersing among governments around the galaxy.</p><h3>Final Battle</h3><p>Some years later, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/darth-wredd/4005-91270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-91270\">Darth Wredd</a>, a Sith apprentice turned Dark Lord, began to identify and kill members of the One Sith that had gone into hiding as part of his plan to rid the Sith from the galaxy for the pain they caused him. After hunting him down to the planet Mala, the remaining One Sith forces battled against the Galactic Triumvirate who were also trying to catch Wredd. After a long and brutal battle, the One Sith had been defeated, ending their order once and for all.</p><h2>Ranks</h2><p>As leader of the One Sith, Darth Krayt implemented ranks and divisions for his Sith Order because he had many Sith to work with after quitting the Rule of Two. The ranks are as follows:</p><h3>Voice/Regent</h3><p>The second in command of the One Sith. Members of this position provided services to the reigning Dark Lord of the Sith such as caretaking, protection, and advising.

Two Maiar came, Curumo (Curunir or Saruman) sent by Aule, and Alatar, sent by Orome. Manwë asked where Olorin (Gandalf) was, and he came, after returning from a journey. Manwë asked Olórin (Gandalf) if he would go as the third messenger. Olórin said that he was too weak, and he was afraid of Sauron. Manwë said that that was all the more reason to go, and that he commanded Olórin to go as the third. Then Varda said \"Not as the third.\" Yavanna begged Curumo to take Radagast, and Alatar took Pallando as a friend.</p><p>They were forbidden to dominate the peoples of Middle-earth or to match Sauron's power with power. When Saruman, the greatest of the Wizards, disobeyed this injunction, he was cast from the order and banished from the Undying Lands (Valinor).</p><h2>Arrival and Second Age</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2412229-staffs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2412229\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.72348484848485\" data-width=\"264\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 264px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2412229-staffs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2412229\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2412229-staffs.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123064/2412229-staffs.jpg 264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" data-width=\"264\"></a></figure><p>Most were given different names from before they had come and they arrived in different colours of clothing from each other, and they were called <b>Wizards</b>. Many of these wizards came to the northwestern regions of <a href=\"/middle-earth/4020-56636/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56636\">Middle-Earth</a> . The chiefs of those that came to Middle-earth were five in number. When the five Istari came to Middle-earth sent by the Valar they where known as the <b>Order of Wizards</b>. After they have arrived, the two Blue Wizards (Alatar and Pallando) went into the east and no one heard from them again. Radagast, the Brown wizard liked the nature, animals and other creatures, and so he lived in Mirkwood amongst the Sindarin Elves, befriending Beorn and his perople, and lived there for many years.</p><p>The other two wizards, Curunir and Olórin have gone to the other elves, Dwarves and Men. Curunir, now known as Saruman was wise and respected enough by all that he had become head of the Istari in TA 2463. He also befriended Treebeard and walked in his forests. He was given Orthanc by Gondor as a base as a reward for his services. Here he discovered an ancient Palantir, and from there Sauron began his corruption.</p><p>Soon, his pride made him get jealous of Gandalf who was given one of the 3 rings of the Elves. This caused him to slowly betray the original purpose of the Istari as he slowly made plans to acquire the One Ring.</p><h2>The Hobbit</h2><p>During this period, 3 of the Istari are influential: <a href=\"/gandalf/4005-62740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62740\">Gandalf</a>, <a href=\"/saruman/4005-62765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62765\">Saruman</a> and Radagast. Although the latter had the smallest part to play. We first meet Gandalf, during the Hobbit when he assembles his dwarven clan for a \"Treasure Hunt\". Along the way the group travel to Mirkwood where they meet Radagast who is enjoying himself amongst the flora and fauna. Thy have an amazing adventure which results in the great War of Five Armies. During this time, Saruman was sending many of his Uruk-Hai to scour the river where the ring was last seen, and start building his army.</p><p>He has also sent his envoy Grima Wormtongue to Rohan where Saruman takes control of King Theoden's mind and so exerts his control over Rohan.</p><p>During this time the blue wizards (Alatar and Pallando) are said to have instigated the Easterling and Haradarim religion and may have brought the into the War of The Ring.</p><h3>The War of The Ring</h3><p>The biggest Istari involvement here is in the first part. Following the discovery of the Ring, Gandalf goes to Saruman to report his findings. Along the way he encounters Radagast who tells him how Saruman has changed. Gandalf and Saruman have a disagreement regarding what to do with the Ring. Saruman has already been corrupted and believes that they should use the ring to overthrow Sauron. They have a short fight during which despite dealing some injuries to the head of the White council Gandalf loses. He is imprisoned upon the top of orthanc. Fortunately Gandalf summoned his friend Gwaihir, the Lord Of The Great Eagles of Manwe.</p><p>Gandalf returns to the fellowship and leads them through the Mines of Moria, where he encounters one of the Last Balrogs, Durin's Bane. Here he defeats his fellow maia however at the cost of his own life. He was returned to life however by Eru who decided his help was still needed. He was returned as Gandalf the White and was given all the power and authority Saruman should have had.</p><p>During this time Saruman sends his first wave of Uruk-hai to hunt down the ring and capture the halflings who carry it. These Uruks cause the splitting up of the Fellowship, with Frodo and Sam going to Mordor and <a href=\"/aragorn/4005-62741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62741\">Aragorn</a>, <a href=\"/legolas/4005-62762/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62762\">Legolas</a> and <a href=\"/gimli/4005-62763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62763\">Gimli</a> pursuing the captured Merry and Pippin, and the death of Boromir.</p><p>Saruman is overthrown from Rohan by Gandalf and The Three Hunters (Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli) who throw out Grima causing Theoden to regain control. In retaliation Saruman launches his entire army to Helm's Deep where they are ultimately annihalated. Orthanc is overcome by Ents, following The Last March Of The Ents led by Treebeard. Saruman is imprisoned alongside Grima.</p><p>In the film Grima kills Saruman atop Orthanc while they are both imprisoned. In the books and comics Grima and Saruman return to the Shire (albeit powerless) and under the name of Sharkey Saruman instigates a rebellion and seizes control until he is fought by Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin who have returned from overthrowing Sauron. He is then killed by Grima who slits out his throat (in the film he is stabbed in the back twice).</p><p>Following this only Gandalf is spoken of leaving Middle Earth for Valinor giving up his ring (Narya, ring of fire) taking with him Frodo and Bilbo.</p>",

    "deck": "A traveling circus that was once home to the Flying Graysons, and is currently owned by their son, Dick Grayson.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Haly's Circus, more completely referred to as C.C. Haly and Norton Bros. Circus, and occasionally known as Haley's Circus, was formed by <a href=\"/cc-haly/4005-80615/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80615\">CC Haly</a> and the Norton Brothers. It is a typical travelling circus that has been known to perform in the United States and <a href=\"/europe/4020-56099/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56099\">Europe</a>, and hosts a variety of performers, including acrobats, jugglers, and trained animals. The Circus' most notable performers were the trapeze act known as the <a href=\"/flying-graysons/4060-55863/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55863\">Flying Graysons</a>. </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Haly's Circus was created by <a href=\"/bob-kane/4040-19137/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-19137\">Bob Kane</a> and <a href=\"/bill-finger/4040-43591/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43591\">Bill Finger</a>. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Flying Graysons </h3><p>Haly's Circus travels into <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham</a>, where they are set to perform. The ringmaster is confronted by <a href=\"/anthony-zucco/4005-22815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22815\">Anthony Zucco</a> and <a href=\"/edward-skeevers/4005-77701/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77701\">Edward Skeevers</a>, who demand protection money from the Circus as well as the use of their trucks to transport drugs. When the ringmaster refuses to give into their threats, Zucco and Skeevers sabotage the trapezes of the Circus' most popular act, the Flying Graysons. This causes the elder Graysons, <a href=\"/john-grayson/4005-6844/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6844\">John</a> and <a href=\"/mary-grayson/4005-38117/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38117\">Mary</a>, to plunge to their deaths, leaving their son <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson</a> orphaned. <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> assists the Circus on behalf of Grayson, who he adopts, helping to expose Zucco's part in the tragedy and free the Circus from the threat. </p><h3>The Court of Owls</h3><p>The Circus is revealed to have ties with the mysterious <a href=\"/court-of-owls/4060-58693/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58693\">Court of Owls</a> which controls Gotham from the shadows. The Court selects the best of the Circus' youth and trains them to become the next <a href=\"/the-talons/4060-59016/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59016\">Talon</a>. This practice has been going on for an indeterminate number of years, presumably several decades. Grayson was selected as a Talon, but was adopted by Bruce Wayne before he could be formally recruited.</p><h3>Saiko</h3><p>One of the Court's rejected Talons, Raymond, takes on the identity of <a href=\"/saiko/4005-79618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79618\">Saiko</a> and makes it his mission to destroy the Circus in retribution for what he suffered at the hands of the Court. He also targets Dick Grayson, who he blames for his misfortunes. In collusion with <a href=\"/raya-vestri/4005-80320/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80320\">Raya Vestri</a> and <a href=\"/bryan-haly/4005-80616/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80616\">Bryan Haly</a>, Saiko causes the death of Mr Haly, the owner of the Circus, and comes close to destroying the Circus completely. He is prevented from doing so by Grayson. The ownership of the Circus then passes to Grayson. </p><h2>Alternate Versions </h2><h3>Flashpoint </h3><p>In the <a href=\"/flashpoint/4045-56280/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56280\">Flashpoint</a> universe, Haley's Circus is home to the Graysons, <a href=\"/deadman/4005-5690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5690\">Boston Brand</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-fate/4005-5898/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5898\">Doctor Fate</a>, <a href=\"/king-shark/4005-17772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17772\">King Shark</a>, and <a href=\"/ragdoll/4005-11251/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11251\">Ragdoll</a>, among others. The Circus, travelling through Europe and fleeing the war, is attacked by the <a href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/4060-42494/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42494\">Amazons</a> who are searching for the <a href=\"/helmet-of-fate/4055-56063/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56063\">Helm of Nabu</a>. The members of the Circus scatter, and several of them die in the attack or its aftermath.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Animation</h3><p><b>The DCAU </b></p><p>Haly's Circus appears in the <i>Batman: the Animated Series</i> episode \"<em>Robin's Reckoning Part 1</em>\", which details Dick Grayson's origin.</p><p><b><i>Teen Titans </i></b></p><p>The Grayson's deaths, and by extension the Circus, appears briefly in a flashback in the episode \"<em>Haunted</em>\". </p><p><b><i>The Batman </i></b></p><p>The Circus appears in the episode \"<em>A Matter of Family</em>\", which features Grayson's origin. </p><p><b><i>Young Justice </i></b></p><p>The members of <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a> go undercover in the Circus in the episode \"<em>Performance</em>\" to investigate a weapons thief.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Toad Men were launching an invasion of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\" href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" slug=\"earth\"> Earth</a> using a form of magnetic technology to remove entire cities and bodies of water from the planet's surface. They kidnapped <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\" href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" slug=\"hulk\"> Bruce Banner</a> to learn how advanced Earth is but when their conquest seemed imminent, Banner used a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-56052\" href=\"/gamma-rays/4015-56052/\" slug=\"gamma-rays\"> gamma ray</a> device to reverse to polarity of the Toad Men's magnetic weapons and launch their fleet out of the solar system.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Tribitites were created by writer/editor <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\" href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" slug=\"stan-lee\"> Stan Lee</a> and artist <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\" href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" slug=\"jack-kirby\"> Jack Kirby</a> and first appeared in \"Enter the Toad Men\" in 1962.</p><h2>Major Story Arc</h2><p>The Toad Men were attempting to enslave The Hulk. Their species existed on a mechanical planet called Toadworld, built using technology stolen from the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\" href=\"/kree-empire/4060-7588/\" slug=\"kree-empire\"> Kree</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\" href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" slug=\"skrulls\"> Skrull</a> and other technologically advanced <a data-ref-id=\"4015-46567\" href=\"/aliens/4015-46567/\" slug=\"aliens\"> alien</a> races. Toadworld required a large amount of slave labor to operate successfully. When the Toad Men learned of the Hulk's potential connection to the powerful entity known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13889\" href=\"/shaper-of-worlds/4005-13889/\" slug=\"shaper-of-worlds\"> Shaper of Worlds</a>, they forced him to attack the Shaper and return him to Toadworld to do their bidding. In order to make him comply, the Toad Men threatened the lives of Hulk's friends <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12068\" href=\"/jarella/4005-12068/\" slug=\"jarella\"> Jarella</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52119\" href=\"/cracka-jack-jackson/4005-52119/\" slug=\"cracka-jack-jackson\"> Cracka-Jack Jackson</a> but unknown to the Hulk, these were apparitions created by the Shaper. In his weakened state the Shaper was unable to maintain the apparitions, leading Hulk to go on a rampage that destroyed equipment essential to the planet's operation. Toadworld then spiraled out of orbit and into <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56254\" href=\"/space/4020-56254/\" slug=\"space\"> deep space</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ever since the appearance of the Hell's Gate and the Heaven's Gate, Contractors have been popping up all over the world. Although they range in the thousands, Contractors have been kept a secret from the general public. Each Contractor possesses a unique ability. Along with these abilities come two other unusual traits. The first being the need to perform an obeisance, an odd payment that varies between Contractors and the other being the loss of human emotion. Most (or all) Contractors possess a more logical world view, choosing the more rational decisions. Originally, it was though that Contractors are unable to form meaning or emotional bonds with other people, but this was proven wrong when it was shown that November 11, April, and July actually cared for each others well-being, referring to each other as \"friends\". A common trait among contractors is the need for self-preservation. Contractors are known for doing anything, whether it be to kill, spy, leak information, or even betray a comrade if it meant preserving their own life. Although Contractors are generally emotionless, many maintain certain human emotions such as joy, love, sorrow, and anger. It was later revealed that Contractors are in fact able to express and feel many and all human emotions. Why Contractors exist and how the Hell's Gate and Heaven's Gate are connected to their unique abilities is still a mystery. While most known Contractors became the way they are due to the appearance of the Hell's Gate and Heaven's Gate, other people have been known to be born Contractors (after gates appearance). In some cases, people become Contractors later on in their lives, although the reason for this is unknown. Another type of Contractor is a Moratorium. Like Contractors, Moratoria possess unique abilities. Unlike an ordinary Contractor, they maintain the full emotions and mindset of an ordinary human, but lack control of their powers.</p>",

Fearing his planet would be next, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3518\" href=\"/randau/4005-3518/\" slug=\"randau\">Randau</a> the King of Xeron went through an experimental procedure to give himself the powers of Xeron's third sun. This converted him from a just monarch of peace into a mutated hate filled conqueror.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Xeronians were created by writer <a data-ref-id=\"4040-43812\" href=\"/gary-friedrich/4040-43812/\" slug=\"gary-friedrich\">Gary Friedrich</a> and artist <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3492\" href=\"/marie-severin/4040-3492/\" slug=\"marie-severin\">Marie Severin</a>. They first appeared in \"And Now...the Space Parasite!\" in 1968.</p><h2>Major Story Arc</h2><p>After defeating the invading threat, King Randau decided to leave Xeron and continue his blood lust by exploring the universe for any potential threats to his people. However over time the Xeronians realised that Randau had become a parasite that needed to feed on the energy of his defeated foes to stay alive. Years later the Xeronians tracked their former king to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\" href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" slug=\"earth\">Earth</a> where he was battling <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\" href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" slug=\"hulk\">The Hulk</a> and decided Randau must die. Defeat at the hands of Hulk had taken Randau to the brink of death and he decided to teleport back to his ship and return to Xeron and die on home soil. However just before he reached his ship, the Xeronians detonated the self destruct mechanism thinking Randau was on board and hoping to kill him. Realising he now had no home to go to, the Space Parasite lay on a floating piece of debris and waited for death.</p>",

Lokar was so superstitious that despite his desire for conquest, he wouldn't attempt an invasion of the neighbouring planet Parthea unless he received a favourable omen. One day Lokar saw his omen in the form of a brilliant explosion of light in the sky. The Venturan army were ordered to prepare their starships for an attack. However on closer inspection the light turned out to be a falling star that would shortly collide with Venturas and destroy the planet. Hearing this Lokar ordered the guns be removed from their ships so all the citizens could board. The star collided with Venturas as soon as the ships had taken off, turning the would be conquerors into refugees who now have to plead with the Partheans for asylum.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Venturans were created by brothers <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\" href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" slug=\"stan-lee\">Stan Lee</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-4068\" href=\"/larry-lieber/4040-4068/\" slug=\"larry-lieber\">Larry Lieber</a> and first appears in \"The Omen\" in 1964.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Initially formed by Mandarin and Ezekiel Stane this group consisted of a number of villains and their spiritual successors recruited both voluntarily and forcibly as part of the duos plan to wage war on the world and defeat Iron Man and his allies. The group were each upgraded into cyborgs by Stane and granted new upgraded armors by the Mandarin and launched on various terrorist attacks across the world in order to strike fear into the worlds governments and humiliate Iron Man. Largely operating in pairs the group launched many attacks under Mandarins direction including destroying the Three Gorges dam in China, freezing Dubai's entire fresh water supply and most notably were believed to have killed James Rhodes in battle. As well as these tasks the group was tasked with obtain resources used in the construction of the titanomechs. Following Mandarins down fall at the hands of defectors Ezekiel Stane, Blizzard, Whirlwind and Living Laser alongside their archenemy Iron man, the group largely went their separate ways only occasionally working together when the situation requires it.</p>",

Iron Man used a suit specially designed for the task but instead of destroying the Phoenix it was split into five parts.

X-Men event comic book.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>To begin with, the Phoenix Five used their powers to change the earth to create a peaceful and advanced place to live. Many struggling areas were given the climates needed to sustain themselves and <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/4020-41752/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41752\">Utopia</a> underwent major changes. They provided free, clean and nigh unlimited energy to everyone and banned the use of weapons.</p><p>As the fight continued however, the Five showed continuous signs of corruption such as Namor's invasion of Wakanda and when Emma Frost murdered someone who had accidentally killed a mutant years before.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Avengers Vs. X-Men</h3><p>The Avengers were wary of the great power of the Phoenix Five and decided to create a strike force to capture Hope in case the Five went too far. After a brief confrontation the Avengers managed to escape with Hope after Scarlet Witch aided them. In retaliation the Five declared the Avengers to be enemies and started to hunt them down.</p><p>When Namor discovered the Avengers were hiding in Wakanda he lead an army of Atlanteans against the country. After much destruction the Avengers were able to defeat Namor just as the rest of the Phoenix Five arrived. As Namor lay on the floor his portion of the Phoenix entered the others taking Namor back to his previous levels of power while improving the rest. The Avengers narrowly escaped by entering a portal to K'un-Lun.</p><p>During the ensuing fights between the Avengers and the X-Men, the Phoenix Five were successful in capturing a lot of the Avengers, including Thor. The Avengers decided to reclaim their comrades but in doing so, Spider-Man was trapped in Limbo with Colossus and Magik. Spider-Man managed to manipulate the siblings into attacking each other to gain the other's portion of power. With Colossus and Magik eliminated, only Cyclops and Emma remained as hosts of the Phoenix.</p><p>After Emma discovered that the Avengers were hiding in K'un Lun using her vast telepathic powers, Cyclops attacked hoping to recapture Hope. The Avengers threw everything they had against Cyclops including a mystical dragon that had defeated the Phoenix force years before. Unfortunately for the Avengers, the dragon was not yet powerful enough to defeat the Phoenix and was beaten. After it seemed that Cyclops was going to succeed in his mission, Hope somehow managed to harness the power of the dragon and Scarlett Witch to get rid of Cyclops, sending him to the moon where he was severely injured.</p><p>Realizing he needed more power, Cyclops rushed to Emma in Utopia to keep the whole of the Phoenix Force in one place. There he found that Emma had been almost entirely corrupted by the Phoenix, attempting to convince him to completely destroy the world and remake it in their own image.</p><p>At that moment, the last remaining Phoenix Avatars were attacked by the combined might of the Avengers and the X-men while simultaneously attacked by <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor Charles Xavier</a> on the astral plane. The combined assault was too much for the divided Phoenix Force and Scott, in his desperation, attacked Emma. Taking her portion of the Phoenix Force, he became the sole Phoenix Avatar, putting an end to the Phoenix Five.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Marvel: Avengers Alliance</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/119711/2679947-2604861_269155_391057040966374_2068103605_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2679947\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/119711/2679947-2604861_269155_391057040966374_2068103605_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2679947\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/119711/2679947-2604861_269155_391057040966374_2068103605_n.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/119711/2679947-2604861_269155_391057040966374_2068103605_n.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/119711/2679947-2604861_269155_391057040966374_2068103605_n.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/119711/2679947-2604861_269155_391057040966374_2068103605_n.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></a></figure><p>The Phoenix Five appear in the third Special Operation for the Facebook game designed by Playdom, <i>Marvel: Avengers Alliance</i>. The player has the option of playing either the X-Men or Avengers side of the Avengers vs X-Men conflict. The story-line is different however to Avengers versus X-Men. A notable change is that the members of the Phoenix Five in the game are different with Jean Grey taking Namor's place. The reward for completing this Special Operation is getting Magik as a playable character.</p>",
