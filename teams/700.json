    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Pre-Crisis: The Batmen of All Nations. By 1950, the legend of <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> and what he stood for had circled the globe. Tales of a man who against all odds built himself into a crime-fighting icon inspired others to imitate him and his partner(s) in the US and also abroad.</p><h3><u>The Knight and Squire</u></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/knight/4005-6525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6525\"><b>Knight</b></a> and <a href=\"/squire/4005-6527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6527\"><b>Squire</b></a>'s home is Wordenshire, an English village. This father and son team were known in everyday life as the Earl of Wordenshire and young Cyril. The Knight himself was clad in golden armor and chain mail. Squire, on the other hand, wore a matching tunic and archer's cap.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Inspired by the story of the <a href=\"/bat-signal/4055-55819/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55819\">Bat-Signal</a>, this dynamic duo arranged with the townspeople that whenever they needed help or there was trouble coming, they would sound the rectory bell. Instead of a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batmobile/4055-41463/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\">Batmobile</a> or <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batcycle/4055-49765/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-49765\">Batcycle</a>, these modern cavaliers rode on motorcycles, continuing their Knight theme by mounting horse's heads on the front of the vehicle.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Before this however, Nazi spies had been captured near Stonehenge. They had been rumored to have hidden gold, which they had stolen. Of course, fortunes of gold, even stolen gold attracts attention, so it was no surprise when a band of <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham</a> villains, led by <a href=\"/crime-doctor/4005-9335/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9335\">Matt Thorne</a>, headed for the site of the spies' trial, Wordenshire.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When the Gotham dynamic duo went to England to pursue the villains, they inevitably met their British counterparts. It was not a favorable occasion for when the Knight and the Squire entered the fray, they got between Batman &amp; Robin and the Thorne band, which took the opportunity in the confusion to escape. Batman attempted to diminish the awkwardness of the whole situation by suggesting the foursome swap partners, allowing the relatively inexperienced British heroes to learn the ropes from their idols.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, this idea and the situation about it proved to be less than ideal. The Squire was held hostage by Thorne, forcing Batman let the villains fled from Stonehenge. Afterward, the Knight was nearly electrocuted forcing Robin to save him while Thorne escaped yet again.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Adding to the whole affair, Thorne had found the gold of all places, beneath the Earl of Wordenshire's own castle. Batman and Robin allowed the Knight and Squire capture the villains, as it was their home. However, Unfortunately, Thorne, spotting the war-horses in the Knight's version of the <a href=\"/batcave/4020-31340/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31340\">Batcave</a>, deduced the hero's identities and said as much to the assembled reporters and police. Fortunately, the theory failed to hold up as the Earl and Cyril appeared opposite the Knight and Squire to inquire what was going on. As always, Batman and Robin's expertise with make-up and disguise was flawless.</p><h3><u>The Wingman</u></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After meeting the Knight and Squire, another bat-similar hero appeared. This hero, who was an American citizen of an undefined European nationality, had learned from the previous people’s mistakes and requested the Dark Knight train him first. Simultaneously, <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson</a> broke a leg, which forced him to the sidelines for six weeks. This meant the new <b>Wingman</b> (clad in a red and yellow costume) would serve as Batman's partner.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dick became convinced he was going to be permanently replaced. Fueling his fears were comments among Gothamites that an adult made a more appropriate ally for Batman than a child. Even more upsetting, Dick overhead a comment on his belt radio by <a href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Commissioner Gordon</a>: \"We don't need any Robin, Batman!\"</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The final blow to Dick was when he saw on TV footage, which showed Wingman flawlessly rescuing Batman from a rooftop robbery. Back in the Batcave, the new hero refused to reveal his identity to the unmasked Robin. In tears, Dick confronted Bruce later only to learn that the Wingman he'd met earlier was Bruce himself. He and Wingman had swapped identities for the night and Bruce had met Robin in that guise to test its effectiveness. If the Boy Wonder couldn't see through it, no one could. To relieve Dick even more, Commissioner Gordon's earlier comment, Batman added, had simply been a statement about how the European nation didn't require a substitute Robin. Embarrassed over his jealously, Dick couldn't help but express his joy that he and Batman would continue as the Dynamic Duo.</p><h3><u>Batmen of All Nations</u></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In late 1954, inspired by a letter from Australia's <b><a href=\"/dark-ranger/4005-46380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46380\">Ranger</a> </b>(a masked man in a brown shirt and hat), and the increase in \"Batmen of All Nations\" members, Batman decided to hold a conference for his counterparts. Those in attendance included France's sword-wielding <b><a href=\"/musketeer/4005-46381/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46381\">Musketeer</a></b> (clad in the trademark uniform), Italy's <b><a href=\"/legionary/4005-46384/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46384\">Legionary</a></b> (armed with a lance and dressed like a Roman centurion), South America's <b><a href=\"/gaucho/4005-46379/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46379\">Gaucho</a></b> (renowned for his skill with the bolo) and, finally, <b>the Knight and Squire</b>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The heroes all arrived in Gotham to a spectacular ticker-tape parade. Afterwards, Batman began a quick overview of his techniques. Casting a pall over the proceedings was the boast of a mobster named \"Knots\" Cardine \"to commit unprecedented crimes under the very noses of these great lawmen.\" Rising to the challenge, the heroes took off in the direction of Cardine's first reported robbery, the Gaucho and Ranger riding their horses, the Knight and Squire astride their vehicular counterparts, and the rest crammed into the <a href=\"/batmobile/4055-41463/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\">Batmobile</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Knots’ gang managed to escape and amazingly evaded multiple roadblocks. Only the Legionary seemed to have spotted anything, a unique series of scratches on the side of the getaway car, \"a<i>s though by bushes, so their hideout must be in a thickly-wooded country region</i>.\" The fact that Batman had missed the clue and seemed to be at a loss to explain Cardine's getaway shook the confidence of the other Batmen, but they kept their opinions to themselves.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Riding with Batman and Robin, the Legionary spotted the bushes that he imagined had scratched Cardine's vehicle. Batman went ahead to investigate an abandoned house in the wooded area and the other heroes could only watch helplessly as the structure exploded in a fireball. The Dark Knight, it seemed, was dead.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">With Gotham in a state of shock, the international heroes vowed to avenge him. Taking over as their leader, the Legionary offered to ride with the armored van and, at an opportune moment, pulled a gun on the driver.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Cardine's gang poured out of the woods and the door of the truck was opened to reveal — Batman! With the aid of the others, the thieves were quickly rounded up. The Legionary was unmasked as Cardine, who'd abducted the true Roman hero the moment he landed in the United States.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Batman had been suspicious from the start and allowed the Legionary to take the lead in the investigation. As a precaution, the Dark Knight threw his <a href=\"/batarang/4055-46297/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46297\">batarang</a> into the supposed hideout. When it exploded, he allowed Robin and the others to believe him dead until he could draw Cardine's gang into the open. \"Knots\" had kept his mob abreast of the heroes' plans thanks to \"<i>a walkie-talkie mike inside his helmet, with his spear for an aerial</i>.”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">\"<i>To think that for a moment I doubted your ability, Batman!</i>\" the Musketeer admitted. \"<i>I apologize</i>.\"</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">\"Si,\" added the Gaucho. \"There is, after all, only one real Batman in the world!\"</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3><u>\"The Club of Heroes\"</u></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 1957, the international heroes (minus the Ranger) gathered in the US a second time, this time at the invitation of <a href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis</a> millionaire and philanthropist John Mayhew.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Years before <a href=\"/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10149\">Maxwell Lord</a> funded the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League</a>, Mayhew offered <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>, Batman, Robin, and the others a skyscraper complex that he dubbed \"The Club of Heroes.\" He offered to sign over the deed for the property to whomever the group chose as their chairman.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Superman and Batman each insisted that the other was most deserving. Mayhew suggested a solution: \"<i>Whoever performs the greatest feats in the next few days will be your chairman.</i>\" In an amusing display of modesty, both Superman and Batman performed subsequent crime fighting activities with as much discretion as possible, even the international heroes down played their own efforts in favor of the two icons.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Abruptly, though, Superman was laid low by a mysterious illness reminiscent of <a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">kryptonite</a> poisoning. In addition, a new hero named Lightning-Man, clad in an orange costume with a purple cape and cowl, came on the scene. Even as Lightning-Man's displays of heroism racked up, from dispersing a tornado to preventing an airplane crash, Superman and Batman suspected the worst. They feared the new crime buster wanted to claim the chairmanship of the Club—and property—for himself.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As Superman's sick spells continued at twenty-four hour intervals, Batman began to form a new conclusion, one that the Man of Steel ultimately confirmed. A fragment of a kryptonite asteroid had entered Earth's orbit. As it passed over Metropolis each day, Superman fell into a sickly, amnesiac state.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">\"<i>Your strong instincts to prevent disaster, and to keep your identity secret, still moved you to action</i>,\" the Dark Knight explained. \"<i>And so, unaware who you really were, you yourself became Lightning-Man. And each time, when the kryptonite amnesia-influence passed away, you couldn't remember that you'd been Lightning-Man</i>.\"</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">To the cheers of the others, Batman told the Man of Steel, \"<i>You won the chairmanship fairly as Lightning-Man, so we insist as Superman, you keep it.\"</i></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">\"<i>I might have known all the time</i>,\" added <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a>, \"NO ONE <i>could ever top Superman, except himself!</i>\"</p><h2>Post-Crisis: The Dome</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">These heroes didn’t appear again until 1988, when Roy Thomas used the original stories as a springboard, and tied the Club of Heroes to the histories of both the <a href=\"/all-star-squadron/4060-41753/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41753\">All-Star Squadron</a> and the <a href=\"/global-guardians/4060-30109/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-30109\">Global Guardians</a>. After the \"<a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\"> Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>,\" the international heroes still existed but could no longer be inspired by Batman and Robin. Instead, they took their inspiration from the <a href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\">Justice Society</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The earliest of these heroes was Percy Sheldrake, the young English man destined to become the Earl of Wordenshire. His father had been killed in North Africa in 1940. Just before his twentieth birthday in 1942, he and his mother moved from Wordenshire village to London, arriving amidst the Germans' bombing raids. Percy was rescued by the <a href=\"/shining-knight/4005-6890/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6890\">Shining Knight</a>, but his mother perished. Percy began working under the Shining Knight, who kept him safe.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Eventually, Percy donned a chain mail armor and red bandana mask to become the Squire. In 1942, he joined three other young heroes to form the <a href=\"/the-allies/4060-42931/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42931\">Allies</a>. The Allies accompanied the <a href=\"/young-all-stars/4060-41754/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41754\">Young All-Stars</a> on a \"morale-building\" tour of the U.S. One of the All-Stars, the Tigress, became enamored with the young Englishman. Cyril brushed away her advances, revealing that he had a wife and young son, Cyril, back in Britain. Riding astride the Shining Knight's flying horse, <a href=\"/winged-victory/4005-6897/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6897\">Winged Victory</a>, the Squire fought off an attack by agents of <a href=\"/axis-amerika/4060-50511/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50511\">Axis Amerika</a>, but was too late to save the Tigress' life.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the wake of the final battle, the Squire prepared to return to England (#26). However, first he joined Shining Knight and the <a href=\"/seven-soldiers-of-victory/4060-21145/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-21145\">Seven Soldiers of Victory</a> in their battle with the Skull.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At about the same time, the Justice Society embarked on a goodwill mission to Europe to deliver \"food to starving patriots.\" Later, during the early 1950s, several recipients of the JSA's kindness became some of the first real costumed heroes to emerge outside of the United States. They included:</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>The Legionary</b>, who had been a young anti-fascist Italian in the early 1940s</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>The Knight and Squire</b></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>The Gaucho</b>, who, though an Argentinean, had spied for the Allies inside Nazi Germany itself</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>The Musketeer</b>, a member of the French Resistance, at home with either sword or firearms</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>The Wingman</b>, who, born in neutral Sweden, had fought as a youth with the Norwegian Underground,</p><h2>The Global Guardians</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 1957, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/metahuman/4015-55705/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55705\">metahuman</a> immortal known as <b><a href=\"/doctor-mist/4005-26066/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26066\">Doctor Mist</a> </b>urged these six heroes to create \"a supra-national organization code-named <b>the Dome</b>.\" Headquartered in a mansion in Paris, all but Gaucho (who returned to <a href=\"/buenos-aires/4020-57371/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57371\">Buenos Aires</a>) agreed to join. As the years passed, more internationally known heroes joined. Eventually the team took the name Global Guardians. At least two original Dome operatives remained active. The Legionary took part in a Global Guardians investigation of a pharmaceutical company's role in the resurrection of Agent Axis. The second Squire (now Sir Cyril, Earl of Wordenshire) became a British spymaster.</p><h2>The Club of Heroes (Current)</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the current continuity, of New Earth, the timeline and origins of these heroes is uncertain. Once again, they all now say that Batman inspired them. It is <i>possible </i>that some of these heroes were involved with the foundation of the Dome (and thus, the Global Guardians). This would push the Dome's formation into recent decades, not the 1950s.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Even at the dawn of his career, Batman inspired non-powered men across the world to don disguises and fight crime. Within these first years, he was invited by the billionaire John Mayhew to join his admirers in the <i>\"Club of Heroes.\"</i> Mayhew was a mega-rich daredevil who spent his days in a manner much like Howard Hughes. Mayhew constructed a 20 billion dollar headquarters for the Club, which never really got off the ground. The Club's original members included: the Knight of England; the Native American <a href=\"/chief-man-of-bats/4005-51115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51115\">Man-of-Bats</a> and his son, <a href=\"/raven-red/4005-51116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51116\">Little Raven</a>; the Wingman of Sweden (who debuted a year<i> before</i> Batman); the Swordsman of France; the Ranger from Australia; Gaucho of Argentina; and the Legionary of Italy. </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During an early original meeting, the Knight left his son, (the Squire, Cyril Sheldrake) in the lobby of Mayhew Int'l, while he went in to a Club meeting. Cyril overheard his father tell them that the Batman would not be joining them. After this, the Knight began fighting with Mayhew, accusing him of killing some woman. The Squire burst in on the meeting to protect his father, but the real damage had already been done. After this incident, the Knight lost much of his nerve. The \"<i>English Batman</i>\" was ultimately killed by his archenemy,<b> Springheeled Jack.</b> Cyril succeeded him, becoming the<b> Knight</b> II. </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At some point, Cyril took on his own Squire (III), a girl named Beryl Hutchinson. They joined the new <a href=\"/international-ultramarine-corps/4060-48647/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48647\">Ultramarine Corps</a> of Superbia. This group was similarly ill fated. After failing to defeat an entity called the Black Death, they were sent by the JLA on a mission into the infant universe of Qwewq.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Years after its members had gone their own way, Mayhew invited the Club of Heroes back together for a reunion. Over the years, the Ranger had renamed himself Dark Ranger and Little Raven had grown to become Red Raven. The Swordsman had done time in prison. The Legionary had become corrupted and fell to his nemesis, <a href=\"/charlie-caligula/4005-55214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55214\">Caligula</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Once Batman and Robin arrived, a mysterious villain called the <a href=\"/black-glove/4060-54825/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54825\">Black Glove</a> appeared on a video screen and claimed to have killed Mayhew. The Legionary soon became the first Club member to fall prey to the Black Glove. He was murdered with knives, like his Roman forebear, Caesar. The Glove blew up Batman's transport and the Club was left to solve the murders and stay alive.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the investigation, Wingman bristled at Batman's presumption of leadership. He reminded everyone that he'd debuted a year before the Dark Knight. The Black Glove continued his thematic attacks, designed specifically for each member. Gaucho encountered weapons like those of enemies', <a href=\"/scorpiana/4005-55215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55215\">Scorpiana</a> or <a href=\"/el-sombrero/4005-55216/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55216\">El Sombrero</a>. Batman deduced the person behind the attacks was likely someone who had the most to lose when the Club of Heroes failed. Perhaps this man was trying his hand at a \"Club of Villains\"? </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The next body they found appeared to belong to the Wingman. However, Batman's deductive instincts were dead on: the Wingman was too good to have fallen so easily. He soon coaxed the Wingman out—he'd killed the Dark Ranger and was impersonating him. Wingman admitted to having allied with the Black Glove. He protested that the Club had been his \"big break\" and it was ruined by the Knight's accusations.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile, the younger heroes found Mayhew disguised as \"El Sombrero.\" Mayhew killed Wingman just after he revealed that Mayhew had indeed gotten away with killing his ex-wife years ago. Mayhew attempted to flee by plane, but was stopped by Batman. Mayhew parachuted back to his island and was apparently destroyed by his own bombs.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They have recently approached <a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Tim Drake,</a> asking to be part of the Network in Batman's absence.</p><p> </p><h2>Batman R.I.P.</h2><p> </p><p>The group came to Batman's assistance during the assault on Gotham by Doctor Hurt and his group during the R.I.P. story arc. The group included Knight, Squire, Dark Ranger, El Gaucho, Musketeer, Man of Bats and Red Raven. </p><h3> </h3><h2> </h2>",

It was believed that he was chosen by the great Wotan himself to lead all mice into a time of peace. However, this peace would not last. The Templar became divided over their loyalty towards soon-to-be-King Icarus, culminating in a horrendous battle on the Field of Avalon under the great tree Kros Cur Onnor Da. The Templar was destroyed, Icarus ascended to the throne and the history of the Templar was hidden behind myth.</p><p>There are still mice who follow the ways of the Templar, protecting what little peace is left and keeping their ways a secret.</p>",

They had a god or goddess for everything imaginable just to be sure that they were honoring, worshiping, or giving homage to all the right gods. The entire collection of their gods and goddesses was called the Roman Pantheon. As Rome grew into a city and began to become more powerful it came in contact with the Greeks, who had a complex Pantheon of their own.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Romans identified with Greek Mythology as most are analogues of Greek gods pantheon.These Roman gods and goddesses were counterparts which integrated Greek myths, iconography, cultural traits, and religious practices into Roman culture. The Roman pantheon deities carried similarities to human characteristics. The difference in each culture’s mythology is practically on how the people interpret them and how they picture their lives. Many of the Roman deities were named after the stars or planets, however the Greek deities were not. The Romans would adapt these into Latin literature, Roman art, and religious life throughout the Empire. The Romans also worshiped the roman Deities on both individual and communal levels. An individual would be a family that would pray at home for more food. At the communal level was when a group of people, most of the time the citizens of a town, would go and meet for a communal celebration or festival.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Roman Pantheon also included archaic deities thought to be inherited from other sources, most commonly Etruscan deities. Deities with obscure origins are thought to have been inherited from the Latin and Sabine ancestors of the Romans, or from other Italic tribes.

Although the Greek Pantheon has been a more popular draw into mainstream comics genera, The Roman Pantheon has been an inspiration in several comic titles throughout the years. Each character published with their names have taken the various traits and dispositions of the mythological Deities from ancient history. Here are a few of the characters which have been developed as a representation of the Roman God and Goddesses in many publishes companies such as Marvel, DC Comics among various mentions and descriptions in graphic novels.</p><h3>Habitat</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Habitat:</b> Earth-like</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Gravity:</b> Normal</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Atmosphere:</b> Normal</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Population:</b> 2000 (estimated)</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Type of Government:</b> Monarchy</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Level of Technology:</b> Magic</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3>Powers and Abilities</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Roman gods and goddesses all possess certain superhuman physical attributes as is notable of other Pantheon depicted in Marvel comics publications, as are the Asgardians, Olympians and so forth. They are true immortals who cease to age upon reaching adulthood, and they cannot die by conventional means. The Romans Deities flesh and bone are about three times denser than similar human tissue, contributing to the gods' superhuman strength and weight. An average male god can life about 30 tons; an average goddess can life about 25 tons. The gods' metabolism gives them superhuman endurance in all physical activities. All Roman Deities are functionally immortal. They are immune to the effects of aging and haven't aged since reaching adulthood. Their bodies are also immune to all known Earthly diseases and infection. Many of the Roman deities have also developed and possess additional superhuman powers.</p><h3>Essential Story-lines</h3><h4><b>DC Comics</b></h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-5052135\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5052135-gods_of_rome_01.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.98654708520179\" data-width=\"446\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 446px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5052135-gods_of_rome_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5052135\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5052135-gods_of_rome_01.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5052135-gods_of_rome_01.png 446w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5052135-gods_of_rome_01.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5052135-gods_of_rome_01.png 446w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In the DC universe the Roman gods have been depicted in the Captain Marvel/Shazam mythology, however DC Comics has also put a stronger role on the Greek pantheon which play a prominent role in the <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> history and story lines.

This is literally translated as \"Masked Army\".</p><p> </p><h2>Members</h2><p>The membership of the Visored is primarily made up of former captains and lieutenants of the Gotei 13 in the Soul Society. After hey had been infected by the process of Hollowfication, the Soul Society was going to execute them. They remained mostly in hiding for nearly a century.</p><h3>Shinji Hirako</h3><p><a href=\"/shinji-hirako/4005-54764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54764\">Shinji Hirako </a>was the former captain of the 5th Division in the Gotei 13. He became the de-facto leader of the Visored. He was the first person to approach Ichigo Kurosaki to join their ranks, but his authority is frequently challenged by Hiyori. His hatred of Sousuke Aizen seems the deepest becasue he had never trusted him from the moment they met.</p><h3>Hiyori Sarugaki</h3><p><a href=\"/hiyori-sarugaki/4005-54804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54804\">Hiyori Sarugaki </a>was the former lieutenant of the 12th Division in the Gotei 13. Though Shinji is the unofficial leader, she often challenges his authority. This relationship hasn't changed since their time in the Soul Society, and they have always been at odds. Though this tension is antagonistic, it comes from a place of tense friendship. Hiyori has just always had an aggressive personality and challenges those she doesn't deeply respect.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>The Visored were all rescued from execution by <a href=\"/kisuke-urahara/4005-43021/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43021\">Kisuke Urahara</a> and <a href=\"/yoruichi-shihouin/4005-47126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47126\">Yoruichi Shihouin</a>, and they taken to Karakura Town on Earth and trained to control these powers. Urahara would later explain that they were saved through a special process he had created just for them using specially made gigai bodies and the essence of <a href=\"/quincy/4060-59703/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59703\">Quincy</a> light-arrows to prevent the Hollowfication side effect known as \"Soul Suicide\".</p><p>While this saved their lives, they still required deep training to tame the Hollow they had been infected by.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Turn Back the Pendulum Arc</h3><h3>Arrancar Arc</h3><h3>Fake Karakura Town Arc</h3><h3>The Lost Substitute Shinigami Arc</h3><h3>The Thousand-Year Blood War Arc</h3>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin  </h2><p>Desert Sword was designed to be Iraq's personal superhuman military team led by Sirocco. The original team's roster was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28529\" href=\"/sirocco/4005-28529/\" slug=\"sirocco\">Sirocco</a>,<a data-ref-id=\"4005-14908\" href=\"/aminedi/4005-14908/\" slug=\"aminedi\"> Aminedi</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14910\" href=\"/the-veil/4005-14910/\" slug=\"the-veil\">Veil</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14911\" href=\"/black-raazer/4005-14911/\" slug=\"black-raazer\">Black Raazer</a>, until Iraq forced <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14909\" href=\"/arabian-knight/4005-14909/\" slug=\"arabian-knight\">Arabian Knight</a> onto the team. Arabian Knight however was a double agent working with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-20605\" href=\"/pantheon/4060-20605/\" slug=\"pantheon\">Pantheon</a>. Desert Sword's first recorded mission was to prevent the U.S. sanctioned super team <a data-ref-id=\"4060-24132\" href=\"/freedom-force/4060-24132/\" slug=\"freedom-force\">Freedom Force</a> from liberating a German scientist named Reinhold Kurtzmann in Kuwait. </p> <p>They arrived before Freedom Force and managed to secure Kurtzmann. Achieving their goal they waited for Freedom Force and ambushed them. In the battle that followed Aminedi managed to decapitate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14907\" href=\"/super-sabre/4005-14907/\" slug=\"super-sabre\">Super Sabre</a> and cut off <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14906\" href=\"/crimson-commando/4005-14906/\" slug=\"crimson-commando\">Crimson Commando</a>'s right arm before Freedom Force managed to capture Kurtzmann and retreating. Desert Sword managed to recapture the German scientist, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3554\" href=\"/pyro/4005-3554/\" slug=\"pyro\">Pyro</a> killed him before he could give the Iraqis nuclear weapon capability. Enraged at their mission's failure the team pressed the assault against the American heroes causing<a data-ref-id=\"4005-3553\" href=\"/avalanche/4005-3553/\" slug=\"avalanche\"> Avalanche</a> and the Crimson Commando to become trapped in a minefield. </p> <p>During the skirmish Pyro managed to kill the Veil and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3182\" href=\"/blob/4005-3182/\" slug=\"blob\">Blob</a> was stabbed several times by the Arabian Knight and Black Raazer. Desperate and hurt, Blob turned the tide of the battle and managed to wound Arabian Knight with his own sword. As Avalanche and Crimson Commando lay in the minefield it became apparent that the Commando's condition was getting worse. Finally making a decision Avalanche managed to take the Commando to their designated extraction point and get him to safety, leaving both Blob and Pyro who were later captured by Desert Sword.</p> <p>Held as prisoners, Blob and Pyro were forced to serve as bodyguards for Iraq's military elite until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1470\" href=\"/toad/4005-1470/\" slug=\"toad\">Toad</a> came and freed them in order to have them join the new <a data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\" href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/4060-17652/\" slug=\"brotherhood-of-evil-mutants\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>. It was later revealed that Aminedi was killed by the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42281\" href=\"/legacy-virus/4015-42281/\" slug=\"legacy-virus\">Legacy Virus</a>. The Arabian Knight's wounds healed and he went on to battle the U.S. chemically altered soldier codenamed Sandstorm and opposed fellow Pantheon members over an issue of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. Arabian Knight was later apparently killed by a powerful mutant named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-34526\" href=\"/humus-sapien/4005-34526/\" slug=\"humus-sapien\">Humus Sapien</a>. Black Raazer and Sirocco are the only active members left alive.  </p><h2>Creation</h2>Desert Sword is a <a data-ref-id=\"4010-31\" href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" slug=\"marvel\">Marvel comics</a> book team, created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41350\" href=\"/fabian-nicieza/4040-41350/\" slug=\"fabian-nicieza\">Fabian Nicieza</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25909\" href=\"/kirk-jarvinen/4040-25909/\" slug=\"kirk-jarvinen\">Kirk Jarvinen.</a> They first appear in New Mutants Annual #7, although they remain unidentified until Uncanny X-Men Annual #15, both issues released in 1991. ",

Their primary purpose was to guard the Medallion of power and keep it from being like Zarathos, Who sought to use the Medallion for their own purposes .</p><p>When Zarathos succeeded in temorarily gaining possession of the Medallion, The Blood united with the Spirits of Vengeance and mounted a last-ditch effort to retrieve the Medallion. During the battle the Spirits of Vengeance where trapped along side Zarathos in the Medallion of Power. The Medallion became so powerful that no one individual cocould be entrusted with it, The Blood decided to brake the Medallion in to pieces and place bound them to the souls of two human families. One of the eldist members of the Blood was given the ask of watching over the two families, he was named the Caretaker.</p><p>After these avents the Blood started to splinter and go their separate ways, some begain to worship Zarathos, they became known as the Fallen. Some went into hiding in the most remote parts in the world and would only come out when called these where known as the Hidden. the remaining members of the Blood apointed Regent as their new leader.</p><p><strong>ZARATHOS RETURNS</strong></p><p>After Lilith and her children revived Zarathos, the Blood once more came back together but they could not beat the combind forces of Zarathos and his followers, so like they did all those years a go they allided themselves with The Spirits of Vengeance but this time it came in the form of Ghost Rider [Dan Ketch] who was also part of a team intent on stoping Zarathos, The Midnight Sons.</p><p>They manged to defeat Zarathos and the Fallen but it came at a cost, many of the Blood had died including two of the eldest members Embyree and Raydar.

    "description": "<p>The nymphs of Greco-Roman mythology are typically depicted as beautiful, young maidens of marriageable age. The term nymph literally means \"bride\". They are usually subdivided into categories by dwelling and association. For example Oreads (nymphs of the mountains), Dryads (nymphs of the trees), Naiads (nymphs of fresh water). The Nereids and Oceanids, feminine nature spirits of the seas, derive from similar concepts and might also be called nymphs.</p><p>There are several legends of nymphs mating with gods and mortals, giving birth to notable offspring. Others simply depict them as companions to major deities, such as Artemis.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The People's Heroes were a group of superhuman agents created by Communist scientists using information learned through scientific analysis of the American super team, The <a href=\"/force-of-july/4060-47155/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47155\">Force of July</a> who they captured and analyzed. They are assigned to the Soviet secret service. They battled <a href=\"/outsiders/4060-5704/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5704\">The Outsiders</a> twice and each team had a winning battle against each other. The People's Heroes later came into conflict with the <a href=\"/suicide-squad/4060-40394/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40394\">Suicide Squad</a> during a kidnapping mission. The Squad squarely defeated the Heroes, leaving Pravda for dead.</p><p>After a failed attempt by Hammer and Sickle to execute <a href=\"/red-star/4005-3581/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3581\">Red Star</a> - another Russian hero - on behalf of an extreme faction of the Russian government, the People's Heroes were disbanded. However, Molotov and Bolshoi were recruited by the <a href=\"/red-shadows/4060-47077/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47077\">Red Shadows</a>, the Russian counterpart of the Suicide Squad.</p><p>The Suicide Squad made up of core members, <a href=\"/bronze-tiger/4005-23535/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23535\">Bronze Tiger</a>, <a href=\"/nightshade/4005-4881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4881\">NIghtshade</a>, <a href=\"/deadshot/4005-5763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5763\">Deadshot</a>, and <a href=\"/captain-boomerang/4005-29992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29992\">Captain Boomerang</a> broke into a Russian prison based on bad Intel to retrieve<a href=\"/rick-flag/4005-39769/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-39769\"> Rick Flag </a>. This information was found to be incorrect. It was a trap for the Squad and they faced The Peoples Heroes, a second time, along with Stalnoivolk. Captain Boomerang sliced Bolshoi's tips of his right fingers off with a steel boomerang which lodged into his abdomen. Deadshot used incendiary explosives on Molotov, Nightshade took Pravda into her shadow realm, and Bronze Tiger disabled Stalnoivolk by disrupting his equilibrium with a punch. The Squad left realizing there was no Rick Flag.</p>",

They possess a form of telepathy that allows them to know what the other is doing and how they will act.</p><p>Gunmen were hired to kill enemies of enslaved Mayans. Their mission in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\" href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\">New York</a> was interrupted by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-25321\" href=\"/cyberforce/4060-25321/\">Cyberforce</a>, and one of the brothers was killed. The cause is something they are willing to die for, and they knew that Cyberforce's intentions were good. The Gunmen then assisted <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41824\" href=\"/ballistic/4005-41824/\">Ballistic</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21923\" href=\"/stryker/4005-21923/\">Stryker</a> to find info on <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56147\" href=\"/mekadom/4060-56147/\">Mekadom</a>, they also helped them to destroy the Mekadom facility. The Gunmen then returned to their own mission.</p><h3>Keya' Su' Matra</h3><p>One form of Gunmen is Keya' Su' Matra, the Order of Silence. They are also known as Deathmen; like their gunmen counterparts they too use telepathy, but in addition they can transfer power from a dead member to other brothers. It's known that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21927\" href=\"/killrazor/4005-21927/\">Killrazor</a> was once Keya' Su' Matra, which means that he had two brothers, who now are possibly dead. Keya' Su' Matra however does not let their members to leave the order; so Killrazor was hunted down for leaving. The triplets who were sent after him were all killed by Killrazor.</p>",

The Avatar then began an attack on a European Space Agency where <a href=\"/captain-atom/4005-2050/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2050\">Captain Atom</a> attempted to stop him only to be caught himself. Captain Atom was kept in a crystal that contained his power which the Avatar needed to carry out his plans.

With the help of the new Peacemaker, <a href=\"/mitchell-black/4005-122745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-122745\">Mitchell Black</a>, they held the forces off before too much was lost. Meanwhile the <a href=\"/blue-beetle-kord/4005-2054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2054\">Blue Beetle</a> and the <a href=\"/vic-sage/4005-3211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3211\">Question</a> were near by investigating a group of the Avatar's followers and met up with the <a href=\"/judomaster/4005-18995/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18995\">Judomaster</a> who was looking to correct a wrong he committed. The trio were attacked by the Avatar's follower's and fled in the Blue Beetle's <a href=\"/the-bug/4055-41372/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41372\">Bug</a> this is when they were contacted by Sergeant Steel to meet him in the Alps. Upon their arrived at the Peacemaker Project base they learned <a href=\"/nightshade/4005-4881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4881\">Nightshade</a> was there as well recovering from a procedure to remove a succubus that had been inhabiting her.</p><p>When the Blue Beetle, the Question, Peacemaker and the Judomaster were defeated by the Avatar and his Ravanans, Judomaster was taken captive were he revealed the Avatar was non other than his former partner, <a href=\"/tiger/4005-33348/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33348\">Tiger</a>. Nightshade using her newly discovered powers she was able to locate and rescue the Justice League, who returned the favor by helping her fight off the the Ravanan's assault. The League returned to earth to clean up the remaining Ravanans while the Question, Blue Beetle, and Peacemaker ventured into space to shut down the Avatar's targeting system that he planed to use to destroy all military outlets on earth. Blue Beetle managed to shut it down before there was a major disaster, while Judomaster defeated Avatar and putting an end to his mission. The L.A.W. then freed Captain Atom and and they all went their own separate ways.</p>",

Most of the team died trying to defeat the villain, though most of them later turned up alive. The first wave of Fighters went straight fo Eclipso's stronghold and were all killed. A smaller team is sent into to recover the bodies and continue observing Elcipso's actions. Eclipso throws a nuclear missile at their headquarters and upon fleeing, the team regroups and is able to chase him out.</p><h2>Members</h2><ul><li>Amanda Waller - Supervisor</li><li><a href=\"/bruce-gordon/4005-3764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3764\">Bruce Gordon</a></li><li><a href=\"/cave-carson/4005-9321/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9321\">Cave Carson</a> - Injured and abandoned, but survived</li><li><a href=\"/chunk/4005-10473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10473\">Chunk</a></li><li><a href=\"/commander-steel/4005-23481/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23481\">Commander Steel</a> - KIA</li><li><a href=\"/creeper/4005-5713/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5713\">Creeper</a> - KIA, though he was later revealed to be alive.</li><li><a href=\"/doctor-midnight/4005-47757/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47757\">Doctor Midnight</a> - KIA</li><li><a href=\"/major-victory/4005-26868/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26868\">Major Victory</a> - KIA</li><li><a href=\"/manhunter/4005-2529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2529\">Manunter</a> - KIA, but discovered to have not been Mark Shaw.</li><li><a href=\"/mona-bennett/4005-12934/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12934\">Mona Bennet</a></li><li><a href=\"/nemesis/4005-9315/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9315\">Nemesis</a></li><li><a href=\"/nightshade/4005-4881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4881\">Nightshade</a></li><li><a href=\"/peacemaker/4005-14371/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14371\">Peacemaker</a> - KIA, though he was later revealed to be alive.</li><li><a href=\"/professor-bennett/4005-39149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-39149\">Professor Bennet</a></li><li>Rex the Wonder Dog</li><li><a href=\"/yolanda-montez/4005-47728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47728\">Wildcat</a> - KIA</li></ul>",

The <a href=\"/justice-league-international/4060-26208/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26208\"> JLI</a> had recently been granted United Nations sponsorship, the business leaders of America decided that they needed a team of super heroes to defend the interests of corporate America. The Conglomerate was the corporate representative's as a \"superhero team\" being the brain child of public relations specialist <a href=\"/claire-montgomery/4005-10127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10127\"> Claire Montgomery</a> as competition for the JLI, which was then run by her ex-husband <a href=\"/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10149\"> Maxwell Lord</a>. The Conglomerate has had several incarnations, the first led by the ex-Leaguer <a href=\"/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\"> Booster Gold</a>, and included <a href=\"/praxis/4005-10111/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10111\"> Praxis</a>, <a href=\"/maxi-man/4005-10208/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10208\"> Maxi Man</a> , Echo, <a href=\"/vapor/4005-10207/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10207\"> Vapor</a>, Reverb and also ex-Leaguer <a href=\"/gypsy/4005-10206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10206\"> Gypsy</a>. Companies providing sponsorship to the new team included American Steel, Dante Foods, Dupree Chemical, Ferris Aircraft,<a href=\"/lexcorp/4060-51472/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51472\"> LexCorp</a>, Ovel Oil, Pax Entertainment, <a href=\"/stagg-enterprises/4060-61159/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61159\">Stagg Industries</a>, <a href=\"/star-labs/4060-56686/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56686\"> S.T.A.R. Labs</a>.</p><p>Acting as field leader of this young team Booster Gold spent time shaping the group by performing tasks for the corporate sponsors before the team revolted and began performing truly heroic missions, such as defending the country from corporate pawns. <u> </u> This team initially is hostile towards the JLI, fueled by Booster Gold's recently quitting the group over his own perceived lack of respect from his peers. However given their mutual attitude towards justice the two groups gradually become friendly. Eventually all the members of this version of the Conglomerate disband and its unity drifts away. Booster Gold part ways with the team during an attack upon New York city by the mad alien mentalist, <a href=\"/despero/4005-9548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9548\"> Despero</a>. Claire doesn't want the team to go because she believes they will only get in the way. However Booster Gold believes he has enough experience with the League and leaves on his own.</p><p>However, the Conglomerate has an upcoming competition with the JLI, and Montgomery quickly recruits an all-<a href=\"/new-conglomerate/4060-41636/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41636\"> new Conglomerate</a>, thanks to the dimension-spanning powers of would-be member Norman the Doorman: Deadeye, Fiero, Frostbite, Elasti-Man, Element Man, Scarab, and Slipstream, inter dimensional heroes who later are revealed as villains from <a href=\"/qward/4020-41619/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41619\"> Qward</a>, however they are defeated by the teamwork of the JLI. Although this Qwardian team did not have an apparent name to their group, it can be assumed that they were another incarnation of the <a href=\"/crime-syndicate-of-amerika/4060-41531/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41531\"> Crime Syndicate of America</a>. The characters seemed to be douplegangers, or counterparts to League members such as <a href=\"/blue-beetle/4005-4438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4438\"> Blue Beetle</a>, <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\"> the Flash</a>, both <a href=\"/fire/4005-4439/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4439\"> Fire</a> and <a href=\"/ice/4005-2051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2051\"> Ice</a>, <a href=\"/metamorpho/4005-2384/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2384\"> Metamorpho</a>, the <a href=\"/green-arrow/4005-5936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\"> Green Arrow</a>, and finally the <a href=\"/elongated-man/4005-4437/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4437\"> Elongated Man</a>.</p><h2>The New Conglomerate</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60392/1432115-thenewconglomerate8.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1432115\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5547866205306\" data-width=\"867\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 867px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60392/1432115-thenewconglomerate8.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1432115\"><img alt=\"The New Conglomerate\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60392/1432115-thenewconglomerate8.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60392/1432115-thenewconglomerate8.png 867w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60392/1432115-thenewconglomerate8.png 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60392/1432115-thenewconglomerate8.png 411w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" data-width=\"411\"></a><figcaption>The New Conglomerate</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The last reinvention of the team is led by the British hero known as <a href=\"/templar/4005-58678/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58678\"> Templar</a>, and Al and Jesse features returning Conglomerate members <a href=\"/echo/4005-3601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3601\"> Echo </a>and <a href=\"/hardline/4005-10121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10121\"> Reverb</a> as well as more established heroes such as the former Infinity Inc member Nuklon, and also the once Titan Jessie Quick.

    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>The Heroes of Lallor first appeared in Adventure Comics #324 (1964) and aside from a story in which Beast Boy died (Adventure #339) and a smattering of appearances for Duplicate Boy as Shrinking Violet's boyfriend, they've been pretty much relegated to the role of cameos in group shots at fancy functions (like Legion marriages) or in the background in the more epic fights (like the Great Darkness Saga). Their origin tale was reprinted in Batman #238 (1972).</p><h2>History</h2><p>An accidental atomic explosion on the planet Lallor in the middle of the 30th Century affected the genes of five couples living near the site. Each of the five children born to these families possesses unique powers: </p><p><a href=\"/duplicate-boy/4005-37533/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37533\">Duplicate Boy</a> (Ord Quelu) can mimic any other individual's powers. He can duplicate different powers at the same time, as evidenced by shrinking himself to chase Shrinking Violet and then duplicating Superboy's heat vision to set fire to a bundle of sticks to scare off an animal trying to attack her.</p><p><a href=\"/beast-boy/4005-47265/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47265\"> Beast Boy</a> (Ilshu Nor) can change into animal forms.</p><p><a href=\"/life-lass/4005-37532/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37532\"> Life Lass</a> (Somi Gan) can animate inanimate objects; </p><p><a href=\"/gas-girl/4005-37531/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37531\"> Gas Girl</a> (Tal Nahil) can change into a sentient gas form; and </p><p><a href=\"/evolvo-lad/4005-12854/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12854\"> Evolvo Lad</a> (Sev Tcheru) can evolve into more advanced or more primitive forms. </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Exiled from Lallor by a dictator, the five went to Earth, where they were briefly tricked by a man named Doctor Marden King into battling the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\"> Legion of Super Heroes</a>, in attempt to seek vengeance for his brother <a href=\"/jungle-king/4005-32287/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32287\"> Jungle King</a>'s death. The five returned to their planet as heroes, and although Beast Boy died an outlaw, they have remained the principal champions of justice on Lallor. Duplicate Boy and <a href=\"/shrinking-violet/4005-12835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12835\"> Shrinking Violet</a> were romantically involved for a while.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">5 Years Later</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b> </b>All members did wind up appearing in the 5 Years Later era (five years later). Life Lass as a member of the United Planets militia, and then Lallor fell to the Khunds. Apparently under Khund control, the Heroes appeared in Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Post-Zero Hour</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Post-Zero Hour, a few of them showed up in the series Legionnaires. Beast Boy and Gas Girl, with the former Arm-Fall-Off Boy, and Splitter. However Evolvo-Lad was in another team called Workforce and was not part of the Heroes of Lallor in this continuum. </p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Threeboot</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Threeboot Legion books made use of Lallor, but only Evolvo-Lad was ever seen as of Brainiac 5's ally's.</p>",

The Legion of Super-Villains, who consisted of <a href=\"/cosmic-king/4005-3594/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3594\">Cosmic King</a>, <a href=\"/lightning-lord/4005-3592/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3592\">Lightning Lord</a> and <a href=\"/saturn-queen/4005-3593/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3593\">Saturn Queen</a>, freed Lex Luthor from his jail cell to speak to him. The Legion of Super-Villains members each told their history to Lex Luthor, and how they all come from the distant future where the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> have reached adulthood and continue to fight crime. They explain that they want to defeat Superman to humiliate their arch-foes, since Superman was a Legion member as Superboy. They trapped Superman in a <a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">kryptonite</a> shield and almost vanquished him if not for the intervention of the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> members, <a href=\"/lightning-lad/1253/\" data-ref-id=\"1253\">Lightning Man</a>, <a href=\"/cosmic-boy/1264/\" data-ref-id=\"1264\">Cosmic Man</a> and <a href=\"/saturn-girl/1273/\" data-ref-id=\"1273\">Saturn Woman</a>, who were adult versions of Lightning Lad, Cosmic Boy and Saturn Girl, respectively.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The next time the Legion of Super-Villains take another stance against their honorable counterparts was when they journeyed into the past to join the Legion of Super-Heroes when it was being run by <a href=\"/dynamo-boy/4005-47316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47316\">Dynamo-Boy</a>, a person who cheated his way on the team to expel every rightful member. Since they journeyed from the future, no one would be aware that the Legion of Super-Villains members were actually criminals, so they would be able to join the Legion of Super-Heroes without arousing suspicion. Under the guise of fighting crime, this new \"Legion\" actually committed it instead. The expelled, honorable members of the Legion of Super-Heroes returned and fought the Legion of Super-Villains, chasing them off back into the future.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Superman traveled to the very distant future, when the members of the Legion of Super-Heroes are adults and some are even married with children, the Legion of Super-Villains rear their criminal heads again with two new members: <a href=\"/beauty-blaze/4005-3600/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3600\">Beauty Blaze</a> and <a href=\"/echo/4005-47366/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47366\">Echo</a>. The two Legions fight, with the Legion of Super-Villains getting the upper hand but are stopped by the powers of the descendants of both <a href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\">Lex Luthor</a> and <a href=\"/mr-mxyzptlk/4005-27436/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27436\">Mr. Mxyzptlk</a>, who are, ironically, heroes in the future.</p><h3><b>Tarik the Mute's Legion of Super-Villains</b></h3><figure style=\"width: 241px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/340060-27591-tarik-the-mute.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340060\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.6887966804979\" data-width=\"241\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:268.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/340060-27591-tarik-the-mute.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340060\"><img alt=\"Tarik the Mute\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3664/340060-27591-tarik-the-mute.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/340060-27591-tarik-the-mute.jpg 241w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3664/340060-27591-tarik-the-mute.jpg 238w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px\" data-width=\"238\"></a><figcaption>Tarik the Mute</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Chronologically, the first Legion of Super-Villains was led by <a href=\"/tarik-the-mute/4005-47422/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47422\">Tarik the Mute</a>, a man who spoke through a robot. Tarik the Mute started a school to teach criminals how to hone their abilities and wanted the training guidebooks from the <a href=\"/legion-academy/4060-47210/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47210\">Legion Academy</a> to have the edge. Tarik the Mute was able to blackmail <a href=\"/colossal-boy/4005-1271/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1271\">Colossal Boy</a> by turning his parents into fragile glass. Holding them hostage, Tarik the Mute made Colossal Boy get the training guidebooks for his Legion of Super-Villains, who included some former Legion rejects like <a href=\"/ron-karr/4005-47287/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47287\">Ron-Karr</a>, <a href=\"/spider-girl/4005-12855/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12855\">Spider-Girl</a>, <a href=\"/radiation-roy/4005-31023/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31023\">Radiation Roy</a> and <a href=\"/nemesis-kid/4005-47358/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47358\">Nemesis Kid</a>, as well as the brother of <a href=\"/lightning-lad/4005-1253/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1253\">Lightning Lad</a>, <a href=\"/lightning-lord/4005-3592/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3592\">Lightning Lord</a>. Members of the Legion of Super-Heroes were able to infiltrate this evil school and stop Tarik the Mute from continuing his criminal endeavors. Superboy (in disguise), Chameleon Boy, and Legion trainees Chemical King and Timber Wolf comprised the team that infiltrated the school. For their efforts, Chemical King and Timber Wolf were granted full membership status with Legion.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Legion of Super-Villains have continued to commit crimes without the leadership of Tarik the Mute, due to his incarceration. New members, including <a href=\"/chameleon-chief/4005-31024/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31024\">Chameleon Chief</a> and <a href=\"/sun-emperor/4005-31026/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31026\">Sun Emperor</a>, who also had futuristic counterparts with the future Legion Super of Super-Villains, joined established members like Spider-Girl, Nemesis Kid, Radiation Roy and Lightning Lord. On one of their capers, the LSV attempted to sneak their way into the Legion of Super-Heroes' headquarters to plant a bomb that would destroy everything. Fortunately for the LSH, they figured out the ruse in time to prevent the bomb from exploding, sending the super villains back to jail.</p><h3><b>The Legion of Super-Villains' Greatest Triumph</b></h3><figure style=\"width: 385px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/449783-366363_174989_legion_of_super_hero_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-449783\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4077922077922\" data-width=\"385\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/449783-366363_174989_legion_of_super_hero_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-449783\"><img alt=\"Assault of a Legion\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" data-width=\"385\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/449783-366363_174989_legion_of_super_hero_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/449783-366363_174989_legion_of_super_hero_super.jpg 385w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Assault of a Legion\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/449783-366363_174989_legion_of_super_hero_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/449783-366363_174989_legion_of_super_hero_super.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" data-width=\"385\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Assault of a Legion</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Legion of Super-Villain's biggest triumph and most ambitious plan was to overtake the world of <a href=\"/orando/4020-57118/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57118\">Orando</a>, where the Legionnaire <a href=\"/projectra/6797//\" data-ref-id=\"6797\">Queen Projectra</a> rules, and send it to an alternate dimension, where they could rule the planet in isolation.

Eventually, a large brawl occurred between the two teams, which was the perfect diversion for Nemesis Kid to enact his plan of transporting Orando into an alternate dimension, which he did with the help of <a href=\"/zymyr/4005-51416/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51416\">Zymyr</a>'s technology.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The biggest impact that their attack on the Legion of Super-Heroes had was on the planet of Orando, when Nemesis Kid fought against Karate Kid and killed him. Queen Projectra, in a rage, snapped Nemesis Kid's neck as her brand of justice. The tides turned and the Legion of Super-Heroes were able to defeat the Legion of Super-Villains, especially without the leadership of Nemesis Kid. The remaining members of the Legion of Super-Villains were remanded to Takron-Galtos, a planet devoted to being a large-scale prison facility.</p><h3>Nemesis Lad's LSV Roster:</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The roster for the Legion of Super-Villains, under the leadership of Nemesis Kid, that tried to control Orando is as follows:</p><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/340112-36890-legion-of-super-vill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340112\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"0.935\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/340112-36890-legion-of-super-vill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340112\"><img alt=\"The Legion of Super-Villains, led by Nemesis Kid\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/340112-36890-legion-of-super-vill.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/340112-36890-legion-of-super-vill.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Legion of Super-Villains, led by Nemesis Kid\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/340112-36890-legion-of-super-vill.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/340112-36890-legion-of-super-vill.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Legion of Super-Villains, led by Nemesis Kid</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href=\"/nemesis-kid/4005-47358/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47358\">Nemesis Kid</a> -

It has been revealed that all along, this incarnation of the Legion were always from an alternate reality. In order for their alternate reality to become real, Saturn Queen, Cosmic King and Lightning Lord traveled to the past and kidnapped both <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> and <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>, raising them as their own children. They also killed off some influential superheroes, including <a href=\"/aquaman/4005-2357/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\">Aquaman</a>, <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a>, <a href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Barry Allen</a> and the <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\">Martian Manhunter</a>, so they would not face undue opposition. However, Batman and Superman eventually realized their predicament and fought against their 'parents'. The Legion of Super-Villains then recruited Beauty Blaze and Echo, working with <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/4005-40816/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\">Ra's al Ghul</a>, to stop Batman and Superman from disrupting their carefully plotted plans. However, Superman and Batman, along with some revived members of the Justice League of America, defeated the Legion of Super-Villains. Cosmic King, Saturn Queen and Lightning Lord were returned to their rightful time and place, where their version of the Legion of Super-Heroes (all adults) took them into custody.</p><h3>The Legion of Three Worlds</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Legion of Super-Villains have made a return during the events of <a href=\"/final-crisis/4045-51642/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-51642\">Final Crisis</a>. They have all been freed by <a href=\"/superman-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\">Superboy Prime</a>, where it is revealed that he is the actual inspiration for the formation of the Legion of Super-Villains, much like <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> was the inspiration for the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. They proceeded to destroy <a href=\"/takron-galtos/4020-56390/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56390\">Takron-Galtos</a>, the prison planet they were incarcerated on. Their goal was simple: the utter destruction of Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes. The genesis of this roster has spurned the Legion of Super-Heroes to seek out alternate reality versions of themselves to battle against the massive Legion of Super-Villains. The Legion of Super-Villains are given rings very similar to their heroic counterparts, but the ring bears an S that resembles the S on Superboy Prime's logo.</p><h3>Superboy Prime's LSV Roster</h3><p

    "deck": "The Saiyajin is one of the most powerful alien races in the Dragonball Universe. They are commonly known as Saiyans in  english.",
    "description": "<p>The Saiyans, also known as Saiyajins are a warrior race who shared Planet Plant with the Tsufurujins. Using their ability to transform at a full moon the Saiyajins over powered the Tsufurujins and gained control over the planet. The Saiyajins made one of them, named Vegeta, king of the planet and reanamed the planet as Planet Vegeta.</p><p>The Saiyajins soon went into business taking over other planets and selling them. Soon <a href=\"/freeza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Freeza</a>, an evil alien warrior, feared the Saiyjins potential and destroyed their home word killing their whole race except for four of them. The remaining four were <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a>, <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>, <a href=\"/raditz/4005-45986/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45986\">Raditz</a>, and <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a>. (There were also more survivors; four more Saiyajins named Turles, Paragus, Brloy, and <a href=\"/tarble/4005-58638/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58638\">Tarble</a>; and two Tsufurujins named Baby and Dr.Raichii).</p><p>Later on, Half-Saiyajins were born on Earth. <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> was the first but he was soon followed by <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Trunks</a> and then <a href=\"/goten/4005-40745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40745\">Goten</a>.</p><h2>Transformations</h2><p>Great Ape - Every Saiyan with a tail is capable of this transformation. When they look into the full moon they transform in a large ape like creature which drastically increases their strength and durability while losing all sense of self and becoming feral. Great Ape's typically can use an Energy Blast from the mouth as a means of ranged attack. Great Ape transformations increase a Saiyans power 10 times. Even so, half blooded Saiyans like Gohan can become a Great Ape, so long as they have a tail. With training or a high enough power level a Saiyan can maintain control of his Great Ape form like Vegeta showed during his battle with Goku on Earth.</p><p>Users - All full blooded Saiyans and <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a></p><p>Golden Great Ape - A Saiyan who has already become a Super Saiyan(see below) can become this golden variant of the Great Ape with enough access to a full moon. This form is much more powerful than a regular Great Ape and is comparable to a Great Ape going Super Saiyan. This form seems more difficult to control since Vegeta who can control his Great Ape form, failed to control and went feral when he change into this one.</p><p>Users - <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a> and <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a></p><p><a href=\"/super-saiyan/4015-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55690\">Super Saiyan</a> - A form only acheivable when a Saiyan of significant power experinces a fit of extreme rage and has a direct need to take this transformation. Super Saiyans have r little physical change except for the blue eyes, blond hair, and yellow aura but the strength difference is enormous. Super Saiyans after transformed go through a personaliy change as well. Goku who normally enjoys fights with strong opponents even if they are evil becomes and avenging warrior hell bent on his enemies defeat. Vegeta when he first transformed became even more arrogant and prideful than before. With a desire to test his strength against strong adversaries.</p><p>Users - <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a>, <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>, <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>, <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Future Trunks</a>, Broly, <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Trunks</a>, <a href=\"/goten/4005-40745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40745\">Goten</a>, <a href=\"/bardock/4005-41189/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41189\">Bardock</a></p><p>Super Saiyan 2 - A Super Saiyan that has gone beyond, Super Saiyan 2's are incredibly powerful and have pushed the limits of their potential. Gohan was the first person to achieve this form. In this state the hair becomes spikier and the yellow aura gains an electrical effect. Super Saiyan 2 is believed to have double the power of the previous transformation.</p><p>Users - <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>, <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a>, <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>, <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Future Trunks</a>(video game only)</p><p>Super Saiyan 3 - This form is achievable only through extreme training and the final form in the manga, Super Saiyan 3 has some noticeable differences from the previous forms. While the electric aura and spike blonde hair remain, the hairs length increases to be about waist to knee length. The form increases the power output of the Saiyan to unbelievably high levels. This form is rarely matched and even more rarely beaten.</p><p>Users - <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a>, <a href=\"/gotenks/4005-51122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51122\">Gotenks</a>, <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>(video game only, Broly(video game only), <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Future Trunks</a>(video game only)</p><p>Super Saiyan 4 - An anime only transformation. The form is radically different from any previous transformation. Super Saiyan 4's gain Red colored fur over most of their body and their hair length become longer, but is more akin to their standard hair and they keep their natural dark color. The Saiyan in question keeps their electric yellow aura. This form seems to be a mix of the Great Ape transformation and the Super Saiyan aura.

To be prepare the growing roster of the Legion for what challenges may lay ahead, the <a href=\"../../united-planets/65-56731/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> United Planets </a>agreed to fund the Academy.

The Academy was later moved to Old Montauk Point, not far from <a href=\"../../metropolis/34-41184/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Metropolis</a>. The location allows a safe haven for the students and the faculty. The tower and adjacent center contain classrooms, training rooms, a library, mess hall, labs, and housing for the students and faculty. Several Legion Academy students eventually became Legionnaires.

The Academy has also trained newly appointed Legionaries such as the new <a href=\"../../jacques-foccart/29-26646/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Invisible Kid</a> and the mystic <a href=\"../../black-witch/29-30998/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> White Witch</a> in how to better use their abilities in a group setting.</p><p> </p><p>The Academy is overseen by Legion´s reserve-members <a href=\"../../bouncing-boy/29-21506/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bouncing Boy</a> and <a href=\"../../triplicate-girl/29-1262/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Duo Damsel</a>, who instruct the young students. <a href=\"../../wildfire/29-3621/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Wildfire </a>is a regular instructor, and a supporter of the Academy, often arguing the point that future Legionnaires should be recruited directly and only from the school.

As such, any world could send candidates for training.

They were escorted to the Academy's headquarters Warnabros by Legionnaires Apparition and Andromeda. When Legion membership was made voluntary, and Legionnaires were no longer appointed by their homeworlds, the United Planets closed the Academy. This made recruitment a challenge, and several Legionnaires mentioned perhaps they should begin their own Academy. Cannus returned to apply for Legion membership but didn't make the cut.</p><p> </p><p>Quite a while later, they made good and established the Legion Cadet Program. Among these cadets were Polar Boy<b>, </b>Comet Queen, <a href=\"/babbage/4005-52160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52160\"> Babbage</a>, <a href=\"/retro/4005-52158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52158\"> Retro</a><b> </b>and<a href=\"/amp-girl/4005-52157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52157\"> Amp Girl</a>.

    "deck": "Dr. Reginald Hargreeves adopted seven special children and formed the Umbrella Academy.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Umbrella Academy is composted of seven 'special' children born randomly from mothers who had shown no signs of pregnancy. They were raised by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47213\" href=\"/monocle/4005-47213/\" slug=\"monocle\">Reginald Hargreeves</a> for the sole purpose of saving the world from a threat he never named.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Umbrella Academy was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-44898\" href=\"/gerard-way/4040-44898/\" slug=\"gerard-way\">Gerard Way</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-44899\" href=\"/gabriel-ba/4040-44899/\" slug=\"gabriel-ba\">Gabriel Bá</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Apocalypse Suite</h3><p>On the same day a wrestler defeated a space alien, forty-seven special children were born from mothers who had shown no sign of pregnancy. All but seven died. These seven were rescued by Reginald Hargreeves, and trained in the use of their powers to save the world.</p><p>The children made their first public appearance at age ten when the Eiffle Tower gained sentience and began destroying Paris. Rumor cleared the civilians away and they soon discovered that, as Spaceboy suspected, that Robot Zombie Gustav Eiffel was behind the tower attack. Kraken killing Gustav with a knife (which would become his signature weapon) caused the tower to launch into space. Spaceboy opined to Hargreeves that he too would one day like to travel to space.</p><p>Later, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-33077\" href=\"/john-f-kennedy/4005-33077/\" slug=\"john-f-kennedy\">President Kennedy</a> requested the Academy's help to stop the rampaging Lincoln Memorial. Reginald Hargreeves agreed, in exchange for nuclear missiles. The monument was eventually taken down by a giant, sculpted John Wilkes Booth that Rumor called into existence. [As seen in Dallas]</p><h3>Anywhere but Here</h3><p>As teenagers, Vanya and Kraken had a band called the Primm-8s. As usual, Kraken was quick to anger, and got them into trouble continuously. Hargreeves demanded that the band disband, but Vanya and Kraken refused. They went to perform one final time....but Kraken never showed up. He had gone to fight crime with his siblings. Vanya left the country heavy-hearted, wanting to be 'anywhere but here'.</p><h3>…But the Past Ain't Through With You</h3><p>Rumor died once. The Academy (with Rumor!) found her body, sawed in half, in an alley. Séance confirmed that it was Rumor by the psychic impressions. Not sure what was happening the Academy dropped the case to stop a rampaging sea-serpent that was upset because plushies were being made in its likeness. But that was not the end of the dead-Rumor. A villain called the Murder Magician took credit for her death on a talk show. The Academy showed up to stop him, destroying his murder-bot, and killing his assistant. Spaceboy explains what had happened: To get out of patrol duty, Rumor had said she was studying at the library. Since everything she said became truth, a duplicate Rumor was at the library. This duplicate was captured and killed by the Murder Magician.</p><h3>Apocalypse Suite, Continued</h3><p>For a time, the Academy split up. Until Reginald Hargreeves died.</p><p>Spaceboy heard the news from his moon-base. He had long ago accomplished his dream of going into space, though he had been badly injured in the process. Hargreeves saved him by attaching his head to a Martian gorilla body. Upon hearing the news of Hargreeve's death, Spaceboy goes back to Earth for the funeral. At the old mansion, he meets Rumor. Rumor had long since hung up the costume, and started a family. However, her husband had divorced her, and she felt lost.</p><p>Before the funeral, a surprise guest arrived: 00.05, the Boy had come back from the future, still ten years old, after 60 years of calculating how to travel back in time. There was going to be an Apocalypse, and he had to stop it. Still, this had to wait until after the funeral.</p><p>Meanwhile, Vanya Hargreeves found an invitation for a performance. She went to the Icarus theater, and the Conductor told her about his plans to destroy the world with the music he wrote. He just needed her to play it. Vanya left, disgusted.</p><p>As with most family events, the funeral ended in squabbling between Kraken and Spaceboy. This time, Spaceboy was going to finish Kraken for good. Only a fire on the horizon stopped him, and Kraken got away. Spaceboy, Rumor, and the Séance went to investigate. Several Terminauts were destroying a carnival. They had been programmed to attack if ever the Umbrella Academy reformed. Seeing the robots terrified Rumor, whose arm had once been devoured by the robots' creator, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-60417\" href=\"/doctor-terminal/4005-60417/\" slug=\"doctor-terminal\">Dr. Terminal</a>. She went into shock, and was not much help in rescuing the children from the blazing carnival. In another part of the carnival, Kraken was also helping. The chaos was such that no one noticed Vanya coming to meet her family again. Kraken, furious that she would show her face after all these years, drove her off. She returned to the Orchestra Verdammten.</p><p>Rumor, Séance, Spaceboy, and Kraken returned home. The Boy found Hargreeve's monocle, which allowed him to see things how they really were. He passed out from the strain of using it.</p><p>While the others were returning home, Vanya's powers were being unlocked by the Conductor. The powers Hargreeves had never told her about because they were too dangerous. Driven insane by the pain and the power, Vanya killed the Conductor with a note, and led an assault on the Umbrella Academy mansion. With a note, she sliced the statue of the deceased Horror in half. With another, she killed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47847\" href=\"/pogo/4005-47847/\" slug=\"pogo\">Pogo</a>. Then she left, inviting the team to see her at her recital.</p><p>No rest for the weary. Spaceboy immediately went out on patrol. Rumor asked the Séance if he would be going to sleep, but he replied that he would go as well...he had been eating speed and every time he closed his eyes he saw centipedes. Kraken also was preparing to take down Vanya.</p><p>Rumor, Spaceboy, 00.05, and Séance prepare. They send Séance off on a special mission and head to the Icarus Theater. Kraken was already there. Before Rumor could fight, Vanya, the White Violin, cut her throat with a note. Spaceboy rushed her to the hospital. 00.05 and Kraken held their ground against the murderous orchestra. Then, the Séance arrived, with a children's orchestra, a composer, and several Ubu tribe members. They played a melody to counteract the Apocalypse Suite while Séance, pretending to channel Hargreeves, took on Vanya. He distracted her, making her feel inadequate, and remorseful. Séance revealed to the others that he had just been acting, fairly gleeful. 00.05 put a bullet in Vanya's head. Before she passed out, she revealed that the music could not be stopped. The moon exploded.</p><p>The Séance caught the 40,000 ton piece of moon, saving the world. Rumor and Vanya both lived, though Rumor could not speak and Vanya could not move and was completely amnesiac. Returning home, the Academy discovered that the mansion had been crushed by the Eiffel Tower. No one was sad.</p><h3>Mon Dieu!</h3><p>During the brief lull, 00.05 tested a time-travel device on Séance, accidentally sending him into the middle of the French Revolution. He is returned home moments later, with a perfect knowledge of French.</p><h3>Dallas</h3><p>Several weeks after Vanya's plans had been thwarted, the Academy was much changed. Rumor was bitter and resentful, Spaceboy never left the TV and had grown fat. Séance was a celebrity, and 00.05 was in serious trouble. Only Kraken was as he had been.</p><p>Several members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56319\" href=\"/temps-aeternalis/4060-56319/\" slug=\"temps-aeternalis\">Temps Aeternalis</a> tried to kill 00.05. He defeated them handily but not before one of them managed to call for re-enforcement...<a data-ref-id=\"4005-60398\" href=\"/hazel/4005-60398/\" slug=\"hazel\">Hazel</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-60397\" href=\"/cha-cha/4005-60397/\" slug=\"cha-cha\">Cha-Cha</a>. Hearing this, 00.05 said they were all doomed.</p><p>Rumor wonders what is going on with 00.05, who had been acting strangely. She tracks him down and makes him tell her the full story.</p><p>00.05 had been captured by the Temps Aeternalis while returning to the past. They had altered him, splicing his DNA with that of famous killers, and training him. He eventually escaped them, and returned to the present, but they were hunting him. As they talked, 00.05 noticed a puppy at a pet store, and bought it.</p><p>As Rumor and 00.05 ate lunch, 00.05's commander caught up with them. He was an intelligent goldfish. And if 00.05 did not help kill President Kennedy, there would be consequences...the Temps Aeternalis had captured 00.05's mother before he was born. They also drew Rumor into the plot....since 00.05's mother was also Spaceboy's. They were twins.</p><p>00.05 and Rumor went with the Temp Aeternalis.</p><p>While Rumor was investigating, Hazel and Cha-Cha were on the hunt. They found Séance, who was drunk and high at Pogo's grave. Hitting him in the head with a baseball bat, they took him in for interrogation. Séance was trapped. He could not use his powers with shoes on, and Hazel and Cha-Cha had promptly put shoes on him. He managed to project his astral self through the TV, alerting Spaceboy that he needed help. Spaceboy set out to find him, but was too late...Hazel and Cha-Cha had killed Séance with a shot to the head...but not before obtaining Reginald Hargreeves' nukes.</p><p>Séance found himself in heaven, where he met God, who appeared as a giant cowboy. God didn't like him, and told Séance that Lucifer wouldn't either. So Séance was going back to Earth. Oh, and he needed to get revenge like a man.</p><p>Spaceboy arrives at the hideout only to find Séance's body. He is tazed by Hazel and Cha-Cha, shutting down his systems. All of a sudden, Hazel shoots Cha-Cha in the head. Then he shoots himself. Séance comes back to life, yelling to God if that was manly enough for him? Then he resets Spaceboy's systems, and tells him not to worry, he disarmed the nukes with help from a dead scientist.</p><p>Then, Séance dug up Pogo's grave. He had learned about 00.05's planned assassination of the president, and they were going to stop him. In Pogo's grave was a dead Temps Aeternalis agent. Séance used the chronometer to send himself, Spaceboy, and Kraken back in time. As soon as they left, the world blew up. Séance hadn't properly defused the nukes.</p><p>Séance had also miscalculated the time, sending them several years too early. Not knowing what to do, they head to Vietnam. Spaceboy goes into the jungle for some thinking, while Kraken leads a military squad. Séance raises some money and builds a televator.</p><p>It's time to stop 00.05. Séance collects Kraken and Spaceboy, and brings them to his strip club. He didn't want to run a strip club, but it was the only way to make enough money for the televator. He hands his child to his Vietnamese wife, and gives her his sunglasses. Then Spaceboy, Kraken, and Séance are off to Dallas.</p><p>They are a little late. They save 00.05 from the double-crossing Temps Aeternalis agents, but Rumor (disguised as Mrs. Kennedy) has told Kennedy that his head was going to explode. It does. The group heads back to the present. Spaceboy is furious that Rumor would kill just to save him. But when they return...everything is exactly the same. Except not exploded. By killing Kennedy, 00.05 ensured that Hargreeves would never get the nukes. His goldfish boss appears with ice cream. Fed up, 00.05 eats the goldfish. Séance says that was the straw that broke the camels back, and goes to a bar. Spaceboy goes back to the forest. Rumor makes peace with Vanya.</p><h2>Members</h2><p><b>Reginald Hargreeves</b> aka The Monocle: Reginald Hargreeves is an alien posing as a human.

Numerous \"normal\" clones were created by the project as well, including clones of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7644\" href=\"/guardian/4005-7644/\">Guardian</a> and the members of the Newsboy Legion. <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13699\" href=\"/the-hairies/4060-13699/\">The Hairies</a>, a group of intellectually advanced hippies were also created, but sequestered themselves away from the workings of Cadmus. A number of miniaturized monsters based upon horror films that Donovan liked were also created.</p><p>After the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\" href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a> the DNA Project's name was changed to Project Cadmus. During this time the Project created the new <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\" href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\">Superboy</a>, a clone created from the genetic material of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\">Superman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\" href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\">Lex Luthor</a>. He was rescued from the project by the original Newsboy Legion. Also at this time the Cadmus-created clone of the Guardian, called the Golden Guardian, worked as the head of Cadmus security, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12683\" href=\"/dubbilex/4005-12683/\">Dubbilex</a>, a DNAlien, was also a member of staff there. The Project came under the direction of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13661\" href=\"/paul-westfield/4005-13661/\">Paul Westfield</a>, who had an approximation of Superman's DNA created after the hero's death at the hands of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9989\" href=\"/doomsday/4005-9989/\">Doomsday</a>. Westfield sent a Guardian clone, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-69765\" href=\"/auron/4005-69765/\">Auron</a>, to take the sample from the Newsboy Legion, and Auron nearly killed the new Legion before his Guardian memories surfaced and he took the sample into space. This caused the Legion to seriously contemplate leaving the Project.</p><p>During <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55996\" href=\"/fall-of-metropolis/4045-55996/\">The Fall of Metropolis</a>, Cadmus was involved in fighting Lex Luthor, and many of their creations suffered from a \"clone plague\" leaving many clones sick or dying. After Westfield was killed by Donovan, now completely mad and allied with <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\" href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\">Apokolips</a>, Cadmus appeared to have been destroyed completely. In reality, however, the Project simply went underground to avoid notice and scrutiny. The Newsboys and their clones soon left the Project altogether, and it was put under new management, taken over by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17732\" href=\"/mickey-cannon/4005-17732/\">Mickey \"The Mechanic\" Cannon</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17723\" href=\"/serling-roquette/4005-17723/\">Dr Serling Roquette</a> joined the project as the head of genetics, and Donovan returned to the Project, though he was kept under guard. This new Cadmus again became more open to the public, though soon after it was taken over by the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55635\" href=\"/evil-factory/4045-55635/\">Evil Factory</a>, an opponent group run by followers of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\" href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\">Darkseid</a> that was revealed to be under the sway of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19250\" href=\"/the-agenda/4060-19250/\">The Agenda</a>. During this period the Project produced clones for The Agenda.</p><p>When Luthor became President he began to put pressure on the Project, which made the leaders of the Project uncomfortable. By the end of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10006\" href=\"/imperiex/4005-10006/\">Imperiex</a> War the project had disbanded altogether, and the underground factories were abandoned. In <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40798\" href=\"/52/4045-40798/\">52</a> it was revealed that Cadmus was still in existence, though its purpose and membership were unknown. During the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56194\" href=\"/countdown-to-final-crisis/4045-56194/\">Countdown</a>, Cadmus resurfaced, still headed by Cannon, seeks out the help of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3213\" href=\"/jimmy-olsen/4005-3213/\">Jimmy Olsen</a>. Both Roquette and Dubbilex were also revealed to have remained with Cadmus at this point. Jimmy leaves the project out of fear for the destructiveness of his new powers, but returns sometime later when he discovers that Cadmus was involved in creating <a data-ref-id=\"4005-35888\" href=\"/assassin/4005-35888/\">Codename: Assassin</a>. The Project has again been disbanded, and the facilities abandoned save for Dubbilex, who reveals that Cadmus assets have been turned over to the control of an alien-killing military project.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><p><b>All-Star Superman</b></p><p>The DNA P.R.O.J.E.C.T., run by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48963\" href=\"/leo-quintum/4005-48963/\">Dr Leo Quintum</a>, appears in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-18139\" href=\"/all-star-superman/4050-18139/\"><i>All-Star Superman</i></a>, with the purpose of creating a replacement Superman should anything happen to the original. In the process of this they create a serum that can give an ordinary human Superman-like powers. Taken by Jimmy Olsen, this serum creates a Doomsday-like creature that is able to defeat Superman, who has been exposed to black <a data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\" href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\">kryptonite</a>. This version of the Project also created <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8312\" href=\"/bizarro/4005-8312/\">Bizarro</a> worker drones, giants and nanonauts. It is implied that they have also created a functioning Superman clone.</p><p><b>Cadmus One Million</b></p><p>In the 853rd Century, Cadmus has control overt the latest Superboy, the millionth clone of the original. At the behest of Cadmus, Superboy goes in search of 20th Century DNA, later implied to be <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6578\" href=\"/lobo/4005-6578/\">Lobo</a>.</p><p><b>Earth-51</b></p><p>On Earth-51, Cadmus is related to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51483\" href=\"/brother-eye/4005-51483/\">Brother Eye</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48221\" href=\"/buddy-blank/4005-48221/\">Buddy Blank</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3608\" href=\"/kamandi/4005-3608/\">Kamandi</a>.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p><b>Justice League</b></p><p>Cadmus was a major villain in the third season of the <i>Justice League</i> animated series (first season of <i>Justice League Unlimited</i>). The version was a combination of the original Cadmus, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40521\" href=\"/checkmate/4060-40521/\">Checkmate</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40394\" href=\"/suicide-squad/4060-40394/\">Suicide Squad</a>. This version started as Project: Achilles in <i>Superman the Animated Series</i>, and was designed to defend Earth should Superman go rogue again. Their remit was soon expanded to cover the whole of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55928\" href=\"/justice-league/4060-55928/\">Justice League</a>. Major members of Cadmus included <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4920\" href=\"/amanda-waller/4005-4920/\">Amanda Waller</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23237\" href=\"/general-eiling/4005-23237/\">General Eiling</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3770\" href=\"/emil-hamilton/4005-3770/\">Professor Hamilton</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-35339\" href=\"/dr-moon/4005-35339/\">Dr Moon</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-29591\" href=\"/tala/4005-29591/\">Tala</a>. Major financial backing was provided by Lex Luthor. After Luthor attempted to take over the world by merging with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4684\" href=\"/brainiac/4005-4684/\">Brainiac</a>, Cadmus was disbanded.</p><p><b>Young Justice</b></p><p>Cadmus appeared in a number of episodes of <i>Young Justice</i>. It is run by seven people, identified collectively as \"The Light.\" The Cadmus facility shown is run by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8263\" href=\"/blockbuster/4005-8263/\">Mark Desmond</a>, who has a brainwashed Guardian and Dubbilex under his command. This version of Cadmus directs a number of villainous activities throughout the series.</p><p><b>Smallville</b></p><p>On <i>Smallville</i>, Cadmus appears as Cadmus Labs, a research facility purchased by Lex Luthor. The purchase was later revealed to be a trap for a woman who took the project from Lex in a hostile takeover, and she was instantly mired in financial and legal troubles. The Project appeared again in the tenth season, still a part of LuthorCorp and involved in the creation of clones of Lex. Lex's plan to create these clones to heal his wounds was foiled by his apparent death, however two clones, LX-15 and LX-3, adolescent and elderly versions respectively, were revealed to have been created. LX-15 was revealed to be a clone of both Lex and Clark Kent, and was clearly meant to be Superboy. He was taken in by the Kents.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>The New Wave was a <a title=\"Superhero\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero\" rel=\"nofollow\">superhero</a> team which was a <a title=\"Comic book\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book\" rel=\"nofollow\">comic book</a> published from 1986-1987 by <a title=\"Eclipse Comics\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Comics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eclipse Comics</a>. The team debuted in a preview included in the pages of two other Eclipse publications, <i><a title=\"The DNAgents\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DNAgents\" rel=\"nofollow\">The New DNAgents</a></i> #9 and <i><a title=\"Miracleman\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracleman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miracleman</a></i> #8, before having its own its own book. For the first eight issues, <i>The New Wave</i> was published bi-weekly as a 16-page book. However after issue 9 through the end of issue 13 the book became a full-sized monthly.</p><p>The comic series was co-created by writer <a title=\"Mindy Newell\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindy_Newell\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mindy Newell</a>. The initial art team included penciller <a title=\"Lee Weeks\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Weeks\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lee Weeks</a> and inker <a title=\"Ty Templeton\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Templeton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ty Templeton</a>. Issue #6 featured fill-in artist <a title=\"Erik Larsen\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Larsen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Erik Larsen</a>. Issue #13 was drawn by artist <a title=\"Eric Shanower\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Shanower\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eric Shanower</a>.</p><h2>History of Publication</h2><p>The first five issues of the series depicted the team's origin, and is set on a space station owned by a corporation headed by a CEO with plans for world domination. During the course of the story, the extraterrestrial Tachyon is teleported onto the station, by scientist James Holmes, with whom Tachyon bonds. Dot, a spy with the power to shrink, sneaks aboard the station on a government mission. Circus acrobat Polestar stows away after a romantic interlude with a space shuttle pilot, while Avalon, Holmes' teenage witch daughter, and her boyfriend, the <a title=\"Telekinetic\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telekinetic\" rel=\"nofollow\">telekinetically</a> powered Impulse, are brought there by the CEO to use as leverage against Holmes. Megabyte, one of the CEO's robot guards, switches sides and assists the others to foil the CEO's plot. After deciding to stay together as a team, issues 7 - 9 depicted the team traveling to the mystical realm of Avalon, during which the titular character's mother is revealed to be the <a title=\"Lady of the Lake\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_of_the_Lake\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lady of the Lake</a> of <a title=\"Arthurian legend\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthurian_legend\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arthurian legend</a>. Subsequent single issues focused on The Volunteers, a group of superhumans with ties to Dot, Polestar's life in the circus, a \"<a title=\"Very special issue\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_special_issue\" rel=\"nofollow\">very special issue</a>\" about teen pregnancy, and Tachyon's sense of alienation.</p><p>Following the cancellation of the regular book, <i>The New Wave</i> returned in a two-issue \"micro-series\" called <i>The New Wave versus The Volunteers</i>. The book was rendered in <a title=\"Anaglyph image\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_image\" rel=\"nofollow\">3-D</a> in addition to non-3D format.</p><p>Following the bankruptcy of <a title=\"Eclipse Comics\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Comics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eclipse Comics</a>, its properties were purchased by <a title=\"Todd McFarlane\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_McFarlane\" rel=\"nofollow\">Todd McFarlane</a>, including the rights to the New Wave characters. The supporting character Heap has been re-imagined as an antagonist to McFarlane's character, <a title=\"Spawn (comics)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(comics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spawn</a>.</p><h2>Members</h2><ul><li><b>Avalon</b> - The teenage daughter of the legendary superhero \"The Lady,\" Avalon is a powerful witch of Druidic ancestory.</li><li><b>Dot</b> - The diminutive freelance spy with the power to shrink herself and at this tiny stature could fly and fire bio-electric blasts.</li><li><b>Impulse</b> - Avalon's next door neighbor, also her love interest.

A mysterious group of adventurers and heroes gathered by their leader, <a href=\"/celebrand/4005-47423/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47423\">Celebrand</a>; they earned a legendary and interstellar reputation for their exploits and their good deeds .</p><p>Hearing of the Legion of Super-Heroes themselves, the Wanderers sent an invitation to meet on Asteroid 108 where the two groups became fast friends and they erected a monument in honor of an oath they made to each other; to always be allies if they fight in the name of the law. Shortly after their meeting, the Wanderers' spacecraft flew into an irradiated space cloud named the Nefar Nebula and its psychoactive radiation twisted their personalities, turning them into criminals and they went on a crime spree, culminating in stealing the Seven Stones of Alactos.</p><p>The Legion soon learned of the theft from the <a href=\"/science-police/4060-23409/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23409\">Science Police</a> and honoring their oath, the Legion hunted down each member of the Wanderers. <a href=\"/bouncing-boy/4005-21506/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21506\">Bouncing Boy</a> was able to defeat <a href=\"/dartalon/4005-47427/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47427\">Dartalg</a>, Celebrand and <a href=\"/psyche/4005-47425/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47425\">Psyche</a>; <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/4005-5945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\">Chameleon Boy</a> captured <a href=\"/aviax/4005-47424/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47424\">Ornitho</a>; <a href=\"/karate-kid/4005-1269/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1269\">Karate Kid</a> stopped <a href=\"/quantum-queen/4005-47426/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47426\">Quantum Queen</a>; and <a href=\"/superman/1807/\" data-ref-id=\"1807\">Superboy</a> rounding up both <a href=\"/re-animage/4005-47429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47429\">Immorto</a> and <a href=\"/elvar/4005-47428/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47428\">Elvo</a>. The Wanderers were remanded into the custody of the Science Police and the effects of the Nefar Nebula wore off after two weeks. Upon recovering, the Wanderers would return as steadfast friends and valiant allies to the Legion.</p><p>The Wanderers were invited to the marriage of <a href=\"/bouncing-boy/4005-21506/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21506\">Bouncing Boy</a> and <a href=\"/triplicate-girl/1262/\" data-ref-id=\"1262\">Duo Damsel.</a> They also assisted the Legion of Super-Heroes during the <a href=\"/great-darkness-saga/4045-40773/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40773\"><i>Great Darkness Saga</i></a>, when <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a> tried to conquer the universe. The Wanderers were also in attendance of the Legion's anniversary ceremony known as Founder's Day.</p><p>Several years later, the Wanderers vanished into the depths of space and despite attempts by many to find the stalwart band of heroes, even by the Legion of Super-Heroes; they all failed to locate the missing champions.</p><p>The Wanderers possessed a small group of permanent members which included:</p><ul><li><b>Celebrand:</b> The Leader of the Wanderers who also lacked any superhuman powers, he made up with a keen tactical mind and a skillful master of a ray gun.</li><li><b>Dartalg:</b> The youthful Dartalg is a master marksman with dart projectiles and carries a blowgun on his person along with specially modified darts including anesthetic, explosive, and poisonous ones.</li><li><b>Elvo:</b> A master swordsman who wielded his own energy blade.</li><li><b>Immorto:</b> The immortal member of the Wanderers due to a mysterious force within his body that instantly rejuvenates his body whenever he is killed.</li><li><b>Ornitho:</b> Born with a pair of feathered wings growing from his shoulder blades that enable him to fly and hover in midair, Ornitho also possesses the power to shapeshift his body into any known avian species.</li><li><b>Psyche:</b> The Mistress of Emotions who possesses powerful psychic powers that enables her to influence the emotions of others around her.</li><li><b>Quantum Queen:</b> Possessing the power of transform her body into any form of quantum radiation; she could fly at the speed of light and discharge intense energy bursts as well as become invulnerable when in her energy form.</li></ul><h3>Post-Crisis Wanderers</h3><p><b><i>\"Life After Death\"</i></b></p><p>It was ultimately discovered that the Wanderers were murdered in their own spacecraft by strange alien creatures and their bodies were subsequently discovered by <a href=\"/clonus/4005-53129/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53129\">Clonus</a>, a <a href=\"/the-controllers/4060-22708/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22708\">Controller</a> who had also been tracking these alien creatures.</p><p>Deciding to use the Wanderers to defeat this menace, Clonus cloned the deceased Wanderers, thus restoring them to life.

As a consequence, four of them chose to embrace a new identity to go with these changes with Immorto adopted the name of <a href=\"/re-animage/4005-47429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47429\">Re-Animage</a>; Dartlag became <a href=\"/dartalon/4005-47427/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47427\">Dartalon</a>; Ornitho assumed the identity of <a href=\"/aviax/4005-47424/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47424\">Aviax</a>; and Elvo took the name of <a href=\"/elvar/4005-47428/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47428\">Elvar</a>.</p><p>After a few adventures during this time, the Wanderers discovered that the creatures responsible for their deaths were actually the degenerated \"children\" of Clonus and an unfortunate byproduct of his earlier and flawed cloning process.</p><p>Successfully solving the mystery of their deaths, the Wanderers would become official agents for the United Planets for a time before solving the problem with Celebrand's failed clones.

Mekt also sought to subvert a number of Legionnaires to his band of rebels such as <a href=\"/karate-kid/4005-1269/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1269\">Karate Kid</a>, <a href=\"/starman-kallor/4005-1260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1260\">Star Boy</a>, <a href=\"/ultra-boy/4005-1267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1267\">Ultra Boy</a>, <a href=\"/mon-el/4005-21508/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21508\">Mon El</a>, and his sister <a href=\"/lightning-lass/4005-30997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\">Light Lass</a> whom he believed possessed a more militaristic and antagonistic attitude that was more suitable for warriors and soldiers in a coming war against the Dominators .</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38758/845756-sgleg_cv27.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-845756\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5209125475285\" data-width=\"526\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 526px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38758/845756-sgleg_cv27.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-845756\"><img alt=\"Dominator War!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38758/845756-sgleg_cv27.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38758/845756-sgleg_cv27.jpg 526w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38758/845756-sgleg_cv27.jpg 420w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dominator War!\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38758/845756-sgleg_cv27.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38758/845756-sgleg_cv27.jpg 526w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38758/845756-sgleg_cv27.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dominator War!</figcaption></figure><p>When the war broke out, the Wanderers were forced to ally themselves with their rivals, the Legion of Super-Heroes; often presenting a dissenting and hostile attitude towards the United Planets and a much more lethal approach to combat against the Dominators. The Dominator War abruptly came to a conclusion when <a href=\"/cosmic-boy/4005-1264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1264\">Cosmic Boy</a> sent Mon El to detonate a bomb that imploded the Dominator homeworld Elia, apparently sacrificing his life to destroy the Dominator threat once and for all.</p><p>In secret, the implosion bomb was a smokescreen for a <a href=\"/phantom-zone-projector/4055-42369/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42369\">Phantom Zone Projector</a> that literally cast the entire planet and its inhabitants into the ghostly otherdimension prison of the <a href=\"/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\">Phantom Zone</a>, trapping them along with Mon El. Only a number of core Legionnaires such as Cosmic Boy, <a href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5</a>, <a href=\"/phantom-girl/4005-1257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1257\">Phantom Girl</a>, and <a href=\"/dream-boy/4005-47413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47413\">Dream Boy</a> were aware of the deception.</p><p>The United Planets were horrified at this act of genocide and sought to apprehend Cosmic Boy and put him in trial for war crimes. Subsequently, evidence was discovered that led the United Planets to believe that Mekt Ranzz had actually formulated the idea of destroying the Dominator's homeworld and had secretly arranged for Jeyra Entinn to mentally implant the suggestion in Cosmic Boy. Unknown to all but a select few, this evidence was actually doctored by Brainiac 5 who had orchestrated events to have Mekt arrested as he was far too charismatic and a polarizing individual who would have forced a splintering of the Legion.</p><p>Upon news of Mekt's arrest, the drafted Legionnaires returned to the Legion while the remaining Wanderers promptly vanished, apparently having foreseen their \"betrayal\" at the hands of the United Planets and the Legion. Afterward, a few members wonder if the Wanderers have dedicated themselves to forming a \"Legion of Super-Villains\" and are preparing to retaliate against the Legion.</p><p> </p><h3>Legion of Three Worlds' New Wanderers</h3><p>At the end of the <a href=\"/final-crisis-legion-of-three-worlds/4045-56073/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56073\">Legion of Three Worlds</a> saga, were the three versions of the Legion (Original/Retroboot, post-Zero Hour/Earth-247 and threeboot/Earth Prime) meet to defeat <a href=\"/superboy-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\">Superboy Prime</a> and the <a href=\"/time-trapper/4005-25998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25998\">Time Trapper</a>, the post-Zero Hour Legionnaries choose to explore the timestream/multiverse in search of his own home, leaving behind members XS and Gates. They choose this moment to call themselves as the New Wanderers.</p><p> </p><h3>New 52: Captain Comet's Wanderers.</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2945327\" data-ratio=\"1.6245487364621\" data-width=\"831\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 831px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:162.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2945327\"><img alt=\"Captain Comet and the Wanderers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px\" data-width=\"393\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg 831w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg 590w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg 393w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Captain Comet and the Wanderers\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg 831w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg 590w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99801/2945327-wanderers_0.jpg 393w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px\" data-width=\"393\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Captain Comet and the Wanderers</figcaption></figure><p>A newer version of the Wanderers debuted when <a href=\"/captain-comet/4005-30559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30559\">Captain Comet</a> returned just in time to help Superman against the evil <a href=\"/vyndktvx/4005-86373/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86373\">Lord Vyndktvx</a>.

    "description": "<p>The Angelus Warriors are similar to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47569\" href=\"/darklings/4060-47569/\"> Darklings</a> created by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24347\" href=\"/the-darkness/4005-24347/\"> Darkness</a> except that they are sentient beings made of light and created by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43945\" href=\"/the-angelus/4005-43945/\"> Angelus</a> in order to do her bidding. These creatures of light live within a warrior and military like society where each member belongs to a certain rank. In order for the warriors to move up in rank, they must enter into combat with another warrior who is of a higher status in order to defeat and kill them so that they may take their place. The Angelus warriors are often never seen individually as they usually travel in groups. However, single members have been known to travel alone when spying on a target, or planning a discrete assassination attempt. The Angelus warriors seem to be easily killed by the Darkness, but their numbers rarely decrease, and they do not cease to exist when the Angelus is hostless. In fact, they will continue to do their mistress' bidding until she is able to find another suitable host. The Angelus warriors can also remain hidden from human awareness unless they choose other wise. It was also revealed that when an Angelus warrior is killed, it simply returns to the light. Their wide range of powers included enhanced strength and speed, self-propelled flight, various forms of fire manipulation, and all appear to be heavily trained warriors. </p>",

Shriek liked the creature and asked Carnage to let it join their 'family' as their son. The three soon came across <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15272\" href=\"/demogoblin/4005-15272/\">Demogoblin</a>, who found them by the connection he had with Doppelganger. Later, the being known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14507\" href=\"/carrion/4005-14507/\">Carrion</a> who had been following the trail of death the group had been leaving behind joined the 'family as Shriek's 'second son'. They accepted him into the group. Shriek started to show signs of rebellion against Carnage when she killed people without Carnage's concent and Carnage attacked Shriek. Doppelganger defended her but Doppelganger was killed by Carnage who threw the creature to it's death into the street, this action led to Demogoblin choosing to leave the family. Later when the rest of the 'family' was defeated, by an invention of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7258\" href=\"/deathlok/4005-7258/\">Deathlok</a> that amplified <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1935\" href=\"/dagger/4005-1935/\">Dagger</a>'s powers to an extreme level, Carnage disguised a victim as himself and escaped.</p><h2>Members</h2><ul><li><b>Carnage (Cletus Kasady)</b></li><li><b>Shriek</b></li><li><b>Doppelganger</b></li><li><b>Demogoblin</b></li><li><b>Carrion (Malcom McBride)</b></li></ul>",

In fact the Legion had saved most of Dryad's population in an evacuation, but their role was distorted by the Dark Man, and the 6 survivors set out on a path of vengeance.</p><p>After the facts were revealed, one of the 6, a sentient creature known as <a href=\"/blok/4005-9357/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9357\">Blok</a> joined the Legion. The other 5 continued to pursue a life of crime without the guidance of the Dark Man, acting individually or as the League of Super Assassins, or occasionally as members of other groups such as the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-villains/4060-47190/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47190\">Legion of Super Villains</a>. The other 5 members of the team were; <a href=\"/silver-slasher/4005-31021/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31021\">Silver Slasher</a>, <a href=\"/lazon/4005-34222/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34222\">Lazon</a>, <a href=\"/titania/4005-47503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47503\">Titania</a>, <a href=\"/neutrax/4005-34224/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34224\">Neutrax</a> and <a href=\"/mist-master/4005-34223/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34223\">Mist Master</a>.</p>",

To this end, Mento began gathering mortally wounded victims of engineered, near fatal accidents from around the world and transforming their bodies with the self re-generating element, Promethium. The results were the Hybrid, a group of individuals driven to commit crimes by Mento's psychic powers. Sirocco, Touch-N-Go, and Prometheus swelled the ranks of the Hybrid, but only Behemoth and Touch-N-Go were loyal to Mento's madness. The rest of the Hybrid resisted his powers at every opportunity.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Hybrid members got their powers from Dayton’s experiments with Promethium, a substance which Dayton Industries perfected during the time that Mento was searching for Madame Rouge and General Zahl. Using the Hybrid, Mento went after his step-son Gar Logan, now known as Beast Boy, and Logan's team mates in the Teen Titans. After several clashes with the Titans, the Hybrid broke free of Mento's control, and Mento's mind was cleansed of insanity by Raven.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Confused by their place and purpose in the world, the Hybrid took Dayton on a journey to discover their new lives. Tragically, many of them returned to villainy. Harpi, Touch-N-Go, and Sirocco joined Circe in an all out attack on Manhattan, while Gorgon, Prometheus, Pteradon and Behemoth were counted among the \"Fallen Players of the House\", a fight club run by the vileness Roulette.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>The Hybrid:On Paperback or the Chopping Block?</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4654796\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4654796-blue_beetle_ted_kord_0014.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.98660714285714\" data-width=\"448\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 448px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4654796-blue_beetle_ted_kord_0014.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4654796\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134753/4654796-blue_beetle_ted_kord_0014.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4654796-blue_beetle_ted_kord_0014.jpg 448w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134753/4654796-blue_beetle_ted_kord_0014.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Hybrid were also slated to get their own ongoing series with Art Nichols on art chores. Harpi of the Hybrid abruptly appeared in New Titans #87 in 1992, in this plot the Harpi longing for freedom from Dayton Estates. This plot line with the Harpi was never written into any of the stories of the ongoing comic publication. The Hybrid did not appear for the remainder of the New Titans series, which was cancelled after issue #130. There was a listing and description for a Hybrid ongoing series in DC Comics’ Publishing Plans for the year of 1993.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Members</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Pteradon</b> - Capt. Israel Harel was an <a title=\"Israel\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Israeli</a> commando who led the rescue of a <a title=\"Wide-body aircraft\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft\" rel=\"nofollow\">jumbo jet</a> which had been forcibly landed at a <a title=\"Qurac\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qurac\" rel=\"nofollow\">Qurac</a> airport, during which he was shot in the back and dropped into the ocean. Recovered by Dayton's agents and subjected to Promethium, Harel became a human <a title=\"Pterosaur\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur\" rel=\"nofollow\">pterodactyl</a>. Possessing claws and the ability to fly at <a title=\"Supersonic\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic\" rel=\"nofollow\">supersonic</a> speeds, Pteradon combined his powers with tactical knowledge.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Sirocco</b> - Cassandra Sharp was an amateur <a title=\"Geology\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology\" rel=\"nofollow\">geologist</a> until she was smothered by a sandstorm in the heart of <a title=\"Death Valley\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley\" rel=\"nofollow\">Death Valley</a>. Barely alive when she was rescued, Promethium transformed her into the \"Mistress of the Desert Winds,\" able to generate both blasts of sand and <a title=\"Hurricane\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane\" rel=\"nofollow\">hurricane</a>-force winds, by which she could fly. Combining her sand-blasts and wind-blasts, Sirocco could cause enormous damage.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Touch-N-Go</b> - A young street thief living in <a title=\"Chicago\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chicago</a>, <a title=\"Illinois\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illinois</a>, Amelinda Lopez was struck by a truck while committing a robbery, and was more dead than alive until she was subjected to Promethium. As far as she was concerned, Mento had saved her life and so, along with Behemoth, Touch-N-Go was the only Hybrid member honestly loyal to him. Touch-N-Go was able to temporarily steal the kinetic energy of anyone she touched, thus adding their strength, speed, and skill to her own.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Behemoth</b> - Born a mutant, Taro Raiden grew to abnormal size and became a Sumo wrestler until he was recruited by agents of Mento. Undergoing Promethium experiments voluntarily, he gained super-strength and denser-than-human skin. He was one of the two members of the Hybrid actually loyal to Mento's schemes.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Gorgon</b> - Greek archaeologist Andonis Bal and his wife were on an excavation at the base of Mount Olympus when a statue of <a title=\"Medusa\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medusa</a> they'd found came to life and attacked them. Blinded by the attack, Mento's experiments changed Andonis' hair into tresses of snakes, so he was able to see in all directions. These snakes were also capable of firing beams which temporarily turned anyone caught in their path into stone.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Harpi</b> - The wife of Andonis Bal, Angelika was at the same excavation site, and also mortally wounded by the Medusa statue. Infused with Promethium, she did not respond well to the treatment—her body was constantly wracked with pain, slowly driving her mad, but like her husband served Mento solely out of fear. After curing Mento, the Titan Raven used her empathic powers to cure Harpi of her pain. Harpi was able to fly, fire powerful force-bolts from her hands, and possessed razor-sharp talons on her fingertips, capable of slashing through brick or steel.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br/></h2><p>The Twelve is a group of independent mystery men that helped win World War II in Berlin with other superheroes like Captain America, Namor and the Invaders. </p><p>The Twelve is not an actual team, they were twelve mystery men who gathered together to search through the S.S. headquarters for any snipers or other Nazi soldiers. While in the headquarters, the mystery men were ambushed and fell through the floor into a secret tunnel. While in there, a Nazi leader injects the tunnel with gas to knock them all out. The Nazis then put the twelve heroes in cryogenic chambers so they can be medically examined for their super powers. </p><p>Russian forces invaded Berlin at the same time and  were able to defeat all of the Nazi scientists and directors that were involved in the apprehending of the twelve superheroes. Due to this fact, the heroes have remained in their cryogenic chambers, forgotten to everyone else. </p><p>In the present day, a construction site has been formed over the tunnel that the twelve have been isolated in when a construction vehicle falls into the tunnel. The American government is able to claim possession of the twelve mystery men and try to manipulate them into working for the government in this post-<a data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\" href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" slug=\"civil-war\"> Civil War</a> society.</p>",

This ensemble of heroes were <a data-ref-id=\"4050-1898\" href=\"/archie-comics/4050-1898/\">Archie Comics</a>' answer to the superhero team fashion that was made possible by DC Comics' contribution with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\" href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\">Justice Society of America</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\">Justice League of America</a> and Marvel Comics' own contribution, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\" href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\">The Avengers</a>. The first version of this team consisted of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31630\" href=\"/black-hood/4005-31630/\">Black Hood</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45912\" href=\"/the-comet/4005-45912/\">The Comet</a>, The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-38980\" href=\"/fly-man/4005-38980/\">Fly-Man</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32331\" href=\"/fly-girl/4005-32331/\">Fly Girl</a>, and The Shield III, son of the original <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32405\" href=\"/the-shield/4005-32405/\">Shield</a>. Their enemies varied from Spy Lord, Thornaldo, Bombor, to even <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31655\" href=\"/hangman/4005-31655/\">The Hangman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31772\" href=\"/the-wizard/4005-31772/\">The Wizard</a>, two heroes who were inexplicably turned to villains. Their adventures lasted until October 1966, with Issue #7 being their last issue.</p><h2><b>Red Circle Comics Incarnation</b></h2><p>The next version of the Mighty Crusaders arrived under the Red Circle Comics banner, and made their presence seen on March 1983 with The Mighty Crusaders #1. This incarnation of the Mighty Crusaders was different from its predecessor, on the basis that Fly-Man reverted his name to The Fly, and that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31897\" href=\"/the-web/4005-31897/\">The Web</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2041\" href=\"/the-jaguar/4050-2041/\">Jaguar</a>, and Lancelot Strong joined the team, along with a Wizard that's back to being a hero once again, and having a new member in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32330\" href=\"/darkling/4005-32330/\">Darkling</a>. Their series would last over twice as long as the original series, but it had to endure some deaths from the first Black Hood, Lancelot Strong, and Darkling. Their story would end in Issue #13 on September 1985.</p><h2><b>Impact Comics Incarnation</b></h2><p>DC Comics then decided to give a shot at making their own version of Archie's Mighty Crusaders, after obtaining the licenses to the characters to publish them under the Impact Comics imprint. The notable difference is that the adjective \"Mighty\" was dropped, and were just simply named \"The Crusaders\". Unfortunately, they lasted only eight issues, from May 1992 with Issue #1, to December 1992 with Issue #8.</p><h2>The Mighty Crusaders Special #1</h2><p>The story begins with a meeting of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57555\" href=\"/global-concern/4060-57555/\">Global Concern</a> based in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\" href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\">New York</a>. The head of the Global Concern is enraged over the failure that took place one week ago. Their leader Doctor Zarda shoots one of the members of the Board for the botch mission. Zarda then asks another member of the Board, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71363\" href=\"/ms-frey/4005-71363/\">Ms. Frey</a>, to give him all the information they have about the metahumans who ruined their operation last week.</p><p>There is flashback a week ago where an auction for super villains is being held by The Auctioneer, who is considered a world-renowned for his discretion and quality of merchandise. The Auctioneer is beginning to start the bid on a strange metal box whose contents are unknown and impossible to open. Suddenly, the Web smashes into the room. The Web knock the Auctioneer and seize the metal box. The Web then flies off with the box. We see a mysterious looking woman, who wanted to buy the box, teleport away from the scene.</p><p>We then see that the Web is flying away from the scene. We see the mysterious woman teleporting behind him and following him. Once The Web thinks he is safe the mysterious woman appears in front of the Web and attacks him. We learn that her name is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71364\" href=\"/the-persian/4005-71364/\">The Persian</a> and that she was the Global Concern’s agent that was sent to buy the metal box. The Web and the Persian battle, with the Web finally getting the upper hand which leaves the Persian teleporting away from the scene.</p><p>We then see that The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64902\" href=\"/inferno/4005-64902/\">Inferno</a> arriving with the rest of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57558\" href=\"/group-epsilon/4060-57558/\">Group Epsilon</a>. Infernos boss propels Inferno into the field to get the metal box from the Web. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-66680\" href=\"/general-latham/4005-66680/\">General Latham</a> then contacts Inferno through a secret line and tells Inferno that Group Epsilon cannot come into possession of the metal box. We cut to Inferno catching up with the Web where the two heroes brawl. The Web refuses to give Inferno the metal box.</p><p>While Inferno and the Web are brawling, a crook known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71375\" href=\"/the-buzzard/4005-71375/\">the Buzzard</a> leaps in and seizes the metal box. The Web grabs the Buzzard. The Buzzard stuns the Web. Inferno grabs the unconscious Web from falling off the building. The Buzzard flies off with the box. Inferno and Web make friends and realize they are on the same side.</p><p>Later the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31655\" href=\"/hangman/4005-31655/\">Hangman</a> is seen pursuing the Buzzard. The Hangman attack the Buzzard. Hangman obtains the box and defeats the Buzzard by teleporting him some where else. The Web, Inferno and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45912\" href=\"/the-comet/4005-45912/\">Comet</a> then arrive on the scene.</p><p>The Hangman explains that the box was originally a safe. That it was Abraham Lincoln’s idea. It was used to contain all the strange secrets, creatures and discoveries that were found in the American West until now where the Hangman believes that the glass of the hourglass is broken and that it needs to be repaired before what is inside of it gets out.</p><p>The Hangman then uses the secret combination to open the box. There is a huge explosion of green energy and a shadowy figure pops out of the box. The figure screams for our heroes to kill “it.” Suddenly, a large metal robot spider comes out of the box. The metal spider stabs the figure made of shadows. Our heroes start battling with the metal spider. We see that General Latham’s helicopter has arrived on the scene. Latham orders the Shield to join the battle. The Shield jumps out of the helicopter and attacks the giant robot spider. The Shield becomes the natural leader of our four heroes and starts barking out orders. Our heroes combine their abilities to defeat the spider and close the metal box. The figure of shadows asks if he found the right door. The right universe. The shadowy figure then disappears.</p><p>We shift to the Shield, the Web, Inferno and Hangman meeting with General Latham. Latham tells our heroes to join his team if they want answers to what is going on. Hangman states that the metal box was built as a doorway to a place that is decidedly other. And its inhabitants are also strange and bizarre. Latham says that there are villains and terrorists who wanted this metal box for the extra-dimensional portal it holds. For conquest or to harvest more creatures like what they battled today. Latham says the box has housed secrets like the ones contained in Project Liberty.</p><p>Latham holds a large book with the name Project Liberty on its cover. Latham says that they need to find the shadowy figure because he had access to every secret in the box while he was inside of the box. Latham says that there is a conspiracy hidden with the most secret organizations in the military like Project: Shield and Group Epsilon and beyond. Latham says that the Web, Shield, Hangman and Inferno are now all targets of the villains and terrorists who wanted the metal box. Latham gives each of the heroes a secure communications ear piece that he can use to contact them virtually anywhere on the planet. Latham says that they will use this location outside of as their safehouse. Latham says that this will be dangerous and that they all need to stick together. Our heroes all agree to do so.</p><p>We hop back to the present day at the meeting of the Global Concern in New York . Ms. Frey tells Zarda that they do not know the identity of the man made of shadows that sprang forth from the metal box. Zarda orders for her to find the man of shadows.</p><p>We slide over to the Group Epsilon Safehouse. We see that they have the shadowy man in a clear cube prison. The leader of Group Epsilon tells the shadowy man to tell her everything that he read while in the metal box. The shadowy man keeps asking if he found the right door. The man says that he thinks he was a secret. The leader of Group Epsilon walks away. We see her ears become pointed, her eyes flow yellow and a magical symbol appear on her forehead. She says that the door the shadowy man opened only spells trouble.</p><p>Later in the Web has a brief chat with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71818\" href=\"/kitcat/4005-71818/\">Kitcat</a> going over what is transpiring over a secret base in Colorado, where all of the Web's 98 <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57194\" href=\"/web-hosts/4060-57194/\">Web Hosts</a> are being remotely controlled by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57555\" href=\"/global-concern/4060-57555/\">The Global Concern</a> in order to discredit Web further, while preventing Web from regaining control through firmware updates due to the software declaring to be updated before. He noticed that there was one Web Host that wasn't affected by the override, for the fact that Host was nowhere near the others. He looks up her information, to find out that <a href=\"../../fly-girl/29-32331/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kim Brand</a> has not only the best effectiveness scores, but has also significantly modified her Web suit into a different outfit, and calls herself Fly Girl. Web goes to her place, first under threatening her to sue her for modifying her suit and breaching her contract. Unequivocally, she didn't budge, and dropped Web fast, forcing Web to compromise by canceling his lawsuit if she helps him. Fly Girl quickly agrees to this stipulation and joins Web in order to stop the Web Hosts from doing more damage. Unfortunately for both of them, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71362\" href=\"/doctor-zadar/4005-71362/\">Doctor Zadar</a> had a mole amongst the Web Hosts, and used him to send an explosive payload to eliminate The Cell, who was located there. The moles had dropped the package onto The Cell, eliminating them in the process, and from there on, the Web Hosts are commanded to attack Web and Fly Girl. Web goes in headfirst by getting to each individual Web Host and using an external USB drive to plug into each host's suit so it can be given back control to the wearer. Web quickly makes progress, but is met with more remote resistance from the remaining Hosts, who drive Web underwater. Fly Girl comes to help him, followed by the Hosts who Web thought were still under the override The Global Concern has put. Thankfully, Fly Girl managed to fix the rest of the Hosts' suits, thus severing the grip of the Concern's control of the suits. Web was quick to congratulate himself and Fly Girl for saving the Hosts, but Kim was quick to point out that an explosion just happened, and that this would've been avoided if he were more cooperative with other people. To that suggestion, General Latham came out once again to show him that by working together with his new group of teammates, they can be Mighty.</p><h2>Current Rosters:</h2><h3><strong>Mighty Crusaders:</strong></h3><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-32405\" href=\"/the-shield/4005-32405/\">The Shield</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-31897\" href=\"/the-web/4005-31897/\">The Web</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-31655\" href=\"/hangman/4005-31655/\">Hangman</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-32331\" href=\"/fly-girl/4005-32331/\">Fly-Girl</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-70649\" href=\"/war-eagle/4005-70649/\">War Eagle</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-64902\" href=\"/inferno/4005-64902/\">Inferno</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-45912\" href=\"/the-comet/4005-45912/\">The Comet</a></li></ul><h3><a data-ref-id=\"4060-57750\" href=\"/shadow-crusaders/4060-57750/\"><b>Shadow Crusaders:</b></a></h3><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-31630\" href=\"/black-hood/4005-31630/\">Black Hood</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-31655\" href=\"/hangman/4005-31655/\">Hangman</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-32086\" href=\"/jaguar/4005-32086/\">Jaguar</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "G- force are Japan's secret agents that prevents earth's conquest from alien invaders.",
    "description": "<h2>THE MISSION</h2><p>G-Force is the secret agent team created by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1358\" href=\"/director-anderson/4005-1358/\">Chief Anderson</a> of the International Science Organization (ISO). Chief Anderson is the Chief of Security of the ISO as well as the Governing Board Member of the United Global Alliance (UGA) and reporting to United Global Alliance President Frances Kane.</p><p>The ISO was originally formed to combat the common ills of the planet including the elimination of pollution and advancing technological and scientific research for the betterment of mankind. Their goals to eliminate hunger and disease as well as the general safety and security of the planet were driving forces.</p><p>Knowing that there were threats beyond the recent wars, and suspecting an enemy of an extraterrestrial nature, Chief Anderson felt more needed to be done after the defeat of the Chaos Republic, mercenary forces recently defeated by United Armed Forces squadrons, and the reason for the formation of the United Global Alliance.</p><p>It was during the war against the Chaos Republic that the ISO stumbled onto the existence of another force that was an even greater threat to mankind than the Chaos Republic. Chief Anderson believed that the force was extraterrestrial in nature from a planet known as Spectra and that Spectra was quietly invading Earth with the ultimate goal of global domination and conquest. Ultimately, they intended to enslave the entire populace.</p><p>With the defeat of the Chaos Republic, ISO quietly turned their attention to the Spectran invaders in order to spy on them and gather as much information as possible. The spies were gathered from their existing forces as well as allies from during the Chaos Republic Front Wars.</p><p>In addition to those forces and spies, Chief Anderson also took the initiative and gathered a group of young people that he secretly trained and modified to combat the Spectran Enemy. That group of individuals is known as G-Force.</p><p>Although their initial training was focused on espionage, it soon became evident that they would need to prepare for a more active role for special circumstances such as combat and infiltration, more combat oriented than the normal spy. Each of the young members, five in total, was trained in special equipment and vehicles in order to meet the oncoming threat head on.</p><p>It was during this time that Spectra began to increase their Doomsday style attacks, first with the attack of a Giant Robot/Beast dubbed by ISO as the Iron Terrapin. The first job of G-Force was to stop the Iron Terrapin at which time it was Chief Anderson’s recommendation to President Kane that they fully activate G-Force as they were the only trained and organized force prepared to combat Spectra.</p><p>G-Force is the product of Project Gatchaman, a group that was originally established as an international peacekeeping service to any requesting such help. However, with the rise of Spectra, their mission was changed in order to combat the more direct threat posed on a Global Scale by the off world enemy.</p><p>Answering only to the President and Chief Anderson, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47654\" href=\"/g-force/4060-47654/\">G-Force</a> was headed by and dispatched from Neptune Research Facility and monitored with special earpieces and video monitoring for progress and success or failure of missions. With a support staff of hundreds of individuals as Center Neptune, the entire G-Force staff, including the scientists, mechanics and administrative staff are focused on combating and stopping Spectra.</p><p>Quick and agile in operations, G-Force is an “at need” force able to function independently outside of the normal chain of command. They are able to go where they are needed when they are needed without multiple layers of bureaucracy to slow or stop their progress. Their response time, due technological advancement, is two hours and they can be on site anywhere on the globe in that time.</p><h2>THE TEAM</h2><p>The Team for G-Force was chosen from young individuals for the ability to adapt, retain knowledge and for the time needed for their bodies to adapt to preparation required for the coming rigors they would endure.</p><p>In addition to extensive physical and mental preparation and discipline over the course of ten years, each individual was implanted with various Cerebonic devices to increase mental and physical capabilities (See section on Cerebonics).</p><p>The leader of the team is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1355\" href=\"/mark/4005-1355/\">Mark</a>, Team Commander and Call Sign G-1. He is courageous, considerate, tactful and patient. The second member is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1353\" href=\"/jason/4005-1353/\">Jason</a>, Weapons and Tactical Specialist as well as Navigator, Call Sign G-2. His personality is that of a crass and impatient individual but is viewed as a defense mechanism from his turbulent past. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1356\" href=\"/princess/4005-1356/\">Princess</a>, Call Sign G-3, is a Reconnaissance, Electronics and Explosives expert and serves as the Communications for the Team. She is insightful, compassionate and intelligent. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1354\" href=\"/keyop/4005-1354/\">Keyop</a> is also Recon and Communications but also serves the additional task of Data Interpretation. He is the youngest member of the team and his Call Sign is G-4. The final member is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1357\" href=\"/tiny/4005-1357/\">Tiny</a>, Call Sign G-5, is not as quick and agile as the rest of the team but is a masterful pilot of the Phoenix and was quickly chosen to be permanent pilot of the ship. He is skilled at tactical but excels beyond that as a pilot. He is both the most stable member of the group and the strongest.</p><h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2><p>In addition to physical training, the team is equipped with five vehicles for their use in missions. The Command Ship is the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-57029\" href=\"/phoenix/4055-57029/\">Phoenix</a> and works in conjunction with, and combines with, the Summit Jet piloted by Mark, the Space Mobile piloted by Jason, the Galacticycle piloted by Princess and the Star Buggy piloted by Keyop. When combined together and docked with the Phoenix, they are a versatile and effective fighting force that can responds to nearly any emergency.</p><p>Along with specialized vehicles, the team has a variety of weapons as well. Feather Darts, three varieties, come as a simple spiked dart, a spiked dart with side barbs as well as a rocket powered dart with a spike point.</p><p>A Variety of mini-bombs are carried by each member and detonates on impact when thrown.</p><p>Each member of the team has a tracking device in the heel of their boot as well as timing mechanisms that are carried in the other boot heel.</p><p>Explosive Powder and Explosive Putty are also carried for a variety of uses as needed.</p><p>Although these are a few examples of the weaponry carried by G-Force, they can be armed with various other weaponry at need.</p><p>Each member of G-Force wears a Wrist Communicator on their left wrist. Along with the capability of communicating to any other member of the team no matter where they are on the planet, the communicators allow for a variety of transformations/transmutation of each team member and their vehicle. Besides transmuting from normal clothing into their associated uniform, each Wrist Communicator can transform their vehicle from Civilian to Mission Mode and back as well as each or all team members as required. The various modes can occur in over a dozen combinations.</p><p>The uniforms of the G-Forces members must be within the field (radius) of their individual Wrist Communicator or return to the civilian mode also known as the Memory Shape. Although certain elements of the uniform can be removed, they must remain in the field to continue as their transformed version.</p><p>The G-Force uniform cape provides additional protection as well as providing limited flight and gliding capabilities. Element proof in any form, the clothing also keeps each members body temperature constant no matter the environment and is bullet resistant regardless of mode. Other projectiles are also resisted such as energy bolts, darts, knives, arrows, and spears and similar.</p><p>The bird motif of each uniform was chosen by the members of the team.</p><p>Helmets: In addition to basic protection, the helmets in conjunction with the visor and wrist communicator provide basic scanning data, a Heads-Up Display, various viewing modes including infrared, heat detection and X-Ray as well as other spectrums. Basic material analysis and status displays can be shown as well and a loud speaker option is available as well.</p><p>Mark, Jason and Princess have antennae on the back of their helmets providing a direct like to the master computer at Center Neptune. This allows them to call up needed files when away from the Center or the Phoenix.</p><p>The helmets have Active and Passive Modes and can be turned off if needed.</p><p>The heels of each team member’s boots contain false bottoms which can be packed with a variety of small, needed items. The boots also have special soles for gripping surfaces as well as electromagnets which allow for sticking to surfaces which is useful for escaping or stealth.</p><h3>INDIVIDUAL WEAPONRY</h3><p>Each member of G-Force carries an individual weapon in the field besides the weapons common to the team.</p><p>Mark, Commander of the team, carries a Sonic Boomerang that resembles a bird of prey. The weapon, when thrown, extends wings and emits a signal can that temporarily disable an opponent and render them unconscious. The “wings” of the weapon are sharpened which makes them an effective weapon for slicing or as an edged weapon as needed. Inside the pointed nose of the weapon is a hollow where explosives can be planted and the nose is a pointed spike to penetrate and stick into surfaces. Although the boomerang has no method of propulsion and has to be thrown, it does have a homing device that will ensure that it returns to Mark’s hand when thrown. Each G-Force member’s helmet neutralizes the signal of the boomerang.</p><p>Jason’s unique weapon (Tiny has a similar weapon) is an advanced Cable Gun, air powered/driven, that can fire a variety of projectiles, act as a drill or cutting torch depending on the nose attachments used or projectiles that can be used as knockout gas bombs, darts or flash grenades. As the name states, the Cable Gun can fire a cable from the front or rear of the gun and the reel is stored inside the gun. The cable can support the weight of three adults and reel in.</p><p>Princess carries a very special Yo-Yo that is an effective offensive and defensive weapon. The Yo-Yo can be filled with explosive charges or putty at need but her Yo-Yo also has a built in timing device in the event the team needs a timed distraction or escape. Besides explosives, the Yo-Yo has an electrical charge that can be used to incapacitate an opponent through electrical shock or to detonate the internal explosive. The wire can support Princess’ weight.</p><p>Keyop’s Clackers, as they are known, is a bolo type weapon with a metal wire connecting two weights together. Functioning like a bolo, it can be used to trip, capture or knock out an opponent or an explosive can be enclosed as with Princess’ Yo-Yo or Mark’s Boomerang.</p><p>Tiny carries an Air Gun like Jason’s although with less capabilities and smaller. He does carry a large variety of suction cups, darts and edged items that can be fired from the gun. It can also fire a cable that will support Tiny’s weight as well as of an individual in need of rescue.</p><h3>CEREBONIC IMPLANTS</h3><p>Each member of G-Force has Cerebonic Implants. The enhancements of these implants increase balance, stamina, endurance, senses, health and mental acuity as well as many other benefits. The team members can continue to function under duress and go far longer without sleep or food than normal individuals, up to a week before feeling ill effects (if necessary but not recommended). The Cerebonics required a great deal of training in order for the team to function with them.</p><p>Although the exact nature of the implants are not divulged, it is shown that they produce results where G-Force functions well beyond the means of normal humans. What is known is that the team can turn the implants on and off, activating them when needed for extraordinary feats. Through years of training, the team has learned to control the implants and their specific functions and increase one element of the implants without activating other implants, for example a learning implant without activating a physical implant.</p><p>Activating implants too often can create strain on the system and stress on the heart, muscles or nervous system. The implants do increase the use of natural chemicals to the point of overproduction which are normally harmless but in high levels can cause sickness or death. These chemicals need to be dispelled through normal exertion or can build up and cause health problems.</p><h2>MISSIONS</h2><p>Through the use of extraordinary weapons, abilities and the support of ISO, the G-Force Team is called on to confront their first threat, the Iron Terrapin. Through the use of their technology and quick thinking, the G-Force was able to defeat the initial threat to Earth though only barely. But Zoltar and Spectra have only just begun their conquest of Earth.</p>",

    "deck": "The final out coming in a nightmarish combination of a Soul Reaper's powers with a Hollow's evil spirit.",
    "description": "<p>In the Bleach series there are many characters that are proving to be very powerful. One of these teams is called the Arrancar. Arrancar are Hollows who have given up their masks and used the Orb of Distortion to gain a Soul Reaper's powers. During the series Arrancar show up in many forms and have various power levels.</p> <blockquote><p>Appearance and Behavior</p></blockquote> <p>The first Arrancar that is revealed in the series is Grand Fisher after he comes back to earth to destroy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\" href=\"/ichigo/4005-42468/\" slug=\"ichigo\">   Ichigo</a> for having been defeated by him earlier. Grand Fisher looks like a giant human who is wearing his Hollow mask half off and has his Hollow body draped over himself. Grand Fisher is an enormous monster, but he is no where near as powerful as a full Arrancar. The first fully powered Arrancars that show up are <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51667\" href=\"/grimmjow-jeagerjaques/4005-51667/\" slug=\"grimmjow-jeagerjaques\"> Grimmjow <br/></a> </p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-51667\" href=\"/grimmjow-jeagerjaques/4005-51667/\" slug=\"grimmjow-jeagerjaques\">  Jeagerjaques</a>, and Espada and five of the weaker Numero Arrancar. Most Arrancar look like Soul Reapers, but still have fragments of their masks on their heads. Since the Arrancar are suppose to be the Hollow equivalent to Soul Reapers they wear a uniform similar to the Soul Reapers, only they have various jackets and their uniforms are white. Most of the Arrancar carry a Zanpaku- to and display a Hollow's hole on their body. All the Arrancar have very independently defined personalities, but they are all very fierce and dangerous in battle.  <blockquote><p>Ranks</p></blockquote> <p>There are several classes set up for the Arrancar, the strongest being the Espada, and the weakest being the Numero. Also in the classes is a list of Arrancar that were once Espada, but have lost their rank because of more powerful Arrancar coming into existence. These are called the Privaron. Also there is a class of Arrancar that basically servants for the Numero, much weaker than the other arrancars in comparison. These are the Fraccion.</p> <p> <u><b>Fraccion</b></u></p> <p>The fraccion are weak and only exist for the sole purpose of serving the Numero. The number of Fraccion varies depending on the Numero and how much they feel that they need servants.</p> <p> <u><b>Numero</b></u></p> <p>The Numero are the middle ground for the Arrancar ranks. They are weaker than the Privaron and Espada, but have never lost their rank. Some of the Numero are at a lieutenant level of power, but only when the lieutenant's power is sealed in the human world. Grimmjow took a team of Numero to attack Ichigo and the others at the beginning of the Arrancar storyline, and proved them to be very powerful at first. Once the power limitation was removed from the Soul Reapers, however, the Numero proved to be at about the same level as a fifth seat or less. There are many more Numero than there are Espada but have the same abilities usually. All Numero's rank is determined by a two digit number.</p> <p><b> <u>Privaron</u></b></p> <p>The Privaron are the unfortunate few that were once Espada but were replaced. When Aizen brought the Orb of Distortion with him to make new Arrancar. The Privaron had their old one digit number replaced by a three digit number that identifies them as being stronger than Numero, but not as powerful as their replacements and former peers. So far there has been three Privaron shown, each in a ridiculous appearance and behavior. The Privaron were once at the top of the hierarchy of the Arrancar ranks but have fallen, now they will do anything to get back to the top of the list.</p> <p><b> <u>Espada</u></b></p> <p>The Espada are the comparitive equivalents of a Soul Reaper Captain. The Espada are the top ten Arrancar and have a number to identify their rank tattooed on their body. The Espada are very powerful and are former Vasto Lorde and Adjuchas, with the exception of one who was a Gillain class Menos Grande. The Espada are each very different in their power according to their rank too. The difference between the number one ranked Espada and the tenth ranked Espada is very large. It is mentioned that the Espada are feared to be even more powerful than a Captain level Soul Reaper.

These techniques include the Cero (Zaero) blast. This technique allows the Arrancar to gather energy at their mouths and release it as a concentrated blast at their opponents. The Cero is very powerful, but requires a bit of time to build up, making the user a sitting target for attacks when they are building up the attack.<br/><br/>A third technique the Arrancar use is the Throat, a teleportation technique that allows them to travel back and forth between their world Heuco Mundo, and other worlds<br/><br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13927/320066-40177-ulquiorra-schiffer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-320066\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13927/320066-40177-ulquiorra-schiffer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-320066\"><img alt=\"Ulquiorra performing the Throat technique.\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13927/320066-40177-ulquiorra-schiffer.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13927/320066-40177-ulquiorra-schiffer.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Ulquiorra performing the Throat technique.</figcaption></figure><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b> <u>Soul Reaper Powers</u></b><br/><br/>The Arrancar have several of the same abilities as the Soul Reapers, but they have different names than their adversaries. One of these techniques is the Sound, a substitute for the Flash Step. The arrancar also use a technique to sense others Spirit Pressure called the Inquiry.<br/><br/>The Arrancar also have a technique called the Steel Skin. Which is created by compressing large amounts of spirit particles. In this technique the Arrancar has a natural skin that is almost impenetrable to most weaker attacks.<br/><br/>Arrancar also carry a  Zanpakuto but with a different release. When an arrancar draw their Zanpakuto they regain their hollow form and powers. Their new form is somewhat different instead of their limbs being black they are white and their strength gain a large power boost.",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Origin</h2><p>  The original Pact was formed by the father of Night Thrasher, the Father of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44214\" href=\"/midnights-fire/4005-44214/\" slug=\"midnights-fire\">        Midnight's Fire</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2119\" href=\"/silhouette/4005-2119/\" slug=\"silhouette\">         Silhouette</a>, the father of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2145\" href=\"/smiling-tiger/4005-2145/\" slug=\"smiling-tiger\">          Smiling Tiger</a>, the Father of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2146\" href=\"/silk-fever/4005-2146/\" slug=\"silk-fever\">       Silk Fever</a>, the father of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2144\" href=\"/bloodstrike/4005-2144/\" slug=\"bloodstrike\">      Bloodstrike</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2147\" href=\"/left-hand/4005-2147/\" slug=\"left-hand\">     Left Hand</a>. </p><p>  These people had been in the same fight unit during the Vietnam War. They had stumbled upon an ancient temple of the Dragon's Breadth where they where met and captured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2148\" href=\"/tai/4005-2148/\" slug=\"tai\">           Tai</a>. There they learned that the Dragon's Breadth was an ancient organization that had once found a mystic well capable of inter dimensional power. They bred their offspring carefully until one generation appeared that was better at harnessing the energies of the well better that any before them. Their children would mate with westerners and those children would use the energies of the well to dominate the world. Things did not go well however. Night Thrasher's father refused to participate, and the Left Hand's child was in an accident and ended up in a severe coma. After this the Left Hand went to study magic in hopes of curing his daughter. He soon gathered the children of the pact to help defeat Tia.  <br/></p><h2>Creation<br/></h2><p>The Folding Circle was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41350\" href=\"/fabian-nicieza/4040-41350/\" slug=\"fabian-nicieza\">   Fabian Nicieza</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-2123\" href=\"/mark-bagley/4040-2123/\" slug=\"mark-bagley\">  Mark Bagley</a> in 1992 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-4407\" href=\"/the-new-warriors/4050-4407/\" slug=\"the-new-warriors\"> New Warriors</a> # 21. <br/></p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Pre Guards! Guards!</h2><p>There were originally only three watchmen in the night watch, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47812\" href=\"/samuel-vimes/4005-47812/\" slug=\"samuel-vimes\">Samuel Vimes</a>, Fred Colon and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47815\" href=\"/corporal-nobbs/4005-47815/\" slug=\"corporal-nobbs\">Corporal Nobbs</a>. At the time the watch house was situated on Treacle Mine Road. The Watch only existed at the time for the sake of having one. The streets were ruled by the guilds and crime was out of control. There were parts of the city the watch dared not enter (namely, The Shades). They tended to walk the streets at night shouting things like \"12 o' clock and all is well\" whilst ringing a bell. This had nothing to do with whether or not everything was well. Infact they preferred if they did not see any crime, because who knows what would have happened if they'd gotten in the way. If all wasn't well they'd find another street, instead preferring to find a nice quiet place to smoke a rollup, usually on a bridge to the Isle of Gods. This all changed during the events of Guards! Guards! with the introduction of Carrot Ironfoundersson.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Post Guards! Guards!</h2><p>By the end of Guards! Guards! Carrot has almost singlehandedly reformed the Watch. It now includes several members, of several different species. The Watch House has moved to Pseudopolis Yard, and they are actually doing their job. After saving Patrician Vetinari's life he agreed to build more watch houses around the city. All of the watch now came under the command of the now Commander Vimes. Some states for the Sto Plains have started poaching trainee watchmen after seeing the benefit. Vimes tolerates it because he likes the idea of watchmen everywhere being trained to obey him.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Ranks</h2><p>Acting Constable (rank used while in training) <br/></p><p>Lance-Constable <br/></p><p>Constable <br/></p><p>Lance-Corporal<br/></p><p>Corporal<br/></p><p>Sergeant<br/></p><p>Sergeant-at-Arms<br/></p><p>Lieutenant<br/></p><p>Captain<br/></p><p>Commander<br/></p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Oath</h2><p>The oath to swear in new watchmen is as follows:</p><p>I, [recruit's name], do solemnly swear by [recruit's deity of choice] to uphold the Laws and Ordinances of the city of Ankh-Morpork, serve the public trust, and defend the subjects of His/Her [delete whichever is inappropriate] Majesty [name of reigning monarch] without fear, favor, or thought of personal safety; to pursue evil-doers and protect the innocent, laying down my life if necessary in the cause of said duty, so help me [aforesaid deity].
