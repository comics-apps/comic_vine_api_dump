The title was not officially used in the comics, but it was used as a subtitle for the collected editions published after No Man's Land. This included the collected editions for the storylines <a href=\"/batman-evolution/4050-38566/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38566\">Evolution</a> and <a href=\"/batman-officer-down/4050-33237/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33237\">Officer Down</a>. A few Detective Comics issues are not collected in those collected editions.</p><p>The Batman issues #575-587 taking place in the new re-openned Gotham have never been collected.

In this arc, applicants from all over the world attempt the Hunter Exam in order to professionally become Hunters. The main characters of the series are also introduced in this arc.",
    "description": "<h2>Summary</h2><h3>Pre-Hunter Exam</h3><figure><p> </p></figure><p><a title=\"Gon Freecss\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Gon_Freecss\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gon</a> is first seen at his home of <a title=\"Whale Island\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Whale_Island\" rel=\"nofollow\">Whale Island</a>, fishing for the <a title=\"Master of the Swamp\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Master_of_the_Swamp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of the Swamp</a> — a fish that five grown fishermen pulling together couldn't land. Gon made a wager with his <a title=\"Mito Freecss\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Mito_Freecss\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aunt Mito</a> that if he could catch the fish, she would allow him to take part in the <a title=\"Hunter Exam\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hunter Exam</a>. After a week of work, Gon finally succeeds and his aunt signs his application. Gon proceeds to go visit his friend, a grown-up <a title=\"Foxbear\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Foxbear\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foxbear</a> named <a title=\"Kon\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Kon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kon</a>, who Gon had raised since he was a cub. Gon tells Kon that he's going to become a Hunter and that he will do things the animals of the forest won't like. Since Kon is the king of the forest, he can't talk to Gon anymore. Kon walks away from Gon to a gathering of other animals.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap1-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a></sup></p><figure><p> </p></figure><p>Gon returns home and speaks to his aunt. She asks if Gon always knew his <a title=\"Ging Freecss\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Ging_Freecss\" rel=\"nofollow\">Father's</a> trade, and also tells him his father left Gon with her when he was still a baby; Gon replies being a Hunter must be an important job that family comes only second and that it's time for him to meet his father. He is then seen preparing to board a ship heading for the Hunter exam. Everyone in the town comes to say bye and wish him luck. Aunt Mito comes and tells him his father didn't abandon him; she made him give up Gon through the courts. Gon says he knew because she never looks at him when she's lying. He gets on the boat and yells back to her that he will return as a great Hunter.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap1-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a></sup></p><h3>Preliminary Phase</h3><figure><p> </p></figure><p>The first night on the boat, there is a huge storm that tosses about most of the would-be Hunters. After the storm, the ship's drunkard of a <a title=\"Captain\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Captain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain</a> walks around to see only three candidates still able to move (one of them being Gon is running back and forth trying to take care of the sea-sick). Later on, Gon is standing on the front of the boat where he predicts they will be hit by another storm, but this time it will be three times the size as the previous night. The captain knows he is correct and not guessing; he sees Ging in Gon. He asks who Gon's father is, and finds he is correct. The captain shows Gon how to steer the boat, he also announces that the next storm was coming and anyone who wanted to get off should right now.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap2-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a></sup></p><p>All but Gon, <a title=\"Kurapika\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Kurapika\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kurapika</a>, and <a title=\"Leorio Paradinight\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Leorio_Paradinight\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leorio</a> leave. The captain asks why they all want to be hunters. Gon answers while the other two don't. Leorio asks why they should tell him when he just steers the ship. The captain replies he screens applicants and it is up to him whether or not they pass. The remaining two tell him. While explaining, Kurapika annoys Leorio to the point they go out into the storm to fight. When a <a title=\"Katzo\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Katzo\" rel=\"nofollow\">crew member</a> jumps in to stop them he falls overboard and Gon jumps after him, narrowly missing falling into the ocean thanks to Kurapika and Leorio grabbing his ankles in time to pull them both back on board.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap2-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a></sup> When they reach land, the captain gives them a hint to head to a lone cedar tree outside of the city to find their navigators. Gon decides to go, and Kurapika decides to tag along. Leorio stays until he finds that there was another trick to weed out the weak. And he runs off to join the other two.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap3-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a></sup></p><figure><p> </p></figure><p>Later they reach a village that seems to be deserted but Gon says he can hear them and so can Kurapika. Then the whole population of the village comes out to start The Mind-Boggling Two Choice Quiz. <a title=\"Quizzing Lady\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Quizzing_Lady\" rel=\"nofollow\">The leader of the village</a> asks two questions and all they can say is 1 or 2. <a title=\"Matthew\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Matthew\" rel=\"nofollow\">The man</a> who heard the clue walks in and says he'll go first. She asks him, \"Men have taken your mother and your true love captive. Who do you save?\" He chooses 1 thinking that's what she wants him to say. She says he may go. Leorio starts yelling because of the preposterous question. Kurapika tells him to be quiet seeing Gon has heard something. She asks another impossible question and Leorio attacks her. Kurapika blocks it stating they passed, since silence is the answer. He adds he heard the other man scream, meaning he was killed, but no one knows how.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap3-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a></sup></p><figure><p> </p></figure><p>After a short walk, the trio reaches a house and find the navigator couple being attacked by a magical beast called a <a title=\"Kiriko\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Kiriko\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kiriko</a>. The beast takes off with the lady followed by Gon and Kurapika, with Leorio staying behind to take care of the man. While chasing after the creature Gon pulls ahead of Kurapika, closes in on the Kiriko, and bashes him in the head. The Kiriko drops the wife, who is caught by Kurapika. The creature still manages to get away from Gon, who continues chasing it. Soon he comes to clearing where the creature attacks him. Gon merely greets it and asks where the one he hit went to. It is revealed that both the Kiriko and the couple are a family and the ones who would take the three to the Hunter Exam.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a></sup></p><p>The next day, they arrive at a small restaurant. The disguised magical beast orders a specific meal, then the cook sits them in a room and delivers the meal. The room is actually an elevator that starts to drop. As they make their way down, Kurapika and Leorio try to find out whether Gon is taking the test for the wealth, or for the adventure. He doesn't answer.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap5-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Hunter Exam Begins!!</p></figure><p>Gon's Hunter Exam begins with him getting targeted by Rookie Killer <a title=\"Tonpa\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Tonpa\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tonpa</a>. Tonpa first introduces himself as a friend trying to help Gon. Tonpa then introduces some of the other regulars, Such as <a title=\"Bourbon\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Bourbon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bourbon</a> the snake charmer, <a title=\"Todo\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Todo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Todo</a> the wrestler, The <a title=\"Amori Brothers\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Amori_Brothers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amori Brothers</a>, <a title=\"Cherry\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Cherry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cherry</a>, and <a title=\"Geretta\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Geretta\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geretta</a> the huntsman. While doing the introductions they hear a bloodcurdling scream, and they look to see a man missing his arms courtesy of <a title=\"Hisoka\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hisoka\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hisoka</a> the magician who maimed him only because he bumped into him. Tonpa then offers Gon and the other two some juice. Gon, being the first to taste it, spits it back out saying it tastes funny, leading to Kurapika and Leorio dumping theirs on the ground.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap5-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a></sup> Afterwards Tonpa makes a hasty apology.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap6-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">[6]</a></sup></p><h3>First Phase</h3><p><a title=\"Satotz\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Satotz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Satotz</a>, the first examiner, begins the <a title=\"287th Hunter Examination\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/287th_Hunter_Examination\" rel=\"nofollow\">287th Hunter Examination</a> with an extremely long run down a tunnel. A kid on a skateboard ends up next to Gon, and he asks how old Gon is. He jumps off his board and introduces himself as <a title=\"Killua Zoldyck\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Killua_Zoldyck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Killua</a>. Gon looking back, seeing Leorio back and falling he drops his briefcase, he then gets his second wind and runs past. Gon uses his fishing pole and carries while he's running.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-chap6-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">[6]</a></sup> After running for 80km they come to a set of stairs and start climbing, while Satotz starts to pick up the pace.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-6\" rel=\"nofollow\">[7]</a></sup></p><h3>Second Phase</h3><figure><p>Cooking Test</p></figure><p>The second phase of the exam takes place in the <a title=\"Visca Forest Reserve\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Visca_Forest_Reserve\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visca Forest Reserve</a>, where the examinees meet Gourmet Hunters (and proctors) <a title=\"Menchi\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Menchi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Menchi</a> and <a title=\"Buhara\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Buhara\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buhara</a>.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">[8]</a></sup> Buhara's test is to find the world's most dangerous pig and bring it back to him so he can eat it. Gon and his friends complete the task easily along with 70 other applicants.However, Menchi, the second examiner, baffles the examinees when she tells them to make sushi, a traditional Japanese dish, as none of them knows what sushi is. Menchi overreacts because of an examinee making them all fail as a result, no one passes,<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">[9]</a></sup>which requires the Chairman <a title=\"Isaac Netero\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Isaac_Netero\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netero</a> to intervene. The test is taken to <a title=\"Mt. Mafutatsu\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Mt._Mafutatsu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Split Mountain</a> where examinees hunt for <a title=\"Spider Eagle\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Spider_Eagle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider Eagle</a> eggs. At the end of this stage, there are 42 applicants left.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-9\" rel=\"nofollow\">[10]</a></sup></p><h3>A Game at Midnight</h3><figure><p>Showdown On The Airship</p></figure><p>The 42 remaining applicants board the Selection Committee's airship, where it is revealed that their next phase of the exam will begin at 8:00 A.M the next day. As everyone rests up for tomorrow, Gon and Killua encounter Netero who challenges them to a game; if they win, he'd issue their licenses on the spot. All they have to do is take away a ball from Netero. Killua eagerly goes first but fails. Gon then takes his turn to take the ball but he also fails.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-10\" rel=\"nofollow\">[11]</a></sup> Time passes and when it seems Gon and Killua have tried every possible tactic, Netero suggests they attack together. Though they come seemingly close to it at one point, Netero rockets in between them at lightning speed and takes the ball. Killua calls it quits and ends up killing two applicants in his frustration; Gon, however, decides to play until he forces Netero to use his right hand. When he succeeds in doing so, Gon collapses in exhaustion where he is.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-11\" rel=\"nofollow\">[12]</a></sup></p><h3>Third Phase</h3><figure><p>3rd Phase: Trick Tower</p></figure><p>In the morning, the airship arrives at the top of Trick Tower. The 40 applicants are informed that the objective of stage 3 is to get down from the tower alive within 72 hours. The group is forced to team up with Tonpa.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">[13]</a></sup> The first serious test is to win 3 out of 5 matches against tower prisoners.

Majitani feigns unconsciousness in an attempt to run out the clock.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam_arc#cite_note-15\" rel=\"nofollow\">[16]</a></sup> Leorio and the leader of the prisoners bet on whether he's faking. Leorio holds the man above a long drop, and Majitani wakes up. He concedes the match to Kurapika, but the group loses a large chunk of their time because of the bet. Leorio goes next. His opponent is <a title=\"Leroute\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Leroute\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leroute</a>, an attractive woman. He loses ten hours in a bet.

They board a tour bus which will take them to the entrance of the Zoldyck estate. During the ride, they notice two suspicious tourists. The guide, <a title=\"Coco Loo\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Coco_Loo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coco Loo</a>, informs everyone in the bus about the background of the <a title=\"Zoldyck Family\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zoldyck Family</a>.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap39-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a></sup></p><figure><p>The Testing Gate</p></figure><p>When they arrive, Gon asks Coco Loo to let them inside the <a title=\"Testing Gate\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Testing_Gate\" rel=\"nofollow\">gate</a>, but the guide is unable to do so, as she does not have permission. The two suspicious tourists take action and try to take the keys from the gatekeeper, <a title=\"Zebro\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zebro\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zebro</a>. Zebro warns the two not to enter, but they continue on anyway. The two open and enter a side door to the estate in hopes of finding the Zoldyck Family. However, soon after screams are heard from within the gate. Zebro shrugs and calls <a title=\"Mike\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Mike\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mike</a>, telling him not to eat too much. The gate opens and the skeletons of the two ruffians are thrown out. The bus with the other tourists takes off in fear, leaving Gon, Kurapika and Leorio.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap39-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Mike meets Gon</p></figure><p>The three introduce themselves to Zebro as friends of Killua, saying they are here to visit him. Although delighted that someone cares to visit the family, Zebro is unable to let them in. The creature from before, Mike, guards the entrance to the property. He informs them if anyone enters through this side door, they will be eaten just as the two before had.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap39-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a></sup>However, Gon is insistent, and Zebro decides to take them inside through the Testing Gate. Inside the estate, the three meet Mike, a gigantic wolf-life dog. Zebro asks Gon if he wants to befriend Mike, but Gon refuses and admits that Mike is scary. They move on through the estate until they reach the gatekeepers' quarters. The three meet a fellow Hunter <a title=\"Seaquant\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Seaquant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seaquant</a>, who was after the Zoldyck family before he came to serve them. Seaquant insults the three of them, saying that if they are not able to open the Testing Gate, they are not good enough to meet the Zoldycks. Enraged by this, the three agree to train within the Zoldyck property for a few days in order to open the gates.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap40-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a></sup></p><p>After a total of ten days of training, all three are able to open the gates. Both Gon and Kurapika are able to open at least one gate, weighing two tons each. Leorio is able to open 2 gates, a total of four tons.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap40-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a></sup> With this, Zebro and Seaquant let the three proceed towards the mountain and manor. However, Seaquant worries about the next trial the three will face.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap41-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a></sup></p><h3>The Butler's Apprentice</h3><figure><p>Killua tortured</p></figure><p>Inside the Zoldyck mansion, a lady and a child are seen walking along the hallway. They enter a room where Killua is currently tortured by his older brother <a title=\"Milluki Zoldyck\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Milluki_Zoldyck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Milluki</a>. Killua's mother <a title=\"Kikyo Zoldyck\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Kikyo_Zoldyck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kikyo</a> informs him about his friends' arrival in their estate but obviously confident that they will not pass through the gates.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap41-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a></sup></p><p>Gon, Kurapika and Leorio continue towards the mountain but another servant stops them. She introduces herself as <a title=\"Canary\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Canary\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canary</a>, a butlers' apprentice. She was ordered not to let anyone pass her post, including Gon and his friends. When Gon tries to pass, she hits him hard with her staff. While Gon is attacked, a young child is watching the scene behind the bushes. The sun will soon set, but Gon still insists on going. Gon tells Canary that she is not like Mike, who is like a machine. Although she hides her feelings, she cares for Killua and has a heart. Canary starts to cry and stop hitting Gon, she asks him to save Killua but she is knocked unconscious.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap41-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a></sup></p><p>All of them look at the direction where the projectile came. A lady with elaborate gown who is accompanied by a child complains about Canary for talking too much about their family. She informs Gon that she is there to deliver a message from Killua, saying that he will not be able to see them.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap41-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a></sup> She introduces herself as Killua's mother and the child beside her is <a title=\"Kalluto Zoldyck\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Kalluto_Zoldyck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kalluto</a>. Kikyo begins to explain that Killua is currently in the isolation room to regret his past actions.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap42-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a></sup></p><p>Meanwhile in the isolation room, Milluki continues on torturing Killua but is furious when he finds out Killua is actually sleeping. Milluki informs him his friends have made their way through the gardens and are currently confronted by their mother. Milluki mocks Killua by telling him that he'll call their mother, and have his friends taken away. Killua then breaks out from one of the chains, threatening Milluki. Their grandfather comes in and orders Killua to go see his father. After he left, Milluki expresses his anger to <a title=\"Zeno Zoldyck\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zeno_Zoldyck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zeno</a>. Instead, Zeno asks Milluki what he thinks of Killua's abilities. Milluki phrases him, saying that Killua is one of them most talented members of the family, but he emotionally weak, making him a failure as an assassin.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap42-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a></sup></p><p>Zeno then informs Kikyo about Killua's freedom and his talk to his father. Kikyo is clearly upset and starts scolding her father-in-law through her visor. She excuses herself and leaves immediately. Kalluto stays for a while, glaring at Gon and his friends. When his mother called him, Kalluto quickly runs off after her.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap42-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a></sup> Canary regains consciousness, and agrees to take Gon and his friends to the Butlers' headquarters where they can make direct calls to the Zoldyck members.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap43-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a></sup></p><h3>Father and Son</h3><p>Before Killua sees his father, he remembers the day he ran away from home. He told his parents he didn't want his life to be controlled, injuring his brother in his side and his mother's face. While doing this, Kalluto watched the whole seen yet made no attempt to stop Killua.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">[6]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Father-Son promise</p></figure><p>He goes inside the room and his father <a title=\"Silva Zoldyck\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Silva_Zoldyck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silva</a> is sitting across the room. He asks Killua many things such as how the Hunter exam was like and the friends he made. Silva makes Killua sit with him to tell him his adventures. When Silva finally asks him if he wants to see his friends again, Killua nods. Silva makes Killua promise never to betray his friends and sets him free.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap42-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a></sup></p><p>Before Killua can get out of the mansion, Kikyo and Kalluto arrive just in time to stop him. Kikyo tells Killua his friends already left and he should go back to the isolation room. Instead of listening, Killua glares at his mother threateningly and leaves. Kikyo is surprised and proud that Killua has become mature.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap42-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a></sup></p><h3>The Coin Toss Game</h3><p>Canary leads Gon and his friends to the butlers' headquarters. The head butler <a title=\"Gotoh\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Gotoh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotoh</a> insists they should make themselves feel at home. He informs them that Killua is on his way, and should stay here to wait for him. To pass the time, Gotoh suggests a coin toss game. Whoever gets it wrong will be out the game and if all three of them lose, they will be expelled from the Zoldyck property.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap43-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Gotoh's game</p></figure><p>Gotoh begins with a simple warm up, with each level becoming harder and harder. Leorio is the first to lose, then Kurapika. Gon gets serious as Gotoh asks assistance from 2 other butlers. To their surprise, Gon guesses the right answer: the coin is actually in the butler behind him. The butlers applause for their performance. Killua finally arrives and reunites with his friends. Before he leaves, Killua reminds Gotoh not to take orders from his mother anymore, as they cannot stop him. Gotoh then asks Gon to watch over Killua as they leave.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap43-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a></sup></p><p>During their trip back to the airport, Killua tells Gon that Gotoh hates cheating. He also tells Gon his recurring nightmares of Gotoh chasing him with a knife.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zoldyck_Family_arc#cite_note-chap43-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a></sup></p><h3>Next meeting: Yorknew City at September 1st!</h3><figure><p>\"Our next meeting we'll be on September 1st in Yorknew!!\"</p></figure><p>When they arrive at the airport, Kurapika tells everyone that he'll leave. He will find a job to become a Blacklist Hunter that he always wanted. Leorio also bids farewell, as he wants to get ready to become a doctor.

    "description": "<p> </p><h2>Summary</h2><h3>Mecca for Fighters and Nen?</h3><p><a title=\"Gon Freecss\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Gon_Freecss\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gon</a> and <a title=\"Killua Zoldyck\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Killua_Zoldyck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Killua</a> arrive in <a title=\"Heavens Arena\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heavens Arena</a>, a place where fighters gather. Their objective is to train, earn money and find <a title=\"Hisoka\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hisoka\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hisoka</a> so Gon can give back Hisoka's badge during the <a title=\"Hunter Exam\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Exam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hunter Exam</a>. They start off in the lowest floor, easily winning their matches. They notice a fellow fighter, a boy named <a title=\"Zushi\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zushi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zushi</a> who is around their age.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Killua knocks out Zushi</p></figure><p>Later, Zushi faces off Killua in a battle. Confident in his abilities, Killua doesn't try his best to knock out Zushi. To his surprise, Zushi is able to withstand Killua's attacks on him. When Zushi is unable to take another hit, he releases an energy that sends Killua backwards. The feeling reminds Killua of his older brother <a title=\"Illumi Zoldyck\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Illumi_Zoldyck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illumi</a> and he thinks they are somehow using the same technique. Zushi's master <a title=\"Wing\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Wing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wing</a>, who is watching with the audience, shouts loudly to warn Zushi not to use <i>that</i>. Killua wastes no more time so he gives Zushi a powerful punch which throws him out of the arena. Although defeated, Zushi can still get up despite the attack.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap45-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a></sup></p><p>Gon congratulates Killua for winning yet another match, but Killua is wondering about the technique Zushi used. He tells Gon that he overheard Zushi's conversation with Wing, and he apologized for using that.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap45-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a></sup> Gon suggests that they should ask Zushi instead. Later, Zushi explains to them everything. Gon and Killua are unable to understand what Zushi is saying. Instead, Wing approaches them and Killua asks him if he can teach them about a technique called <a title=\"Nen\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Nen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nen</a>. In their quarters, Wing starts to explain what Nen is and its principles. He demonstrates the same energy Zushi used before. When they got back in the tower, Killua tells Gon that Wing was lying to them.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap46-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a></sup></p><h3>The 200th floor</h3><figure><p>Hisoka appears in Heavens Arena</p></figure><p>They finally arrive to the 200th floor. The hallway leading to the register is blocked by a strong aura. As they move forward, an employee shows herself. She informs them that they only have until midnight to register for the fight. Hisoka shows himself, and tells them they are not yet ready to set foot on the floor. They try to force their way through, but Hisoka is stronger. Wing appears behind them and volunteers to teach them the <i>real</i> Nen.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a></sup></p><p>Back in Wing's room, he demonstrates Nen and makes them feel the pressure. He opens their aura nodes so they can use Nen's technique called Ten. Two hours later, they come back to the 200th floor to face Hisoka. They successfully pass through his Nen barrier. After Hisoka leaves, they are confronted by 3 fighters, <a title=\"Gido\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Gido\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gido</a>, <a title=\"Sadaso\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Sadaso\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sadaso</a> and <a title=\"Riehlvelt\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Riehlvelt\" rel=\"nofollow\">Riehlvelt</a><sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a></sup> who challenge them to a fight.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap49-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">[6]</a></sup></p><h3>Gon Freecss vs. Gido</h3><figure><p>Gon surrounded by Gido's spinning tops</p></figure><p>The next day, Gon faces against Gido. Gido has already 4 victories and 1 defeat. He starts the match with taking out his spinning tops. Unaware of what the tops can do, Gon keeps on getting hit. He tries to dodge multiple times with no avail. Gon states the tops are strong as hammers. Gido continues on hitting him, and gets 5 clean points.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap49-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">[6]</a></sup>Gon tries to feel the movement of the tops but still fails. When Gon was thrown out of the ring, he sees a top near but not attacking him. He deduces that the tops are moving in all directions and shock themselves.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap50-6\" rel=\"nofollow\">[7]</a></sup></p><p>Gon finally realizes how to dodge the tops. He then tries to kick Gido but Gido himself spins like a top. Gon gets hit again which earns Gido another 3 points. Gon stays calm and uses <a title=\"Zetsu\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Zetsu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zetsu</a>. Wing, who is watching from the sidelines, is shocked because he didn't teach Zetsu to Gon yet. With Zetsu, Gon is able to dodge the tops with his eyes closed. He can feel the movements of the tops and he can still fight. Hisoka also watches Gon's match, and gets pumped up.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap50-6\" rel=\"nofollow\">[7]</a></sup></p><h3>The Aftermath</h3><figure><p>Killua ranting on Gon</p></figure><p>After his fight with Gido, Gon earned three fractures and twelve cracks on his ribs. It will take him 4 months to recover. Killua starts ranting to him about his recklessness. Wing enters the room and slaps Gon. He proceeds to rant all the things Killua said before. Wing forbids Gon to fight for 2 months and will not let Gon to exercise Nen or study it. Gon promises and Wing gives him a <i>wire of pledge.</i> Wing then asks Killua what are his objectives in competing. Killua replies that if he hadn't met Wing and Zushi, he will earn money and Gon will fight Hisoka. Killua then comes back to see Gon meditating in his room so he joins in with Gon.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap51-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">[8]</a></sup></p><p>Meanwhile, <a title=\"Kurapika\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Kurapika\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kurapika</a> approached the <a title=\"Sengi Guild\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Sengi_Guild\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sengi Guild</a> Hunter Agency only to be rejected by the <a title=\"Hunter Association agent\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_Association_agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hunter Association agent</a>. She tells him that Kurapika is a rookie and smart, and clients don't bother having rookies but Kurapika is beyond being an amateur. She states Kurapika's exam isn't over yet and asks if he can see something right beside her. And since Kurapika can't, she suggests for him to come back again after he learns it.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap51-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">[8]</a></sup> On his way back, Kurapika meets a man whose name is yet unknown, who steals his <a title=\"Hunter License\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_License\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hunter License</a> and so enters in on a match with Kurapika. After being utterly defeated, Kurapika receives his Hunter License back, whilst the stranger tells him that he's going to teach him about Nen, to which Kurapika accepts, and as such the older becoming his master.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">[9]</a></sup></p><h3>Hisoka vs. Kastro</h3><figure><p>Gon, Hisoka, Kastro and Machi in Heavens Arena</p></figure><p>One month later, Gon is perfectly healed, which surprises Killua because it needs four months for him to recover. Killua then presents two tickets for Hisoka's match. He claims that he's able to get reserved seats because they are fighters in the 200th floor and Hisoka's matches are quite popular. Before they can proceed any longer, Wing says no. Wing tells them that watching a match is like learning Nen. Killua leaves alone.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap51-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">[8]</a></sup></p><p>One hour before the match, Killua uses his assassination skills to approach <a title=\"Kastro\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Kastro\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kastro</a>'s room. He spots him sitting on a couch but before he knew it, Kastro is already by his side. This left Killua surprised yet he stays calm and lies to Kastro that he's there for his autograph. Kastro praises Killua for his Zetsu, although he already knew Killua was there ever since he arrived at the floor. Hisoka's match against Kastro is about to begin. Kastro states he has gone through vigorous training in able to defeat him. Kastro attacks first and hits Hisoka, while Hisoka wonders what just happened. In the sidelines, Killua deduces Kastro made an illusion.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap52-9\" rel=\"nofollow\">[10]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Kastro's Tiger Bite Fist</p></figure><p>Kastro charges at Hisoka again, this time Hisoka dodges the first punch, yet gets hit by the second.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap52-9\" rel=\"nofollow\">[10]</a></sup> Kastro continues to attack Hisoka through punches and kicks and with the help of his speed, Kastro is able to knock Hisoka down. The score is now 4-0. Hisoka stands up and begins to deduce Kastro's fighting ability. Kastro states he will take Hisoka's arm by using his signature move, the Tiger Bite Fist. Hisoka then gladly states he'll give his arm. Kastro is able to cut off Hisoka's right arm. Hisoka finally realizes the secret of Kastro's strength, Kastro actually has a double.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap53-10\" rel=\"nofollow\">[11]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Divine Tiger Bite Fist</p></figure><p>Kastro shows off his Doppelganger ability and tells Hisoka he'll take his left arm next.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap53-10\" rel=\"nofollow\">[11]</a></sup> Hisoka then hides his right arm with a piece of cloth. Out from the cloth, cards came out flying. He tells Kastro to choose a card and memorize it, add 4 to it, multiply it by 2 and subtract 6. He pulls a card out of his broken arm and shows an ace of spades. He gives the card to Kastro as a souvenir. Kastro charges again and takes his left arm. To their surprise, Hisoka's right arm is back and he starts to approach Kastro. Kastro continues to attack Hisoka with his double. Hisoka sends his cards towards Kastro which hits Kastro's left arm. Kastro continues to dodge but he eventually gets hit all over his body. Hisoka wins the match, leaving a dead Kastro behind.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-11\" rel=\"nofollow\">[12]</a></sup></p><h3>The Spider</h3><figure><p>A Spider appears</p></figure><p>Back in the shadows, a female awaits Hisoka and lets him show his wounds. She comments on Hisoka being a stupid jerk, and proceeds to treat his wounds as she is getting paid. <a title=\"Machi\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Machi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Machi</a> begins to stitch Hisoka's left arm with the help of her Nen ability. A few seconds later, Hisoka's left arm works perfectly. Machi proceeds to treat his right arm and charges him 20,000,000 <a title=\"Currencies in Hunter × Hunter\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Currencies_in_Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jenny</a> for the left arm and 50,000,000 Jenny for his right arm. He uses a combination of Bungee Gum and Texture Surprise to hide his wounds.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap55-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">[13]</a></sup></p><p>Machi then tells Hisoka she's leaving, and not to push himself before his wounds are fully healed. She reminds Hisoka the most important thing, be on <a title=\"Yorknew City\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Yorknew_City\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yorknew City</a> at 30 August before noon, all members should be present. Hisoka asks her if the boss will be there and she replies that if Hisoka doesn't show up, the boss will probably go after him. Hisoka also asks Machi if she could stay with him, but she already left. Later, Hisoka takes a shower and removes the <a title=\"Phantom Troupe\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Phantom_Troupe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phantom Troupe</a> tattoo on his back, with the help of his Texture Surprise.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap55-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">[13]</a></sup></p><h3>Triple Threat</h3><p>Wing tells Gon and Killua that they'll start training again with Zushi. As part of their training, Wing let Gon watch Hisoka's previous match with Kastro. Wing orders Killua and Gon to do <a title=\"Ten\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Ten\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ten</a>, while Zushi does <a title=\"Ren\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Ren\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ren</a>. While Zushi uses Ren, Wing tells him to use Gon and look at Hisoka's aura in his body during the match. Then, Wing tells Gon that he has 28 days left to register in another match and Killua has 27. Gon will have his match on June 10 while Killua on June 9th. Until then, they'll master using <a title=\"Gyo\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Gyo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gyo</a>.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap56-13\" rel=\"nofollow\">[14]</a></sup></p><figure><p>They never give up</p></figure><p>Later, Gon, Killua and Zushi arrive at the 200th floor and are confronted again by Gido, Riehvelt and Sadaso. Killua expresses his irritation to them, and Sadaso tells him they want to know when Gon and Killua are able to fight. Gon tells Sadaso that he'll fight on June 10. However, Sadaso can't fight after May 29 but he assures Gon that they'll fight.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap56-13\" rel=\"nofollow\">[14]</a></sup></p><p>In their room, Gon and Killua continue to practice and Zushi is watching them. After training, Zushi leaves and is followed by Sadaso. He uses his Nen ability to stop Zushi from moving. Killua approaches them and agrees to be their opponent. He assures them that he'll let them win and will offer victory to each one of them. However, Gon will not be able to fight them. The trio agrees and the match date is set on May 29. Sadaso gives Zushi back to Killua. Meanwhile, Gido is talking to Gon about Zushi's case.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap57-14\" rel=\"nofollow\">[15]</a></sup></p><p>The next day, Killua hears a man selling out tickets to Sadaso and Gon's match. In their room, Wing thanks Killua for looking after Zushi last night. Killua lies to Gon that someone called Killua on the phone saying his friend fell asleep on the main entrance. Then, Killua asks Wing to let him see Hisoka's match again, as he can do Gyo. Wing praises them to be able to learn Gyo in one evening. Killua tells Wing he already decided what date he's going to fight, which is May 29, his birthday, which is also a mega lie.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap57-14\" rel=\"nofollow\">[15]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Sadaso threatened by Killua</p></figure><p>Gon approaches Killua because he knows they threatened Killua too. Gon is willing to lose on purpose, but Killua has another plans. In his room, Sadaso is delighted to have his 6th victory against Killua and will soon become a floor master. Killua enters his room and threatens him. If Sadaso moves, use Nen or shout, he's dead. Killua makes Sadaso swear he'll never use a dirty trick again. A few moments later, Killua wins his match by withdrawal.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap57-14\" rel=\"nofollow\">[15]</a></sup></p><p>Sadaso contacts Riehlvelt through a phone and informs him that Killua is like the person who lives on the dark side. By just looking through his eyes, Sadaso knows the difference between their strength so he decided to quit, rather than die. Riehlvelt claims that Killua will not be able to scare him but to his surprise, Killua is already in their room. He tells them to respect the rules. Because of fear, Riehlvelt agrees to fight fair.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap58-15\" rel=\"nofollow\">[16]</a></sup></p><h3>Face Off: Part 1</h3><figure><p>Power to avenge</p></figure><p>The day of their matches has come. Gon thinks of using his <a title=\"Ging Freecss\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Ging_Freecss\" rel=\"nofollow\">father's</a> old fishing rod as weapon, to which Wing agrees. In the arena, Gon is the first one to make a move. Before Gon could come any closer, Gido spins himself like a top. Next, he sends his spinning tops charging at Gon but he simply blocks the tops. Gon successfully pulverizes the tops which makes Gido surprised how his Nen increased. Gon makes the next move by attacking with his fishing rod and it seems ineffective against Gido. After a series of attacking, Gon lifts a flagstone of the ring with his fishing rod, and smashes unto Gido. Gido is knocked down and Gon delivers his finishing punch and breaks Gido's metal leg. Gon threatens Gido not to lay a finger on Zushi again.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap58-15\" rel=\"nofollow\">[16]</a></sup></p><p>Shortly after Gon's fight, Killua faces against Riehlvelt.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap58-15\" rel=\"nofollow\">[16]</a></sup> This time, Riehlvelt is completely confident. Killua starts off by jumping too high and fast as Riehlvelt thought he disappeared. Killua appears behind him and tries to punch him but Riehlvelt is able to dodge it using Aura Boost. Killua merely shrugs this off, thinking he jumped too high.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap59-16\" rel=\"nofollow\">[17]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Killua vs. Riehlvelt</p></figure><p>Riehlvelt takes out two bullwhips, calling them Twin Snakes. He rapidly circles himself within the whips and it looks like a perfect defense, called Twin Snakes' Sons of Defense. While boasting about his abilities, he sends the whips towards Killua but he simply catches them. Albeit surprised, Riehlvelt then switches Twin Snakes' Thunder Snake which electrocutes anyone who has made physical contact with it. Riehlvelt begins to laugh and boast about his abilities again. This time, Killua sends him soaring through the air. He states that electricity doesn't hurt him as it was a part of his training and torture. Riehlvelt begs for Killua to save him and Killua agrees. Riehlvelt falls into his arms, while Killua is holding the Twin Snakes. Due to the electricity, Riehlvelt gets electrocuted and loses the fight.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap59-16\" rel=\"nofollow\">[17]</a></sup></p><p> </p><h3>Face Off: Part 2</h3><figure><p>Hisoka agrees to fight Gon</p></figure><p>A few days later, Gon faces off against Riehlvelt. This time, Gon didn't bring his fishing rod. Riehlvelt starts the match by using his Twin Snakes' Song of Defense. Gon crouches on the floor, picks up a flagstone with his bare hands, and smashes against Riehlvelt. However, he manages to dodge the attack. Gon runs after him and grabs both of his arms which made Riehlvelt drop his whips. Gon takes the whips and wraps it around Riehlvelt's neck. Gon pretends to switch on the Thunder Snakes and because of fear, Riehlvelt passes out, making Gon the winner.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap59-16\" rel=\"nofollow\">[17]</a></sup></p><p>Hisoka congratulates Gon in the sidelines. Hisoka agrees to fight Gon, and lets him decide when their fight is going to be.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap59-16\" rel=\"nofollow\">[17]</a></sup> Wing says it's time to see what Nen type Zushi, Gon and Killua are. Using wine glass filled full of water with a leaf on top, Wing demonstrates by using Ren around the glass, he reveals he's an Enhancer by increasing the volume of water. Gon is an <a title=\"Enhancer\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Enhancer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enhancer</a>, Zushi is a <a title=\"Manipulator\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Manipulator\" rel=\"nofollow\">Manipulator</a>, and Killua is a <a title=\"Transmuter\" href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Transmuter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Transmuter</a>. After training, the three come back to see how they've improved. Killua's water tastes like honey, Zushi struggles, and Gon creates an amazing amount of water, impressing and scaring Wing. Killua and Gon pass the final Hunter test.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-17\" rel=\"nofollow\">[18]</a></sup></p><h3>Gon vs Hisoka</h3><p>When Hisoka and Gon finally fight, it's a huge deal. The place is packed. Gon starts with a barrage of attacks, but gets hit quite a lot and the score becomes 1-0, Hisoka. Gon comes up with a plan by flipping part of the arena floor, much like he did in the previous fight, but this time punches it, causing a wave of rubble to fly toward Hisoka. In the rubble, Gon is able to get a very hard punch to Hisoka's face,<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-18\" rel=\"nofollow\">[19]</a></sup> scoring two points, and fulfilling his goal to... hit Hisoka in the face, 2-1, Gon. Hisoka casually walks toward Gon, and Gon does the same. Gon finally hands Hisoka his #44 tag from the Hunter's Exam, because he just punched him in the face. Hisoka then takes sometime to determine Gon is an Enhancer since he's simple minded and tells everyone other ways to determine a person's Nen type. Hisoka gets serious, attacking Gon at will, with Gon barely able to even dodge.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap62-19\" rel=\"nofollow\">[20]</a></sup></p><figure><p>Gon vs Hisoka</p></figure><p>Hisoka eventually scores a critical hit, Gon must back off and the score becomes 3-2, Hisoka. Gon tries to think of a strategy, but Hisoka gets bored. He wants Gon to attack him, but Gon refuses. It is revealed at some point Hisoka put his Bungee gum power on Gon's cheek. Hisoka pulls him over, giving a devastating punch,<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap62-19\" rel=\"nofollow\">[20]</a></sup> 6-2, Hisoka. The crowd doesn't seemed pleased at the scoring. Hisoka explains when he attached the power, and Gon realizes the Bungee gum can't be taken off. Hisoka becomes turned on like always and allows Gon to punch him repeatedly. Hisoka then punches Gon using the Bungee gum, is about to again, but Gon blocks the second punch. The judge gives Gon 2 points and 3 points to Hisoka, 1 for a knockdown. Gon argues he never was knocked down as the crowd begins to boo loudly.<sup><a href=\"http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Heavens_Arena_arc#cite_note-chap63-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">[21]</a></sup></p><p>Gon realizes he only has 1 point till he loses when suddenly a piece of the rubble from the arena floor smacks him in the face and loses. Hisoka used the time Gon argued to attach the Bungee gum to it. Hisoka is pleased with how strong Gon has become. Gon is upset, but realizes he still has a chance one day of defeating Hisoka. The judge admits he was in favor of Hisoka winning because he was worried of Gon dying during the fight.
