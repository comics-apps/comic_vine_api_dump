Hawkeye manages to escape unnoticed with Spider-Man, but Hammerhead and Owl don't appear to be as lucky.</p><p>After more thank you's from Spider-Man, Hawkeye leads the way to an underground bunker where a group of heroes are hiding out.

Iron Man reluctantly uses tech to establish that they haven't been infected by Ultron, but She-Hulk is still worried in case they were followed. Emma Frost however confirms that they weren't, and Hawkeye is surprised to be thanking her. Hawkeye, and Cage have a mild argument over how they should live, and Hawkeye is upset that the rest have given up. Iron Man explains that they have no plan, and when Hawkeye asks who's fault that is, Iron Man says that Captain America is working on one, but Cap doesn't look to be coping well with the current situation.</p><h3><a href=\"/age-of-ultron-2-book-two/4000-392349/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-392349\">Book Two</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2953163\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/121886/2953163-age3.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0793319415449\" data-width=\"479\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 479px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/121886/2953163-age3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2953163\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" data-width=\"592\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/121886/2953163-age3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/121886/2953163-age3.jpg 479w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/121886/2953163-age3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/121886/2953163-age3.jpg 479w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" data-width=\"592\"></noscript></a></figure><p>As Ultron's are passing destroying things in their path <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a> is attacked by a random man with a gun.

He reveals his name stating that secret identities don't mean anything anymore. Whilst saying that he woke up one morning to find the world had gone to hell he's asked about what he saw. A flash back shows Peter waking up and going through New York with flames around, and at the end of his recollection he asks if it was just in Manhattan. After finding out that the whole world is most likely under Ultron's control Peter says that he's happy he's with them. Iron Man then asks how he got kidnapped and another small flashback shows how, with Peter mentioning that his Spider-Sense didn't even go off. After saying that Hammerhead and Owl were going to sell him to Ultron Luke Cage asks why Ultron needed them to do that, and not just take him himself. After being told by Iron Man that the plan was to survive, Peter says that that's not something, until Captain America comes in stating that they finally have a plan.</p><h3><a href=\"/fantastic-four-5au-the-death-of-the-family-richard/4000-395247/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-395247\">Fantastic Four #5AU</a></h3><p><a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> (Sue Storm) puts <a href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Franklin</a> to bed saying that everything will be okay, before getting summoned by <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a> (Reed Richards).</p><p>Franklin then wakes up to a screaming <a href=\"/valeria-richards/4005-2470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2470\">Val</a> who's watching a message from the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> which says that something has gone catastrophically wrong.</p><p>The Fantastic Four return to Earth hearing that it's been attacked by Ultron after hearing from <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a> that it's the end of the World.

    "description": "<h2>Detailed Plot Summary</h2><h3>Part One</h3><p>The story begins with a prologue in 1938, where an old man named Matt Hawkins is bed-ridden and approaching death. He tells his physician, <a href=\"/angel/4005-36389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36389\">Dr. Thomas Halloway</a>, that he's been to the future, that there are gods and monsters and heroes there, and Dr. Halloway jots it all down - thinking that it's merely another case of senile dementia. But Dr. Halloway looked forward to his visits with the man, and is saddened when he learns that Hawk has passed. But the old man left something behind for Halloway, and when Halloway opens it - he realizes who Matt Hawkins was. Hawkins was the <a href=\"/two-gun-kid/4005-7240/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7240\">Two-Gun Kid</a>, a hero from the Wild West. And one of Dr. Halloway's childhood heroes. The gift that he had left behind for Halloway were his two revolvers and domino mask - along with a card that said 'From one hero to another'.</p><p>In 1939, aboard a ship in the <a href=\"/atlantic-ocean/4020-56201/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56201\">Atlantic Ocean</a>, <a href=\"/franklin-d-roosevelt/4005-31595/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31595\">President Roosevelt</a> is meeting with his friend Vincent Astor as well as his cousin Kermit Roosevelt. Kermit tells him that they've got a solid tip on the German's top-secret Project Nietzsche, and the President tells him to get <a href=\"/happy-sam-sawyer/4005-32606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32606\">Sawyer</a> to start working on a plan. Mr. Astor then tells President Roosevelt that their own secret project in <a href=\"/brooklyn/4020-57075/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57075\">Brooklyn</a> might be a complete waste - as the android keeps catching on fire. He says that <a href=\"/professor-horton/4005-7228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7228\">Professor Horton</a> and his partner <a href=\"/doctor-nemesis/4005-29259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29259\">Bradley</a> are working on it, but Kermit says that a man on fire might startle the Germans into making a mistake. President Roosevelt then mentions that the Navy's reporting that German ships are in the <a href=\"/bermuda-triangle/4020-56177/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56177\">Bermuda</a>, to which Kermit replies that they don't know what the Germans are doing - but that they're dropping depth charges out there. In the Sargasso Sea, a Nazi ship drops depth charges as its crew collect the dead <a href=\"/\">Atlanteans</a> that float to the surface. One of the crew comments that this is an important job, and that the studying these Atlanteans will help Germany. But <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> suddenly appears, and murders the ship's crew after seeing the bodies of his dead people.</p><p>A few weeks later, Professor Phineas Horton is unveiling his synthetic man in Brooklyn. When oxygen is released into the chamber, the man catches on fire, and the news of the '<a href=\"/jim-hammond/4005-12605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12605\">Human Torch</a>' provokes a reaction overseas. But it has also caused a reaction in the city, and with increasing demands by the people to lock away such a dangerous creation, Horton reluctantly agrees to seal the Torch in concrete. But Horton still continues to secretly communicate with his android, feeding it information about the outside world. And all of this creates a sense of longing inside the android, which eventually comes to a head when the Human Torch breaks free of his own prison to experience the world. But the android's inability to control his own flaming powers causes a massive fire throughout the city, and the Torch flees in the chaos. Meanwhile, Dr. Halloway is in the city during this fire, and stops criminals while saving innocent lives.</p><p>As World War II begins flaring up, <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a> and his friend <a href=\"/red-hargrove/4005-5178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5178\">Red Hargrove</a> are fighting over a pretty barmaid. Colonel Ellis and Lieutenant Sawyer interrupt their fight in the bar and quickly tell them that he has a job for them: He wants them to retrieve <a href=\"/abraham-erskine/4005-43681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43681\">Dr. Abraham Erskine</a> - a German scientist who wants to defect.</p><h3>Part Two</h3><p>In February 1940, the Human Torch remains missing in America, while in Germany, Erskine and his colleague Hans Bruder are examining <a href=\"/john-steele/4005-57571/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57571\">John Steele</a> - a bulletproof POW who was captured in WWI. Erskine tells Bruder that he's off to meet <a href=\"/heinrich-himmler/4005-8056/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8056\">Heinrich Himmler</a> in <a href=\"/luxembourg/4020-51270/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-51270\">Luxembourg</a>, and travels in a convoy of cars guarded by soldiers. Up in the air, Sawyer, Fury, and Hargrove are being transported by the Sky-Devils to intercept Erskine, and Fury and Hargrove jump out of the plane in parachutes. In just under two minutes, Fury and Hargrove manage to eliminate the entire convoy and successfully retrieve Dr. Erskine. In the voiceover narration by Halloway, it is believed that Erskine was such a huge blow to the Nazi war effort, that his extraction may have hastened the German invasion of Luxembourg, <a href=\"/france/4020-55778/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\">France</a>, and <a href=\"/belgium/4020-55916/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55916\">Belgium</a>.</p><p>Back in Brooklyn, we learn that Dr. Halloway has begun dressing up in blue tights and a red cape, and calling himself Angel (which was a nickname given to him by the prisoners where his dad was warden - after he proved that a falsely-accused murderer was innocent). He stops a bunch of mooks in a car and when the press ask what to call him, he replies, \"The Angel\". Halloway later admits that the name was corny, but more superheroes begin emerging following Angel's example - <a href=\"/fiery-mask/4005-46444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46444\">Fiery Mask</a>, <a href=\"/phantom-bullet/4005-47191/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47191\">Phantom Bullet</a>, and <a href=\"/mr-e/4005-47159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47159\">Mister E</a>. Elsewhere, in a farm outside the city, the Human Torch has learned how to control his powers, and saves an undercover cop who was about to be executed by some mob thugs. As spring begins, the Angel finds the dead body of the Phantom Bullet - who had been killed after only a few months as a superhero.</p><p>In an apartment room, Professor Hamilton (secretly a Nazi spy named Major Kerfoot) is in communication with his handler, and salutes 'Heil Hitler' before signing off. The cleaner spots him doing this, and when she tries running away, he strangles her to death to conceal his secret. Meanwhile, the Angel attends the funeral of Allan Lewis (Phantom Bullet) - and realizes to his surprise that he was a reporter who had written about the Angel's exploits. The Angel makes a silent vow to find the Phantom Bullet's killer. Across town, after saving the undercover cop, the Human Torch decides that he wants to be 'one of the good guys' and approaches a police station to join the force.</p><h3>Part Three</h3><p>This issue begins in the summer of 1940, in Greenwich Village, where a woman named Miss Portnoy is asking the private investigator <a href=\"/ferret/4005-47134/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47134\">Ferret</a> to find her mother (the cleaner whom Hamilton killed). In uptown Manhattan, a general visits Professor Hamilton and tells him that he's been selected for a new robotics project. Meanwhile, in a secret air base in England, Fury meets with Sawyer for the first time since Erskine, and Sawyer tells him that he needs Fury and Hargrove for another mission. Erskine has divulged the secret locations of where his former colleagues are, and Sawyer wants Fury and the Sky Devils to destroy the bases. Back in New York, the Human Torch has been working as Officer Jim Hammond, and it is a job that he prides himself in. But his supervisor tells him to take a day off, and when the Torch asks him what he should do, his supervisor tells him to go to <a href=\"/coney-island/4020-56617/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56617\">Coney Island</a>. While all of this is going on, the Angel is still continuing his search for the Phantom Bullet's killer, and learns that he was killed because he tried to stop a smuggling operation.</p><p>In the seas, Namor follows the trail of a merchant ship that's heading for New York, and arrives at the shores of Coney Island. After witnessing the deaths of his people; seeing the happy families in Coney Island throws him into a rage, and he begins attacking the theme park. The Prince of Atlantis attempts to tear up the tracks of a rollercoaster, before the Human Torch suddenly emerges in his blazing fiery form and saves them. The Human Torch and Namor quickly break out in an aerial brawl, and the Torch manages to blast Namor back into the ocean, defeating him. In the voiceover narration, the Angel notes that this was the day that the American people no longer viewed the Torch as a threat - but rather, as a hero.</p><p>In a US military base somewhere, <a href=\"/general-phillips/4005-43985/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43985\">General Phillips</a> meets with Kermit as they discuss the new <a href=\"/electro/4005-47069/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47069\">Electro</a> robot being built by <a href=\"/professor-philo-zog/4005-69250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69250\">Professor Zogolowski</a>. Somewhere outside Frankfurt, the Sky Devils begin bombing the German bases where Erskine's former colleague Bruder is, and during the chaos, John Steele breaks free of his cage. Meanwhile, back in America, Erskine begins concocting the formula that will change the course of the war - the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\">Super-Soldier Serum</a>.</p><h3>Part Four</h3><p>In New York, Major Kerfoot meets with a newly-arrived Nazi spy - <a href=\"/heinz-kruger/4005-68691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68691\">Heinz Kruger.</a> Kerfoot gives Kruger his new identity as 'Frederick Clemson', a special agent for the Foreign Affairs ministry, then tells him that as soon as Kerfoot has procured a sample of the Super-Soldier Serum, Kruger is to kill Erskine. As Kruger begins to leave, we see that Ferret has been following them all along. But Kermit's handler cuts the Ferret's investigation short, when he stabs him to death. The handler tells Kruger to get to the safe house while he searches the Ferret's office to learn how much he knows. At the safe house, Kruger studies a file on the test subject that the Americans have chosen for Erskine's formula: <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Steve Rogers</a>. Kruger reads through his dossier, learning that Rogers was a sickly orphan and an artistic type, who despite his frailty wanted nothing more than to serve his country. General Phillips then offered Rogers the opportunity to be the formula's first test subject, but warned him that there was a good chance he won't survive.</p><p>In the city, the Angel finds the stabbed body of the Ferret and retrieves the Ferret's pet ferret - Nosie. Meanwhile, the Ferret's office had been set on fire by Kruger's handler. Back in Nazi-occupied France, Private John Steele takes down a group of Nazi soldiers - having spent the last few months reacquainting himself with the world. Some thankful villagers offer him a change of clothes and a meal, and when night falls, Steele leaves and stumbles across the Sky Devils' bomber plane in the forest. There, he meets Fury, Hargrove, and the rest of them, and the two parties make an alliance.</p><p>Back in New York, a week after Kruger's arrival, the Nazi spy meets with his handler again. Kruger tells his handler that it is difficult to assassinate Erskine, as he is always surrounded by others. His handler then tells Kruger that Kerfoot has already succeeded in copying Erskine's formula, but that Kerfoot believes that Erskine left out a few crucial parts. The handler then tells Kruger that tomorrow is the day that they plan to test the Super-Soldier Serum, and that Erskine has to be killed at all costs. That night, Kruger writes a letter to his wife Elise that will never be mailed.</p><p>The next day, Kruger makes his way into the secret facility where the final test of the Serum will take place.</p><h3>Part Five</h3><p>Steve Rogers drinks the Super-Soldier Serum, before being bombarded by Vita-Rays, and the rest is history. But just as Rogers successfully becomes America's first Super-Soldier, Heinz Kruger shoots Dr. Erskine. In an uncontrolled rage, Rogers grabs Kruger and hurls him aside - but misjudging his new strength - he accidentally throws Kruger to one of the Vita-Ray conduits, shocking the Nazi spy and killing him. With Dr. Erskine's death, the Super-Soldier Serum becomes forever lost. Rogers is the only one of his kind, and after being trained by various teachers on combat and tactics, a soldier tells him that General Phillips wants to see him.</p><p>Elsewhere in New York, Major Kerfoot has fled his apartment just after government agents broke into it. With Erskine's death and the revelation of Kruger as a spy, the government is cracking down on any possible infiltrations. Kerfoot has also faked his own death via a car bomb, but he remains paranoid. He then receives a visit from his handler, who tells him that the incomplete Serum formula that Kerfoot copied is already in Berlin. His handler then proceeds to kill Kerfoot, and then he tells his subordinates to retrieve all of Kerfoot's books and get rid of his body. Meanwhile, the Angel meets with a newsman from the Bugle, Kellerman, who tells him that Erskine was killed by a Nazi spy - and that Hitler has his own costumed soldier now.</p><p>In Nazi-occupied France, the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> lines up a group of innocent villagers. One woman pleads with the Red Skull, telling him that they're not Resistance, but the Red Skull says he doesn't care - he's just here to make a point. He guns them all down. He then asks the remaining villagers where the American and British fighters are, and states that people has seen them hiding in the village. When the villagers continue insisting that they know nothing, Red Skull tells his men to separate the children, and line them up along the wall. Days later, John Steele and Nick Fury enter the very same village where the Skull's massacre took place. Fury tells Steele that he has been recalled by Sawyer back to the States, and Steele says that he'll remain in France in his hunt for the Red Skull.</p><p>In a Nazi base just outside of Berlin, Bruder is talking to another scientist named Burstein. Bruder tells Burstein that they're still nowhere near cracking Erskine's formula. Back in New York, Steve Rogers puts on the uniform that President Roosevelt assigned to him as a response to the Red Skull. And while the Angel is at a local wharf, tracking down some Nazi spies, he witnesses the very first appearance of Captain America. The Super-Soldier breaks into the spies' warehouse, easily dispatching the Nazi infiltrators. Their handler (who was also Kruger and Kermit's handler) makes an escape, and Angel tries to stop him, but the handler fires back with a Thompson submachine-gun. Captain America manages to shield the Angel, but a loose round strikes Dr. Halloway's thigh. As the handler flees, the Angel tells Captain America that he's fine and they exchange stories. The Angel then tells Captain America to go after the handler, and asks him for his name. Captain America tells him, and then heads off.</p><h3>Part Six</h3><p>In the summer of 1941, Namor walks the streets of New York in disguise, in search of the Human Torch. The Torch is now accepted as a hero of the people, and spends his days stopping costumed crooks, but remains conflicted about his humanity. Returning to the laboratory in Brooklyn where he was made, the Torch finds a picture of Professor Horton and his assistant, and goes searching for the assistant - Fred Raymond. Traveling to Raymond's home in Staten Island, he meets the Professor' subordinate there, but Raymond tells him to leave. Raymond explains that if the government learns that Torch was in his home, they'd take him away from his sick wife for investigation. But just as the Torch is about to depart, they hear a cry coming from Raymond's wife's room, and step in to see their son <a href=\"/toro/4005-11835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11835\">Toro</a> erupt into flame. Raymond thinks that the Torch has something to do with it and chases him out of the house. In confusion and fear, the Human Torch quickly flies off into the skies.</p><p>Back in Nazi Germany, John Steele's search for the Red Skull finally ends when he finds him at a research facility. Inside the facility, the Red Skull arrests Professor Eric Schmitt because his mother was Jewish. As he is dragged away, Skull asks Bruder if his experiments can continue without Schmitt's help, and Bruder says that it's no problem. While the Nazi soldiers drag Schmitt for transportation to the concentration camps, Steele sneaks into the facility via a ventilation grill. Traveling through the ventilation pathways, he spies the Red Skull talking to Bruder and a mysterious man draped in a hat and jacket. The mysterious man removes his clothing to reveal his identity as an Atlantean named <a href=\"/u-man/4005-29530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29530\">Meranno</a>. It is then revealed that Meranno has made a deal with Nazi Germany; and that he was the one who informed the Germans of where they could find Atlanteans (the depth-charges from Part One).</p><p>Back in America, the Torch remains conflicted and wonders why Toro also gained fiery powers similar to his own. But as he soars through the air, Namor suddenly attacks him. The two of them have another aerial brawl just as Namor summons a massive tidal wave to consume New York. Mass casualties occur immediately when the water consumes the city. But in the chaos, New York's hero community experiences their first call-to-arms as all of its heroes gather together to save the drowning innocent. The Angel, <a href=\"/thin-man/4005-35726/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35726\">Thin Man</a>, Electro, <a href=\"/patriot/4005-44588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44588\">Patriot</a>, and the Hurricane, along with many others, all make appearances. But the battle in the skies between Namor and the Torch comes to an abrupt end when Captain America appears. With a single blow from the Captain's disc shield, Namor is knocked out, and collapses back onto the ground in defeat.</p><h3>Part Seven</h3><p>As winter arrives, Namor is imprisoned inside the US Capitol. A US officer tells Captain America that Namor hasn't said anything and that they assume that he's some sort of foreign super-soldier. Across the ocean, in a concentration camp, Professor Schmitt concocts a formula similar to Erskine's. He gives it to a British spy named Brian Falsworth, whose cover had been blown, and the serum gives Falsworth superhuman powers. But the change is painful, causing Falsworth to groan and struggle, and this draws the attention of the camp's guards. Though Falsworth is able to overpower the guards with his powers, a stray bullet from the soldiers kills Schmitt. Fleeing the camp with Professor Schmitt's body, Falsworth runs into a nearby forest and buries his friend there. From that point onwards, he becomes the <a href=\"/destroyer-marlow/4005-7942/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7942\">Destroyer</a> - the world's second chemically-created super-soldier.</p><p>In France, Steele is still continuing his mission of following the Skull, and finds the Red Skull meeting <a href=\"/imperial-japanese-army/4060-56574/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56574\">Japanese</a> officers in a Nazi castle. Sneaking around, Steele manages to find a document that reveals their plans of attack against <a href=\"/washington-dc/4020-55685/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55685\">Washington</a> and <a href=\"/hawaii/4020-56180/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56180\">Hawaii</a>. The Axis' plan is a preemptive strike before America enters the war, and Steele knows that this two-pronged attack had to be stopped. Hijacking a Nazi car, he begins his journey back to America to warn his countrymen about the enemy's plans. Back in the USA, Toro's parents were killed in a train crash (which he survived thanks to his powers), and the Human Torch has taken him in as a protege. Captain America had also taken in his own sidekick, in the form of <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Angel continued following his leads and tracks down the handler and his men to a secret meeting at a beach just north of the city. But when there, the Angel is shocked to see that the handler is meeting with Meranno (now in his U-Man guise) as well as Meranno's rogue Atlanteans. U-Man asks the handler for the documents that he requires, and just as the Angel is about to stop them, Captain America and Bucky emerge. A fight breaks out, and the three heroes manage to knock out the Nazi spies and the rogue Atlanteans. U-Man tackles Captain America, but the Captain is able to fight him off, giving an opening for Bucky to shoot him. Realizing that he's lost, U-Man flees off to the seas. Bucky continues training his rifle at the ocean, waiting for U-Man to pop back up, but the Angel tells him that he shouldn't bother. The Angel then displays the documents that he found on the spy handler, which has notes about an 'undersea city' that the Nazis have made a pact with. Captain America then takes in one of the rogue Atlanteans for interrogation.</p><h3>Part Eight</h3><p>The final chapter of the Marvels Project begins with the Human Torch and Toro flying as fast as they can for the Hawaiian Islands. Earlier on, Namor had begun interrogating the Atlantean rogue that Captain America had captured, and the prisoner reveals that Meranno betrayed <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a> to the Nazis. He reveals that it was Meranno who made a deal with Nazis because of his hatred for Namor, and that it was Meranno who led the surface-dwellers to the Atlanteans. As Namor slowly realizes the error of his ways, the rogue Atlantean then reveals the secret plans that the Nazis and Meranno have to attack the United States. At the same moment, John Steele reached the French Resistance and gives the same news back Stateside. His message reaches Sawyer, who then calls for Colonel Phillips.</p><p>In the next morning, Captain America meets with the Human Torch atop the <a href=\"/empire-state-building/4020-57381/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57381\">Empire State Building</a> and briefs him on the enemy's plans. The Nazis and a contingent of Atlanteans will attack D.C., while the Japanese move for Hawaii. Captain America then tells Torch that Churchill is meeting Roosevelt tomorrow in secret, and states that he believes that this meeting is the target of the Nazi attack. Captain America then tells Torch that he needs him in Hawaii - as they need eyes in the sky to stop enemy bombs. But as the story goes back to the present, the Human Torch and Toro realize that it's not just bombs that they have to contend with, but an entire fleet of bombers.</p><p>Back in Washington, Captain America, Namor, and Bucky are escorting the British PM by air when they come under attack by Atlantean airships. Churchill lands safely, while U-Man and his army emerge from the waters. Namor immediately tackles him while Captain America starts fighting the rogue Atlanteans. Two battles take place on two fronts, but while Captain America and Namor successfully defend Churchill and defeat the rogue Atlanteans, Torch and Toro fail to completely stop the Japanese incursion. It is later revealed that Captain America chose to keep the fight in Washington secret - in honor of all the men who sacrificed their lives in Pearl Harbor. And out of respect to the ordinary American soldiers, who didn't have science on their side like he did.</p><p>In the story arc's epilogue, we see Roosevelt form the <a href=\"/invaders/4060-25865/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25865\">Invaders</a> and he pardons Namor on the condition that the Prince of Atlantis join the team. We also learn that Hargrove died in Pearl Harbor, and that Fury went on to lead the Howling Commandos. And also that John Steele mysteriously vanished some time after the invasion of Normandy. Back in New York, the Angel realizes that this is the start of the era that Matt Hawkins was talking about, the era of the Marvels.</p><p>In the present day, Steve Rogers meets with <a href=\"/jason-halloway/4005-74342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74342\">Jason Halloway</a> - the grandson of the Angel - who is also a doctor. Steve hands him a box and then leaves. Outside, Steve meets with Matt Hawkins, who as it turns out - really traveled to the future. Inside, Jason Halloway opens the case to find the revolvers and mask that both the Two-Gun Kid and the Angel used, and finds a document written by the Angel entitled 'The Marvels Project: The Early Days &amp; the Age of Heroes'. He begins reading it.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-marvels-project-birth-of-the-super-heroes-the-marvels-project-birth-of-the-super-heroes/4000-229215/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-229215\">The Marvels Project: Birth of the Super Heroes #1: The Marvels Project: Birth of the Super Heroes</a></li></ul>",

Outmatched, Tom then decides to find other bearers of the Artifacts to again try and confront Jackie, but Jackie has problems of his own. While Judge searches for other Artifact bearers, Jackie purges the Darkness from his body, creating what is essentially a doppelganger of himself made out of pure Darkness. Jackie's doppelganger begins to slowly take over Jackie's life, influencing the troubled mine of his wife Jenny, and nurturing Hope's growing Darkness powers, which are manifesting due to not having the balance of the Witchblade as her mother. It all cumulates to the doppelganger overpowering the real Jackie, and locking him in a bunker, powerless and helpless.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Zero Year is an eleven part story arc in the Batman comic book, written by Scott Snyder and penciled by Greg Capullo, which tells the untold tale of an inexperienced Bruce Wayne's formative years in his war on crime, before honing his craft and establishing himself as The Batman. Someone said</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In this story, a young Bruce Wayne attempts to save Gotham City from the murderous group known as the Red Hood Gang. However, since Bruce has yet to establish a reputation in the criminal underworld, and has yet to turn himself into the fearsome figure of Batman, he has been having a hard time winning his war. His inexperience, carelessness and uncontrolled anger have not only stalled his mission but also strained his relationship with his faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bruce's uncle, Philip Kane, who had declared Bruce legally dead during his absence from Gotham, has taken control of Wayne Enterprises and is using it to produce weapons. In an attempt to improve the company's public image, Philip attempts to convince Bruce to take control of his family's company, but Bruce refuses, as has no interest in living as \"Bruce Wayne\", focusing all his attention on his war on crime. To make matters worse, the Red Hood gang is stealing the weapons produced by the company to further terrorize the city. Phil's leading strategist, Edward Nygma, the future Riddler, advises Phil to kill Bruce in order to solve their problems but Philip refuses and still tries to convince Bruce to lead the company.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For weeks, while keeping his identity a secret using sophisticated technology, Bruce has been hunting down the Red Hood Gang and sabotages several of their operations, but is unable to take them down. The gang is getting stronger and stronger, equipping themselves with Wayne Tech and causing several random acts of violence throughout the city. However, following a surprise party for Bruce by his uncle, the Red Hood Gang, thanks to a tip from Nygma, ambush Bruce and give him a vicious beating. Bruce barely makes it back to the manor where he is nursed back to health by Alfred. Enraged by Nygma's actions, Philip attempts to kill the villain, admitting that Bruce is a better man than both of them, but Riddler incapacitates Philip and ends their alliance.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bruce comes to terms with the fact that he is losing this war and asks his father for guidance. Then a bat crashes through his window, and Bruce finally decides that he will become a Bat.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Finally realizing his purpose, Bruce and Alfred set up their base in a cave under Wayne Manor, and Bruce sets off to strike fear in the hearts of criminals as a vigilante who the press calls Batman. He starts by methodically taking out members of the Red Hood gang, quickly establishing his reputation and finally getting the attention of Red Hood One. While investigating the gang's operations, eventually, with some help from a guilt ridden Phillip, who was forced into becoming a member of the gang, Bruce discovers that the Red Hood gang are planning to use a dangerous toxin from the Ace Chemical factory to terrorize the city. He holds a press conference in front of the factory and exposes the gang's plans, forcing them to invade the factory right away. As Batman, Bruce fights off the Red Hood gang, but not without the death of Uncle Philip, who was killed by the leader for attempting to stop him. As the GCPD round up members of the gang, the factory burns down and Batman goes after the leader, preventing him from escaping and defeating him, but despite Bruce's efforts to save him, the Red Hood allows himself to fall into a large acid container.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the aftermath, Batman continues setting up his Bat-Cave and establishing himself as a hero in Gotham. Edward Nygma, now calling himself The Riddler, then makes his presence known and knocks out all power from the city, in an attempt to challenge the people to get smarter.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the massive blackout, a heavy storm comes and the city falls into chaos, and Comissioner Loeb makes it the GCPD's priority to take down the Batman, but to no avail, as the hero repeadetly evades them. Bruce is determined to make an enemy out of the police because he sees them as corrupt and untrustworthy, especially James Gordon, who seems to have a connection to the Waynes' deaths and Bruce resents him for it. Bruce is also working on a jammer, because he feels that, even if the police manage to get the power back, they'll only fall into Riddler's trap and another blackout will take place.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During this time, a series of suspicious murders have taken place, the victims, who were scientists working for Wayne Enterprises, had been ripped apart from the inside after their bones radically grew out of their body. Bruce investigates these murders and he is eventually led to Doctor Karl Helfern, a former Wayne Enterprises scientist who developed the formula that causes these effects. Bruce decides to visit the only man who may know something about it, Lucius Fox, an engineer who used to work for Bruce's father but was fired by Philip. Fox reveals that Helfern was working on a serum that was supposed to harden bones for protection against trauma, but it became unstable, and so was Helfern. However, Fox reveals that it was also his project and injects Bruce with something that incapacitated him, thus apparently revealing himself as an ally of Helfern, who is now known as Doctor Death.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bruce is kidnapped by Doctor Death, who has apparently injected himself with his own serum but instead of killing him, it has turned into a monstrous figure and becomes even more unstable. He almost kills Fox, but Bruce manages to fight him off. Lucius apologizes for the injection and reveals that it was actually a vaccine against Helfern's serum. As the two try to make their escape, Doctor Death catches up to them, now having become even more monstrous, and almost kills Bruce if it wasn't for the timely intervention of Gordon, who shoots Helfern and knocks him out of the building.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bruce is brought to a hospital where he is confronted by Gordon who wants to help Wayne and seeks get more information about the killed scientists. However, Bruce does not like Gordon because he believes that, before his parents' deaths, Gordon and his partner, Corrigan, once escorted Bruce, who believes to have seen them take bribes from the neighbourhood. Bruce declares that Gordon and the rest of the police are crooked and that he will never trust them.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3><strong><ins>Bruce Wayne In: </ins></strong></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the age of nineteen in Rio De Janeiro, Bruce met a criminal by the name of Don Miguel who taught Bruce high speed driving and several insane driving tricks including color cover, crowd ducking among others. In their final lesson, however, Bruce was instructed to lose the Policia in a bright red custom made convertible car. After an intense car chase, Miguel attempted to kill the cops using a dangerous, but Bruce, having learned everything he needed from the criminal and wanting to prevent him from causing anymore damage, crashes the car, trapping Miguel before finally knocking him out and leaving him to be apprehended by authorities.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the age of twenty one, in Egypt, Bruce seeks out an old Russian scientist named Sergei to teach him what they call the impossible. He challenges him to test by trapping him under the Sphinx, where he has limited supplies and oxygen. Bruce spends six months preparing for this test, tinkering with tools and planning for every scenario in order to survive, but Sergei tells him that he needs to go beyond planning and what is called possible in order to survive. Indeed, once Bruce is actually trapped, most of his preparations weren't operational and he was forced to go beyond what he thought is possible in order to escape and pass Sergei's test.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the age of twenty four, Bruce found himself in the middle of a pit in the Northeast of Harstad, Norway, fighting for twenty-eight hours straight in death match, defeating every fighter to challenge him but avoided killing anyone despite the insistence of the Pit Queen. Bruce came to this pit seeking to use his body to wage war, but the Queen claims that he cannot win this war without killing, and he will continue to fight until he dies. However, Bruce persists, winning battle after battle but without killing anyone, and in the end, there were no more fighters to challenge because they were all afraid of him.</p><h3><ins><strong>Secret City:</strong></ins></h3><figure style=\"width: 600px\" data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322183-bruce+wayne+12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322183\" data-ratio=\"0.5\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322183-bruce+wayne+12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322183\"><img alt=\"Bruce's disguise is blown\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3322183-bruce+wayne+12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322183-bruce+wayne+12.jpg 600w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/3322183-bruce+wayne+12.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3322183-bruce+wayne+12.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Bruce's disguise is blown</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The story starts six years ago, having recently returned to Gotham City after travelling the world, Bruce Wayne decides to use the skills he learned abroad to cleanse his city of crime, his first target being the Red Hood Gang, a growing group of criminals made up of middle and upper class gothamites who were convinced or blackmailed into joining the group by the leader, whose identity still remains a mystery to Bruce, as he never takes off his mask, not even in front of his crew. Using a disguise, Bruce infiltrated the group but his cover was eventually blown, and he was cornered by the gang. Though he managed to escape and save the hostages held by the gang, this encounter showed Bruce's carelessness and lack of discipline that almost jeopardized the entire mission.</p><figure style=\"width: 181px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3323733-riddler+2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3323733\" data-ratio=\"1.5359116022099\" data-width=\"181\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3323733-riddler+2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3323733\"><img alt=\"Edward Nygma\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3323733-riddler+2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3323733-riddler+2.jpg 181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 181px) 100vw, 181px\" data-width=\"181\"></a><figcaption>Edward Nygma</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Back at his base, Bruce's faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth, who is heavily against Bruce's crusade, tries to talk some sense into him and attempts to convince Bruce to announce his return to the city, but Bruce says that he wants to remain legally dead as he feels that he's more efficient that way in his war and he doesn't not want to be distracted by \"Bruce Wayne\". On his way out of the manor, Bruce is met by his uncle Philip Kane, much to Alfred's dismay, who reveals that he was the one who declared Bruce legally dead so he could re-built Wayne Enterprises into something new, by merging it with Kane Chemicals, becoming a leader in protective technology, specializing in weapons. Bruce disapproves of what his uncle has done with the company, and despite Philip's attempts to convince Bruce to take control of the company, he refuses because that's not what he's here to do and it's not who he is. Later that night, while meeting with an associate, Philip reveals that he wants Bruce to lead the company to improve the company's public image since they are hated for building weapons, and to make matters worse, the Red Hood Gang is stealing those weapons from them. The associate, who is revealed to be none other than Edward Nygma, tells him that the solution to Philip's problems, or Riddle as Edward calls it, is simple: killing Bruce Wayne.</p><figure style=\"width: 650px\" data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3323740\" data-ratio=\"0.44153846153846\" data-width=\"650\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3323740\"><img alt=\"The Red Hood Gang strikes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg 650w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Red Hood Gang strikes\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg 650w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3323740-red+hood+gang+2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Red Hood Gang strikes</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Red Hood Gang hijack Luca Falcone's blimp, as part of their plan to take over all other gang in Gotham. After the leader, Red Hood One, throws Falcone off the blimp, he gloats to his captive, who appears to be Oswald Cobblepot, about having acquired all the drugs, information and advanced weaponry, including a Wayne Sonic Rifle. Then suddenly, \"Cobblepot\" attacks Red Hood One and reaches for his hood, but gets electrocuted. The Hood then deduces that this is in fact the vigilante who has been giving them trouble for the last few weeks. It was in fact, Bruce, having kidnapped the real Cobblepot and trapped him in the blimp's basement, disguised as the villain, in another attempt to take down the gang. Impressed, the Red Hood leader offers Bruce a spot on his team, claiming that they are two of a kind, but Bruce refuses and manages to take down some of the Hood's men, and even stabs the leader with his gauntlet, thereby getting a sample of his DNA. Bruce barely manages to escape unscathed, with the real Cobblepot with him.</p><figure style=\"width: 230px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322225-batman+%26+alfred+4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322225\" data-ratio=\"0.95217391304348\" data-width=\"230\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322225-batman+%26+alfred+4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322225\"><img alt=\"Alfred slaps Bruce\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" data-width=\"230\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322225-batman+%26+alfred+4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322225-batman+%26+alfred+4.jpg 230w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Alfred slaps Bruce\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322225-batman+%26+alfred+4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322225-batman+%26+alfred+4.jpg 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" data-width=\"230\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alfred slaps Bruce</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Back at the manor, Bruce is still upset by the fact that he's still losing this war, as the leader's DNA has no match in any records, and he is still unable to stop this gang while it's quickly growing and becoming more dangerous. Alfred tells Bruce that his war is doomed and disapproves of the way in which he is fighting it. At Bruce's insistence, Alfred tells him that fighting from the shadows as a ghost is cowardly, unlike his parents, who fought for their city in public. He also disapproves of the fact that he is letting the Wayne name rot and leaving Wayne Enterprises in the hands of his uncle, who he sees as a sad, angry man with no purpose but glory. A heated argument breaks out between the two, as Alfred claims that Bruce's parents would be ashamed while Bruce tells him that's the real coward, provoking Alfred to slap Bruce in the face, before heading back to the manor.</p><figure style=\"width: 562px\" data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322213-bruce+wayne+10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322213\" data-ratio=\"1.0604982206406\" data-width=\"562\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322213-bruce+wayne+10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322213\"><img alt=\"Bruce Wayne vs Edward Nygma\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" data-width=\"603\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322213-bruce+wayne+10.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322213-bruce+wayne+10.jpg 562w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bruce Wayne vs Edward Nygma\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322213-bruce+wayne+10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322213-bruce+wayne+10.jpg 562w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" data-width=\"603\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bruce Wayne vs Edward Nygma</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the argument, Bruce meets up with Philip at the Museum and tells him to shut down his operation because gangs have been steeling tech from Wayne Enterprises. Philip is reluctant and again tries to convince Bruce to be part of the company so they can things out, but Bruce turns him down again and insists that Bruce Wayne should stay dead. Philip then turns on the lights and reveals Welcoming Partym thereby revealing his return to the city. Bruce angrily storms off and while searching for the Museum's exit, he encounters Edward Nygma. During their conversation, Nygma implies to Bruce that his uncle is giving weapons away to the Red Hood in an attempt keep them away from bigger ones, but refuses to say anymore. After solving Nygma's riddle concerning the Museum's exit, Bruce tells Edward on his way out to try harder next time, to which Edward mutters that there won't be a next time. As he reaches the manor, he is caught in an explosion set up by the Red Hood.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><figure style=\"width: 181px\" data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322187-bruce+wayne+16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322187\" data-ratio=\"1.5359116022099\" data-width=\"181\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322187-bruce+wayne+16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322187\"><img alt=\"Under the mercy of the Red Hood\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 181px) 100vw, 181px\" data-width=\"181\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322187-bruce+wayne+16.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322187-bruce+wayne+16.jpg 181w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Under the mercy of the Red Hood\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322187-bruce+wayne+16.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322187-bruce+wayne+16.jpg 181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 181px) 100vw, 181px\" data-width=\"181\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Under the mercy of the Red Hood</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bruce is then ambushed by the Red Hood Gang, who give him a vicious beating. The Red Hood reveals that the death of Bruce's parents changed his own life as well. The fact that the Waynes, scions of the city, were randomly killed by a nobody for no reason, inspired what the Red Hood gang is all about, acts of randomness inspiring madness, fear and survival. He also reveals that there is another man, like Bruce, who has been fighting them, but promises that, in the end, they will get him just like they got Bruce. Before leaving Bruce to die, the Red Hood thanks Bruce for leaving that theater with his parents that night, because it inspired him and then proceeds to takes down down the Waynes portraits and puts two bullets through them. Severely wounded, Bruce barely manages to make his way to the lower levels of the Manor before passing out.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile, it is revealed that Edward Nygma was the one who sent the gang after Bruce, and Philip, enraged by actions, threatens to kill him. However, Nygma says a password that activates the magnetic plate in Philip's head, which was placed there after a childhood accident, causing Philip to collapse and to be incapacitated. Nygma announces his resignation and leaves Philip laying on the floor in pain, but not before Philip taunts him with the fact that despite all his strategies, he's nothing more than a shadow, an empty question mark and that no one will know who he is. Edward simply pauses and tells him goodbye.</p><figure style=\"width: 624px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322180-bruce+wayne+8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322180\" data-ratio=\"1.5384615384615\" data-width=\"624\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322180-bruce+wayne+8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3322180\"><img alt=\"The moment of truth\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3322180-bruce+wayne+8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322180-bruce+wayne+8.jpg 624w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3322180-bruce+wayne+8.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The moment of truth\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3322180-bruce+wayne+8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/3322180-bruce+wayne+8.jpg 624w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/3322180-bruce+wayne+8.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The moment of truth</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bruce is found by Alfred and was nursed back to health. Alfred tells Bruce that despite their differences, he promises that he will always be there to patch him up. Bruce simply taps him on the shoulder as a sign of gratitude. Bruce then wanders the mansion, distraught at the fact that he is unable to win this war, and then faces a statue of his father, asking for guidance. Remembering the traumatic event as a child when he fell into a pit near Wayne Manor, before he was saved by his father, he was attacked by a swarm of bats. His father once told him the lifeblood of Gotham runs under Wayne Manor, and asks him what the city told him to be. Just then, a bat crashes through the window and lands on Thomas Wayne's statue. Bruce replies \"Yes I see. Yes Father. I shall become a bat.\"</p><h3><ins><strong>Dark City</strong></ins></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Finally realizing his purpose, Bruce and Alfred set up their base in a cave under Wayne Manor, and Bruce sets off to strike fear in the hearts of criminals as Batman. He starts by methodically taking out members of the Red Hood gang, quickly establishing his reputation and finally getting the attention of Red Hood One. Following the gang's heists, Bruce sees no patterns, as all their acts are random, and decides that he needs help from his uncle. Philip is extremely regretful of what happened and reveals that he has been marked by the gang and forced to become a member himself. He gives Bruce access to the system which allows Bruce to realize what the gang's plan is, when and where they are planning on executing it. On the anniversary of the Waynes' murders, the gang is planning on forming a deadly poison using material obtained from the Ace Chemical factory, and exploding at several different locations around the city. Bruce realizes that this is a job for Bruce Wayne, not Batman, so he holds a press conference the day before the scheduled execution of the plan, outside the Chemical factory, to officially announcing his return to Gotham City. He goes on to explain why he came back despite what happened to his parents, because Gotham city, despite its flaws, is transformative and challenges everyone to be the best person they can be. He exposes the Red Hood Gang's plans and encourages the people of Gotham to fight back against this menace. Before he could finish however, the gang launch their attack in an attempt to kill Bruce, but he is saved by Lieutenant James Gordon.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the confusion, Bruce sneaks into the factory during while Gordon attempts to lead a group of cops through the front door. Inside, Bruce is confronted by Red Hood One, who is impressed by Bruce's efforts but tells him that the cycle of randomness opened with his parents' murder and it will close with his death, and the destruction of the factory with the police inside while the gang escapes through the back entrance with what is available of their toxin, which they will unleash on the city the next day, opening a new cycle. But Bruce tells him that his parent's death may have been random and meaningless but their lives weren't, and he tells Red Hood that his life is an abomination and he is nothing more than an evil man pretending to have a purpose.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Just before the leader can pull the trigger, a massive outage takes place in the entire neighbourhood, thanks to Alfred, and in a masterfully executed facade give the illusion that Batman appeared to save Bruce. The light then go back on, and Bruce, now suited up, as Batman, appears and engages the gang in combat and gains the upper hand while Alfred shuts down the bay doors to prevent the gang from escaping. After defeating most of the gang, Batman is almost shot by Red Hood One, but he is saved by a member of the gang, who is then shot and killed in retaliation by the leader. To Batman's horror, it is revealed to be his very own uncle Philip who was forced into joining the gang. As the place starts to go on fire, Gordon and the police enter the factory and confront Batman, who manages to evade them to go after the fleeing leader. As the police round up the incapacitated members of the gang, on the rooftop, Red Hood attempts to make his escape using a helicopter but Batman grapples onto him and they both plummet into the burning factory. They engage in combat and Batman finally defeats the Red Hood but the railing they were standing collapses. Batman extends his hand and tries to save his enemy but the Red Hood refuses and declares that this is just the beginning before allowing himself to fall into the acid below.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the aftermath, Bruce and Alfred finish setting up the Bat Cave, and they finally reconcile, with Alfred telling Bruce that his parents would have been proud of him and that Batman's legend begins with him saving Bruce Wayne thus cementing their separation into his legacy. Though Bruce has doubts that his identity will be uncovered, Alfred reassures him that if plays his role right, the people won't want to know who is behind the mask, because Batman can be something they can believe in, that can transport them to a world where anything is possible. Just then, Edward Nygma, now calling himself the Riddler, makes his presence known on a giant screen, and announces his plan to make the people of Gotham smarter, challenging them to a riddle, and then proceeds knock out all power from the city, leaving Gotham under a massive blackout.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-zero-year-secret-city-1-volume-4/4000-452296/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-452296\">Batman: Zero Year - Secret City</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-year-zero-dark-city-1-volume-5/4000-468049/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-468049\">Batman: Zero Year - Dark City</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/dc-comics-zero-year/4050-77803/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-77803\">DC Comics: Zero Year</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-26/4000-497780/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-497780\">Batman #26</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-27/4000-497781/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-497781\">Batman #27</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-28/4000-497832/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-497832\">Batman #28</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-29/4000-497834/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-497834\">Batman #29</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-30/4000-497835/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-497835\">Batman #30</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-31/4000-497836/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-497836\">Batman #31</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-32/4000-497837/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-497837\">Batman #32</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-33/4000-497838/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-497838\">Batman #33</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-34/4000-497839/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-497839\">Batman #34</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/flash-6/4000-505112/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-505112\">Flash #6</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"/green-lantern-28/4000-505167/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-505167\">Green Lantern #28 </a>(German)</li></ul>",
