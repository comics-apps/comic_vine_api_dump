Earth's Mightiest Heroes learn not only of the intergalactic war taking place but that their solar system is being used as a strategic hyperspace stop and it is severely destabilizing their sun.</p><p>The east coast branch of the Avengers unite with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\" href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\">Avengers West Coast</a> and divide into three teams. One team remains on Earth while the other two journey to the respective throneworlds of the Shi'ar and Kree to find some way of protecting Earth from this war.

    "deck": "The Joker tries to turn Commissioner Gordon crazy through a series of devised methods, proving that anyone can have a bad day. By Alan Moore and Brian Bolland.",
    "description": "<p>One night Batman goes to visit the Joker in Arkham Asylum. While contemplating the futility of their relationship, and that it will only result in either his or the Joker's death in the future, he discovers that the Joker sitting before him is not actually the Joker, but an impostor. Batman threatens the imposter, and asks his infamous question \"Where is he?!\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the Joker is looking to buy a run-down old theme park for then unknown reasons. Through flashbacks, Moore reveals parts of the Joker's past, and shows he had a significant other named Jeannie who was pregnant with his child. Joker kills the owner of the theme park with his <a data-ref-id=\"4015-50669\" href=\"/joker-venom/4015-50669/\" slug=\"joker-venom\">joker venom</a> (the same one that made him the way he is) and makes the land his own. Later, Barbara Gordon answers the door only to find the Joker on the other side. The Joker shoots Barbara and takes nude photos of her on the floor and bleeding. His goons abduct Commissioner Gordon. In another flashback we see that the Joker was a failed comedian who, out of desperation for the life of his unborn baby, joins the mob for one job and becomes the Red Hood. Barbara is later revealed to be paralyses from the waist down. Batman consoles Barbara, and she tells him that this time its different. \"The look in his eyes\" she utters, while crying.</p><p>Commissioner Gordon is stripped naked and sent through an insane carnival ride, bombarded with the nude images of his daughter in an attempt to to break his sanity. He is ridiculed and made fun off by the Joker, to an audience of carnival freaks. Another flash back shows that before the Joker could even begin the job, Jeannie had died. Distraught, he has doubts about the job, but gets bullied into going through with it anyway. When Batman ruins the job, the Joker (while trying to escape) accidentally falls into a river of chemical waste and after removing his red helmet/hood, he sees what he has become. It becomes evident that he is insane, as he is shown laughing with blood dripping from his eyes and mouth. Back in the present, after gathering clues, Batman finds his way to the carnival and proceeds to fight the Joker and free Gordon. He tries to comfort Gordon, but is told to continue in the pursuit of the Joker, and to \"bring him in by the books\". The Joker attempts to shoot Batman with what would seem to be the same gun he used to cripple Barbara Gordon. The gun turns out to be a fake and Batman lives. The Joker tells an unusual joke about two insane men, and as he laughs uncontrollably, Batman utters a solitary chuckle. The story ends as it starts pouring rain and the police show up.</p><p>Some time later, she decides to become the omniscient computer presence known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\" href=\"/oracle/4005-5368/\" slug=\"oracle\">Oracle</a>. She ends up being more useful and dangerous as the Oracle than <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1701\" href=\"/batgirl/4005-1701/\" slug=\"batgirl\">Batgirl</a>.</p><p>The Killing Joke has gained notoriety due to its labeling as a graphic novel, despite it's short length.</p><p>Tim Burton stated \"I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and The Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan - and I think it started when I was a child - is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved <i>The Killing Joke</i>, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable.\" He has stated in the past that The Killing Joke was his inspiration for his Batman movie. There is however speculation as to whether or not this is a legitimate claim as Tim Burton's depiction of the Joker was much different to the one portrayed in the Killing Joke.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-150020\" href=\"/across-the-universe-the-dc-universe-stories-of-alan-moore-dc-universe-the-stories-of-alan-moore/4000-150020/\" slug=\"across-the-universe-the-dc-universe-stories-of-alan-moore-dc-universe-the-stories-of-alan-moore\">Across the Universe: The DC Universe Stories of Alan Moore Vol. 2</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Note: This page is for the original Marvel Zombies that were introduced in Ultimate Fantastic Four and continued in the Marvel Zombies limited series. It includes the Earth-2149 zombies only, the A.R.M.O.R.'s missions as a result of the Earth-2149 zombies and spin-offs or other one-shot issues, should be linked to the <a href=\"/marvel-zombies/4015-56108/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56108\">Marvel Zombies concept</a>, and can be listed on this page under related issues.</b></i></p><h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>When the Sentry came from another dimension to that of Earth-2149, he carried an infection with him. This infection was a zombie plague, and when the Avengers of Earth-2149 arrived at the scene of the Sentry's arrival, he infected them all. Soon the Avengers would spread the plague to other heroes, and before long the entire world became either infected or devoured.</p><p>Before long though, the Marvel Zombies ran out of food. While some of the zombies such as Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Wolverine, gained the powers of Galactus, others stayed behind and used cloning technologies to continue eating. Years later, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and the others came back to Earth to find that Black Panther had survived and created a new life for the survivors of the plague. Running low on food it wouldn't be long until the hunger took over, and the zombies found a way to cross universes.</p><p>Soon the zombies came to Earth-616 resulting in the creation of A.R.M.O.R. to combat the zombie infestation. They travel between Universes to help rid them of the zombie plague and to prevent it from spreading into the Marvel Universe.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>Dead Days</h3><p>A strange lightning in the sky struck New York. There it shows a zombified Sentry infecting the Avengers. The Avengers then went around eating the citizens and infecting other heroes/villains. All remaining heroes retreat to the S.H.I.E.L.D hellicarrier to plan for an attack on the zombies. Tony Stark and Reed Richards plan for a way to solve the problem but Reed goes mad and infects the Fantastic Four having the hellicarrier become infected. Stark makes a dimensional teleporter and has the remaining heroes escort it away while he gets infected. Nick Fury then decides to destroy the teleporter so the zombies will be stuck in this universe.</p><h3>Ultimate Fantastic Four; Crossover</h3><p>It didn't take long for the zombies to eat most of the population. The zombied heroes are still hungry, so they manipulate Reed Richards from the ultimate universe to build the dimensional teleporter that Stark created. The teleporter was made but was then destroyed by Magneto to once again prevent the zombies from infecting the ultimate universe.</p><h3>Marvel Zombies 1</h3><p>Magneto destroyed the teleporter and is on the run trying to return to his base on asteroid M. Unfortunately he was found by zombie heroes and fought. Magneto put up a great fight but was defeated and eaten by zombie Captain America (now called colonel america), Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, Luke Cage, Hank Pym, Wasp, Wolverine, and Daredevil. After that they are discussing how the biology of being a zombie works which they can't figure out.They then see the Silver Surfer but disappears quickly. The group then reunites with Zombie Iron man who is angry about the group eating magneto without him. meanwhile zombie Hank Pym sneaks into a secret lab where he has a sedated Black Panther who Hank uses as a secret meal. He then amputates his leg for a meal until zombie Wasp finds Hank and asks him to split Black Panther with her. Hank then kills Wasp by biting her head off but spits it out because of bad taste. Meanwhile the group encounter the Silver Surfer again. Silver Surfer tells the zombies Galactus is coming to devour the planet but the zombie's respond by attacking him. The surfer puts up good fight by destroying Iron man's legs and burning Hulk's face. Unfortunately The Silver Surfer is defeated by the Hulk by biting his head off. So Colonel America, Spider-man, Wolverine, Hank Pym, Iron man, and Luke Cage eat the Silver Surfer and gain the surfers cosmic powers. They then show off their powers by destroying almost every other zombie. Meanwhile, Black Panther (missing an arm and a leg) escaped the lab with Wasp (now only a head) to find a group of mutants who are searching for Magneto. At first they reject T'Challa because he has zombie Wasp but later accept him and they escape to Asteroid M where Black Panther was able to get a prosthetic arm and leg from Forge. Back on Earth, Galactus has reached Earth and easily overpowers the cosmic zombies. The zombies then retreat to Hank Pym's secret lab to build a cannon that can destroy Galactus. They then fuel it with their cosmic powers and knocks Galactus unconscious. They then see a group of zombie villains going to try to eat Galactus but is easily defeated except Colonel America who was killed by zombie Red Skull. The cosmic zombies then go and eat Galactus gaining his powers. It is then shown years later and Asteroid M landed on earth. Black Panter and Wasp (now with a robotic body) find earth not inhabited by anything so they start to rebuild. Meanwhile we see a alien planet being attacked by the zombies who are now dressed like Galactus.</p><h3>Ultimate Fantastic Four; Frightful</h3><h3>Black Panther</h3><h3>Marvel Zombies 2</h3><p>Many years later the cosmic zombies (Spider-man, Wolverine, Iron man, Luke Cage, Hank Pym, Hulk) and a couple new zombies (Phoenix, Thanos, Gladiator, Firelord) ate everything in the known universe.Thanos blamed Hulk for biting more than he can chew which resulted in Hulk killing Thanos. Hank then remembered the dimensional teleporter that they can rebuild and use to find more food. So the zombies began their journey to earth. Meanwhile on earth. Black Panther (now an old man) is leader of New Wakanda and is learning that they don't have enough people to sustain a population and fears extinction, also they found the head of zombie Hawkeye who's still alive but can't remember much after being buried for so many years. Also there's a mutant resistance group that is planning to assassinate Black Panther. So that night, and assassin came and stabbed Panther in the gut fatally wounding him. Zombie Wasp comes in and incapacitates the assassin. She then sees the only way of keeping Panther alive is by turning him into a zombie. So she bites him but doing this has returned her hunger and tries to eat Black Panther's wife but Panther (now a zombie) stops her and tells her to help him eat the assassin. Panther and Wasp then go into a reinforced safe to get over the hunger. Later, Black Panther and Wasp are cured of the hunger and leave only to find the leader of the resistance group <a href=\"/malcolm-cortez/4005-48899/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48899\">Malcolm Cortez</a> rant about Panther becoming a zombie roweling up the crowd. Then the other zombies appear. Hank Pym shocked by there being some humans left suggest making a breeding program so they can eat humans forever. In an anger, Spider-man shoots the top of hank's head. Spider-man tells them they used to be heroes and they should learn to get over the hunger because Spider-man and Luke Cage already got over it. In response the rest of the zombies attack Spider-man and Luke cage. Black Panther and wasp came to assist until the people put up force field keeping the zombies out except Gladiator. Spider-man, Luke cage, Black Panther, and wasp then fought Gladiator. Gladiator was proven stronger than them combined. Forge then came wearing a new and improved Iron man armor and holds down Gladiator for Spider-man and Luke Cage to blast Gladiator's head off. The zombies outside the barrier then left to look for the teleporter. The good zombies then went into the city to get prosthetic limbs. Meanwhile the zombies finally reached Earth and head to Stark industries to look for the teleporter but are attacked by the buildings security which made Stark believe someone already came here and took the teleporter. Later, Forge showed the good zombies the teleporter and told them they better prepare for the other zombie's return. Also forge also helped even the battle by revealing Black Panther's son who has a chunk of Captain America's brain inside.The bad zombies returned and the good zombies fought them but they eventually got into the city. Hank Pym was about to eat a person until the hunger vanished in him. Hank then saw all the horrible things he did and told the other zombies to stop. The Hulk then tried eating people and all the zombies fought Hulk but Hulk killed Phoenix, Firelord, hawkeye, and Iron man. Then a man came and sacrificed himself to the hulk causing hulk to turn into banner where the zombies killed him. After all this they plan to use the teleporter to teleport the remaining humans to a different dimension until Malcolm came and teleported the zombies away making Malcolm leader of New Wakanda.</p><h3>Marvel Zombies Return</h3><h2>Chronological Order</h2><ul><li>Marvel Zombies: Dead Days</li><li><blockquote>Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness</blockquote></li><li>Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution</li><li><blockquote><span>Marvel Apes</span></blockquote></li><li>Ultimate Fantastic Four, issues 21-23 <i>(Original Appearance)</i></li><li>Marvel Zombies</li><li>Ultimate Fantastic Four, issues 30-32</li><li>Black Panther, issues 28-30</li><li>Marvel Zombies 2</li><li>Marvel Zombies Return</li><li>Marvel Zombies 3</li><li>Marvel Zombies 4</li><li><blockquote><span>Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth</span></blockquote></li><li>Marvel Zombies 5</li><li>Marvel Zombies Supreme</li><li>Marvel Zombies Destroy</li></ul><h2><span>Collected Editions</span></h2><ul><li><a href=\"/ultimate-fantastic-four-crossover/4050-22166/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22166\">Ultimate Fantastic Four: Crossover</a></li><li><a href=\"/ultimate-fantastic-four-frightful/4050-22167/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22167\">Ultimate Fantastic Four: Frightful</a></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies/4050-57825/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-57825\">Marvel Zombies</a> (#1–5)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-dead-days/4050-32703/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32703\">Marvel Zombies: Dead Days</a> (Ultimate Fantastic Four #21–23, 30–32, Marvel Zombies: Dead Days, Black Panther vol. 3 #28–30)</span></li><li><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-apes-evolution-starts-here/4050-32625/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32625\">Marvel Apes: Evolution Starts Here</a> (Collects the Marvel Apes specials)</span></span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-2/4050-32704/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32704\">Marvel Zombies 2</a> (#1-5)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-3/4050-32872/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32872\">Marvel Zombies 3</a> (#1-4)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-4/4050-32986/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32986\">Marvel Zombies 4</a> (#1-4)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-return/4050-33018/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33018\">Marvel Zombies: Return</a> (#1-5)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-5/4050-36370/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36370\">Marvel Zombies 5</a> (#1-5)</span></li><li><span><a href=\"/marvel-zomnibus/4050-57829/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-57829\">Marvel Zomnibus HC</a> (Ultimate Fantastic Four #21–23, 30–32, Marvel Zombies #1–5, Marvel Zombies: Dead Days, Black Panther vol. 3 #28–30, Marvel Apes: Prime Eight, Marvel Zombies 2 #1-5, Marvel Zombies 3 #1–4, Marvel Zombies 4 #1–4, Marvel Zombies: Return #1–5, Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution, Marvel Zombies 5 #1–5, Marvel Zombies Supreme #1–5)</span></li><li><a href=\"/black-panther-four-the-hard-way/4050-30150/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30150\">Black Panther: Four the Hard Way</a> (#26-30)</li><li><span><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-supreme/4050-43025/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-43025\">Marvel Zombies Supreme</a> (#1–5)</span></span></span></li><li>Marvel Zombies Destroy <span>(#1-5)</span> <span>*Solicited March 2013</span></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-official-handbook-of-the-marvel-universe-the-official-handbook-of-the-marvel-universe-alternate-universes-2005/4000-106689/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-106689\">The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #17</a></li><li><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-vs-army-of-darkness/4050-18236/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18236\">Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness</a> (#1–5)</span></span></li><li><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-christmas-carol/4050-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-41041\">Marvel Zombies Christmas Carol</a> (#1-5)</span></span></li><li><span><a href=\"/deadpool-merc-with-a-mouth/4050-26958/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26958\">Deadpool: Merc With a Mouth</a> (#1-13)</span></li><li><span><span><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-the-covers/4050-49830/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-49830\">Marvel Zombies: The Covers</a></span></span></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-halloween/4050-53119/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-53119\">Marvel Zombies Halloween</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-the-book-of-angels-demons-various-monstrosities/4050-19223/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19223\">Marvel Zombies: The Book of Angels, Demons &amp; Various Monstrosities</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-spotlight-marvel-zombies/4050-32096/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32096\">Marvel Spotlight Marvel Zombies</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-spotlight-marvel-zombies-return/4050-32097/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32097\">Marvel Spotlight Marvel Zombies Return</a></li></ul>",

This causes a deep rift in the hero community, with some backing the Act while others oppose it.",

Peter is to act as Tony's eyes and ears. However, things go awry and an assassination is plotted against Tony by <a href=\"/titanium-man/13823/\" data-ref-id=\"13823\">Titanium Man</a>. It is later revealed to the reader that Iron-Man (Tony Stark) planned the assassination in order to show the need for a Super-human Registration Act. When <a href=\"/captain-america/1442/\" data-ref-id=\"1442\">Captain America</a> is approached by <a href=\"/shield/3775/\" data-ref-id=\"3775\">SHIELD</a> to see if he could neutralize all of those against the Super-Human Registration Act, he refuses and has to run out after they try to shoot him down. Captain America is denounced as a criminal by the President, and he is ambushed by S.H.I.E.L.D, yet still escapes.</p><p>The <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warriors</a>, a group of mutants with their own TV show, trying to get higher ratings ambush <a href=\"/nitro/3160/\" data-ref-id=\"3160\">Nitro</a>, <a href=\"/coldheart/4005-26244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26244\">Coldheart</a>, <a href=\"/cobalt-man/4005-3286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3286\">Cobalt Man</a>, and <a href=\"/speedfreek/4005-25735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25735\">Speedfreek</a>. But Nitro, with powers amplified by <a href=\"/mutant-growth-hormone/4015-42280/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42280\">Mutant Growth Hormone</a>, sets off an explosion, killing around 600-1200 people, at least 60 confirmed to be children. Of the super-human individuals involved in the incident only <a href=\"/robbie-baldwin/4005-2104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2104\">Robbie Baldwin</a> and Nitro survived. <a href=\"/speedball/4005-2104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2104\">Speedball</a> was rocketed from the incident, hanging on to life, and Nitro jumped into the back of a passing pickup truck and fled the scene. This horrific event rushes the Super-human Registration Act, and within a week it gets passed. Although it is not necessary for a superhuman to give away his secret identity to the public, he or she is required to register with S.H.I.E.L.D., giving away all personal information. In return, SHIELD will provide some sort of safe-haven, pay heroes a salary, and they will be scheduled holiday breaks. This is seen as a slap in the face to a large portion of heroes, being forced to choose between become a federal employee, or stop fighting crime. Others, such as Iron Man, see this just as an evolution of Super-humans' roles in society. As a sort of reward for his support of the act, Stark gives Spider-Man an new \"Iron Spider\" suit that will enhance Spider-Man's abilities with technology similar to Stark's own Iron man outfit.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-80016\" data-ratio=\"1.5825\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-80016\"><img alt=\"I am Peter Parker.\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>I am Peter Parker.</figcaption></figure><p>In a move that would shock the world, Spider-Man would demonstrate his support for both Iron-Man and the bill by coming out publicly in support of the Bill as Peter Parker and Spider-Man.

Other superheroes begin to band together with Captain America against the act including <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>, <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Goliath</a>, <a href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\">Cloak</a>, <a href=\"/dagger/4005-1935/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1935\">Dagger</a>, the <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a> and many others. The growing friction escalates until the first major battle between Iron Man's registration act support and Cap's \" <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a>\". This battle involves all of the heroes associated with either side of the conflict, and comes to a climax with the unveiling of a cyborg version of <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> (presumed to be the actual Thor at the time) as being in support of the Registration Act. The appearance of Thor surprises both sides of the conflict, as few knew of his existence before this point. The clone is much more violent than the real Thor and kills Bill Foster with a lightning blast through the chest. Horrified at what has happened, <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> creates a force field around the battered remainder of the resistance allowing Cloak to teleport the team to safety. After the battle Thor is revealed to be a cyborg rather than the original that was made by Iron Man and Reed Richards and that his violent behavior was an unintentional glitch in their work. This event move begins shaking the resolve of some pro-registration heroes such as Spider-Man and the Invisible Woman and causing anti-registration heroes Nighthawk and Stature to switch sides.</p><p>After the death of Bill Foster, the Civil War now spills into the personal lives of Susan Storm and Reed Richards and threatens their marriage by disagreement over the course of action which Reed and Tony have carelessly embarked upon. Offended and hurt when Reed says that he is doing what he is to protect Sue, she erects a cylindrical forcefield that comes crashing through the center of all 35 floors of the <a href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\">Baxter Building</a> and asks Reed if she looks like she needs protection. Unable to come to an agreement, Susan and <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> leave the Baxter building under the cover of night to join Captain America's underground resistance to the act. The <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> also finds himself increasingly torn by the direction of the Civil War. He is watching those he loves and respects fight and take sides against each other. On one hand he is against the Superhuman Registration Act because he does not believe in what it stands for. On the other hand he believes himself to be a patriot, and as such does not believe that it is proper for him to be fighting his own government.</p><p>At this point the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a> have already began a recruitment drive, attacking and capturing other former villains for the government to train and employ as a means to capture more of the renegade super-heroes and super-villians. The Super-Human Restraint Unit, a sub-division of <a href=\"/shield/3775/\" data-ref-id=\"3775\">SHIELD</a> also starts to neutralize mutants who still display their powers (e.g., stop crime) without registering with SHIELD. Individuals such as <a href=\"/prodigy/40475/\" data-ref-id=\"40475\">Prodigy</a> even get taken down by Iron Man himself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192246\" data-ratio=\"1.5189873417722\" data-width=\"474\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 474px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192246\"><img alt=\"The Thing leaves\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg 474w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Thing leaves\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192246-ff538010_col.jpg 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Thing leaves</figcaption></figure><p>While transporting captured heroes to the containment facility Spider-Man finds himself uneasy when Iron Man asks him to remain at the head of the caravan of vehicles because of his ability to sense danger. Since he has never disclosed his Spider-Sense to Stark, Stark may have found out about his ability by using the suit to monitor him. A battle erupts when the Secret Avengers meet the caravan to release the captured members of the resistance. Using info from the Yancy Street Gang the anti-registration group tries to free captured heroes. Going after Captain America himself, Spider-Man finds himself in a fight he may not win. The two eventually stop fighting because Spider-Man cannot bring Captain America in himself even if he does win. Meanwhile, the Thing has been unintentionally drawn into the battle despite the Things insistence on remaining neutral. Both sides of the conflict mistake his intervention as acting on their behalf. After the battle the Thing angrily states that he cannot take any more of the fighting, and will be leaving for France. The government puts a hold on all of his finances and closely monitors him. Despite the unwanted attention, Ben Grim makes his way to France away from the conflict.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192208\" data-ratio=\"0.50471698113208\" data-width=\"848\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 848px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192208\"><img alt=\"Line 11-Peter v.s Tony Spider-man v.s Iron-man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 848w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Line 11-Peter v.s Tony Spider-man v.s Iron-man\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 848w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192208-svsi.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Line 11-Peter v.s Tony Spider-man v.s Iron-man</figcaption></figure><p>Possibly because he trusted Peter more (or possibly to watch him turn) Tony Stark takes Peter Parker on a tour of the Negative Zone prison so that Peter can finally see more of the inner workings of the act. Peter's faith in the act had been shaky ever since first agreeing to assist Tony, however it is finally broken as he sees the inhuman conditions in which former allies and enemies are to be kept in the negative zone for their civil disobedience. Occupants are locked up in their cells, and many will never leave because of the escape threat they pose. Some are fully restrained to the point they cannot move their bodies at all and others yet are put in virtual reality goggles to immerse them in a fake world to pacify them. Before leaving Tony leaves Peter alone with Reed briefly. Unbeknownst to Peter, Tony is monitoring their entire conversation (presumably using the bugs designed into Peters suit) where Peter questions a nearly broken Reed Richards about what they have found themselves in. When he gets back to Stark Tower Peter rushes Aunt May and Mary Jane to grab what they can and flee Tony Stark's grasp. Tony crashes in through the wall of the building and begins a fight with Peter that would flow into the streets of New York. Tony incapacitates Peter with a fail-safe he built into Peter's suit. Peter is able to gain the upper hand by reversing the fail-safe (Peter being quite adept with computer technology had already secretly discovered the secret code in his new suit and hacked Tony's programming). Peter flees into the sewer and Stark unleashes several of Spider-Man's enemies in the Thunderbolts into the sewers to capture Peter.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-107586\" data-ratio=\"1.5263157894737\" data-width=\"209\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 209px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-107586\"><img alt=\"Punisher saved my life.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" data-width=\"209\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg 209w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Punisher saved my life.\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" data-width=\"209\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Punisher saved my life.</figcaption></figure><p>Captured and beaten nearly to death, Peter is saved in the nick of time by the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> who shoots and kills his attackers. Carrying Peter over his shoulder, the Punisher breaks into Captain America's secret hideout to get Peter medical attention. The Punisher did not have much patience for costumed superheroes before the Civil War, and probably would not have become involved had it not been for Stark's alliance with the Thunderbolts allowing costumed villains to become government sponsored bounty hunters. Captain America disagrees with Castle's involvement because of his track record, yet tentatively allows him to remain with the group. His tenure with the Secret Avengers is cut short when a pair of costumed villains come to the Secret Avengers hideout with offer of truce to join the cause. Castle automatically shoots and kills them in cold blood causing Captain America to give the Punisher a severe beating. Castle would not fight back due to his respect for Captain America (who as it turns out also played a role in training Castle's army regiment), and simply takes the attack.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192256\" data-ratio=\"0.374\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:37.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192256\"><img alt=\"Hulkling Disguise\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg 500w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulkling Disguise\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg 500w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192256-hulkling_reveal.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulkling Disguise</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing that one of the members of the resistance is actually a double agent for Stark (specifically it is <a href=\"/tigra/4005-21188/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21188\">Tigra</a> that is double-crossing them), Captain America plans the most massive assault yet on the Registration Act. The plan is to infiltrate the Negative Zone prison and catch Stark off guard. What Tony does not know is that the morning of the attack Captain America sends <a href=\"/hulkling/4005-2259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2259\">Hulkling</a> disguised as Hank Pym to incapacitate Pym and take his place. As one of the key members of Stark's group, Pym has full access to everything about the Negative Zone Prison. Teddy, disguised as Pym, infiltrates the Prison and releases all of the anti-registration heroes and villains that had been captured until this point. Tony along with the registered heroes attempts to head off the Secret Avengers only to discover that the fixed fight that he had prepared in order to put an end to the resistance was now evenly matched. Attempting to stop the fight from leaving the prison, prison officials attempt to close down the portals to the Positive Zone, stranding everyone in the Negative Zone until things are resolved and the Secret Avengers are captured.

Once mobile, both groups begin fighting again, and inadvertently begin destroying everything around them. At the climax of the battle Iron Man has Captain America in his sights, and is ready to take him out of the battle. As instructed by Captain America, the <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a>'s <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a> phases into Iron Man's armor and partially solidifies to take his weapons out of the equation. Caught off guard and with his heavy armor effectively useless, Captain America is able to gain the upper hand against Iron Man. Pummeling him with his fists and his shield, Captain America raises his shield over the smashed helmet of Iron Man. Looking through the pieces of his broken armor up at Captain America he simply challenges \"Do it.\" Before Captain America is able to bring his shield down upon Tony's face he is tackled by nearby government workers: police, firemen, and other emergency personnel. At first struggling against them, Steve Rogers stops and drops down. The battle around him begins to stop almost immediately. Rogers is horrified by the realization that he was no longer fighting for the people that he was sworn to protect. Looking at the carnage around him and seeing for the first time the true cost to everyone involved (civilian and super power alike), Captain America surrenders and tells his team to stand down. For better or for worse, Steve Rogers has single handedly ended the Civil War. While some heroes including Captain America are taken into custody following the final battle of the War, many escape including some key members of the Secret Avengers.</p><h3>Involvement in the Civil

Registration is required of all Mutants and other Super-Powered individuals. Anyone without powers that wishes to don a costume to fight crime is also required to register. Individuals that accept and register will effectively become government S.H.I.E.L.D.. Agents and will be trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. and are required to work for the government on government salary. Amnesty for past actions is also offered as an incentive to registrants. Parallels can be drawn between the Super-human Registration act and the Mutant Registration Act.</p><p>See: <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\">Super-Human

When a tragic battle occurs, killing hundreds of people, the U.S. government demands that all super heroes unmask and register their powers. To Tony Stark - Iron Man - it's a regrettable but necessary step. To Captain America, it's an unbearable assault on civil liberties. So begins the Civil War. Based on the smash hit graphic novel - over half a million copies have sold in print and digital formats.</i><br /><ul><li>Written by: Stuart Moore</li><li>Published by: Marvel</li></ul></blockquote><h3>Television</h3><h4><a href=\"/avengers-assemble/4075-19/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-19\">Avengers Assemble</a></h4><p>The Season 2 storyline \"Avengers Disassembled\" very loosely adapted elements of the Civil War crossover, with a schism forming within the Avengers due to friction between Captain America.

Back at Xavier's Mansion, Rogue touches Bishop to look into his mind and the psychic backlash washes over her and Magneto, showing them glimpse of the real world and how everything should be. In the closing moments, Apocalypse notices Sinister is missing and Magneto calls a meeting for all of the X-Men and their associates while out in space the universe begins to crystallize.</p><h3>X-Men Chronicles</h3><p>The first issue shows Apocalypse's first attack on humanity and the first battle between Magneto's X-Men and Apocalypse's Horsemen ( <a href=\"/gideon/4005-2162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2162\">Gideon</a>, <a href=\"/candra/4005-7900/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7900\">Candra</a>, <a href=\"/war/4005-73720/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73720\">War</a>, <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a>, and <a href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\">Sabretooth</a>). In battle Sabretooth hesitated and he is left behind. Meanwhile back at Wundagore Mountain ,the X-Men's base of operations, <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> and Rogue defend the base and the younger mutant children against <a href=\"/nemesis/4005-9367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9367\">Nemesis</a> (Apocalypse's chosen son). The X-Men are successful in thwarting Apocalypse's attack on both fronts but at the cost of the life of the Scarlet Witch.</p><p>The second issue opens with Weapon X and Jean Grey leaving the team following him rescuing her from Sinister's genetic holding pens. Gambit and Rogue begin a romantic relationship but when <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-76835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76835\">Wolverine</a> attacks at Holocaust's (formerly Nemesis until his skin was all blown away) behest ,Rogue is forced to make a choice of saving Gambit or Magneto. She chooses Magneto and Gambit is buried under a falling wall. He survives and the battle is won but at the end he leaves the team.</p><h3>Astonishing X-Men</h3><p>Magneto tells all his X-Men what he saw in Bishop's head. Then <a href=\"/blink/4005-12548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12548\">Blink</a> arrives through a portal and is followed by a blazing out of control <a href=\"/sunfire/4005-3175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3175\">Sunfire</a> and it takes the combined powers of Magneto, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a> and <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a> to calm him down. They are followed by one of Apocalypse's Prelates, but Blink closes the portal on him killing him. Later, Rogue is preparing to leave and Gambit tries to talk to her down, and as he tries to kiss her they are interrupted by Blink carrying baby Charles. <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a> and Magneto discuss the various missions that have been assigned. <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> tries to stop Rogue from going to no avail while <a href=\"/morph/4005-12547/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12547\">Morph</a> make jokes and then everyone departs.</p><p>A team of X-Men (Rogue, Sunfire, Blink, Morph, Sabretooth, and <a href=\"/wild-child/4005-9476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9476\">Wild Child</a>) are sent to Chicago to stop Apocalypse's cullings. Sunfire freaks out as he remembers the killing that he lived through, and Rogue is forced to take his powers to calm him down. At the Mansion, Magneto is holding his sleeping son while Bishop berates him for his less-then-aggressive strategy. He tells Bishop he just wants tonight with his son. Meanwhile, Apocalypse has finally found Magneto's base and plans to handle the matter personally. Back in the battle, Sabretooth has Blink teleport him and Wild Child directly to Holocaust, against her own better judgement and Rogue's fervent wishes. After a brutal battle, Sabretooth finally cracks Holocaust's armor and watches the villain dissipate. However, after Sabretooth falls unconscious due to his own injuries, Holocaust rematerialized in his armor.</p><p>Wild Child flees the Infinities only to run into Holocaust. Holocaust picks up Wild Child and then reveals himself to actually be Morph just seconds before Sunfire fries them. Rogue and Blink arrive through a portal and Wild Child (since he cant speak) licks Rogue to give her his memories of what has occurred. Meanwhile the real Holocaust is holding a badly beaten Sabretooth over a cliff overlooking a new Infinities processing plant. He gloats about Apocalypse's new army before knocking Sabretooth unconscious again where Creed dreams of the night he and Logan (Weapon X) were on a mission and he saved a young Blink from being killed. As Sunfire flies the rest of the team to Creed's location, Morph continues to crack jokes and sing despite protest from Sunfire. Back at the Mansion, Bishop and Magneto have a tense conversation when Nanny comes in with Charles. The robot then senses major danger and wraps itself around the baby and disappears into the floor (Magneto explains that's her programming to protect Charles). At the Infinities plant, Holocaust is watching as thousands of Infinite soldiers are pumped out of the factory , when all of a sudden a large hump back whale becomes marooned on the plant floor. The whale reveals itself to be Morph and has the entire team hiding inside his mouth. They defeat the Infinities and go searching for Sabretooth. Blink cries out and teleports to him when she sees him tied up to a pole and bleeding.</p><p>Blink confronts Holocaust directly and after a brief but intense battle she teleports him over a vat of acid and drops him in. In another part of the facility Rogue and the rest of the team are fighting against hopeless odds, with an army of Infinities. Meanwhile Magneto is a captive of Apocalypse (see Amazing X-Men) and is being made to watch his wife's team fight their losing battle. Apocalypse continues to taunt the restrained Magneto until he knocks him out. Back at the plant, Wild Child and Sunfire free the humans being held captive while Morph goes after Blink. He finds her and as the two escape, Holocaust punches through the side of the acid vat and attacks them both. Suddenly \"Morph\" reveals himself as Rogue and uses her own powers to crack Holocaust armor again just as the real Morph jumps through the roof and becomes a large brick that crashes down on Holocaust. Rogue then lunges at him but he sends her flying leaving a ditch in the ground as she slides. While the rest of the team attacks Holocaust, Morph goes after Rogue, changing into her baby to get her attention. Holocaust then taunts about how Apocalypse found and destroyed the Mansion that the X-Men were in. This gives Rogue all the fury she needs as she pounds on him, landing both of them on a teleporter. Iceman grabs her just as he is about to teleport them both to Apocalypse's stronghold. With Creed saved and the team together again they vow to go after Apocalypse and end his reign.</p><h3>X-Calibre</h3><p>The young mutant <a href=\"/switchback/4005-41011/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41011\">Switchback</a> takes a gondola ride down a river cavern where she is left alone. Thinking shes been taken advantage of she is approached by a huge man who tells her that there are \"no charlatans here\". His name is Cain and he is there to lead her to <a href=\"/avalon/4020-55758/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55758\">Avalon</a>. They travel through freezing jungle (which she doesnt notice getting less and less frozen as she goes) then after several days they come upon the paradise of Avalon (616's Savage Land). Back in what was once Manhattan, Nightcrawler is lurking in Angel's private quarters at \"Heaven\" nightclub to get information on his travel plans to Avalon so he can locate the precog <a href=\"/destiny/4005-3557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3557\">Destiny</a> for Magneto. Angel balks at being used by him, Gambit and Magneto for illicit activities but gives him the information anyway, telling him to go to the east river and ask for <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Proudstar</a>.At the Xavier Mansion, Magneto orders <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique t</a>o assist her son, Nightcrawler, in reaching Avalon and assist him in extracting Destiny from there. At the warehouse by the east river, Nightcrawler meets Proudstar and his tribe \"the Ghost Dance\" which is the first step on the trek to Avalon, called \"the Infernal Gallop\". When Proudstar accuses Mystique of pillaging the people she ferries to Avalon before delivering them, Nightcrawler grabs his finger and teleports it off his hand. In the background, a young woman sneaks away to Apocalypse's citadel, frying the brain of a guard with a psychic arrow on the way there. The young woman, <a href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\">Danielle Moonstar</a>, approaches Apocalypse and one of his puppets, <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Dead Man Wade</a>, to tell him of Nightcrawler's trek to Avalon. Apocalypse call for <a href=\"/damask/4005-14848/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14848\">Damask</a> and tell her to take these two, collectively the Pale Riders, and find Avalon and burn it to the ground. Nightcrawler is on a cramped barge with other refugees, while down in Avalon Switchback has arrived an is brought by Cain to meet Destiny. As their fingers touch, Destiny has a painful precognitive flash of Avalon burning and Apocalypse coming.</p><p>As Destiny collapses from the shock of her vision Switchback, Cain, and Destiny's adopted son <a href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\">Doug Ramsey</a> rush to her side as she screams about Avalon burning. By the east river, Apocalypse's Infinities attack Proudstar's Ghost Dance and despite their best efforts are summarily dispatched. Menawhile on the submarine bound for Avalon, the air conditioning unit has busted and Nightcrawler and the other passengers are choking on their own exhalations. The captain surfaces rather then have everyone perish but warns that the instrumentation is broken and they may not be beyond American Detection Range. When they break the surface the crew realizes that the cargo bay doors are electronically sealed and everyone may have already suffocated to death. They signal a nearby ship who happen to have a torch to cut through the doors and save at least some of the people inside. The new ship's captain, <a href=\"/callisto/4005-3423/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3423\">Callisto</a>, offers her own ship to finish the submarine's trip to Avalon. Nightcrawler is on the roof of the sub, having teleported out (barely) when the ship broke air. Above on the Pale Riders' ship, <a href=\"/damask/4005-14848/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14848\">Damask</a> is watching these events unfold while Moonstar is repeatedly cutting Wade and watching his healing factor work. Damask receives a transmission from Apocalypse informing her that he is sending a secondary expedition and that when they arrive in Avalon she is to \"kill Avalon\". In frustration, she kills Moonstar and tells Wade \"And I loved it\". Back on the ship, Callisto has taken hold of the refugees to Avalon and they head on their way. She and her crew collect all valuables that the refugees have on them and then when they get to deeper water she orders the cargo doors in the water, dumping every passenger into the freezing cold ocean killing them. The bodies pile up the boat drifts in what is called an Atrocity Zone, small islands in the Atlantic where Apocalypse dumped all the corpses he was creating. Callisto shoots the crewman responsible for letting them drift in to it and tells the rest of the crew to wait for her signal. Unbeknown to Callisto, Nightcrawler has been teleporting around the ship taking out her crew one by one and he then appears on the deck and takes out the remainder of the crew. Callisto is about to shoot Nightcrawler when Mystique shows up and points a gun at her head.</p><p>Callisto is dead and Mystique and Nightcrawler, mother and son, are having a family reunion. They jump onto the ladder up to Mystique's helicopter and when Nightcrawler asks how she found him, she tells him that she was actually looking for the pirates because they'd killed the last two groups of travelers. On the Pale Riders ship, Wade is still devestated about Moonstar's death and Damask tell him that Moonstar never liked him anyway. Nightcrawler and Mystique arrive at Mystique's Antarctic headquarters and Kurt asks his mother why she won't go to Avalon. When she evades the topic he slaps her and accuses her of everything he had heard about her from the Ghost Dance. She admits that she takes the possessions of her passengers, calls it a tariff, and Nightcrawler tells her she isnt worthy of being in Avalon. Later, they are rowing down the underground river to Avalon and they meet Cain. Mystique asks where Destiny is and when he says she's too old to greet people anymore so he does it. The three of them trek to Avalon, with Cain carrying all the crates they brought and when they reach the edge of the paradise Mystique, who has never actually the end of the journey, is breathless over the beauty of Avalon and of the news the Destiny has a son. As they approach Destiny, Irene is thrilled to see Raven and hopeful that this means she will stay with them. When Mystique says she came to take her back with them, Destiny silently turns and leads them to Avalon Village. She introduced them to Switchback and tells of her vision that they will all die . Meanwhile at the entrance of Avalon, Wade is ready to kill everything as per his order while Damask on the other hand is so taken aback by the beauty she sees and is having seconds thoughts about her orders. In Avalon Village, Mystique and Nightcrawler are telling Destiny about Bishop, Xavier, and the alternate timeline. Destiny is hesitant to leave, claiming that her departure might cause Avalon to be destroyed and telling them that she has much to lose, such as her son. Suddenly a rocket blows up their tent and everyone scrambles to see what happened. Nightcrawler tries to get Cain to fight to protect them but he has a crisis of conscious so severe (his violent nature fighting his fanatical pacifist nature) that it caused an anuerism, killing him. Mystique and Co break out their guns, while on a hill Wade is continuing to shot at them. He asks Damask why she isnt killing anyone and she changes sides, stabbing Wade. This stalls his just long enough for Nightcrawler to teleport his head off his body. Damask tells him that if he wants her help shes willing and together with Mystique and Switchback they stand ready for Apocalypse's invasion.</p><p>While still standing over Wade's dead body, Switchback suddenly changes positions explaining that its her mutant power to shift herself back down her own timeline a max of 10 seconds, in this case to fix the headache she was getting. Mystique and Switchback head back to the village while Nightcrawler interrogates Damask about Apocalypse's next wave. She tells him she doesn't know as she learns in and rubs his face fur commenting it feels like velvet. Back in the village, everything is on fire and everyone is in pain. They find Destiny and Doug helping other people and Doug and Mystique get into a fight over Doug's mutant status (his translation field covers the area so everyone can communicatie) and how his mother could ever be friends with someone like Mystique. Switchback jumps in and says that all they want is for her to come to America and confirm or deny what Bishop is saying. Suddenly one of the villagers with bio-electric powers goes berzerk killing several others. Before Mystique can kill her, Doug stops her and says that he can read background noise in thoughts and that she has two. At this point, Shadow King reveals him as possessing the girl explaining that he came in with Wade and when he was killed jumped to Switchback (which explained her headache). Mystique shoves Doug out of the way and blasts the possessed girl. Damask tells them that all they did was kill his host and he'll have a new one by now. Nightcrawler asks how does his power work and she explains that he traveling from mind to mind through an adjacent dimension. Destiny stumbles through the carnage and Shadow King approaches her in the guise of a pyrotic mutant named Marcus and berates her life's work as a waste of time. Damask lashes out with her own power, searing psychic knives, which forces Shadow King out of the boy. The boy is released as Doug accuses Nightcrawler and Mystique of causing all the carnage to which he replies that it was inevitable andall they did was move it up the schedule. Suddenly, Mystique is possessed by Shadow King and begins cycling through forms until she stops on Sabretooth, because it was the worst memory he could find in her mind. Using a combination of their powers, Nightcrawler teleports while Switchback uses her power to extend their time between worlds (where they find Shadow King) and Damask destroys his mind with her psychic knives. With his last vestige of power he makes a nearby mutant blast Destiny but Doug jumps in the way and saves her, dying in the process. Destiny agrees to accompany Nightcrawler back to Magneto and help bring down Apocalypse.</p><h3>Gambit &amp; the X-Ternals</h3><p><a href=\"/jubilee/4005-4562/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4562\">Jubilee</a> is fleeing from Infinite soldier while carrying stolen medical supplies and as she falls Guido comes barreling through a wall and Sunspot blasts them. Jubilee is gathering up her bundles when Sunspot explodes another grunt above her. When Guido tries to check on her she just yells that shes fine and wasnt scared. The trio sneaks through the city to a human safehouses where they deliver the medical supplies under the watchful eye of the teams human member, Lila Cheney. She tells them that Gambit just got back but wont tell them where hes been. They walk through the underground tunnels (where legend tell of a tribe of mutants that once lived there) they that serve as their base until they come upon Magneto. They almost attack him but Gambit stops them and tell them that they came together and that Magneto needs their help stealing something BIG. At the headquarters of the Madri, a priesthood devoted to Apocalypse, Rictor berates his lackeys for not capturing the X-ternals and helping him get promoted. While the team walks through the tunnels, Guido and Jubilee discuss (sorta) Lila and Remy's dating again while Gambit and Erik have tense conversation about Rogue. Magneto leads them to a hidden chamber in the tunnel dubbed \"the Science Chamber\" and when they question Magneto's motives he tells them he got his information from Apocalypse's scientific librarian for cataloging and the information is guaranteed. He mentions that she didnt complain about his methods and reasons when he rescued her from an asylum but she says it was a long time ago. The doors open to a room full of scientific wonder jsut before the Madri teleport in. The X-ternals and Magneto dispatch the invaders while Sunspot locates Peter Corbeau the \"librarian\". Peter warns that if the Madri came the other will come and they dont have time. He pulls up information about the Shi'ar galaxy (which Magneto had asked him to find) on the rooms computers, which are composed of the remains of Apocalypse Celestial ship that Magneto downs years earlier. When Lila balks at the idea of going to outer space, Magneto informs her that she is a latent mutant and that her long range teleportation powers will be responsible for taking them. Using the chamber's cybernetic helmet, Corbeau helps Lila visualize the far off galaxy and open her mind to her own powers. As her power floods through her, Rictor and the Madri arrive and Magneto tells them to go while he fights them off. Lila opens a vortex that takes all the X-ternals through it and at the last possible second Rictor jumps through. Magneto defeats the rest of the soldiers and Peter(knowing Apocalypse will have him killed for this, sets the self destruct program.</p><p>The team arrives a moment later on the Shi 'ar homeworld and are immediately confronted by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard. Guido catches Lila as she falls from the sky, dropping Jubilee in the process. Rictor instantly surrenders but Gambit and the team turn and run which only incites the Imperial Guard to pursue them. After a brief battle they are able to escape into the cover of the forest. However, once they enter the forest, the forest trees begin to attack them and suck them down into the ground. Moments later the Guard with Rictor in tow come by and find no sign of them at all. Underground, the X-ternals see a speak to the shadowy figure who had the sentient plants abduct them and Lila says she felt the entire planet call her here through the portal. Rictor tells the Imperials that he has a tracker on one of the other mutants and as Oracle tries to read his mind there is a sort of feedback where she says that for a brief moment everything ceased to exist. She says that the telepathic spies were right and Emperor D'Ken's meddling of the M'Kraan crystal will destroy everything. Rictor offers to help provided he can have the X-ternals when they are finished. In the underground cavern, everyone also felt the nexus expansion effect. The leader, Jonah, recounts the story of how D'Ken came to power by murdering his father and Lilandra and wresting the throne from Deathbird. After becoming emperor, D'Ken discovered the M'Kraan crystal which was now radiating out energies that were threatening the entire universe. He tells them that the blink they felt means that this sector of space is next to be nullified. Even with Jonah's assurance that they will be spared so as to see \"the end of all that is\" so they can stop it from happening again, Jubilee still freaks out saying that they were just supposed to steal a rock, which Sunspot agrees with. Just as Jonah is rallying them to the cause, Rictor and the Imperial Guard burst in through the ceiling. As they groups battle another blink happens and everything starts to crystalize around them. At the last moment before they are turned to crystal, the X-ternals are teleported to a ship where they are face to face with the Deathbird and the Starjammers</p><p>The Starjammers ship drops out of hyper speed just outside the energy absorption system that surrounds the M'Kraan planet. When Gambit reconsiders the plan, Deathbird reminds him that he traveled across the universe for this. The Starjammers plan to keep the armada busy while the X-Ternals teleport planet-side. When they reach the surface they are instantly attacked by Shi'ar guards and Bobby tells them they don't have to beat the army; they simply have to delay them while Gambit and Lila get the jewel. Meanwhile, Gambit, Lila, and Deathbird approach the crystal (which Gambit didn't expect to be 3 stories high) and Deathbird tells them that as much power is in a sliver as in the whole crystal. As more soldiers approach them, Lila is grabbed by a strange hand and pulled inside the crystal. Gambit and Deathbird follow her and meet Jahf, the guardian of the M'Kraan. Outside, Guido, Sunspot and Jubilee continue fighting and after the next blink Sunspots hands turn white with energy. Suddenly Gladiator flies in with Rictor in tow, with soldiers still surrounding them the situation seems more and more hopeless. Inside the crystal Gambit, Deathbird and Jahf approach the center of the crystal where Lila and D'Ken stand transfixed by the glowing energy ball. When Deathbird attempts to attack Jahf she is mesmerized also. Jahf explains to Gambit how the crystal is the nexus of all realities (even mentioning the X-men who came through there back in the 70's). He tells Remy that Bishop is telling the truth about the world being wrong and how it was affecting every reality. Jahf tells him to take a shard of the crystal and use it to send Bishop tot the past and fix everything. Outside while Gladiator and Sunspot fight, there's another blink but this time Sunspot's entire body glows bright white and everyone except Rictor and the X-ternals are turned to crystal. Everyone leaps into the crystal as Gambit prepares to smash the energy matrix. As he hits the glowing ball, everything explodes and Sunspot absorbs more energy then ever before. He is left behind as Lila teleports them home.</p><p>Dazzler and Exodus search the Morlock tunnels beneath the mansion and find the ruined remains of Nanny but no sign of baby Charles. At Apocalypse's citadel, Rictor is being questioned by Apocalypse regarding the events with the X-Ternals. He recounts chasing Remy and Lila through the tunnel (with Guido and Jubilee heading in a different direction with the crystal shard towards Magneto). Though exhausted, Lila runs towards daylight while Rictor follows behind then taunting. Back at Rictor's interrogation, Apocalypse informs him that he was wrong to think that Gambit was more important than the crystal shard Jubilee carried, while he stroked the head of Magneto's son. Meanwhile in the tunnel, Jubilee is running with the crystal and baby Charles from Guido, who it turns out was a spy on their team. He tells her that two months earlier he was captured and has hated Gambit ever since. Guido agreed to spy on them and keep the rest of them safe. Apocalypse wants Gambit and Rogue to get to Magneto, but the plan went awry when they run into the robot which lead them to the mansion instead of Apocalypse as planned. Gambit destroys the robot.</p><h2>Lasting Effects</h2><p>Though this reality was supposed to have vanished when all was said and done, further issues have come out to show that this alternate reality still thrives. In addition, Bishop lived through both realities. But, since the AoA was never to have happened, his body reverted to what it was before the event but his mind kept the memories.</p><p>A few characters from the Age of Apocalypse made their way to Earth-616 before the reality was to disappear:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/x-man/4005-15051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15051\">X-Man</a> - The reality's version of <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a> created by Mr. Sinister using the genetic material from Cyclops and Jean Grey.

However, Apocalypse wasn't shown to control this reality. In this alternate reality, Magneto gathered all mutants to fight against humanity after Xavier was dead. In the two-part episode, \"One Man's Worth,\" a temporal anomaly caused Xavier to disappear and altered the reality. Bishop and his sister, Shard, learns that Fitzroy, the time-traveling mutant, had killed young Xavier in the past. Since Xavier was killed, his dreams of human and mutant coexistence had no meaning and thus the two races are having a war against each other. To prevent his death, Bishop and Shard convinces Wolverine and Storm's alternate selves to go with them and stop Fitzroy from killing young Xavier.</p><h3>Wolverine and the X-Men</h3><p>After the X-Men accomplish their mission in the present to avoid a world ruled by Sentinels, a variant of the Age of Apocalypse reality is shown in the final episode. Mr. Sinister and Cyclops are depicted in their Age of Apocalypse versions, alongside Apocalypse.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><p><b>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1964546-apocalypse_legends.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1964546\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74615384615385\" data-width=\"260\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 260px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1964546-apocalypse_legends.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1964546\"><img alt=\"AoA\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1964546-apocalypse_legends.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1964546-apocalypse_legends.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" data-width=\"260\"></a><figcaption>AoA</figcaption></figure><p>This game is heavily influenced by the \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline.

The Dark Knight has been Gotham City's protector for years, challenged by its many villains. But now there's a new villain on the scene, determined to conquer where others have failed. Known as Bane, he starts his campaign against Batman and Gotham by emptying Arkham Asylum, where so many of Batman's enemies are imprisoned and have spent their time plotting revenge. Almot single-handedly, Batman fights off these long-time opponents only to find himself so exhausted after it all that his strength fails him when Bane follows the onslaught to face Batman himself. Now Bruce Wayne is confined to a wheel-chair and must turn over his cloak and cowl to his apprentice, Azrael. But Azrael's philosophy of crime-fighting is much more violent and harsher than Batman's ever was. And now Bruce faces two challenges: the first is dealing with his incapacitation; and the second is dealing with Azrael who, it's become clear, is a loose cannon with an agenda all his own.</i></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>Written By: Dennis O'Neil</li><li>Publisher: Bantam Books (July, 1994)</li><li>ISBN-10: 0553096737</li><li>ISBN-13: 978-0553096736</li></ul></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>",

Under the guidance of the Monitor, his benevolent opposite, the super-heroes and villains of all realities are brought together for a last, desperate stand against the forces that promise the literal end of all existence.</i></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>Written By: Marv Wolfman</li><li>Publisher: Ibooks (April, 2007)</li><li>ISBN-10: 1596873434</li><li>ISBN-13: 978-1596873438</li></ul></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>",

    "deck": "In the chaos ensuing after the unleashing of the OMACs on Earth, the Spectre's vendetta against magic, and the Rann-Thanagar War, four beings decide to try and save the universe: Superman and Lois Lane of Earth-Two, Superboy of Earth-Prime, and Alexander Luthor of Earth-Three. What resulted was the *Infinite Crisis.*",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The story begins in the wake of the four lead-in limited series, with Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman feuding, the JLA Watchtower destroyed, and the heroes of the world all facing a variety of menaces. Over this backdrop, Kal-L (the Earth-Two Superman), along with Earth-Two Lois Lane, Earth-Three Alexander Luthor, and Superboy-Prime escape from the pocket universe where they had been left at the end of <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>. Kal-L seeks out his cousin, Power Girl, also a survivor of Earth-Two. Believing Lois' health will improve on her native world, he hopes to replace the current Earth-One with Earth-Two, which he considers perfect.</p><p>Kal-L tries to enlist Batman's support, stating that the Post-Crisis Earth's inherent \"bad\" nature caused Batman's recent mistrust and hostility. Batman refuses. Afterward, he learns Superboy-Prime destroyed the JLA Watchtower.</p><p>Alexander reveals to Power Girl that he and Superboy-Prime had been leaving their \"paradise\" for some time, manipulating events to help create an inter-dimensional tuning fork. Using the Anti-Monitor's remains and captured heroes and villains specifically attuned to former universes (Power Girl among them), Alex restores Earth-Two, un-populated except for the Earth-Two heroes transported there.</p><p>Superboy-Prime attacks Conner Kent, this world's Superboy. Multiple super-teams intervene. Superboy-Prime accidentally kills several heroes before the Flashes and Kid Flash force him into the Speed Force, assisted by speedsters already within it. Jay Garrick, the only speedster left behind, says the Speed Force is now gone.</p><p>Seeking to create a perfect world, Alexander restores many alternate Earths. The Earth-Two Lois dies, and an aggrieved Kal-L and the younger Superman Kal-El fight until Wonder Woman separates them. Bart Allen (wearing Barry Allen's costume and aged to adulthood) emerges from the Speed Force, warning that he and the other speedsters were unable to hold Superboy-Prime, who returns wearing Anti-Monitor inspired armor that stores yellow sun radiation to empower him, making him even stronger.</p><p>Batman's strike force destroys Brother Eye, a satellite AI created by Batman that had gone rogue and begun transforming civilians into nano-infused robots. Alexander selects and merges alternate Earths, trying to create a \"perfect\" world, until Firestorm blocks his efforts. Conner, Nightwing, and Wonder Girl release the Tower's prisoners. Fighting each other, Conner and Superboy-Prime collide with the tower, destroying it. The multiple Earths recombine into a \"New Earth\" as Conner dies in Wonder Girl's arms. Power Girl soon arrives and asks Kal-L what happened to Lois. The answer causes her to break down prompting her to ask Kal-L why. His answer is because he chose the wrong Superboy.</p><p>When a horde of supervillains attack Metropolis, heroes, current and retired, fly off to the rescue. They are joined by the National Guard. The battle results in multiple deaths on both sides, including many by Superboy-Prime himself, who kills villains and heroes alike. During the battle, Superboy-Prime takes off to destroy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oa\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oa</a>, planning to collapse the Universe, and recreate it with himself as the only superhero. Superboy-Prime breaks through a 300-mile thick wall of willpower, and then kills thirty-two Green Lanterns before Kal-L and Kal-El carry him toward Krypton's remains, now essentially a huge cloud of kryptonite. Flying through Krypton's red sun Rao destroys Superboy-Prime's armor and causes all three Kryptonians' powers to dissipate. Landing on the sentient planet (and Green Lantern Corps member) Mogo, they fight. Kal-El finally knocks Superboy-Prime out and the older Superman Kal-L dies of his injuries in the arms of his cousin, Power Girl.</p><p>Back on Earth, Batman, struggling with Superboy's death and Nightwing's severe injuries sustained during the Metropolis battle, contemplates shooting Alex. Batman is discouraged by Wonder Woman. Alex manages to escape.</p><p>Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman later meet up in Gotham. Wonder Woman plans to find out who she is. Batman plans a similar journey of self-discovery, revisiting the training of his youth, this time with Dick Grayson, now healthier, and Tim Drake joining him. Superman retires from superheroics until his powers return.

This leads to much confusion when determining an official reading order, but breaking each arc into smaller parts can alleviate this a bit. The following sequence is a high-level chronology.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/prelude-to-infinite-crisis/4050-25989/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-25989\"><i>Prelude to Infinite Crisis</i></a> (one-shot) collected several stories from earlier titles that led into the main story.</li><li><a href=\"/countdown-to-infinite-crisis/4050-18410/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18410\"><i>Countdown to Infinite Crisis</i></a> (one-shot) told the story of how Blue Beetle investigates the relationships between all the seemingly unrelated activities that are plaguing the world.</li><li>Prelude Mini-Series included <i>The OMAC Project</i>, <a href=\"/day-of-vengeance/4050-22747/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22747\"><i>Day of Vengeance</i></a>, <a href=\"/villains-united/4050-18403/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18403\"><i>Villains United</i></a> and <a href=\"/rann-thanagar-war/4050-20002/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20002\"><i>Rann-Thanagar War</i></a>. Each series was unrelated to the others in the sense that they can be read stand-alone, and only tie in to the main story after each is complete.</li><li><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4050-17983/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-17983\"><i>Infinite Crisis</i></a> is the main story.</li><li><a href=\"/infinite-crisis-secret-files/4050-21773/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21773\"><i>Infinite Crisis Secret Files</i></a> (one-shot) tells the background story of the main players in the Infinite Crisis mini. This was published between issues 5 and 6 of the main series.</li><li>Four Infinite Crisis specials/one-shots were published, with the same titles as each of the Prelude Minis, in between Infinite Crisis issues 3 thru 7. These tie the prelude stories back into the events of the main series.</li><li>The Aftermath Mini-Series included <a href=\"/infinite-crisis-aftermath-the-battle-for-bludhaven/4050-22256/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22256\"><i>Battle for Bludhaven</i></a> and <a href=\"/infinite-crisis-aftermath-the-spectre/4050-27522/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27522\"><i>The Spectre</i></a>.

    "description": "<p>Famously mismanaged DC crossover from the early 1990s.</p><p><a href=\"/waverider/4005-10029/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10029\">Waverider</a> is sent back in time from a <a href=\"/dystopia/4015-55822/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55822\">dystopian</a> future to prevent a tyrant from gaining power. Armed only with the knowledge that <a href=\"/monarch/4005-12940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12940\">Monarch</a> used to be a superhero, Waverider touches each superhero with his or her own Annual for a glimpse of the future.</p><p>The problems arose when word leaked early in the summer that Monarch was going to be <a href=\"/captain-atom/4005-2050/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2050\">Captain Atom</a>. In a ridiculous attempt at damage control, the editors at DC decided to re-write their ending on the fly. At the last minute, Captain Atom was allowed to continue as a hero while Monarch appeared and brutally murdered <a href=\"/dove/4005-3573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3573\">Dove</a> from also-ran Titan wannabes Hawk &amp; Dove. When Dove is killed, <a href=\"/hawk/4005-3574/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3574\">Hawk</a> goes crazy, murdering Monarch who is revealed to be a future version of Hawk and putting on the Monarch armour himself.</p><p>It was a ignominious end for Hawk and Dove and was received badly by fans who sensed the rush job.</p><p>Interestingly, Captain Atom has recently been seen donning something similar to the Monarch armour so it's possible that there will be a return to the originally planned ending to this best forgotten series.</p><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/jla-in-crisis-secret-files-/4000-189342/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-189342\">JLA in Crisis Secret Files</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "DC crossover from Late 1991. George Pérez originally conceived the War of the Gods crossover as a tribute for Wonder Woman's 50th anniversary.",
    "description": "<h3>War of the Gods</h3><p>War of the Gods was orchestrated by the sorceress <a href=\"/circe/4005-10924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10924\">Circe</a>, to destroy reality and re-create it in her own twisted vision. In the name of <a href=\"/hecate/4005-5501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5501\">Hecate</a> the goddess of witchcraft and the source of Circe's power. She teamed up with a host of <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Womans</a> enemies to unleash her 'Holy War' just as Queen<a href=\"/hippolyta/4005-4929/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4929\"> Hippolyte</a> led a delegation of <a href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/4060-42494/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42494\">Amazons</a> from their home,<a href=\"/themyscira/4020-56187/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56187\"> Themyscira</a> to mans world. It would be the first time in 3000 years that any of the Amazons had set foot in the world of man.</p><p>Circe along with<a href=\"/cheetah-minerva/4005-8344/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8344\"> Barbara Minerva</a> and Konrad Kaslak a museum curator of unscrupulous morals, collected ancient relics dedicated to the war gods of various pantheons. <a href=\"/mikos/4005-78835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78835\">Mikos</a>, Circe' right hand man had learnt of the Amazons visit to the<a href=\"/north-america/4020-58136/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58136\"> United States</a> and with the <a href=\"/amazons-of-bana-mighdall/4060-58296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58296\">Amazons of Bana-Mighdall</a> framed the Themyscirans for the apparent theft of the valuable artifacts.<a href=\"/dr-psycho/4005-4918/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4918\"> Dr. Psycho</a> another of Wonder Womans enemies distracted the Amazon Warrior by invading the minds of her closest friends the Kapatelis', and turning them against her. He then turned on the weakened Hermes, who was then bested by his Roman counterpart Mercury. Finally Circe lured the children of Ares, Phobos and Eris to her side - promising them greater power when her War of the Gods ended with her as victor.</p><p>As planned the Egyptian Amazons stole the relevant relics from various cities at the same time as the Themyscirian Amazons began their Tour. But the Banas left countless dead and the police began investigating Wonder Woman and her Amazons, suspecting a connection. In Gotham City, the Cheetah sought out Hippolyte and hired Maxie Zeus to steal the Goblet of Heracles from the Amazon Queen. At the same time, Bana Amazons arrived at the Queens hotel to kidnap her and her Amazons and take them back to Circe. But the Goblet and the Queen vanished. Enraged, the Cheetah took out her frustrations on the remaining Amazons - killing Hellene before fleeing back to Boston. The police arrived and opened fire on the Amazons badly wounding General Phillipus, as Police Commissioner gordon called for a city wide hunt for the fugitive Amazons.</p><p>Meanwhile in South America, Circe assembled the stolen relics at her altar while coercing the roman Gods to battle their greek counterparts. Having last their Mount Olympus when the Greek Gods destroyed there own. Dr Psycho continued to manipulate the minds of Wonder Woman and Hermes, making them battle each other above Boston. After freeing herself from the villains mental powers, Diana handed herself into the police. Across the nation the Banas bombed embassies and public places and framing the Themyscirans as they did it. The UN declared a state of war between itself and the Amazons. Wonder Woman came to the realisation that her enemies were collectively trying to destroy her and her whole nation. At this realisation, Wonder Woman fled the police and having found a couple of Amazon sisters, fled with them back to their island. On Themyscira the Amazons voted to invade America before America brought the war to them and demanded that Diana lead the fight in the absence of her mother, the Queen.</p><p>Just the the newly returned Olympian Gods ushered Diana to New Olympus, where they explained that something had corrupted Olympus spirit and had made it a cosmic prison. Donna Troy had also materialised on Olympus trapped in an energy field that no-one could break through. It was then that the Roman Gods showed themselves and claiming Olympus as theirs. They had with them their champion - Captain Marvel. The gods quickly went to war with each other as did Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel before being teleported off the Mount. Wonder Woman reappeared on earth while Captain Marvel was sent across the galaxy.</p><p>Circe used the God War to make her Hellfire Spell. A spell that would go round the earth and start to destroy it and the fabric of reality itself. The spell also called on the War Gods of various pantheons, each wanting to destroy the reality and remake it in their own image. Egyptian Gods attacked Dr. Fate in New York. The Babylonian god <a href=\"/kingu/4005-19848/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19848\">Kingu </a> and the monster Tiamat fought against Aquaman and Power Girl in Atlantis. While Firestorm and Firehawk fought in Africa. Celae, a Thanagarian goddess took possession of Hawkwoman in Chicago and the Justice League battled the Norse Gods in Norway. And Phobos unleashed Quetzalcoatl against Superman, in a hope that the Man of Steel's attention would be taken off Circe and the conflict on New Olympus.</p><p>With Eris, the goddess of Discord's help - Mars the Roman god of War attacked Ares in his own home, Areopagus. And in Central City, Hermes battled his Roman counterpart Mercury until Mercury disappeared. At the same time other mythological figures disappeared - Hercules, Atlas, Zeus and Achilles.</p><p>Fearing the earth would be destroyed by the conflict, earths sorcerers brought Wonder Woman to them, hoping to use her spiritual bond with the earth goddess Gaea, and the terramorph powers of Geo-Force to wrap the earth in a protective spell. Circe had hoped for this, and was going to use her own magics to steal the collected sorcerers powers, and add it into the Hellfire Web. But the witch's former alley Konrad Kaslak, betrayed her, taking one of the relics from the alter, therefore preventing the witch from accessing the powers of the magicians. Gaea was saved and many of the war gods threw off Circe's cloud of deception and departed.</p><p>Wonder Woman then located her missing mother with help from Batman and tracked her back to Egypt and the ruins of Bana-Mighdall. There she found her mother dressed in the armor of Shim'Tar, the Bana Queen. They clashed but Hippolyte was no match for her daughter in strength and was easily defeated and taken home.</p><p>Meanwhile Black Adam and the Suicide Squad invaded Circe's tower as a distraction for the witch as earths sorcerers used Animal Mans powers to nullify the Bestiamorph spell. Transforming the were-creatures into harmless animals. The Squad destroying Circe's tower in the process. Circe, outraged by the disruption to her Holy War, took her anger out on the greatly weakened Hermes, in a fight in Limbo, where he had banished her before, Hermes lost and was killed by the witch. From there, Circe teleported to Themyscira and faced Diana directly. Goading Wonder Woman into anger by showing her Hermes still smoking skeleton. Diana didnt get very far though, as Circe unleashed a spell that began to transform Diana into the clay that she was born from, the clay they were standing on. Wonder Woman was no more! At the same time US fighter planes broke through the islands shields set to bomb it. Even as New Olympus appeared in Earths atmosphere.</p><p>The Amazons, Earths heroes and Heracles stormed New Olympus to save all of creation. In the midst of battle, Circe destroyed Son of Vulcan and drained her one time ally, Eris. While Phobos retreated to parts unknown. Ares, God of War realised that the conflict was fueling Circe's magic and would only end with their destruction at each others hands. he and various other War Gods, asked for there to be an end to the war. While Superman intercepted the fighter planes and saved the Amazons home from being destroyed.</p><p>Harbinger led a newly awakened Hippolyte to the beach to resurrect her daughter while the wizard Shazam wanted to repower Captain Marvel. Using the original spirits of the Shazam spell - safely out of Circe's reach in the bodies of the Metal Men. The spell was recast to give Billy Batson his powers back. While Wonder Woman was reborn in the newly sculpted clay body. Captain Marvel took the fight to Olympus, powered now by the powers of the Gods. The sorcerers of earth teleported Donna Troy and Circe herself into Limbo, where Wonder Woman was waiting for them. Circe, enraged that Diana was alive again, attacked by firing her mystic might at Diana. Her bolts were deflected by the talisman of Harmonia and absorbed into Donna Troys tunic, which was a portal to the original gods, The Titans of Myth. At this, Circe's body began to decay as the Goddess Hecate's soul deserted her and tried to possess Wonder Woman. But catching Hecate's soul in her lasso of truth, Diana bound the goddess as the Titans consumed her soul as Circe's body crmbled to dust.</p><p>With the War of the Gods over, the Greek Olympians gave their Roman counterparts New Olympus while they decided to explore the universe. As they left they lifted the protection that surrounded Themyscira and for the first time in its history the island was visible to the world. The UN cleared the Amazons of Themyscira of any crimes, even as the Amazons mourned their dead.The city of Bana-Mighdall was covered over by the desert and Circe's own island of Aeaea disappeared into the sea.</p><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/jla-in-crisis-secret-files-and-origins/4050-30656/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30656\">JLA in Crisis Secret Files and Origins</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-dc-comics-encyclopedia-the-dc-comics-encyclopedia/4000-120848/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-120848\">The DC Comics Encyclopedia Vol. 1</a></li></ul>",

As the timestream breaks apart, alternate versions of heroes appear: a <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson</a> from when he was <a href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\">Robin</a>; <a href=\"/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Barbara Gordon</a> from when she was <a href=\"/batgirl/4005-1701/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1701\">Batgirl</a>; a pre-Crisis <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a>; and an alternate history hero named <a href=\"/alpha-centurion/4005-13054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13054\">Alpha Centurion</a>. The heroes deal with their alternate counterparts, while trying to stem the tide of chaos the time rifts are creating. While the heroes think Extant is behind the crisis, the true enemy is soon revealed: <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a>.

The heroes regroup, and launch an attack on Parallax in the void of nothingness. The heroes defeat Parallax, and manage to restart the universe, recreating the Big Bang by using <a href=\"/damage/4005-3582/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3582\">Damage</a> as a catalyst. However, this new restarted universe varies slightly from the old one, with some discontinuities eliminated and retcons introduced in the <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a> cleaned up.</p><h2>Creation</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Zero Hour: Crisis in Time was a crossover event that thematically followed <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics</a>’ 1985 crossover event <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4050-3441/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3441\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>. During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the DC multiverse was condensed down to a single universe, which necessitated a revamping of the origins of many of its superheroes. Creative teams were engaged to revamp, or “retcon” superheroes to make their origins much simpler and to appeal to a newer audience.</p><p>After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, there were major revamps to the histories of characters like <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href=\"/hawkman/4005-8337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8337\">Hawkman</a>. However, each of these relaunches happened in varying times after the Crisis; Superman’s revamp in 1986, Wonder Woman’s in 1987, and Hawkman’s in 1989, for example. Because of these revamps, and their delays in taking effect, DC Comics’ continuity became muddled; for instance, Superman was said to never have been <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a>, which affected the history of the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. The retcons caused havoc in the characters’ timelines.</p><p>DC sought to rectify this by creating a new event called Zero Hour, which would relaunch all of the heroes from the same point in time. They would use this event to make some changes (minor for the most part) to characters’ backstories, to allow for previous inconsistencies. From a marketing point-of-view, they also used this event to cancel lower-selling books, while launching new books with new origins for characters. Titles that were canceled include <a href=\"/justice-league-international/4050-4966/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4966\">Justice League International</a>, <a href=\"/legion/4050-18909/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18909\">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a>, <a href=\"/team-titans/4050-9320/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9320\">Team Titans</a> and <a href=\"/valor/4050-4759/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4759\">Valor</a>.</p><h3>Zero Hour</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1625105-32_zero_hour___crisis_in_time__1___page_23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1625105\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5325\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1625105-32_zero_hour___crisis_in_time__1___page_23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1625105\"><img alt=\"Sample Zero Hour \"wipeout\" from issue #1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-width=\"800\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1625105-32_zero_hour___crisis_in_time__1___page_23.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1625105-32_zero_hour___crisis_in_time__1___page_23.jpg 800w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83392/1625105-32_zero_hour___crisis_in_time__1___page_23.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sample Zero Hour \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sample Zero Hour \"wipeout\" from issue #1</figcaption></figure><p>The Zero Hour event took place in a five-issue miniseries (numbered in descending order from 4 to 0), and with 27 crossover books. <a href=\"/showcase-94/4050-21865/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21865\">Showcase ’94</a> #8-9 served as a backstory to the event, highlighting Extant’s creation.

Zero Hour: Crisis in Time #0 also featured a pullout three-page timeline of the “new” DC universe.</p><p>Each of the Zero Hour crossover books follow the same format: some event tied to the Zero Hour cross-over would happen, with the “time rift” causing the world to be wiped out. This “wipe out” was represented by pages fading to blank, and blank pages filling out the book until the back cover, with the Zero Hour logo usually appearing ion the last page. To accommodate this design, DC placed the traditional letter column earlier in the issue.</p><h3>Zero Month</h3><p>With the release of Zero Hour #0, the universe was said to begin anew. Each comic was released as a number zero, and the event was referred to as Zero Month. These comics either served as a retelling of the retconned origin of the major character or team ( <a href=\"/superman/4050-3816/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3816\">Superman</a>, <a href=\"/batman/4050-796/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-796\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4050-3824/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3824\">Wonder Woman</a>), as a change of direction for the character or team ( <a href=\"/green-arrow/4050-4003/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4003\">Green Arrow</a>, <a href=\"/justice-league-task-force/4050-4967/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4967\">Justice League Task Force</a>, <a href=\"/the-new-titans/4050-4014/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4014\">New Titans</a>), or as a way to launch a new series altogether.

    "description": "<p>Brief Lives was a significant step in the series at the time, for one thing it was the first time readers saw the remaining sibling in The Endless family, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40831\" href=\"/destruction/4005-40831/\" slug=\"destruction\">Destruction</a>. All the other six had made their first appearance at least two years prior. This arc was pivotal in defining Dream's family and took away a lot of the earlier mysteries about them. Some of his siblings had jumped in and out of his life throughout previous arcs and they had gathered for a brief meeting at the beginning of <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40834\" href=\"/season-of-mists/4045-40834/\" slug=\"season-of-mists\">Season of Mists</a>, but this saw more development for most of them then they had up until that point and better showed the interpersonal relationships between them.</p><p>More specifically, Brief Lives was the arc that established an identity for the youngest member of the family, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40852\" href=\"/delirium-of-the-endless/4005-40852/\" slug=\"delirium-of-the-endless\">Delirium</a>, who would become the second most significant of Dream's brothers and sisters after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7280\" href=\"/death-of-the-endless/4005-7280/\" slug=\"death-of-the-endless\">Death</a>.</p><p>In this arc, Dream was forced to become more involved with his family he had previously tried to shun and he found himself putting aside his own personal drama as an act of kindness towards his sister which ended in him doing things he had never intended, developing his character into that of a much more selfless being. The consequences of these actions would have a huge impact on his personal journey and the series as a whole.</p><p>Thus, Brief Lives became the turning point in the series, beginning the journey to the already inevitable end of Dream's death.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>A mutated Killer Croc holds the young heir of a wealthy family for a ten million dollar ransom which he plans to use to fix his mutation. Batman arrives on the scene, defeats Croc and saves the child. During the fight, Catwoman snuck in and stole the ransom money. As Batman chases after her high above the rooftops of Gotham, his bat-rope is mysteriously cut and he fall right in the middle of Crime Alley, fracturing his skull. He is saved by Huntress and Oracle who brings him back to the Bat-Cave using the Batmobile. With Alfred unable to help him, a barely conscious Batman signals to his butler with Morse code the name \"Thomas Elliot\", a famous surgeon and a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne. Dr. Elliot manages to save Bruce's life.</p><p>Killer Cros escapes from jail and goes after Catwoman who reveals that she was being mind-controlled by Poison Ivy when she stole the money, but Croc doesn't care and tries to kill her only to be stopped and defeated by Batman again. Catwoman thanks Batman with a passionate kiss causing Batman to start to develop feelings for her. She also reveals that Ivy is in Metropolis. There, the two track her down only to be confronted by her latest mind-controlled victim, Superman. Using a kryptonite ring, underground tunnels and his own wits, Batman manages to hold off Superman's long enough to break Ivy's control over him. After that, they manages to finally take down Poison Ivy.</p><p>Later on, Bruce Wayne is invited to the Opera House by his friend Tommy Elliot along with Selina Kyle and Leslie Thompkins. Harley Quinn then crashes the show and attempts a robbery. As Batman chases after here, he is horrified at the site of Joker standing over the dead body of Tommy. Enraged, Batman quickly takes down Harley and then proceeds to savagely beat Joker almost to death until he is stopped by Jim Gordon. Later on, after stopping a robbery by Riddler, Batman finds traces of the Lazarus Pit in the crime scene and so tracks down Ra's Al Ghul to Africa where, after defeating the villain, learns that someone has been using Ra's' Lazarus Pit.</p><p>Following Nightwing's advice, Batman finally gives in to his feelings for Catwoman and reveals his identity to her. Later on, Scarecrow is on the loose in a cemetery, and after Batman takes him down, a man with a bandaged face appears, holding Robin hostage and reveals himself to be Jason Todd, the Robin who dies many years ago. As Batman gives chases, he finally realizes that it's actually Clayface in disguise.</p><h2>Part 1: The Ransom</h2><p><a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> breaks into a building in a shipping yard. He knocks out several miscellaneous people (a Gotham city wrestler, an FBI agent, a military veteran). We see in the captions that Batman is out to rescue a kidnapped boy who is the son of a major Industrialist and a close friend of <a href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\">Lex Luthor</a>. Batman rescues the boy but <a href=\"/killer-croc/4005-3725/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3725\">Killer Croc</a> (the kidnapper) attacks him. Batman and Croc fight. Batman says that this is too smart for someone like Croc, that's why he had to get involved but he would have anyway. Batman and Killer Croc fight and Batman wins and chains up Croc. Several FBI field operatives swarm the place. They take the boy with them but the ransom money is missing since it was with Croc a while a ago. Batman activates the Heat sensors in his mask and sees <a href=\"/catwoman/4005-1698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1698\">Catwoman</a> swing away with the ransom money. Batman chases her and Batman acknowledges there is something strange about this even for Catwoman to just come and steal the ransom money. He chases her and just when he was about to catch her something cuts the bat line and Batman falls. He grabs a gargoyle but slips and crashes to the ground in crime alley. Catwoman meanwhile goes and delivers the ransom money to <a href=\"/poison-ivy/4005-1697/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1697\">Poison Ivy</a>.</p><p>A street gang surrounds Batman, one of them tries to take off his mask but it releases a pepper spray. Another one tries to hit Batman with a metal pipe but the batsuit electrifies him. <a href=\"/oracle/4005-5368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Oracle</a> meanwhile finds out Batman is down and calls for help. A gang member was about to shoot Batman in the head. <a href=\"/huntress/4005-1690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1690\">Huntress</a> then arrives on her bike and kicks the would-be shooter. She takes on the gang. Batman, unconscious is able to hear Huntress fight and compliments her in his head that she is just like he was in his first year. Oracle sends the Batmobile by remote control and Huntress puts him in it. Poison Ivy arrives in a dark street, a voice in the dark ask if it is his half. She says yes and hands it over to him. A while later, Bruce is able to hear Alfred. Bruce's injuries are too big even for him to operate on. Bruce's skull is fractures and has many other injuries. Bruce begins to tap morse code of the operating table, Alfred hears it as <a href=\"/hush/4005-9588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9588\">Dr. Tommy Elliot</a> a childhood friend of Bruce. Bruce is taken to a hospital and Dick wreaks the Wayne car to fake a car accident. Tommy Elliot arrives from Philpedia, now a world renown surgeon. He operates on Bruce with several other surgeons, Bruce has a brief flash back of both of them playing antique war games, Bruce loses because he can't think like the enemy. Bruce recovers from the head injury and will leave the hospital soon. Later a shadowy figure is reading an article on the accident written by <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a>. He crushes the paper and cuts through the Wayne's picture with a sharp object. He declares war so \"That we may live in peace\".</p><h2>Part Two: Beast</h2><p>Batman, now recovered, visits Killer Croc in <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum</a>. Killer Croc shouts to Batman saying the money was his. Batman ignores him and speaks to the guards. Killer Croc gets mad and shatters the shatterproof glass. He attacks the guards and Batman attacks him only to get a choke hold on his neck. Croc throws him at the guards and escapes through the drainage. Amanda Waller was watching this, she tells Batman he has until midnight to find and interrogate Croc after that the FBI will recapture him and he becomes a federal criminal since Croc had kidnapped the son of a close friend of President Lex Luthor. Batman goes after Croc, Batman was counting on his escape since he had jammed a tracking device on him, he was hoping that it will lead to the person who orchestrated the kidnapping. Meanwhile, Tommy Elliot visits the Wayne Manor. He talks to Alfred and leaves when he finds Bruce gone. Before he leaves he says that Bruce is playing a dangerous game, going out about. Batman has a flashback of a similar night, Tommy comes to visit him during a storm his parents just had a car crash and were near death. Bruce promises to Tommy that his father will save them. Thomas comes out and says Tommy's mother survived but his father had died. Tommy gets angry and punches Bruce, Thomas comforts Tommy and tells Bruce to be quiet despite the fact that Bruce was bleeding. Back in the real world Batman is still on the trail of Croc. Something blows out one of the tires of the Batmobile. The car loses control and crashes into a wall. Batman escapes with no injuries. Killer Croc arrives at a Greenhouse to find Catwoman. Croc believes she has his money and Ivy passed the word to her in Arkham. Catwoman denies of having the money and that Ivy was supposed to meet her there. Croc almost eats Catwoman but Batman ties Croc's jaws with a bat bola, connects it to the grapnel hook and shoots it outside taking Croc with it.</p><p>Batman begins to talk to Croc who says he needed the money to fix himself to, become human again, but before he could go further the FBI arrives and catches Croc. A figure perched on a roof top quotes \"All men by nature desires knowledge\". Batman turns around to see no one there. A few nights later, Batman meets with Catwoman. She says that she's found Poison Ivy and that she is in <a href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis</a>. Catwoman and Batman have a moment and she kisses for saving her life. After a moment they separate Batman gives her a tracking device. If she finds Ivy first she has to alert him with that. Catwoman then takes off into the night.</p><h2>Part Three: Metropolis</h2><p>Bruce Wayne goes to Metropolis he remembers a long time ago, when he was a kid, he wanted to come to Metropolis. He has brief flashbacks of him kissing Catwoman. He walks around the airport and several women seem to admire him. Tommy Elliot is there and he calls Bruce. They meet up and talk friend to friend. They talk about the first time they visited Metropolis. Thomas Wayne took them there once Tommy came along when Martha Wayne suggested Bruce could bring a friend. While Bruce and Tommy were waiting for Thomas to come out of the Metropolis hospital, they see Green Lantern ( <a href=\"/alan-scott/4005-12663/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12663\">Alan Scott</a>) fly over them. They both follow him and sees him fighting with <a href=\"/icicle/4005-12097/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12097\">Icicle</a>. Tommy gets excited about the battle and wants to follow them, but Bruce suggested they go back. Thomas finds out that both of them had wandered off and the two had to stay at a hotel room the entire time they were in Metropolis. Bruce and Tommy are talking about this in the Limo, Tommy mentions Bruce hadn't given himself enough time to heal, (\"You're not <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>, you know\"). Tommy also mentions that he had to take a bone chip out of Bruce's skull while operating in him. They arrive at the Daily Planet (\"It's always nice to see Lois\" Bruce thinking) and Tommy departs for a little walk.</p><p>Bruce enters the Daily Planet and brings a bunch of roses to Lois. Clark and Lois were working on a story and Lois pretends to flirt with Bruce. Bruce asks whether he could use Lois's computer. He establishes a link with Oracle, about a plant called Aztec Gilia according to Oracle it requires ethylene which Lex Corp has bio engineered to withstand temperature changes. Lois secretly read some of that and Perry arrives and talks with Bruce, they both go on away from the newsroom. As for Lois (\"So much for flirting with the billionaire playboy to find out what he is really doing here, hope I didn't make you too jealous, Mr Kent\"). Clark says that there is another way to find out what Bruce is really doing here, he then pulls on his collar. That night, Batman breaks into Lex Corp tower, now that Lex is the President of the U.S.A, Talia Head is in control of the company. They both talk and Talia (\"There is something different about you.\"). Batman asks her whether anyone in the city had obtained large doses of ethylene. She agrees to give him the information he needs and Batman gets a signal Catwoman had found Poison Ivy.</p><p>Batman and Catwoman meet on an elevated train. Catwoman explains to Batman that she wants to get her revenge on Poison Ivy. She had taken control over her Catwoman's mind and now that she is out of it she wants to make her pay for violating her like that. She then tells Batman that he has to wait his turn when they confront Poison Ivy. At the docks, Poison Ivy is tending her plants, Catwoman comes in still pretending to be under her control but (Poison Ivy: *yesss, ;but I can always tell when someone is pretending!) She slaps Catwoman but she fights back, and cuts a shallow cut on her neck when one of Poison Ivy's vines attacks her, a flying batarang cuts through the vine killing it. Poison Ivy smiles and says she's got her own champion, the building begins to shake (..no, not here), two hands begins to lift the entire building(\"not now..:\") and turns it over and it falls into the water. (Not HIM) Batman gets up from the rubble, Catwoman is unconscious and Superman stands in front of Batman with Poison Ivy in his arms. He warns Batman: If you come near her, you are going to have to go through me.</p><h2>Part 4:Batman vs Superman</h2><p>Catwoman wakes up from the rubble then Poison Ivy orders Superman (under her control) to kill them both. Superman uses his heat vision, Batman grabs Catwoman and ducks. The heat vision cuts through Batman's cape and Batman (still holding on to Catwoman) jumps into the water with her. He gives her a breathing mask and Batman presses a button in his belt and jet propellers propel them through the water. Poison Ivy looks down at her plants, all of them were dead. She tells Superman that he killed them and they were like children to her, (*I'm sorry) she smiles and tells Superman that there's one more thing she likes for him to do, she kisses him again to bring him to her control. Batman and Catwoman enter a tunnel accessed through the water and Oracle guides them through the maze. Batman explains that Superman will be back and plants several devices on the wall, and takes out a green kryptonite ring (You don't come to Metropolis, not expecting to meet him). Catwoman agrees to Batman's plan and kisses, she says next time he may not be able to do that. The walls suddenly begin to shake and Catwoman leaves. Superman bursts through the wall and Batman throws the first punch. They both fight and Batman activates a button in his belt and a hypersonic sound wave disrupts Superman's super hearing and gave him a massive headache. Superman fights back freezing Batman's hand . Batman activates the devices only the wall, a blinding light fills the tunnel. As Superman recovers (Clark! I've activated a gas leak, if you used your heat vision you will take out the entire block, and you know what building we are under!) Batman shoots his grapnel, Superman throws another punch but Batman swings away saying he lied about the gas main and Superman ends up hitting a power line. After Batman comes to the surface and melts away the ice on his hand, Superman comes out of the hole, angry, and picks up a truck to crush Batman (Look up, you can either save her or fight me) Superman looks up and sees Catwoman forcefully, taking Lois on a flag pole and she hits Catwoman on the stomach and falls. (C'mon Clark be the boyscout...please*). Superman super speeds into the air and catches Lois, breaking Poison Ivy's spell. (No offense Clark, but you look like hell. Lois). Superman lands on the roof top and so does Batman. He explains about the Poison Ivy's mind control and that her lipstick was laced with kryptonite for her spell to work, Clark knew what he was doing but couldn't control it. They talk about how to catch Poison Ivy and Batman picks up a leaf on Superman and points it to his face and Superman knew what he meant. A while later Poison Ivy is in a rich hotel room with her cash when Batman (it's over Poison Ivy) and she turns to the other side to see Superman now out of her spell, she runs to the door and opens it, only to face <a href=\"/krypto/4005-8332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8332\">Krypto</a>: the Superdog (All the detective work in the world can't beat a Superdog with super smell). Poison Ivy turns around to see Catwoman (Hello, Ivy) and she punches her lights out (Bye, Ivy). The sun begins to rise on Metropolis, Catwoman is with Krypto and Batman is on a gargoyle speaking with Superman. Clark says that Bruce could have hurt Lois, Batman answers that he knew Superman would react as he did.</p><p>Superman: But still, you might have hurt Lois</p><p>Batman: No, I believed in you.</p><p>Superman: All the good work including the JLA.</p><p>Batman: Meaning?</p><p>Superman: (smiles) Always the detective?</p><p>Batman: Ever the boy scout</p><p>Superman: (shakes hand) Thanks now more than ever, I know I gave the ring to the right person.</p><p>Batman: What are friends for?</p><p>A bandaged figure on a distant roof with binoculars: \"What are friends for?\" Ha Ha Ha</p><h2>Part 5: Opera</h2><p>Bruce Wayne is back in Gotham and Alfred straightens Bruce's bow tie. He is attending an opera which he doesn't like. Selina Kyle is there too and so is Tommy Elliot and Dr. <a href=\"/leslie-thompkins/4005-3740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3740\">Leslie Thompkins</a>. They enter the balcony and Tommy helps Leslie to the chair. The show begins and a figure in robes was banging a drum. Bruce and Selina became a bit suspicious then the figure bursts out of the robes and was really <a href=\"/harley-quinn/4005-1696/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1696\">Harley Quinn</a>. A gang of masked men come out with guns. Harley leaps acrobatically to the balcony and grabs a necklace Tommy is wearing she then shoots them and jumps away. Tommy goes after Harley, Bruce is missing and Leslie asks what Selina is keeping in her purse since it looks heavy. Tommy has a flashback of both childhood him and Bruce playing Bruce sees the necklace and jokes to dip it in water. Tommy explains that it is mother's necklace. Batman comes in uses a smoke grenade, mace and razor sharp batarangs to stop them. He goes after Quinn, then Catwoman swings in and kicks Harley. They both fight and Catwoman gets seriously injured and falls of the stage prop. Batman catches her on stage and the spectators clap thinking that its all part of the show. Leslie comes on stage with a medical bag telling Batman that she will help her while he goes after Harley. Tommy is still running after Harley but she has already dropped the bag with the necklace. Batman runs after them and finds that they are out of the Opera house. Batman runs through the rain and into an alley way and comes across (No) Tommy's corpse shot dead and the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a> near it with a....gun.</p><p>Batman goes mad and contemplates on killing the Joker this time. He begins to strangle the Joker and meanwhile on the roof a bandaged figure is watching this. The police force arrives at the Opera house with <a href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Jim Gordon</a>. He gets a call from the bandaged man telling him to come to the back. Gordon does so and sees Batman strangling him. Gordon stops Batman from doing it and allows the Joker to be sent to Arkham Asylum. Batman deals with Tommy's death and at his funeral Dick asks whether he should reveal his identity to Selina. At Arkham the bandaged figure come in and tears it off revealing it to be a bald <a href=\"/two-face/4005-5555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\">Harvey Dent</a> with no scars. He has the Joker released because he believes him to be innocent. At the Batcave, Alfred is tending some of Bruce's injuries and Catwoman is there and she asks about them. She sees a particular one on his chest where their is scratches. Batman (you don't remember?) it was the one she gave to him during their earlier encounters. He then reveals his identity to her.</p><p>*[I haven't read the issue where the events in paragraph 2 takes place, most of them</p><p>are important events mentioned on the internet.]</p><h2>Part 6: The Assassins</h2><p>It's a dark night over the skies of Metropolis. Lexcorp 1 is making a routine flight out of Metropolis. The <a href=\"/batplane/4055-49918/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-49918\">Batplane</a> is flying behind it. (Oracle, I'm in position), Batman presses a button and a device comes out and shoots a cable at Lexcorp 1. (Even for you, this is crazy, you got civilians in there Batman) Batman does not listen to her and swings down the rope. Batman thinks about his talk with Lucius about the design in the Lexcorp 1 and how it's similar to the Wayne Tech aircrafts. Batman places a gadgets near the hull and the cabin door opens. The plane begins to de-pressurize and Oracle jams their distress call. The guards confronts Batman who beats them easily. Batman had only seconds left before the cabin door re seals (by then I will have came for.) Talia. She was on the plane and Batman takes her out of the plane and jumps. Batman releases his parachute and Talia asks why he is doing this (Ask your father.). They parachute down into the bat boat. Batman believes it's <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/4005-40816/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\">Ras Al Ghul</a> who is responsible for all that is happening. He has kidnapped Talia to get his attention. Some after midnight, <a href=\"/pete-ross/4005-3771/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3771\">Pete Ross</a> runs into President Lex Luther's office explaining there's been a kidnapping and hijacking on Lexcorp 1. Pete explains that it was Batman and asks whether he wants to take action. Lex smiles and says (Not...yet). Batman returns to the Bat cave leaving Talia elsewhere. He comes in to find a sword embedded on the computer console. Batman picks up the sword and (\"If he accompanied by any of his League of Assassins..then\") Batman screams Alfred he runs up the stair case and out of the cave. To his relief Alfred was safe, they have a conversation and Alfred suggests that Ra's Al Ghul might want to draw Batman to his homeland and leave something or someone unprotected. Somewhere in Gotham, Catwoman is holding Talia hostage. Talia says she knows about Catwoman and Batman and she can never have him. Catwoman replies she's gone through life without having to have someone. Catwoman was thinking about gagging Talia when <a href=\"/lady-shiva/4005-2222/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2222\">Lady Shiva</a> comes in through the window. Catwoman jumps at her only to be kicked back. In North Africa, Ra's Al Ghul is sitting in a desert with a sword. Batman comes there and Ra's claims that he is not responsible for Batman's misfortunes. (You have means opportunity and knowledge only a few possess about my personal life.) Ra's then makes a deal with Batman, if Batman is able to defeat Ra's then he will help him solve his problems however if Ra's wins, Talia is to be released and Batman will be executed. Batman attacks Ra's first and Batman remembers the small pewter war games he used to play with Tommy. Ra's then tells Batman to show his true self. In Gotham City, Jim Gordon is asleep when a noise seems to bother him, suddenly he takes out his gun and (Hands in the air you think you can break into my home...) sees Harvey Dent with plastic surgery. Gordon says it will take more than plastic surgery to make him believe Harvey's changed sides.</p><p>Harvey: Is that it, Jimbo? No second chances?</p><p>Gordon: In your case you've gotten seconds, third and fourth chances and you burned them all.</p><p>Harvey: Okay, I deserved that but I didn't come here tonight for me. It's Bats and he needs our help more than ever.</p><p>Gordon: I heard about the stunt you pulled at Arkham getting the Joker released posing as his attorney.</p><p>Harvey: I had my license reinstated by the state. The Joker was innocent, you know that. The phone call that told you to go there, tell me you didn't recognize my voice?</p><p>Gordon: What the hell do you want?</p><p>Harvey: The gun that killed Tommy Elliot. When it's found it will be traced back to you. It's your service revolver. The one you turned in when you retired. It's all part of a game. The question is how long do you want to play?</p><p>Catwoman and Lady Shiva continue their fight and Shiva matches her move for move and shatters the lenses on Catwoman's mask. She suffers serious injuries and Shiva kicks her into a pile of boxes. Catwoman laid near death and Shiva was about to kill her when, Talia hits her in the head with a chair. Shiva falls unconscious and Talia uses Shiva's grapnel to get out of there. Meanwhile Ra's slashes Batman's arm with with his sword. Ra's says the people who manipulated Batman this way should be commended and once again calls it a game. Batman in a fit of rage declares (This.Is. Not.A.) and slashes Ra's forehead (Game!). Batman stabs Ra's in the side and Ra's falls down defeated. The League of Assassins rises from the sand with guns pointed at Batman, Batman offers Ra's the chance to get to Lazurus Pit then waste time watching Batman fight his Assassins.Without any other option,Ra's agrees and tells Batman that a Lazarus Pit has been tempered with and asks Batman to ask him self \"who do you want, back from the dead?\". Batman returns to Catwoman's apartment to find her seriously wounded but her life is saved thanks to Talia who had returned moments after she left. Talia tells Batman that she has given Catwoman herbs that will heal her wounds and with that she kisses Batman and leaves.</p><h2>Part 7: The Grave</h2><p>Back at the Batcave, Alfred is tending to Batman's wounds while Catwoman is shocked and amazed at how many scars and wounds Bruce has. Catwoman then asks Batman about a mark on his chest in which he recalls that Catwoman made it awhile back when she was still in her old costume. After Alfred is done,Catwoman kisses Batman and tells him that \"its to make it all better\". As Batman walks away after,Catwoman turns to Alfred and asks why does he keep doing it. Alfred then says that it is difficult to say and proceeds to tell Catwoman that her presence here has helped him a lot and although Batman may not say it, thinks the world of her. Catwoman then joins Batman as he fixes his computer system. Batman asks Catwoman whats different when all this started,Catwoman says \"us\" but before they continue they are interrupted by Robin who engages Catwoman in a fight telling her that she doesn't belong here. Batman stops the fight and reveals to Robin that he brought her here and that she knows Batman is Bruce Wayne. Catwoman then leaves the cave as she does not want to trip any of Batman's strings/connections. She then takes one of the motorcycles and leaves out of the cave. After she is gone, it is revealed that the fight was staged and that Robin had already known about Batman's decision and the fight was done to see if he could truly trust Catwoman. As Catwoman arrives in Gotham, she meets Huntress who quickly engages in a battle with her seeing Catwoman as her Helena Wayne counterpart. Batman and Robin watch the fight from afar and Batman leaves Robin to assist Catwoman. As Batman leaves, Robin is knocked out from behind. Batman throws Catwoman an injection needle to sedate Huntress who upon being injected is unconscious. Batman and Catwoman are then attacked by The <a href=\"/scarecrow/4005-3726/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3726\">Scarecrow</a> who rides on Huntress motorcycle. Batman leaps on top of it and The Scarecrow crashes into a grave yard. Batman then beats Scarecrow who is shocked that his fear gas did not work saying Batman had been effected by another but before he can finished he is knocked out by a batarang coming from the figure who knocked out Robin and now has him hostage. The figure then cuts the bandages of his face and reveals him self to be <a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd</a>.</p><h2>Part 8: The Game</h2><p>Batman is shocked to see an alive Jason Todd who is also holding Robin as a hostage. As Jason is threatening the life of Robin, Catwoman arrives and binds Jason's hands with her whip allowing Robin to escape. In a heartbeat Batman engages Jason in battle, after being knocked down Batman stabs Jason in the leg with a batarang and Jason starts to bleed. Jason then attempts to escape and flips over Batman but Batman launches his grapple and soon follows. Catwoman also attempts to follow but is stopped by Robin who says he needs to this alone. Catwoman then reminds Robin of what Batman's like when hes angry and what if Jason turns out to be fake. Over the top of a building, Batman has Jason at the ledge and continues to punch him and eventually it is revealed that the Jason Todd is really <a href=\"/clayface/4005-9589/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9589\">Clayface</a> in disguise. Clayface who is beaten and unable to hold his form melts down from the bulding above. Robin arrives and asks Batman how he knew in which Batman explained that the imposter never called him Bruce which would have confirmed it and that while he was standing on the grave there was clay beneath him. Catwoman then arrives and apologizes that it wasn't Jason in which he replies he wished it was because the people who are responsible are still out there. Batman goes to Oracle's clock tower where she reveals that there a subliminal message planted in his computer to call Thomas Elliot when he had seriously wounded him self. Batman then figures out who could have access to the bat cave and put the message there. Batman with the help of Oracle tracks down Harold who was Batman's old mechanic and helped him with alot of his equipment. As Batman confronts Harold it is revealed that Harold is no longer mute. Harold has reluctantly betrayed Batman wanting to have the ability to talk and have the chance to be happy, discovering this Batman forgives Harold telling him that Happiness can be a powerful thing to exploit. Batman then asks Harold who did this to him but before Harold can answer he is shot in the head. Batman turns around to see a Bandaged covered man similar to the disguise Jason Todd was wearing at the grave before. The bandaged covered man quotes Aristotle saying \"What is a friend? a single soul dwelling in two bodies?\"</p><h2>Part 9:The End</h2><p>As Batman craddle's Harold dead body in the pouring rain the masked bandaged figure who is referred to as Hush holds Batman at gun point. Hush begins to shoot at Batman but Batman avoids the bullets by using his grapple to go upwards. Batman throws several batarangs at Hush but Hush is able to shoot all of them and Batman suspects that he could have been trained by <a href=\"/deadshot/4005-5763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5763\">Deadshot</a>. As Batman uses his grapple again to swing to the side, Hush is able to shoot the line causing Batman to fall. Batman lifts him self up and glides towards Hush position and kicks him directly at the face saying \"the game ends here tonight\". Batman begins to punch Hush in the face and finds his friend Tommy Elliot's jade pendant that Tommy's mother gave him to him as a child around Hushes neck. Hush smacks Batman in the face with the handle on his gun and recounts to him the story in which Tommy and Bruce were just kids and Bruce took it as a joke. Tommy got mad and beat Bruce up yelling \"Give it back\". Hush then strangles Batman on the floor, Batman who is tired of all the deceptions reaches for Hushes mask but Hush smacks his hands saying \"you don't get to peek yet\". Batman kicks Hush off of him and yells \"Why hide your face??\". Hush then recounts the story of how Tommy Elliots parents died on a bridge similar to the one their standing on when their car breaks didnt work and they died in a car crash. Thomas Wayne who was Batman's father had saved Tommys mother but not his father. Batman attacks Hush saying that Thomas Wayne did everything he could to save him, Hush tells him to stick a needle (a line that Bruce and Tommy use to say to each other as kids). As Batman punches Hush again, he asks Hush if his motive all this time was to exact revenge on him for his father failing to save Tommy's father. Hush reveals that that was not his motive, instead he wanted to exact revenge because he envied all the weatlth Bruce had and wanted it all for him self. He reveals that the night his parents died, it was Tommy who severed their break lines causing them to be involved the car crash. Hush wanted revenge not because Batman's father had failed to save his father but because he prevented the death of his mother. Tommy had to wait for his mother to die years later of cancer before he could get their wealth. Batman who is distracted by the story is unable to dodge an explosion from behind him caused by a bomb planted by Hush on the Batmobile while Batman was distracted with Harold. As Hush is about to kill Batman, Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordan arrive. Hush is suprised to see Harvey and yells about an agreement they made but Harvey responds by shooting Hush twice causing him to fall of the bridge. Batman dives in after him but doesn't find anything. Batman climbs back onto the bridge where Harvey reveals that hes no longer Two-Face. Harvey also reveals that Hush is definitely Tommy Elliot and the one who was shot by Joker was really Clayface. Harvey also reveals that his surgery was done by Tommy Elliot in exchange for shooting the Clayface disguised as him. Two weeks later Catwoman finds Huntress and tells her that Tommy Elliot is dead again in which she replies \"good....bastard\". Back at the Batcave, Superman and Batman meet where Superman tells him that he didnt find anything in the rivers. Batman then asks Superman to use his microscopic vision on him and Superman finds a chip implanted in Batman at the base of his skull. Batman then tells Superman to burn it. After that, Batman goes to Arkhum Asylum to meet with the <a href=\"/riddler/4005-3718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\">Riddler</a>.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/absolute-batman-hush/4050-37322/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37322\">Absolute Batman: Hush</a></li><li><a href=\"/batman-hush/4050-27384/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27384\">Batman: Hush</a></li><li><a href=\"/batman-hush-vol-1/4050-35076/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35076\">Batman: Hush Vol. 1</a></li><li><a href=\"/batman-hush-vol-2/4050-35096/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35096\">Batman: Hush Vol. 2</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/batman-608-special-edition-/4000-205474/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-205474\">Batman #608 Special Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"/wizard-the-comics-magazine-0-wizard-zero/4000-110476/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-110476\">Wizard: The Comics Magazine #0 - Wizard Zero</a> - contains an 8-page original story by Jeph Loeb and the rest of the creative team behind <em>Hush</em>, which is set between <a href=\"/batman-616-hush-chapter-nine-the-assasins/4000-91385/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-91385\">Batman #616 - Hush Chapter Nine: The Assasins</a> and <a href=\"/batman-617-hush-chapter-ten-the-grave/4000-91386/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-91386\">Batman #617 - Hush Chapter Ten : The Grave</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batman-tiho/4050-68977/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-68977\">Batman: Tiho!</a></li></ul>",

While the location of this planet is not known exactly, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">    Doctor Doom</a> believes that it is in orbit of a star that is the last star of the galaxy that they are in.  There is immediate turmoil among the villains as they begin to fight with one another.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\" href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" slug=\"ultron\">    Ultron</a> makes a first strike against <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\">    Galactus</a> and is drained of all his energy for his trouble.  The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\" href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" slug=\"beyonder\">    Beyonder</a> then tells them to fight and that the victorious group shall be granted all that they desire.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\">    Galactus</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">    Doctor Doom</a> immediately attempt an attack on the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\" href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" slug=\"beyonder\">    Beyonder</a> in an attempt to seize his power for their own, but they are swatted away like flies.  The heroes are in awe, having witnessed this display of power and realizing how easily he defeated two of their greatest enemies.</p><p>The two groups are then transported to the planet surface with the exception of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\">    Galactus</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">    Doctor Doom</a> who land there after being knocked back by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\" href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" slug=\"beyonder\">    Beyonder</a>.  The heroes immediately attempt to attack <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\" href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" slug=\"magneto\">    Magneto</a>, but rather than fight, he repels himself into the sky by riding the magnetic waves of the planet.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">    Doctor Doom</a> finds a fortress and hopes to rally the villains to stand against the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\" href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" slug=\"beyonder\">    Beyonder</a>, but they rebel against his plan and so he sets out to obtain the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\" href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" slug=\"beyonder\">    Beyonder</a>'s power for his own.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\" href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" slug=\"kang\">    Kang</a> witnesses <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">    Doctor Doom</a> attempt to leave and uses weaponry available in the fortress to blast <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">    Doctor Doom</a> out of the sky.  Doom conveniently crashes near the heroes, followed shortly by the group of angered villains and the first battle of the series ensues.</p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><a href=\"///\"> </a><b>Prisoners of War</b> <br/>As his allies do battle with the heroes, Doom attempts to take council with Galactus, but is ignored.  He then goes back to the fortress to see what kind of technology has been provided for the Beyonder's victims to use in the war game.  He makes quick work of the fortress' defense systems and discovers an inert <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\" href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" slug=\"ultron\">    Ultron</a>.  Meanwhile, the heroes defeat several of the villains, and the remnants flee from the battle.  In need of a place to detain the captured villains, the heroes discover that a fortress has been provided for them as well.  Rather than press their advantage, they decide to regroup and prepare for a long series of battles by learning about their new, temporary headquarters.  Magneto finds yet a third fortress, located hundreds of miles away from the other two and plans his next move as well.<p>The villains return to their fortress only to be assaulted by Doctor Doom and a rebuilt Ultron that now serves him.  Under their combined might, the remaining villains are subjugated and agree to obey Doom's leadership.  Meanwhile, the heroes attack Magneto at yet the power plant and Wasp is captured by Magneto during his retreat.  During the confrontation, Thing discovers that he is able to revert to his human form.</p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><a href=\"///\"> </a><b>Tempest Without, Crisis Within</b> <br/>Magneto takes Wasp back to his fortress and the two are trapped there as the weather in his section of the world changes and prevents them from leaving.  Spider-Man overhears Charles Xavier (now able to walk) and the X-Men planning to leave the heroes and join with Magneto and attempts to intervene and stop them.  Spider-Man attempts to report the activities of the X-Men to the Avengers, but has his memory altered by Xavier before he can do so.<p>Doctor Doom suggests an alliance with Magneto, but is turned down.  Magneto then returns to Wasp and the two share a moment while the storm rages outside.  At Doombase, Doctor Doom begins experimenting on Skeeter (who was not previously mentioned in the series) and grants her new powers.  With her new powers, she chooses a new name and becomes Titania.  The second subject that Doom experiments on is granted the power to project plasma and chooses the name Volcana.</p><p>Thor frees Enchantress and the two depart to have a moment away from the mortals.  At dawn, Doom leads an assault against the heroes' base with the remaining villains and manages to catch the heroes off guard.  Using their advantage, they force the heroes to regroup while the prisoners are freed.  The heroes' base is destroyed but the villains discover that the heroes managed to escape while checking the wreckage.</p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><a href=\"///\"> </a><b>Situation: Hopeless</b> <br/>The villains quickly spot the fleeing group and use their combined might to throw a mountain on the heroes.  Thor and Enchantress are interrupted by the concussion of the falling mountain and return to the ruins of the heroes' base only to appear in the middle of the villains.  Thor takes on the villains single-handedly but is defeated and vanishes, leaving only his helmet.  Doom then orders Ultron to kill Kang for his earlier attempt to take Doom's life.<p>The X-Men arrive at Magneto's stronghold and form an alliance with their former enemy.  Magneto then reveals that he believes the heroes should take an aggressive role and do as the Beyonder requests: kill the villains and claim the prize.  Wasp then compares him to Hitler and flees from the base.  Meanwhile, the heroes are revealed to have survived the mountain toss, as Hulk caught it on his back and prevented it from crushing the group.  Iron Man's armour was damaged, and with Hulk only able to hold the mountain up, they are effectively trapped.  Mr. Fantastic then uses Hawkeye's arrows and Spider-Man's web shooters to repair Iron Man's armour and he blasts an escape path through the mountain.  As they exit, Thor returns to the group, explaining that he hid his escape with a flash of lightning.  The heroes then regroup to a village that was brought to the planet, but are concerned with Galactus who is standing on top of a nearby mountain.</p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><a href=\"///\"> </a><b>The Battle of the Four Armies</b> <br/>Galactus then moves, and summons his ship to the planet.  Seeing the ship in the sky, Magneto and the X-Men leap begin making their way to Galactus.  Also seeing the ship, Doom begins preparing the villains for battle as well.  Charles Xavier and Magneto attempt a combined psychic attack on Galactus while Mr. Fantastic attempts to distract him.  Galactus unleashes a robot from his ship to fight Captain America's faction while repelling the psychic attack.  The America faction defeats the robot, but not without leaving several members of the team incapacitated.  It is then that the Doom faction steps in and attacks the heroes.  The heroes are hard pressed, and in danger of being defeated when Magneto and the X-Men arrive.  While Galactus is distracted by the battle at his feet, Doom sneaks on board Galactus' ship.  Eventually the Doom faction is driven back, but Colossus is gravely wounded.  Magneto and the X-Men depart, leaving Colossus behind (not without protest of several of the X-Men).  Galactus continues to construct his world devouring machine, unhindered.<p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><a href=\"///\"> </a><b>A Little Death...</b> <br/>Wasp begins making her way back to the America faction.  Doom, exploring Galactus' ship, discovers Klaw, the self-styled master of sound.  With new orders from Doom, Klaw returns to the villains.  Xavier takes a moment to rest his legs while the X-Men survey the damage done to their base by Galactus' psychic attack.  While resting, Xavier stretches out with his mind and touches the minds of the villains, ascertaining their new plan.  He then orders the X-Men into action.  Storm, unhappy with Xavier's new direct leadership role, confronts him.  Xavier then tells her that he would go so far as to alter the memories of the X-Men to prevent insubordination.  Meanwhile, Colossus begins to show interest in an alien woman named Zsaji but she is whisked away by the Human Torch.  The villains arrive at a volcano and begin setting Doom's plan into motion but are attacked by the remaining X-Men.  During the fight Molecule Man is seriously injured by Wolverine and the villains flee.  Cyclops, realizing that their plan was most likely to harm Galactus, fires his optic beam into a region of volcanoes, igniting them.  In an unexpected turn, Wasp is then shot and killed by Wrecker as the villains make their way back to Doombase.<p><b><a href=\"///\"> </a></b></p><b><a href=\"///\"> </a>Berserker</b> <br/>Spider-Woman joins Captain America's faction, having been uprooted from earth during the construction of the planet.  The Wrecking Crew tosses Wasp's body into the village as they continue towards Doombase.  Zsaji, the healer, attempts to help Wasp but it is too late.  While the Avengers try to decide their next course of action, the X-Men continue to pursue the fleeing villains. <h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-33054\" href=\"/new-avengers-illuminati/4050-33054/\" slug=\"new-avengers-illuminati\">New Avengers: Illuminati</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-28160\" href=\"/secret-wars-omnibus/4050-28160/\" slug=\"secret-wars-omnibus\">    Secret Wars Omnibus</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-27491\" href=\"/she-hulk-superhuman-law/4050-27491/\" slug=\"she-hulk-superhuman-law\">    She-Hulk: Superhuman Law</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-34180\" href=\"/spider-man-and-the-secret-wars/4050-34180/\" slug=\"spider-man-and-the-secret-wars\">    Spider-Man and the Secret Wars</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-270054\" href=\"/thing-classic-volume-one/4000-270054/\" slug=\"thing-classic-volume-one\">Thing Classic</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-28948\" href=\"/what-if-secret-wars/4050-28948/\" slug=\"what-if-secret-wars\">    What If?

Over the years, her mental instability and subsequent lack of control over the immense reality-manipulating power she wields have put herself, those closest to her, and the general public in imminent danger. Together the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>, as well as Avengers, new and old, decide that she is too dangerous to live, and that something must be done before reality itself is undone by her madness. Of all those heroes involved only <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> seeks to preserve his sister. <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> is absent because when he heard of his daughter's breakdown he rescued her and remains reclusive on the island nation of <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a> while she recuperates.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19940/662158-quicksliver_hom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-662158\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5044642857143\" data-width=\"224\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 224px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19940/662158-quicksliver_hom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-662158\"><img alt=\"Quicksilver during the House of M\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19940/662158-quicksliver_hom.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19940/662158-quicksliver_hom.jpg 224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px\" data-width=\"224\"></a><figcaption>Quicksilver during the House of M</figcaption></figure><p>As the heroes make their way to where Wanda is being held, <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> rushes to his sister's side. Awakening her, he tells her of the plot to kill her and that she needs to use her powers to save them. Suddenly, a white flash over-takes the world, and reality is flipped upside down. The Scarlet Witch has remade reality in the views of <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">Mutant</a> superiority over humans formerly held by her father. In this new, alternate reality mutants are the majority, with normal Homo sapiens are in the minority. Sapiens (sapes, as the slur goes) are now also second class citizens, suffering the ridicule, indignity, and the same constant fear of persecution that mutants had to endure for so long. Mutants now hold positions of authority in business, as well as the highest offices in the world's military and governmental bodies.</p><p>Of the world's population only two remember life before House of M. <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>'s mind rejected this new reality from the beginning.

The other person in this reality who initially understood that the accepted truth was fake was the child <a href=\"/layla-miller/4005-1447/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1447\">Layla Miller</a>. Layla has the fortuitous ability of being able to re-activate people's memories of their past life, as well as their lives in the new House of M reality, granting them the ability to understand that the world they now belong to is fake.</p><p>Before long, Layla had assembled a group who were going to assault <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> (the beloved global dictator in the House of M reality).

    "deck": "The prelude to the alternate reality \"Age of Apocalypse\", \"Legion Quest\" followed the story of Professor X's son Legion, who attempted to realize his father's dreams by killing his worst enemy.",
    "description": "<h2>A Son's Revenge</h2><p>David Haller ( <a href=\"/legion/4005-13349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13349\">Legion</a>), son of Charles Xavier ( <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a>) and Israeli diplomat <a href=\"/gabrielle-haller/4005-15049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15049\">Gabrielle Haller</a>, had spent many years of his schizophrenic life in a coma following a battle between the <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\">Shadow King</a> (who had possessed David) and the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>. Suddenly, in a response to the presence of <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a>, David awakes, his fractured mind healed into one single personality with one single goal -- to help his father achieve his goals of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants. David targets Erik Lehnsherr ( <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>) as the true adversary to Xavier achieving his dream. His solution is to travel back in time approximately 20 years and murder Magneto before he adopts his anti-human policies and becomes Professor X's enemy.</p><h2>Battle For The Past</h2><p>A team of X-Men, consisting of <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a>, and <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a>, arrive in Israel in order to stop Legion, who has destroyed everything the Israeli army has thrown at him. In the ensuing battle, Storm realizes Legion's plan, but only after Bishop is knocked unconscious attempting to absorb some of Legion's powers. Storm orders Psylocke to mind-link to Bishop, who still possesses some of Legion's chronal energy, causing the X-Men (with the exception of Jean Grey, who had telekinetically anchored herself) to teleport along with Legion. Before she passes out, though, Jean is able to contact Professor X and the rest of the X-Men in order to alert them to Legion's plan.</p><h2>Back In Time</h2><p>The four X-Men and Legion arrive safely in the past, though the time travel erases all five of the mutants' memories. Legion arrives at the hospital at which both Xavier and Magneto, both young and friends, work. Following a touch from Magneto, Legion experiences a psychic backlash that causes him to project visions of Magneto's past. Magneto gets angry and storms out and Legion apologizes, but this energy starts to awaken Legion's memory. In the present, Jean Grey, Professor X, and <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a> pool their energies and send Cable back in time to alert the four time-stranded X-Men, who had got jobs working at the docks. Cable appears to them and, although they don't recognize him, Bishop thinks he looks familiar and touches him, causing the temporal energy surrounding Cable to reach the others, awakening their memories as well.</p><h2>Battle For The Future</h2><p>Legion, disguised as his father, Xavier, appears to Gabrielle Haller at the hospital. He seduces her. At the docks, Xavier gets a psychic warning, alerting him that something is wrong with Gabrielle. With Magneto in tow, he runs to the hospital to find Gabrielle disheveled, on the floor, clothes torn. Suddenly, Legion appears behind the two men and threatens Magneto. The X-Men, memories restored, quickly rush to the scene of the fight, only to find Magneto and Legion locked in battle high above in the sky. Bishop and Iceman work on controlling the damage, while Storm and Psylocke attempts to find Xavier. Iceman, who finds himself much more powerful tries to defeat Legion, but to no avail. Legion grabs the defeated Magneto and starts to deliver his murderous blow, but at the last moment, Xavier throws himself in the way of the blast, getting killed instantly, but saving the life of his friend in the process. With Xavier's death, Legion and the X-Men disappear. Only Bishop remained, due to the fact that he was a time traveler and, therefore, a chronal anomaly in the first place. Magneto, defeated but alive, is left to cradle the lifeless body of his friend, Charles Xavier.</p><h2>Effects</h2><p>With Xavier out of the picture, the <a href=\"/\">Age of Apocalypse</a> is ushered in and dominates the X-books for four months.</p><h2>Associated Issues</h2><p>Though it is not a part of the official canon of Legion Quest, <a href=\"/x-factor-promised-vengeance/4000-65689/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-65689\">X-Factor #108</a> is an important read because it chronicles when Legion actually wakes from his coma. Then proceed to the Prelude before reading X-Factor #109. After that, there is a vignette in <a href=\"/x-men-birds-of-a-feather/4000-65740/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-65740\">X-Men #39</a> of Legion wandering the Israeli desert and receiving instructions from <a href=\"/destiny/4005-3557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3557\">Destiny</a>. The story then picks up with the first numbered issue of Legion Quest in Uncanny X-Men #320.</p><p>An anomaly with this arc is that seven issues are included but only four are numbered as such. It's possible that this is because the events of the non-numbered issues happen concurrently. Or, that Marvel only numbered the X-Men titles for some reason.<br /><br /></p><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/what-if-77-what-if-legion-had-killed-magneto/4000-41389/\">What If...? #77 - What if Legion Had Killed Magneto</a>?</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/what-if-x-men-age-of-apocalypse/4050-25127/\">What If?

    "description": "<p>This is the initial 1602-story arc. If you want to see all the stories linked to this story arcs continuity, go to its <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/1602/4015-56260/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56260\">concept page</a>.</p><h2>Basic Concept</h2><p>1602 poses an alternate history to Marvel's Earth-616.

The story follows Sir Nicholas Fury, the students from Carlos Javier's Select College for the Sons of Gentlefolk, Rojhaz the American Indian and others, as they attempt to decipher the riddle of strange and deadly weather patterns and foil the machinations of Count Otto Von Doom.</p><p>Eventually, the main characters discover that Earth-616 is coming apart in a para-temporal event caused by the untimely arrival of Steve Rogers, commonly known as Captain America, of Earth-460 having been sent more than 400 years back through time. They foil Von Doom's schemes and rescue the Four of the Fantastick, then head to America where they finally seal the rift by sending Captain America back through, and return Earth-616 to its proper timeline.</p><p>This reality has been named Earth-311.</p><h2>The characters</h2><p>The characters of Earth-311 are not alternate reality counterparts of Earth-616 characters, but analogues.</p><p>The following is a list of the characters, who they are on Earth-311, and who they are analogues of in Earth-616.</p><ul><li>Elizabeth I of England: Herself*</li><li>James I of England: Himself*</li><li><a href=\"/virginia-dare/4005-55179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55179\">Virginia Dare</a>: No counterpart</li><li>Uatu, the Watcher: Himself*</li><li>Sir Nicholas Fury: Nick Fury*</li><li>Doctor Stephen Strange: Himself*</li><li>Peter Parquagh: Peter Parker (Spider-man)*</li><li>Matthew Murdoch: Matt Murdock (Daredevil)*</li><li>Clea Strange: Clea*</li><li>Rojhaz: Steve Rogers (Captian America)*</li><li>Carlos Javier: Charles Xavier*</li><li>The Four from the Fantastick: Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), Sue Storm (Invisible Woman), John Storm (Human Torch), Ben Grimm (The Thing)*</li><li>Grand Inquisitor Enrique: Erik Magnus Lehnsherr (Magneto)*</li><li>David Banner: Bruce Banner (The Hulk)*</li><li>Count Otto von Doom: Victor Von Doom (Dr. Doom)*</li><li>Pestros: Pietro Django Maximoff (Quicksilver)*</li><li>Scotius Summerisle: Scott Summers (Cyclops)*</li><li>Robert Trefusis: Robert Drake (Iceman)*</li><li>John (Jean) Grey: Jean Grey*</li><li>Werner: Warren Worthington III (Angel)*</li><li>Master McCoy: Henry McCoy (Beast)*</li><li>Sister Wanda: Wanda Django Maximoff (Scarlet Witch)</li></ul><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/marvel-1602/4050-31889/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-31889\">Marvel 1602</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/100-marvel-1602-1-donde-las-cosas-comienzan-a-camb/4000-283223/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-283223\">100% Marvel. 1602 #1</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/100-marvel-1602-2-donde-se-pantea-una-traicion/4000-283224/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-283224\">100% Marvel. 1602 #2</a> (Spain)</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "deck": "Hulk gets trapped on another planet by the Illuminati where he overthrows the emperor and becomes their king. This story leads into the World War Hulk event.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The Illuminati (a group consisting of Tony Stark, Reed Richards, Black Bolt, Namor, and Dr. Stephen Strange only – Charles Xavier was absent) meet to discuss the recent destruction of Hulk and how to deal with him. The decision to deposit Hulk on a peaceful uninhabited planet is interrupted by a wormhole, placing the savage Hulk on the violent planet Sakaar.</p><p>The green skinned warrior quickly bonds with others like him in a gladiator arena, as well as creates an enemy of Red King. Through his conflicts and troubles Hulk unites a planet by killing the tyrant king, while finding a kindred spirit and falls in love with the warrior Caiera. Hulk, the savior of the people, is crowned king with Caiera as his queen. The peace does not last for the green goliath however, but instead leads to the destruction of Sakaar and the terribly destructive World War Hulk.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>Prelude to Planet Hulk</h3><p>After Hulk's rampage where most of Las Vegas was destroyed, <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> has exiled himself into the northern wilderness in an attempt to keep himself from harming other living beings. Banner is approached by <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a> for a mission that will have Hulk go into space to destroy a rogue, sentient Hydra satellite with the capability of detonating every nuke on earth. Banner agrees, and as Hulk is sent into space to deal with the satellite. There, Hulk finds a dead crew and the computer takes on humanoid form. This machine appears to be able to match Hulk's strength, but Hulk is able to get the better of it and destroy it. Hulk is infuriated when he discovers that Fury lied to him about the satellite which is actually one of <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a>'s own. A message begins playing of the members of the <a href=\"/illuminati/4060-40421/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40421\">Illuminati</a> telling Hulk that he has been tricked, and is being exiled to an uninhabited far-off planet where he cannot hurt anyone and can finally live in peace. The ship was sucked into a portal and deposited Hulk on the violent planet <a href=\"/sakaar/4020-41069/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41069\">Sakaar</a>. Traveling through the wormhole has weakened Hulk, leaving his strength depleted and with the ability to sustain injury. Unable to resist Hulk is captured almost immediately upon arrival, and is forced to become a gladiator in the great arena for the viewing pleasure of the evil <a href=\"/red-king/4005-14846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14846\">Red King</a> of Sakaar.</p><h3>Sakaarson</h3><p>Hulk is forced to battle the Silver Surfer in the gladiatorial arena. The Surfer had also been weakened when he was drawn through the wormhole that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk recognized the Surfer, and rather than fight him for the Red King's amusement, Hulk smashed the control unit that kept the Surfer in check, allowing him to flee Sakaar and make his way to the events of the <a href=\"/annihilation/4045-41287/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41287\">Annihilation</a>. As a gladiator in the arena, Hulk quickly makes an enemy of the Red King. After watching Hulk win several battles the Red King dons his battle suit to fight the Hulk. Not to be underestimated Hulk draws blood from the Red Kings face, an act which was until then unprecedented. As a means to save face the Red King makes a deal with Hulk, offering to allow the Hulk to go free as long as he is able to pass a certain number of trials. The motive for this apparent display of leniency is to make it appear so that Hulk has a fighting chance of his freedom, but to be able to kill him anyway. It is during these trials that Hulk would meet and forge a warbond with several allies on Sakaar: <a href=\"/korg/4005-43225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43225\">Korg</a> the Kronan, <a href=\"/miek/4005-43226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43226\">Miek</a> the insect, the <a href=\"/no-name/4005-43277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43277\">No-name</a> Broodspawn, <a href=\"/hiroim/4005-43227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43227\">Hiroim</a> the Shamed shadow priest, and <a href=\"/elloe/4005-43228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43228\">Elloe</a>. These allies would become a force that could not be broken, no matter what trials the Red King threw their way. The more the Hulk was able to overcome, the more the people of Sakaar grew to support him. A growing number of the people of Sakaar also believed Hulk to be their fabled savior, the Sakaarson, after a plant was discovered to have sprung to life in the arena from where Hulk's blood touched the soil.</p><p>Hulk and his <a href=\"/warbound/4060-43240/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43240\">Warbound</a> allies eventually escaped the Red King's control and made their way into the wilderness. Enraged, the Red King is growing more and more impatient with the Hulk and tries even harder to kill him, first sending his armies after him and then sending his personal bodyguard <a href=\"/caiera/4005-42037/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42037\">Caiera</a>, the shadowguard. Caiera, harboring an ancient power known only to her people as the Oldstrong had not found a match in pure power until meeting the Hulk. It was while Hulk battled Caiera that the Red King had finally had enough of the Hulk and sent in his most dangerous weapon: a plague of sentient spores known as the Spikes which consumed all living organisms, turning them into spikes too. The threat of the Spikes is too great for Caiera and Hulk to continue battling each other, for now they are in a race for their lives just to avoid the Spikes. Many of those around them are turned into spikes as well including Miek's queen, the last hope for their race.</p><p>Coming back to battle the Red King once final time, Hulk is able to release the spike leaders who revealed that they are captives of the Red King that crash landed on Sakaar a long time ago and do not mean to harm anyone. Now with an army supporting him, Hulk confronts the Red King who is desperate and sets off a charge that will destroy the planet from the inside. Jumping into the destruction of Sakaar, Hulk grabs the plates of the planet and pulls them back into place himself. As the planet's savior, Hulk slays the Red King. Now would be a time for rebuilding.</p><h3>King Hulk</h3><p>After the events of the final battle against the Red King, Hulk is looked to as the leader. All was not well at first. Hulk's allies against the Red King are now fighting with each other in an attempt to decide what to do with the Red King gone. Meeting in the arena once more former teammates prepare to battle each other until Hulk steps in and says that if they want to fight they can fight him. The Shadow Priests watch from a distance believing the Hulk to be no better than the Red King. Hulk forces the opposition to attack him, plunging their spears, arrows, and swords into his flesh. Hulk declared that they are all warbound with each other as they had teamed up against him, and need not fight each other. This proved once again that regardless of whether Hulk is the Sakaarson or not, Hulk is a natural leader for Sakaar.</p><p>Hulk allows the Spikes to feed off of him during the day so that no one else is harmed while they work on a way to send the spikes back into space where they belong. In love with Caiera, Hulk and Caiera become married and Caiera reveals to Hulk that she is pregnant with his child. Hulk returns the Spikes to space, and finally becomes more comfortable with his role as the new king of Sakaar. A new era of peace looms on the horizon for Sakaar as old relationships are rekindled, and as the Warbound now work together with the people of Sakaar to rebuild what the Red King had destroyed. It seems as if everything is all right. This is proof of the toughness of Hulk. Even launched into space on a desolate, angry planet, he managed to prosper.</p><p>Everything seemed almost too good to be true when the ship the Hulk was brought to Sakaar on began to emit warnings that its power systems were failing. Hulk was not able to send the ship into the atmosphere in time, and an explosion rocked the world destroying virtually all life (including Caiera) and setting the planet up for its demise once again. Hulk is found by the Warbound, some of the only survivors of the planet's destruction, and with them plots a course back to Earth to seek out the Illuminati to make them pay for destroying their paradise. Let the <a href=\"/world-war-hulk/4045-42294/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42294\">World War Hulk</a> begin!</p><p>The events of Planet Hulk are continued in the <a href=\"/world-war-hulk/4045-42294/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42294\">World War Hulk</a> storyline, where Hulk returns to Earth with his Warbound allies to find the Illuminati. A lot has changed while Hulk was gone, and Hulk is angrier than ever...</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/civil-war-avengers/4050-35918/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35918\">Civil War: Avengers</a></li><li><a href=\"/incredible-hulk-planet-hulk/4050-31132/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-31132\">Incredible Hulk: Planet Hulk</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/planet-hulk-gladiator-guidebook/4050-20839/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20839\">Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-marvel-encyclopedia-the-definitive-guide-to-the-characters-of-the-marvel-universe-the-marvel-encyclopedia-the-definitive-guide-to-the-characters-of-the-marvel-universe/4000-217055/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-217055\">The Marvel Encyclopedia The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe Volume 2</a></li><li><a href=\"/what-if-planet-hulk/4050-19301/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19301\">What If?

Realizing they were on Earth, a world known to have countless superhumans, the escaped prisoners begin preparations for a hasty escape off-world.</p><p>The dimwitted Drax opposes his fellow escapees, but is murdered when Paibok assumes the form of Thanos (whom Drax was created to destroy), taking Drax off-guard just long enough to kill him. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41747\" href=\"/cammi/4005-41747/\" slug=\"cammi\">Cammi</a>, a local girl bargains with Paibok and somehow claims ownership of Drax’s body. She is rather surprised however when the body returns to life transformed. Drax had lost much of his power, but he has regained his intellect and received all the instincts and senses of a true warrior.</p><p>In short order, Drax kills Lunatik and one of the Blood Brothers before Paibok fearing for his own safety summons his former captors to take him back into custody. Paibok, Drax, and Cammi are all escorted off-planet aboard the prison ship Dredge 02.</p><h2>Annihilation</h2><p>Events of the Annihilation are chronicled in terms of the Annihilation Day.</p><p><b>A.D. -7</b></p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4020-57682\" href=\"/crunch-cascade/4020-57682/\" slug=\"crunch-cascade\">The Crunch</a> lying at the center of the universe is the region in which all space expands from. The energies released by the Crunch have been used as a prison for countless millennia to contain criminals and unwanted entities from around the universe. This prison was called the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56324\" href=\"/the-kyln/4020-56324/\" slug=\"the-kyln\">Kyln</a>.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\" href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" slug=\"thanos\">Thanos</a> of Titan recently visited Kyln, he claimed the chaos mite <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42605\" href=\"/skreet/4005-42605/\" slug=\"skreet\">Skreet</a> as a pet and the seeming first herald of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\">Galactus</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40877\" href=\"/fallen-one/4005-40877/\" slug=\"fallen-one\">Fallen One</a> as his own herald. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\" href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" slug=\"death\">Death</a> (in the form of a young girl) appears to Thanos and tells him something wonderful will soon emerge from the Crunch.</p><p><b>Annihilation Day</b></p><p>An exceedingly large armada of starships manned by insectoid creatures emerges from the Crunch and lays waste to the Kyln. This large armada, dubbed the Annihilation Wave, follows one simple command: Extinguish life wherever they find it. Their lord, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\" href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" slug=\"annihilus\">Annihilus</a> has declared war upon our universe as it is always expanding while his <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\" href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" slug=\"the-negative-zone\">Negative Zone</a> is always contracted, which Annihilus sees as an invasion of his territory by our universe.</p><p><b>Annihilation Day 7</b></p><p>On <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56106\" href=\"/xandar/4020-56106/\" slug=\"xandar\">Xandar</a>, the Nova Corps convenes to prepare to confront the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55905\" href=\"/annihilation-wave/4060-55905/\" slug=\"annihilation-wave\">Annihilation Wave</a>, as they do the Wave attacks, a brief, but fierce battle Xandar is destroyed and all the Nova Corps are dead except one. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2105\" href=\"/nova/4005-2105/\" slug=\"nova\">Nova</a>, the Nova of Earth. Drax and Cammi, who arrived on Xandar the same day are able to escape death with the help of Drax’s finely tuned instincts. As Richard surveys the destruction Xandar he falls to his knees, defeated.</p><p><b>A.D. 11</b></p><p>Apparently having fallen into a coma, Nova recovers to the Xandarian Worldmind attempting to contact him. It is in danger of going offline. If the Worldmind be goes offline, the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-56037\" href=\"/nova-force/4015-56037/\" slug=\"nova-force\">Nova Force</a> itself and all that remains of Xandar’s knowledge and culture would also be lost forever. In order to maintain the Worldmind, Nova allows the Worldmind and all the power of the Nova Force to be downloaded into him.</p><p>Drunk on his newfound power, Nova sets out to destroy the Annihilation Wave, in the ensuing battle, he loses control of the power and nearly kills himself. Recovering in the crater he created when he crash-landed, he encounters the only other known survivors of the destruction of Xandar, Drax and Cammi.</p><p>The trio set out to find salvageable transport off Xandar. After some resistance from the Annihilation Wave’s carrion feeders, they are able to find a Nova Corps transport, which Nova interfaces with to order to open a stargate to escape the Annihilation Wave.</p><p>The ship arrives in orbit of Nycos Aristedes, a planet 7.8 light-years from Xandar and quickly loses power. As the ship begins to fall out of orbit they are saved by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\" href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" slug=\"quasar\">Quasar</a>, the Protector of the Universe, who is an old friend of Nova’s.</p><p>They quickly find that Quasar is overseeing a mass-evacuation before the Wave can reach the planet. Quasar manages to talk Nova into assisting despite the objections of the Worldmind and Drax. Nova attempts to open another stargate for the colonists to escape though, but Annihilus sensing the power of the stargate attacks. Nova and Quasar defend the colonists and take the fight to the capital ships of the Annihilation Wave itself. Seeking to stop Annihilus before this invasion gets any worse they attempt to kill Annihilus, but he is ready for them.</p><p>During the brief struggle Quasar is slain and his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-42361\" href=\"/quantum-bands/4055-42361/\" slug=\"quantum-bands\">Quantum Bands</a> are claimed by Annihilus, making him even more powerful. In a desperate gambit, as Annihilus attempts to drain the Nova Force as he had Quasar’s Quantum-power, the Worldmind interfaces with the Wave’s hive-mind, causing the fleet to attack itself. Nova barely escapes with his life and is retrieved by Drax and Cammi and is quickly treated for his wounds. Annihilus tasting defeat for the first time orders a retreat.</p><p><b>A.D. 12</b></p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-4818\" href=\"/ronan/4005-4818/\" slug=\"ronan\">Ronan</a> the Accuser of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\" href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" slug=\"kree\">Kree</a> is taken into military custody to face court martial for crimes against the Empire.</p><p><b>A.D. 15</b></p><p>While performing espionage against the Kree, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21332\" href=\"/super-skrull/4005-21332/\" slug=\"super-skrull\">Super-Skrull</a> learns of the Annihilation Wave’s destruction of several <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13341\" href=\"/skrull/4005-13341/\" slug=\"skrull\">Skrull</a> worlds and its weapon, the Harvester of Sorrows.</p><p><b>A.D. 17</b></p><p>Annihilus orders his forces to bring him the heralds of Galactus alive in the hopes of analyzing and mastering the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41039\" href=\"/power-cosmic/4015-41039/\" slug=\"power-cosmic\">Power Cosmic</a>.

During this time Surfer is attacked by more Seekers but despite having them outmatched watches as they are cut down by his fellow former heralds <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7108\" href=\"/firelord/4005-7108/\" slug=\"firelord\">Firelord</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40878\" href=\"/red-shift/4005-40878/\" slug=\"red-shift\">Red Shift</a>.

Surfer agrees and Galactus readies the Surfer for the coming conflict with more power just as Ravenous and the Seekers arrive with the advanced scouts of the Annihilation Wave, having tracked the Surfer there, and demands that Galactus surrender to them. Galactus simply unleashes the Silver Surfer upon them and watches with mute interest as he devastates the fleet and elegantly defeats Ravenous, asking that they retreat back to the Negative Zone.

At first Annihilus brutally overpowers Nova, but the Quantum bands choose Phyla to be their new bearer, turning the tide.

This willed him to recreate his city, and a fountain of energy flowed from his ring, creating every detail of Coast City from Hal's mind.

Meanwhile, Spider-Man, Daredevil and the Avengers are put through their paces as they attempt to defend New York from the growing demonic legions.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>When the young mutant hero <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\" href=\"/magik/4005-8303/\" slug=\"magik\">Magik</a> became ruler of the dimension of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\" href=\"/limbo/4020-42990/\" slug=\"limbo\">Limbo</a>, one of its demon-sorcerers, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42869\" href=\"/nastirh/4005-42869/\" slug=\"nastirh\">N'astirh</a>, began to covet the idea of not only controlling Limbo, but of become master of Earth as well.</p><p>He gathered demonic agents in defiance of Limbo’s new ruler, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10291\" href=\"/sym/4005-10291/\" slug=\"sym\">S’ym</a>, and finally launched his grand scheme. N'astirh orchestrated a kidnapping of 13 babies of Earth in hopes to sacrifice them in a ritual known as Inferno, which would have given him control over both dimensions. Previously, N'astirh had also contacted the woman known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10981\" href=\"/madelyne-pryor/4005-10981/\" slug=\"madelyne-pryor\">Madelyne Pryor</a>, sensing her power as a clone of Phoenix (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a>) and helped her release her power in what would eventually make her the Goblin Queen.</p><p>First, N’astirh opened a gateway between Earth and Limbo through which his demon horde could travel, using the 13 children's souls as energy for the pentagram-shaped nexus. Inferno had begun, and New York began to feel its effects. The weather turned hot, unearthly hot, and people began to succumb to their more evil desires. Even inanimate objects began to be effected, coming to life and acting in malicious, evil ways.</p><p>N’astirh was ultimately defeated by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\" href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" slug=\"new-mutants\">New Mutants</a> and Magik, who rejected her dark heritage and reverted to her innocent six-year old self. They were also helped by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40418\" href=\"/x-terminators/4060-40418/\" slug=\"x-terminators\">X-Terminators</a>, a team of mutant teenagers.</p><p>During the event, Madelyne Pryor, as the Goblin Queen, had taken the opportunity to confront the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" slug=\"x-men\">X-Men</a> and the original <a data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\" href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" slug=\"x-factor\">X-Factor</a>, and she even managed to make N’astirh her servant, for a time.

During their hunt, they encounter Spider-Man's <a href=\"/doppelganger/4005-15274/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15274\"> doppleganger</a> and they take him in as their \"pet\". When Peter learns of Carnage's escape, he breaks his promise and dons his costume to fight this menace.</p><p>He is eventually confronted by Carnage and his team-mates and is easily knocked out.

They are then attacked by Doppleganger and Shriek before Carnage himself joins the fight and lays waste to the heroes before they could escape. Elsewhere, Venom discovers of Carnage's return and decides to return to New York and attempts to fight them on his own but he is defeated. While Spidey was searching for Carnage, he discovers <a href=\"/demogoblin/4005-15272/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15272\"> Demogoblin</a> in a park and fights him, but the villain manages to escape.

They attack the villains but they are again defeated. Venom then recruits Morbius into their team and they fight Carnage's team again at a night club but the fight ends with the villains' escape and Spidey's team helping the civilians. After that, they obtain a Sonic gun from Reed Richards and recruit <a href=\"/firestar/4005-2101/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\">Firestar</a>. They lead Carnage to his old foster home and ambush him with Firestar and the Sonic Gun, giving Venom an opportunity to kill Cassady but is stopped by Spider-Man.

Venom is kidnapped and tortured by Carnage while Spidey and his team-mates rendezvous at Avengers Mansion where they recruited <a href=\"/deathlok/4005-7258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7258\">Deathlok</a> and <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist.</a></p><p>Soon <a href=\"/nightwatch/4005-7505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7505\">Nightwatch</a> joins the team and they follow the villains to the Statue of Liberty where Venom is being held. Venom was able to escape and he joins the heroes in their final clash against the villains. Iron Fist and Dagger combine their powers through Deathlok to channel an energy that calms and weakens the villains, giving the heroes the chance to gain the upper hand and defeat their foes except for Carnage who was able to escape. Venom and Spider-Man confront Carnage at a Cemetery where they fight and Carnage is defeated in an explosion. Venom makes his escape and Carnage is placed in a stasis chamber while the rest of his \"family\" are taken to prison. Black Cat is fearful of Carnage's return but Peter tells her after looking at the Osborns' graves that \"not all monsters return\".</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/maximum-carnage/4050-27313/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27313\"> Maximum Carnage</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-maximum-carnage/4050-38267/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38267\">Spider-Man: Maximum Carnage</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/blockbusters-of-the-marvel-universe/4050-38679/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38679\">Blockbusters of the Marvel Universe</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot</h2><p>Sometime in the not-so-distant future, Superheroes have lost sight of their true goal, their true calling. Most of the Super Villains are dead or taken care of, and the Heroes now battle each other over turf, bragging rights or whatever. Most of the Metahumans are descendants of former heroes, such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40842\" href=\"/nightstar/4005-40842/\" slug=\"nightstar\">Nightstar</a>, daughter of Dick Grayson <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\" href=\"/nightwing/4005-1691/\" slug=\"nightwing\">(Nightwing)</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2389\" href=\"/starfire/4005-2389/\" slug=\"starfire\">Starfire</a>’s daughter and Lightning, daughter of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10994\" href=\"/black-lightning/4005-10994/\" slug=\"black-lightning\">Black Lightning</a>.

Norman was chosen by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2361\" href=\"/spectre/4005-2361/\" slug=\"spectre\">Spectre</a> to choose the fate of the guilty during Armageddon. Norman was chosen because of his relationship with the now deceased <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9299\" href=\"/wesley-dodds/4005-9299/\" slug=\"wesley-dodds\">Wesley Dodds</a>, the Sandman. McKay was the pastor in the hospital room when the Sandman died, and the Sandman passed his visions to McKay.</p><h2>Superman’s Retirement</h2><p>Superman, the greatest hero of Earth’s History, had been defending his adoptive planet for many years.

Superman manages to protect Earth daily. Until the day <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\" href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" slug=\"joker\">Joker</a> came to town. The Joker killed 93 people at the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42195\" href=\"/daily-planet/4060-42195/\" slug=\"daily-planet\">Daily Planet</a>, including Lois Lane. The slowly aging Superman searched everywhere for the Joker but the Joker was apprehended by the authorities. While in their custody, the Joker was killed in cold-blood by an up and comer Superhero named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41481\" href=\"/magog/4005-41481/\" slug=\"magog\">Magog</a>. Infuriated, Superman took Magog to jail. Magog stood trial for the murder of the Joker but was acquitted. When this happened, Superman decides humanity and time had tossed him away, and retires.</p><h2>Kansas</h2><p>After Superman’s retirement, many of his contemporaries followed his lead. This allowed the new generation of win at all costs Superheroes to take the lead in “crime fighting” and “world saving”. In fact, while Magog’s team of Superheroes were chasing down a “villain”, an accident occurs in which all of Kansas is destroyed. This is the queue for Superman’s return after ten long years. Superman reforms the Justice League with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" slug=\"wonder-woman\">Wonder Woman</a>, Red Robin (Dick Grayson), Green Lantern (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\" href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" slug=\"hal-jordan\">Alan Scott</a>), <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3404\" href=\"/red-arrow/4005-3404/\" slug=\"red-arrow\">Red Arrow</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8337\" href=\"/hawkman/4005-8337/\" slug=\"hawkman\">Hawkman</a> and others.

He turned to the mutant-enhancing drug <a href=\"/kick/4015-42307/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42307\"> Kick</a> before it was known that Kick was actually the aerosol form of the <a href=\"/sublime/4005-11330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11330\"> Sublime</a> bacteria. Sublime took over Beast's body, and used it to continue his quest for mutant extermination. The Sublime Beast would experiment on himself, turning white and slowing down the aging process. With access to genetic samples of all the X-Men he created a hybrid race from mutant DNA that were called the crawlers. The crawlers were based on <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\"> Nightcrawler</a>'s DNA, giving them a similar appearance and his power of teleportation. He continued to develop them, adding in the genetic traits of other mutants and giving the ability to duplicate themselves (from the <a href=\"/madrox/4005-7910/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7910\"> Madrox</a>), eye-beams (presumably from Cyclops's power), wings, and more. He developed a laboratory that worked as a factory for generating crawlers, and doing other experiments. At some point he gained control of <a href=\"/fantomex/4005-4281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4281\"> Fantomex</a>, grafting new parts onto him and turning him into the last of his <a href=\"/u-men/4060-47994/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47994\"> U-Men</a>. Now called Apollyon the Destroyer, Fantomex became the Beast's herald, carrying out his bidding.</p><p>Around 150 years from Jean's death a <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\"> Phoenix Force</a> egg was found dormant on the moon. This was brought to the Earth. The mutants that discovered the Egg did not have it for long as Apollyon was sent to retrieve it for his master. If Beast were to gain control of the egg he would have control over the Phoenix would be virtually unstoppable. The egg was entrusted into the care of <a href=\"/tom-skylark/4005-41731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41731\"> Tom Skylark</a>. Tom's longtime companion <a href=\"/rover/4005-41732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41732\"> Rover</a>, one of the last of the original Sentinels, was used to transport the egg. Tom and Rover escaped with the egg as his teammates were being slain by Apollyon and the crawlers. Tom sought out the X-Men to help protect the egg. After he had Rover destroy a pack of crawlers that were following them Tom located <a href=\"/eva/4005-45709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45709\"> E.V.A</a>. E.V.A. was Apollyon's sentinel external nervous system when he was still Fantomex. She took them back to the X-Men's base not knowing that one of the crawlers had hitched a ride inside of Rover.</p><p>Back at the X-Men's base the crawler teleported out and began to duplicate himself. E.V.A. called upon the X-Men to help protect the egg. <a href=\"/tito/4005-41733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41733\"> Tito</a> arrived to help beat off the intruders, but several swarmed over Rover and were able to teleport the egg back to the Beast's lair. The surviving three <a href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\"> Stepford Cuckoos</a>, now simply going by the three-in-one told <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\"> Wolverine</a> and <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/4005-11317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11317\"> Cassandra Nova</a> (now going by Cassandra Nova Xavier) about their dreams of the start of a new dark age. Now possessing the Phoenix egg the Beast would try to live out his dreams of stopping evolution. He could potentially encode the traits of the Phoenix into his armies or even in himself. Tom got Rover back, disinfected and safe. Rover looked even more torn up than before.</p><p>Back at the Beast's layer Apollyon begged him for grafts from the phoenix. Beast called upon his crawlers to use their power to incubate the phoenix egg, causing it to hatch prematurely. Jean Grey came out of the egg, drawn back from the <a href=\"/white-hot-room/4020-50483/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50483\"> White Hot Room</a> early and because of this was confused. Beast greeted her, unknowing that her old friend was now taken over by the Sublime entity. Beast sent her out to kill the Termids, a race of insects, where she found Bumbleboy the X-Men's ambassador to the Termid multitude. She killed him but before sending his consciousness to the White Hot Room she kept his essence in his skull to learn about the X-Men.</p><p>Meanwhile Beast had grafted the traits of a mind parasite onto one of his crawlers and sent it to destroy the X-Men. The crawler burst both of its lungs to teleport into the school through the X-Men's shields. The X-Men fought it, not realizing that the mind-parisite was taking hold of them. The out of control X-Men came after the Stepford Cukoos who were held up with Cerebra. Not wishing to be eaten by the Mind Parasite that had taken hold of the others, the Cuckoos turned on an auto-destruct sequence for their consciousness, and slapped each other a high-five as the former X-Men broke into the building.</p><p>Deep in the ocean <a href=\"/mer-max/4005-50510/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50510\"> Mer-Max</a> was being attacked by a ship full of Crawlers. <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/4005-11317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11317\"> Cassandra Nova</a> and <a href=\"/martha-johansson/4005-41121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41121\"> Martha Johansson</a> arrived in their jet just in time, sending the Crawlers into fits of pain with intense telepathic noise. <a href=\"/rover/4005-41732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41732\"> Rover</a>, <a href=\"/tom-skylark/4005-41731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41731\"> Tom Skylark</a>, <a href=\"/tito-bohusk-jr/4005-41733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41733\"> Beak</a>, and <a href=\"/eva/4005-45709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45709\"> E.V.A</a> followed right behind. Tom was about to tell E.V.A. something in case they didn't make it, but before he got the chance the Crawlers began to teleport around Rover, and attacked him until he plunged into the ocean depths. Tom cried out for his partner to no avail, and the ocean liner they were on was now sinking.</p><p>When Phoenix arrived back she asked Submlime about the X-Men. He told her that they were enemies that needed to be destroyed. He explained to her that they just continue to become more powerful, resisting his influence and dominating the planet. He wishes to finally exterminate them. Sublime sent Phoenix after the remaining X-Men, and he remained at his hide-out. Sublime told the agonized Apollyon about his life which began eons ago. He described how as a bacterial life form he arose from the Earth to become the dominant life-form. Even the rise of humanity could not sway him, and he continued to infect and spread as he pleased. The rise of mutants created generations of homo-superior that were growing more and more immune, some capable of power on a cosmic scale. These mutants challanged his position as the dominant life form on Earth, and for the first time he felt the fear of extinction. In almost unbearable anguish Apollyon demanded Sublime give him the power of the Phoenix, grafts that would finally make him feel whole. As Sublime finished his story he climbed into a chamber which would give him a portion of the Phoenix power, not Apollyon.</p><p>Back in the ocean Phoenix had found Wolverine. Phoenix told him how the mutants time was over and that she would be their destroyer. Wolverine tried to talk Jean out of it, trying to force her to remember her life before. Cassandra and Martha flew in. Cassandra had read the <a href=\"/shiar/4015-43138/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43138\"> Shi'ar</a> files on the Phoenix, and discovered how to telepathically unplug that power from its host. Wolverine caught Jean and she seemed to be remembering her old life. Wolverine described how after her death Cyclops simply gave up, and that Beast eventually became infected by Sublime due to the pressures of trying to run the school. Sublime arrived with his new power and blew up Cassandra and Martha's ship. Beak was the first to attack and was fried by Sublime. Tom summoned what he could of his power to call Rover back to help. Sublime fought off both Rover and E.V.A., causing E.V.A.'s software to go haywire. After watching Beak die Wolverine lunged at Sublime, but it was no use. Sublime turned off Wolverine's healing factor and cast him aside. As he fell Martha assured him that they were all going to the <a href=\"/white-hot-room/4020-50483/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50483\"> White Hot Room</a>.</p><p>As Sublime believed his victory was guaranteed Phoenix informed him that he had lost. She extracted the Sublime bacteria from Beast's body. Beast was back, but not for long. Appolyon had arrived and removed Beast's head. Wolverine was finally at peace and Tom rushed to aid the dying E.V.A.</p><p>Phoenix went back to the White Hot Room where she sanitizes that timeline by cutting it off where it went bad. Hundreds of other Phoenix hosts were there with her and helped her including <a href=\"/kid-omega/4005-40583/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40583\"> Kid Omega</a>, the Green Phoenix. Here Jean was dressed in a white and gold Phoenix outfit as the White Phoenix of the Crown. She healed the broken time-line, urging Cyclops to live. Back in the present, when Scott had made the decision to abandon the X-Men (thereby causing this timeline to occur) Scott was again presented with the decision to leave or stay by Emma Frost. Standing over Jean's grave Scott decided this time that he wanted to go on, fixing the time-line permanently.</p><p> </p><h2>Related Story-Arcs</h2><p><a href=\"/planet-x/4045-50498/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-50498\"> Planet X</a> - Jean's death at the hands of <a href=\"/xorn/4005-3183/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3183\"> Xorn</a> created the alternate time-line where Here Comes Tomorrow takes place.</p><p> </p><h2>Additional Information</h2><p>This reality is designated Earth-15104. </p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-here-comes-tomorrow/4050-30258/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30258\">New X-Men: Here Comes Tomorrow</a></li><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-ultimate-collection-book-3/4000-186307/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-186307\">New X-Men Ultimate Collection Vol. 3</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-109/4000-292442/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292442\">New X-Men #109</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-110/4000-292443/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292443\">New X-Men #110</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-111/4000-292444/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292444\">New X-Men #111</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

The Freedom Force was led by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\" href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\">                                   Mystique</a>, and were a government supported team of ex-villains.

The vision show that everyone inside of a particular Skyscraper in Dallas will soon be dead.  <br />Then when the weather changes to snowy in the middle of July in Dallas, as well as prehistoric creatures and other monsters begin to randomly appear, both teams realize that something of grave importance is going on. They put aside there differences for the time being and co-operate as one team to try and restore the balance.  <br /> <br />Elsewhere Storm and Forge are in a new world where time moves at an accelerated rate. while only mere minutes pass in real time, Storm and Forge spend a year in this altered time. allowing Forge the time he needs to build a device that restores Storms powers. Forge and Storm combine their Magic and Lighting respectively to open a portal back to the real world and to Dallas. <br /> <br />Back in the city with the X-Men, the X-Team learns of something Forge did in the Vietnam War that created a being known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-26995\" href=\"/adversary/4005-26995/\">                                Adversary</a> whom is behind the madness and utter chaos surronding them. <br /> <br /> Storm, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\">                             Wolverine</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\" href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\">                            Colossus</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\" href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\">                           Rogue</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6757\" href=\"/longshot/4005-6757/\">                          Longshot</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\" href=\"/dazzler/4005-1498/\">                         Dazzler</a>,<a data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\" href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\">                         Psylocke</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\" href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\">                       Havok</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10981\" href=\"/madelyne-pryor/4005-10981/\">                      Madelyne Pryor</a> all end up having to sacrifice their lives just as destiny had forseen.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>A disguised <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> gathers a group of supervillains he calls the Prime Movers to join forces and destroy the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>---whom Loki had actually inadvertently created back in the day---and to strike out at his arch-rival <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>. <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr Doom</a>, <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a>, <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>, <a href=\"/the-mandarin/4005-3530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3530\">Mandarin</a>, <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> and <a href=\"/wizard/4005-3287/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3287\">the Wizard</a> agree, while <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse</a> (in the pages of <a href=\"/x-factor/4050-3657/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3657\">X-Factor</a> #50), <a href=\"/cobra/4005-11895/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11895\">Cobra</a>, <a href=\"/mad-thinker/4005-2131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2131\">Mad Thinker</a> and <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> decline the offer. As part of his plan, Loki engineers a prison break at <a href=\"/the-vault/4020-43582/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43582\">the Vault</a>. The main thrust of the issues involved in this line-wide event is that heroes face off against unfamiliar enemies, for example, Mandarin appears in the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> issues, and <a href=\"/rusty/4005-46343/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46343\">Rusty</a> and <a href=\"/skids/4005-3194/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3194\">Skids</a> of the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants</a> battle the <a href=\"/vulture/4005-4459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4459\">Vulture</a>.</p><p>The assembled villains fail to operate in a cohesive way, thwarting their plans to kill their enemies. Loki ends up imprisoning the Kingpin, Mandarin and Wizard in frustration, when the Wizard accidentally reveals the location of their secret meeting place on the <a href=\"/isle-of-silence/4020-56135/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56135\">Isle of Silence</a>. The Avengers track Loki down and Thor banishes him back to Asgard. Doctor Doom backs out of the arrangement and pursues his own scheme to defeat the Fantastic Four, as his own self-importance means he can't allow anyone else to defeat them. While the Fantastic Four are called to Congress to testify on the proposed Superhuman Registration Act, he sends a random assortment of villains to attack them.</p><p>Although this event was huge in its scope, covering almost every title in Marvel's line-up at the time, it had few lasting consequences. The most significant outcomes perhaps were the transformation of <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a> into an Asian ninja assassin, and the first appearance of the <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warriors</a> team in comics (in the pages of <a href=\"/thor/4050-2294/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2294\">Thor</a>).

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\" href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" slug=\"gotham-city\">Gotham City</a> had suffered the results of a magnitude 7.6 earthquake in the earlier \"<a data-ref-id=\"4045-42229\" href=\"/batman-cataclysm/4045-42229/\" slug=\"batman-cataclysm\">Cataclysm</a>\" storyline. Previous disasters, such as two separate plague outbreaks, caused many to want to write off Gotham completely. The U.S. Government gave a timeline. At the end, all bridges were destroyed and all known paths out of the island city were covered by the National Guard. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">Justice League of America</a> were forbidden by law from entering the city. They kept busy defeating outside threats to the city, along with other crises. The situation inside was left to Batman and his allies; <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a> offered his help in the city, but after staying for one day realized this was not the type of problem he could fix with just power. Upon the realization, he leaves Gotham in the hands of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" slug=\"batman\">Batman</a>, (although Superman, in the guise of Clark Kent, would appear again months later to check on Batman's progress).</p><p>The city was swiftly carved up by gangs and various <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55720\" href=\"/batman-villains/4015-55720/\" slug=\"batman-villains\">supervillains</a> Batman had battled over the years. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\" href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" slug=\"james-gordon\">Jim Gordon</a> and several well known <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42090\" href=\"/gotham-city-police-department/4060-42090/\" slug=\"gotham-city-police-department\">Gotham officers</a> chose to stay behind and an unknown number of policemen willingly followed suit, all in an effort to protect the innocent people. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\" href=\"/oracle/4005-5368/\" slug=\"oracle\">Oracle</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1690\" href=\"/huntress/4005-1690/\" slug=\"huntress\">Huntress</a> also ended up on the inside.</p><p>Huntress adopted the Batgirl persona in Batman's absence, realizing that Gotham needed 'Bat-Personnel' to keep the situation under control. As Bruce Wayne, Batman had left the city to try to solve the problem politically, using his name and money to convince the federal government to delay closing off Gotham. Unfortunately, his efforts failed, arguably because he appeared to the government as Bruce Wayne an air-headed billionaire with little concern for serious issues of which the No Man's Land was exemplary.</p><p>Some 100 days after the Federal Declaration of the No Man's Land, he returned to Gotham to reclaim the Batman title and his people, many of whom had long since given up on him. Even his former ally, Jim Gordon, believed that Batman had abandoned Gotham to the villains.</p><p>What Batman returned to was a state of unrest and disorder on a grand scale. Since there was no longer anywhere to spend it, money became worthless; people would barter anything from batteries to services to protection for daily necessities. It seemed the only person to have any use for cash was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4885\" href=\"/penguin/4005-4885/\" slug=\"penguin\">The Penguin</a>, who had nightly events where those few with cash left spent it all on such rare and simple items as an apple. The Penguin, despite his riches and implicit opportunities to flee the city, instead opted to stay. He had his own mysterious link to the outside and apparently enjoyed taking advantage of the dire situation in Gotham.</p><p>With Batman being gone for so long, and his very existence debatable in the Gotham underworld, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1690\" href=\"/huntress/4005-1690/\" slug=\"huntress\">Huntress</a> was able to pass off as not <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1701\" href=\"/batgirl/4005-1701/\" slug=\"batgirl\">Batgirl</a>, but Batman himself to many of the criminals she faced. Following the example of the gangs in town, she even tagged by graffiti her territory with the bat symbol. She went back to her Huntress costume when the Dark Knight confronted her after her failure to hold territory against <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\" href=\"/two-face/4005-5555/\" slug=\"two-face\">Two-Face</a>'s forces, without any pleasantries. The third Batgirl, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-65230\" href=\"/cassandra-cain/4005-65230/\" slug=\"cassandra-cain\">Cassandra Cain</a>, estranged daughter of assassin <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10482\" href=\"/david-cain/4005-10482/\" slug=\"david-cain\">David Cain</a>, made important contributions to the effort during this time, as well as starting a lasting friendship with the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\" href=\"/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/\" slug=\"barbara-gordon\">Oracle</a>.</p><p>In an effort to redeem herself, the Huntress went to the aid of a church that was open as a hospital and sanctuary to anyone desiring it in Gotham. Having no protection because of their benevolent intentions, the church and its kind staff were sitting ducks. The Huntress' desires to use her expertise to protect them was seen more as an unnecessary and warlike show of force than as help, even when she was trying to halt the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3726\" href=\"/scarecrow/4005-3726/\" slug=\"scarecrow\">Scarecrow</a>'s machinations to sabotage the church's efforts.</p><p>The weaker gang-leaders fell first, mostly to Batman and or James Gordon's officers. Street by street battles were fought, with deaths on both sides. Eventually Gordon's forces split, with half the squad following the more violent Petit, who believed that the only solution was to meet violence with more violence rather than Gordon's more peaceful methods. Two-Face became a major warlord, acquiring and losing territory every so often, and caused major problems for the police. He kidnapped Jim Gordon, killing two of his guards, in revenge for breaking a previous alliance, although in the subsequent trial Gordon was acquitted by the defence of Harvey Dent, Dent concluding that since Gordon had been essentially blackmailed into the alliance the agreement was void. The Penguin, as previously mentioned, remained in the city and was approached by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4683\" href=\"/mercy-graves/4005-4683/\" slug=\"mercy-graves\">Mercy Graves</a>, acting on behalf of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\" href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" slug=\"lex-luthor\">Lex Luthor</a>, to begin a rudimentary clean-up of the downtown districts for Luthor's eventual move-in. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1697\" href=\"/poison-ivy/4005-1697/\" slug=\"poison-ivy\">Poison Ivy</a> took over Robinson Park. She ended up caring for numerous orphans and was left alone by Batman in return for providing food. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25091\" href=\"/mr-zsasz/4005-25091/\" slug=\"mr-zsasz\">Zsasz</a> owned his own territory, as did <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3715\" href=\"/mr-freeze/4005-3715/\" slug=\"mr-freeze\">Mr. Freeze</a>.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-6129\" href=\"/bane/4005-6129/\" slug=\"bane\">Bane</a> was also involved indirectly as a strong man for Lex Luthor; he notably destroyed the Hall of Records to fulfill one of Luthor's goals. He also drastically reduced Two-Face's territory in the process, making him insignificant. Despite his status as a supervillain, the Scarecrow was welcomed into a church filled with refugees and manipulated various factions in a plot to send the church's refugees spiraling into fear and despair. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\" href=\"/riddler/4005-3718/\" slug=\"riddler\">Riddler</a>, strangest of all perhaps, actually fled Gotham and spent the year barely noticed. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\" href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" slug=\"joker\">Joker</a> made the most of his rare appearances. He spent some time as the ruler of an apartment building filled with supplies. This ended up, naturally, with lots of dead people, many from his own gang. He later re-formed and attacked <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11379\" href=\"/detective-pettit/4005-11379/\" slug=\"detective-pettit\">Petit</a>'s territory. During the attack, he captured several of Petit's men, dressed them up to look like him, and forced them to walk in front of Petit; the now-insane cop shot all of them without even confirming whether or not they were the real Joker. When Petit killed an officer who tried to desert, Huntress knocked him out, subsequently facing the Joker and around twenty of his men all by herself, suffering near-fatal wounds in the process before Batman and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\" href=\"/nightwing/4005-1691/\" slug=\"nightwing\">Nightwing</a> showed up to help her.</p><p>When Lex Luthor's money illegally brought in an army of construction workers, the Joker tried to kill his share. Bane, employed by Luthor now, appeared again, protecting the innocent workers from death, maiming and worse.</p><p>Near the end of the saga, as a statement to murder hope with the news that the No Man's Land was intended to end on New Year's Day, the Joker decided to kill all the children born during the \"No Man's Land\" storyline. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17577\" href=\"/sarah-essen/4005-17577/\" slug=\"sarah-essen\">Sarah Essen</a>, Commissioner Gordon's wife, ended up confronting the Joker alone in Gordon's police headquarters. While saving a baby from a dangerous drop to a hard floor, she was shot and killed. Gordon restrained himself from killing the Joker, opting only to shoot out his knee. The Joker, quite naturally, found this unspeakably funny, since it had been he who crippled Barbara Gordon.</p><p>Eventually, thanks in no small part to the financial and political machinations of Lex Luthor dipping his hands, as ever, in both legitimate and illegal means to achieve his goals Gotham City was released and rebuilt, and rejoined the United States. Gordon and the surviving officers were reinstated as full policemen.</p><p>Much of the story line was narrated by Oracle, as she used her resources to become a low-tech version of herself. She used paper to document events and the passage of time, operatives and emergency phones (knowing which ones were still in operation) to gather intel, and maps colored by pencils to keep track of who controlled which portions of the city at a particular time. Her maps were frequently shown in the comics to help the reader follow the progression of territorial disputes (Gotham City maps in current series are based in large part on Oracle's maps from this series). Oracle remained one of the few people in the city with the ability to contact the outside world. In his own series, <a data-ref-id=\"4050-5750\" href=\"/hitman/4050-5750/\" slug=\"hitman\">Hitman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12123\" href=\"/hitman/4005-12123/\" slug=\"hitman\">Tommy Monaghan</a> had found his own ways in and out of Gotham (he spent No Man's Land protecting his own few blocks of where he had grown up, putting out the skulls of vampires as warning signs).</p><p>Like Oracle, all of the characters got serious testing of their mettle. Commissioner Gordon became more of a general leading an army than a police officer and held a grudge against Batman, even after he had returned. It wasn't until nearly the end of the story line before they talked again, and Batman even revealed to Gordon his secret identity, in a gesture to regain his trust, but Gordon turned away without looking. He didn't want to know who was under the mask, and told Batman to put it back on.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19706\" href=\"/batman-no-mans-land/4050-19706/\" slug=\"batman-no-mans-land\">Batman: No Man's Land</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-44947\" href=\"/batman-no-mans-land/4050-44947/\" slug=\"batman-no-mans-land\">Batman: No Man's Land</a> (New Edition)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-33987\" href=\"/nightwing-a-darker-shade-of-justice/4050-33987/\" slug=\"nightwing-a-darker-shade-of-justice\">Nightwing: A Darker Shade of Justice</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><span><a data-ref-id=\"4000-369200\" href=\"/batman-vigilantes-de-gotham-/4000-369200/\" slug=\"batman-vigilantes-de-gotham-\">Batman: Vigilantes de Gotham #43</a></span></li><li><span><a data-ref-id=\"4000-369199\" href=\"/batman-vigilantes-de-gotham-/4000-369199/\" slug=\"batman-vigilantes-de-gotham-\">Batman: Vigilantes de Gotham #44</a></span></li><li><span><a data-ref-id=\"4000-369198\" href=\"/batman-vigilantes-de-gotham-/4000-369198/\" slug=\"batman-vigilantes-de-gotham-\">Batman: Vigilantes de Gotham #45</a></span></li></ul><h2>Novelization</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2132334-no_man_s_land.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2132334\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2132334-no_man_s_land.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2132334\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2132334-no_man_s_land.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2132334-no_man_s_land.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></a></figure></td><td><blockquote><i>GOTHAM CITY: a dark, twisted reÞection of urban America. Overcrowded, overbuilt, and overshadowed by a continuous air of menace, this gothic nightmare is a breeding ground for the depraved, the indifferent, and the criminally insane.

Witness to the brutal murder of his parents, Bruce Wayne has dedicated his life to protecting this city, taking a form to inspire hope in the innocent...and fear in the guilty. He is the masked vigilante known as the Batman.</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>Now the battlefield has changed. Leveled by a massive earthquake that left thousands dead and millions more wounded, Gotham City has been transformed into a lawless wilderness -- a No Man's Land -- where the survivors are turning against one another, and where the city's protectors are torn by a crisis that may consume them all.</i></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>Written By: Greg Ruka</li><li>Publisher: Pocket Star (March, 2001)</li><li>ISBN-10: 0671774557</li><li>ISBN-13: 978-0671774554</li></ul></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>",

    "description": "<p>The three chapters are to be taken as happening concurrently.</p><h3>Generation Next (Chapter One)</h3><p>To some humans, mutants are simply a scary step on the evolutionary ladder. Humans are unable to top this next phase naturally. Not content with this state of affairs, both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14861\" href=\"/steven-lang/4005-14861/\" slug=\"steven-lang\">Stephen Lang</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13379\" href=\"/cameron-hodge/4005-13379/\" slug=\"cameron-hodge\">Cameron Hodge</a> allow themselves to be assimilated into the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9651\" href=\"/phalanx/4005-9651/\" slug=\"phalanx\">Phalanx</a>. This act, they hope, will ensure that humans have a leg-up on the evolutionary ladder. One problem stands in the way of mutant domination: mutants cannot be assimilated into the Phalanx. For this reason, the Phalanx goes after the next generation of mutants, so as to find some way to cure the mutant immunity.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-9708\" href=\"/banshee/4005-9708/\" slug=\"banshee\">Banshee</a> visits the X-Mansion and notices that the X-Men are acting odd. Running a computer scan, he learns that the only mutants in the mansion are himself, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" slug=\"emma-frost\">Emma Frost</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4562\" href=\"/jubilee/4005-4562/\" slug=\"jubilee\">Jubilee</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\" href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" slug=\"sabretooth\">Sabretooth</a>. The four manage to get free and learn of the Phalanx objective of finding the newer mutants. They are able to save one, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10576\" href=\"/synch/4005-10576/\" slug=\"synch\">Synch</a>, before heading to California (a lead they got from following <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3426\" href=\"/husk/4005-3426/\" slug=\"husk\">Husk</a>'s psy-trail from when she got captured). There, Emma and Banshee break into a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" slug=\"shield\">SHIELD</a> base and trace the Phalanx signature to a boat in San Diego.</p><p>The Phalanx is successful in capturing Husk, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40460\" href=\"/m/4005-40460/\" slug=\"m\">Monet</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12548\" href=\"/blink/4005-12548/\" slug=\"blink\">Blink</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10566\" href=\"/skin/4005-10566/\" slug=\"skin\">Skin</a>. In their cell, they band together and find a way out of their cell, only to come face-to-face with the Phalanx. Fortunately, Banshee and company arrive to save the younger mutants, but it is only Blink who can actually save the day. She teleports the Phalanx away, leaving her new friends safe.</p><h3>Life Signs (Chapter Two)</h3><p>At Mont St. Francis, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" slug=\"professor-x\">Professor Xavier</a> has assembled the collective teams of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-14864\" href=\"/excalibur/4060-14864/\" slug=\"excalibur\">Excalibur</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\" href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" slug=\"x-factor\">X-Factor</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\" href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" slug=\"x-force\">X-Force</a>. He alerts the teams of the Phalanx threat, having started when the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40563\" href=\"/friends-of-humanity/4060-40563/\" slug=\"friends-of-humanity\">Friends of Humanity</a> got a hold of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7223\" href=\"/warlock/4005-7223/\" slug=\"warlock\">Warlock</a>'s remains. They initially wanted to use the remains as a way to change humans into a way to be the next breed of Sentinels, but the hosts became a part of the collective and the Phalanx evolved faster than the humans had intended. Instead of finding a way to eliminate the mutant threat, the Phalanx grew to trying to eradicate life on Earth.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\" href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" slug=\"wolfsbane\">Wolfsbane</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\" href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" slug=\"cannonball\">Cannonball</a> hear of the incarceration of Douglock and go to inspect him to see if he is a reanimated <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\" href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" slug=\"cypher\">Doug Ramsey</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\" href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" slug=\"forge\">Forge</a> joins them and sees the wonder of a new life form, as Douglock is a being that has broken off the Phalanx collective. Douglock then kidnaps the three visitors and takes them to Italy where the Phalanx has built a spire to communicate to the originators of the Phalanx. Douglock, Cannonball, and Wolfsbane travel to the top of the tower in hopes of jamming the signal to the stars.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Phalanx leader has turned Forge's mutant power against himself. Forge is shown the glory of bringing on a new race and he is unable to stop himself from caring for the incubators of the Phalanx. The incubators hold the next generation of Phalanx, a fail-safe in case the transmission isn't able to get through to the Phalanx originators. Fortunately, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\" href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" slug=\"nightcrawler\">Nightcrawler</a> is able to talk Forge into rebooting how Forge's mutant power operates and Forge is able to destroy the incubators. At this point, Douglock supposedly sacrifices himself by throwing himself onto the beam to space. The Phalanx is undone and breaks down. Douglock survives, however, since he has things left to live for.</p><h3>Final Sanction (Chapter Three)</h3><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a> return from their honeymoon to find the X-Men have been kidnapped. They head to Muir Island to meet up with the Professor and find out how they can help; instead they find the island overrun with Phalanx. The Professor, however, had sent a message to both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\" href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" slug=\"cable\">Cable</a> before leaving the island and the two meet up with Cyclops and Jean Grey in time to prevent the Phalanx from getting their hands on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\" href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" slug=\"moira-mactaggert\">Moira MacTaggert</a>'s research. The research is needed so that the Phalanx can learn how to assimilate mutants into their collective. To stop the Phalanx, Cable and Jean stage a psionic assault on the Astral Plane while Cyclops and Wolverine sneak in and take the information. The mutants learn that the Phalanx collective is located in Tibet, blow up Moira's laboratory, and head to finally eradicate the Phalanx threat.</p><p>In Tibet, Stephen Lang has realized that the Phalanx has gotten out of hand. He wants mutants eradicated, but he sees that humanity will suffer, as well. He constructs a plan that he hopes will stop Cameron Hodge and the Phalanx for good. Oddly enough, his plan involves the X-Men. He talks <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\" href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" slug=\"psylocke\">Psylocke</a> into being his mole. She is \"assimilated\" and is able to regain her mind when given the command to attack the other X-Men. This comes to pass when Wolverine gets passed the Phalanx defenses, puts a small hole in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\" href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" slug=\"bishop\">Bishop</a>'s energy containment chamber, and gives Bishop an energy source. Blasting the X-Men out, the Phalanx citadel is taken down. While Lang thinks he's pulled himself out of the danger and in a position to further his quest of mutant genocide, Hodge pulls Lang into the collapsing citadel.</p><h2>Effects</h2><p>The next generation of mutants would form a group called <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15083\" href=\"/generation-x/4060-15083/\" slug=\"generation-x\">Generation X</a> and be led by Banshee and Emma Frost.</p><p>Due to the combined psi-attack of Jean Grey and Cable, Cable is able to catch some hints as to who Slym and Redd (the couple who raised him) actually were.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-37479\" href=\"/generation-x-classic/4050-37479/\" slug=\"generation-x-classic\">Generation X Classic</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-22011\" href=\"/origin-of-generation-x/4050-22011/\" slug=\"origin-of-generation-x\">Origin of Generation X</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-264307\" href=\"/essential-x-men-the-phalanx-covenant-begins/4000-264307/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-the-phalanx-covenant-begins\">Essential X-Men #18</a> (UK)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-264345\" href=\"/essential-x-men-the-phalanx-covenant-part-two/4000-264345/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-the-phalanx-covenant-part-two\">Essential X-Men #19</a> (UK)</li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2><b>Overview</b></h2><p>The X-Tinction Agenda was a nine-part crossover event (or X-Over, as X-Men crossovers are sometimes called) beginning in 1990 that took place in the pages of Uncanny X-Men, The New Mutants, and X-Factor. <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\" href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" slug=\"chris-claremont\">Chris Claremont</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31231\" href=\"/louise-simonson/4005-31231/\" slug=\"louise-simonson\">Louise Simonson</a> were the principle writers, while star artists <a data-ref-id=\"4040-2399\" href=\"/jim-lee/4040-2399/\" slug=\"jim-lee\">Jim Lee</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5181\" href=\"/rob-liefeld/4040-5181/\" slug=\"rob-liefeld\">Rob Liefeld</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-13148\" href=\"/jon-bogdanove/4040-13148/\" slug=\"jon-bogdanove\">Jon Bogdanove</a> illustrated.</p><h2><b>Plot Summary</b></h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13379\" href=\"/cameron-hodge/4005-13379/\" slug=\"cameron-hodge\">Cameron Hodge</a>, now a cyborg, sends his Magistrates, lead by a brainwashed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\" href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" slug=\"havok\">Havok</a>, to attack the X-Mansion. They capture several members of the X-Men and New Mutants, namely <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\" href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" slug=\"storm\">Storm</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\" href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" slug=\"wolfsbane\">Wolfsbane</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2159\" href=\"/boom-boom/4005-2159/\" slug=\"boom-boom\">Boom Boom</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10988\" href=\"/rictor/4005-10988/\" slug=\"rictor\">Rictor</a>. They also kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7223\" href=\"/warlock/4005-7223/\" slug=\"warlock\">Warlock</a>. After becoming mutates, Storm and Wolfsbane end up brainwashed like Havok. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28504\" href=\"/mutates/4005-28504/\" slug=\"mutates\">Mutates</a>, like the three of them, are slaves on the island nation of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\" href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" slug=\"genosha\">Genosha</a> and dominated by an elite human minority similar to apartheid. Several mutant groups from around the world gather and travel to Genosha in order to rescue their friends. They include the remaining New Mutants lead by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\" href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" slug=\"cable\">Cable</a>, X-Factor, and X-Men members previously scattered across the globe.</p><p>Once in Genosha, many of them end up captured as well, including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\" href=\"/gambit/4005-1499/\" slug=\"gambit\">Gambit</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> manages to reach Havok, and helps his brother overcome his brainwashing. At the opportune moment, Havok turns on his master, Cameron Hodge, enabling others to revolt as well. Cameron Hodge is beheaded and then buried alive by Rictor, who also causes the Genoshan capital building (known as the Citadel) to collapse onto Hodge's remains. In the wake of the battle, Havok and Wolfsbane decide to stay in Genosha in order to help rebuild the country and protect the mutant population.</p><h2>Effects</h2><h3>X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/665794-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-665794\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/665794-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-665794\"><img alt=\"The New Betsy\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/665794-5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/665794-5.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\"></a><figcaption>The New Betsy</figcaption></figure><p>Storm was programmed by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28470\" href=\"/genegineer-david-moreau/4005-28470/\" slug=\"genegineer-david-moreau\">Genegineer</a> to snap out of her mutate state with the ability to restore a mutant's power by touch. This is first manifested when she restores Cyclops's power after the trial. A side effect of coming out of her mutate condition was that Storm once again possessed an adult body and could control her powers more fully. Also, the rest of the X-Men get to see the new <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\" href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" slug=\"psylocke\">Betsy Braddock</a>. Havok stays in Genosha so as to help rebuild the country and to see that the mutates are dealt with in a humane way.</p><h3>X-Factor</h3><p>During the events of the X-Tinction Agenda, Wolverine lay dying in a cell. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a> had been placed in this cell as well and the two shared a moment of intimacy. This scene further showed the confusion Jean feels concerning the emotional bond she has with both Wolverine and Cyclops. Cyclops is shown to acknowledge that his hold on Jean is strained, at best, and tried to rein her in during some key elements of various battles. Jean showed that she still had a mind of her own and could help in whatever way would be best for the teams.</p><h3>New Mutants</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/679597-wolfsbane18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-679597\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.5547445255474\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:255.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/679597-wolfsbane18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-679597\"><img alt=\"Mutate Rahne\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/679597-wolfsbane18.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/679597-wolfsbane18.jpg 137w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px\" data-width=\"137\"></a><figcaption>Mutate Rahne</figcaption></figure><p>The team most influenced by the events of the X-Tinction Agenda. In an attempt to rescue his friends, Warlock de-powered their cell and allowed himself to be captured. This ultimately led to Cameron Hodge trying to assimilate the transmode virus, which would allow him to shift his shape. Rahne stopped the process but it was too late for Warlock. He became the only one to die at during these events. His ashes would later be spread on Doug Ramsey's grave.</p><p>In trying to stop Hodge from taking Warlock's power, Rahne herself was captured and turned into Mutate 20. Even after Storm touched her, if Rahne stayed in her human form she would still be a mindless mutate since her suit was bonded to her. She did, however, gain even more power in her wolf form. The Genegineer explained that all Rahne's former inhibitions were taken away and her mutant powers would evidence this. True to form, Rahne's lycanthropic form was far more fierce and difficult to calm. Rahne decided to leave the New Mutants and stay in Genosha to help with its rebuilding process.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4050-41405\" href=\"/x-men-x-tinction-agenda/4050-41405/\" slug=\"x-men-x-tinction-agenda\">X-Men: X-Tinction Agenda</a> Trade (2001)</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4000-323368\" href=\"/essential-x-men-volume-10/4000-323368/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-volume-10\">Essential X-Men #10</a></p><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-36643\" href=\"/x-men-programma-extinctione/4050-36643/\" slug=\"x-men-programma-extinctione\">X-Men: Programma Extinctione</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-70492\" href=\"/x-men-the-ultra-collection-book-2-of-5/4000-70492/\" slug=\"x-men-the-ultra-collection-book-2-of-5\">X-Men: The Ultra Collection #2</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p><a href=\"/stryfe/4005-7616/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7616\">Stryfe</a>, with <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a>'s visage, attempts to assassinate <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor Charles Xavier</a> during a speech on equality by shooting him in the head with a <a href=\"/techno-organic/4015-43631/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43631\">techno</a>-organic virus slug. Xavier's body is soon overrun by a virus that turns each infected cell into a technological circuit. <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> and <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert</a> work tirelessly on restoring the professor but to little avail.</p><p>As the Professor is being attacked, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> and <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> eat at Harry's Hideaway, during which <a href=\"/caliban/4005-9637/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9637\">Caliban</a> barges in and kidnaps the two. <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a> and <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a> try to help but they are attacked by two more of the <a href=\"/horsemen-of-apocalypse/4060-40423/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40423\">Horsemen of Apocalypse</a>. The foes are defeated and it seems that <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse</a> is behind the schemes to kidnap the two <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> and kill the Professor. Yet, once Cyclops and Jean Grey are handed over, it seems as if <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mr. Sinister</a> is orchestrating the events. Apocalypse is actually awakened during a regenerative sleep to be informed that actions are being done in his name.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a> seeks out the attacker with a few select members of the X-Men. <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a>, not wanting to believe their mentor could be behind such a thing, sets out in search of the real assassin. They run in to the other X-Teams and try to fight their way out. X-Force is soon apprehended and held captive in the <a href=\"/danger-room/4020-41918/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41918\">Danger Room</a>. Mr. Sinister shows up at the X-Mansion and tells that Stryfe is really behind it all.</p><p>Cable shows up and learns about the current events. Believing Canadian intelligence has the answers, Cable arrives in time be confronted by <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> and <a href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a>, two guys who had the same ideas about the Canadian intelligence, but for information on Cable's safehouses. A fight ensues and Cable talks the two others into believing that he is innocent. The three then escape the government building and teleport to <a href=\"/graymalkin/4020-42058/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42058\">Graymalkin</a>, Cable's space base, where Cable explains that he and Stryfe are both from the future and share a face. There, Wolverine receives a signal from Jean and the three men figure out the location that Cyclops and Jean are being held.</p><p>Apocalypse breaks into one of Cable's safehouses and starts to piece together that Cable or Stryfe is the son of Cyclops. He then returns to Egypt. His <a href=\"/dark-riders/4060-41074/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41074\">Dark Riders</a> are easily defeated by Stryfe. Stryfe then turns his attention to Apocalypse and nearly kills him. Apocalypse is able to teleport away before the death blow.</p><p>During the events, Stryfe has tortured and tormented Cyclops and Jean, accompanied by parental taunts. The two are finally able to escape only to find they are being held captive on the Moon.</p><p>On earth, the Beast is able to remove the techno slug, but the Professor's condition doesn't get any better. Fortunately, Apocalypse shows up and convinces the X-Men to let him help cure the Professor. After all, he did use the same stuff to form <a href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Archangel</a>'s wings, as well as infect the son of Cyclops in the <a href=\"/endgame/4045-55862/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55862\">Endgame</a> story arc. The team reluctantly agrees and Apocalypse (after regenerating) cures the Professor by accelerating the infection. With the virus out, the Professor sleeps deeply. The remaining members of the X-Men, Apocalypse included, head to the Moon.</p><p>Cable, Bishop and Wolverine are already on the Moon and under heavy attack. The X-Teams show up in time to help defeat the Dark Riders. The teams then spread out to find Cyclops and Jean, as well as Stryfe. Stryfe, meanwhile, has recaptured Cyclops and Jean and removed them to different location. Cable, <a href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\">Havok</a>, <a href=\"/polaris/4005-1473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1473\">Polaris</a>, and <a href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\">Cannonball</a> track Stryfe to a building but a gray force field only lets those in of Summers blood. Cable then fights Stryfe. Losing, Cable is able to find relief from Havok, who made it through. With the assault on Stryfe, Cyclops and Jean are able to break free of Stryfe's hold and help in the fight. Cable knows the only way to finish the fight is to take Stryfe out for good, which means taking himself out, too. Cyclops triggers the mechanism that opens a portal into which Stryfe and Cable are pulled to their supposed deaths. Cyclops doesn't know for sure, but he can't help but feel as if he's let his son go again.</p><p>Mr. Sinister is finally seen to open a canister, his payment for the part he played in Stryfe's game. Instead of the promised genetic make-up of the Summers family, the canister is supposedly empty.</p><h2>Effects</h2><h3>X-Men</h3><p>Xavier could walk again, albeit briefly, due to the effects of the techno-organic virus. <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a> was blinded by the MLF member <a href=\"/strobe/4005-27418/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27418\">Strobe</a>. The effects would only last a few weeks, but that time was spent mostly around <a href=\"/gambit/4005-1499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Gambit</a>.</p><h3>X-Force</h3><p>Cannonball stepped up and took the reigns of leadership of the team.</p><h3>Mutant Liberation Front</h3><p>Each mutant member not killed is arrested (except <a href=\"/zero/4005-14859/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14859\">Zero</a>). Only some are released when <a href=\"/reignfire/4005-15520/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15520\">Reignfire</a> later restarts the MLF.</p><h3>Cable and Stryfe</h3><p>Both men were seemingly lost into the vortex. Cable later returns, but Stryfe's mind is locked into Cable's brain. He resurfaces at later times but is always defeated.</p><h3>Mutants in General</h3><p>The canister Mr. Sinister opened wasn't empty. It actually contained the <a href=\"/legacy-virus/4015-42281/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42281\">Legacy Virus</a>, a disease that largely only affected mutants.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/x-factor-visionaries-peter-david-volume-four/4000-222635/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-222635\">X-Factor Visionaries: Peter David Vol. 4</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-x-cutioners-song/4050-42940/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42940\">X-Men: X-Cutioner's Song</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/marvel-age-/4000-157250/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-157250\">Marvel Age #116</a></li><li><a href=\"/stryfes-strike-file/4050-18149/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18149\">Stryfe's Strike File</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/what-if-69-what-if-stryfe-killed-the-x-men/4000-40329/\">What If...? #69 - What if Stryfe Killed the X-Men</a></li></ul>",

The Phoenix Force becomes the Dark Phoenix and consumes the power of a star and destroys an entire solar system before sacrificing herself to save the universe from mass destruction.",
    "description": "<p>This larger story arc \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" is broken up into two parts. The first part is <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56154\" href=\"/phoenix-saga/4045-56154/\">The Phoenix Saga</a> in (X-Men #101-108). This is the second part of the two-part series mostly taking place in X-Men #129-138.</p><h2>The Creation of the Dark Phoenix Saga</h2><p>The Dark Phoenix Saga was created because of the number of fans that loved the original <a data-ref-id=\"4050-33984\" href=\"/phoenix-saga/4050-33984/\">Phoenix Saga</a>. Marvel needed a way to bring the Phoenix back in a way like never before, so they decided to have the Phoenix come back to earth evil. They figured what better way to shock the readers than to have the once great and powerful balance maker turn evil and show its true colors. This idea resulted in the creation of the Dark Phoenix Saga.</p><h3>How it Started</h3><p>After taking some time off to find herself, Jean Grey journeyed to Muir Island. While shopping she met a strange man named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8306\" href=\"/mastermind/4005-8306/\">Jason Wyngarde</a>, who was secretly the old X-men villain \"Mastermind\". After Mastermind toyed with Jean's mind, she decided to stay on Muir Island so that Moira MacTaggart could test the full extent of her new powers. During an emergency alarm concerning Moira's son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2165\" href=\"/proteus/4005-2165/\">Proteus</a>, Jean was swept up in an illusion of herself in the 1800's as Lady Jean Grey (an ancestor of Jean's). <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\">Lady Jean Grey</a> was the wife of the era's Jason Wyngarde and Black Queen of the Hellfire Club at that time. This psychic illusion caught her off guard and she was felled by Proteus. Later during the Proteus situation, Mastermind once again took Jean into his 19th Century illusion where he convinced her that a cruel game of manhunt was her own idea!</p><p>Following the defeat of Proteus Jean returned to the mansion and very quickly got reports of 2 new mutants, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\" href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\" href=\"/dazzler/4005-1498/\">Dazzler</a>. The team decided it would be best to split up and look for the two mutants, Jean decided to search for Dazzler. When Jean researched Dazzler's last known location, she found that Dazzler worked at a nearby club so she decided to look there first. At the club where they find Dazzler was performing Jean once again saw Jason Wyngarde walking across the floor and was instantly brought back into the illusion where she was his wife. While in the illusion <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\">Cyclops's</a> face appears and Jean is able to break free from it. While Jean walked out of the club, Jason sends Hellfire grunts after her and in little time, they are all defeated.</p><p>During the assault, Wyngarde brought Jean into one last illusion where she was the Black Queen and helped him along with the Inner Circle take down the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\">X-men</a>. After that she then and took her place as their new Black Queen.</p><h3>Dark Phoenix Saga</h3><p>Jean Grey's powers were increasing it began to corrupt her and make her want more and more energy which caused Jean to develop a split-personality. At first Jean was able to control it but as time went on it became harder and harder to control. Mastermind wanted to join the Hellfire Club and captured Jean Grey by using her hunger to his advantage. Mastermind made Jean think she was in the 18th century by using hallucinations and in time, she became the “<a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\">Black Queen</a>”.</p><p>In attempt to save Jean, the X-Men were captured and chained up in the corner of the dining room. When the Hellfire Club was sitting at the table for supper Emma Frost saw Jean’s puzzled face and soon realized what was going on. She knew that Cyclops was trying to connect to Jean Grey through their telepathic connection (which only Scott and Jean shared). Emma ordered that Mastermind do something at once. Mastermind then had a telepathic battle with Cyclops inside of Jean Grey’s mind and in the end Mastermind killed Cyclops, making the real Jean Grey heartbroken. Jean reassumed control over her body and powers for a short amount of time but when the Phoenix retook control of her body she became overwhelmed with madness. The Phoenix broke free of Mastermind's illusion. Confused and angry the Dark Phoenix turned itself into a bird-like form of pure fire, and stated “No one can control the power of the Phoenix!\" and burst through the ceiling and flew to the roof. Mastermind followed her to the roof in hopes that he would still be able to control her, but soon learned that he was no match for the mighty Phoenix.</p><p>When the Phoenix was done with Mastermind, Cyclops got to the roof and called out Jean Grey’s name. That upset the Dark Phoenix so much that she broke out and yelled, “The mortal Jean Grey is no more, I am the Dark Phoenix!\". The Phoenix then felt Jean Grey retake her body once again (only for a few seconds) but manages to say the words, \"Scott, Help Me\". When the Dark Phoenix retook control, she shot a fire ball at them which blew the X-Men into a nearby park.</p><p>The Dark Phoenix then flew over to the park and told the X-Men that their destinies had come to an end and that the Dark Phoenix had come to destroy them all. Then the battle began and in the end, the X-Men lost. Cyclops (being the last to go down) was hit the hardest because he had upset the Dark Phoenix the most, mainly because he confused her. When the Dark Phoenix asked Cyclops why he had cared about the body of Jean Grey so much, he replied, “I love her”. That statement made the Dark Phoenix upset because she didn’t understand or know what the emotion felt like, so she replied, “I do not understand, your answer is unacceptable” and used a force-field to wipe him out. When Cyclops was knocked out Jean Grey retook control of her body again (this time for a longer period of time) and walked over to Cyclops’s body and started to cry.</p><p>She then said, “Don’t ever forget Scott, I will always love you.” The Dark Phoenix resumed control and became madder than ever and took the form of an enormous bird made out of pure fire. This figure was seen for hundreds and hundreds of miles. The Dark Phoenix then flew straight up into the sky until she was no longer seen. The waves of power that the Dark Phoenix gave off when she transformed into the birdlike shape were sensed by extremely powerful telepaths throughout the universe, each one showed an extremely puzzled face.</p><p>The Dark Phoenix then entered space and created a black hole to teleport into another galaxy (D’Bari Galaxy). The Dark Phoenix dove into the D’Bari’s star and started to feed on its energy until there was nothing left but a nova.</p><p>When the Shi’ar tried to attack the Dark Phoenix she then turned around and attacked back, but with little effort, luckily not destroying the Shi’ar but causing more than enough to damage to give them the hint to back off. The Dark Phoenix then flew back to earth causing the captain in charge of the spacecraft to contact the empress and give her the warning. Meanwhile when all of this was going on, Beast was creating a machine that would neutralize the power of the Dark Phoenix, but only for an extremely short period of time. Once created Beast tried to figure out where the Dark Phoenix could be headed next but had no trouble figuring it out.</p><p>Beast along with all the other X-Men (including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\">Xavier</a>) went to Jean Grey’s childhood home and waited for her to arrive. When she arrived Xavier tried to fool the Dark Phoenix by putting hallucinations into her head, making her think that her parents are sitting in the drive way waiting for her. Once Jean walked outside, the car started to pull away causing Jean to go farther and farther into the yard as she chased after it. When she was far enough, the X-Men made their move and with some luck Beast slipped the device onto Dark Phoenix’s head. At first it looked like it was working, the Dark Phoenix had fallen to the ground in pain, but after a few short seconds the Phoenix stood up and melted the device. The Dark Phoenix then became overwhelmed with rage, she laughed and taunted Beast for his failure. Dark Phoenix picked up the X-Men with her telekinetic powers, by this time it looked like the X-Men had finally came to their end, but then out of nowhere Xavier tries his best to invade the mind of the Dark Phoenix and successes. He then summoned the Dark Phoenix to a telepathic battle.</p><p>Dark Phoenix knows that Xavier is no match for her, so she decides to taunt and play around a little bit. He tries his best to defeat her, but once the Dark Phoenix had had enough she then decided to destroy him. She had almost succeeded, but Xavier called for the help of Jean Grey herself (who is in a way trapped within her own body) just in time. Together with the two extremely powerful telepaths working together, they are able to bind the Dark Phoenix into her own powers, but only for the time being.</p><p>Since the Dark Phoenix had been contained, Jean Grey was able to retake control of her body once again. Once she awoke, Jean Grey was greeted home by all her fellow X-Men. It seemed like everything had just fallen back into place. Then the Shi’ar arrived and tried to take Jean Grey away so that they could destroy her and the evil, powerful creature that was within her to ensure the universe’s safety. The empress then ordered her Imperial Guards to capture Jean. The X-Men got ready for the battle of their lives and were willing to do anything to protect Jean. Luckily for them Xavier was able to enter the mind of the empress and found out that if the Imperial Guards were challenged to a battle, they must accept it. The X-Men were then brought onto the spacecraft and were taken into space. On board, Jean Grey was accused of genocide and the only solution was death. The X-Men and the Shi’ar agreed that there would be a battle and the winner would determine Jean Grey’s fate. Once the X-Men had gotten ready they along with the Imperial Guards were then teleported to a moon where the battle would take place.</p><p>The X-Men (not knowing they were no match for the Imperial Guards) then decided to split up into pairs. After many hours of battle Jean Grey and Scott Summers were the last two left in the match. Before the two decided to give the Imperial Guards the best they had, Jean and Scott hid in a nearby cave to say their last few words before they fought for their lives. When they were done they ran out and were confronted by all of the Imperial Guards. Jean and Scott were doing great until Scott was shot down. The sight of Jean Grey’s true love falling to the ground put so much guilt and stress on her that the Dark Phoenix was able to retake control of the body once again. By doing so she sent off extremely powerful waves of power which knock off the energy flow of the Shi’ar spacecraft.</p><p>The Dark Phoenix then went after the Imperial Guards and had them feel the wraith of the Dark Phoenix. Once the Imperial Guards were out of the picture Jean Grey had retaken control of the powers and body. She knew that her control over the Dark Phoenix was not going to last long and right under the Shi’ar spacecraft. She then used her powers to boost the spacecraft’s weapon system. Thinking that the Shi’ar’s weapon was powerful enough to kill her and the Dark Phoenix she said her farewell to Scott by saying, “I love you Scott, don’t ever forget, I will always be with you.” The empress blasted the weapon directly at the Dark Phoenix. During the blast the Dark Phoenix had retaken control of the body forming once again the shape of the fire bird, then it was gone.</p><p>Thinking that the Phoenix was destroyed, the empress then teleported herself and Xavier to the moon. She apologized to Scott along with the other X-Men. Then out of nowhere the Phoenix rose from her ashes as the Phoenix Force and brought Jean Grey’s body with her. The Phoenix then apologized to all the X-Men. She explained to them how she lost her way and assured them all that it would never happen again. When Scott asked what would happen to Jean, the Phoenix Force told him that the flame within her was no more, but that with a small portion from many would be enough to restore the life within Jean Grey. The X-Men accepted the deal and they all grouped together and watched as a small part of each of them went into Jean Grey. The Phoenix then said, “I have been here too long, I must depart” and flew away. When Jean woke up, the first thing she said was Scott’s name and the saga ended with Jean Grey kissing Scott Summers.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-40248\" href=\"/x-men-dark-phoenix-saga/4050-40248/\">X-Men: Dark Phoenix Saga</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-30096\" href=\"/x-men-the-dark-phoenix-saga/4050-30096/\">X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-44329\" href=\"/x-men-legends-vol-2-the-dark-phoenix-saga/4050-44329/\">X-Men Legends Vol. 2: The Dark Phoenix Saga</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-140971\" href=\"/essential-x-men-volume-2/4000-140971/\">Essential X-Men Volume 2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-233668\" href=\"/marvel-masterworks-the-uncanny-x-men-volume-four/4000-233668/\">Marvel Masterworks: The Uncanny X-Men Volume 4</a> &amp; <a data-ref-id=\"4000-233671\" href=\"/marvel-masterworks-the-uncanny-x-men-volume-five/4000-233671/\">Volume 5</a></li><li><span><a data-ref-id=\"4050-27512\" href=\"/uncanny-x-men-omnibus/4050-27512/\">Uncanny X-Men Omnibus</a></span></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-21393\" href=\"/what-if-what-if-phoenix-had-not-died/4000-21393/\">What If? #27</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-25193\" href=\"/x-men-messiah-complex-mutant-files/4050-25193/\">Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2> </h2><p> </p><h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The story recounts the beginning of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman and Jim Gordon's with the Gotham City Police Department.</p><p>Bruce Wayne, aged 25, returns home from training abroad in martial arts, manhunting and science for nearly twelve years. In Gotham, he bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike, all the while preparing himself. Gordon, meanwhile, has moved to Gotham from Chicago with his pregnant wife, Barbara Kean-Gordon, and pursues a career in law enforcement. His first time out patrolling reveals to him the disturbing nature of law enforcement in Gotham as a senior officer, Detective Flass, assaults an unsuspecting teenager for \"staying out late\". Gordon is disgusted with his partner's behavior towards all the \"offenders\" Jim feels that he has to straighten things out.</p><p>Bruce makes preparations - registering at a hotel to provide an alibi, giving himself a fake scar to disguise himself - before going out for his first street mission. He enters the Red Light District of Gotham. A young prostitute named Holly Robinson tries to proposition him. Her pimp, angry because he knows Bruce isn't the type to hire prostitutes, forcefully drags her away. Bruce confronts him and gets into a fight, and a few others join in. Selina Kyle, a dominatrix in the slums of Gotham, jumps from her window and fights with Bruce; he is stabbed in the thigh by Holly.</p><p>The police arrive on the scene, shoot Bruce and then throw him into the back seat of their car. On the way to the station, he manages to escape by causing the corrupt officers to wreck their squad car. After pulling the unconscious officers out of the car Bruce returns home, bleeding from his various wounds. There he sits, looking for inspiration, something he feels will strike fear into the hearts of criminals. A bat crashes into the room through a window and perches on a sculpture of his father, to which Bruce immediately responds. He has found what he is looking for, stating the words \"Yes Father, I will become a bat.\"</p><p>Gordon tries to clean up GCPD, but on the orders of the corrupt Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb, is attacked and threatened by fellow officers. After recovering, he visits the house of one of these officers, where they have gathered to play poker. He waits for Detective Flass, who he knows is responsible for organizing the attack. Flass is the last to leave, and Gordon tails him into the woods, where he proceeds to attack the drunken officer.</p><p>Bruce goes out for the first time as Batman and stops a trio of teenagers from stealing a television. A brief struggle ensues, resulting in the Dark Knight's first victory. The legend quickly grows with Batman attacking criminals with increasing boldness, including Flass, who was present at one crime, receiving a pay off from the criminals. One night, when the corrupt city leaders and gangsters like Carmine Falcone gather for a dinner party, Commissioner Loeb explains why Batman is politically advantageous to themselves, assuming he would never bother them; meanwhile, Batman sneaks onto the grounds, puts the guards to sleep and sets up stage lights around the window that comprises one of the dining room walls. He cuts the electricity, throwing the room in darkness, blows a hole in the outside wall and then activates the lights. He gives the men and women a dire warning that he is just as determined to deliver them to justice as well, then leaves. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle is inspired to become a costumed cat burglar when she sees Batman in action and becomes Catwoman.</p><p>The police try to capture Batman numerous times, but Bruce is too elusive and alert to fall for their traps. In addition, the maverick district attorney, Harvey Dent, becomes Batman's secret ally. After a night of following useless leads, Gordon and his partner, Detective Sarah Essen, see a truck barreling down the street. They give chase and Gordon hands the wheel over to Essen as he tries to get into the vehicle. An old, homeless woman stands in the way of the truck and is about to be run over just as soon as Batman jumps in and shoves her out of the way. The bus runs into a wall and Gordon briefly blacks out, only to awake moments later and find Essen holding Batman at gunpoint. She is momentarily distracted when she turns to ask if he is all right and Batman takes advantage to disarm her and flee into an abandoned building.</p><p>When cops arrive on the scene, the commissioner is quick to call in the trigger-happy Branden and his squad to drop a bomb on the building, which the Commissioner claims has already been scheduled for demolition. While dodging the fire from the explosion, Batman's belt (which contained explosives) catches fire, and he is forced to discard it. After suffering two dizzying gun wounds, Batman escapes into the secure basement and survives the blast. A crowd gathers outside the building. Stuck with only a blow gun and 3 darts, Batman uses a small device in his boot to summon thousands of bats from his cave to the building. A battle occurs as the police storm into the building and hunt him down. He incapacitates some and even saves a cat, jumping out of the building (after throwing a police officer forcefully through a wall) and takes advantage of the chaos that occurs when the bat colony arrives to speed away on a police motorcycle and escape.</p><p>Gordon has a brief affair with Essen. During the affair, he is confronted by the Commissioner, who threatens to inform his wife of the affair if he doesn't comply. Gordon, after bringing his wife to an interview with Bruce Wayne, whom he and others suspect of being Batman, stops the car in the driveway on the way back and tells her about his affair. Essen later leaves for New York.</p><p>Months pass and Batman overhears a local mafia boss planning revenge against Gordon. Selina Kyle, frustrated because she feels her petty crimes aren't enough, interferes and attacks the group. Batman does not appear, but helps Selina from the shadows, throwing small bat-shaped blades laced with tranquilizers at some of the men. Bruce, while working out, figures out the plan based on the part of the conversation he was able to record.</p><p>Gordon is called away by the police to investigate a robbery. On his way out, a mysterious motorist entering his garage raises Gordon's suspicions, as Gordon has never seen the motorist. He returns to the garage only to find his wife and baby being pulled into a car. He shoots and kills the men trying to take his wife, who survives; however, one assailant is unharmed. The car leaves with Gordon's baby in it, and Gordon shoots the motorist, takes his motorcycle and follows. The motorist, Bruce, is unharmed thanks to a bullet-proof vest. He attempts to leave, but not before Barbara threatens to shoot him. She lets him go when he promises to save her baby, takes a bicycle from a passing stranger, and pursues Gordon and the car.</p><p>Gordon shoots out a wheel on the car and it crashes into the side of a bridge. The don's hired knife, his nephew, exits the car, baby in hand. A struggle ensues and the baby is thrown off the bridge, followed by Gordon. However, Bruce had already arrived and dived after the baby before Gordon even falls over the rail. Gordon, having lost his glasses in the struggle with the hitman, thanks Bruce (whom he claims to not recognize due to his aforementioned missing glasses) and makes it clear that he won't turn him in.</p><p>Dent and Batman's efforts bear fruit with Flass, who is persuaded to turn damaging states evidence against his superiors, including a disgraced Commissioner Loeb, who is forced to resign. Although his immediate replacement, Grogan, is apparently worse, Gordon is content for the moment with receiving a job promotion and family counseling with his wife. The story ends with the new Captain Gordon waiting on the rooftop of the GCPD headquarters for Batman, to discuss somebody called The Joker and his scheme to poison the reservoir.</p><p>The story also includes the first appearance of Mafia don Carmine Falcone.</p><p> </p><p>It has been announced that there will be an animated movie made.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/batman-year-one/4050-18960/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18960\">Batman: Year One</a></li></ul><h2>Other</h2><p>There is an adaptation of Frank Miller's <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batman-year-one/4025-1339/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1339\">Batman Year One</a> story that is being turned into a DC Animated Movie.</p>",

The media also reflects on the anniversary of the final sighting of Gotham's first vigilante, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47593\" href=\"/reaper/4005-47593/\" slug=\"reaper\">The Reaper</a>.</p><p>Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, in the meantime is visited by an old acquaintance, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3740\" href=\"/leslie-thompkins/4005-3740/\" slug=\"leslie-thompkins\">Leslie Thompkins</a>, the medic who helped to raise him after his parents were murdered, and knows all too well of his double life. She is joined by Judson Caspian, and his daughter Rachel, who gradually develops a romantic infatuation with Bruce Wayne.</p><p>It soon comes to light that Judson is really The Reaper, driven to his life by the tragic death of his wife and it takes only one stroll down Gotham to remind Judson of the horrors of crime he thought he had put to rest long ago in his dual identity; he returns to his apartment and dons The Reaper costume. Immediately making an impact and leaving several criminal heavies dead, Batman and The Reaper soon come face to face, but The Reaper's experience and weaponry prove too much for Batman, and he is left bloodied, broken, and forced to flee before he is killed. Upon returning to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55767\" href=\"/wayne-manor/4020-55767/\" slug=\"wayne-manor\">Wayne Manor</a>, a bandaged, injured Bruce angrilly admits that his best wasn't enough, and that perhaps the only way to confront a killer with his measure of thinking head on is to become that which he loathes the most, prompting him to now bear a firearm, the gun that took the lives of his parents.</p><p>Batman's vendetta against The Reaper leads to a falling out with Gordon, whom Batman nearly wounds or kills to prevent him from getting closer to what he considers his prey. Gordon misinterprets this action as Batman following in The Reaper's murderous footsteps, and soon deploys his forces against both Batman and The Reaper. As The Reaper lays waste to Gotham's underworld, various crimelords assemble and discuss ways of defeating him. Batman eventually intervenes in the meetings, and proposes they join forces against The Reaper. The crimelords agree, but only if Batman cooperates with a hand picked agent of their choosing; that individual is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32672\" href=\"/joe-chill/4005-32672/\" slug=\"joe-chill\">Joe Chill</a>, the man who shot <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3602\" href=\"/thomas-wayne/4005-3602/\" slug=\"thomas-wayne\">Thomas</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3603\" href=\"/martha-wayne/4005-3603/\" slug=\"martha-wayne\">Martha Wayne</a>. Knowing his reason for being is working alongside him, Batman schemes to take Chill's life once The Reaper is disposed of, whilst at the same time he lays the groundwork for his life after Batman, asking Rachel not to convert to a nunnery and marry him. She accepts.</p><p>There is a battle which kills most of the underworld connections tied to Batman and Chill, as well as helping convince Gordon that Batman is not connected to The Reaper in his crimes. The Reaper is presumed dead, Batman and Chill escape separately, but meet up later at night at Batman's insistence. Batman takes Chill to a familiar alley... the alley where Chill took the lives of the Waynes. Batman reveals his identity to the shocked Chill and taunts him with the gun he used on them. Chill, stunned, remains composed, convinced that Batman will not pull the trigger; before Bruce can find out, The Reaper re-emerges and kills Chill point blank with a gunshot. Now knowing Bruce's identity, The Reaper beckons Batman to a final confrontation in the frameworks of the under-construction Wayne Foundation. There Batman and The Reaper fight to a standstill, and Batman eventually discovers The Reaper is Judson before he jumps and kills himself.</p><p>Bruce returns to Rachel, who has heard the news from television. Her path is now clear: Judson was her father, and she must atone for his sins. She produces her nun dressings and calls off the engagement. Bruce returns to prowl Gotham's streets as its sole vigilante for the present.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-51491\" href=\"/batman-year-two/4050-51491/\" slug=\"batman-year-two\">Batman: Year Two</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-25200\" href=\"/batman-year-two-fear-the-reaper/4050-25200/\" slug=\"batman-year-two-fear-the-reaper\">Batman: Year Two: Fear The Reaper</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Death resurrects Thanos who acquires the six infinity gems and kills half the life in the universe in her honor with the Infinity Gauntlet. Adam Warlock leads Earth's Mightiest Heroes against the Mad Titan.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The Infinity Gauntlet is a six issue miniseries written by <a href=\"/jim-starlin/4040-7922/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7922\">Jim Starlin</a>, penciled by <a href=\"/george-perez/4040-2913/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2913\">George Perez</a> and inked by <a href=\"/ron-lim/4040-3258/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3258\">Ron Lim</a> published in 1991.</p><p>Mistress <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a> is upset that the balance between life and death has recently not been in her favor. Her solution is to give her ardent follower, <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a>, a chance at rebirth setting him forth with a mission of killing half the life in the universe. Despite his powers, Thanos realizes his mission is near impossible. Remembering the <a href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\">Infinity Gems</a> that were instrumental in his death, he peered into the Infinity Well to discover their secrets. He divines the true nature of the gems, and their current owners.</p><h3>The Thanos Quest</h3><p>Thanos discovers that the Infinity Gems are currently in possession of the <a href=\"/elders-of-the-universe/4060-41142/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41142\">Elders of the Universe</a> with the Soul Gem in possession of the <a href=\"/in-betweener/4005-13354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13354\">In-Betweener</a>. With cunning, Thanos is able to obtain possession of the gems. He then places the gems on the <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a>, and becomes the most powerful being in the universe.</p><h3>The Infinity Gauntlet</h3><p>Thanos immediately fulfills his objective and kills half of all life in the universe. He also brings a tortured <a href=\"/nebula/4005-14558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14558\">Nebula</a> (who alleges to be his granddaughter) as a sacrifice to Death. But because Thanos is so powerful, becoming superior to Death in every facet, Thanos' hope of being treated as an equal escapes his grasp. He gleans from Death that they are not equal, and Death becomes subservient to him. This infuriates Thanos who doesn't want Death as a slave but as a lover. In an attempt to make Death jealous, he creates a mate, <a href=\"/terraxia/4005-28004/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28004\">Terraxia</a>.</p><p>On earth, the heroes are informed by the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> as to the reason for the monumental genocide. All of Marvel's mightiest heroes band together to try to defeat Thanos and save the universe. Despite previous conflicts with the Mad Titan, Thanos still remains a mystery. <a href=\"/adam-warlock/4005-6805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\">Adam Warlock</a>, one of Thanos' most persistent foes, is asked to lead the forces.</p><p>Knowing full well the impossible odds, Adam Warlock and Silver Surfer attempt cosmic diplomacy in the hopes of thwarting Thanos. The two heroes meet up with <a href=\"/epoch/4005-6143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6143\">Epoch</a> and her cosmic champion <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a> and a cosmic summit of the great cosmic powers begins. It includes <a href=\"/eternity/4005-11332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11332\">Eternity</a>, the <a href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\">Watcher</a> Uatu, <a href=\"/kronos/4005-28005/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28005\">Kronos</a>, <a href=\"/lord-chaos/4005-12903/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12903\">Lord Chaos</a>, <a href=\"/master-order/4005-12904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12904\">Master Order</a>, the <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a>, <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>, <a href=\"/stranger/4005-13332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13332\">Stranger</a>, <a href=\"/love/4005-28006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28006\">Love</a> and <a href=\"/hate/4005-28007/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28007\">Hate</a> and the <a href=\"/living-tribunal/4005-6811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6811\">Living Tribunal</a>. In the summit Eternity tries to convince the Living Tribunal to intervene. The Living Tribunal refuses, in since he believes that if Thanos were to replace Eternity it would still be within the process in natural selection. After seeing this, Adam Warlock persuades the Cosmic powers to aid them in stopping Thanos.</p><p>Thanos is fully aware of the coming conflict. <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a> arrives and advises Thanos to remove his omniscience to make the fight somewhat fair in the hopes of impressing Death. Despite the machinations of Mephisto, the battle is grueling and over quickly for the heroes. Thanos dispatched the heroes with ease. Some examples of the carnage include Terraxia murdering <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> and decapitating <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>. The X-men fared no better, as Wolverine had his adamantium skeleton turned to spongy rubber and <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> had his head trapped in a cube, stopping his optic blasts and suffocating him. Cosmic heroes like <a href=\"/nova/4005-2105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2105\">Nova</a> was turned into small cubes, and with <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a>, Thanos causes the <a href=\"/quantum-bands/4055-42361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42361\">Quantum Bands</a> upon his wrists to explode and then disintegrated him. Fearsome foes like Thor were turned to glass. The last man standing was <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, who made his last stand. Absent from the battle and light years away were the Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock, who knew and fully expected the frontal assault to fail. The key to the real strategy was Mephisto's involvement. After shattering Captain America's shield, Thanos raised his fist to deliver the final blow. This was the cue for Adam Warlock's true plan to go into effect as Surfer rushed in to steal the gauntlet. This gambit failed, and Thanos realized how close he was to failure himself. He once again reinstated his omniscience, and became all-powerful, all-knowing once again.</p><p>It was then that the Cosmic forces themselves attacked. The mighty forces, each near-omnipotent on their own, were no match for the omnipotence the Infinity Gauntlet bestowed upon Thanos. Eternity and Thanos had a final epic battle where Thanos perseveres, becoming the embodiment of this universe's reality. Thanos sheds his mortal form and takes his place Eternity's replacement. Nebula seizes this opportunity to take the gauntlet from the former body of Thanos. Thanos realizes his error and joins with the remaining heroes and cosmic forces to defeat the now omnipotent Nebula. Their relentless attack on the confused Gauntlet wielder allows Adam Warlock to enter the Soul Gem, a gem he is intimately attached to. From within the Soul Gem he links with the other Infinity Gems and causes the gems to feedback on Nebula, causing her to remove it.</p><p>Adam Warlock then becomes wielder of the Gauntlet. In an attempt to be a \"perfect\" god, Warlock's first use of the power was to expel from his soul the Good and Evil. This was the first step to his reign as God. But before he can begin, the Living Tribunal appears and deems Warlock too unstable and therefore unfit to wield the power. He didn't appear previously because he knew that Thanos wouldn't upset the delicate balance of the universe. Without morals or vices, with his sole focus of being a god being undermined, Warlock violently reacts to the Living Tribunal's judgment. The Living Tribunal dismisses Warlock's uses of the Gauntlet and deems that they would no longer be able to function together, preventing anyone from achieving omnipotence through possession of the gems. The gems separate, and Adam Warlock forms <a href=\"/infinity-watch/4060-25623/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25623\">Infinity Watch</a> to safeguard the powerful and dangerous <a href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\">Infinity Gems</a>. Thanos retreats to a life of farming to reflect on his life, death, and brush with godhood.</p><h2>Related Story-Arcs</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/rebirth-of-thanos/4045-56580/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56580\">Rebirth of Thanos</a> - this story arc set the stage to bring Thanos back into the limelight of the Marvel Universe and was the immediate precursor for Infinity Gauntlet.</li></ul><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/avengers-and-the-infinity-gauntlet-avengers-and-the-infinity-gauntlet/4000-267234/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-267234\">Avengers and the Infinity Gauntlet</a></li><li><a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4050-30365/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30365\">Infinity Gauntlet</a> (TPB)</li><li>Infinity Gauntlet (HC)</li><li><a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet-infinity-gauntlet/4000-187097/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-187097\">Infinity Gauntlet #1: Infinity Gauntlet</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/blockbusters-of-the-marvel-universe/4050-38679/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38679\">Blockbusters of the Marvel Universe</a></li><li><a href=\"/what-if-what-if-the-silver-surfer-possessed-the-infinity-gauntlet/4000-37242/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-37242\">What If...? #49 - What If the Silver Surfer possessed the Infinity Gauntlet?</a></li><li><a href=\"/what-if-finders-keepers/4000-44577/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-44577\">What If...? #104 - Finders Keepers</a></li><li><a href=\"/what-the--24-the-infinity-mitten/4000-138243/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-138243\">What The--?! #24</a> </li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/marvel-exklusiv-/4000-291718/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-291718\">Marvel Exklusiv #20</a></li><li><a href=\"/supereroi-le-grandi-saghe-il-guanto-dellinfinito/4000-334840/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-334840\">Super-Eroi Le Grando Saghe #80</a> (Italy)</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>After having his telepathic affair with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" slug=\"emma-frost\">Emma Frost</a> discovered by his wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> leaves the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" slug=\"xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" slug=\"x-men\">X-Men</a>. Not knowing what to do, he goes to the Hellfire Club to watch the exotic dancers and get drunk. What he doesn't expect to find there is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a>. Wolverine invites him to do some \"serious drinking\", and turns it into a wager. If Scott can out-drink Wolverine then he can get back to doing whatever he wanted to do. If Wolverine wins Scott needs to help him out with a mission. Wolverine had arrived with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4281\" href=\"/fantomex/4005-4281/\" slug=\"fantomex\">Fantomex</a>, who had promised to help him uncover the truth behind their origin and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40591\" href=\"/weapon-plus/4060-40591/\" slug=\"weapon-plus\">Weapon Plus</a> program. Wolverine tracked down Scott to help them. Scott lost the wager and passes out.</p><p>Cyclops, Wolverine, and Fantomex arrive to Weapon Plus's <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41078\" href=\"/the-world/4020-41078/\" slug=\"the-world\">The World</a> to find that someone had already been there before them. The remains of a team of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\" href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" slug=\"aim\">A.I.M</a> agents is all over the place and the only remaining member is not in a position to tell them much. Fantomex deduces that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41077\" href=\"/ultimaton/4005-41077/\" slug=\"ultimaton\">Ultimaton</a> (Weapon XV) had killed the agents. He explains that within The World time is artificial, and can be sped up, slowed down, or stopped completely. The inhabitants of The World were engineered from biological creatures as well as micro-sentinel technology. Speeding up time within The World and regular Gamma radiation bombardment allowed Weapon Plus to artificially stimulate evolution within the inhabitants. Their goal was to create super-human soldiers to fight in the pending war between humanity and mutant kind.</p><p>Fantomex pauses time within The World and they venture inside the dome to locate Weapon IV. It has not been long on the outside since Fantomex escaped The World, but inside the dome generations had passed. Within the world they saw World Police Cars driven by whale brains, and massive destruction. All of the other inhabitants of the world were killed by Weapon XV. The doors to the world slam shut as the last surviving agent of the A.I.M. raid turns time within The World back on, releasing Weapon XV from stasis. The three are able to find XV quickly, but are of little use against him. Fantomex signals for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45709\" href=\"/eva/4005-45709/\" slug=\"eva\">E.V.A</a> to regain control of The World from the A.I.M. agent, but when she gets to the controls she realizes that Weapon XV has locked her out. After beating Wolverine, Cyclops, and Fantomex in combat, Weapon XV smashes out of The World, freeing himself.</p><p>Within E.V.A. they tracked Ultimaton to a nearly completed space-station orbiting around the Earth. Within they found the records of the Weapon Plus program, as well as its plans. The Super-Sentinels that were Weapon XII through XV were designed to rid the world of mutants. Within the station EVA was captured by Weapon Plus, and killed. Wolverine had read the files about himself and those that came before him, learning that the Weapon Plus program started back in World War II with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America</a>: Weapon I. Wolverine also discovered that there was a traitor within the mansion, someone sent to infiltrate them. Ultimaton found Wolverine and before he could do anything Wolverine triggered the auto-destruct for the station. Cyclops and Fantomex are able to escape in one of the planes.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" slug=\"professor-x\">Professor X</a> uses <a data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\" href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" slug=\"cerebro\">Cerebro</a> to find Wolverine is still in space.

After the events of the <a href=\"/planet-hulk/4045-41213/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41213\">Planet Hulk</a> storyline Hulk has defeated the <a href=\"/red-king/4005-14846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14846\">Red King</a>, become a king and a savior to a world full of aliens, liberated the spikes, and found a wife and family in <a href=\"/caiera/4005-42037/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42037\">Caiera</a> and their unborn child. For the first time in his life Hulk is happy. However, all this was taken away when the shuttle exploded and destroyed hulks kingdom along with his wife and unborn child. Thus, he sets off on a quest to avenge his fallen, and make the illuminati pay for what they have done. Little did he know that it was his companion, Miek, that was at fault here.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p>Everything Hulk has worked so hard to build comes crashing down around him when the ship that brought him to Sakaar is investigated. The Sakaar people did not care about Hulk's origin, or that he was there because the Illuminati of earth saw fit to banish Hulk, they cared only about Hulk's actions since coming to Sakaar. The Sakaar people made the ship into a shrine celebrating Hulk's arrival and their subsequent liberation . When Hulk and Caiera are brought to view this Shrine, the ship begins to emit overload warnings. Angered once again at those who sent him there, Hulk grabs the ship and hurls it into the sky. Hulk's actions did not matter as the ship exploded before leaving the planet's atmosphere, destroying virtually all life on the planet including Caiera. Hulk is left alone and hurt, king of a now broken and desolate planet that threatens to take Hulk as well. Hulk's <a href=\"/warbound/4060-43240/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43240\">Warbound</a> are all that survives the destruction of Sakaar, and with a robot that can navigate most of the known universe Hulk, <a href=\"/korg/4005-43225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43225\">Korg</a>, <a href=\"/miek/4005-43226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43226\">Miek</a>, <a href=\"/no-name/4005-43277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43277\">No-name</a> the Broodspawn, <a href=\"/elloe/4005-43228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43228\">Elloe</a>, and <a href=\"/hiroim/4005-43227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43227\">Hiroim</a> forge weapons and plot a course to Earth to seek revenge on those that destroyed their paradise.</p><p>On the way back to Earth the true nature of Hulk's rage begins to frighten his allies. When a group of alien parasites sweeps over the ship intending to take it for themselves, Hulk loses control to his anger. Hulk tears through the invading aliens not even seeing them, but instead seeing only the faces of those that sent him away. Wanting to help their comrade, No-name and Korg exited the ship to assist Hulk. Still seeing the faces of the Illuminati in everyone around him Hulk nearly kills two of his closest allies. Concerned for the Hulk as well as their own safety, Hiroim teaches Hulk to meditate, helping him to control and direct his anger while still keeping in control of his rage. Hulk works with Hiroim to develop a plan of action. Using Hulk's knowledge of his enemies strengths and weaknesses, Hiroim is able to come up with a plan of attack, starting with taking out their most powerful enemy, <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a> the king of the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a>. Meanwhile, back on Earth <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a> has been depowered. After she learned about what the Illuminati did by sending her cousin into space, she punched out <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, the director of <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a>. Also, feeling that he owes Hulk a debt for saving his life, <a href=\"/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\">Amadeus Cho</a> is working to assemble a group of Hulk's most powerful allies to support Hulk upon his return.</p><p><b>Dawn of War</b></p><p>Hulk arrives first on the Earth's Moon, facing off against <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a> and <a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa</a> of the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a>. Hulk is warned that a single whisper on the lips of Black Bolt can destroy Hulk. Attacking the King, Hulk is hurled backward by the power of Black Bolt's whisper. Enraged, the Hulk attacks again telling Black Bolt that Hulk didn't come for a whisper and wants to hear him scream. He projects an image of himself in New York City, and talks about the bad that Dr. Strange, Iron Man, Black Bolt, and Mr. Fantastic have done to him. He urges that Manhattan be evacuated, or, as he holds up a mauled Black Bolt, \"I will do THIS to your whole puny planet.\" Shortly afterwards, New York's heroes are seen evacuating Manhattan, to the public's disapproval. Iron Man offered complete freedom to any unregistered hero who would register, and also fight on the side of Earth, against Hulk.</p><p><b>World War</b></p><p>Iron Man dons his \"Hulkbuster\" Suit, in hopes of defeating Hulk. As the fight rages on, Iron Man, in a monologue, takes full responsibility for the incident, and explains that he knew that this day would come, as soon as he heard news that Hulk had not reached his destination. As they are battling, Iron Man injects nanobots into Hulk's bloodstream. This was supposed to slow him down, but hasn't seemed to take effect yet. After much fighting in the now empty Manhattan, Iron Man seems to have defeated Hulk. But, after a flashback of the death of his wife, Caiera, he only becomes angrier. He bursts from the crater his body had created, and dominates Iron Man.</p><p>Next, he sets his eyes on Reed Richards. All of the Fantastic Four comes to his aid including its temporary members Black Panther and Storm. After the ensuing battle in which the Fantastic Four is defeated Reed escapes to find Sentry, one of Hulks best friends. Sentry recalled his last visit with the Hulk when he was battling the Void and decides not to go. With this news Reed tries to create the illusion that Sentry is appearing in an effort to quell the Hulks rage. This does not work.</p><p>After defeating the Fantastic Four the Hulk sets out to kill Doctor Strange. Strange unleashes the power of the Sorceror Supreme only to be defeated by the Hulk. Strange then fuses with the demon Zom replacing his shattered hands with battle axes. Somehow the Hulk still managed to defeat Dr. Strange.</p><p>Hulk and the Warbound then decide to build a coliseum. In it Hulk has the super hero Mister Fantastic fight Tony without his armor using control units from Sakaar. Eventually Reed defeats Tony and ordered to kill him but before anything can happens Hulk stops the telling them he came for \"justice not murder\". Hulk also tells them of his plan to destroy New York with no one in it and to leave the Illuminati in defeat. Then before this destruction the Sentry finally makes a appearance. They battle for a very long time and in the end the two lead to a stalemate, with both reverting to human forms as Banner weakly throws the last punch leaving Reynolds to collapse before him. As Banner extends his hand to Rick Jones as truce, Miek one of the Warbound lashes out at Banner but strikes Rick instead. This causes Bruce to revert back to the Hulk and angrily attacks Miek. It is then Miek reveals the truth. He says that Hulk conquered Sakaar and killed the Red King. But he should also have slaughtered his people. Instead he let them live. So, he watched as they loaded an old warp core into the shuttle that brought the Hulk in the first place. He didn't warn anyone or stop the Red King's followers as he knew, that it wouldn't kill the Hulk, it would just remind him what he was made for. As No-Name assault Miek brutally in retaliation, Miek's betrayal angers the Hulk and his rage increases beyond anything he has ever felt. In his rage, Hulk releases so much energy that each of his footsteps causes tremors alongside the entire eastern seaboard, throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York. Screaming out his hatred and rage, he asked the heroes to stop him before he 'breaks the world'.</p><p>In defense Iron Man then activates a series of satellite anti-gamma lasers which fire and finally ends the Hulk's prolonged rampage. Leading to the arrest of Bruce Banner. Now (Banner) locked up three miles inside the Earths crust inside a Shield prison lies in a coma-like state. As then Skaar, son of Hulk, rises from the destruction of Sakaar. What happens now awaits to be seen.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"../../fantastic-four-by-j-michael-straczynski-fantastic-four-by-j-michael-straczynski/37-259825/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four by J.

    "description": "<p><a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a> checking on a energy reading heading toward Earth found <a href=\"/jack-of-hearts/4005-7213/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7213\">Jack Of Hearts</a> leading a rag-tag group of tethered hulls. He confronted Jack, who responded with naked aggression having taxed his powers and patience to the limit on his trip from the <a href=\"/stranger/4005-13332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13332\">Stranger</a>’s lab world. After a brief struggle Jack found himself betrayed by two other members of the entourage the <a href=\"/presence/4005-11340/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11340\">Presence</a> and <a href=\"/red-guardian/4005-7581/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7581\">Red Guardian</a> II. The Presence attempted to kill Quasar outright, but when Jack refused to take part in murder he blasted him instead. Then with a close-range blast to the temples he thought Quasar dead. However Quasar quantum-jumped at the last possible second. Finding that the Presence was heading Earthward in one direction while the tethered refugee ships headed into the atmosphere in another threatening to burn up. He caught up with the ships as they entered Russian airspace and he rendered them invisible to radar and planted them down in Siberia. He questioned the occupants of the ships and found that despite their very alien appearances in some cases they were all very human. He then found that <a href=\"/eon/4005-13348/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13348\">Eon</a> (his cosmic mentor) was under direct attack and was forced to leave them there.</p><p>He radioed ahead to the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, telling them that a couple of cosmic level menaces were breaking into a lower level of their building. The FF was able to capture the Red Guardian II, and Quasar was able to arrive in time to protect Eon by trapping the Presence in the Eonverse. Feeling that he had saved his mentor from the “Cosmic Assassin”, Quasar decided it was time to celebrate. He instead found the girl he was just starting a relationship with in the arms of his best friend, <a href=\"/makkari/4005-13945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13945\">Makkari</a>. In his anger, he left the scene without a word to either of them. He traveled to his father’s house and found him dead on the kitchen floor. He learned to his shock that his father had been dead since Quasar was at the Stranger’s Lab world weeks earlier. Quasar felt betrayed. Eon chose to re-animate <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/gilbert-vaughn/4005-29147/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29147\">Gilbert Vaughn</a> because he was certain that the Cosmic Assassin had killed him to throw off Quasar’s mental stability, and Eon was not convinced that the Presence had been the threat that Quasar had been appointed to combat. Quasar quit as Protector and told Eon to stay out of his life. It was as he had driven a wedge between Eon and his Protector that the true Cosmic Assassin chose to reveal himself.</p><p>Malcolm Stromberg, a wealthy philanthropist wanted to gain the services of Vaughn Securities and offered the entire staff over to his mansion for an extravagant dinner. After some very brief pleasantries, Mr. Stromberg began to tell a story his past, about how he was a <a href=\"/deviants/4060-13345/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13345\">Deviants</a>/<a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a> hybrid, and that he knew Wendell Vaughn’s identity as Quasar, saying in no uncertain terms that he wanted Quasar’s <a href=\"/quantum-bands/4055-42361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42361\">Quantum Bands</a>. Not knowing what else to do, Quasar attacked only to find his beams bending around Stromberg. Quasar attempted to parlay for the release of his friends as Stromberg held him motionless in mid-air seeming through some mastery of kinetic energy. Stromberg would have none of it and over the course of several minutes cut Quasar’s arms off with a steak knife as his friends were powerless to do anything but watch. Malcolm Stromberg then revealed himself to be none other than <a href=\"/maelstrom/4005-2493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2493\">Maelstrom</a>, the Cosmic Assassin.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060342-qvstrom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060342\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.36770833333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:36.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060342-qvstrom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060342\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2355/1060342-qvstrom.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060342-qvstrom.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2355/1060342-qvstrom.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Maelstrom learned over the course of hours how to augment his own power with the near limitless might of the Quantum-bands. He then traveled to the Eonverse with the intent to kill Eon and take the secret of Cosmic Awareness from it. Back on Earth, after several hours of being strung up like a slaughtered lamb, <a href=\"/deathurge/4005-2492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2492\">Deathurge</a> appears to Quasar; explains that he could release him from this torment, taunting him, even getting Quasar to beg for death, but then Deathurge reminds him of his prophetic warning all those months ago on the surface of Uranus, Deathurge refuses Quasar’s plea and leaves. Later, after he is whipped repeatedly by one of Maelstrom’s minions, Quasar finally died when his personal death avatar (Kid Reaper) appeared before him and stabbed him through the heart. Maelstrom immediately donned the Quantum-bands and began burning large swaths through Eon’s body with Quantum energy.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060344-quasar___maelstrom_holding_forearms.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060344\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.305\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060344-quasar___maelstrom_holding_forearms.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060344\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060344-quasar___maelstrom_holding_forearms.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060344-quasar___maelstrom_holding_forearms.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a></figure><p>Now, in the empty void there is an energy wraith that appears to be a still armless Quasar. Kid Reaper appears next to him as they assess the situation, Kid Reaper admits that this has never happened to him before and he has no idea what this place is. Quasar realizes that dead or alive, he still has a responsibility to Eon and the universe, no matter form he is in. He realizes that the energy manifestation of his starscaped cape can send him wherever he wishes to go. So, he travels through it and re-appeared in the Eonverse.</p><p>Once there, Eon directs him to Maelstrom but asks that Quasar kill Eon before Maelstrom can steal cosmic awareness from him. Explaining that if Maelstrom is able to learn the secrets of the universe, then there is no telling the damage he could do. Thinking that Eon is the one animating him, Quasar figures he’ll probably cease to exist once Eon is dead, so Quasar asks Kid Reaper that once Quasar is dead to contact the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> and have them kick Maelstrom’s butt.</p><p>Quasar quickly arrives at the base of Eon’s brain, which is about the size of a moon, where Maelstrom reclines in a chair and has created various probes into the grey matter. Maelstrom hears Eon explain where Quasar should fire a blast that would result in immediate death for Eon. Maelstrom howls in rage at the sudden re-appearance of his adversary and attempts to blast him into nothingness, but since the energy-wraith Quasar is made from the same energy type that the Quantum-bands produce the beam passes harmlessly through him. Quasar responds by heeding his mentor’s wishes and firing a bolt of energy right into Eon’s Brainstem.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060345-mdrain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060345\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5333333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060345-mdrain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060345\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" data-width=\"626\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2355/1060345-mdrain.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060345-mdrain.jpg 720w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2355/1060345-mdrain.jpg 626w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2355/1060345-mdrain.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060345-mdrain.jpg 720w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2355/1060345-mdrain.jpg 626w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" data-width=\"626\"></noscript></a></figure><p>As the smoke and dust clears Quasar is shocked to find himself still in existence and Maelstrom is fully enraged by this turn of events. It’s then that Quasar finds that as his last act, Eon passed cosmic awareness to him. Maelstrom attempts to threaten Quasar into giving up the gift, but Quasar rightfully notes that there’s nothing more Maelstrom can do to harm him. Maelstrom sadly agrees and then quantum-jumps to high earth orbit; Quasar follows.</p><p>Maelstrom uses his mastery of kinetic energy to halt the Earth’s rotation, which would hypothetically wipe out all life on the planet within minutes. He then offers Quasar a choice. He will free Earth if Quasar gives him the secrets of cosmic awareness. Quasar realizes that Maelstrom would only wreak even more devastation across the universe. Unable to make the decision to sacrifice the Earth for the greater good of the universe, Quasar retreats into the Quantum-zone. Maelstrom summons Deathurge after dispatching Kid Reaper and explains that he had already stolen cosmic awareness from Eon when Quasar killed him; he just wanted Quasar to give his up. Maelstrom then notes that they are being watched by Earth’s <a href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\">Watcher</a>, Uatu. The Watcher pleads with them to stop their reign of destruction. Maelstrom directs Deathurge to cut out the Watcher’s eyes, but the Watcher vanishes.</p><p><a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange </a>and a cadre of other mystics manage to keep the side-effects of rotation being stopped from doing much damage.</p><p>Quasar flying through the <a href=\"/quantum-zone/4020-44748/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44748\">Quantum-Zone</a> to regroup discovers his true benefactor allowing him to continue to exist beyond death. <a href=\"/infinity/4005-11333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11333\">Infinity</a>. She makes Quasar her Avatar and explains that Maelstrom has created a large black hole that will continue to grow until it completely encompasses the entire universe, leaving him as its single anomalous ruler.</p><p>Quasar returns to normal space and attempts to replace the matter and energy with the power Infinity has lent him as it is taken by the black hole. Maelstrom senses this and attacks him; Quasar maneuvers them into the event horizon of the black hole, destroying Maelstrom. Quasar then realizes his previous attempt would not be enough and throws himself into the maw of the black hole and attempts to release all the power at his disposal which could start a reaction that might reverse the flow of the black hole. However he is shunted to <a href=\"/oblivion/4005-2496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2496\">Oblivion</a>’s realm, he is greeted by Oblivion and his new Avatar, Maelstrom.</p><p>Maelstrom is quickly augmented by Oblivion, and Maelstrom declares that they will thrash the Infinity-force out of him. It is then that Infinity makes her presence known she augments Quasar so that he and Maelstrom are on even terms; Oblivion tells her that it is time that a new deal is struck between the forces of life and death. Infinity regretfully agrees.</p><p>The battle is met and they find that they are indeed too evenly matched, which means that there is no one to stop the black hole. Finally after several minutes Quasar realizes that his retroactively changed costume makes him more of an anomaly than Maelstrom, this minor fact throws off Maelstrom’s concentration and he is destroyed by the Quantum-bands, causing a chain reaction which causes the black hole to reverse itself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060347-107289_186008_quasar_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060347\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.6166666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:161.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060347-107289_186008_quasar_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060347\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060347-107289_186008_quasar_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060347-107289_186008_quasar_super.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060347-107289_186008_quasar_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2355/1060347-107289_186008_quasar_super.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p><a href=\"/eternity/4005-11332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11332\">Eternity</a> and <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a> arrive on the scene to strike a new deal with their siblings; Quasar unable to glean a single word of the conversation returns to Earth.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>After creating a group known as the Aesir; mainly to combat vigilant heroes, Avatarr decided to also build the floating city known as Valhalla to house the Aesir. But soon afterwards Jordan Boone and the man-beast Ravage investigated Valhalla, with Ravage discovering a considerable weakness in the engines; which maintained the city afloat.(Anti gravity engines which allowed the city to remain in the sky) However Boone became more interested in becoming a superhuman to keep up with his friend, Meanstreak. Boone soon found a way to trick his way in to the Aesir program and influence them to eventually make him become the 2099s Loki, while Ravage joined both the X-Men and Doom. Soon afterwards X-Men and Doom fought with the Aesir, resulting in the death of Heimdell with the help of Loki. Doom then began to battle 2099s Thor. This battle eventually led to a great explosion, separating both Thor and Doom. Although, both soon regrouped separately, with Avatarr reminding Thor of his mortality, while Doom joined 2099s Spider-man, Punisher and Ravage. Doom's group eventually took control of Valhalla, when soon afterwards the engines maintaining the city afloat began to malfunction and caused the city to collapse upon New York. During this time the X-Men gathered the workers at Valhalla and brought them to safety. However after Punisher used Thor's recognition as Jake Gallows, the team of 2099 heroes threw Thor's hammer in to the engines causing the engines to begin stabilizing and work again once more. In the end, Doom claimed Valhalla for himself and was made a province of Latveria. The majority of Aesir perished in battle, with Loki and Hela being some of the few to survive.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/x-men-2099-volume-1/4000-164342/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-164342\">X-Men 2099 vol. 1</a> <i>(only includes part 3)</i></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/blockbusters-of-the-marvel-universe/4050-38679/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38679\">Blockbusters of the Marvel Universe</a></li></ul><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/3601079-fall_of_the_hammer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3601079\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.29625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:29.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/3601079-fall_of_the_hammer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3601079\"><img alt=\"All five covers merged\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67663/3601079-fall_of_the_hammer.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/3601079-fall_of_the_hammer.jpg 7200w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67663/3601079-fall_of_the_hammer.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/3601079-fall_of_the_hammer.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>All five covers merged</figcaption></figure><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>The story arc is entitled <b>“The Night Gwen Stacy Died”</b> and it was written by Gerry Conway, penciled by Gil Kane, and inked by John Romita Sr. It also featured Tony Mortellaro penciling the fight scene between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. It was a two-issue story in The Amazing Spider-Man issues #121 and #122.</p><h2>Plot (Contains Spoilers)</h2><p>Harry Osborn had become a drug addict and his father secluded him to the Osborn mansion so this does not go public and possibly ruin Norman. When Peter, Gwen, and Mary Jane go to visit Harry who is still ill due to his drug addiction, Norman blamed the three of them for Harry’s condition. Norman had lost his memories of the Green Goblin and the identity of Spider-Man due to amnesia. Later Norman would soon discover that he was going to face financial ruins anyways. This caused him to suffer a breakdown, which results in him unlocking the lost memories. Norman remembers the Green Goblin and the identity of Spider-Man again. He becomes obsessed over making Spider-Man pay for ruining his life and Harry’s life. Norman would use Spider-Man’s identity to his advantage by abducting the girlfriend of Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy. He was able to kidnap Gwen and took her hostage to lure Spider-Man to him. Goblin lures Spider-Man to the Brooklyn Bridge, where the two began to fight. While they fought each other, Gwen is unconscious the whole time. Spider-Man seemed to have the upper hand in the fight, until Goblin grabs Gwen and throws her off the bridge. Spider-Man frantically shoots his webbing to catch and he does. Upon catching her though was a “snap” sound effect next to her neck. After Spider-Man reels her back up to the bridge, he realizes that she is dead. Whether Gwen died because of whiplash or if the Goblin had already killed her to begin with was never explained. Spider-Man still blames himself for Gwen’s death and swears revenge against the Green Goblin. Spider-Man starts looking for the Green Goblin soon and was able to track him down to a warehouse. Spider-Man proceeds to beating Norman to near death, but he tells himself he can’t kill him. While Spider-Man hesitated, Goblin remote controlled his glider to try and impale Spider-Man from behind. Spider-Man is alerted by his Spider-Sense that enabled him to jump out of the glider’s path right before it hit him. The glider continues to go towards Goblin which stabs him and kills him instead. Peter is finally at home when he is confronted by Mary Jane, at first Peter thought Mary Jane would not know how he feels because she is a “party girl,” but when MJ cried, that was the first time the two connected so deeply.</p><h2>Movie Adaption</h2><p>In the movie Spider-Man (2002), it adapted itself to this story arc. The Green Goblin had found out Spider-Man’s secret identity and planned to make him suffer. The Green Goblin kidnaps not Gwen, but Mary Jane Watson since Gwen was not introduced in this movie. Mary Jane was kidnapped by the Green Goblin. The differences are that he took her hostage at Queensboro Bridge. Mary Jane is conscious unlike Gwen in the comics, but she was tossed off the bridge like Gwen. Spider-Man catches Mary Jane and she was able to survive. One of the big similarities in the movie adaptation was when the Green Goblin and Spider-Man fought in the abandoned warehouse. Peter could not come to kill the Green Goblin and was nearly stabbed in the back by the glider, but his Spider-Sense alerted him in time to jump out of the glider’s way and ended up stabbing Norman himself, killing him.</p><h2>Animated Adaption</h2><p>In the Spider-Man animated series (1994-1998) in the episode Turning Point the Green Goblin finds out Spider-Man's secret identity using a portal device called the time dilation accelerator which he had previously stolen from the Kingpin. Using this knowledge to his advantage the Goblin encourages his son Harry to invite Peter to his birthday party (the Peter-Harry relationship being strained during that time). At the party the Goblin psychologically tortures Peter, constantly implying that he will reveal his identity to the party goers. After Peter creates a distraction by throwing his web cartridges into the fire place causing the mansion to catch fire Norman uses the opportunity to change into his Green Goblin garb and engages Peter in the backyard. The Goblin manages to stun Spider-Man and drag him off at the back of his goblin glider to the Brooklyn Bridge. At the bridge Peter is able to free himself and change into his Spider-Man costume which was hidden under his clothes. After a brief battle, the Goblin decides that he hasn't made Spider-Man suffer enough and uses the accelerator to teleport to Spider-Man's house with the intent of kidnapping his Aunt May. Spider-Man races back to his house only to find his aunt sleeping peacefully. The Goblin then appears and tells Spider-Man that he would rather pay a visit to his other \"co-conspirator.\" The Goblin then vanishes through a portal. Due to a comment Osborn previously made at the party Spider-Man recognizes that the Goblin was talking about Mary Jane. Spider-Man races to her home but he is too late, the Goblin got there first and was now bringing her to the bridge. Spider-Man follows the Goblin to the bridge where a climactic battle begins between the two foes. During a pause in the fight the Goblin remote controls his glider to fire a missile at Spider-Man and Mary Jane. The blast accidently sets off the accelerator creating a portal on the side of the bridge. The blast also separates Spider-Man and Mary Jane who falls off the bridge and into the aforementioned portal which then closes shut. Spider-Man looks over the bridge but can't see Mary Jane's body. He dives into the river to look for her. Meanwhile the Goblin finds the accelerator and mounts back on his glider. The search for Mary Jane's body ends in vain and Spider-Man rises from the water with nothing but vengeance on his mind. Believing Mary Jane dead and vowing to make the Goblin pay Spider-Man engages him once more. Stunned by the webslinger's anger the Goblin attempts to retreat by creating a portal but the accelerator was presumably damaged when the Goblin attempted to blast Spider-Man. The portal begins to suck everything into it, including the Goblin himself. Barely able to hang on the Goblin reverts back to his Norman Osborn personality and begs Spider-Man to help him. At first Spider-Man refuses, but then realizes that revenge is never justified and that nothing will bring Mary Jane back. Spider-Man attempts to help Norman (Spidey is able to resist the pull of the vortex because he can stick to the ground), however he once again reverts back to his Goblin persona and remote controls his glider to hit Spider-Man from behind which would send them both into the vortex. Thanks to his spider-sense Spider-Man dodges the glider and it hits the Goblin in the chest sending him into the portal and destroying the accelerator. The portal then closes shut. A broken Spider-Man is left alone to contemplate what had just happened.</p><p>The presence of a portal device in the story was used by the writers as a substitute for death, as they were not allowed to kill people on Saturday mornings. As Gwen Stacy had not yet been introduced into the show, Mary Jane served as her replacement. It is notable that the real Mary Jane never again appears in the series after this episode.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/spider-man-death-of-the-stacys/4050-33398/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33398\">Spider-Man: Death of the Stacys</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-100-greatest-marvels-of-all-time-21-18/4000-133634/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-133634\">The 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time #2</a>'</li><li><a href=\"/the-100-greatest-marvels-of-all-time-9-6/4000-133637/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-133637\">The 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time #5</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-masterworks-the-amazing-spider-man-volume-thirteen/4000-264614/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-264614\">Marvel Masterworks: The Amazing Spider-Man #13: Volume Thirteen</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-through-the-decades/4050-44692/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-44692\">The Amazing Spider-Man: Through the Decades</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-tales-the-night-gwen-stacy-died/4000-19047/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-19047\">Marvel Tales #98</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-tales-the-goblins-last-stand/4000-64836/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-64836\">Marvel Tales #99</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-tales-the-goblins-last-stand/4000-64956/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-64956\">Marvel Tales #192</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/what-if-what-if-spider-man-had-rescued-gwen-stacy/4000-20883/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-20883\">What If? #24</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spiderman-los-imprescindibles-6/4000-295856/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-295856\">Spiderman: Los Imprescindibles #6</a> (Spain)</p></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Regarded as the greatest Kraven-story ever told, and one of the best Spider-man stories.",
    "description": "<p>There was a time when the world marveled at his physical prowess. A period when his courage inspired awe and his exploits drew envy. An interval when he truly was the world's greatest hunter. That was before the environmentalists deserted him, and the animal rights activists condemned him. It was before he met <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>. Before he knew failure and humiliation. Sergei Kravinov was aware that death was coming. He could sense its stealthy approach and could almost see it grinning in the shadows. But Kraven wasn't ready to die. He couldn't rest until he had reclaimed his honor and dignity. Until he had satiated his pride and proven his superiority. Until he had defeated Spider-Man. And so, gathering his strength, Kraven went out on one last hunt...</p><h2>Fading Powers</h2><p>Kraven was still faster than a panther and stronger that a great ape, but he knew that he was no longer in his prime. Yet he believed that he would never know peace unless he humbled Spider-Man. Formulating a daring plan, he sought to immerse himself in Spider-Man's essence by burying his body within a veritable mountain of spiders and by using jungle herbs and potions to expand his consciousness.</p><h2>The Capture</h2><p>Having recently returned home from his honeymoon, and thinking about death all around him after going to a crook's funeral, Spider-Man was out web-swinging one night when he was suddenly attacked , drugged and captured by Kraven. As the hunter advanced on his prey, Spider-Man was unconcerned. Until, that is, he saw the rifle and the look in Kraven's eyes. Aiming the rifle at Spider-Man, Kraven shot the wall-crawler right between the eyes.</p><h2>Masquerade</h2><p>Kraven took the wall-crawler's body back to his estate, placed him in a coffin, and buried him on the grounds. But it wasn't enough for Kraven to merely slay Spider-Man. The hunter had to prove his superiority. He had to become his enemy. So, dressing up in a duplicate costume, Kraven assumed Spider-Man's identity.</p><h2>New Justice</h2><p>Kraven began to patrol the city, dispensing his own vicious brand of justice. He even rescued <a href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane</a> from muggers, but she immediately saw through the disguise. Unlike Spider-Man, Kraven actually killed some of the criminals he came across.</p><h2>The Battle</h2><p>While Kraven focused on Spider-Man, a ratlike monster stalked the streets of Manhattan. He was called <a href=\"/vermin/4005-6818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6818\">Vermin</a>, and he possessed superhuman strength, speed, and stamina. Kraven used his skills to track the monster through the sewers. Dressed like Spider-Man, Kraven confronted Vermin, beat him unconscious, and took him prisoner.</p><h2>Resurrection</h2><p>As Kraven claimed victory over Vermin, the real Spider-Man stirred...he had only been drugged by Kraven. Buried deep in the ground, Peter Parker opened his eyes. Desperate to be united with Mary Jane, he broke his way out of the coffin and began to crawl upward, clawing his way to the surface. Two weeks had passed since Kraven had buried him alive. After a brief visit to assure his wife that he was still alive, Spider-Man began to hunt the hunter.</p><h2>Compassion, Not Vengeance</h2><p>Through sheer brutality, Kraven had battered Vermin into submission. He took the monster into custody because he wanted to see if Spider-Man was powerful enough to do the same. But the web-swinger had nothing to prove. He didn't care what the hunter thought and no desire to inflict pain.</p><h2>Blood and Thunder</h2><p>Filled with fury, Spider-Man attacked Kraven, who didn't bother to resist. The hunter merely smiled... he had won. He had allowed Spider-Man to live when he could have easily killed him. Kraven had finally proven himself superior to Spider-Man. When the wall-crawler refused Kraven's challenge to fight Vermin, the monster attacked him. Kraven immediately acted to save his old enemy, but released Vermin. Having achieved what he set out to do, Kraven allowed Spider-Man to pursue Vermin. The hunter then committed suicide.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/spider-man-kravens-last-hunt/4050-28024/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28024\">Spider-Man: Kraven's Last Hunt</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/what-if-what-if-kraven-the-hunter-had-killed-spiderman/4000-33214/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-33214\">What If...? #17</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spiderman-los-imprescindibles-3-la-ultima-caceria-/4000-295853/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-295853\">Spiderman: Los Imprescindibles #3</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

Emma, who was not ready for the X-Men at the time refused and Xavier and Vulcan left her with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\" href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" slug=\"hellfire-club\">Hellfire Club</a>. While leaving Xavier erased her memory of the encounter. With little time to spare, Xavier used his telepathy to train the team psychically, allowing them to train in the use of their powers in their minds. The duration of this training felt like it was extended, while only lasting a period of hours in the real world.</p><p>When the team, led by Vulcan, was sent to Krakoa to rescue the original X-Men they were quickly subdued by the island. Vulcan was able to survive by absorbing the powers of his teammates, buried deep in the island. When the island was shot into space by the second rescue team, Vulcan remained on it in stasis, kept alive by Darwin's powers. Because of the X-Men's heavy emotions over what had occurred Xavier used his telepathic powers to erase the memories of everyone involved, leaving no trace of recollection of the original team.</p><h2>Xavier's Shame</h2><p>After the events of the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\" href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" slug=\"house-of-m\">House of M</a>, 90% of the world's mutants were de-powered by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\" href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" slug=\"scarlet-witch\">Scarlet Witch</a>. This surge of power released into the universe when the so many mutants lost their powers caused Vulcan to stir, still inside of the island which was orbiting the Earth. Realizing what had occurred Vulcan felt betrayed by Xavier. Wanting to make Xavier pay for his deception Vulcan sought to drive Xavier out (who Vulcan did not know had not been seen since <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\" href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" slug=\"m-day\">M-Day</a>). Vulcan, whose powers are now at <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42826\" href=\"/omega-level-mutant/4015-42826/\" slug=\"omega-level-mutant\">Omega-level mutant</a>, first killed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9708\" href=\"/banshee/4005-9708/\" slug=\"banshee\">Banshee</a> by hitting him with a plane. He drew <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a> into a cave with the image of their beloved <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a>, and quickly bested them in combat. Vulcan captured Cyclops and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\" href=\"/marvel-girl/4005-3566/\" slug=\"marvel-girl\">Marvel Girl</a> and imprisoned them in the facility where Vulcans team originally trained with Cyclops. After barely escaping, Vulcan confronted the team, including Xavier, about what happened. Professor X, who had lost his powers on M-Day could not show the team what had actually transpired as Vulcan demanded. Rachel used her telepathic abilities to link the minds of the X-Men with the Professor so that he could show them what actually happened.</p><p>The team attacks Vulcan for killing Banshee, but Vulcan escaped into outer space. Vulcan, who had spent his childhood imprisoned by the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43138\" href=\"/shiar/4015-43138/\" slug=\"shiar\">Shi'ar</a> as a slave, left for Shi'ar space to make them pay for killing his mother and for his difficult childhood. Horrified by the betrayal against both teams of X-Men, Cyclops tells Xavier that as a human he is no longer welcome at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" slug=\"xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>.</p><h2>Suggest Reading</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4050-2763\" href=\"/giant-size-x-men/4050-2763/\" slug=\"giant-size-x-men\">Giant-Size X-Men</a> #1</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4050-18091\" href=\"/x-men-deadly-genesis/4050-18091/\" slug=\"x-men-deadly-genesis\">X-Men: Deadly Genesis</a> #1-6</p><h2>Related Storylines</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\" href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" slug=\"house-of-m\">House of M</a> - The events of the Deadly Genesis are preceded by the House of M, although other than the link mentioned there is no real relationship between the stories.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"43521\" href=\"/rise-and-fall-of-the-shiar-empire/43521/\" slug=\"rise-and-fall-of-the-shiar-empire\">Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire</a> - The events that occur directly after the Deadly Genesis storyline, beginning with Vulcan heading into Shi'ar space to exact his revenge.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-28607\" href=\"/x-men-deadly-genesis/4050-28607/\" slug=\"x-men-deadly-genesis\">X-Men: Deadly Genesis</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4045-43520\" href=\"/deadly-genesis/4045-43520/marvel-encyclopedia/49-18366/\" slug=\"deadly-genesis\">Marvel Encyclopedia #0</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-18511\" href=\"/what-if-x-men-deadly-genesis/4050-18511/\" slug=\"what-if-x-men-deadly-genesis\">What If? - X-Men: Deadly Genesis</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-25193\" href=\"/x-men-messiah-complex-mutant-files/4050-25193/\" slug=\"x-men-messiah-complex-mutant-files\">X-Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files</a></li></ul><h2>Non U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-283997\" href=\"/astonishing-x-men-/4000-283997/\" slug=\"astonishing-x-men-\">Astonishing X-Men #16</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-283998\" href=\"/astonishing-x-men-/4000-283998/\" slug=\"astonishing-x-men-\">Astonishing X-Men #17</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-283999\" href=\"/astonishing-x-men-/4000-283999/\" slug=\"astonishing-x-men-\">Astonishing X-Men #18</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284000\" href=\"/astonishing-x-men-/4000-284000/\" slug=\"astonishing-x-men-\">Astonishing X-Men #19</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284001\" href=\"/astonishing-x-men-/4000-284001/\" slug=\"astonishing-x-men-\">Astonishing X-Men #20</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284002\" href=\"/astonishing-x-men-/4000-284002/\" slug=\"astonishing-x-men-\">Astonishing X-Men #21</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-264524\" href=\"/essential-x-men-deadly-genesis/4000-264524/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-deadly-genesis\">Essential X-Men #171</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-264517\" href=\"/essential-x-men-death-of-an-x-man/4000-264517/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-death-of-an-x-man\">Essential X-Men #172</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-291761\" href=\"/marvel-exklusiv-/4000-291761/\" slug=\"marvel-exklusiv-\">Marvel Exklusiv #63</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-299663\" href=\"/x-men-genesis-mortal-/4000-299663/\" slug=\"x-men-genesis-mortal-\">X-Men: Génesis Mortal #1</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-299664\" href=\"/x-men-genesis-mortal-/4000-299664/\" slug=\"x-men-genesis-mortal-\">X-Men: Génesis Mortal #2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-299665\" href=\"/x-men-genesis-mortal-/4000-299665/\" slug=\"x-men-genesis-mortal-\">X-Men: Génesis Mortal #3</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-299666\" href=\"/x-men-genesis-mortal-/4000-299666/\" slug=\"x-men-genesis-mortal-\">X-Men: Génesis Mortal #4</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-299667\" href=\"/x-men-genesis-mortal-/4000-299667/\" slug=\"x-men-genesis-mortal-\">X-Men: Génesis Mortal #5</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-299668\" href=\"/x-men-genesis-mortal-/4000-299668/\" slug=\"x-men-genesis-mortal-\">X-Men: Génesis Mortal #6</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-299669\" href=\"/x-men-genesis-mortal-/4000-299669/\" slug=\"x-men-genesis-mortal-\">X-Men: Génesis Mortal #7</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Background</h2><p>When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7591\" href=\"/corsair/4005-7591/\" slug=\"corsair\">Corsair</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15328\" href=\"/katherine-summers/4005-15328/\" slug=\"katherine-summers\">Katherine Summers</a> Summers were kidnapped by the <a data-ref-id=\"43138\" href=\"/shiar/43138/\" slug=\"shiar\">Shi'ar</a> Katherine Ann was pregnant with her third child. When Christopher (eventually to become the pirate Corsair) made an unsuccessful attempt at escape, Katherine was killed and her unborn child was ripped from her womb as a punishment for disobedience. Christopher was sent off into slavery, and it was believed that the child died with her. Instead, it was kept alive and incubated by Shi'ar technology in order to make him a slave. The child Gabriel would eventually escape life as a slave and make its way to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" slug=\"professor-x\">Professor X</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\" href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" slug=\"moira-mactaggert\">Moira MacTaggert</a>. Gabriel was a mutant like his older brothers Scott ( <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a>) and Alexander ( <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\" href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" slug=\"havok\">Havok</a>) with the power to manipulate energy. He joined a team of mutants that Moira was training in the safe use of their powers in much the same way that Professor Xavier trained the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" slug=\"x-men\">X-Men</a> (although for a different purpose than the X-Men). Gabriel was even able to meet and train with his older brother Cyclops.</p><p>When the X-Men were sent to the remote pacific island <a data-ref-id=\"4005-26409\" href=\"/krakoa/4005-26409/\" slug=\"krakoa\">Krakoa</a> to investigate a mutant signal, they were quickly subdued by the island itself to use as a source of sustenance. Professor Xavier recruited Moira's team for a rescue effort. Xavier used his telepathic abilities to train the team psychically in the use of their powers. While much more prepared in the use of their abilities, the team was inexperienced in the field and also taken by the island. Of his teammates only Vulcan survived by absorbing his comrades' powers and tunneling deep into the island. Xavier recruited a second rescue team of X-Men consisting of older mutants from around the globe, and this time met with ultimate success sending the island into space. While the original team was alive and well, losing the first rescue team of X-Men took its toll on the members, particularly Cyclops because of the loss of his younger brother. In an attempt to fix his mistake Xavier removed the memory of the first team from everyone's minds. After the events of the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\" href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" slug=\"house-of-m\">House of M</a> most of the world's mutants were de-powered. This sudden surge of power traveling back into the Universe caused Vulcan to awaken. Angered at Xavier's betrayal, Vulcan killed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9708\" href=\"/banshee/4005-9708/\" slug=\"banshee\">Banshee</a> to draw out the X-Men and forced Xavier to show the team what actually happened. When the X-Men attacked Vulcan for killing Banshee Vulcan fled into space on a course for the Shi'ar empire to make them pay for enslaving him and killing his mother.</p><p>Vulcan's teammate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40600\" href=\"/darwin/4005-40600/\" slug=\"darwin\">Darwin</a>'s abilities included the ability to adapt to any scenario. When Vulcan awoke, the ambient energies of Darwin came with him. Separated from Vulcan on Earth, Darwin's life energy began to evolve him a new body. Eventually Darwin regained consciousness at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" slug=\"xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> and learned of what had happened to his team and Vulcan.</p><p>For further reading see: <a data-ref-id=\"4045-43520\" href=\"/deadly-genesis/4045-43520/\" slug=\"deadly-genesis\">Deadly Genesis</a></p><h2>Journey to the Shi'ar Empire</h2><p>Although Xavier is no longer welcome at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" slug=\"xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>, he understands that whether Vulcan succeeds or fails in his quest for revenge, the outcome would be terrible.

He is also powerless, and depressed. Where once he lived his life permanently in the fast lane, he now finds himself as slow as any normal human. With nowhere to go Pietro travels to the moon to visit his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\" href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" slug=\"inhumans\">Inhumans</a> wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\" href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" slug=\"crystal\">Crystal</a> and their daughter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10962\" href=\"/luna/4005-10962/\" slug=\"luna\">Luna</a>. While he is there he hatches a plan to regain his lost abilities and more with the Inhuman's sacred <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40921\" href=\"/terrigen-mists/4055-40921/\" slug=\"terrigen-mists\">Terrigen Mists</a>. After acquiring the mists, he finds himself re-powered, but not how he used to be. He can now hyper-accelerate every aspect of his body so that he could now travel through time. With the Terrigen Crystals in hand he travels back to Earth with his daughter and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3534\" href=\"/lockjaw/4005-3534/\" slug=\"lockjaw\">Lockjaw</a>. Back on Earth he dangerously exposes himself and his daughter (who the Inhuman high council did not believe it was safe to go through the process of <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42287\" href=\"/terrigenesis/4015-42287/\" slug=\"terrigenesis\">Terrigenesis</a> as she is half human) to the mists multiple times.</p> <p>Later, Quicksilver travels to the now broken island nation of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\" href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" slug=\"genosha\">Genosha</a> where he offers to re-power several of the de-powered mutants that were living there. The process, however, is not meant for humans and proves fatal to at least one of the mutants exposed. Others were trapped or haunted by their powers rather than living freely again as they had hoped. After a mutant that carried the powers of all the de-powered mutants came to Genosha to re-power <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\" href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" slug=\"magneto\">Magneto</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" slug=\"shield\">SHIELD</a> took the crystals that generated the mists, leaving Quicksilver with only a small portion of them. The Inhuman leader <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\" href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" slug=\"black-bolt\">Black Bolt</a> came to Gensoha at the same time to request the return of the mists to their rightful place. SHIELD, understanding what a powerful weapon they may have in the Terrigen Mists, announced that they were now the property of the United States government. The Inhumans announce that this is a declaration of war upon them, and that they will act upon the situation. By stealing the Mists from them, the Inhumans believe that the first shot in a war has been fired. As the Mists are the cornerstone of their tradition and civilization, they will do anything they have to in order to restore the mists.<br/></p> <p>For further reading see: <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\" href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" slug=\"house-of-m\">House of M</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4045-43600\" href=\"/son-of-m/4045-43600/\" slug=\"son-of-m\">Son of M</a></p><a href=\"///\"></a> <h2>Related Story arcs</h2> <p><a data-ref-id=\"4045-43600\" href=\"/son-of-m/4045-43600/\" slug=\"son-of-m\">Son of M</a> - The events of Son of M set the stage for the Silent War. </p><h2>Collected Editions </h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-33155\" href=\"/silent-war/4050-33155/\" slug=\"silent-war\">Silent War</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions </h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-292311\" href=\"/marvel-universe-/4000-292311/\" slug=\"marvel-universe-\">Marvel Universe #6</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>When <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a> began a romantic relationship with <a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a>, she would constantly talk to <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> about it. While lounging around the swimming pool, a drunk Wasp accidentally slips and reveals to Wanda that she once had children and that this fact was hidden from her by her teacher, <a href=\"/agatha-harkness/4005-3327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3327\">Agatha Harkness</a>. After confirming the truth of the story, that her children were not real and were actually willed into being, Wanda becomes enraged. Her initial acts are subtle at first, but become terrifying and result in the destruction of the Avengers team as a whole. An attack by the recently deceased <a href=\"/jack-of-hearts/4005-7213/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7213\">Jack Of Hearts</a> - who walks into the Avengers Mansion gates and explodes, killing Scott Lang - is followed by <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> giving an embarrassing, drunken, enraged speech to the UN in which he shouts and rants to the Latverian delegate about how he should just kill him. <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">The Vision</a> then slams a <a href=\"/avengers-quinjet/4055-53156/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-53156\">Quinjet</a> into the already battered Avengers mansion before dropping several large, silver orbs from his mouth which proceed to form into copies of the Avengers long-time enemy <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a>, which attack the team. Unprovoked, <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a> now becomes more and more enraged and grabs the Vision and rips him in half, and proceeds to attack her startled friends. The culmination of events is the sudden, inexplicable arrival of a fleet of Kree warships who attack the assembled heroes. Hawkeye dies when he sacrifices himself to save his friends and gets sucked into a warship's air intake, causing it to explode. The remaining Kree troops around the ground dematerialize as quickly as they had at first come, and the smaller attack ships flee the scene. <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a> finally appears on the scene to ask which powerful being could possibly be causing these horrific things. The group and Strange deduce that the Scarlet Witch is behind the events due to the loss of her children, and fly to apprehend her. When Strange confronts and uses the All-Seeing Eye of <a href=\"/agamotto/4005-21584/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21584\">Agamotto</a> to show her the truth of what she has unwittingly caused, Wanda falls to the ground and her creations fade away. <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>, <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a> and the mutants that made up <a href=\"/excalibur/4060-14864/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14864\">Excalibur</a> are in <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a>, trying to rebuild after the most recent destruction of the small nation, hear about the destruction caused by Magneto's daughter. Magneto travels to the Avengers and takes his daughter away back to Genosha. He seals her in his home in hopes of protecting her from the outside world, repairing her shattered mind and nursing her back to health. The tragic events shock the Avengers so much that they decide to disperse and the team is effectively ended.</p><p>This story arc is one of <i>the</i> most controversial of any Avengers storyline, leading to the deaths of three major characters: Hawkeye, Vision and Scott Lang and the temporary end of the Avengers, who would reform in the title <a href=\"/the-new-avengers/4050-11497/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11497\">New Avengers</a> (actually only a month later in real comics terms). Under the creative direction of <a href=\"/brian-michael-bendis/4040-40435/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40435\">Brian Bendis</a>, among others, Disassembled was used to shift the tone and reset the Avengers franchise for years to come.</p><p>Accompanying stories were written in other major Marvel titles at the time which also concluded their runs. In the pages of <a href=\"/thor/4050-6226/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-6226\">Thor</a>, Thor battles to stop the cycle of death and rebirth called Ragnarok, set off this time by Loki. The conclusion sees Thor enter a period of hibernation. Thor ceased to feature with the main Avengers team until his return to the group in 2010 with the relaunch of <a href=\"/the-avengers/4050-33227/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33227\">Avengers</a>. In <a href=\"/iron-man/4050-6504/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-6504\">Iron Man</a>, Tony Stark encounters a terrorist weapons developer who steals a suit of Iron Man armor. In <a href=\"/captain-america/4050-9088/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9088\">Captain America</a>, Steve Rogers discovers that his wartime partner Bucky Barnes was not in fact dead, but is still alive as the Russian agent: Winter Soldier.</p><h2>Crossover Characters</h2><p><a href=\"/agatha-harkness/4005-3327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3327\">Agatha Harkness</a>, <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a>, <a href=\"/black-knight/4005-3172/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3172\">Black Knight</a>, <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a>, <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a>, <a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a>, <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href=\"/dum-dum-dugan/4005-3526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Dum Dum Dugan</a>, <a href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\">Falcon</a>, <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a>(YellowJacket), <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>, <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> (as a manifestation of the Scarlet Witch's power), <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a>, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>, <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a>, <a href=\"/jack-of-hearts/4005-7213/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7213\">Jack Of Hearts</a>, <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>, <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Jarvis</a>, <a href=\"/jocasta/4005-3318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3318\">Jocasta</a>, <a href=\"/justice/4005-4811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4811\">Justice</a>, <a href=\"/lionheart/4005-41206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41206\">Lionheart</a>, <a href=\"/moon-knight/4005-1493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1493\">Moon Knight</a>, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Ms. Marvel</a>, <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a>, <a href=\"/photon/4005-11337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11337\">Photon</a>, <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a> (as a manifestation of the Scarlet Witch's power), <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a>, <a href=\"/scott-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Scott Lang</a> ( <a href=\"/ant-man/4005-6774/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6774\">Ant-Man</a>), <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>, <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> (most likely a manifestation of the Scarlet Witch's power), <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> (as a manifestation of the Scarlet Witch's power), <a href=\"/sentry/4005-1454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\">Sentry</a>, <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a>, <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"/spider-woman/4005-1453/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1453\">Spider-Woman</a>, <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a>, <a href=\"/tigra/4005-21188/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21188\">Tigra</a>, <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> (most likely a manifestation of the Scarlet Witch's power), <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a>, <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> (as a manifestation of the Scarlet Witch's power), <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a>.</p><h2>Related Story-Arcs</h2><p><a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a> - After the destruction of the Avengers, Wanda was coerced by her brother <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> into manipulating reality to create a world where mutants ruled the earth and humankind was hated by the mutant majority.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a> ended the same way it began. With a flash of white light the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> used her power to alter reality. The first time she was coerced by her brother Pietro (<a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a>) and created a world where <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">Mutant</a>s were dominant and ordinary humans lived in fear of persecution, giving rise to the House of M. The second time she uttered the words: \"No more mutants\", and with the flash of white the world she created reverted back to what it was before... almost. In that instant the mutant population was instantly reduced from millions to thousands, the majority suddenly realizing that they were powerless. These millions of former mutants are changed, reduced to normal humans in every way down to their DNA. The Scarlet Witch has completely erased the <a href=\"/x-gene/4015-42328/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42328\">X-Gene</a> from their genetic code. Those few that remembered the events of the House of M were those that were touched by the powers of <a href=\"/layla-miller/4005-1447/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1447\">Layla Miller</a> during the House of M, revealing that the reality that the Scarlet Witch had created was not how things should be.</p><p>Because virtually none of the population was aware of what had actually occurred, the sudden de-powering of almost all mutants was met with varying reactions. The day with which the mutants were de-powered is alternatively referred to as <a href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\">M-Day</a> or the Decimation. The term Decimation also became synonymous with the reduction of the mutant population due to the large reduction in their total numbers. In terms of the story-arch, the Decimation is the events that occur directly after the House of M that chronicle the fallout of the massive event. It spans several different comic book series, and is comprised of several different story-archs that are related in origin.</p><h2>198</h2><p>During the Decimation things became quite difficult for mutants, powered and de-powered alike. Now that their numbers were no where near as strong as they were before, human gangs began to violently attack many of the remaining mutants. Because of the hostilities, Cyclops offered the use of the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> as a sanctuary to any mutant in the world regardless of their history. Mutants friend, foe, and relatively unknown came to the mansion hoping for safety against the dangerous outside world. The mutants that camped out on the school grounds began referring to themselves as the <a href=\"/198/4060-40592/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40592\">198</a>. While this number did not accurately reflect the number of mutants left (or the number of mutants in the group), 198 was the earliest confirmed number of mutants still powered after M-Day.</p><p>Tensions grew at the mansion as the 198 began to feel more like prisoners than guests. The Office of National Emergency (<a href=\"/one/4060-40667/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40667\">ONE</a>) had deployed their <a href=\"/sentinel-squad-one/4060-41743/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41743\">Sentinel Squad ONE</a> at the mansion as a protective measure, keeping the mutants safe from outside threat. To do so they also were authorized in the use of force to keep the 198 from leaving the school grounds. Only the secretive <a href=\"/mr-m/4005-40602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40602\">Mr. M</a> seemed to have the power to stop the Sentinels, which he demonstrated at one point by hurling two sentinels out of the way to prevent one of them from stepping on a butterfly. Seeing what awesome power Mr. M possessed, ONE determined that he was a threat and needed to be dealt with. After much tension and pushing from both sides the 198, under the leadership of Mr. M, left the school grounds with the intention of creating their own island settlement under their own protection and governance. The sentinels were powerless to stop him, but ONE had a foothold within the group. The mutant <a href=\"/johnny-dee/4005-40785/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40785\">Johnny Dee</a> had used his power over the duration of his stay with the 198 to create voodoo doll replicas of many prominent members of the group. With these dolls he could control the actions of those individuals. Taking control of leech and magma he was able to neutralize Mr. M's powers, and destroy him in a rush of molten lava.</p><p>For more information see the <a href=\"/198/4060-40592/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40592\">198</a>.</p><h2>Son of M</h2><p><a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> (Quicksilver) is de-powered after the <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a>. It seems to be a fitting punishment after convincing his sister to create the House of M. Formerly living life permanently in the fast lane, Pietro is now forced to live his life at the painfully slow pace of a normal human. Pietro travels to the Moon to visit his <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a> wife and daughter, <a href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a> and <a href=\"/luna/4005-10962/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10962\">Luna</a>. While in the Inhuman city on the Moon, Pietro is given the idea to re-power himself with the Inhuman <a href=\"/terrigen-mists/4055-40921/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40921\">Terrigen Mists</a>. After exposing himself to the mists, Pietro believes that nothing has happened. He is confronted by a disheveled, future version of himself who tells him that the mists have not only given him back speed, but have given him the ability to jump through time by vibrating his body at high rates of speed. He hatches a plan to steal the crystals that generate the mists and take them back to Earth.</p><p>On Earth Pietro exposes himself and his daughter. Luna was disallowed the rite of <a href=\"/terrigenesis/4015-42287/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42287\">Terrigenesis</a> by the Inhumans because her being half human made exposure a risk to her health. Believing it to be his fate and duty, Pietro then took the crystals to the island of <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a> to begin his quest to re-power the world's de-powered mutants. He exposed several former mutants on Genosha to the mists with devastating results. His father condemns his actions, and for his disregard for the safety of those he exposes to the mists. The U.S. government intercepts him and takes control of the crystals. <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>, the leader of the Inhumans asks for the crystals back and is told by <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> that they are now the property of the U.S. government. The Inhumans take this threat to their culture and tradition as an act of war and declare war on the government of the United States. These events lead into the <a href=\"/silent-war/4045-43569/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43569\">Silent War</a> storyline.</p><p>For more information see the <a href=\"/son-of-m/4045-43600/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43600\">Son of M</a>.</p><h2>New Avengers</h2><p>It was noted by both <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> and <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a> that the energies of the de-powered mutants needed to go somewhere rather than simply ceasing to exist. When the Scarlet Witch de-powered the majority of the earth's mutants, the immense power was collected into the body of Alaskan mutant postal worker <a href=\"/the-collective/4005-42938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42938\">The Collective</a>. Michael had no idea that he was a mutant. His power was to absorb the energies of others, and his body instinctively reacted to the ambient energies of the de-powered mutants in the Earth's atmosphere and absorbed them. This immense load of power channeled into Pointer's body destroyed the post office and everyone in the vicinity. Amongst the energies which had been ambient in the atmosphere was the consciousness of the deceased mutant <a href=\"/xorn/4005-3183/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3183\">Xorn</a>. When he absorbed these powers, Xorn was able to take possession of Pointer's body. Most likely realizing what he now was, Xorn seeks out Magneto who was de-powered on M-Day.</p><p>Xorn in Pointer's body (now the being known as the Collective) begins to travel down from Alaska through the Canadian wilderness on foot. The Collective is confronted by the Canadian Super-Team <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a> in an attempt to stop him. In almost no time the Collective laid waste to the entire team, leaving them dead in the snow (with the exception of <a href=\"/sasquatch/4005-1478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1478\">Sasquatch</a> who was presumed dead but survived because of his healing factor). Unfazed, the Collective continued South. It was <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>, being one of the few involved in the <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a> that retained memory of the event, who initially figured out the Collective's origin when he realized that the powers he was exhibiting seemed to be those of the mutants de-powered on M-Day. At the time Spider-Man is on a <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> <a href=\"/helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\">Helicarrier</a>. He is rescued by fellow members of the <a href=\"/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\">New Avengers</a>, but not before S.H.I.E.L.D. telepaths were able to probe his mind to discover the truth behind the House of M.</p><p>In America the Collective moves through New York, continuing to ignore the pedestrians encountered on his trip. When he was attacked by the New Avengers he realized that he was able to fly. He is taken into space by the combined efforts of <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> and the <a href=\"/sentry/4005-1454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\">Sentry</a> but, again, has little problem circumventing the two when he hurls the Sentry into space and flies back to Earth. He heads straight to the island <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a> where he finds <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>. It was there that the Collective revealed that it is being controlled by Xorn, whose personality was able to dominate Pointer's own. Xorn explains that he sought out Magneto because the mutants are in need of a leader, and that they will follow Magneto's lead. Xorn re-powers Magneto. Magneto, no longer in control of his body begins to battle the New Avengers. Not wanting to be someone else's pawn Magneto begs the Avengers to kill him. He is taken down by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent <a href=\"/daisy-johnson/4005-43174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43174\">Daisy Johnson</a> who uses her power to create a tremor in Magneto's brain, separating the collective entity from him. The Collective is hurled into the sun by the Sentry, separating Michael Pointer from Xorn. Pointer and Magneto are both separately taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and the helicopter carrying Magneto's body explodes in mid air above Genosha.</p><h2>Deadly Genesis</h2><p>A startling revelation is made by a figure from the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>'s hidden past. When the original team of X-Men consisting of <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a>, <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a>, and <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a> are captured by the island mutant <a href=\"/krakoa/4005-26409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26409\">Krakoa</a> it was originally believed that <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a> assembled the new team of X-Men from around the world for a rescue mission. While these events did occur in this manner there was a first rescue team dispatched to Krakoa prior to the all-new all-different X-Men consisting of several of <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert</a>'s students: <a href=\"/petra/4005-40854/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40854\">Petra</a>, <a href=\"/sway/4005-40855/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40855\">Sway</a>, <a href=\"/darwin/4005-40600/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40600\">Darwin</a>, and <a href=\"/vulcan/4005-21233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21233\">Vulcan</a> (youngest brother of <a href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\">Havok</a> and Cyclops). This team was young and inexperienced and met with a quick defeat by the island. It was after this first rescue mission that Xavier gathered together a group of older, more experienced mutants from around the world. After the second team rescued the original X-Men, Krakoa was lifted into orbit by <a href=\"/polaris/4005-1473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1473\">Polaris</a>. The deaths of the first rescue team weighed heavy on the hearts of the X-Men so Xavier decided to remove the memory of the original team from the surviving X-Men. Only Vulcan survived having absorbed the powers of his fallen comrades, and remained in stasis on the island.</p><p>After the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> de-powered most of the world's mutant population when ending the <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a>, the energies of the de-powered mutants released back into the universe caused Vulcan to awake. Knowing what had happened Vulcan began to attack the X-Men, first psychologically and then physically to draw Xavier out (who had not been seen since before the House of M). Vulcan forced the de-powered Xavier to show his students what actually occurred surrounding the Krakoa incident. Before the X-Men were able to attack, Vulcan flew into space to make the <a href=\"/shiar/43138/\" data-ref-id=\"43138\">Shi'ar</a> pay for the traumatic childhood they caused him. The events of the Deadly Genesis lead directly into the <a href=\"/rise-and-fall-of-the-shiar-empire/43521/\" data-ref-id=\"43521\">Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire</a>.</p><p>For more information see the <a href=\"/deadly-genesis/4045-43520/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43520\">Deadly Genesis</a>.</p><h2>New X-Men</h2><p>After M-Day a large portion of the students at the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> are left powerless. <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a> disbands the teams of students and collects those whose powers remain in the danger room for an impromptu session to determine who will remain on a single squad of young X-Men trainees (the New X-Men). After a quick but intense battle session, the new team is selected. It is also decided that because of increased hostilities against mutants since M-Day, it would be safer for the de-powered students to be sent home rather than remaining at the institute. With the exception of <a href=\"/prodigy/4005-40475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40475\">Prodigy</a>, 42 de-powered mutants are loaded onto a bus to be taken away which, once full, explodes. This attack was perpetrated by long-time enemy of the X-Men, and political and religious crusader against mutants:<a href=\"/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\">William Stryker</a>. Stryker was aided by the remains of the future <a href=\"/sentinel/4005-8299/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8299\">Sentinel</a> <a href=\"/nimrod/4005-13314/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13314\">Nimrod</a>, whose memory banks are used to determine which of the surviving mutants to target. After unsuccessfully attempting to murder <a href=\"/dust/4005-4555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\">Dust</a>, Stryker and his \"Purifiers\" are stopped by the New X-Men during an assault on the mansion. In order to stop Stryker, <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir</a> reversed his powers from a healing touch to a death touch, killing Stryker. The New X-Men then discovered that the remains of Nimrod had gone after <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\">Forge</a> to force Forge to build it a new body.</p><p>While the New X-Men were on their way to rescue Forge, Forge was able to trick Nimrod into downloading its personality into a prototype body which Forge had built. This new body had built-in safe-guards which prevented Nimrod's programming from taking over its new body. Misunderstanding what had happened, the New Mutants attacked the robot which released Nimrod's primary programming allowing it to attack. In the battle against Nimrod both <a href=\"/rockslide/4005-40456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40456\">Rockslide</a> and <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a>. Rockslide's body was obliterated Nimrod's blasts, but was re-assembled by his teammate <a href=\"/hellion/4005-40454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40454\">Hellion</a>'s telekinesis. X-23 was badly burned while destroying Nimrod's body, and her healing factor was unable to cope with the damage. Hellion flew back to the mansion, only able to make it back in time when Emma Frost used her telepathy to remove mental blocks allowing him full access to his powers. Back at the mansion Elixir was able to use his power to assist X-23's own healing factor, saving her life.</p><h2>Related Story Arcs</h2><p><a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a> - Precedes and creates the events of the Decimation.</p><p><a href=\"/rise-and-fall-of-the-shiar-empire/43521/\" data-ref-id=\"43521\">Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire</a> - Events following the <a href=\"/deadly-genesis/4045-43520/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43520\">Deadly Genesis</a> storyline.</p><p><a href=\"/silent-war/4045-43569/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43569\">Silent War</a> - Events following the <a href=\"/son-of-m/4045-43600/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43600\">Son of M</a> storyline.</p><p><a href=\"/endangered-species/4045-43950/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43950\">Endangered Species</a> - upcoming With the numbers of mutants in the world reduced from millions to thousands on M-Day, mutants are on the brink of extinction.

    "deck": "A group of students at Xavier's school who disagree with Professor X's views on human/mutant relations start a riot.",
    "description": "<p>There were two primary incidents that acted as a catalyst for the student riot at the mansion.  The first (although more indirect) was the death of famed mutant fashion designer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50481\" href=\"/jumbo-carnation/4005-50481/\" slug=\"jumbo-carnation\">     Jumbo Carnation</a>.  The second was a radical change in identity of the young mutant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40583\" href=\"/kid-omega/4005-40583/\" slug=\"kid-omega\">         Kid Omega</a>.  Quentin was one of the prized pupils of both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" slug=\"professor-x\">         Professor X</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">         Jean Grey</a>.  While his mutant powers were primarily undefined he was a genius and was capable of some telepathy.  Quentin's identity was called into question when he learned from his mother that he was adopted.  He lashed out at some of the other students, and began to abuse the mutant-enhancing drug <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42307\" href=\"/kick/4015-42307/\" slug=\"kick\">         Kick</a>.  He visited the site of Jumbo Carnation's death, and clung to the event as a personal cause.  Quentin had his hair cut to resemble an artist's rendition of mutants from the day he was born.  He also adopted a clothing style that was designed by Jumbo Carnation which was designed with human's fears and hatred of mutants in mind.  With a public open house happening at the mansion, Quentin hoped to make a bold and confrontational statement about how far mutants have come by embracing stereotypical images of mutants.  Kick was already boosting his mutant abilities, and his brain was processing over 10,000 brilliant ideas per second.</p><p>Quentin would have a public confrontation with Professor Xavier during their telepathy class.  He openly challenged Xavier's ideals of tolerance in favor of a much more radical view of human mutant relations, desiring not to live in a world side-by-side with Jumbo's human killers.  This display impressed several other students who began to follow Quentin's line of thinking.  With <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40586\" href=\"/glob-herman/4005-40586/\" slug=\"glob-herman\">    Glob Herman</a> still by his side fellow students Tattoo, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40588\" href=\"/phaser/4005-40588/\" slug=\"phaser\">         Phaser</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40587\" href=\"/skybolt/4005-40587/\" slug=\"skybolt\">         Skybolt</a> adopted the same clothing as Quentin forming the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40585\" href=\"/omega-gang/4060-40585/\" slug=\"omega-gang\">         Omega Gang</a>.  Now all five were abusing Kick, and ventured outside of the mansion that night.  In a back-alley they found a group of humans who they savagely beat, killing some.</p><p>Next the Omega gang attacked a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47994\" href=\"/u-men/4060-47994/\" slug=\"u-men\">         U-Men</a> hideout, killing all of the U-Men inside.  Upon arriving back at the mansion they waited in Professor Xavier's office to ambush him, knocking him out with a wooden bat.  The following day Xavier regained consciousness and found himself tied up and masked by a helmet that Quentin designed after the helmet worn by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\" href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" slug=\"magneto\">         Magneto</a>.  The helmet would prevent Xavier from using his telepathy on anyone the same way that Magneto's shielded his mind from telepaths.  This was the day of the mansion's open house, and as the attendees were approaching Quire announced to the campus that they were holding Xavier hostage and incited the students to riot.</p><p>The other students, guided by Quire, began a protest around the mansion which quickly escalated into violence.  The X-Men attempted to stop them, but the student body fought back.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">   Wolverine</a> was briefly incapacitated by Quentin's telepathy.  Radian, Tattoo, and Redneck fought with the X-Men and lost.  Glob Herman lit his body on fire and attacked a fleeing busload of humans.  He was subdued by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\" href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" slug=\"beast\">         Beast</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">  Cyclops</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3183\" href=\"/xorn/4005-3183/\" slug=\"xorn\">         Xorn</a>.  The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\" href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" slug=\"stepford-cuckoos\"> Stepford Cuckoos</a> had were executing a plan to stop Quire from doing any more harm.  Sophie took a dose of kick to augment her telepathic abilities, and used <a data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\" href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" slug=\"cerebro\">         Cerebro</a> to further enhance her power.  Together the five Cukoos were powerful, but with this added assistance they were able to completely take out Quire.  Quentin was left crying, battered, and beaten.</p><p>Quentin was rushed to Beast's lab where they discovered that the kick had caused his neurons to move faster than the speed of light, rapidly killing him by turning his brain into pure energy.  Xorn assisted Quire in this transition, easing him into a new form of being.  What was left of him would remain in stasis in Beast's lab.  The few remaining student protesters were met by Xavier who explained what had happened, and told them that they were welcome to continue protesting as long as they did it in a non-violent manner.  The Riot at Xaviers came to an end. </p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-30252\" href=\"/new-x-men-riot-at-xaviers/4050-30252/\" slug=\"new-x-men-riot-at-xaviers\">New X-Men: Riot at Xavier's</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-186306\" href=\"/new-x-men-ultimate-collection-book-2/4000-186306/\" slug=\"new-x-men-ultimate-collection-book-2\">New X-Men Ultimate Collection Vol. 2</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Distraught over the death Gwen Stacy and angry at Spider-Man, the Jackal, with the help of Norman Osborn, concocts an elaborate revenge scheme involving cloning.  He convinces Peter Parker that he is a clone and forces him to fight multiple copies of himself.",
    "description": "<h2>Publication History</h2><p>There have been multiple Clone Sagas over the years. The original was written in the 1970's by Gerry Conway. However, the sequel written in the 1990's largely eclipsed it and has become an extremely important event in <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>'s history. This second Clone Saga was written by <a href=\"/terry-kavanagh/4040-41035/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41035\">Terry Kavanagh</a> and <a href=\"/howard-mackie/4040-40629/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40629\">Howard Mackie</a>. The executive editors involved were <a href=\"/tom-defalco/4040-41037/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41037\">Tom DeFalco</a>, <a href=\"/bob-budiansky/4040-10224/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-10224\">Bob Budiansky</a> and <a href=\"/bob-harras/4040-40985/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40985\">Bob Harras</a>.</p><p>Originally, the story arch was intended to conclude within less than a year. However, when sales exceeded expectations, Marvel decided to prolong the saga, stretching it out over almost three years. Unfortunately, the changes made in the aftermath of this decision proved largely unpopular and ultimately caused the story to seem somewhat convoluted.</p><p>Since then, there have been a couple of additional attempts to revive and reboot the clone saga, including the 2006 Ultimate Clone Saga and a 2009 storyline called the Real Clone Saga.</p><h2>The Original Clone Saga</h2><p>The original Clone Saga began in \"<a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man/4050-2127/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2127\">Amazing Spider-Man</a> #144” (May 1975). The story takes place in the aftermath of the death of Peter Parker's girlfriend, <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy</a>. This event was an extremely traumatic experience for Spider-Man and almost led him to quit being a superhero. However, only a few months later, after finally coming to grips with his loss, he would have to go through emotional turmoil once again when Gwen Stacy seemingly returns from the dead.</p><p>As he would come to discover, her return was the work of a new super villain named <a href=\"/jackal/4005-10974/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\">Jackal</a>. Jackal’s real identity is that of Miles Warren, a biochemist at <a href=\"/empire-state-university/4020-43783/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\">Empire State University</a> where Peter and Gwen studied. It was here that Miles fell in love with Gwen. However, after her death, he was driven mad by grief and desperately sought to clone her. After a number of failed attempts he finally succeeded in perfecting the formula and created identical copies of both her and Spider-Man.</p><p>Jackal blames Spider-Man for Gwen's death and so, commands the clone to battle the original. Capitalizing on this opportunity, he also places a time bomb nearby. However, the fight between Spider-Man and the clone rages too long and the bomb goes off before Jackal can escape. In the end, the explosion kills both him and the clone, leaving Spider-Man the only one alive.</p><p>Unnerved by the experience and worried that he may actually be the clone, Spider-Man conducts some genetic tests in an attempt to confirm his identity as the original. However, afraid of the truth, he ultimately avoids the results. Instead, he convinces himself that his love for Mary Jane Watson is proof enough of his identity. He remembers having feelings for her before the clone appeared, and thus concludes that he must be the real Spider-Man.</p><p>The clone of Gwen Stacy moves on with her life. She leaves Empire State University in hopes of starting over somewhere new.</p><h2>Jackal's Genetic Weapon</h2><p>Years later, Spider-Man encounters <a href=\"/carrion/4005-14507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14507\">Carrion</a>, a clone of Warren who is suffering from genetic degeneration. After visiting Jackal's old laboratory, he discovers the professor's notes, which explain that Carrion is actually a genetic weapon created to infect all man kind with the degenerative disease. Deciding to put an end to Warren’s scheme, Spider-Man fights Carrion and defeats him. However, before the clone goes down, he manages to infect a student of Empire State University named <a href=\"/carrion/4005-14507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14507\">Malcolm McBride</a> with the plague, transforming him into a new Carrion.</p><h2>The New Clone Saga</h2><p>Many years later, it is revealed that the clone that Spider-Man had thought dead, had actually survived. Deeply depressed, he had left New York and taken on the name Ben Reilly, a combination of <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Uncle Ben's</a> first name and <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May's</a> maiden name. He had all the memories of Spider-Man, but knew he was a clone, and so, decided to keep his distance from Peter Parker. Moving to a different town, he made a new life for himself and started fighting crime as the <a href=\"/scarlet-spider/4005-6286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\">Scarlet Spider</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/629973-clones1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-629973\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.0227790432802\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/629973-clones1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-629973\"><img alt=\"Clones, clones, clones.\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/629973-clones1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/629973-clones1.jpg 878w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px\" data-width=\"938\"></a><figcaption>Clones, clones, clones.</figcaption></figure><p>However, when Aunt May becomes ill and is hospitalized, he decides he cannot keep away any longer and goes to visit her. This leads to a confrontation between him and Peter. At first, the two fight, but eventually they come to an understanding and become friends. Unfortunately though, Ben and Peter aren't able to rest easy for long. Soon after Ben arrives, a mentally unstable man named <a href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine</a> shows up and challenges the two to a fight. Kaine reveals that he was the result of Jackal's first attempt at cloning Spider-Man. Unfortunately, something had gone awry in the cloning process and he had developed the degenerative disease. This caused a large black mark to appear on his face and forced him to wear a specially designed black suit that kept the disease at bay.</p><p>Working together, Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider are able to defeat Kaine. Deciding they need to investigate further, they revisit Jackal's old lab. However, to their great surprise, he is revealed to be alive. He explains that the time bomb had actually killed a clone of himself, while he had lived on to continue his genetic experiments. Now ready to inflict the degenerative virus on the populace, he begins to put his plan into motion and commands a third Spider-Man clone named <a href=\"/spidercide/4005-25666/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25666\">Spidercide</a> to keep Spider-Man, Scarlet Spider, and Kaine at bay.</p><p>Fortunately, they are able to defeat Spidercide and stop Warren's mad scheme. However, before escaping, Jackal reveals that Ben Reilly is actually the original Spider-Man and that Peter Parker is really a clone. After conducting their own genetic test, Peter and Ben realize that what he said is true and are forced to rethink their lives. Peter is particularly distraught over this revelation. Feeling he has stolen Ben's life, he decides to stop being Spider-Man and move to Portland with Mary Jane to start a more humble life. With him now gone, Ben moves to New York permanently and becomes the new Spider-Man.</p><p>This became the status quo for close to a year. However, when Jackal reappears, Peter moves back to New York and works with Ben to investigate. Eventually they find the criminal and have another explosive battle. However, they would experience a huge shock when the long thought dead Norman Osborn reveals himself and explains that he had been secretly manipulating events all along. He tells them that he had switched the test results and that Peter really was the original Spider-Man, with Ben being the clone.</p><p>At first, they aren't sure if they should believe the former Green Goblin. However, after a climactic battle with the criminal, Ben is stabbed by the <a href=\"/goblin-glider/4055-55762/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55762\">Goblin's Glider</a> and dies. As he breaths his last breath, his body disintegrates, succumbing to the degenerative genetic disorder that all the clones suffer from. This finally proves that Peter is the original, and after defeating Norman Osborn, he returns to his old life as Spider-Man.</p><h2>Ultimate Clone Saga</h2><p>A rebooted version of the Clone Saga was later written by Brian Michael Bendis for Marvel's Ultimate imprint. In this telling, Spider-Man, after catching the Scorpion, learns that the villain is actually a clone, sharing 94.2% of his DNA with our hero. Soon afterward, Mary Jane is abducted. However, in his quest to find his missing girlfriend, Peter encounters several other clones of himself, including one with a disfigured face named Kaine , one with six arms named Tarantula , and a female clone named Spider-Woman. In the course of this adventure, he reveals his secret identity to Aunt May and the Fantastic Four, and encounters both an amnesiatic Gwen Stacy and his long thought dead father, Richard Parker.</p><p>After talking to Spider-Woman, he learns that each clone has inherited his love for Mary Jane. As a result, they each set out to protect her in different ways. Spider Woman and Tarantula both try to defend her from the other clones. However, Kaine eventually gets past them and administers the super human drug OZ to her in an attempt to make her more resistant to injury. Upon waking and discovering what has happened, Mary Jane is enraged and transforms into a large, red monster.</p><p>As the story continues, Spider-Man discovers that the masterminds behind the creation of the clones are Doctor Octopus and a scientist named Ben Reilly. It is revealed that Reilly stole a sample of Peter's blood shortly after the death of Gwen Stacy and with the help of Doc Ock and the consent of the FBI, had set out to create the duplicates. This leads to a confrontation between the villains and clones which ends with both Tarantula and Kaine dead, and Dr. Octopus captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. In addition, Gwen reveals herself as Carnage and Richard discovers that he is yet another clone of Peter Parker, aged artificially and implanted with false memories. In the end, the clone posing as Richard Parker dies from rapid aging, Spider-Woman helps Peter defeat Octavius, and Reed Richards finds a cure for Mary Jane's affliction. Peter's relief at her safe condition leads him to rediscover his true feelings for her and resume their relationship. Spider-Woman runs away to start a new life somewhere else, and the Scorpion and Gwen Stacy are left in the custody of Nick Fury.</p><h2>Spider Wars</h2><p>The Clone Saga was also adapted by the 1990's Spider-Man television series in a storyline known as the Spider Wars. This version, however, differs in some significant ways. In a departure from the comics, the other Spider-Men are not clones, but are alternate reality versions of Spider-Man.</p><p>The story begins in a distopic alternate Earth. In this Universe, a version of Spider-Man who has bonded with Carnage sets off a massive bomb that turns his world into a barren wasteland. However, unsatisfied with the destruction he has wrought, he decides to build an even larger bomb that can do the same to other alternate worlds. To thwart this menace, the cosmic being known as the Beyonder gathers six Spider-Men from different Universes to stop him.</p><p>In addition to the mainstream Spider-Man, his other champions include the Iron Armor Spiderman, the Octo-Spiderman, the mutant Spiderman, Scarlet Spider, and an actor who, in his world, plays Spider-Man on television. The Spider-Man from the animated series was made leader of the team, and, together, they travel to confront Spider-Carnage. There is an intense fight. However, the villainous Spider-Man escapes with his bomb to the world of Iron Armor Spider-Man.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Beyonder has been weakened and is only able to teleport one person to pursue the villain. As leader, the mainstream Spider-Man volunteers and so, is sent to track down Spider-Carnage in this new world. He quickly finds him. However, after a short fight, he realizes he isn't strong enough to win. Thinking the matter over, he realizes that the only way to stop him may be to appeal to his good nature. He finds Uncle Ben, who, in this Universe, never died, and, with his help, tries to convince Spider-Carnage to abandon his plan.</p><p>His idea works, and the alternate Peter is able to fight the influence of Carnage. Desperate to stop the monster, he uses the weapon to kill himself and Carnage, thus saving the Multiverse. As thanks, the Beyonder allows Spider-Man to meet Stan Lee and then sends him back to his world.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/essential-amazing-spider-man-volume-7/4000-141218/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-141218\">Essential Amazing Spider-Man #7</a></li><li><a href=\"/green-goblin-a-lighter-shade-of-green-green-goblin-a-lighter-shade-of-green/4000-293486/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293486\">Green Goblin: A Lighter Shade of Green</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-clone-genesis-spider-man-clone-genesis/4000-166480/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-166480\">Spider-Man: Clone Genesis</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-revelations-revelations/4000-127558/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-127558\">Spider-Man: Revelations</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-the-real-clone-saga-spider-man-the-real-clone-saga/4000-222241/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-222241\">Spider-Man: The Real Clone Saga</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-clone-saga-epic-book-one/4000-209111/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-209111\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Clone Saga Epic #1</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-clone-saga-epic-book-two/4000-216449/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-216449\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Clone Saga Epic #2</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-clone-saga-epic-book-three/4000-232983/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-232983\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Clone Saga Epic #3</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-clone-saga-epic-book-four/4000-246605/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-246605\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Clone Saga Epic #4</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-clone-saga-epic-book-five/4000-260054/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-260054\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Clone Saga Epic #5</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-ben-reilly-epic-book-one/4000-286202/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-286202\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Ben Reilly Epic #1</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-ben-reilly-epic-book-two/4000-300963/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-300963\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Ben Reilly Epic #2</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-ben-reilly-epic-book-three/4000-311042/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-311042\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Ben Reilly Epic #3</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-ben-reilly-epic-book-four/4000-332740/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-332740\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Ben Reilly Epic #4</a></li><li><span><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-ben-reilly-epic-book-five/4000-347046/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-347046\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Ben Reilly Epic #5</a></span></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-original-clone-saga-spider-man-the-original-clone-saga/4000-278684/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-278684\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Original Clone Saga</a></li><li><a href=\"/ultimate-spider-man-clone-saga-clone-saga/4000-237651/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-237651\">Utimate Spider-Man: Clone Saga</a></li></ul><h2>Non U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-the-legend-reborn/4000-139732/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-139732\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #31</a> (UK)</li></ul>",

Thinking that perhaps his radioactive spider-bite is the cause, the heroes go to find an expert on radiation, <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Bruce Banner</a>. When they find him, Banner is in his <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Incredible Hulk</a> state and attacks them. Using a gas to calm him down they revert him back to Bruce Banner. Banner was also not able to find the cause of the problem so Peter goes to see <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a>. Black Panther gives Peter a special herb that is meant only for a warrior proven to be worthy of being king. This still does not cure Peter though. He decides to take a non-science approach to the problem and visits <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Dr. Strange</a>. Dr. Strange tells him that he can not be helped and that he has lived a long life and should prepare to die.</p><h3>Marvel Knights Spider-Man #20</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607745-otherblue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-607745\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5366666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607745-otherblue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-607745\"><img alt=\"Marvel Knights Spider-Man #20\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607745-otherblue.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607745-otherblue.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-width=\"624\"></a><figcaption>Marvel Knights Spider-Man #20</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> is excepting the fact that he is going to die.

During the fight Peter says that he has never been hit so hard and he has gone toe-to-toe with the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>. This is probably due to Morlun becoming stronger and Peter becoming weaker as the battle goes on. At the end of the battle, Morlun rips out Peter's eye and eats them, leaving him to die before the police show up.</p><h2>Black</h2><h3>Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #3</h3><p><a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter</a> is taken to the hospital after his battle with <a href=\"/morlun/4005-17613/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17613\">Morlun</a>.

Morlun makes it to Spider-Man's room before they do and wants to finish him off. Mary Jane defends Peter and attacks Morlun. Morlun, clearly the stronger of the two, knocks Mary-Jane back. Seeing this Peter gains the strength to fight on. With eyes glowing red, fangs, and stingers now shooting out of his arms, Peter dives on Morlun, stabbing him in the back and biting his neck eventually killing him. This last attack kills Peter too.</p><h3>Marvel Knights Spider-Man #21</h3><p><a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter</a>'s body has been moved to <a href=\"/stark-tower/4020-58113/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58113\">Stark Tower</a> where <a href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane</a> and the rest of the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> are staying. They are trying to figure out how they are going to explain to the world how Peter died without giving away that he is Spider-Man.

At the end of the issue, the alarm at Stark Tower goes off and the Avenger's rush to Peter's body. When they reach the room, the window is broken and Peter is gone with only his husk remaining. <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony</a> says that the window was bulletproof, so either someone was very strong or there is a lot they don't know about spiders.</p><h3>The Amazing Spider-Man #527</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607747-otherblack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-607747\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607747-otherblack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-607747\"><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #527\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607747-otherblack.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607747-otherblack.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #527\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607747-otherblack.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607747-otherblack.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Amazing Spider-Man #527</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> are out looking for <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter</a>'s body. It is revealed that he has made a cocoon that his body is in right now. While in it he has a dream about a spider eating everyone he was close to. This Spider then tells him that he has been denying what he really is and that he needs to embrace his true self. It appears that he does embrace his inner spider when he breaks free of the cocoon. He then returns to the Avengers and his family who can't believe he is alive.</p><h2>Gold</h2><h3>Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #4</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607749-othergold.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-607749\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.56\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607749-othergold.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-607749\"><img alt=\"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #4\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607749-othergold.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607749-othergold.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #4\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607749-othergold.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/607749-othergold.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #4</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter</a> is in <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony</a>'s lab, where the top minds in the world are trying to figure out why he is still alive.

    "deck": "Following the events of the House of M, mutants are on the brink of extinction with no new mutancy occurring in the human race. Will this be the end, or a new beginning for mutantkind?",
    "description": "<h2>Background</h2><p>When the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> had a mental breakdown and destroyed the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> (<a href=\"/avengers-disassembled/4045-43625/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43625\">Avengers Disassembled</a>), her brother <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> convinced her to alter reality. In a flash of light the world was changed. Mutants were no longer the minority, hated for the way they were born. Instead, normal humans were subjugated by the powerful mutagenic and super-powered population under the rule of <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>. Everyone lived content in this new world, knowing nothing of their original histories, only aware of this new world that the Scarlet Witch created. Slowly the Earth's heroes were awakened to what actually occurred by <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, the mysterious young mutant named <a href=\"/layla-miller/4005-1447/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1447\">Layla Miller</a>, and a small band of rebels. Things came to a breaking point during a battle at a celebration at Magneto's palace when the rebel group attacked. After <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>'s eyes were opened to what had actually occurred the world flashed bright white again and the Scarlet Witch changed reality back to how it was with a major exception--over 90% of the world's mutants were now de-powered and a population of mutants that once numbered in the millions now only totalled in the thousands.</p><p>Mutants are an even smaller minority than before. Many are taking the opportunity to target the remaining mutants. Few are aware of what actually occurred during this <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a> (referred to commonly as <a href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\">M-Day</a>). Speculation as to the reason for the mass de-powering range from a government conspiracy to an act of God. The once proud and mighty Magneto was one of the many mutants left powerless by his daughter. A being called the <a href=\"/the-collective/4005-42938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42938\">The Collective</a>, composed of the powers of all the de-powered mutants was born, came down from Alaska to locate Magneto. Telling Magneto that the mutant world needed a leader and that they would follow him, the Collective re-powered Magneto. Controlled by the Collective mind, Magneto is forced to battle the Avengers, who were able to remove the Collective from him. Magneto's weak body was taken into <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> custody, but the helicopter he was on exploded in mid-air. He has not been seen since.</p><p>Further reading: <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a>, <a href=\"/decimation/4045-43626/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43626\">Decimation</a></p><h2>Overview</h2><p>A young <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">Mutant</a> named Landru is dead. He was not a member of a super-powered peace keeping team. His powers were relatively unimportant. His death was not even out of the ordinary. Landru was hit by a motor vehicle and subsequently died. Still with the number of surviving mutants now numbering in the hundreds rather than the millions that once existed, the death of <i>any</i> mutant is a solemn occasion for mutant-kind. Most of the current <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> as well as the members <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a> paid a visit to Landru's funeral. Even <a href=\"/sebastian-shaw/4005-2175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2175\">Sebastian Shaw</a>, concealed by an image inducer, attended to pay his respects. All who attended the funeral understand some of its implications but perhaps more than <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a>. Beast reveals that since the events of <a href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\">M-Day</a> not a single mutant child has been born. It is as if the mutant race was simply removed from the equation.</p><p>Beast has sought help from some of the world's brightest minds including <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, and <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a> to no avail. None were able to help discern the root of mutancy's disappearance. Still determined to understand the root cause of mutant-kind's endangerment, and possibly restoring the species, Beast summons the nerve to invite some of the X-Men's greatest adversaries into the picture in hopes that such a team could discover what is happening. He initiates talks with the likes of <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>, <a href=\"/arnim-zola/4005-14876/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14876\">Arnim Zola</a>, <a href=\"/dr-kavita-rao/4005-4446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4446\">Dr. Kavita Rao</a>, <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mr. Sinister</a>, <a href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\">MODOK</a>, <a href=\"/spiral/4005-9722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9722\">Spiral</a>, <a href=\"/sugar-man/4005-3435/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3435\">Sugar Man</a>, <a href=\"/pandemic/4005-42336/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42336\">Pandemic</a>, and the <a href=\"/high-evolutionary/4005-13346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13346\">High Evolutionary</a> by way of a video conference in hopes that the competition between them would bait at least one of them into giving some form of assistance. Beast offers that in his research he has already discovered several important facets of their race which anyone who helped would become privy to, less some finds which he felt were too dangerous which he \"took off of the table\" by destroying. Contrary to Beast's hopes and expectations interest in teaming up remained low in the group. M.O.D.O.K. said that <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M</a> had their own plans for exploiting the situation. Still recovering from having his life's work thwarted by the likes of the X-Men, Pandemic offered no assistance and hopes for the extinction of mutants. Always arrogant, Mr. Sinister says that there is nothing scientifically that Beast has to offer him. Despite the mass rejection, Beast finds himself curious at the comments of one--the High Evolutionary--who remarked that he should not attempt to embark on such a journey when starting in the wrong direction.</p><p>Needing elaboration on his earlier comments, Beast embarks on a journey to meet with the High Evolutionary face-to-face in his hidden home high at the top of Wungadore Mountain. With the assistance of a team of locals that he hired (and with his appearance altered by an image inducer) Beast works to scale the mountain. Toward the top they are stopped by the Knights of Wungadore--the High Evolutionary's personal guards, who intend to turn Beast around. After fighting with the Knights and attempting to plead his case the image of the Evolutionary appears before them and commands his servants to allow Beast entrance to his fortress. There Beast pleads his case to the High Evolutionary himself, begging for some assistance in his quest to save mutants from the brink of extinction. Rather than offer assistance, the Evolutionary tries to talk Beast into abandoning his cause as he believes that the Extinction of mutant kind may simply be natural selection in action--regardless of its catalyst. The Evolutionary also divulges that Beast is not the first person to come to him in search of these same answers, but without elaborating on who else has taken up Beast's quest before him the High Evolutionary fades away revealing that Beast was again talking with a image of the Evolutionary as he continued his work elsewhere. The High Evolutionary commands his subjects to escort Beast out of the compound so that he may leave. With little more to go on than before, Beast must seek help elsewhere.</p><p>The next stop in his journey is at the research laboratory of Dr. Kativa Rao. With the scientific help of the extra-terrestrial enemy of the X-Men <a href=\"/ord/4005-4445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4445\">Ord</a> of the Breakworld, Rao had developed a \"cure\" which would permanently remove the mutant <a href=\"/x-gene/4015-42328/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42328\">X-Gene</a> from a mutant's genome making them human. Rao had fallen out of favor in the scientific community when it was revealed that her research and data was not her own but was instead provided by Ord. A laughingstock, Rao was now giving what help she could to one of the very mutant that even considered taking her \"cure\". Rao informed Beast that little was to be learned from her data. She informed him that she was done her quest, and that Beast could take anything from her that he needed, although she knew that she had nothing that would help. She revealed a refrigerator which held gene samples taken from thousands of mutants prior to M-Day which were provided to her by Ord. Even these genetic samples no longer contained any trace of the x-gene, just like their previous owners. Beast learns from this that the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> had not only de-powered millions of mutants around the world, save for the few remaining members of the species she eliminated all traces of the mutant x-gene which gave them their unique powers and abilities.</p><p>Hank's next stop was at the rumored Neverland facility, a compound in Canada created by the <a href=\"/weapon-x/4060-5018/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5018\">Weapon X</a> program for unethical experiments on mutants as well as eventual termination. This place, as Beast would discover, was not very unlike the camps used by the Nazi's during World War II. All that remained of the facility was the remains of the buildings as well as the impeccable daily records records kept by those in charge. Beast notices evidence of \"the other\" which the High Evolutionary had alluded to having already been there. Not only did this other rifle through the same records which Beast needed, he searched step by step in the same manner that Beast would, only days earlier. There was even evidence of the same search protocols having been used which Beast himself would run. Beast read through the horrific accounts of Neverland--from the experiments conducted, to the prevention of riots, to the collection and final extermination of its inmates as the facility would be closed down.
