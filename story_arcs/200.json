    "description": "<p><strong>LIVING HELL:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/karen-page/4005-4486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4486\">Karen Page</a>, former lover and secretary of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Matt Murdock</a>/Daredevil and one of the few people to know his secret identity, had became a junkie porn star. On her need to get a shot of heroine, Page sells Daredevil´s secret I.D. unchaining a series of events that would drive <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/hells-kitchen/4020-42295/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42295\">Hell´s Kitchen</a> vigilante near to insanity.</p><p>The indiscretion of Page soon reaches the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a>´s hands; who is more than eager to prove the information is true.</p><p>In a period of six month, Matt Murdock´s life becomes a living hell. His accounts are frozen by the IRS, the bank forecloses his home and even a police lieutenant, Nicholas Manolis, with a clean past, testifies against Murdock accusing him of buying witnesses. Also Murdock is barred from practicing law.</p><p>Murdock considers this to be just a strike of \"bad luck\", being unable to see his archenemies hand behind it. That is until the Kingpin went too far, bombing Murdock´s house. After this event, Murdock was convinced that it was his nemesis the responsible for this mayhem.</p><p>Unhinged and with poor mental health, Murdock has now become paranoid, and even suspects of his partner and best friend, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/foggy-nelson/4005-3124/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3124\">Foggy Nelson</a> and his former girlfriend, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/glorianna-obreen/4005-38821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38821\">Glorianna O´Breen</a>, of being part of the conspiracy against him and being allies to the Kingpin.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/ben-urich/4005-4799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4799\">Ben Urich</a>, a personal friend of Murdock and reporter for the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/4060-40822/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40822\">Daily Bugle</a>, investigates his friend´s situation, discovering the Kingpin´s involvement. The Kingpin finds this out and soon forces Urich into silence through violent actions. In a very poor condition and not finding any other way to solve his situation, Murdock faces the Kingpin and is easily taken down by the crime lord. Murdock is then drenched in whiskey and strapped into a taxi cab that is later pushed off a pier into the East River.</p><p><strong>PURGATORY:</strong></p><p>Murdock manages his way out the cab and is found homeless, severely injured and almost unable to walk. Rambling through Hell´s Kitchen, only his will power maintains him on feet. He is stabbed by a thug in an alley and later hit by a car. He is rescued by a nun, known as Sister Maggie (who is later revealed to be his mother), who aids him and nurses him back to health. Page reappears being hunted by the Kingpin´s men as part of the order he gave to disappear everyone who had touched the envelope where Daredevil´s secret ID was on. She is now in a relationship with an abusive drug dealer named Paulo Scorcese. She came back in an attempt to find Murdock. She is unable to find him, but she finds Nelson instead who protects her from Paulo.</p><p>The Kingpin is sure by now that Murdock is alive and becomes obsessed with finding him. He orders the \"nurse\" that killed the only source Ben Urich had to kill the reporter.</p><p>He releases a violent psychopath from an asylum who dresses up as Daredevil to kill both Page and Nelson to make Murdock reappear. However, Murdock destroys the Kingpin´s plans in both cases. He takes back his costume and saves Page from Scorcese and a hitman sent by the Kingpin. They are finally reunite and Murdock comforts Page, telling her he has gotten over the loss of his material possessions.</p><p><strong>HEAVEN:</strong></p><p>In a major mistake, the Kingpin uses his connections in the military to release the super soldier known as <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/nuke/4005-41866/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41866\">Nuke</a> (Frank Simpson), who is sent to attack Hell´s Kitchen. Dozens of civilian are killed and this is when Daredevil reappears for the first time since his house is destroyed.</p><p>After a mayor battle with Nuke, Daredevil defeats him after a while and the Avengers appear to take custody of Nuke. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/4005-1442/\">Captain America</a> distrusts of the answers given to him by Nuke´s superiors in the Army and breaks into Nuke´s files in a computer, discovering that Nuke was the only survivor of an attempt to recreate the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/project-rebirth/4015-55761/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55761\">Project Rebirth</a>, the one that originally gave Captain America´s powers.</p><p>Nuke manage to escape custody and heads towards the Daily Bugle to attack it, he is stopped by the Cap and the military tries to kill him.</p><p>Nuke does not die immediately after the attack and is taken by Daredevil to the Bugle, after realizing that he wouldn´t make it to the Hospital. This was to prove the Kingpin´s influence in the military. Fisk´s image as an honest man is completely shaken though avoiding jail.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/daredevil-born-again/4050-30019/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30019\">Daredevil: Born Again</a></li><li><a href=\"/daredevil-frank-miller-omnibus/4050-21192/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21192\">Daredevil: Frank Miller Omnibus</a></li><li>100 Greatest Marvels of All Time <a href=\"/the-100-greatest-marvels-of-all-time-13-10/4000-133636/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-133636\">#4</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/what-if-what-if-daredevil-killed-the-kingpin/4000-31557/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-31557\">What If...? #2</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>She-Hulk and Jazinda are on a cross-country chase from a bomber. Before they were driving it was already revealed that She-Hulk was having issues with being a \"Hero\" as they drove, a large thump hits their trailor roof. She-Hulk pummels the ship with blows but it keep coming back to her. There seems to be an attraction between the ship and She-Hulk. When She-Hulk rips the top off the ship, there lays an alien. He tells her to please save him. He promptly added that she should show loyalty for he is her future leader. She-Hulk tries to run away and not get involved, but Jazinda insists on helping him. Jazinda quickly identifies him as a Froma. Their race is heavy with gamma-radiation emmisions. His ship was attracted to She-Hulk's radiation. The alien identifies himself as Cazon, the once heir and now hunted. Cazon was accused of being a mass murderer of dozens of people because they didnt show support. Now he is on the run. She-Hulk promptly snaps out that she's done with the whole hero thing.</p><p>The story immediatly switches to one innocent camping couple. Larry and Tanya are on a camping trip trying to mend their marriage for their kids and themselves. In a moments notice a huge and strong alien is growling at them. Larry quickly tries to protect his wife by shooting the alien. The shot does no damage. The alien simply told Larry not to shoot him again and that he was taking their food. Larry and Tanya quikly prepare to leave the camp site. The story switches back to She-Hulk. \"There's no percentage in the whole hero thing thats why. Being a hero just gets people killed, yourself, other heroes, and innocent bystanders\", said She-Hulk to Jazinda. Jazinda states that Shulkie's only scared of herself. A large scream quickly interrups their more personal conversation. Cazon has a glowing leash around his neck. An alien bounty hunter refuses to let him go. Jazinda quickly steps in and holds an alien gun on him. The alien bounty hunter is revealed to be a Badoon. Jazinda shoots him but has only stunned him. The Badoon quickly jumps up and kills Jazinda. Jen quikly jumps in and fights the Badoon.</p><p>The story switches back to Tanya and Larry. Jazinda and Cazon run into Larry and Tanya as they are leaving. Cazon quickly takes Tanya as a hostage. Larry tells Cazon to let go of his wife. Instead, Cazon kills Tanya. \"You were accused of being a mass murderer. How can someone innocent of such crimes just kill someone,\" screams Jazinda. \"When did I say I was innocent,\" replied Cazon. He promptly shoots Jazinda with her own gun. The fight between She-Hulk and the Badoon continues. He quickly identifies her as one of the Magistrati; she quit that a while ago though. He says that he is Kodor a licensed Badoon bounty hunter. During the fight She-Hulk said that she was protecting her friend. Kodor quickly reveals to She-Hulk that it was of no avail, for Jazinda was slain by Cazon. Cazon takes Larry and levitates to Kodors ship.</p><p>Back to She-Hulk and Kodor, Shulkie sees Kodor messing with the corpse of Tanya. He is using a molecular stimulator to make her come back to life. He wants to question Tanya. Kodor quickly reveals to Tanya that she is dead and will only be alive for a few more moments. Kodor tries to calm her but she becomes hysterical. Kodor tries to kill her seeing her as no use , but Shulkie quickly jumps in. Jazinda, as if reborn from the dead, all of a sudden wakes up. Shulkie freaks out saying that she knew for sure that Jazinda was dead. At that moment they all spot in the sky Cazon in Kodor's ship with Larry attached to the outside. Shulkie quickly suggest that Kodor throw herself onto the ship to save Larry and bring down Cazon. Shulkie hangs on for dear life as Cazon tries to move the ship in a way to throw her off. She-Hulk dimly hears Larry's screams. Larry wont be able to handle the atmospheric pressure in a few moments. She-Hulk ends up having to swing herself onto the back of the ships huge fire breathing, I think, exaust pipe. As the fire hits her, She realizes how much she forgot the impact of real pain. The ship starts to sputter and goes down in a downward spiral. She-Hulk quickly goes down to the front of the ship to save Larry from an immediate death. Larry and She-Huk end up hitting the deep part of the lake, but Cazon and the ship end up at the shallow end. The impact of Larry and She-Hulk end up stripping her of her pants.</p><p>Cazon slowly steps out of the damaged ship. Kodor quickly holds a gun to him. Tanya, still alive, grabs the gun in an attempt to kill Cazon herself. Kodor tells her that he needs him alive, but Tanya said she needed him dead. She-Hulk steps in saying that Tanya wont want her last moment to be spent killing someone. Larry quickly comes once he spotted Tanya. Larry hugs her saying he thought she was dead. Tanya tells him that she is and she can feel herself fading. She told him to tell their kids that she loved them. Her last words were that she doesn't want to go. At that moment she abruptly turns into dust. After seeing that Jazinda kills Cazon by stabbing him through his chest with her own hand.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-167248\" href=\"/she-hulk-jaded-jaded/4000-167248/\" slug=\"she-hulk-jaded-jaded\">She-Hulk: Jaded</a></li></ul>",

A mystic created a blue gem, and imbued it with power.

When they get there, however, they start fighting each other. Wally follows them, and he too is filled with hatred. Realizing that the shards are causing it, he tries to rid the other speedsters of their shards, but too late. Cobalt Blue has possessed Jay Garrick, and now mentally controls all of the speedsters between the 20th and 30th century with two exceptions: Wally West, and Barry Allen. Barry comes to save Wally, and they two regroup and free Jay Garrick. The three Flashes free the other speedsters, but are unable to prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled: after all the speedsters but Barry and Wally leave, the living flame of Cobalt Blue kills Barry Allen. <br/> <br/>With Barry dead, history has been changed. Without Barry there to stop his tachyon cannon, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12165\" href=\"/anti-monitor/4005-12165/\" slug=\"anti-monitor\">       Anti-Monitor</a> has won the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\" href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" slug=\"crisis-on-infinite-earths\">      Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>. After trying to stop the Anti-Monitor, Wally realizes he must right history. He travels back to the point right before Cobalt Blue kills Barry, and pulls Cobalt Blue away.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p><b>Old Man Logan</b> is a character in an eight-issue story arc in the <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> ongoing series by the writer <a href=\"/mark-millar/4040-40805/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40805\">Mark Millar</a> and artist <a href=\"/steve-mcniven/4040-1773/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1773\">Steve McNiven</a> that debuted with Wolverine #66 in June 2008. Set more than fifty years in the future, it features a similar set up to another Millar book, <a href=\"/wanted/4050-18009/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18009\">Wanted</a>, in which the world's super villains ganged together to finally destroy almost all superheroes.</p><p>When the villains attacked, Logan was in the mansion until an explosion that killed Jubilee happened showing a full roster of X men villains. Wolverine killed every one of them only to reveal the enemies were illusions created by Mysterio and Wolverine actually killed the whole X men. Wolverine left the mansion broken and tried to kill himself but failed. Wolverine then decided to never draw his claws again and became a pacifist.</p><p>Logan lives with his wife Maureen, his son Scotty and daughter Jade on a plot of land in Sacramento, California, now part of land known as \"Hulkland\". He requires money to pay his rent to the landlords of this territory: the descendants of Bruce Banner, the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, who are a product of years of incestuous procreation originating with Banner and his first cousin <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a>. In order to pay off his rent, Logan accepts a job from <a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-65436/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65436\">Hawkeye</a>: help him navigate across the country and deliver a secret package, possibly illegal.</p><p>They Journey across America which is now owned by the new Kingpin (originally Magneto), Doctor Doom, and the Red Skull (who's now the president). They make their Journey finally reaching their destination of New Babylon. It then turned out Hawkeye's package was the super soldier serum and he was helping out on a revolution only to realize it was a sting. Hawkeye was killed and Logan was knocked out. The bodies were then taken to the Red Skull (dressed as Captain America) where Wolverine gained consciousness and fought the Red Skull. Wolverine finally broke his pacifist ways by decapitating the Red Skull with Captain America's shield. Wolverine then took the reward money and escaped with Iron man's armor. Logan then returned in time only to find his family killed by the Hulk gang. Logan then drawed his claws for the first time in 50 years and left with a vengeance.</p><p>Wolverine then went to the base of the Hulk gang and massacred everyone. Logan then went to the home of Bruce Banner (who's now an old man). Banner revealed that he had Logan's family killed so he could fight Wolverine one more time. They then fight, banner was able to knock Wolverine down without transforming but wolverine eventually stabbed Banner which made him turn into the Hulk and ate Wolverine. Sometime later while the Hulk is planning to restart the Hulk gang until Wolverine ripped out of Hulk's stomach killing him.</p><p>The story was concluded in Giant Size Old Man Logan (September 2009) with Wolverine riding off into the sunset with Bruce Banner Junior, heavily implying that this alternate version of Wolverine is the same character as \"The Hooded Man\" version.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/wolverine-old-man-logan/4050-31674/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-31674\">Wolverine: Old Man Logan</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/wolverine-inside-the-world-of-the-living-weapon-wolverine-inside-the-world-of-the-living-weapon/4000-220393/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-220393\">Wolverine: Inside the World of the Living Weapon</a></li><li><a href=\"/wolverine-mgc/4050-32512/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32512\">Wolverine MGC #66</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/lobezno-/4000-290740/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290740\">Lobezno #42</a></li><li><a href=\"/lobezno-/4000-290741/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290741\">Lobezno #43</a></li><li><a href=\"/lobezno-/4000-290742/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290742\">Lobezno #44</a></li><li><a href=\"/lobezno-/4000-290743/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290743\">Lobezno #45</a></li><li><a href=\"/lobezno-/4000-290744/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290744\">Lobezno #46</a></li><li><a href=\"/lobezno-/4000-290745/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290745\">Lobezno #47</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-exklusiv-/4000-291782/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-291782\">Marvel Exklusiv #84</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/rosomakha-starik-logan/4050-57126/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-57126\">Rosomakha.

    "description": "<p>Action Comics #864 is the Epilogue to this story. Lightning Lad and Superman catch up on old times when Batman interrupts them. They find the bodies of Karate Kid and Una in Gotham after their deaths in Countdown. This story is proceeded by The Lightning Saga and succeeded by <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56073\" href=\"/final-crisis-legion-of-three-worlds/4045-56073/\">Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds</a>.</p><h2>Detailed Plot Summary</h2><h3>Chapter One: Alien World</h3><p>The story begins in 3008 AD on an unidentified alien world. The planet is consumed in civil war and its people are nearing mutually-assured destruction. An alien couple decide to send their child to Earth, in the example of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\">Superman</a>. The father states that more than a thousand years ago (the present day), Kal-El was sent to Earth and became the universe's greatest hero, the ultimate symbol of truth and justice. The alien parents believe that Earth is the only hope for their son and send him off in a spaceship as their planet explodes into destruction. As the spaceship with the baby inside speeds into <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\" href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\">Earth</a>'s atmosphere, it passes by the Human Cultural Center satellite before crash-landing in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55733\" href=\"/smallville/4020-55733/\">Smallville</a>. An old couple passing by in their truck witness the landing of the craft, and approach it to investigate. As the alien child crawls out from the spaceship, the wife asks the husband what they should do. The husband replies that they should do what all law-abiding citizens would, and pulls out a shotgun.</p><p>In the present day, at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55695\" href=\"/daily-planet/4020-55695/\">Daily Planet</a>, Clark Kent rushes towards the elevator but the people inside ignore him and don't bother to keep the door open for him. He has a brief chat with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3213\" href=\"/jimmy-olsen/4005-3213/\">Jimmy Olsen</a> before <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1809\" href=\"/perry-white/4005-1809/\">Perry</a> appears and begins lecturing Clark. He states that Clark has a problem, citing Clark's lack of friends aside from Olsen, and tells Clark that he's a hell of a reporter but that he needs to learn how to reach out to people. As Perry continues chiding Clark for his lack of self-confidence, Clark hears cries of panic and uses his X-ray vision to look through the walls of the Daily Planet. He sees the source of the panic - a giant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4684\" href=\"/brainiac/4005-4684/\">Brainiac</a> trampling through the park. Clark quickly excuses himself, jumps out of window and changes into Superman. After some quick punches, Superman tears off the robot's face, only to reveal a monitor inside it. A mysterious green-skinned man tells Superman that his future needs him. A rainbow-colored ray shoots out of the monitor and hits Superman as the story flashes back to Clark's past.</p><p>We then go back to Clark's time as a teenager, as he stares sadly at the popular crowd - a group of football stars and pretty girls. He overhears them talking about him, and they comment on how he always acts as though he's afraid of getting hurt and of how creepy he is. As Clark walks off alone, he suddenly sees a passing bird flying beside him, and quickly looks around. After making certain that there's no one around, he leaps into the skies and flies with a flock of birds. After a while, he lands, only to find himself face-to-face with three flying teens. They introduce themselves as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1264\" href=\"/cosmic-boy/4005-1264/\">Cosmic Boy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1273\" href=\"/saturn-girl/4005-1273/\">Saturn Girl</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1253\" href=\"/lightning-lad/4005-1253/\">Lightning Lad</a>, and they tell him that they wanted to meet and thank him. Clark is surprised when they tell him that sometime soon the world will accept him, and Cosmic Boy gives him a Legion flight ring. As they fly off, heading towards their time sphere, Clark asks if he can follow them to the future. Lightning Lad persuades Cosmic Boy to let him, and Clark goes to the future - where he meets the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\" href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>.</p><p>Back in the present, the ray has made Clark remember his school-day adventures with the Legion, and he recognizes <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\" href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> as the man in the monitor. Brainiac 5 then goes on to say that the Legion chose not to involve Superman in the future crisis but that they now have no choice but to. The Brainiac robot's chest cavity opens up, revealing a time sphere inside, and Brainiac tells him to step inside to go to the year 3008. A flight ring is inside the time sphere, and the sphere vanishes as it sends Superman hurtling into the future.</p><p>When Superman finally arrives, he stumbles out of the time sphere into the Legion's headquarters, only to find it in shambles. The statue of Superman and the Legion has been broken and defaced, and when Superman turns around, he sees members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-23409\" href=\"/science-police/4060-23409/\">Science Police</a> training guns on him. Just before they shoot him, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1271\" href=\"/colossal-boy/4005-1271/\">Colossal Boy</a> suddenly emerges from the walls and knocks out all of the officers with one blow. Shrinking back down to normal size, he collects the Legion flight rings before recognizing Superman. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3622\" href=\"/dawnstar/4005-3622/\">Dawnstar</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3621\" href=\"/wildfire/4005-3621/\">Wildfire</a> also appear and when Superman explains how Brainiac 5 contacted him, Dawnstar replies that Brainiac 5 has been missing for over six months. Wildfire then tries to drag Superman back into the time sphere but the sphere is destroyed by Science Police reinforcements. As the SP officers open-fire at Superman and the Legionnaires, Superman holds a hand up to stop them, only to find that the Science Police lasers shoot right through his hand. As Superman stares at his wound in shock, Dawnstar tells him to activate his ring as they all make an escape.</p><p>The issue ends with the four of them flying off, as Dawnstar reveals that the Earth's sun has turned red in the future.</p><h3>Chapter Two: Illegal Aliens</h3><p>The next issue begins with Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl, and Lightning Lad zipping down into the Batcave. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\">Batman</a>'s headquarters is in a state of ruin in 3008 AD. Cosmic Boy then states that they have to look for proof that Krypton existed, and tries searching for a Kryptonite ring that Batman kept as a safeguard against Superman. He and Lightning Lad have a short spat where Lightning Lad tells him that they should fight the Justice League. Cosmic Boy retorts that it will accomplish nothing, and asks how the Legion would look to Earth's people if they took down their heroes. Lightning Lad replies that he doesn't care anymore, but Saturn Girl interrupts, asking him what would Superman think. Lightning Lad finally concedes at this, and Saturn Girl says that the universe will go to war if they fail - all in the name of Superman. Suddenly, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-52497\" href=\"/justice-league-of-earth/4060-52497/\">Justice League of Earth</a> emerges from a hole in the ceiling. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32576\" href=\"/earth-man/4005-32576/\">Earth-Man</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3365\" href=\"/spider-girl/4005-3365/\">Spider-Girl</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48709\" href=\"/tusker/4005-48709/\">Tusker</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48710\" href=\"/golden-boy/4005-48710/\">Golden Boy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48711\" href=\"/storm-boy/4005-48711/\">Storm Boy</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31023\" href=\"/radiation-roy/4005-31023/\">Radiation Roy</a> appear, ready for a fight.</p><p>Cosmic Boy uses his magnetic powers to hurl <a data-ref-id=\"4055-46297\" href=\"/batarang/4055-46297/\">Batarangs</a> and a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\" href=\"/batmobile/4055-41463/\">Batmobile</a> at Earth-Man but Earth Man easily deflects them. Earth-Man asks Cosmic Boy why the Legion refuses to leave Earth, asking him why he doesn't leave like so many other Legionnaires have, and Cosmic Boy replies that the Legionnaires who left Earth did so because their homeworlds exploded into the violence caused by the League's crusade. Tusker throws a punch at Lightning Lad, who dodges it and returns fire with a lightning bolt. But Golden Boy manages to land a punch on Lightning Lad, and Storm Boy finishes him off with a quick lightning strike. Saturn Girl tries to gain telepathic control of both Storm Boy and Golden Boy, but Spider-Girl ambushes her from behind, snaring Saturn Girl in her hair, and throws her off to Radiation Roy. Radiation Roy seizes her, his perverted thoughts causes Saturn Girl to panic, and he shocks her with a quick blast of energy. With Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl down, the Justice League of Earth surrounds Cosmic Boy.</p><p>At the former <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57512\" href=\"/braal/4020-57512/\">Braal</a> Embassy, Superman has his wound treated by Dawnstar while Colossal Boy and Wildfire start a small fire. Superman asks what's going on and asks why the Legion doesn't want his help, and Dawnstar replies that they were afraid he would be hurt in the red sun (which he doesn't have powers under). Wildfire then states that the Legion agreed that no matter what happened, they couldn't risk Superman's life, as he was the most important figure in intergalactic history. Dawnstar then states that if Superman was killed in the future, everything that he represented wouldn't come to pass - universal laws, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56731\" href=\"/united-planets/4060-56731/\">United Planets</a>, peace on Earth, and even the Legion. Colossal Boy then states that Earth is seceding from the United Planets, and begins to bemoan at the loss of his wife - <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50657\" href=\"/chameleon-girl/4005-50657/\">Yera</a> - who was cast out because she was a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42477\" href=\"/durlans/4060-42477/\">Durlan</a>. Dawnstar consoles him and tells them that they will find Yera and all the other Legionnaires. Wildfire then says that sending Superman back is a bigger priority, but Superman knows them well enough to realize that they're hiding something from him.</p><p>In the Human Cultural Center orbiting Earth, which is the HQ of the Justice League, we learn what that 'something' is. In a classroom inside the center, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50656\" href=\"/eyeful-ethel/4005-50656/\">Eyeful Ethel</a> teaches a group of human schoolchildren about the 'truth' regarding Superman's origins - that he was not an alien, but rather, a human given powers by Mother Earth. She then goes on to say that the humans had been fooled by the Legion, which was secretly an 'alien invasion', and states that many tryouts were rejected by the Legion simply because they were human. She then goes on to say that the focus of today's lesson will be Kirt Niedrigh, formerly known as Absorbancy Boy, who was also rejected by the Legion for being human. She relates how Niedrigh found an ancient crystal that documented the true history of Superman - that he was a human who despised aliens - and talks about how Absorbancy Boy eventually became Earth-Man and formed the Justice League of Earth. As she is talking, one of the kids suddenly gets excited when he spies the Justice League walking past the classroom. The kids begin cheering 'Long Live Humans' as the Justice League carries the bodies of the three Legion founders, encased in triangular cases.</p><p>In another room, Earth-Man places the three founders among a collection of captured Legionnaires and absorbs all of their powers (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-1256\" href=\"/invisible-kid/4005-1256/\">Invisible Kid</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1257\" href=\"/phantom-girl/4005-1257/\">Phantom Girl</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1267\" href=\"/ultra-boy/4005-1267/\">Ultra-Boy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12835\" href=\"/shrinking-violet/4005-12835/\">Shrinking Violet</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9357\" href=\"/blok/4005-9357/\">Blok</a> are also among those captured). He then gets a call from Spider-Girl, who tells him that a Superman lookalike was reported being seen at Legion HQ and that the remnants of a time sphere were found nearby.</p><p>Somewhere else, we see Superman coming to terms with the lies that have been told about him. Superman then states that they have to find Brainiac 5, as he must have had a reason and plan for bringing Superman to the future, and Dawnstar tells him that his trail leads to Alien Holding Camp 6736. She states that there is where her tracking powers tell her Brainiac 5 is, and mentions that she can also sense another Legionnaire inside.</p><h3>Chapter Three: Lightning and Shadows</h3><p>In the former headquarters of the Legion, the Justice League of Earth are examining the remnants of the time sphere. Golden Boy states that Earth-Man said Superman would never returned, and Earth-Man replies that they have to keep the truth about Superman from spreading. Spider-Girl comments that Superman is powerless under the red sun, and Earth-Man says that this is their chance to end it. Once Superman is dead, his name and story will belong to the Justice League of Earth - forever.</p><p>In Alien Holding Camp 6736, a Legionnaire is being beaten up by the camp's warden. The Legionnaire refuses to tell the warden what he wants to know, and the warden continues turning up the heat as he resumes punching the Legionnaire. Suddenly, one of the camp's guards contacts the warden and tells him that the camp is under attack by the Legion. Colossal Boy, Wildfire, Dawnstar, and Superman break into the camp and begin freeing the aliens imprisoned there. Superman beats up a number of the guards, sustaining a wound on his forehead, and notices the freed aliens staring at him with skepticism. Superman says that he is who he says he is, but a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55373\" href=\"/korugarians/4060-55373/\">Korugarian</a> child comments that Superman doesn't bleed. Dawnstar leads them to Brainiac 5's cell, but there's no one inside, and Dawnstar senses that Brainiac 5 had somehow managed to teleport himself back to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56505\" href=\"/colu/4020-56505/\">Colu</a>. The four of them then make contact with the second Legionnaire who was captured there - <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12858\" href=\"/polar-boy/4005-12858/\">Polar Boy</a>. Polar Boy has lost his right arm, but makes an icy copy with his powers, and tells Superman that Brainiac has a plan to convince Earth about Superman's true heritage. He then states that him and Brainiac 5 were on their way underground before being captured by the Justice League.</p><p>Suddenly, darkness envelopes the four of them, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1261\" href=\"/shadow-lass/4005-1261/\">Shadow Lass</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12875\" href=\"/night-girl/4005-12875/\">Night Girl</a> appear. Shadow Lass teleports the four of them and the freed aliens to their 'clubhouse' - a secret location which the Legion uses to help aliens flee back to outer space via wormholes. There, they meet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\" href=\"/lightning-lass/4005-30997/\">Lightning Lass</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3619\" href=\"/timber-wolf/4005-3619/\">Timber Wolf</a>, and Timber Wolf gives the rundown on what happened to all the other Legionnaires (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-21508\" href=\"/mon-el/4005-21508/\">Mon-El</a> was banished to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\" href=\"/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\">Phantom Zone</a>, Spider-Girl traded <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30998\" href=\"/black-witch/4005-30998/\">White Witch</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4904\" href=\"/mordru/4005-4904/\">Mordru</a> in exchange for Earth's safety, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\" href=\"/chameleon-boy/4005-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a> returned home to Durla et cetera). Lightning Lass begins programming one craft for Colu, before they all hear Earth-Man in their heads. The Justice League of Earth suddenly ambush the clubhouse - revealing that they were following them through Earth-Man (who was using the telepathy he stole from Saturn Girl).</p><p>Earth-Man blasts Shadow Lass with a lightning bolt he stole from Lightning Lad, while Night Girl begins punching Radiation Roy. Lightning Lass attacks Spider-Girl, and Dawnstar and Timber Wolf try to prevent Superman from interfering with the fight. Timber Wolf then tells Superman, Dawnstar, Colossal Boy, Polar Boy, and Wildfire that they need to leave for Colu and find Brainiac, and as the other Legionnaires hold the Justice League off, the five of them leave via a wormhole. But just as they flee, Storm Boy manages to fire off one lightning bolt that damages their craft. As they emerge in Colu, their damaged ship is unable to make a safe landing and crash-lands on the planet. When Superman pulls himself out of the ship, he is suddenly surrounded by Coluans who inject wires into him. He blacks out.</p><p>Superman wakes up to find himself imprisoned, and comes face-to-face with the new ruler of Colu - Brainiac 5. Brainiac 5 tells Superman that he is to be terminated.</p><h3>Chapter Four: Chameleons</h3><p>In Braal, two soldiers are talking as one comments that Earth has seceded from the United Planets. In the background, we can see the Braal army preparing for war with their tanks. On <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41103\" href=\"/titan/4020-41103/\">Titan</a>, a group of men and women are discussing about how humans dare question Superman's <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45710\" href=\"/kryptonians/4060-45710/\">Kryptonian</a> heritage and their lies about Superman being a xenophobic human. On <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56915\" href=\"/winath/4020-56915/\">Winath</a>, as pilots begin readying their planes, a Winath pilot states that Earth's government has begun imprisoning any alien left on the planet. The pilot states that as soon as Colu delivers their strike plans, the United Planets will go to war with Earth.</p><p>Back on Colu, Superman is shocked by Brainiac 5's new personality, and Superman thinks that Brainiac 5 has been brainwashed by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55891\" href=\"/coluans/4060-55891/\">Coluans</a>. Brainiac 5 replies that that is impossible, and states that there is no other option but war now - and that humans are emotionally volatile and stupid animals. He then goes on to say that the logical choice would be to eliminate Earth, and he then tells his robotic guards to continue the strike plan calculations. Brainiac 5 says that he will kill his former colleagues himself, and the robots leave him to it. But when the robots are gone, Brainiac 5 finally reveals his ruse and asks Superman with a relieved, \"What the hell took you guys so long?\". As the other Legionnaires wake up, Brainiac 5 releases them from their imprisonment and explains what he's been doing all along. He states that he set himself up as Colu's ruler to slow down their strike plans against Earth. He then states that he has also planted a spy inside the Justice League's headquarters.</p><p>In the Human Cultural Center, the children there are with the Justice League as they observe the newly-captured Legionnaires in their cases - Shadow Lass, Lightning Lass, Night Girl, and Timber Wolf. As the kids eventually leave for their bus, Earth-Man states that it is time for the next stage of their crusade: to locate and execute every alien on Earth. He states that they will head for Earth in two hours. As the Justice League go off-duty, a lawyer visits Golden Boy and asks him to pay for his mother, who wants a vacation to a Paris spa. Golden Boy seems annoyed by this, and states that he never received anything from his mother except lawyers begging him for money. He then touches the lawyer, turning him into a statue of gold, and tells his servants to give that to his mother before saying that he wants to be polished. Meanwhile, Storm Boy is angry that he failed to stop Superman and the other escaping Legionnaires, and tells his surgeons that he wants to increase his power capacity. The surgeons tell him that they need to remove his heart for the procedure, and that they can't use anesthetic, but Storm Boy tells them to do it anyway. Elsewhere, Spider-Girl and Radiation Roy are reminiscing about their days in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47190\" href=\"/legion-of-super-villains/4060-47190/\">Legion of Super-Villains</a> before Roy tries to cop a feel. Roy opens up his helmet, revealing his hideous, tumor-covered face, and asks Spider-Girl 'just once...for old time's sake'. Spider-Girl replies, 'Not with that face'. In Earth-Man's room of captured Legionnaires, he absorbs all of their powers and puts on a red cape with an Earth logo on it.</p><p>As he walks off, a little girl emerges from the walls and finds Legionnaire <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1259\" href=\"/sun-boy/4005-1259/\">Sun Boy</a> hooked up to a machine that's feeding off of his powers. The little girl begins recording a log, stating that Brainiac was right and that Sun Boy has been imprisoned and used to turn the sun red - before she is choked by an invisible hand. Earth-Man suddenly emerges, stating that he had heard the girl's thoughts earlier, as the girl transforms to her true form - Chameleon Girl. Back on Colu, Colossal Boy slams Brainiac 5 to the wall when he learns that Yera is Braniac's spy. They have a brief verbal spat before Superman calms everyone down, stating that he trusts Brainiac. Brainiac then tells Colossal Boy that he wouldn't have sent Yera in there if she couldn't handle herself. Colossal Boy finally softens, and hands Braniac 5 a Legion ring. Suddenly, the Coluans emerge and try to arrest Brainiac 5 - stating that he is a traitor to the United Planets. Braniac 5. Earth-Man had earlier read Timber Wolf's mind, learning that Brainiac 5 was simply conning Colu, and was the one who tipped off the Coluans.</p><p>As the Coluans attack, the team flee in another spacecraft. As they fly away from Colu, Brainiac 5 states that without him slowing them down, the Coluans will finish formulating the United Planets strike plans in another four hours.</p><h3>Chapter Five: Revenge of the Rejects</h3><p>The issue begins with a flashback to both Superman and Polar Boy's earlier days. We see Clark failing at baseball and then meeting the Legion. We also see Polar Boy failing to control his powers and then meeting the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47111\" href=\"/legion-of-substitute-heroes/4060-47111/\">Legion of Substitute-Heroes</a>. In Superman's narration, he states that he knows what it feels like to be rejected, but that it doesn't mean you get a free pass to take it out on the world. He also says that you can't shut yourself off from others, or you might miss people that you'll fit right in with.</p><p>Back in the present day, in the spacecraft with Brainiac 5, Dawnstar, Colossal Boy, Wildfire, and Polar Boy, Superman states that they should call in the Substitute-Heroes. Wildfire questions their reliability - as they're also rejects like the League - but Brainiac 5 explains that the League's members were rejected because their telepathic profiles revealed psychotic tendencies and deviant obsessions. Brainiac 5 then reveals that he has been in communication with the Subs since they went underground, and they agree on sending them in. At the Human Cultural Center, Earth-Man continues to fight with Yera, before defeating her. As he knocks her out, he begins screaming about how Superman should have been rejected and that he was the real pretender. In the classroom, Ethel is talking to Tusker and comments on how late the school bus is. She suddenly spots the bus approaching towards a window, and is pushed aside by Tusker just as the bus crashes through into the satellite. The bus slams through multiple rooms, interrupting Golden Boy's polishing, Storm Boy's operation, and even Radiation Roy with Spider-Girl. As the bus slams to a stop, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12876\" href=\"/stone-boy/4005-12876/\">Stone Boy</a> bursts out of the vehicle and hits Radiation Roy.</p><p>The Substitute-Heroes emerge from the bus' wreckage, all triumphant and ready to fight. Among its members are <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51582\" href=\"/rainbow-girl/4005-51582/\">Rainbow Girl</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32220\" href=\"/chlorophyll-kid/4005-32220/\">Chlorophyll Kid</a>, Stone Boy, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32221\" href=\"/fire-lad/4005-32221/\">Fire Lad</a>. Ethel tries to get them to renounce their Legion membership and join the League, but Rainbow Girl quickly turns on her red 'rage' power and attacks Ethel. Chlorophyll Kid throws roses at Storm Boy, while Fire Lad uses his flaming breath to melt Golden Boy. Radiation Roy and Spider-Girl attempt to break Stone Boy, while Rainbow Girl seizes hold of the school bus with her blue 'hope' powers and crushes Tusker with them. In other part of the Center, Superman and the team break in while the Subs distract the League and split up. Polar Boy, Wildfire, and Dawnstar are sent to aid the Subs, while Superman, Brainiac 5, and Colossal Boy head off to rescue the other Legionnaires.</p><p>Superman's team finds the other captured Legionnaires, encased in their triangular cages. Brainiac 5 notices the crystal tablet that tells of Superman's 'true human heritage' nearby (the one that Earth-Man found), and comments that it appears to be a real relic, and not fabricated. Finally, the three of them locate Sun Boy, and realize that the Justice League was using his powers to turn the sun red. As Brainiac tries shutting the device down, Yera suddenly emerges and falls into Colossal Boy's arms. While Colossal Boy asks his wife if she's alright, Superman notices a draped glass case in the corner and pulls it off to reveal the real Yera inside it. The 'Yera' in Colossal Boy's arms absorbs his powers before transforming back into Earth-Man. After knocking Colossal Boy out, Earth-Man and Superman break out into a brawl. Earth-Man beats Superman mercilessly, before Superman slams Earth-Man out a window and into space.</p><h3>Chapter Six: Sun Rise</h3><p>As the forces of the United Planets approach Earth, Superman and Earth-Man continue fighting in space. Earth-Man flies Superman down to the planet's atmosphere with the intent of crushing him all over the ground. In the Cultural Center, Colossal Boy frees his wife while Brainiac 5 frees Sun Boy. But the Sun is still red, and Brainiac 5 explains that the connection will only be cut when Sun Boy is conscious. He then tells Yera that she needs to kiss him (citing Sun-Boy's attraction to brunette girls), and she does so by transforming to a brunette (albeit reluctantly). With Chameleon Girl's kiss, Sun Boy wakes up and the Sun is restored to yellow just as Earth-Man hurls Superman towards the planet. As Superman falls to the ground, the Sun returns to its original form, and Superman regains his powers. As he lands on the streets, he tears open a Science Police van and frees the aliens that were being locked inside. A Science Police officer tries to shoot him, but he deflects the beam with his hand, saying that he fights for the rights of everyone - human and alien.</p><p>Earth-Man suddenly emerges and throws a lightning bolt at Superman. Superman tells the Science Police officers to get everyone clear, and tells them to be 'nice to each other while he's gone'. He then breaks into a brawl with Earth-Man. Earth-Man attacks Superman with Phantom Girl's phasing, Lightning Lad's electricity, and Blok's strength, and asks Superman 'what do you have to beat me'. Superman replies, 'the real thing', just as the entire freed Legion appears behind him, ready to fight. The Legion members all attack Earth-Man, but he is able to repel all of them with the multiple powers he has. As he realizes that his ruse is breaking down and that his entire plan is falling apart, Earth-Man charges at Superman, screaming that Kal-El was never an outsider. Superman knocks him out with one punch and says, 'I've been an outsider all my life'. Lightning Lad congratulates Superman on his knockout, but Brainiac 5 notes that he's picking up Coluan transmissions.</p><p>In outer space, as the United Planets approaches Earth, a Braal officer spots Superman and the Legion forming a line in Earth's atmosphere. Superman tells the United Planets to go home, and that there won't be any war today.</p><p>24 hours later, the Legion regroups in their old headquarters with Superman, and Cosmic Boy comments on how much work they have ahead of them. He states that the United Planets aren't happy with either the Legion or Earth. Brainiac 5 states that the Justice League are on their way to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56390\" href=\"/takron-galtos/4020-56390/\">Takron-Galtos</a> and that the Subs have taken over the Human Cultural Center. The Legion then say that they're going to find all of their lost members, and Superman tells them that no matter how dangerous it is, he wants them to call him the next time they need his help. Brainiac 5 replies that they will, and then they send Superman back to his own era.</p><p>The story ends with Superman returning to the spot where he used to meet the Legion after school, back in his younger days. A L was carved into the nearby tree by Lightning Lad, and it's still there after all these years.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-36210\" href=\"/superman-and-the-legion-of-super-heroes/4050-36210/\">Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<p><b>Synopsis</b></p><p>Superman and Batman decide to rid the Earth of Kryptonite by gathering it all up, using a computer that detects Kryptonite, and tossing it into the sun. This decision was made after the two found out that the Superman/Batman filming was using real Kryptonite and that it was just too easy to come by. The team rang into a snag when they find the government was using it to create meta-humans that are infused with K, including a doomsday like creature. After defeating them, Superman finds the head of LexCorp, Lana Lang, has numerous stashes of the K around the world. Instead of handing it over, she blows it all up, creating a mist around the planet that doesn't hurt humans, but would kill Superman. Toyman comes into play and uses nano-bugs to clean the world up.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-181789\" href=\"/supermanbatman-the-search-for-kryptonite-the-search-for-kryptonite/4000-181789/\" slug=\"supermanbatman-the-search-for-kryptonite-the-search-for-kryptonite\">Superman/Batman: The Search for Kryptonite</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Edition</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-285231\" href=\"/batmansuperman-/4000-285231/\" slug=\"batmansuperman-\">Batman/Superman #24</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-285232\" href=\"/batmansuperman-/4000-285232/\" slug=\"batmansuperman-\">Batman/Superman #25</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-285233\" href=\"/batmansuperman-/4000-285233/\" slug=\"batmansuperman-\">Batman/Superman #26</a></li></ul>",

That is the first indication of Wanda´s greater power. Cap and Iron Man talk about her great power but not much later while walking with her brother she is shot made especially to kill her. It is later noticed that the bullet was made by Stark Enterprises.</p><p>Some place else Ultimate Alpha Flight arrived and seemingly kill Iceman and now the X-Men face these strange super powered team. Beast saves Iceman but Alpha Flight arrive to take Northstar, something that Colossus isn't very happy about. Alpha Flight was under the influence of a power enhancing drug called Banshee. Taking Northstar had Colossus mad so Dazzler, Nightcrawler, Rogue and him went after Alpha Flight. Cyclops went along to prevent anything stupid from happening. The Acolytes appeared into the picture and caused the death of Northstar. Colossus and the rest of the people who went along went under Banshee drug and enhanced their powers. Dazzler could maneuver her powers to create anything, Rogue could keep the power she absorbed, Nightcrawler could teleport further, Colossus became stronger, and Cyclops could control his optic blasts and was able to fly due to his entire body being able to channel solar energy.</p><p>Someplace else the FF where taken by SHIELD into Pegasus where SHIELD kept all unexplained objects that have been found around the world. Suddenly an artifact that had initially appeared when Steve Rogers became a super soldier activated.</p><p>Jean Grey had taken it into her own hands to lead the X-Men and she was driving them around pretty hard. Nightcrawler contacted her saying that they needed help from themselves because they were addicted to the power enhancer. Wolverine had figured out that he was positive to have been dosed with Banshee so he went to Peter Parker for help to sort things out. Kitty and Peter were dealing with Banshee addicts themselves when Wolverine arrived. Peter explained that Wolverine was positive because the drug was made by taking properties of him. The X-Men went after the addicted X-Men and fought it off. Jean went off for a moment while she talked to her father as Phoenix when then she fell unconscious.

While Wolverine uses some of the Banshee that Colossus bought to follow it back to it's creators, Jean finds Scott who tells her that he wants to keep the power, but the Banshee begins to wear off and he starts to lose control of his optic blasts, so Jean puts his glasses back on. Descovering that it was Charles Xavier who created Banshee from Wolverine's blood (though Magneto and Moira McTaggart helped) Wolverine was then attacked by Moira's sonic sceam, but managed to fight her off and destroyed the whole facility.

No longer a demon nor lord of hell nor angel of heaven above, he is but a normal man eating his omelet. It is here when he explains to Mazikeen, he has received a letter from God and because of this wishes to pay a visit to Meleos and ask him for a Six Card Spread. Meanwhile the Basano's warn Meleos of Lucifer's return to his shop.</p><p>Lucifer makes his way to the shop when a young prostitute offers him \"something abit fresher\", he than warns her of the impending death of her father. Whether or not he played a hand in it or not is unseen but what is seen in Lucifer entering the Meleo's shop and asking for a Six Card Spread. He then leaves and kills a bird for it's blood to play into the divination whilst Meleos prepares the cards for the Devil himself but soon he is wounded by their sheer power.</p><p>Meleos regains his strength whilst Lucifer has Mazikeen bleed on a few leaves as a part of a greater ritual. Later, Lucifer is than seen on the steps which Meleos is climbing, staring down at him for disobeying him. He explains he did'nt want to set them free, he wanted to kill them but they over-powered him. Lucifer's punishment for Meleos is all the ink that Meleos has written in book upon book runs. All his work is gone.</p><p>Lucifer and Mazikeen then head to a magic show they were invited to earlier, It is here when the Magicians assistant who has been both blessed and cursed by the cards performs a magic act the likes of which have never been seen. It is then when Lucifer sees the Lightbringer and has Mazikeen hit with a knife, it's later on when Lucifer creates \"The Void\", his own dimension.</p><h2>Collected Edition</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/lucifer-devil-in-the-gateway/4050-27649/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27649\">Lucifer: Devil in the Gateway</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/lucifer-1-knigha-1-d-iavol-u-porogha/4000-401857/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-401857\">Lucifer.

    "description": "<p>Bruce Wayne and Sasha Bordeaux are charged with the murder of Vesper Fairchild.  Without Batman leading the family, they are forced to work together to prove Bruce's innocence while trying desperately to keep their secret lives just that.  The investigation turns down a dark path as some evidence suggests that Vesper knew that Bruce Wayne was Batman, as evidence continues to pile against their mentor the Batman Family begin to have their doubts about whether or not Bruce Wayne did kill her.  Meanwhile Bruce Wayne struggles under the pressure of keeping up his appearance and not being his other persona, Batman.  Eventually Bruce has enough and escapes prison, denouncing his Bruce Wayne persona and choosing to fully embrace the Batman.  Before leaving a stunned Batman Family, Dick Grayson demands to know why he is doing this and if Bruce Wayne never existed then who raised him?  The two former partners come to blows and the arc ends with Batman leaving the Batcave and his Family behind as they don't know if he did the crime or not. <br/></p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-32113\" href=\"/batman-bruce-wayne-murderer/4050-32113/\" slug=\"batman-bruce-wayne-murderer\">Batman: Bruce Wayne-Murderer?</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Edition </h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284251\" href=\"/batman-/4000-284251/\" slug=\"batman-\">Batman #6</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<p> <br/>With Bruce Wayne now a fugitive and isolating himself from the Batman Family, the family continues to try to figure out what happened, but with every lead they get it continues to point back to Bruce.  Oracle and Black Canary gather a key lead in the case, however, as they learn that Vesper's journal as been altered, which could lead to the discovery that Bruce Wayne was framed.  Batgirl, also gathers a key piece to the puzzle, learning that Vesper was hit with a nerve strike before her death, possibly leading to clues that the body was staged.  Nightwing, Alfred and Robin learn that since the Earthquakes, new entrances into the caves are possible.  While re-enacting the murder Nightwing concludes that the Bruce Wayne he knows could never have committed this murder and switches everyone's focus on gathering evidence that will not compromise Bruce's Identity. <br/><br/>While this is going on Batman uncovers a plot to discredit and frame Bruce Wayne, headed by David Cain of Checkmate.  When Catwoman confronts him he soon learns that Bruce Wayne is a key component in his life and that although they may be criminals, he protects them from further injury because of his father's influence.  Batman soon is confronted by a Detective who was investigating Bruce's parents murders and informs the Batman that whatever happened to Bruce Wayne that night, it did not lead him to become commit murder because Bruce Wayne's life was defined by that murder.   <br/>He soon reestablishes connection to the Family, and they all meet in the Batcave for the first time in many months.  Bruce reveals that David Cain is behind these attempts hired by President Lex Luthor, to discredit Wayne after being embarrassed by him during and after the events of No Man's Land.  Cain figured out that Bruce Wayne was Batman and decided to take two birds with one stone.  The capture of Cain would subsequently clear Bruce Wayne's name. <br/></p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-32367\" href=\"/bruce-wayne-fugitive/4050-32367/\" slug=\"bruce-wayne-fugitive\">Bruce Wayne: Fugitive</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions </h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284253\" href=\"/batman-/4000-284253/\" slug=\"batman-\">Batman #8</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Spider-man is accused of a string of \"Spider-Tracer\" murders and is arrested and conivicted on Election Day.",
    "description": "<p>The Spider-Tracer killings have had a large political impact and mayoral candidates Bill Hollister and Randall Crowne are both determined to stop the murders in any way possible because the general public will back-up whoever does so. In any case, the general public is against Spider-Man and since Hollister is fully supporting the local police, his hope in winning the election lies in Spider-Man's capture, and the police are determined to take him down.</p><p>While attempting to escape from the police trailing him, Spider-Man is shot in the shoulder by a police marksman and although seriously injured, he manages to escape by crawling up an elevator shaft.</p><p>Meanwhile, NYPD crime scene investigator Carlie Cooper is given by her colleague at the department an electronic device that allows her to track down the Spider-Tracers that are found on the victims' bodies, hoping to lead her to the actual murderer.</p><p>Also, at Liberty Island, Harry Osborn proposes to his girlfriend Lily Hollister but Lily remains undecided and after receiving a call from her father, leaves Harry heartbroken and in the shadow of his Goblin past.</p><p>A bleeding and wounded Spider-Man manages to get to his appartment and enters the bathroom unseen just when a police officer comes in to inform Peter's roomate, police officer Vin Gonzales of something urgent. Then on, Carlie's tracking device leads her to Vin and Peter's appartment where she finds a bag full of spider-tracers under Vin's bed. Carlie confronts Vin about being the Spider-Tracer killer, and while they were talking, Peter overhears them mentioning that the Goblin villain known as Menace is attacking a Hollister Rally so, despite being injured, he donnes his costume and goes to fight Menace. However, because of his weakened state, Spider-Man is no match for the villain and he is badly beaten and left for the police who finally arrest him.</p><p>Menace then goes to the Hollister Headquaters where he starts experiencing some sorts of transformation, reverts to his alter-ego: Lily Hollister. While in this form, Harry enters the room and is shocked to discover that his girlfriend is Menace. It is revealed that Lily discovered of Harry's and his father's pasts as the Green Goblin while going through Harry's journals thinking he was using drugs. In an attempt to expose Norman as the Goblin so that her father would be seen as a hero and launch his career in politics, Lily goes to Oscorp for proof of Norman being the villain but while she was in Norman's secret lair, she was accidentally exposed to a new form of Goblin serum that Norman was working on, giving her super strength and the ability to shape-shift from her normal form to that of a Goblin at will. Lily also reveals that she was attacking her father's campaigne hoping he would gain public sympathy and a boost in votes. Also, she left Spider-Man to be arrested by the cops because it would increase Bill's chances of winning the election. Harry was shocked at the numerous revelations made by Lily, and was given yet another shock when Lily accepted his proposal,</p><p>Spider-Man is taken to the NYPD precinct and after he refuses to co-operate, Palone, the interrogator attempts to take his mask but he is stopped when Matt Murdock enters the precinct and declares that he will represent Spider-Man in court.</p><p>Carlie goes to the precinct and tells Palone of Vin's involvement in the Spider-Tracer killings. Then, Palone calls Vin and tells him that a warrant is issued for his and Carlie's arrest. Then Vin's partner arrests Vin for criminal conspiracy and takes him to the same prison Spider-Man is being kept in. Vin is put in general population with other violent inmates and Spider-Man fears for Vin's safety and tells Matt that the circumstances have changed.</p><p>On Election Day, at the trial, Spider-Man pleads not guilty and derails the trial. Matt then hands him a law book that contains a web-shooter he took from the evidence room. On Riker's Island, Vin is being brutally attacked by the other inmates in General Population until Spider-Man appears and saves him. They escape together and Vin tells Spider-Man about the Spider-Tracer conspiracy. Meanwhile, a terrified Carlie goes to the Hollisters' headquarters and tells Lily and her father that the NYPD is after her for a crime she did not commit. Bill and Lily are determined to help Carlie in any way because they consider her a part of their family and when the cops burst in, Lily secretly changes into Menace and attacks the cops to protect her best friend.</p><p>When Spider-Man hears of Menace's attack he quickly goes to stop her but because he is still in a weakened state, Spider-Man is defeated yet again. Before the killing blow is delivered to Spider-Man, Harry Osborn, wearing a Green Goblin costume and using a Goblin Glider appears and attempts to inject Menace with a special syringe but she manages to grab it. When the Green Goblin calls Menace Lily, Peter realizes that the two Goblins in front of him are Harry and Lily so he takes the syringe and injects Lily with it in the neck, causing her to transform back to her human form. She is then arrested by thepolice and Spider-Man is brought to the safety of a rooftop by Harry.</p><p>The whole encounter was shown on television and upon discovering that his own daughter is a criminal, a distraught Bill Hollister, despite being declared the winner of the election, resigns from his post as Mayor. Vin meets up with Carlie and tells her that he will fix things for both of them and goes to arrest the cops involved in the Spider-Tracer conspiracy.</p><p>In the Epilogue, Peter and Harry talk about Lily at the Coffe Bean and Harry wonders what he will do now that Lily is insane because despite everything he really loved her. Elsewhere Lily is visited by Norman Osborn who consoles her and welcomes her to the Osborn Family.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-31754\" href=\"/spider-man-election-day/4050-31754/\" slug=\"spider-man-election-day\">Spider-Man: Election Day</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-245819\" href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-menace-revealed/4000-245819/\" slug=\"the-astonishing-spider-man-menace-revealed\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #24</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-297095\" href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-297095/\" slug=\"the-astonishing-spider-man-\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #25</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Event where Spider-Man was super-heroing in different costumes.",
    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br/></h2>When Spider-Man was wanted for murder and he had a 5 million bounty on his head, he decided it would be best if he stopped being Spider-Man, and so created 4 new identities. Thus four new heroes were born: Dusk, Ricochet, Prodigy and Hornet. Each identity represented a different aspect of Spider-Man's identity. The reason he had four identities was so that if any of them got exposed, he would have another three to fall back on. This was also done so that he'd have a different identity for each of the four Spider-Man volumes at the time. After he cleared his name, the identities were revived in the form of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43529\" href=\"/slingers/4060-43529/\" slug=\"slingers\">                              Slingers</a>.  <br/><h2>Hornet<br/></h2>The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4803\" href=\"/hornet/4005-4803/\" slug=\"hornet\">                          Hornet</a> identity was used in the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-5788\" href=\"/the-sensational-spider-man/4050-5788/\" slug=\"the-sensational-spider-man\">                       Sensational Spider-Man</a> book. It represented the smart, geeky side of Peter Parker. It used a jetpack designed and invented by Hobie Brown, a.k.a. the<a data-ref-id=\"4005-14874\" href=\"/prowler/4005-14874/\" slug=\"prowler\">                             Prowler</a>, as well as sedative darts. <br/> <br/>The Hornet made his debut stopping the<a data-ref-id=\"4005-6297\" href=\"/looter/4005-6297/\" slug=\"looter\">                            Looter</a> from stealing the $5 million reward which was for the capture of Spider-Man. Despite the Looter's superior strength, he managed to shoot him with some sedative darts, knocking him out. Following this, Hornet was briefly interviewed by the media. When asked if he was in New York to stop Spider-Man, the Hornet replied \"I don't think you'll have to worry about Spider-Man any more.\"  <br/> <br/>Unfortunately for Peter, this remark was misinterpreted by several people: the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\" href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" slug=\"human-torch\">                      Human Torch</a> confronted Hornet and warned him that if he'd done anything to Spider-Man, he'd pay. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4459\" href=\"/vulture/4005-4459/\" slug=\"vulture\">                     Vulture</a>, wanting revenge on Spider-Man, also assumed that Hornet had killed him, and so attacked Hornet. During the fight, he recognised Spider-Man's fighting style and taunts, and so exposed him to the media as Spider-Man. Peter was forced to give up his Hornet identity. <br/>The Hornet identity was later used by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4803\" href=\"/hornet/4005-4803/\" slug=\"hornet\">                         Eddie McDonough</a>.<br/><h2>Ricochet<br/></h2>The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2245\" href=\"/ricochet/4005-2245/\" slug=\"ricochet\">                        Ricochet </a>identity was used in the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2127\" href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man/4050-2127/\" slug=\"the-amazing-spider-man\">                    Amazing Spider-Man</a> book. Ricochet represented the funny, joking side of Peter Parker. The identity used Peter's athletic abilities and acrobatics, as well as some discs which could ricochet wildly when thrown. <br/> <br/>In his Ricochet identity, Peter tried to take down the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8669\" href=\"/black-tarantula/4005-8669/\" slug=\"black-tarantula\">                   Black Tarantula</a>, who he had recently fought as Spider-Man. Ricochet pretended to be a criminal, wanting to make money, and in the process took out some of Black Tarantula's men. He was then attacked by<a data-ref-id=\"4005-9856\" href=\"/delilah/4005-9856/\" slug=\"delilah\">                   Delilah</a>, an assassin of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58537\" href=\"/rose/4005-58537/\" slug=\"rose\">                 Rose</a>, who also wanted to take out the Black Tarantula. After a fight with Delilah, she deemed that he had the necessary skills to help her fight the Black Tarantula, and so asked him if he wanted to join her. Peter reluctantly accepted. <br/> <br/>Ricochet and Delilah later found two operatives of the Black Tarantula, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15731\" href=\"/roughouse/4005-15731/\" slug=\"roughouse\">                Roughouse</a> and<a data-ref-id=\"4005-15734\" href=\"/bloodscream/4005-15734/\" slug=\"bloodscream\">                Bloodscream</a>. Delilah and Ricochet attacked them, but in the process Delilah was badly injured by Bloodscream. Ricochet then attacked Roughouse and Bloodscream at their hideout, a boat, on his own, and switched between his different identities during the fight so that he could practise the different fighting styles. After defeating both of them, Bloodscream revealed to Ricochet that they had been hired to take out a certain person, and in return for their freedom, gave Ricochet a picture of Mary Jane and her friends. (This plot was continued in the following Amazing Spider-Man issues).  <br/>The Ricochet identity was later used by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2245\" href=\"/ricochet/4005-2245/\" slug=\"ricochet\">              Johnny Gallo</a>.<br/><h2>Dusk<br/></h2>The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4805\" href=\"/dusk/4005-4805/\" slug=\"dusk\">             Dusk </a>identity was used in the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-4421\" href=\"/spider-man/4050-4421/\" slug=\"spider-man\">            Spider-Man</a> book. Dusk represented the mystery that came with being a super-hero. Using a costume which he obtained in the Negative Zone, Dusk was able to blend in and out of shadows, making it seem as though he could turn invisible. <br/> <br/>At the suggestion of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13737\" href=\"/arthur-stacy/4005-13737/\" slug=\"arthur-stacy\">           Arthur Stacy</a>, Dusk befriended the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\" href=\"/trapster/4005-4328/\" slug=\"trapster\">          Trapster</a>, the man who had framed Spider-Man for murder. In order to stop Trapster from telling anyone that he had framed Spider-Man, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\" href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" slug=\"norman-osborn\">         Norman Osborn</a> had put a price on the Trapster's head. Dusk managed to save Trapster from an attack by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4825\" href=\"/shocker/4005-4825/\" slug=\"shocker\">        Shocker</a>, and so gained his trust in the process. He said that his reason for helping Trapster was because he had also been used by Norman Osborn. Dusk then started hanging out with Trapster, in order to try and get some evidence showing that he had framed Spider-Man.<br/>  <br/>Arthur Stacy later provided Dusk with a tape recorder to try and get a confession out of Trapster. That night, Trapster took Dusk to go and kill Norman Osborn, in revenge for using him. Dusk managed to stop Trapster from killing Norman, as he didn't want to be an accessory to murder, but destroyed his tape recorder (which had Norman admitting he had hired Trapster to frame Spider-Man) in the process. Dusk then convinced Trapster to confess in court to the framing, so that Norman's life would be hell. Trapster did so, and so this partly cleared Spider-Man's name.<br/>The Dusk identity was later used by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4805\" href=\"/dusk/4005-4805/\" slug=\"dusk\">       Cassie St. Commons</a>. <br/><h2>Prodigy<br/></h2>The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4804\" href=\"/prodigy/4005-4804/\" slug=\"prodigy\">      Prodigy</a> identity was used in the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2870\" href=\"/the-spectacular-spider-man/4050-2870/\" slug=\"the-spectacular-spider-man\">     Spectacular Spider-Man</a> book. Prodigy represented the traditional super hero. In his Prodigy identity, Peter used his super-strength to leap long distances (which looked like flying to viewers) and wore a bulletproof costume. <br/> <br/>Prodigy managed to stop some men who had been hired by a man named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23583\" href=\"/conundrum/4005-23583/\" slug=\"conundrum\">    Conundrum </a>from capturing the ambassador of a fictional Middle East country. However, this turned out to be a ruse by Conundrum, as his real target was the ambassador's daughter. He said he'd only return her if he was given the Hand of Mumthazi, a treasure said to possess infinite powers. Unfortunately, the Hand had been stolen by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40901\" href=\"/jack-olantern/4005-40901/\" slug=\"jack-olantern\">   Jack o' Lantern</a>, who wanted the ambassador's daughter for reasons of his own. Whilst he and Conundrum fought, Prodigy burst in on both of them, only for them to team up to try and stop them. <br/> <br/>Although Prodigy was almost defeated by both of them, he managed to stop them using his spider-sense to see past their illusions. However, when freeing the ambassador's daughter, he was attacked by Jack o' Lantern, who still wanted the girl. Before he could do anything, Jack was shot by Norman Osborn,  who had arrived on the scene. At a press conference later, Prodigy produced a Spider-Man costume, and claimed that either Jack o' Lantern or Conundrum had recently attacked Norman Osborn. The public accepted this, and so Spider-Man's named was cleared, letting Peter resume his normal identity.<br/> <br/>It was later revealed that Norman Osborn had hired Jack o' Lantern to steal the Hand, so that he could save the ambassador's daughter and thus they would owe him a great debt. <br/> The Prodigy identity was later used by<a data-ref-id=\"4005-4804\" href=\"/prodigy/4005-4804/\" slug=\"prodigy\">   Ritchie Gilmore</a>.",

But in return, Norman asks Crowne to use his contacts to arrange for the Thunderbolts to come to New York and hunt Spider-Man. First, he sent the team after the man who takes pictures of his long-time foe...Peter Parker. The Thunderbolts attacked Peter and attempt to force him into telling them where Spider-Man is. After he refused to co-operate, they ruined his appartment and left him with a warning. Norman also checked on his son Harry, who has bought the Coffee Bean, hoping to make it into a franchise, but this did not impress Norman at all.</p><p>Eventually, the Thunderbolts engaged Spider-Man and Eddie Brock got involved and has become Anti-Venom. As Norman watches the battle between Venom, Anti-Venom and Spider-Man, he is attacked and threatened by the new goblin, Menace, who tells him to stop interfering in politics and leave town, but Norman tells him that he's only interested in Spider-Man, angering Menace further, but Osborn defeated Menace by using a self-destruct mechanism on Menace's glider, which originally belonged to Osborn. After the battle which ended with the Venom symbiote badl injured, Osborn noticed Peter's camera, and re-engineered its homing device, allowing him to track Spider-Man's movement and location. He used this programming to form a special kind of tracer-bullets that only hits Spider-Man. He sent Bullseye and a group of Thunderbolts soldiers to capture the Wall Crawler but they failed.</p><p>Osborn also cured Gargan and his symbiote by building him a new special Scorpion suit armed with a very powerful poison able to kill Anti-Venom, derived from the villain Freak. When Spidey and Anti-Venom made their way to Oscorp, Gargan attacked and the poison proved to be effective against Anti-Venom, temporarily defeating him. As Spider-Man made his way to the main office, Osborn was now wearing his Green Goblin costume and ready to fight Spider-Man. A fight ensued with Spidey having the upper edge but stopped himself from finishing Norman off when the Goblin revealed that he had people hooked up to machines. As Spidey rushed to save those people, Osborn used the building's self-destruct mechanism. As the building crumbled, Spidey saved the people and Norman managed to escape. He was then seen giving a public speech and was still seen as a hero to the public.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-31703\" href=\"/spider-man-new-ways-to-die/4050-31703/\" slug=\"spider-man-new-ways-to-die\">Spider-Man: New Ways To Die</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-297091\" href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-297091/\" slug=\"the-astonishing-spider-man-\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #14</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-297092\" href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-297092/\" slug=\"the-astonishing-spider-man-\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #15</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-297093\" href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-297093/\" slug=\"the-astonishing-spider-man-\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #16</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>The Days of Future Present is a crossover that occurred in several annuals in 1990.</p><h2>Plot Summary</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\" href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" slug=\"franklin-richards\">Franklin Richards</a> is supposed to be a young boy at this point in the mainstream Marvel Universe. Yet, it seems as if an older Franklin has somehow appeared. With this revelation begins the Days of Future Present, a mystery of who's who and what's what.</p><p>In Franklin's future, the mutants are hunted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14687\" href=\"/ahab/4005-14687/\" slug=\"ahab\">Ahab</a> and his hounds so as to allow the humans to rule the planet. During a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\" href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" slug=\"sentinels\">Sentinel</a> attack, Franklin is killed but sends a dream self into the past. There he feeds off the powers of his younger self, as well as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\" href=\"/rachel-grey/4005-3566/\" slug=\"rachel-grey\">Rachel Summers</a>, a past girlfriend. His presence also awakens Ahab, a man who sleeps on the border of here and now; a gatekeeper of realities; someone who wants to keep the future as it is. Ahab releases futuristic drones and Sentinels in an attempt to quell any adverse effects older Franklin's presence will have on the present and future.</p><p>The future Franklin does not understand that he is a dream version of himself and tries to manifest things to be as he remembered them. He transforms the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42378\" href=\"/four-freedoms-plaza/4020-42378/\" slug=\"four-freedoms-plaza\">Four Freedoms Plaza</a> back to the old <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\" href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" slug=\"baxter-building\">Baxter Building</a>, makes X-Factor's <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28848\" href=\"/ship/4005-28848/\" slug=\"ship\">Ship</a> vanish, and reconstructs <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" slug=\"xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\">Xavier's Mansion</a>, all are acts that alert various groups to Franklin's presence. These teams, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\" href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" slug=\"fantastic-four\">Fantastic Four</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\" href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" slug=\"x-factor\">X-Factor</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" slug=\"x-men\">X-Men</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\" href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" slug=\"new-mutants\">New Mutants</a>, must band together to figure out the mystery of the future Franklin. They must also thwart the odd machinations of Ahab, as he in turn wants a piece of older Franklin.</p><p>During the fighting, younger and older Franklin see the awesome destruction that is possible if Franklin is allowed to keep his powers. They decide to lock younger Franklin's potential inside so that all power is inhibited, thereby eradicating the older Franklin's future of Sentinel enforced human dominance from the timelines.</p><p>Ahab captures <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\" href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" slug=\"invisible-woman\">Sue Storm</a> and turns them into his hounds, a process that \"permanently\" changes their DNA. They hunt down older Franklin, Rachel Summers (his girlfriend), and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\" href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" slug=\"cable\">Christopher Summers</a>, whom Franklin had stolen from Cyclops in an effort to get Rachel some acceptance.</p><p>In the end, Ahab is thwarted, the dream Franklin dissipates, Rachel uses the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\" href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" slug=\"phoenix-force\">Phoenix Force</a> to reconstruct the DNA of Cyclops and Sue Storm, and each team is able to return to their respective corners of the universe.</p><h2>Effects</h2><h3>The Fantastic Four</h3><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\" href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" slug=\"mr-fantastic\">Mr. Fantastic</a> and Sue Storm get to see their son grown up. They must also come to grips with the fact that, according to this particular timeline, Franklin dies in a future far more bleak than they had imagined. Younger Franklin's powers are released before the dream Franklin departs, but the boy now has a look at what his powers will be capable of performing.</p><h3>The X-Men</h3><p>The slow trickle of X-Men returning is seen and a new face, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\" href=\"/gambit/4005-1499/\" slug=\"gambit\">Gambit</a>, is introduced.</p><h3>The New Mutants</h3><p>At one point, older Franklin returns to Xavier's school. There he dreams up his old classmates, the future's version of the New Mutants. This version stumbles upon Cable's New Mutants. Franklin's team appears to have a mutant who resembles <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\" href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" slug=\"cypher\">Doug Ramsey</a>, an old teammate of many of the current New Mutants. Not only does this foreshadow a possible resurrection of this character, but the New Mutants must watch their friend be taken away again when Franklin makes his team disappear.</p><h3>X-Factor</h3><p>Rachel Summers comes face to face with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a> after a confrontation with older Franklin. Rachel finally admits that she is Jean's daughter from the future. Jean and, to an extent, Cyclops, have a hard time accepting this news. Rachel must deal with her emotions of being rejected while Christopher, her kind-of half-brother, is fully accepted by both parents. The story ends with Jean contemplating where her feelings towards Rachel really lie.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-315540\" href=\"/essential-x-factor-volume-four/4000-315540/\" slug=\"essential-x-factor-volume-four\">Essential X-Factor #4</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-323368\" href=\"/essential-x-men-volume-10/4000-323368/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-volume-10\">Essential X-Men #10</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-43792\" href=\"/x-men-days-of-future-present/4050-43792/\" slug=\"x-men-days-of-future-present\">X-Men: Days of Future Present</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Edition</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-264040\" href=\"/essential-x-men-/4000-264040/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-\">Essential X-Men #4</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-264041\" href=\"/essential-x-men-/4000-264041/\" slug=\"essential-x-men-\">Essential X-Men #5</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Batman: The Dark Knight Returns is a Batman comic book mini-series written and drawn by Frank Miller and published by DC Comics from February to June 1986. This story arc is set 20 years into the future, where Bruce Wayne is an elderly man still guilt-ridden over Jason Todd's death.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The Dark Knight Returns is set ten years in an alternate future, with a worn and weary, aged Bruce Wayne. He numbs his conscience with alcohol to soothe the guilt he feels for his responsibility for the death of <a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd</a>. <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a> is under siege by a vicious criminal gang who call themselves the Mutants. Wayne unleashes his demons to confront the new threats to Gotham, and Batman is born again. Wayne finds himself struggling with the decline of his physique as he patrols and defends Gotham City. An inexperienced but courageous young girl named <a href=\"/carrie-kelly/4005-13164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13164\">Carrie Kelly</a> saves Batman´s life, and Wayne takes her in as a new <a href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\">Robin</a>.</p><p>Batman is seen now as a menace to Gotham´s society and an anti-vigilantism wave is carried on from the government. Even <a href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Commissioner Gordon</a> became a victim of both, criminals and government as well after he killed a teenager in self-defense. He is replaced by Ellen Yindel, a well known anti-vigilante cop. Batman found out how the mutants gained their power and their high-tech weaponry - discovering a net of corruption inside the U.S. Army. Defeating most of the mutants, Batman faces the leader, however his advanced age became a disadvantage for him as is eventually incapacitated by the mutant leader. Fortunately, <a href=\"/carrie-kelly/4005-13164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13164\">Carrie Kelly</a> appears and rescues Batman, getting him the Batmobile. After initially mistaking him for <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson</a>, Batman confirms Kelly as the third Robin. After his recovery, Batman and Robin lure the Mutants to a sewer dump (\"the pipe), where Batman defeats the Mutant leader (released from prison by Commissioner Gordon) in hand-to-hand combat, effectively breaking the gang.</p><p>During the time Batman was gone, the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a> entered a state of catatonia, being unable to find something to live for. After Batman´s reappearance, the Joker woke up and convinced Dr. Wolper that he has been rehabilitated. When Wolper takes the Joker to a talk show, he begins a killing spree releasing his joker venom to the audience and kills Wolper as well. Batman appears to stop him, however the Joker escapes due to the fact that Batman had to struggle with the police. Batman and Robin began to search for the Joker, after he killed a group of boy scouts and Robin avoids more deaths after the Joker planted a bomb in a roller coaster. Batman paralyzes the Joker and faces a dilemma on whether if he should kill him or not. The Joker laughs and calls Batman a coward, he then snaps his own neck to blame Batman for his death.</p><p><a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> is called by the U.S. government to stop Batman after he returns from a mission in South America. A lethal group known as the Sons of Batman have been using deadly methods against criminals. Batman and Robin decides to train them to use non-lethal methods. During this time, <a href=\"/green-arrow/4005-5936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\">Oliver Queen</a>, formerly known as the Green Arrow, warns Bruce about Superman and the government plans. Batman eventually faces off Superman in crime alley. After a rough battle, Bruce seemingly gains the upper hand thanks to his prior preparation and Oliver's kryptonite arrow. With Superman knocked out by the effect of the kryptonite, Wayne lays down a final monologue on Superman regarding how he is \"the one man who beat him\". After that, he tricks Superman into believing he suffered a heart attack in order to be able to escape the government. Clark goes to Bruce's funeral where he hears a heart beat inside the coffin, and winks at Carrie. He then realizes that Wayne faked his own death. After this event, Wayne begins a new life with his \"army\": Robin and Green Arrow.</p><p><b>The Dark Knight Returns helped to re-define <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> and portray the character as he was originally conceived during the 1930's.</b></p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/absolute-dark-knight/4050-22760/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22760\">Absolute Dark Knight</a></li><li><a href=\"/batman-the-dark-knight-returns/4050-38859/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38859\">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-complete-frank-miller-batman/4050-38517/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38517\">The Complete Frank Miller Batman</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/millennium-edition-batman-the-dark-knight-returns-book-one/4050-32751/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32751\">Millennium Edition: Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/laderlappen-den-ateruppstandne/4000-258544/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-258544\">Läderlappen #198701</a></li><li><a href=\"/laderlappen-den-segrande/4000-258936/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-258936\">Läderlappen #198702</a></li><li><a href=\"/laderlappen-den-jagade/4000-259060/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-259060\">Läderlappen #198703</a></li><li><a href=\"/laderlappen-den-fallne/4000-259260/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-259260\">Läderlappen #198704</a></li></ul>",

Ronin refuses to stand for it and says that the true Avengers are going to get back at them for this.</p><p>Tony Stark is now seen as a coward and is hated by the public. His <a href=\"/iron-man-extremis/4050-30846/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30846\">Extremis</a> powers begin to fade and he becomes weaker. His company is handed over to Osborn, as well as his suits of armor.

Bullseye without question became Hawkeye, Ares and Sentry went along with Osborn and when Ms. Marvel was asked to join she refused. Moonstone then became the new Ms. Marvel, Wolverine's son Daken took his fathers role, Venom was given some kind of medicine to have him look normal insted of a hulkish monster and Noh-Varr took the role of Captain Marvel instead of Marvel Boy. Finally Osborn needed somekind of symbol to replace Captain America and Iron Man all together making himself the alter ego of the Iron Patriot. Osborn with the help of Ghost hacked into Iron Man's vault to gain acces to all of the Iron Man armors and create himself the Iron Patriot armor. During all this Osborn was being watched and Doctor Doom was confronted in Latveria by a mysterious woman using magic, who later was revealed to be Morgan Le Fay.</p><p>Seeking vengence on Dr. Doom, Morgan le Fay attacks Dr. Doom on the rubble of his kingdom. Doom then calls the dark avengers. Osborn realized he needs to protect his ally, Osborn goes with his newly formed Dark avengers on their first mission, saving Doom. During the battle, Sentry rips off Morgan Le Fay's head. Thinking they've won, the dark avengers are about to leave when she returns with more mosters. Doom tells Osborn the only way to stop her is to go back to the past where she is. With the help of Doom, Osborn goes back in time to stop Morgan le Fay in her time period.</p><p>Having stopped Morgan Le Fay, they head off home when suddenly a bright light appears. The Sentry has returned. But he was corrupted by his dark half, the Void. Osborn convinces him to stop. He then understands and heads to see his wife.</p><p>When some of the graduates at Camp Hammond are assigned to different teams, Baron Von Blitzschlag encounters Ragnarok, the cyborg Thor-clone, which is reactivated by a failsafe programmed by Criti Noll (which requires his access code to keep him contained). The Thor clone kills the Baron within a couple of minutes and is then attacked by Thor Girl, whom he defeats after a long and heavy fight above Camp Hammond. Trauma then poses as the real Thor to catch him off guard, which fails. Reserve member Gorilla Girl then takes on the clone. Just as she is about to lose, Counter Force (of the former New Warriors) appear to fight.</p><p>Due to War Machine's recent injuries, Bethany Cabe is currently working with him and appears to have developed a clone body, called \"James Rhodes 2.0\", for him to take over. However, the clone body is discovered by Norman Osborn.</p><p>Following the Skrull defeat and the rise of Norman Osborn to power, the Agents of Atlas decide to oppose Osborn's agenda by taking on the role of \"supervillains\". Their first act is to attack Fort Knox and steal from the gold reserve, which Osborn planned on using to finance a secret weapons system.</p><p>After fighting off Tiger Shark (who alongside Bob, Agent of HYDRA was hired by Norman Osborn to kill him and retrieve his head), Deadpool and Bob discuss the current events Deadpool missed while being hunted by Tiger Shark. When Deadpool hears that Norman was the one who killed the Skrull Queen, he puts two and two together about who stole the data Deadpool got from the Skrulls during the Invasion. Knowing it was supposed to be Nick Fury who got the information to kill the Skrull Queen, Deadpool sends a letter to Norman asking for 100 million dollars in hush money to keep Deadpool from ruining Osborn's heroic outlook. When Deadpool comes to Stark Tower to collect his pay, he is attacked by the Thunderbolts. However with the help of Taskmaster, he is able to fight off the Thunderbolts. Unfortunately he walks away empty-handed. When Norman goes on television for an interview he is interupted by footage of Deadpool who makes fun of Norman behind the scenes. Norman is getting sick of Deadpool so he sends Bullseye off on a mission to kill him, however Deadpool wins the fight between the two and Bullseye reveals that Norman has agreed to pay Deadpool off in order to keep him quiet. Deadpool accepts and is paid (However the money actually came from Bullseye's own savings) , which leads to him becoming so bored that he shoots himself in the head.</p><p>After Loki resurrects Bor, the father of Odin and sets him loose on New York City, Thor flies to intervene and tries to reason with Bor. This fails and the two mark up in battle, which Thor barely survives. He lets out a call for the Avengers, but the Dark Avengers arrive and attack both gods. After a long fight, Thor decides to end it permanently and the two gods attack each other in a last attack. Thor rises up victorious, but Loki and Balder appear and tell Thor that he was fighting Odin's father and that the punishment for killing him is permanent banishment from Asgard for all of eternity. After Thor leaves, Loki is seen convincing the disgruntled Asgardians to move their home to Latveria.</p><p>After realizing who the Dark Avengers really are, they send Spider-Woman to trick Osborn into leading his team into a trap, at the abandoned Hellfire Club Mansion, where they can de-power and fight them more fairly. However, Osborn realizes their plot and sends the Hood and his criminals to eliminate them. They manage to barely escape by Spider-Woman focusing her power through Ms. Marvel. After this, Ronin goes on live television, addressing the country that they seem to have forgotten that Osborn was a murderer, and that he was in league with the Hood and he and his \"New Avengers\" cannot be trusted.</p><p><a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a> and <a href=\"/stature/4005-40516/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40516\">Stature</a> are on the ruins of the Avengers statue memory lane. There a new statue appeared showing the death of Wasp. Suprisingly they see statues of the <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a> there too they notice that they have been cover in somekind of goo making super heroes into statues. They flee from this and see the unexpected, the woman who Vision loves and who killed Cassie Langs father, the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a>, but before any of the three can say anything Wanda teleports them out of trouble.</p><p>She then scours the globe and recolects U.S. Agent out of battle, and Hulk out of being frozen. Iron Man had some trouble at Stark Enterprises and Jarvis and Hercules met up surprised that a whole state was gone. They went to Hank Pym for help to lead the new team of Avengers but he denied because he was afraid to lead the team. Scarlet Witch went to him and told him that he was needed for the team to be complete and that all he had to do was summon his team that she had arranged for him.</p><p>Later by the words AVENGERS ASSEMBLE spoken by <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a>, now Wasp, and the help of the Scarlet Witch's powers the new Mighty Avengers are summoned: Vison, Stature, <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>, <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Jarvis</a>, Scarlet Witch, <a href=\"/jocasta/4005-3318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3318\">Jocasta</a> and <a href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\">U.S. Agent.</a> .</p><p>Elswhere, Norman Osborn is trying to create a great team dynamic. That resemble the classic Avengers. So, he convinces Ares God of War alternate version of Thor and the Sentry. Carol Danvers then arrives in Avengers Tower. Only to see Norman Osbon pouring a drink. He invites her to lead the new team of Avengers, but she denies. Because, he is a psychopath. Norman states that if she does not join, she will be held under arrest. For becoming an \"outlaw\". Ares and Sentry appear. She begins to have an upsetting notion. How could they help him? Ares said that Carol was putting her ego ahead of what is right. Sentry tells Carol that Norman is helping him. Carol begins to cry, and flies out the window. In which she becomes a full member to the New Avengers. Norman says \"She'll be back. Until then there are a lot of Ms. Marvels out there.\"</p><p>The group comes into conflicts with them almost hating each other, and to add to their tension, when Osborn made up his X-Men team, and Daken was placed on there as Wolverine. This new X-men team is composed of <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a> posing as Professor Xavier, <a href=\"/michael-pointer/4005-7600/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7600\">Weapon Omega</a>, <a href=\"/mimic/4005-12546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12546\">Mimic</a>, <a href=\"/dark-beast/4005-3422/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3422\">Dark Beast</a>, Namor, <a href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\">Cloak</a>, <a href=\"/dagger/4005-1935/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1935\">Dagger</a> and leading them is Emma Frost. All this in the events of <a href=\"/utopia/4045-55905/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55905\">Utopia</a></p><p>Osborn's Cabal then is shortened from 6 members to 4. Emma Frost led a betrayal on Osborn against the <a href=\"/dark-x-men/4060-56445/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56445\">Dark X-Men</a>, with Namor assisting her. Now the Dark Avengers team is only composed of Weapon Omega, Mimic, Dark Beast and Mystique leading them posing as Jean Grey.</p><p>These events take Osborn to the next level.
