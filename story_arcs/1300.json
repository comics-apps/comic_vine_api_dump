    "description": "<p>Takes place 17 months after the end of the much longer and more complex <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56251\" href=\"/arrancar-saga/4045-56251/\" slug=\"arrancar-saga\">Arrancar Saga</a>. The Tale of the Lost Agent is a transitory arc much smaller in scale and scope than many of those that preceded it, and the style of it expresses this change: gone are most of big bombastic battles and otherworldly environments, sobstituted by quirky Urban Fantasy's settings and a more grounded feel. Together with this, the majority of the \"old\" cast is put on the background in favor of an entire group of new additions.</p><p>This all changes by the end of the arc, where in full glory they make a comeback the larger than life conflicts, the ultradesigned characters, the transformations, as well as the old guard, while the newer characters are almost entirely removed. For these reasons, some fans ended up complaining that the overall arc felt like \"canonic-filler\", irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, just an excuse to give back Ichigo his powers in time for the beginning of the \"Thousand-Year Blood War\", the true climax of the manga.</p>",

    "description": "<p>At this point <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41978\" href=\"/cybertron/4020-41978/\" slug=\"cybertron\">Cybertron</a>'s once strong and advance civilization is now in a time of equilibrium. Cybertron is ruled by the High Council who ignore the rule of no underground gladiator battles. One of these might gladiators is one who names himself after one of the thirteen primes, the mighty Megateonus. Later on after being so popular he shortens it to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4103\" href=\"/megatron/4005-4103/\" slug=\"megatron\">Megatron</a>.</p><p>At this time Orion Pax, a data clerk thinking that there is something wrong with Cybertron's Caste System, is assigned to eavesdrop on Megatron's political speeches and report it back to the High Council. When listening to Megatron's speeches Orion is very interested. Confused on how Megatron is thought as an enemy by the High Council he goes to see the last of the living Original 13, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55797\" href=\"/alpha-trion/4005-55797/\" slug=\"alpha-trion\">Alpha Trion</a> and is anware by the other Cybertronians. Reading the scribe of past, present and future Alpha Trion tells Orion Pax of a great destiny that waits he and Megatron but doesn't know what. Alpha Trion tells Orion Pax to watch his new upstart.</p><p>Orion hesitantley joins Megatron's new organization, while in this new organization he enjoys breaking the rules. The two agree that the time has come to form a new Cybertronian government. Megatron thinks this should happen by confrontation, while Orion wants to start this my inspiring others to help change the gaovernment from within. Megatron later adds to his team <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7405\" href=\"/soundwave/4005-7405/\" slug=\"soundwave\">Soundwave</a> with his army of Minicons and the scientist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12207\" href=\"/shockwave/4005-12207/\" slug=\"shockwave\">Shockwave</a>.</p><p>When Orion after having a dispute with Megatron, he resigns as being part of Megatron's Organization and soon is viewed as a revolutionary. As Megatron's forces grow more powerful they also begin to grow more deadly by commiting multiple bombings throughout the planet. Later with cooperation with Seeker bodygaurds he kidnaps <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57651\" href=\"/sentinel-prime/4005-57651/\" slug=\"sentinel-prime\">Sentinel Prime</a>.</p><p>One of the Seekers, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7402\" href=\"/starscream/4005-7402/\" slug=\"starscream\">Starscream</a> is disgusted by the cowardness Sentinel shows during the kidnapping. He tells Megatron that who wants to join him about the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41911\" href=\"/trypticon/4005-41911/\" slug=\"trypticon\">Trypticon</a> Station in which Starscream nows about and Megatron does not.</p><p>Hoping this won't start a wore Orion Pax and Megatron have a meeting with the High Council. The Council view Megatron as nothing more than a criminal. Megatron during the dispute has named his new organization the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40490\" href=\"/decepticons/4060-40490/\" slug=\"decepticons\">Decepticons</a>. When it is Orion's turn to speak he is more noble and compare's this event when the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55924\" href=\"/quintessons/4060-55924/\" slug=\"quintessons\">Quintesson</a>'s invaded Cybertron along time ago. He proclaims all Cybertronians have fuller potential in life and should be called autonomous robots or <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40489\" href=\"/autobots/4060-40489/\" slug=\"autobots\">Autobots</a> for short. At last one of the Council members Halogen speak and say that Orion and Megatron are right and Cybertron should begin a social rebirth. Halogen declares a new leader is needed in which he tells Orion Pax he will now be called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6467\" href=\"/optimus-prime/4005-6467/\" slug=\"optimus-prime\">Optimus Prime</a> and his first mission is to retrieve the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55759\" href=\"/matrix-of-leadership/4055-55759/\" slug=\"matrix-of-leadership\">Matrix of Leadership</a>.</p><p>Believing this has been a set up by Orion all along Megatron kills Halogen, but as both sides ready for war Optimus convinces Megatron to stop in which he declines. Instead the two sides retreat and the High Counclil members Contrail and Ratbat align with the Decepticons.</p><p>During the war Optimus declares the Autobot capital Iacon, a small part of Cybertron and the Decepticons take most of Cybertrons land and create a capital of thier own called Kraon. An autobot special team called <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55899\" href=\"/wreckers/4060-55899/\" slug=\"wreckers\">The Wreckers</a> led by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41901\" href=\"/ultra-magnus/4005-41901/\" slug=\"ultra-magnus\">Ultra Magnus</a> manage to stand thier own with the Decepticon combiner <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11891\" href=\"/devastator/4005-11891/\" slug=\"devastator\">Devastator</a>. Out of desperation the Autobots launch the sacred <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55659\" href=\"/allspark/4055-55659/\" slug=\"allspark\">AllSpark</a> into space to not let Megatron gain control of Cybertronian life. . During this battle Megatron who tries to get information to the location of the Allspark from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30511\" href=\"/bumblebee/4005-30511/\" slug=\"bumblebee\">Bumblebee</a> fails and destroys his vocal cords.</p><p>Megatron creates a new strategy and orders Starscream to take him to Trypticon where there is a stockpile of Dark <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55730\" href=\"/energon/4055-55730/\" slug=\"energon\">Energon</a> which is from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40496\" href=\"/unicron/4005-40496/\" slug=\"unicron\">Unicron</a> himself. Megatron then gets two keys of Justice and Power to open the Plasma Energy Chamber which he plans to dump all the dark energon in to starve the Autobots. The one of the keys were hidden in Sentinel's chest who Megatron killed in combat by ripping him in pieces.</p><p>Before Megatron can activate the Chamber, Teletraan- 1 awakens Cybertron's ultimate guardian, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30486\" href=\"/omega-supreme/4005-30486/\" slug=\"omega-supreme\">Omega Supreme</a>. Transforming from city mode to rocket mode he crushes Megatron and his Decepticon forces. All seems hopeful till Starscream and his Seekers show him and shoot down Omega Supreme in which he lands creating a huge crater. Autobot Medic <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7408\" href=\"/ratchet/4005-7408/\" slug=\"ratchet\">Ratchet</a> saves Omega Supreme's life but nobody can stop a now Dark Engergon full Megatron from unleashing Dark Engergon to Cybertron's core.</p><p>Detecting a transmision from Sentinel Prime, autobots <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7409\" href=\"/jazz/4005-7409/\" slug=\"jazz\">Jazz</a> and Optimus Prime go to Kaon to save him. Before he dies Sentinel tells Optimus to save the core. Optimus, Bumblebee and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41909\" href=\"/jetfire/4005-41909/\" slug=\"jetfire\">Jetfire</a> go to the core avoiding Dark Energon on the way. At the core Bumblebee takes out the Plasma Energy Chamber, and Optimus recieves a mental communication from the core itself, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54920\" href=\"/primus/4005-54920/\" slug=\"primus\">Primus</a>. Now that Dark Energon has stop contaminating the core in which the planet will take centuries to heal itself and during that time will not be able to create enough Energon to surfice the Cybertronian poppulation, To shoe Optimus not to lose hope Primus give him the Matrix of Leadership.</p><p>Seeing that the planet will soon be uninhabitable Optimus Prime orders the Ark to be thier new Autobot vessel to venture to find the Allspark. Optimus quickly asks Alpha Trion to come with the autobots in search for the Allspark. Alpha Trion refuses and wants to be with the planet during its demise.</p><p>With the Nemisis, the Decepticons battleship ready to venture through space to find the Allspark, Jazz has found an energy signature of the Allspark.

It is set in a world where only females have superpowers - both heroes and villains. Each title is written by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42109\" href=\"/justin-gray/4040-42109/\" slug=\"justin-gray\">Justin Gray</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3068\" href=\"/jimmy-palmiotti/4040-3068/\" slug=\"jimmy-palmiotti\">Jimmy Palmiotti</a>, with various artists contributing to the project. The story will run through five three-issue mini series, each introducing a specific character, before launching into an on-going book, starring all the characters working together.</p><p><b>Titles</b></p><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-49326\" href=\"/ame-comi-i-wonder-woman/4050-49326/\" slug=\"ame-comi-i-wonder-woman\">Ame-Comi I: Wonder Woman</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-49807\" href=\"/ame-comi-ii-batgirl/4050-49807/\" slug=\"ame-comi-ii-batgirl\">Ame-Comi II: Batgirl</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-50335\" href=\"/ame-comi-iii-duela-dent/4050-50335/\" slug=\"ame-comi-iii-duela-dent\">Ame-Comi III: Duela Dent</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-50925\" href=\"/ame-comi-iv-power-girl/4050-50925/\" slug=\"ame-comi-iv-power-girl\">Ame-Comi IV: Power Girl</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-51437\" href=\"/ame-comi-v-supergirl/4050-51437/\" slug=\"ame-comi-v-supergirl\">Ame-Comi V: Supergirl</a></li></ul><p>The series is the continued in the on-going <a data-ref-id=\"4050-52031\" href=\"/ame-comi-girls/4050-52031/\" slug=\"ame-comi-girls\">Ame-Comi Girls</a></p><h2>Characters</h2><h4>Heroes</h4><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" slug=\"wonder-woman\">Wonder Woman</a> (Diana Prince): First appeared in Ame-Comi I: Wonder Woman #1.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\" href=\"/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/\" slug=\"barbara-gordon\">Batgirl</a> (Barbara Gordon): First appeared in Ame-Comi II: Batgirl #1.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-4915\" href=\"/power-girl/4005-4915/\" slug=\"power-girl\">Power Girl</a> (Kara Jor-El): First appeared in Ame-Comi IV: Power Girl #1.

    "description": "<p>The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59280\" href=\"/toa-nuva/4060-59280/\">Toa Nuva</a> have returned to their respective cities after having regained their powers. All across <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57966\" href=\"/the-island-of-mata-nui/4020-57966/\">Mata-Nui</a> games and festivals are being held in celebration of the relatively peaceful time that has come upon the island. A game of Koli (K-Oh-Lee), is being played in Ta-Koro (Tah-Koh-Roh)'s new stadium. Just before the game starts a young Matoran named Jaller (Jah-Lah) is searching for his friend Takua (Tah-Koo-ah), even though they are both supposed to be playing in the Koli match that is about to start. He finds Takua in a cavern under the city examining a shiny golden <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56406\" href=\"/kanohi/4055-56406/\">Kanohi</a> mask. They make their way back to the city and arrive just as the game starts. After the game the city is attacked by creatures called Rahkshi, or, the sons of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55448\" href=\"/teridax/4005-55448/\">Makuta</a>. The Toa Nuva in the city are only able to hold off the attacks long enough to save the Matoran and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57409\" href=\"/turaga/4060-57409/\">Turaga</a> who were inside. After evacuating the populace the city sinks into the surrounding lava and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50973\" href=\"/tahu/4005-50973/\">Tahu Nuva</a>'s mask gets poisoned by a Rahkshi and quickly begins to spread across his armor and body.</p><p>At the request of Turaga <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70080\" href=\"/vakama/4005-70080/\">Vakama</a>, Jaller and Takua set off to find the Toa to whom the mask, supposedly, belongs. Using the mask as a guide, they follow the light from it all the way around the island and Takua, being the designated herald, makes a stop wherever he can to inquire if anyone has seen a Toa (a futile question that he already knows the answer to). At the same time the Toa Nuva are struggling to draw the Rahkshi's attention away from the Matoran, and, more specifically, the herald, as Takua and Jaller try, seemingly in vain, to find the mysterious Toa of Light. Tahu's poisoning gets only worse and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51243\" href=\"/gali/4005-51243/\">Gali Nuva</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51054\" href=\"/kopaka/4005-51054/\">Kopaka Nuva</a> are forced to freeze him to save him from having a poisoned mind.</p><p>The herald's journey finally leads him to the temple of Kini-Nui in the center of the island. It is here that Takua and Jaller are finally cornered by the Rahkshi and, although the Toa Nuva arrived in time to save Takua's life, Jaller is killed before the Toa can do anything. The Toa Nuva are fighting a losing battle so, as a last resort, Takua puts on the mask of light and discovers the Toa of Light was inside of himself. He is transformed by the masks power into a powerful Toa warrior. With this change Takua (now <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56191\" href=\"/takanuva/4005-56191/\">Takanuva</a>) makes the decision to take the battle of Light vs Shadow to the Master of Shadows himself, Makuta Teridax. He builds a vehicle from the destroyed husks of the Rahkshi and travels to the very heart of the island Where the Toa Mata had faced Makuta for the first time. A titanic struggle takes place, in which the Turaga and Toa become trapped in Makutas lair and are freed when Takanuva and Makuta Teridax meld together via a large pool of energized protodermis. They break the door and, as they separate into their own unique bodies, a massive explosion is produced that destroy's a wall in the darkest corner of the room as well as Makuta's armor, effectively defeating the greatest enemy the population of Mata-Nui has ever known. Having had much revealed to him by sharing the mind of Teridax, Takanuva discovers that he has the power to resurrect his friend Jaller. The passage-way that was revelaed turns out to be the only way back to the Turaga's past home island of Metru-Nui.</p><p>As the Turaga decide to travel back to Metru-Nui Vakama decides that the Toa must know the truth and he shocks them (as well as the readers) with the fact that the Toa Nuva are NOT the first Toa.</p><p><i>These comics are shorter stories interjected into the plotline of 2003's</i> <a data-ref-id=\"4025-1445\" href=\"/bionicle-mask-of-light-the-movie/4025-1445/\">Mask of Light</a> <i>movie, Yet both the movie and the comics are written by the same author and therefore form a congruent storyline that leads into the next, much clearer, story arc.</i></p>",

During a stake out to prevent any attack on Hady, Bruce feels as if something is wrong, and Joker revisiting past crimes seems a bit off.

Within the toxin, three dumby chemicals are found that don't contribute to any of the toxin's effects, but Bruce figures out it's a message, as the first letter of each chemical spells \"ACE,\" as in the <a href=\"/ace-chemical-processing-plant/4020-57342/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57342\">Ace Chemical Processing Plant</a>, where the man who would become the Joker, fell into a vat of chemicals that changed him forever.</p><p>Shortly after arriving at the Ace plant, Bruce finds Joker, dressed up in his old Red Hood gang attire, from the night he and Batman first met. Bruce, however, realises that the person in the Red Hood costume was not in fact the Joker, and so charges at Joker's accomplice, only to be knocked in an empty vat, which becomes locked and starts to fill with the same chemicals during the original accident that had created the Joker. It is then revealed that <a href=\"/harley-quinn/4005-1696/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1696\">Harley Quinn</a> is under the hood, and despite her absolute devotion to Joker, even she is visibly distraught, tearfully telling Batman that something is different her Mr. J, unable to even begin to describe his plan. As Bruce demands to know where the Joker really is, elsewhere in <a href=\"/wayne-manor/4020-55767/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55767\">Wayne Manor</a>, wearing his skinned face as a macabre mask, Joker brutally attacks Alfred Pennyworth with a hammer.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2703291-screen_shot_2012_11_15_at_1.12.48_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2703291\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3182773109244\" data-width=\"952\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 952px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2703291-screen_shot_2012_11_15_at_1.12.48_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2703291\"><img alt=\"Gordon bleeding out\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2703291-screen_shot_2012_11_15_at_1.12.48_pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2703291-screen_shot_2012_11_15_at_1.12.48_pm.png 952w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2703291-screen_shot_2012_11_15_at_1.12.48_pm.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Gordon bleeding out\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2703291-screen_shot_2012_11_15_at_1.12.48_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2703291-screen_shot_2012_11_15_at_1.12.48_pm.png 952w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2703291-screen_shot_2012_11_15_at_1.12.48_pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gordon bleeding out</figcaption></figure><p>Having escaped the ACE Chemicals plant, Bruce comes back to his Manor to find Alfred missing. Searching through out his home, he finds an audio tape, of Joker addressing him, claiming he was throwing a party, and needed to borrow Alfred. The sounds of Alfred screaming while Joker burns his eyes with ammonia are too much for Bruce, as he crushes the tape and his stereo in anger, leaving to search for Alfred immediately after. Having noticed a label that simply said \"Gordon\" on the tape, Bruce concludes that James Gordon is Joker's next target, and tries to get him to go into hiding. Gordon refuses, claiming he doesn't want to leave his men on the front lines while he hides, but it's already too late, as somehow Joker managed to dose Gordon with a lethal amount of blood thinners, causing all of his blood to begin to empty from his body. Bruce manages to give Gordon a coagulant and get him to the hospital where he meets with <a href=\"/nightwing/4050-5755/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5755\">Nightwing</a> outside. Dick is the only person Bruce tells about Alfred, believing that if the other \"family\" members knew, their emotions would cause them to become reckless, thus putting themselves in danger. Bruce recruits Dick in his effort to stop Joker's next plan, which he believes to be a recreation of one of his original crimes, poisoning Gotham's water supply.</p><p>Sure enough, Bruce finds Joker waiting for him at the reservoir, but this time Joker has decided to get their \"business\" out of the way, perfectly choreographing what would have happened. He detonates a bomb at the aqueduct Nightwing is stationed at, and had already taken the liberty to personally kill the few that would have been poisoned if the plan had gone through like last time. Sickened, Bruce charges at the Joker, who manages to get him tangled up in heavy duty wires, lead by his signature chatter teeth. He begins to speak to Bruce, and reveal his true plan, and that is, to take out his \"family.\" Joker feels as if the allies Bruce has surrounded himself with over the years have made him weak. Joker begins to address said allies who he knows are probably listening in through the raid, and plainly states: \"I know who you are!\" He continues to state that he knows every single thing about them, and believes them to be nothing more than a distraction to his king, Batman, who Joker says believes it too. Joker claims to know a secret that Batman has been hiding from all his allies, and that within 72 hours, they'll all be dead, and Batman will be the one who kills them. When the GCPD arrive to arrest the Joker, he has shot at with rocket launchers. In the struggle, Batman was poisoned and falls into the reservoir.</p><p>Batman wakes up in the Batcave, with <a href=\"/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Barbara Gordon</a>, <a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Tim Drake</a>, <a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd</a>, <a href=\"/damian-wayne/4005-42413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\">Damian Wayne</a>, and Dick Grayson there looking for answers. Batman reveals to his \"family\" that years ago, in an early encounter with the Joker, afterwards when he returned to the cave, he found a simple joker playing card in a puddle outside of his boat. There was nothing too the card, and Bruce believed that Joker simply attached it to the boat to taunt him, saying that the evidence proved that there was no way Joker had infiltrated the cave and learned his identity. The rest of Bruce's allies have a hard time believing Bruce, but he attempts to reassure them that their identities are not in danger, then leaves to search for Joker's hide out. Batman then tracks down the cell phone that Joker used in order to detonate the bomb, which leads him to a guard at Arkham Asylum. The guard reveals that Joker has taken the Asylum hostage and black mailing many of the guards into working with him. With Joker's location in his mind, Bruce heads off to face his old foe.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2834958\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.77046548956661\" data-width=\"1869\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1869px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2834958\"><img alt=\"The Throne Room\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png 1869w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Throne Room\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png 1869w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2834958-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_1.52.08_pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Throne Room</figcaption></figure><p>In Arkham, Bruce finds himself confronted with many trials set up by the Joker, with the theme of the Asylum being Bruce's Castle, and the inmates his royal subjects. After making his way through the Asylum, Bruce finds Joker waiting for him in <a href=\"/jeremiah-arkham/4005-27541/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27541\">Jeremiah Arkham</a>'s living quarters, along with his \"closet\" subjects, <a href=\"/riddler/4005-3718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\">Riddler</a>, <a href=\"/two-face/4005-5555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\">Two-Face</a> and <a href=\"/penguin/4005-4885/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4885\">Penguin</a>. Joker has a number of civilians dressed up like members of the Justice League, having them attempt to pull the electrified sword (chainsaw) from the stone, illustrating that he could have been the jester to any one of those kings or queens, but he chose Batman. Bruce manages to get past the blockage in the door after Joker ends up killing the man dressed as Superman, but before he's able to do anything, Joker alerts him to a number of screens showing all of his allies defeated, and captured by the Joker. With his allies captured, Bruce is forced to obey Joker, and sit in an electric chair, that causes him to pass out, proving Joker's point that his \"family\" makes him weak. With Batman knocked out, Two Face and the others contemplate killing him right then and there, but Joker doesn't allow it, dismissing them from his grand scheme. When Two Face becomes enraged, Joker locks him and the others behind a cage door, as Riddler, the only one who could find an escape, falls unconscious due to being poisoned by the Joker. Two Face is left to be berated by Joker, who starts to take Batman away to complete his plan, but before he leaves, he throws Two Face and Penguin a bone, showing them a surprise he has for Batman under a bloody silver platter.</p><h3>Attacks on the Family</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2834987\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1737488196412\" data-width=\"1059\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1059px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2834987\"><img alt=\"Death of a Clown\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png 1059w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death of a Clown\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png 1059w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2834987-screen_shot_2013_01_26_at_2.06.52_pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death of a Clown</figcaption></figure><p>Prior to Batman's eventual capture by the Joker, the Clown Prince of Crime targets many of his allies and some enemies too.

He finds <a href=\"/catwoman/4005-1698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1698\">Catwoman</a> and begins to play emotional head games with her, mocking her relationship with Batman, and trying to sever whatever tie she has with him.

Joker reveals that he's doused the entire room in gasoline, and placed flints under Bruce's chair, so if he gets up, the room will ignite. Joker then reveals that Alfred is alive, but infected with Joker toxin, as he summons the butler to lift the sacks off all the family's heads, revealing them all to be wrapped in bloody bandages. Under each of their platters are what look to be their faces, as Joker explains that under his grin, is just more grin. Joker continues on to poke and prod at his and Bruce's relationship, until Bruce has had enough, and stands up, igniting the gasoline around him, but knowing where he is in the cave system, blows a hole in the roof to allow water to douse the flames. As Joker attempts to escape, Bruce attends to his family, finding all their faces to be intact, as Dick tells him to go after Joker. As Bruce leaves to chase down his old foe, a trap at the table triggers, filling the room with Joker's toxin, leaving the family to go wild and attack each other. Deeper in the cave, Bruce confronts Joker, having faith that his family will pull through, and devoting all his time to the clown. Bruce proclaims that it's over, their entire game, that he's \"broken the spell.\" He informs Joker that he did what the clown couldn't, and looked all the way into his foe, finding out his name, his history, his family, much to the Joker's displeasure. Bruce attempts to whisper his information into the Joker's ear, but before he can, Joker covers Bruce's mouth with an electric buzzer and falls into the abyss of the river system within the caves. Bruce then returns to find that Alfred had somehow broken through the Joker's toxin and gotten the family to cease their fighting as well.</p><p>Sometime later, while Alfred recovers, Bruce tells him a story that he had never mentioned anyone. Shortly after he had taken Dick into his care, he visited Arkham Asylum with some of Gotham's elite. He managed to break free of the group and find his way to the Joker's cell, where he attempted to return the card left in the Batcave. Joker turned around and looked directly at Bruce, but more through him, as he didn't care to see who Batman was, not even reacting in the slightest. Bruce then informs Alfred that he has invited the family over to meet after everything that has happened, but soon finds that everyone has declined to meet with him, Dick being the only one to actually call to inform him. Alone, Bruce enters the cave and sits down at his computer where Joker's face still has an \"IDENTITY UNKNOWN\" label on it. The computer finishes deciphering an extra compound found in Joker's most recent toxin strain, the element hahnium, whose element symbol is \"Ha.\"</p><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/batman-the-dark-knight-17/4000-503332/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-503332\">Batman: The Dark Knight #17</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/batman-robin-3-jokers-todesspiel/4000-446882/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-446882\">Batman &amp; Robin #3</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"/batman-sonderband-42/4000-510049/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-510049\">Batman Sonderband #42</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"/batgirl-3/4000-503829/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-503829\">Batgirl #3</a> (German)</li></ul><h4>Collected Editions</h4><ul><li><p><a href=\"/batman-der-tod-der-familie/4050-87030/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-87030\">Batman: Der Tod Der Familie</a> (German)</p></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Catwoman's mysterious trip to Italy along with Riddler with a certain mission on her mind. The story has her witnessing shocking revelations in connection with the Falcone crime family.",
    "description": "<p>Catwoman and the Riddler (as Edward Nygma) take a trip to Rome. There Catwoman meets The Blonde, a hitman, who sets up a meeting between Selina and the capo of the Italian mob. Don Verinni, the person Catwoman was due to meet, is murdered using the Joker's venom. Catwoman is blamed, and soon all three 'heroes' are beset by Verinni's assassins. Meanwhile, Selina suffers nightmares featuring Batman. After Catwoman's hotel room burns down, forcing her to jump into a pool completely naked in order to escape death, Catwoman, Eddie (as Selina refers to him) and the Blonde escape to his yacht.</p><p>In a pitched fight with the Don's son Guillermo, Catwoman is put \"on ice\" using Mr. Freeze's ice gun, but escapes and barters a deal with Guillermo. The Riddler then retreats back to Gotham City for a short time (in which he attends the Hangman Trial conducted by Two-Face during the parallel events of Batman: Dark Victory).</p><p>After stealing a valuable ring from the Vatican, Catwoman is attacked by the Cheetah. After Catwoman defeats the villain (with the assistance of The Blonde), she visits Louisa, Carmine's widow. Louisa denies that Catwoman is her daughter, and then orders the Blonde to kill Catwoman. Eventually, Catwoman figures out the truth: the Riddler has betrayed her, using the trademarks of the Joker, Mr. Freeze, and also the Scarecrow's fear gas (which was the cause of Catwoman's Bat-related dreams). The Riddler believed that Catwoman knew the answer to what he considered the greatest riddle: \"Who is Batman under the mask?\" Catwoman defeats the Riddler and his henchmen.</p><p>The Riddler later captures the ring, but it turns out to be a fake and infects himself on his plane with Scarecrow's fear gas. A booby trap set by Catwoman. The Blonde reveals that as a child he was witness to his father's attempted infanticide on the Roman's second daughter (in an effort to curry favor with his Don, who respected masculine children) and that he believes that daughter was Catwoman, though he has no proof. Louisa later kills the Blonde for failing to murder Catwoman and bring her the Capo ring. Catwoman waits for the Blonde at the airport but when he does not show, she returns to Gotham, with no hard evidence to prove the identity of her parents. The story ends with a two-page epilogue that is an identical scene from Batman: Dark Victory, in which Catwoman bids farewell to Carmine Falcone at his grave.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><span><a data-ref-id=\"4000-285072\" href=\"/catwoman-when-in-rome-when-in-rome/4000-285072/\" slug=\"catwoman-when-in-rome-when-in-rome\">Catwoman: When In Rome</a></span></li></ul>",

The carnival is run by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-85366\" href=\"/sir-sigmoid/4005-85366/\" slug=\"sir-sigmoid\">Sir Sigmoid</a>, an evil demon who eats the souls of children.</p><h2>Ectokid and Saint Sinner</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132162/2557046-arc.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2557046\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.94495412844037\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132162/2557046-arc.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2557046\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132162/2557046-arc.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132162/2557046-arc.png 436w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132162/2557046-arc.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-57091\" href=\"/dexter-mungo/4005-57091/\" slug=\"dexter-mungo\">Ectokid</a> is drawn to the carnival when he sees a signpost advertising it. Next to the signpost is a worm in a top hat, named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-85368\" href=\"/tequila/4005-85368/\" slug=\"tequila\">Tequila</a>. The worm jumps into Ectokid's ear and takes control of him, luring him to the carnival. When he gets there, he meets a young man named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58723\" href=\"/saint-sinner/4005-58723/\" slug=\"saint-sinner\">Phillip Fetter</a>, who appears to be just a normal dead teen, enjoying the games of Sir Sigmoid's Arcadia. What he doesn't know is that this is really the soul of a man better known as Saint Sinner, who isn't really a teenager at all. The carnival appears to have lulled him back to a comforting, childhood state.</p><p>The two boys meet, and instantly get along, finding that they have an awful lot in common. Both have the same taste in music, and both are not quite dead, existing in a grey area between life and death.</p><h2>Escape From Arcadia</h2><p>Though he is a formidable opponent, it is not Sir Sigmoid who presents Ectokid with his greatest challenge, when it comes to escaping from Arcadia. His biggest challenge is convincing Saint Sinner to leave. He is reluctant to go back to the real world, where he will no longer be a teenager. Also, he knows that going back to his body means having to fight for control of it all over again - in the Ectosphere, he is not possessed, and can enjoy free will.</p>",

Part 8 begins with Jaeger mysteriously teleported to a wasteland outside.
