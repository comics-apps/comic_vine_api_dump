Cassidy knows a man who can possibly help them with that, a man by the name of Si. Si tells them about \"The Reaver Cleaver\", a serial killer who's been stalking people and murdering them.</p><p>They leave the bar, Cassidy and Si walk off to catch up and hopefully have Cassidy ask Si about God. Meanwhile, Jesse and Tulip talk about their relationship etc. Soon, Cassidy, Si, Jesse and Tulip meet up. Si leaves, Tulip go's off to get in bed and Jesse and Cassidy go on to the Empire State Building. They have a conversation and Jesse explains why he wants to hunt God down.</p><p>__</p><p>The next day, we see Jesse and Cass in a bar shooting billards on the body of some unlucky bastard that Jesse knocked unconscious, Cassidy leaves to go explore the city and Jesse heads back to the hotel room yet not before the two men have a serious conversation about Tulip. They also agree to meet each other at Si's house at ten PM. Jesse heads to the hotel room and over-hears a conversation Tulip is having with her mobb boss who's dissatisfied with her job on the man she supposed to kill. Elsewhere, John and Paulie are tracking down the Reaver Cleaver. They find nothing other than scared house-wife who's recently her husband so they head back to the office. They eat lunch when the real \"Reaver-Cleaver\" calls them. They can't tap the phone but he does say he'll call again.</p><p>Jesse, Cassidy and Tulip head to Si's house and hear the story of how Cass and Si met each other down at Woodstock. They then talk about a blind man who see's perfectly, never hits anything, no dog or stick..claims the lord guides him whom calls himself \"The Big Man\". Jesse asks to go see him and they agree to see him the next day.</p><p>__</p><p>They head to see the Big Man and it's revealed Si is the \"Reaver-Cleaver\" to both Tulip and Cassidy, to Cassidy when he finds severed heads in Si's refrigerator as well as Tulip when he stabs her in the hand. Jesse walks into what he thinks will be the \"The Big Man's House\" but it's actually the apartment of Paulie Bridges, the detective on the case of The Reaver Cleaver. Jesse walks in on an S&amp;M Orgy whilst Tulip is dealing with a bleeding hand and an insane serial killer, elsewhere Cassidy's inside Si's apartment surrounded by police outside. Cassidy plays dead and convinces police he's one of the Killer's victims whilst John Tool arrives at Paulies apartment along with Si who's there with Jesse and Paulie and now Tulip who walks in bleeding half to death.</p><blockquote>To cover his tracks, Custer used Tool's gun to shoot Coltrane in the head. In return for letting the world see him as a hero for once. - Taken from John Tool's page</blockquote><p>Jesse's proclaimed dead by the police department to further cover his tracks...There are ten million stories in Naked City, not all of them have Moral.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-25742\" href=\"/preacher-gone-to-texas/4050-25742/\" slug=\"preacher-gone-to-texas\">Preacher: Gone to Texas</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-183707\" href=\"/preacher-book-one/4000-183707/\" slug=\"preacher-book-one\">Preacher Book 1</a></li></ul>",

Larfleeze is demanding that Hal gives him the blue ring, and in return he will tell him his origin. Larfleeze tells Hal about how he used to belong to a group of pirates who stole a treasure that was supposed to be worth an entire galaxy, however that wasn't enough for them. They tracked down another treasure and each of Larfleeze's comrades perished in search of it, however Larfleeze eventually won this treasure over, and he became the possessor of the Orange Lantern. The Guardians told Larfleeze they would allow him to have this power and that his entire galaxy would be off limits to anyone else if he would hand over the treasure he stole in the first place, that treasure being <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\" href=\"/parallax/4005-41293/\" slug=\"parallax\">  Parallax</a>.  <br/> <br/>After hearing his story Hal still won't hand over his blue ring and Larfleeze decides he's going to take it one way or another. When Hal says he hopes that the ring will shut up after this is all over, he is able to finally activate the Blue Lantern's power. He uses this power to blast Larfleeze and weaken him, but not enough to finish him off and win the fight. The Guardians realize that Larfleeze is too strong for them to fight so they get him to surrender by giving him a new target. They tell Larfleeze where the Blue Lantern's homeworld is and so Larfleeze sends his army of constructs to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56000\" href=\"/odym/4020-56000/\" slug=\"odym\"> Odym</a> to take this power for himself. <br/><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-32710\" href=\"/green-lantern-agent-orange/4050-32710/\" slug=\"green-lantern-agent-orange\">           Green Lantern: Agent Orange</a></li></ul>",

However, using his enhanced sense of smell, Daken the Dark Wolverine noticed something weird about \"Venom\"'s smell.</p><p>Norman shows his team the American Son Armor which he intends on giving to Harry to have him become the team's \"Captain America\". A test subject that has been injected with both the Super-Soldier and the Goblin serums escaped and attacked Osborn but was stopped by Peter in order to maintain the guise of Mac Gargan.</p><p>While in the Tower, Harry meets up with Lily and tells her that he plans on curing her from her Goblin condition and she gives him a keycard that allows him to access any facility within the Tower without alerting security.</p><p>While Peter/Venom is on monitor duty, Daken suddenly attacks him and reveals that he knows who he is because of his smell. The two fight and Daken gets the upper-hand by drugging Peter with his pheromones but Spider-Man, closing his eyes and relying only on his Spider-Sense, defeats Daken by throwing him into an electric generator. Harry suddenly appears and asks what's going on. Peter reveals his identity as the real Spider-Man and tells Harry that he's here to help and asks him to find some place to hide the unconcious Daken but Harry declines Spider-Man's interference and urges him to leave. Then on, Norman along with the rest of the Avengers appears and Spider-Man tells him that Daken kidnapped Harry. However, when asked weither this is true or not, to Peter's surprise, Harry does not go along with Peter's ruse and tells Norman that it's not \"his\" Spider-Man. Bullseye then shoots with two arrows Peter in the legs and Norman procedes to shoot Peter with a gun at point blank. However, Peter survived thanks to the specific nature of his mask.

Before Norman could finish Peter off with one final repulsor blast to the head, he tells Peter that the only reason Harry joined the Avengers was because Lily is pregnant. Norman reveals that he intends on sacrificing Harry in battle so that he would gain sympathy from the public and the government and be allowed to use his authority unhinged. When Peter asks him how could he do this to his own son, Norman coldely replies that Harry is not his only son. After hearing this, Spider-Man breaks free from his restraints in a state of fury and attacks both Norman and Bullseye and goes to inform Harry of Norman's true intentions.</p><p>Meanwhile Harry manages to get from Norman's ;ab the serum necessary to cure Lily from her condition. However, when he presents it to her, she suprisingly knocks it away from him and reveals that she never really loved him and that the child she is carrying is Norman's. With that said, she transforms into Menace and flies away on her Glider,leaving a shocked Harry to go after her. However, Norah managed to seduce a security guard into giving her a pass key and she saw the whole encounter between Harry and Lily.</p><p>Spider-Man tries to escape Norman's grasp but fails and succombs to Norman's vicious attacks. Spider-Man's mask has dissolved but Norman is unable to see his face because he was being attacked by an enraged Harry who is using the American Son Armor.</p><p>The battle spills into the streets between father and son, both using their respective armors. At first, Norman doesn't understand why Harry is attacking him until Harry mentions Lily and his child. Now that Harry knows the truth, Norman shows his disinterest in his son because Harry was never worthy of his legacy and he is looking for a new heir but the goblin serum in his blood prevented him from having a proper child. However, because of Lily's unique Menace DNA, Norman found mating with her possible so he would have an heir that would not suffer from the side effects the children he had with Gwen suffer from. And accodring to Norman, Lily was far from unwilling, angering Harry. Norman decides not to hold back and procedes to attack Harry. Menace joins the fight and attempts to help Norman but Spider-Man saves Harry from Norman's killing blow, webs Menace to her glider and destroys the engine. This allows Harry to gain the upper hand and with Norman at his mercy, he prepares to finish him off. However, despite remembering Wolverine's advice about finishing Norman if has the chance, Peter refuses to allow his best friend to become a murderer, and convinces him to spare Norman's life because in killing him, he would become the son he always wanted. Harry now understands and leaves his father in an angry and bloody state.</p><p>Peter then quickly goes to a hospital and tells May and Jay that he was the victim of a \"hit and run\". Jay covers Peter's medical expences and Harry delivers him flowers. At her apartment, while watching a video from Avengers Tower, Norah Winters is ready to tell Ben Urich of her latest story until she sees in the video Norman brutally punishing the guard she seduced into giving her the keycard, saying that he never forgets the people who mess with his affair. Upon seeing this image, Norah becomes terrified and decides not to publish her story yet.</p><p>In the epilogue of the story, Norman Osborn stands with Lily and tells his unborn child that his brother is dead to them now and that his little \"goblin prince\" is going to be worthy of his legacy.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/amazing-spider-man-the-osborn-identity/4050-37181/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37181\">Amazing Spider-Man: The Osborn Identity</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-american-son/4050-31806/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-31806\">Spider-Man: American Son</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-248756/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-248756\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #27</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-astonishing-spider-man-28/4000-297096/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-297096\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #28</a></li><li>The Astonishing Spider-Man #29</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-astonishing-spider-man-30/4000-389705/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-389705\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #30</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-astonishing-spider-man-31/4000-389706/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-389706\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #31</a></li></ul>",

Having grown stronger, the Shadow King emits negative feelings, an effect felt across the globe, as people everywhere suddenly begin acting on their hatred and prejudices.</p><p>The mutants on Muir Island have been reduced to their basest form and have begun fighting and hunting each other for sport. The Professor leads a group of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" slug=\"shield\">SHIELD</a> agents and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\" href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" slug=\"x-factor\">X-Factor</a> to Muir in an attempt to stop the Shadow King's machinations. Some X-Men, led by Forge, have fought against the negative influence, but the only way to truly defeat the Shadow King is on the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54190\" href=\"/astral-plane/4020-54190/\" slug=\"astral-plane\">Astral Plane</a>. Professor X goes in but can't defeat the Shadow King himself. Fortunately, his X-Men show up to help protect him. Things look hopeless, however, until Forge finally finds a way to destroy the nexus that anchors the Shadow King to both the physical and astral existences. The Shadow King shrinks into the void and leaves the X-Men to pick up the pieces.</p><h2>Effects</h2><h3>The Muir Island X-Men</h3><p>Polaris gets her magnetic powers back and she, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7910\" href=\"/madrox/4005-7910/\" slug=\"madrox\">Madrox</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7599\" href=\"/strong-guy/4005-7599/\" slug=\"strong-guy\">Guido</a> are asked by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14860\" href=\"/valerie-cooper/4005-14860/\" slug=\"valerie-cooper\">Val Cooper</a> to join a new, government sponsored mutant group. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13349\" href=\"/legion/4005-13349/\" slug=\"legion\">Legion</a>, who had been possessed by the Shadow King, lies in a coma. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3181\" href=\"/banshee/4005-3181/\" slug=\"banshee\">Siryn</a> leaves everyone and eventually joins <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\" href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" slug=\"x-force\">X-Force</a>. Since most of Muir Island was destroyed, Moira goes to live at Xavier's mansion for a time. Forge didn't pick a new group to be affiliated with but also went to the X-Mansion and worked on the technical affairs. Banshee also joined the rebuilding effort without truly joining the X-Men.</p><h3>X-Factor</h3><p>The five members rejoined the X-Men. X-Factor then became the new <a data-ref-id=\"4060-24132\" href=\"/freedom-force/4060-24132/\" slug=\"freedom-force\">Freedom Force</a>, a government sponsored team that would be headed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\" href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" slug=\"havok\">Havok</a>.</p><h3>X-Men</h3><p>With so many X-Men, the team split into two teams. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> lead the Blue Team, consisting of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\" href=\"/gambit/4005-1499/\" slug=\"gambit\">Gambit</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\" href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" slug=\"psylocke\">Psylocke</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\" href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" slug=\"rogue\">Rogue</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\" href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a>, while <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\" href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" slug=\"storm\">Storm</a> lead the Gold Team, consisting of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\" href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" slug=\"archangel\">Angel</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\" href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" slug=\"iceman\">Iceman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\" href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" slug=\"colossus\">Colossus</a>, and the soon-to-be-introduced <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\" href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" slug=\"bishop\">Bishop</a>.</p><p>Also, the Shadow King had crushed Xavier's legs, leaving him confined to a wheelchair once again.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4000-311494\" href=\"/x-men-by-claremont-and-lee-omnibus-volume-two/4000-311494/\" slug=\"x-men-by-claremont-and-lee-omnibus-volume-two\">X-Men by Claremont and Lee Omnibus #2</a></p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4000-277157\" href=\"/x-men-visionaries-the-art-of-adam-and-andy-kubert/4000-277157/\" slug=\"x-men-visionaries-the-art-of-adam-and-andy-kubert\">X-Men Visionaries: The Art of Adam and Andy Kubert</a></p>",

Since this happened as the resurrection ritual was still in progress a Speed Force Surge sent a massive amount of feedback energy that killed almost all of Savitar's followers save for Lady Flash who in turn gained the power of the entire Cult and set out to destroy Barry for what he had done. <br/><br/>Later Barry and Wally learned that The Speed Force Surge had also affected the corpse of The Black Flash and left energy residue which led them all the way to Fallville, where they found The Black Flash's corpse in the same spot where the children who originally discovered it did. As they are inspecting the corpse, Barry and Wally are attacked by Lady Flash and easily subdue her but when they do she ends up dying the same way Savitar did. <br/><br/>As a result she unleashes all of The Speed Force Energy inside her body which in turn is fed directly into both Barry, Wally and the corpse of The Black Flash.

    "description": "<p>In the Aftermath of the Invincible War, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\" href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" slug=\"invincible\">Mark Grayson</a> sits with his injured girlfriend Atom Eve at the local hospital. All over the world, people blame Invincible for the invasion and say he was the one who took innocent lives and caused all of the destruction. Unfortunately, things get worse for Mark when he is later called off by the clean up crew to restore balance and order in the world that has lost almost all hope. While coming out of the hospital, other super hero teams such as Youngblood and Capes Inc. help rebuild bouilding and locate trapped bodies under tons of rubble. While Mark begins to help with the damage control, he is attacked by the angered Powerplex. Powerplex is later taken down by Youngblood and relocated to a secure area. In the end, Cecil and a handful of other fellow heroes gather around in sacure operating base and discuss the situation. Basically, the entire world has been left defencless against any attack either from this planet or thoose outside of it. Most of the Guardians of the Globe have been killed off, retired or badly injured during the war. It was now up to Robot, Brit, Donald, Sampson, Cecil, and now Invincible to restore order to the world by brigning together another super human team. Unfortunetly, Mark declines from the job and sets out to return to help with the damage control. When hours have passed, a balding Viltrumite with a scare on his right eye approaches the scene where Mark stood. The Viltrumite called himself \"Conquest\" and if Mark resisted him he would be eliminated immediately where he stood. Mark replied that he has been wanted to hit something real hard after his long day of recovering and leaped forward into action against Conquest.</p><h3>Collected Editions</h3><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-46178\" href=\"/invincible-still-standing/4050-46178/\" slug=\"invincible-still-standing\">Invincible: Still Standing</a></li></ul>",

They find a couple of mattresses in an abandoned truck, which would grant them days of good sleep, just before stopping for the night. On the next day, they are ready to leave once again. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58879\" href=\"/andrea/4005-58879/\" slug=\"andrea\">Andrea</a> says the twins are peeing in the woods and that she'll go get them. However, she finds Billy dead next to Ben, his brother, who holds a knife. The group was shocked and couldn't agree what to do with the disturbed boy. Abraham voted to kill the kid and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42443\" href=\"/rick-grimes/4005-42443/\" slug=\"rick-grimes\">Rick</a> supported the idea. But the rest of the group, especially Dale and Andrea, was reluctant to murder Ben. Just as they speak, a priest approaches. He says that he has food in his Church and that will take the group there tomorrow. That same night, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42540\" href=\"/carl-grimes/4005-42540/\" slug=\"carl-grimes\">Carl</a> confronted Ben and without any trace of a doubt, put the other kid out of his misery. On the next day, as the group leaves, we see the hunters spying on them.</p><p>They find out that the Church wasn't as close as they thought it was, since they actually don't arrive that day and have yet to find a place to stay for the night. As they sit down for dinner, a group of zombies attack them. The survivors quickly kill them, although, unknown to them, Dale was bitten.</p><h3>Not Alone</h3><p>Andrea wakes up in the middle of the night to pee. She goes to the closest tree, just before noticing that she isn't alone. Andrea yells and the rest of the group awakes. As he realizes he is not alone with the woman anymore, the hunter flees. That same night, Dale goes out and is kidnapped.</p><p>The next day, the group goes out looking for dale, as they start to suspect that the appearance of the priest has something to do with the abduction. Unsuccessful, they finally head out for the Church. Once they arrive there, Andrea once again sees one of the hunters spying on them and warns the group.</p><p>The scene then changes back to Dale, as he wakes up in the Hunters' camp, only to find out that his other leg is missing: they are cannibals. The old man starts to laugh, before telling them that he was bitten and that the flesh they are eating is infected. Angry, the leader knocks him out.</p><p>Later on that night, Andrea tells Rick how much she loves Dale and that she wished she could tell him that just one more time. On the next day, Maggie finds Dale outside the Church. He is still breathing and, as Rick tells everyone to take him inside, he notices that they are being watched at that very moment. The group runs inside their temporary home, although one of the hunters shoots <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42537\" href=\"/glenn/4005-42537/\" slug=\"glenn\">Glenn</a>'s leg. Angry, Rick states that they are messing with the wrong people. Dale tells him how many hunters there are and what their home looks like. The priest tells Rick that there are 3 possible locations. The ex-cop makes a small group and takes off to finally end them.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132106/2910060-sem_t_tulo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2910060\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132106/2910060-sem_t_tulo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2910060\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132106/2910060-sem_t_tulo.png\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132106/2910060-sem_t_tulo.png 1366w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132106/2910060-sem_t_tulo.png 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132106/2910060-sem_t_tulo.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>After a day of searching, Abraham, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46819\" href=\"/michonne/4005-46819/\" slug=\"michonne\">Michonne</a>, Andrea, the priest and Grimes finally find the cannibals.

    "description": "<p>Through the years, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Henry (Hank) Pym</a> routinely suffered from periods of tension and depression. At the same time that the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers </a>were undergoing turbulent roster changes, Hank felt that his scientific research had gone nowhere since his discovery of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/pym-particles/4015-42077/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42077\">Pym Particles</a> and was overwhelmed with guilt over his creation of the robotic villain <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a>. Hank also increasing experienced a sense of inadequacy compared to his wife, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Janet</a>, who besides being the principal means of support in the marriage due to her inheritance from her dead <a href=\"/vernon-van-dyne/4005-66815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66815\">father</a>, had also achieved considerable success in her own career as a fashion designer and had effectively eclipsed Pym's career as a superhero with her consistent service to the Avengers as the Wasp. Pym comparatively had numerous periods of retirement and inactivity.</p><p>In the midst of another breakdown, Pym began to be verbally abusive toward the Wasp while attempting to compensate for his perceived shortcomings through renewed service in the Avengers as Yellowjacket. Things came to a head on an Avengers mission when Yellowjacket blasted an <a href=\"/elfqueen/4005-32596/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32596\">enemy </a>with whom <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> was attempting to negotiate in the back. Feeling Pym's actions endangered the team and the public, Captain America—as the standing Avengers Chairman—brought court-martial charges against him. From there, Hank would make two of the worse decisions of his life. In a misguided effort to make himself look good at the court-martial hearing, the increasingly unstable Pym created a giant robot programmed to attack the Avengers that only he would know how to defeat. When Janet discovered his plan and confronted Hank, the now-deranged and misguided Pym violently struck her across the face and attempted to carry out the ruse anyway.</p><p>Not only was Yellowjacket's plan painfully transparent at the court-martial hearing, it also backfired. His robot is about to kill him before Janet stopped it. The irony of Pym's downfall coming at the hands of a robot of his own invention was not lost on the other Avengers who recalled the threat of Ultron and ruled against Pym.</p><p>Expelled from the Avengers, divorced from Janet, and penniless, Pym was manipulated by his old enemy <a href=\"/egghead/4005-3797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3797\">Egghead </a>into stealing a quantity of the unbreakable metal <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">adamantium </a>from a government facility by using his niece <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/trish-starr/4005-32338/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32338\">Trish Starr's </a>life as a gambling chip. In the course of the robbery, the Mighty Avengers show up. Pym, desperate to save Trish, nearly defeats the Avengers (including <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, and Captain America), before a confrontation with his ex-wife proves his undoing. Pym is unable to prove that Egghead forced him into the robbery, and is sent to prison on charges of treason. While incarcerated, Hank despairs even further upon seeing his ex-wife in the tabloids being romanced by teammate and lady killer Tony Stark (Iron Man).</p><p>When it comes time for Pym's trial, he is kidnapped (although it looks like a prearranged escape) by the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\">Masters of Evil</a> at the command of Egghead, who wants Pym to create a machine to grant him eternal life. Seeing no other options Pym agrees, and soon shows Egghead the finished device, inviting the criminal to try it out. The suspicious Egghead makes Pym use the machine first, just as Pym had anticipated. Pym had loaded the machine with weapons and methods to defeat the Masters of Evil, whom he summarily defeats. Pym decks Egghead, and turns to leave, to turn himself in to the authorities, when Egghead pulls out a gun. The just-arriving Avenger member <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye </a>the marksman fires an arrow into the gun, which backfires, saving Pym but killing Egghead.</p><p>Henry Pym is cleared of all charges thanks to the evidence in Egghead's lair, but refuses to return to the Avengers, stating that his superhero career had got him into this mess, cost him his marriage, and that he would never return to it.</p><p>Although Hank and Janet have since shared occasional romantic encounters, their relationship never recovered from these events and they remain apart. Of course, Hank could not maintain his vow to remove himself from super-hero life. Months later, Pym would begin work as tech support for the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/west-coast-avengers/4050-3521/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3521\">West Coast Avengers</a> and eventually join their ranks.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/avengers-the-big-three/4050-46527/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-46527\">Avengers: The Big Three</a></li></ul>",

They collected a sample of the techno-organic creature, and began to experiment upon it. Bastion's knowledge allowed the Purifiers to make the techno-organic sample docile &amp; controllable. With the transmode-virus Bastion was able to infect or resurrect &amp; control notable figures who were responsible for the deaths of mutants: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13351\" href=\"/graydon-creed/4005-13351/\" slug=\"graydon-creed\">Graydon Creed</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13379\" href=\"/cameron-hodge/4005-13379/\" slug=\"cameron-hodge\">Cameron Hodge</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3556\" href=\"/donald-pierce/4005-3556/\" slug=\"donald-pierce\">Donald Pierce</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41482\" href=\"/leper-queen/4005-41482/\" slug=\"leper-queen\">Leper Queen</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15923\" href=\"/bolivar-trask/4005-15923/\" slug=\"bolivar-trask\">Bolivar Trask</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\" href=\"/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" slug=\"william-stryker\">William Stryker</a>.</p><h3>Eli Bard</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31599/712878-caliban_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712878\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0169100691776\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31599/712878-caliban_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712878\"><img alt=\"Caliban; Infected &amp; Resurrected\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31599/712878-caliban_00.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31599/712878-caliban_00.jpg 1301w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/31599/712878-caliban_00.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31599/712878-caliban_00.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Caliban; Infected &amp; Resurrected</figcaption></figure><p>However, unbeknownst to Bastion a new Purifier member had an agenda of his own. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59642\" href=\"/eli-bard/4005-59642/\" slug=\"eli-bard\">Eliphas</a> had been a Roman Senator thousands of years ago.

He agreed to help her sacrifice all the souls in Rome, which would make her a Goddess. Unfortunately, his last good deed was his undoing. Eliphas warned a homeless orphan child to leave the city, but the child warned the guards who subsequently captured Eliphas and Selene. Although believed to have been executed outside the city's borders, they freed themselves. Selene was angry with Eliphas and spurned him, threatening to kill him if they were to ever meet again.</p><p>With thousands of years the man who became known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59642\" href=\"/eli-bard/4005-59642/\" slug=\"eli-bard\">Eli Bard</a> had plotted &amp; schemed how to return himself to his former love. He infiltrated the Purifiers and became close to their highest ranking members. There, he discovered Bastion's plans involving the techno-organic virus, and observed their progress and successes. While the Purifier's were distracted fighting <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\" href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" slug=\"x-force\">X-Force</a>, Bard exposed himself to the docile Magus sample.

There, he found the graveyard of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\" href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" slug=\"warpath\">Warpath's</a> people; the slaughtered Apache tribe, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9637\" href=\"/caliban/4005-9637/\" slug=\"caliban\">Caliban</a> who had been shot in the back during the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-48995\" href=\"/messiah-complex/4045-48995/\" slug=\"messiah-complex\">Messiah CompleX</a>. Eli Bard resurrected them all, controlled them and lead them back to Selene. They became his offering to her, to allow him back into her life. Eli Bard offered his new ability to raise dead mutants as a means to grant Selene a chance to relive her original plan from Rome; to drain the souls of millions of dead mutants to transform her into a Goddess. Together with the mutant-tracking powers of Caliban, they began to hunt down deceased mutants, who would then be forced to obey Eli Bard's commands.</p><h3>Genosha</h3><p>Selene welcomed Eli Bard's new found abilities and the chance to become a Goddess. She surrounded herself with deadly mutants.

    "description": "<p>The Leader and M.O.D.O.K. had unleashed a Cathexis ray upon the heroes that had arrived to help, as well as hundreds of AIMarines, turning them all into Hulked-out versions of themselves. The Cathexis machine was basically the same machine that gave Leonard Samson and the Red Hulk their powers. The Leader revealed that all the Hulked-out-Heroes would soon die, because of the overload of radiation in their bodies. Bruce Banner and the other ‘smartest’ reconfigured the Cathexis machine to drain the radiation from the Hulked-out-Heroes, and so that the machine that's draining the radiation didn't malfunction or explode, Banner willingly absorbed the excess gamma radiation into his body. The machine started absorbing energy very quickly and Banner’s body could keep up with the absorption, so Samson (attempting to show that he was always a hero), walked to the machine and began to help Banner absorb the energy as well.</p><p>This turned out to be a poor decision on the part of Samson as his body could not contain the amount of energies that Banner's could. All of the excess energy burned Samson to a crisp and his charred body fell to the floor of the Helicarrier. The remaining heroes aboard the Helicarrier warned Banner to stop, as the energies he was absorbing would rob him of his freedom from the Hulk, but Banner knew the repercussions and told the others to get off the ship. Reed became worried about what the Hulk would do once he returned, only to have Amadeus Cho remind him, that this was what Banner had trained Skaar to do all along. The Heroes escaped from the Helicarrier and as the machine exploded, and the Helicarrier crashed into the ground. From the rubble and smoke stepped a renewed Hulk, once again shaking and cracking the Eastern Seaboard with each step. This was the moment Skaar had been waiting for.</p><p>Skaar and Hulk quickly began their brawl, with Skaar trying to anger Hulk by mentioning Caiera. This incarnation of Hulk seemed unaffected by this and brushed Skaar off as a mere annoyance... until Skaar reveals that Caiera had lived on through the planet, until he fed it to Galactus. This enraged Hulk and the two began to fight once again. Neither seemed to really have the upper-hand, but at one moment when the Hulk was down, Red She-Hulk stepped in, hit Skaar and told Hulk to run away. Naturally, Hulk refused and Skaar landed a massive blow against Red She-Hulk, sending her crashing into a parking structure containing bystanders. As Skaar wailed on Hulk, memories of Bruce's childhood flashed in his mind, specifically those of the abuse he had taken at the hands of his father. Still being beaten on by Skaar, Hulk released a sonic-clap, sending mounds of sand from the beach they were fighting on into and around the crumbling parking structure, saving the innocents inside. Skaar now saw that the monster Bruce had been training him to kill wasn't a monster at all. As he hit this realization, Hulk's emotions got the better of him and he laid Skaar to waste with a series of savage blows. Skaar reverted to his child form and told Hulk that he was done; Hulk was not the monster he thought. Hulk too returned to his human form and was struck with the emotion of all that had just happened. Red She-Hulk told him to go to Skaar, who was now quietly sobbing, and Bruce at first doubted that he could. As he reached out in apology, Skaar turned and firmly embraced him around the waist.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-241162\" href=\"/hulked-out-heroes-hulked-out-heroes/4000-241162/\" slug=\"hulked-out-heroes-hulked-out-heroes\">Hulked-Out Heroes</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-239815\" href=\"/hulk-world-war-hulks-hulk-world-war-hulks/4000-239815/\" slug=\"hulk-world-war-hulks-hulk-world-war-hulks\">Hulk: World War Hulks</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-309603\" href=\"/hulk-world-war-hulks-hulk-world-war-hulks/4000-309603/\" slug=\"hulk-world-war-hulks-hulk-world-war-hulks\">Hulk: World War Hulks HC</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-241163\" href=\"/incredible-hulk-world-war-hulks-incredible-hulk-world-war-hulks/4000-241163/\" slug=\"incredible-hulk-world-war-hulks-incredible-hulk-world-war-hulks\">Incredible Hulk: World War Hulks</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289737\" href=\"/hulk-/4000-289737/\" slug=\"hulk-\">Hulk #9</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-319673\" href=\"/the-mighty-world-of-marvel-/4000-319673/\" slug=\"the-mighty-world-of-marvel-\">The Mighty World Of Marvel #26</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-319674\" href=\"/the-mighty-world-of-marvel-/4000-319674/\" slug=\"the-mighty-world-of-marvel-\">The Mighty World Of Marvel #27</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-319675\" href=\"/the-mighty-world-of-marvel-/4000-319675/\" slug=\"the-mighty-world-of-marvel-\">The Mighty World Of Marvel #28</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-319676\" href=\"/the-mighty-world-of-marvel-/4000-319676/\" slug=\"the-mighty-world-of-marvel-\">The Mighty World Of Marvel #29</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-319677\" href=\"/the-mighty-world-of-marvel-/4000-319677/\" slug=\"the-mighty-world-of-marvel-\">The Mighty World Of Marvel #30</a></li></ul>",

Dredd witnesses the scene and wonders prophetically what would happen if \"robots discovered how to break the law\". The following prog, Judge Dredd is called to the scene of a rampage by a renegade carpenter robot named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25453\" href=\"/call-me-kenneth/4005-25453/\" slug=\"call-me-kenneth\">Call-Me-Kenneth</a> who declares his disgust of humans who have long enslaved his kind. Judge Dredd is able to dispatch the rogue robot, but the experience leaves him concerned about other robots with deadly tools going on a rampage. He presents a request to the Council of Five to destroy all \"hi-grade\" robots, which is rejected by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53935\" href=\"/chief-judge-goodman/4005-53935/\" slug=\"chief-judge-goodman\">Chief Judge Goodman</a> as robots fill an important role in Mega-City One's highly automated economy where robots fill most of the city's jobs. Judge Dredd, angered by the decision, hands in his badge and leaves the force.</p><h3>The Robot War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702424-kenneth_revolution.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702424\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0213815789474\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702424-kenneth_revolution.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702424\"><img alt=\"Call-Me-Kenneth's call to revolution\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702424-kenneth_revolution.png\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702424-kenneth_revolution.png 608w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702424-kenneth_revolution.png 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702424-kenneth_revolution.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Call-Me-Kenneth's call to revolution</figcaption></figure><p>Call-Me-Kenneth is reconstructed by a team of scientists who argue that they are able to restore the robot to working condition and end his streak by correcting a damaged \"obedience banks\". The procedure is done live and broadcasted to the city, but goes awry when the scientists' aide drops an electric lance which sends a jolt of electricity through the reconstructed robot. Call-Me-Kenneth reactivates, and with his defects unaddressed, proceeds to kill the scientists and calls on the robots of the city to rise up in rebellion against their human masters. In short time, Call-Me-Kenneth creates a disaster for Mega-City One as the Judges are unable to cope with the renegade robots, notably the \"Heavy Metal Kids\", a group of powerful industrial robots. Sensing the danger to the city, Judge Dredd returns to duty and leads a task force to try and mount a counter-offensive as thousands of citizens die from the rampaging robots.</p><p>Judge Dredd attempts to strike directly at Call-Me-Kenneth by using his robot servant, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53947\" href=\"/walter-the-wobot/4005-53947/\" slug=\"walter-the-wobot\">Walter the Wobot</a>, to guide him to where Call-Me-Kenneth is agitating the robots. Judge Dredd attempts to masquerade as a robot himself, but is caught in the act after robot sentries see Dredd is bleeding from a previous injury. Judge Dredd and Walter are apprehended and brought before Call-Me-Kenneth, who declares to Dredd he will make him a robot by removing his brain and placing it in a robot. Walter is sent to work on an assembly line with hosts of other robots. Judge Dredd blasts Call-Me-Kenneth on how he brutally treats robots serving on the assembly line, comparing him negatively to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9671\" href=\"/adolf-hitler/4005-9671/\" slug=\"adolf-hitler\">Hitler</a>. Call-Me-Kenneth informs Dredd that he is a \"fan\" of Hitler and orders him to imprisonment as he awaits for his robot to be prepared.</p><h4>Imprisonment</h4><p>As he awaits this punishment, Judge Dredd is sprung from his confines thanks to Walter, who was able to leave the assembly line and take the duty of bringing Judge Dredd food- in fact corrosive acid to break his robotic wrist cuffs. Walter informs Dredd that many robots have come to despise Call-Me-Kenneth for oppressing them and can be made to rise up against him if their programming is changed. Along with Walter and three friendly robots, Dredd is able to reprogram the assembly line robots to return to their original programing as obedient slaves to humans, prompting the new robots to fight against the other robots. Eventually, Dredd is able to turn the tide in his favor and the factory produces a steady stream of obedient robots.</p><h4>Showdown with Call-Me-Kenneth</h4><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702442\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.79833333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702442\"><img alt=\"The robots go haywire\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png 600w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The robots go haywire\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png 600w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702442-robots_turn.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The robots go haywire</figcaption></figure><p>Judge Dredd receives a communication from the Grand Hall of Justice, where Chief Judge Goodman informs him that Call-Me-Kenneth and the Heavy Metal Kids are breaking through their defenses and breaching the interior of their base. Judge Dredd realizing that the Heavy Metal Kids would be difficult to destroy, instead goes to the weather control station that controls the weather of Mega-City One. After dispatching the robot sentries in the station, Judge Dredd has the station create powerful lighting and targets it at the Heavy Metal Kids, which begin to destroy one another. Call-Me-Kenneth can not do much beyond watch his robots destroy each other and steal the clutches of victory from him. A rogue Heavy Metal Kid targets Call-Me-Kenneth, damaging him in the process. In time, the Grand Hall of Justice is secured and the Robot War put down as the renegade robots are drowned out by loyal ones.</p><h4>The end of Call-Me-Kenneth</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702445-kenneth_death.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702445\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.4840989399293\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:248.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702445-kenneth_death.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702445\"><img alt=\"Call-Me-Kenneth's final words\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" data-width=\"283\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702445-kenneth_death.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702445-kenneth_death.png 283w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Call-Me-Kenneth's final words\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702445-kenneth_death.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702445-kenneth_death.png 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" data-width=\"283\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Call-Me-Kenneth's final words</figcaption></figure><p>Call-Me-Kenneth is not found after the dust settles, leaving the Judges to issue alerts for his arrest. Judge Dredd is called to an oil port where a heavily damaged Call-Me-Kenneth is attempting to get himself more oil. Judge Dredd arrives at the station as Call-Me-Kenneth hijacks a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-58085\" href=\"/texas-city/4020-58085/\" slug=\"texas-city\">Texas City</a> tanker. In a final showdown with Judge Dredd, Call-Me-Kenneth causes massive damage to the tanker and sends oil flying out. As Judge Dredd is sent flying off the tanker, he fires at Call-Me-Kenneth, igniting the oil and destroying the tanker and Call-Me-Kenneth with it.</p><h3>Aftermath</h3><p>Chief Judge Goodman presides over a gathering of loyal robots where he awards Walter and the three robots that helped him with \"pleasure circuits\". Chief Judge Goodman also grants Walter the Wobot freedom, making him the first free robot citizen. However, much to Dredd's frustration, Walter chooses to continue working as his butler.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p>The Robot War was the first extended storyline of Judge Dredd, catapulting Judge Dredd to a main feature of 2000 AD. It is also the first strip with some obvious references to the real world, with the situation of the robots being an allegory for slavery and slave revolts. The events of the Robot War would be referenced several times in subsequent Progs, including a few immediately following that showed anti-robot mobs in garbs similar to that of the KKK attacking free robots, including Walter the Wobot.</p><p>During the events of the \"Doomsday Scenario\" nearly 20 years later in 2121, the crime boss of the Frendz organization, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82766\" href=\"/nero-narcos/4005-82766/\" slug=\"nero-narcos\">Nero Narcos</a>, references the Robot War as an influence in his planning to take over Mega-City One by using renegade robots.</p>",
