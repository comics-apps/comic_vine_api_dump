    "description": "<p> American Gothic involves the introduction of John Constantine, and what that meant for Swamp Thing. Essentially, Cosntantine works as a sort of plot driver for the series of stories that make up “American Gothic.”</p><p>An evil South-American magic cult named the Brujeria are using the Crisis on Infinite Earths to help them take over the supernatural arena, and as part of their plot, they began having all sorts of evil events take place across America. Constantine manipulates Swamp Thing into taking down these threats.</p><p>Eventually, it all leads to basically one big ol’ fight between good and evil, and literally the Ultimate Darkness against the Ultimate Light. There are a series of artists at work during this storyline – the standard brilliance of Stephen Bissette and John Totleben, but also impressive work from Rick Veitch and Stan Woch on pencils.</p><p>Moore handled the slow build towards issue #50 about as well as any writer has ever handled a build to a “big” issue number – this is a storyline without being a strict storyline (for most of the story, at least). The final battle in #50, though, is given all the trappings you would expect from a “big” issue, with Moore playing with the vast history of DC Comics and their supernatural characters.</p><p>Moore stayed on the title for a little while longer (and did some excellent work), but in many ways, this was the pinnacle of his Swamp Thing run.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>Like the pre-Crisis version, this Kara claims to be the daughter of Superman's uncle Zor-El and his wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31100\" href=\"/alura/4005-31100/\" slug=\"alura\">Alura</a>. The new Kara is actually older than Superman; she was a teenager when he was a baby. When Krypton exploded, she was sent in a rocket (in suspended animation) to find and look after Superman. However, her rocket got caught in a huge chunk of the planet and she arrived on Earth years after her cousin did. Meanwhile, she was put in suspended animation, so while chronologically born before Kal-El, she is still the age of a teenager. Her arrival is discovered by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" slug=\"batman\">Batman</a>, who initially doubted that she was really Kryptonian, thinking that it was too much of a coincidence. Not to mention he couldn't understand a thing that she said because she only spoke in Kryptonion. Kara is scared being on a unfamiliar world, and unable to understand English, not knowing about the powers she gets from being on Earth does some damage. Batman subdues her using kryptonite and brings her to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-31340\" href=\"/batcave/4020-31340/\" slug=\"batcave\">batcave</a> to conduct more research on her but she soon awakens and attempts to fly off, but is prevented from doing so by Superman. Discovered by her cousin she spends a long time at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41185\" href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/\" slug=\"fortress-of-solitude\">Fortress of Solitude</a> catching up on all the time she has missed and learning about Earth and its past. She is astonishingly able to learn all of Earths languages in just three months. During her stay at the fortress Kara does not get along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8332\" href=\"/krypto/4005-8332/\" slug=\"krypto\">Krypto</a>, Superman's dog, which makes Batman suspicious of her.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/986240-744952_supergirlpage_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-986240\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5216666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/986240-744952_supergirlpage_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-986240\"><img alt=\"Current Kara Zor-El\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16263/986240-744952_supergirlpage_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/986240-744952_supergirlpage_super.jpg 600w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16263/986240-744952_supergirlpage_super.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Current Kara Zor-El</figcaption></figure><p>She becomes restless and pleads to go out into the world, and Superman finally allows her to as long as she stays under his supervision. In her first trip to the outside world Kara and Clark go to Metropolis, where Kara learns how Clark is able to keep his identity a secret. The Amazons learn of her existence, however, and Wonder Woman (aided by Artemis and Harbinger), comes to take Kara back to their island to be properly trained in combat by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" slug=\"wonder-woman\">Wonder Woman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2359\" href=\"/artemis/4005-2359/\" slug=\"artemis\">Artemis</a>. Superman is reluctant to let her go, but grudgingly concedes, seeing it would benefit her and she would be safe. Unfortunately she doesn't stay safe. She is captured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\" href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" slug=\"darkseid\">Darkseid</a>, and after being brainwashed, attacked her own cousin.</p><p>Superman defeats her and returns her to Earth, where he fakes her death so Darkseid will not come looking for her. She then assumes the role of Supergirl. But she feels out of place, not sure where she really belongs. At the start of Kara's career as Supergirl she joins the Justice Society in a fight with Grundy but actually just watches from a distance as she talks to Star Girl who assures her they can handle it. During the battle Power Girl arrives to help the Justice Society but finds herself loosing Kara to him much to her surprise which leads Kara to save her.

    "description": "<h2><b>Background Guide</b></h2><p>In 1987, the tv show known as \"Duck Tales\" first aired. This was an animated version of the adventures of <a href=\"../../uncle-scrooge/29-21543/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scrooge McDuck</a> from his comic series \"<a href=\"../../uncle-scrooge/29-21543/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uncle Scrooge</a>\". Although the series later ended in 1990, it spanned another completely new series about an anthropomorphic duck superhero known as <a href=\"../../darkwing-duck/29-2185/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkwing Duck</a> a year later. By its end in December 1992, this new series had gained three seasons and a sizeable following. There were some characters who jumped onto this series from Duck Tales (like Gizmo Duck or even more majorly Launchpad McQuack), but through its three seasons there was never a crossover between the two series.</p><p>Fast forward to 2010. Boom Studios made a contract with the <a href=\"../../disney/57-464/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Walt Disney</a> Company to produce some Disney comics after a lack of any for several years. They could produce any series in the contract and one which was considered was <a href=\"../../darkwing-duck/49-33769/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkwing Duck</a>. After a solid run of 12 issues, it was decided to make an off shoot of that series which became Duck Tales (the comic series).</p><p>After the first arc (<a data-ref-id=\"4045-56458\" href=\"/rightful-owners/4045-56458/\" slug=\"rightful-owners\">Rightful owners</a>), however, it was announced that Disney was ordering the ending of all Disney Series published by Boom!.

    "description": "<p>Completely deluded and misinformed, <a href=\"/genesis/4005-25193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25193\">Tyler Dayspring</a> aims to get revenge on the people in his life that have caused him the most harm. His father <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a> is his prime target, but also on the list is <a href=\"/stryfe/4005-7616/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7616\">Stryfe</a> for messing with Tyler's brain, and Stryfe's supposed parents <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> and <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a>.</p><p>Tyler's first order of business is to get Stryfe in control of Cable's body so that he may destroy both men at once. (It is unclear how Tyler knew that Stryfe's psyche was embedded in Cable's after the events of the X-Cutioner's Song. It is also unclear as to why Stryfe had to be brought out instead of left dormant, since destroying Cable's body should have killed both men anyway.) Tyler enlists the help of <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mr. Sinister</a>, knowing that the man has a keen interest in the Summers bloodline. He informs Mr. Sinister that he is both Tyler Dayspring and Mr. Tolliver, a fact that Mr. Sinister should relay to Cable as a way to get Cable to search Tyler out. In addition to this message, Mr. Sinister is to release a frequency in Cable's brain that will release Stryfe so as to take over Cable's body.</p><p>Mr. Sinister does what he is asked by meeting with Cable and <a href=\"/domino/4005-2161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2161\">Domino</a> at the grave of <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/4005-10981/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10981\">Madelyne Pryor</a>. Sinister steps from the shadows and explains that Cable was more than a mere clone of Madelyne's son; Cable is in fact the son himself and Stryfe is the clone. (It is not clear how Mr. Sinister learned this truth.) He then zaps Cable in a way that releases Stryfe, who takes over Cable's body.</p><p>As Stryfe begins to hunt down Tyler Dayspring, Mother Askani sends a herald into the past to warn the family of Cable - Cyclops and Jean Grey. Before the messenger can reach the two, however, Tyler appears and takes this second Askani captive. As a captive, Askani shows Tyler the truth about many things, including that Stryfe was the clone. Tyler can't believe that Cable with his messed up body was the pure son while Stryfe was the corrupted one with his perfect body. Tyler begins to question some of the choices he's made based on his excuse of nature versus nurture. That's when Stryfe attacks.</p><p>In New York, Domino makes her way to <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor Xavier</a>, Cyclops, and Jean Grey and informs them as to what Mr. Sinister said. Cyclops is shocked that his actual son is Cable and the four head out to find him. They eventually locate Stryfe fighting Tyler and the telepaths invade Stryfe's mind. Stryfe is convinced that he was the clone and he decides to fade out of Cable's mind. Cable wakes to find Tyler already gone. Cable asks Cyclops about Madelyne.</p>",

First they sent a message that Bruce Wayne would die through the mysterious death of a John Doe. The next day, the <a href=\"/talon/4005-80530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80530\">Talon</a> attacked Bruce during a meeting with the mayoral candidate <a href=\"/lincoln-march/4005-80109/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80109\">Lincoln March</a>. Bruce would survive, and later begin to investigate the death of his Great-Great Grandfather, <a href=\"/alan-wayne/4005-77809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77809\">Alan Wayne</a>, who in his old age went mad with fears of Owls watching him. In the sewers of Gotham, where Alan died, the Talon once again appears, attacking Bruce, stripping him of his utility belt and throwing him into an intricate maze beneath the city. Bruce would be trapped in the maze for eight days, with the Court silently taunting him, driving him to the brink of insanity before the Talon stabs him from behind. Though wounded, Bruce manages to defeat the Talon, and barely escape from the maze with his life. One elderly member of the Court of Owls later decides to \"wake up\" their army of Talons, individuals who have served as the Court's Talon from as early as the 1600s, who are resting in their graves within the maze. Being revived by a mysterious girl by the name of <a href=\"/harper-row/4005-83111/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83111\">Harper Row</a>, Bruce stumbles back to the Batcave, where Alfred finds him in the connecting sewers. Bruce is shocked to find the dead body of the Talon who he had fought, restrained in the cave, but eventually goes to work, analyzing the body. He finds that not only is the Talon a man by the name of William Cobb, but he is also <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson's</a> great-grandfather and Dick was originally supposed to become a Talon.

Bruce manages to spot them coming in time, and tells <a href=\"/alfred/4005-5556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5556\">Alfred</a> to hold up in the <a href=\"/batcave/4020-31340/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31340\">Batcave</a>. Bruce manages to deflect most of the multiple Talon's attacks, but they corner him on the roof of the manor. Meanwhile, a Talon has infiltrated the Batcave and begins to stalk Alfred. Bruce manages to enter the cave by way of a secret passage in a chimney, and with the help of Alfred, they manage to trap the Talon in the cave under the giant penny. Bruce pulls a microchip from the Talon's gauntlet, and flees with Alfred to the armory while more Talons enter the cave, cutting lose the captive William Cobb, the first Talon that originally attacked Bruce weeks prior. Bruce tells Alfred to decode the chip and lower the cave's core temperature to sub zero, so the Talon's regenerative abilities would not be able to take effect. To buy Alfred more time, Bruce dawns a suit of battle armor to confront the Talons. Alfred manages to decode the Talon's microchip, and finds that they have a list of nearly every public figure in Gotham, who've they sentenced to die. Bruce orders Alfred to send out a call to all his allies in Gotham, requesting their help, as the Night of the Owls just begins.</p><p>Though a valiant effort, Bruce begins to succumb to the sheer number of Talons attacking him, as they begin to pick apart his armor. He struggles to stay alive, as the Talons inch closer and closer to finally killing him. Bruce manages to survive long enough for the cave's temperature to drop below negative 20, which causes the resident Bats to attempt to flee the cave, creating chaos around the Talons. Bruce uses the confusion as an opportunity to take down the Talons, ordering Alfred to pump the same freezing liquid through their body, like he did to Cobb. Bruce then drives into Gotham, in an effort to save as many people who are on the Talon's hit list, as he can.</p><p>After saving Jeremiah Arkham (<i>See: Detective Comics</i> #9) Bruce then attempts to save friend, and mayoral candidate <a href=\"/lincoln-march/4005-80109/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80109\">Lincoln March</a>. Entering March's office, Bruce finds him shooting a Talon with an armor piercing round. Fatally wounded, March tells Batman that he has a message for Bruce Wayne, that needs to be delivered to him as soon as possible. Through researching some of his Donations, March believes he has found the name of three Court members. With his dying breath, he tells Batman to tell Wayne that Gotham can be a good place, and it's worth saving.</p><h3>Nightwing</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355051-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.34.14_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2355051\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.89032258064516\" data-width=\"620\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 620px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355051-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.34.14_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2355051\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-width=\"620\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355051-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.34.14_pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355051-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.34.14_pm.png 620w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2355051-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.34.14_pm.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355051-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.34.14_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355051-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.34.14_pm.png 620w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2355051-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.34.14_pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-width=\"620\"></noscript></a></figure><p>While Dick Grayson is investigating a double homicide where some of his escrima sticks were found at the scene, he gets the call from Alfred Pennyworth about the Talons attacks on key public figures within Gotham. Being closest to City Hall, Dick travels there to protect Gotham's corrupt Mayor, <a href=\"/mayor-hady/4005-77370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77370\">Sebastian Hady</a>.</p><p>All while this is happening, the origin of first Talon who attacked Bruce Wayne, <a href=\"/talon/4005-80530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80530\">William Cobb</a>, his great-grandfather, is told. William's father was killed during the explosion of the Cameron Kane bridge (taking place in Batman: Gates of Gotham) leading him to preform juggling acts on the street to help provide for his mother. One day he saved a Haly's Circus worker from getting their wallet pick pocketed, and would be recruited to join the circus. Years later, he would travel back to Gotham with the circus where he met and fell in love with <a href=\"/amelia-crowne/4005-83539/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83539\">Amelia Crowne</a>, the daughter of <a href=\"/burton-crowne/4005-83538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83538\">Burton Crowne</a>, a wealthy Gothamite. Cobb would describe this as the happiest time of his life, but at the same time, the beginning of the end.</p><p>In the present, at City Hall, the attacking Talon has already killed numerous security guards and one of Hady's associates, but Dick shows up in time to save the Mayor's life. He enters a brutal fight with the Talon, ending up shoving one of his escrima stick's through the already technically dead assassin's skull, leaving him unable to regenerate. Carrying the Talon's body out, Dick feels a sharp pain, and finds multiple throwing knives in his chest. His great-grandfather William has appeared, proclaiming he is there to kill his kin, Gotham's \"Greatest betrayer.\"</p><p>Telling Hady to flee to a panic room, Dick tackles his great grandfather out a window and into the streets below, where their fight continues. All the while, William tells Dick about the legacy he betrayed. Years ago, before William became a Talon, he learned that his love Amelia had become pregnant with a son, to her father's disgust. To cover up the fact that a circus performer was the child's father, Burton made Amelia marry a second cousin, and would lock William out of his family's life from there on out. Depressed, William is offered an opportunity to change the situation, to change Gotham by one of the heads of Haly's Cirucs, it is here where he began his initiation as a Talon, and would eventually become one of the best the Court of Owls ever had. Knowing his time would eventually end, William wanted to cement his legacy, so he kidnapped his son, handing him over to be raised in the circus, proclaiming him the \"Gray son of Gotham\" as he was both a child of Gotham, but not, at the same time.</p><p>Back in the present, William scolds his great-grandson for abandoning the legacy set up for him, telling him that he's no different than himself, proclaiming Dick is an outsider to Gotham, just like him. Dick thinks different, telling William that Gotham can change, highlighting the liquid nitrogen coating to the subway power lines that had to be installed as the city grew. Before William can realize what is going on, Dick breaks open one of the tubes, freezing William, shutting down his reanimated body. As Dick picks up William's body, he tells his great-grandfather that if there's one thing he believes, it's that \"destinies don't exist.\"</p><h3>Batwing</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355046-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.29.24_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2355046\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1392931392931\" data-width=\"481\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 481px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355046-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.29.24_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2355046\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\" data-width=\"481\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355046-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.29.24_pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355046-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.29.24_pm.png 481w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2355046-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.29.24_pm.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355046-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.29.24_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355046-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.29.24_pm.png 481w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2355046-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.29.24_pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\" data-width=\"481\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Still in Gotham after chasing his brother <a href=\"/massacre/4005-79559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79559\">Massacre</a> all the way from Africa, <a href=\"/batwing/4005-77559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77559\">Batwing</a> works with his mentor <a href=\"/matu-ba/4005-79859/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79859\">Matu Ba</a> and Wayne Enterprises executive <a href=\"/lucius-fox/4005-3738/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3738\">Lucius Fox</a> on upgrading his equipment.

Singling out Burrows, the Talon reveals that he had been contracted to kill Burrows' colonial ancestor and family, but one of the boys managed to survive the attack, thus why he was picked specifically for this target, so he could finish the job. Before he manages to do, Damian shoots a grappling hook through the assassin, stringing him up by a tree branch. Damian grabs one of the Talon's swords, telling the assassin that he somewhat sympathises with him, seeing as they were both used to do other's biddings, relating his own situation to his mother, <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/4005-4917/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4917\">Talia al Ghul</a>, before he decapitates the Talon, ending his pursuit once and for all.</p><h3>Birds of Prey</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355048-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.30.43_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2355048\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.72364217252396\" data-width=\"626\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 626px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355048-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.30.43_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2355048\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" data-width=\"626\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355048-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.30.43_pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355048-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.30.43_pm.png 626w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2355048-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.30.43_pm.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355048-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.30.43_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2355048-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.30.43_pm.png 626w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2355048-screen_shot_2012_05_20_at_12.30.43_pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" data-width=\"626\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Very soon after learning of the night's events and seeing that <a href=\"/poison-ivy/4005-1697/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1697\">Poison Ivy</a> had been attacked, <a href=\"/black-canary/4005-1689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1689\">Black Canary</a> and <a href=\"/katana/4005-9547/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9547\">Katana</a> are attacked by the Talon formerly known as <a href=\"/henry-ballard/4005-83792/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83792\">Henry Ballard</a>.

And then, someone knocks on the door, everybody is shocked to see <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Barry Allen</a>, the Flash before Wally West and his uncle and mentor who died, alive and well.</p><p>A week later, Jay and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a> (the Green Lantern) are happy to see Barry alive who according to Barry himself, reformed from a being of energy into a human during Wally's fight with <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/doctor-alchemy/4005-19089/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19089\">Doctor Alchemy</a>. He could not remember who he is until he visited <a href=\"/flash-museum/4020-50067/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50067\">Flash Museum</a> and stole one of the older Flash costumes he found there and the next thing he did was found Jay and Wally. While Wally is very skeptical about Barry's return, according to Hal's ring, Barry is telling the truth and Hal tells Wally that he should not worry. He knew Barry for a long time as they were best friends. And then, Hal takes of.</p><p>As they walk out on the streets, Barry sees his old enemy, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-piper/4005-10472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10472\">Pied Piper</a> and attacks him with full force, extremely aggressive and unusual behavior for Barry. As Wally tells him that Piper is his friend now, Barry is skeptical because of the fact that Wally revealed his secret identity to the public but before the two could end the discussion, Piper informs Wally that there is a gang war going on and it is about to turn the city upside down. As Wally suits up, Barry compliments his new costume while Wally was just asking himself what will Barry's reaction be as he never told him he is the new Flash now.</p><p>Just as they stopped the assassination of Jack Giacamo, Barry tells Wally to avoid for him and he needs to take care of it. Wally followed him and he saw Barry visiting the grave of his wife <a href=\"/iris-west-allen/4005-9977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9977\">Iris</a>. He remembers how happy they were, especially when she accepted his proposal and tells her he loves her. Barry thinks about how proud she would be if she saw Wally in action and he knows that Wally does not believe him. However, Wally heard everything Barry said and tells him he is sorry for not believe he came back. His death hurt him pretty badly and he wasn't happy when he saw him, he was afraid. Tomorrow starts a new year and people have to move on with their lives. And just like that, the two speedsters run together.</p><p>Few weeks later, Wally and Jay stop a gang of high tech equipped commanders. Unfortunately, the train ran out of control and was about to crush civilians. Jay and Wally were unable to stop it but with Barry's help, they were successful. Civilians ask the Flash for autographs but just as Wally was about to give them, Barry is the one who wrote the autographs. Back home, he talks to Linda about taking a different name considering the fact that Barry came back and wants to move out of the city which Linda does not really agree with. As the two laugh over different ideas for Wally's potential new alias, Jay calls, telling them that the commanders they fought on the train took over a warehouse but before he could go there, Wally saw Barry standing in the same alley he came back from. He feels weird considering the fact that he was dead for years but to him, it all seemed like seconds. The two speedsters start walking but it seems that there is a book next to a trash container. During the fight, the commanders shot laser at Wally that tore the ground apart, slamming pieces of rock on to Wally. The commander screams he killed the Flash and at the moment he heard it, Barry asked him what he said and blitzed the commander with rage in his eyes, beating him up. Wally stopped Barry from beating the commander to death. Wally believed Barry acted that way because he thought the commander killed Wally but what Barry actually said that nobody else heard is Barry screaming how he is the Flash. He almost killed the man for calling someone the Flash other than himself.</p><p>Wally asks himself what is happening to Barry as he never acted the way he does now. He reads a message from Pied Piper about the new location of the commanders. Meanwhile Jay Garrick visits his own friend from World War II, one of the original speedsters <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/johnny-quick/4005-36717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36717\">Johnny Champers</a>, or as he is commonly known, Johnny Quick. He asks him for help but they both agree they will need <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/max-mercury/4005-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2379\">Max Mercury</a> for this problem as well. They meet Max who currently sells metro tokens. Max for reasons unknown claims that he is not Max Mercury and they got the wrong guy. Jay drops his tokens, making Max reveal his reflexes and reminds Max that he owns him one. As he agrees, Jay gives Max his old costume which he kept all those years because he wanted to remember him. While Wally was reaching his location, Barry met him and they team up. However they were trapped in a force field they can't penetrate or phase throw. Wally finds a way to save Barry and vibrates on the force field to allow him to phase throw and as he asks Barry to help him. Barry refuses, telling him he stole his name and identity, trying to make Barry Allen a forgotten history but he will make everyone remember who Barry Allen was and still is, by destroying <a href=\"/central-city/4020-54995/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54995\">Central City</a>. Wally begs Barry to understand he never wanted to replace him, he wanted to honor his memory but Barry does not listen and leaves him to die. Wally only focuses on vibration and phases through the force field. He comes back home and sees Barry on TV having a Press Conference where he said that his protege Wally West, former Kid Flash is not dead. Hearing it, Wally throws his costume in the trash, feeling nothing but grief.</p><p>Barry started to terrorize Central City which drew the attention of Darkstar who tried to kill him but was stopped by Hal Jordan. However, Hal chased Barry to the Flash Museum, asking him why he is doing all of this but Barry only wants to make them remember him and beats up Hal. While Darkstar tried to kill him again, Barry got away.</p><p>Next day, Barry attacked construction workers at construction site but they were all saved by Jay Garrick, Johnny Quick and Max Mercury. Despite their combined efforts, they were unable to stop Barry who left construction site once the news helicopter was about the crash but the reporters were saved by Jay and Max. Meanwhile Wally came to the alley where Barry appeared when he was resurrected and he found a book about the Flash from a homeless person nearby which gave him the answer about all this crisis.</p><p>Johnny, Max and Jay meet Wally, talking about his speed. Johnny mentions the formula he invented which gave him super speed. Max is trying to train Wally and teach him how to get faster and tells Wally how he is afraid of replacing Barry which limits his powers. Jay on the other hand tells Wally he deserved the name the Flash and from now on he will call him that way and will no longer use the word junior. After Wally showed them the book he found, he had an idea how to stop Barry and he went to the Flash Museum. Jay, Johnny and Max were searching for Barry who freed all of the prisoners from their cells and starting a riot which was easily stopped by Johnny and Max but Barry defeated Jay in a fight by breaking his leg and he knocked down Max and Johnny. He ran back to the Flash Museum, just the place where Wally waited for him to show up. Wally gave him the ring with the suit inside which looked familiar. Wally find out everything. Somehow he did not full them but himself which made Hal's ring think he was saying the truth. He was confused because he dropped the book which was revealed to be <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-life-story-of-the-flash-1-the-life-story-of-th/4000-220330/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-220330\">The Life Story of The Flash</a>, Barry's biography from life to death. It could not have been written in this time because it is from the future. As Wally tells the man who everyone thought was Barry Allen all this time all this, the man puts on a suit and it was revealed that all this time, the man who claimed to be Barry was actually <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/professor-zoom/4005-18340/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18340\">Professor Zoom</a>, the Reverse Flash, Eobard Thawne, Barry's arch enemy from the 25th Century.</p><p>Two speedsters, one good and one evil start to fight at the remains of the Flash Museum, Wally tells Professor Zoom how Barry killed him years ago by snapping his neck in order to stop him from killing his fiance. Thawne explains how he still did not meet Barry Allen. He came from the timeline where technology was so advanced the crime did not exist but it was also the era without super heroes. However, there were people who felt nostalgia for super heroes. Thawne was one of them. He adored Barry Allen. He was worshipping him, he was his hero. Thawne was always reading about him, he knew everything about Barry and the only thing he wanted is to meet his hero. He changed his face to make himself look like Barry and wanted to use the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55680\">Cosmic Treadmill</a> to travel back in time and meet his hero before he died by replicating the accident that gave Barry his super speed. However, Thawne traveled into the wrong era, years after Barry's death. Thawne visited the Flash Museum, realizing he was brought to this timeline for a reason, to continue the legacy of Barry Allen and become the new Flash of this timeline. Because of his new goal, he begin to study various enemies of the Flash, especially the Reverse Flash, his greatest enemy. Because the Reverse Flash's name was unknown in this timeline and in the 25th Century, Thawne did not know that he was Reverse Flash and when he found out his future identity plus the fact that his greatest hero will be his murderer, the shock put Thawne in the state of extreme confusion and madness, making him believe that he was Barry Allen.</p><p>Wally plans on stopping Thawne but he has no chance as he is much faster than Wally. Thawne will not allow himself to be removed from this timeline as he is away from Barry and the events of his death so he tries to destroy the cosmic treadmill. But because the treadmill is the item that gave Thawne access to his timeline which is the only thing preventing him from dying at the hands of Barry Allen, Wally tells him not to destroy the treadmill or he will reset the timeline. Because of that, Thawne refuses to destroy the treadmill and escapes after Wally was saved by Max, Johnny and the Green Lantern. In the hospital where Jay is right now, Wally plans to send Thawne back to his timeline where he will eventually become Reverse Flash once again. Max once again reminds him how he needs to stop being afraid of replacing Barry by becoming his equal. On the news, Thawne admits he is the one who was terrorizing the city, not the Flash who is indeed dead. As he was about to kill Linda, he was stopped by Thawne who easily defeated Wally once again. When he finally admitted he was afraid of replacing Barry, Wally realizes his speed never left him, it was just limited by his own psychic blocks and not they returned. Wally overpowers Thawne who begs for mercy, but Wally only mocks him, calling him pathetic and a victim of his own obsession. Wally jumps on the cosmic treadmill, telling Thawne how he might travel into the future and terrorize him like he terrorized him, or maybe even kill him. As Thawne uses the treadmill to travel into the future to stop Wally, it turns out that Wally just ran so fast it looked like he disappeared. He wanted Thawne to travel into the future in order to set the timeline the way it was suppose to be.</p><p>The Flash Museum was repaired after getting destroyed in Thawne's fight with Hal but now they added the statue of Wally West next to his mentor Barry. Wally finally gets out of his uncle's shadow but he knows he will always be there watching for him. Wally looks at Barry's biography which turned out to be written by his Aunt Iris, Barry's wife and she is about to write it only few years from now, meaning that she was alive and not killed by Thawne. Wally throws the book into the river because he can't find out what the history has in store for him, because his history belongs only to him.</p>",

The Justice League Dark transports themselves to Gotham with the help of Shade's M-vest, and the effects of Cain's magic siphoning are immediately felt, as the M-vest begins to malfunction. The team comes across Batgirl, aka <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\" href=\"/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/\" slug=\"barbara-gordon\">Barbara Gordon</a> fighting a gang of vampires. She informs the team briefly of what the situation is before she's called to another part of the city by Batman. Xanadu believes that the key to defeating Cain is retrieving Andrew from the realm of the dead, tasking Constantine and Deadman to do so, while she enters an astral plain, seeking for more help, while leaving her physical body in danger.</p><p>While Constantine and Deadman try to retrieve Andrew from the realm of the dead, Shade attempts to transport Zatanna and Xanadu's body to a safer location, but ends up on a rooftop where Batman, Tig, and John are fending off more vampires. With his allies in danger, Batman is forced to leave, leaving Zatanna in charge. As more and more vampires close in, while Zatanna and Shade's magic continues to weaken, Mary appears on the rooftop, entering a fragile alliance with the heros, as Cain angered her by taking the army she spent years trying to create.</p><p>Cain eventually releases a burst of magic energy, strengthening his vampire army, while heroes like Barbara Gordon, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\" href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" slug=\"dick-grayson\">Dick Grayson</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1698\" href=\"/catwoman/4005-1698/\" slug=\"catwoman\">Catwoman</a>, Batman and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\" href=\"/damian-wayne/4005-42413/\" slug=\"damian-wayne\">Damian Wayne</a> do their best to fend off the beasts. While all this is happening, Andrew remains on a plain between life and death, neither heaven or hell, forced to watch the chaos, as a mysterious voice speaks to him, blaming him for the events at hand.</p><p>While chaos reigns in Gotham, Constantine and Deadman find Andrew within purgatory, asking him to come back in order to defeat Cain. Andrew denies the request, claiming that he is emotionally defeated, having no fight left in him. Meanwhile, in the astral zone of the Crystal One, Xanadu requests that the magical being help shift the tides of magic, in order to help defeat Cain, to which the Crystal One agrees. Xanadu wakes up back in Gotham, weakened, and to the sight of Shade having a complete metal breakdown, leading to his M-Vest to take him to a place outside reality where he meets his dead love <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25164\" href=\"/kathy-george/4005-25164/\" slug=\"kathy-george\">Kathy George</a>, never to be seen again. In an effort to go out fighting, Zatanna, Xanadu and Mary decide to attempt an attack on Cain, but find he's too powerful, leaving Zatanna to use the last of her magic to transport to Robinson Park, where Cain and his army follow. Deadman and Constantine show up empty handed. With the makeshift team seemingly defeated, and Cain's army closing in, the winds begin to blow, as the Crystal One's powers begin to take effect, as a resurrected Andrew Bennett appears before them, saying he found a little fight left in him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2313562-screen_shot_2012_04_25_at_4.50.37_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2313562\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.93675527039413\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2313562-screen_shot_2012_04_25_at_4.50.37_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2313562\"><img alt=\"Andrew leading the Vampries\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2313562-screen_shot_2012_04_25_at_4.50.37_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2313562-screen_shot_2012_04_25_at_4.50.37_pm.png 1091w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66303/2313562-screen_shot_2012_04_25_at_4.50.37_pm.png 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2313562-screen_shot_2012_04_25_at_4.50.37_pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Andrew leading the Vampries</figcaption></figure><p>Proclaiming that he has been made the exact opposite of Cain, Andrew uses his new powers to take control of the vampire horde, telling Mary that he's \"seen the error of his ways\" as the two lovers embrace and kiss. With the horde holding Cain, Andrew decapitates the primordial vampire, ending his threat. The Justice League Dark remains ever wary of Andrew, seeing that it seems that in order to defeat Cain, Xanadu traded one vampire threat for another. Mary calls for the horde to once again attack humanity, but Andrew stops her, saying they've exposed their secret too much, he then uses his new powers to make the world forget about that night, with the exception of the Justice League Dark and his associates. Before Andrew leads his kind to a new life, he's confronted by Constantine, but Andrew assures him that there are bigger threats to be dealt with, and when the time comes, he will give them his aid. With Andrew and Mary gone, Andrew's old friend initiates the \"plan b\" he and Andrew had previously discussed, telling Tig that they had to inform the Order of Van Helsings of recent events, a group John describes as \"worse\" than the vampires...</p>",
