Batman is more alone than ever after the apparent death of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6156\" href=\"/stephanie-brown/4005-6156/\" slug=\"stephanie-brown\">Stephanie Brown</a>, and the realization that his friends and teammates wiped his memories years ago after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1790\" href=\"/sue-dibny/4005-1790/\" slug=\"sue-dibny\">Sue Dibny's</a> rape, in the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-48398\" href=\"/identity-crisis/4045-48398/\" slug=\"identity-crisis\">Identity Crisis</a> storyline. With Black Mask rising to power, and Batman struggling to protect Gotham, a new vigilante comes on to the scene, calling himself the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\" href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" slug=\"jason-todd\">Red Hood</a>, a monicker once used by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\" href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" slug=\"joker\">Joker</a>. Red Hood meets with many of Black Masks' drug lords and informs them he will be taking over the trade, offering them a better deal, but demanding they don't sell to children. To show them that he's serious, he throws them a duffle bag full of the severed heads of their lieutenants, and leaves.</p><p>Batman eventually comes across the Red Hood when he and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\" href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" slug=\"dick-grayson\">Nightwing</a> find him intercepting a package for Black Mask which contains <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3737\" href=\"/amazo/4005-3737/\" slug=\"amazo\">Amazo</a>. After fighting off Amazo, Batman gives chase to Red Hood but can't catch him. Analyzing Red Hood's agility and tactics, Batman realizes he's been trained by someone, he's good.</p><p>Black Mask becomes more and more frustrated with Red Hood knocking over his operations, and once Red Hood intercepts a shipment of kryptonite, Black Mask hires <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3715\" href=\"/mr-freeze/4005-3715/\" slug=\"mr-freeze\">Mr. Freeze</a> in order to kill him. Batman shows up to the fight, as he had been tracking both Red Hood's and Black Masks' actions. While fighting off Freeze, Red Hood gives subtle hints as to who he really is, causing Batman to question one of the truest things he believes in, logic.</p><p>With an haunted mind, Batman departs Gotham City for a short time to speak with his allies and \"friends.\" He speaks to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a> about coming back to life, but Superman reminds Batman that he never truly died. Next he speaks to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\" href=\"/green-arrow/4005-5936/\" slug=\"green-arrow\">Green Arrow</a>, who was one of the members of the JLA that mind-wiped him, about the same subject. Their meeting is tense, with Batman letting on to the fact that he knows what was done to him. Finally, he meets with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\" href=\"/zatanna/4005-5691/\" slug=\"zatanna\">Zatanna</a>, the woman who mind wiped him, at one of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\" href=\"/ras-al-ghul/4005-40816/\" slug=\"ras-al-ghul\">Ra's al Ghul's</a> closed <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40817\" href=\"/lazarus-pit/4055-40817/\" slug=\"lazarus-pit\">lazarus pits</a>. Zatanna reminds Batman that he had closed all of Ra's' pits, and questions why he called on her. Batman simply responds \"I needed someone I could trust... But I had to settle for you\" before he leaves.</p><p>Elsewhere, Joker, beaten, and driven out of Gotham City, sits within an abandoned carnival where he is approached by a figure within the shadows. After giving a half hearted threat of \"Don't you know who I am? I'll kill you\" to his visitor, Joker looks up to see a crowbar coming at his face. Red Hood mercilessly beats Joker with the crowbar, very similarly to the way Joker beat the second <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\" href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" slug=\"robin\">Robin</a>, Jason Todd, with a crowbar, prior to setting off a bomb which killed him. When Red Hood stops, he takes off his mask, and sure enough, he's revealed to be Jason Todd, back from the dead.</p><p>With his back against the wall more than ever, Black Mask agrees to join <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40433\" href=\"/secret-society-of-super-villains/4060-40433/\" slug=\"secret-society-of-super-villains\">the Society</a>, a group of super-villains banding together prior to <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\" href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" slug=\"infinite-crisis\">Infinite Crisis</a> on the condition that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3588\" href=\"/deathstroke/4005-3588/\" slug=\"deathstroke\">Deathstroke</a> sends some operatives to kill Red Hood once and for all. Deathstroke sends (to Black Masks' displeasure) <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24925\" href=\"/captain-nazi/4005-24925/\" slug=\"captain-nazi\">Captain Nazi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31111\" href=\"/hyena/4005-31111/\" slug=\"hyena\">Hyena</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19006\" href=\"/count-vertigo/4005-19006/\" slug=\"count-vertigo\">Count Vertigo</a> to deal with Red Hood. While the trio gets the jump on Red Hood, Batman eventually comes to fight with him, fending off the Society's assassins. The fight ends with Red Hood killing Captain Nazi to Batman's shock. Red Hood informs Batman that he is what the city needs, and he'll do what Batman won't.</p><p>During their next meeting, Batman chases Red Hood through out the city, determined to end his reign of chaos once and for all. In a brutal fist to fist fight, Red Hood manages to unmask Batman. Figuring he'd make it \"fair\" he decides to reveal himself as well, and reveals to Bruce for the first time that he is actually Jason Todd. Bruce refuses to believe what he's seeing, but Jason offers up a blood and tissue sample, to satisfy Bruce's need for logic, and assures his former mentor that it is indeed him, and he is alive. Bruce returns to the Batcave where he confirms, Red Hood is the one and only Jason Todd.</p><p>Red Hood eventually meets with Black Mask in order to work out a truce. One of the conditions is that Black Mask must masacre all of his top men, which he does. When Red Hood arrives, he doesn't give Black Mask the deal he's looking for, and the two start to fight. With Batman rushing to the scene, he comes to find Black Mask stabbing Red Hood in the heart. Batman is afraid that once again, he has failed to save Jason's life, but it turns out that the man Black Mask killed was a body double, and Jason gives Batman a hint as to where he actually is. <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55715\" href=\"/crime-alley/4020-55715/\" slug=\"crime-alley\">Crime alley</a>, where Batman was born.</p><p>Bruce meets Jason on the rooftops and quickly gives chase to him. Elsewhere, Deathstroke, and the Society drop <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10004\" href=\"/chemo/4005-10004/\" slug=\"chemo\">Chemo</a> onto <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55771\" href=\"/bludhaven/4020-55771/\" slug=\"bludhaven\">BlÃ¼dhaven</a>, Gotham's sister city, destroying it. Batman witnesses the blast and immediately becomes distracted, worrying about Nightwing. Jason laughs at the irony of one Robin coming back from the dead and the other dying, but prevents Bruce from leaving, demanding he stay and finish their fight. Bruce obliges, and brutally beats the living hell out of Jason.</p><p>The fight ends up in an abandoned apartment. Bruce tries to talk Jason down, but Jason tells him he's not mad at Bruce for not being able to save him in time, what he's mad at is that the Joker is still alive. Jason kicks open a closet to reveal the Joker tied up, and bloodied. Joker laughs at the situation, commending Jason on coming back all the way from the dead in order to set up the \"family reunion.\" Jason throws Bruce a gun and gives him an ultimatum, kill Joker now, or he will. Jason continues to say that the only way to stop him from killing the Joker would be for Bruce to kill him first.</p><p>Bruce stares at the gun, and tells Jason that the reason he never killed the Joker before is that it would be too easy. There's not a day where he doesn't think about killing him with his own bare hands, but if he was ever to cross that line, there would be no going back. Bruce drops the gun and begins to walk away with Jason screaming at him. Jason points the gun towards Bruce and fires. Bruce avoids the bullet, and throws a batarang into the barrel before Jason can fire another round, causing it to explode in his hand when he does. Thinking it's over, Bruce is shocked to find that Jason sets off a timer for the building to explode. He tries to save Jason, but Joker tackles him, hysterically laughing, claiming he's the only one who gets what he wants. Bruce punches Joker off him, and in the last second is able to save Jason, and shield himself from the blast.</p><p>When Bruce comes too in the wreckages, he finds Joker, barely alive, and laughing. Jason is nowhere to be found. All Bruce can come to do is yell out his name.</p><p>It is later revealed that due to the events in Infinite Crisis, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\" href=\"/superboy-prime/4005-40756/\" slug=\"superboy-prime\">Superboy Prime</a> punches the walls of reality, which \"corrects\" mistakes that were never supposed to happen, in the past, present, and future. Jason Todd's death was one of these mistakes. Months after his death, he was brought back to life, and forced to dig himself out of his own coffin. Heavily brain damaged, he was brought to a hospital where he eventually escaped and lived on the streets for some time until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4917\" href=\"/talia/4005-4917/\" slug=\"talia\">Talia al'Ghul</a> found him. Talia nursed Jason back to health, and despite her father's wishes, threw him in a lazarus pit, causing his memories to come back. Jason would spend the next few years training, until he teams up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9588\" href=\"/hush/4005-9588/\" slug=\"hush\">Hush</a> to confront Bruce for the first time, but leads Bruce to believe that it was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9589\" href=\"/clayface/4005-9589/\" slug=\"clayface\">Clayface</a> mocking him. After that confrontation, Jason decides to take up the former alias of the Joker, the man who killed him, and come back to Gotham as the Red Hood.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-36578\" href=\"/batman-under-the-hood/4050-36578/\" slug=\"batman-under-the-hood\">Batman: Under the Hood</a></li></ul>",

The Book of the Black manages to capture all the New Guardians but Jordan. Meanwhile, on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">Oa</a>, Krona returns and attacks the Guardians, possessing them with the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55823\" href=\"/emotional-embodiments/4015-55823/\" slug=\"emotional-embodiments\">Emotional Embodiments</a>, and returning <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\" href=\"/parallax/4005-41293/\" slug=\"parallax\">Parallax</a> to the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\" href=\"/central-power-battery/4055-55704/\" slug=\"central-power-battery\">Central Power Battery</a>, restoring the impurity within the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">Green Power Rings</a>. Krona is then able to control all of the Green Lanterns, minus Hal Jordan, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\" href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" slug=\"kyle-rayner\">Kyle Rayner</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\" href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" slug=\"john-stewart\">John Stewart</a>, Guy Gardner, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6952\" href=\"/kilowog/4005-6952/\" slug=\"kilowog\">Kilowog</a>, and Ganthet, as they had already been possessed by Parallax before, and show a slight resistance to the fear embodiment's effect. Kyle Rayner and John Stewart began to feel the effects of the Kronas influence though and began to fight as well as Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner. Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner were able to meet on a Safe House planet that the Green Lantern Corps established just in case the security of Oa was put into jeopardy. Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner duked it out for a bit before they both decided that they needed take off their rings in order to avoid Krona being able to extend his influence on them. Ganthet blew up his hand in order to remove the rings from both Kyle Rayner and John Stewart before they killed each other. Hal Jordan was able to activate a ship that was located on the safe house planet and made his way to Oa with Guy Gardner. Once there, Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner and John Stewart are able to meet up and Hal pulls out the rings that the other Guardians of the Emotional Spectrum dropped before they were sucked into the Book of the Dead. He suggest that since they were unable to weld their Green Power Rings in order to escape Kronas influence they should each wield one of the powers rings from the other Corps. Hal Jordan takes the Yellow Spectrum, Kyle Rayner accepts the Blue Spectrum. John Stewart accepts the Indigo Spectrum (although his first choice was to take the Orange Spectrum but Hal explained to him how much it would change him and how it just did not go with John Stewarts personality) and Guy Gardner accepts the Red Spectrum Ring. As the Earth Lanterns accept the rings they are attacked by a squadron of Green Lanterns and are forced to go deeper into the heart of Oa underground. While attempting to reach the core of Oa Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner come across an old antique room that was built by the Guardians that none of the lanterns knew about. In this room there were many objects including an old Manhunter robot and also the first piece of technology that was used to harness the willpower of the Green Light Spectrum. This device is held to be even more powerful than a Green Lantern ring by itself as when Guy put it on he stated that it felt as if he had 10 Green Lantern power rings on. Moments later though they are attacked by an older Green Lantern who had been put there by the Guardians in order to protect the facility and especially the Krona Guantlet. Kyle stops the fight and convinces the Lantern that they are indeed allies and that they were not attempting to steal anything. The attacker leaves and moments later a computer comes online and shows that Mogo is creating a massive amount of Green Lantern rings and sending them to different sectors all over the Universe. Kyle at this points sides with John and tell the other Lanterns that this has now become their most pressing matter since Kronas army is growing by the minute soon there will be thousands of beings on Oa under Kronas control hunting them down and the War will be lost. John then uses his ring to transport Kyle and himself to Mogo (an ability that is inherent among the rings of the Indigo tribe).</p><p>Jordan and Gardner eventually make their way to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">Oa</a>, meeting with Rayner and Stewart. Unable to use their <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">Green Power rings</a> due to Parallax's influence, Jordan suggests they use the rings of the other corps Jordan took from Ryut. Jordan dawns the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-53415\" href=\"/sinestro-corps-ring/4055-53415/\" slug=\"sinestro-corps-ring\">Sinestro Corps Ring</a>, Gardner the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55723\" href=\"/red-power-ring/4055-55723/\" slug=\"red-power-ring\">Red</a>, Stewart the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55736\" href=\"/indigo-power-staff/4055-55736/\" slug=\"indigo-power-staff\">Indigo</a>, and Rayner the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55735\" href=\"/blue-power-ring/4055-55735/\" slug=\"blue-power-ring\">Blue</a>. The four former Green Lanterns decide to try and extract Parallax from the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\" href=\"/central-power-battery/4055-55704/\" slug=\"central-power-battery\">Green Power Battery</a>, but have to fight off a Prallax controlled <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41919\" href=\"/mogo/4005-41919/\" slug=\"mogo\">Mogo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55823\" href=\"/emotional-embodiments/4015-55823/\" slug=\"emotional-embodiments\">Emotional Embodiment</a> possessed <a data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-universe\">Guardians of the Universe</a> in the process. Kyle and the other Earth Lanterns go underground in order to escape the onslaught of the mind controlled Green Lanterns. While there they attempt to devise a plan of attack when the Earth Lanterns reach a fork in the road. Hal believes that the primary mission was to remove Parallax from the Central Battery and John believes that their biggest threat at that moment in time was the planet Green Lantern Mogo. An argument ensues and Kyle attempts to calm everyone down and tells them that it should be put to a vote. They all decide that they should head to the Central Battery and attempt to remove Parallax and Hals rings shows them the path to travel underground in order to reach it. On their way there they notice an underground facility constructed by the Guardians that hold some of their most darkest secrets. There is an old inactive Manhunter there as well as the Krona Gauntlet. The Krona Gauntlet was the first piece of technology created that had the ability tap into the energy of Will and create constructs based upon a users thoughts. This device is held to be even powerful than a Green Lantern ring by itself as when Guy put it on he stated that it felt as if he had 10 Green Lantern rings on. Moments later though they are attacked by an older Green Lantern who had been put there by the Guardians in order to protect the facility and especially the Krona Guantlet. Kyle stops the fight and convinces the Lantern that they are indeed allies and that they were not attempting to steal anything. The attacker leaves and moments later a computer comes online and shows that Mogo is creating a massive amount of Green Lantern rings and sending them to different sectors all over the Universe. Kyle at this points sides with John and tell the other Lanterns that this has now become their most pressing matter since Kronas army is growing by the minute soon there will be thousands of beings on Oa under Kronas control hunting them down and the War will be lost. John then uses his ring to transport Kyle and himself to Mogo (an ability that is inherent among the rings of the Indigo tribe). Once they arrive there they are almost immediately attack and the plunge into the core of Mogo in order to help restore him. Mogo attempts to access their thoughts and create constructs of people that they care about and attempts to convince them to go back but they press on. Once they reach Mogos center Kyle attempts to cure his mind using the energy of the Blue Lantern ring to no success. They notice that the energy of the Black Lanterns is causing interference since towards the end of Black Night Mogo took in their energies while they were attacking him and stated that they would burn at his core for all Eternity. Seeing that there is no way to cure Mogo and that he is too far under Kronas control John decided to tap into the power of the Black energy and uses it to form a weapon and destroys Mogo completely. Kyle, horrified by Johns actions, attempts to gather pieces of Mogo together in order to restart his core but they fall apart. Later on John and Kyle meet back with Hal and Guy and Ganthet and attempt to use the full power of all the different Corps ring to crack open the Central Power battery and release Parallax. While their combined effort was unable to continue as they were under attack by other Corps members. Guy Gardner with the Red Ring of Rage and the Star Sapphire Ring of Compassion manages to break open the Central Battery and releases Parallax from the Central Power Battery. The other Lanterns are then broken from Kronas control and being preparations for their final showdown with the New Guardian Entities and Krona. In the final battle against the renegade Guardian Krona, Kyle was able to use the Book of Black by drawing a picture inside of it essentially \"willing\" the other New Guardians back into the normal realm.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><h3>First Story</h3><p>The Big Time story arc mainly deals with Peter's luck getting better. As <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>, he has become a much more respected member of the Super-Hero community. Additionally, thanks to <a href=\"/marla-jameson/4005-10671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10671\">Marla Jameson</a>, Peter has become a think tank scientist at Horizon Labs under the employ of known scientist <a href=\"/max-modell/4005-74419/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74419\">Max Modell</a>. However, the <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a> hires Rodrick Kingsley, the Hobgoblin, to steal from the lab a metal called Reverbium that acts as a substitute for <a href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">Vibranium</a>. However, Kingsley is murdered by a crazed <a href=\"/phil-urich/4005-2246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2246\">Phil Urich</a> who takes his mantle and takes on the mission Kingpin assigned to him. On Peter's first day at Horizon Labs, the lab is attacked by the new Hobgoblin who is using new weapons. After a fight with Spider-Man, Phil steals the Reverbium and delivers it to Kingpin who allows Phil to work for him. Spider-Man designs himself a new Stealth suit to overcome Phil's Goblin Laugh which incapacitated him in their previous and along with the <a href=\"/black-cat/4005-1479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\">Black Cat</a>, he goes to take down Kingpin and Hobgoblin and steal back the reverbium. At Fisk Towers, Spider-Man and the Black Cat fight the Hobgoblin, Kingpin and his Hand Ninjas but in the end the reverbium is destroyed along with Fisk Towers, and Hobgoblin and Kingpin escape. But despite everything Peter is now living a life with his dignity intact as he now has a new girlfriend, a new apartment and a proud Aunt May and Jay Sr.</p><h3>Second Story</h3><p><a href=\"/alistair-smythe/4005-6292/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6292\">Alistair Smythe</a> and his Spider-Slayers are back and taking aim at Mayor <a href=\"/j-jonah-jameson/4005-1487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J. Jonah Jameson</a> and his astronaut son John once again. Smythe returns <a href=\"/mac-gargan/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Mac Gargan</a> to his Scorpion identity and attacks the launch site where John is flying the Vertex shuttle into orbit which will meet up with a Horizon Labs space station. Spider-Man appears and weblines to a shuttle that just took off but Smythe has locked down the controls and rigged its booster rockets to explode before it leaves the atmosphere and to make matters worse, the evolved Scorpion appears to kill Spider-Man. With the help of the <a href=\"/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\">New Avengers</a>, Spider-Man saves John but Smythe sends his <a href=\"/army-of-insects/4060-58079/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58079\">Insect Army</a> after Jonah's loved ones. Spider-Man uses a device that jams all of Smythe's minions' enhanced senses but disables his own Spider-Sense in the process. After Spider-Man defeats the Scorpion, he goes to check on the others but Smythe appears and kills <a href=\"/marla-jameson/4005-10671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10671\">Marla Jameson</a>. Spider-Man then defeats Smythe and for the first time, Jonah refuses to blame Spider-Man and blames himself instead.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1622742-avengers_87.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1622742\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5366876310273\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1622742-avengers_87.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1622742\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man leads the Avengers\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/1622742-avengers_87.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1622742-avengers_87.jpg 477w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/1622742-avengers_87.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></a><figcaption>Spider-Man leads the Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>The story starts with Spider-Man leading the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> and the Black Cat against <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Doctor Octopus's</a> Octo-Bots that are invading the city.

The Hobgoblin then gets bored of fighting and resumes his mission in retrieving the reverbium and despite the weakened Spider-Man's efforts, Hobgoblin easily fends him off and steals a portion of the reverbium before escaping.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1534502\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5515625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1534502\"><img alt=\"Hobgoblin vs Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg 1280w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg 412w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hobgoblin vs Spider-Man\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg 1280w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1534502-gobby.jpg 412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hobgoblin vs Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man quickly gets back to his lab, hides his costume in the black box, washes the blood off but is unable to put some clothes on in time because Modell, the cops and the others enter the lab to check in on him and they are all shocked to see Peter, half-naked writing equations on a board. He pretends having not heard of the Goblin's attack because he had his headphones on and writing half-naked was his own way of working.</p><p>The Hobgoblin delivers the reverbium to Fisk Towers. The Kingpin realizes that this Goblin is not the man he hired and although he is initially unpleased with this turn of events, and despite his right hand man Montana's protests, he allows Phil to carry on Kingsley's mission since he never liked Kingsley in the first place.</p><p>Back at Horizon labs, Modell terminates the reverbium project and despite Sajani's protests, dissolves the remaining reverbium using Antarctic Vibranium (that can instantly melt any metallic object) because it was a dangerous weapon, something that will never be part of Horizon. Peter then calls the Black Cat and tells her that he wants to get the reverbium back and she gladly accepts and while she goes to find out more about the Hobgoblin, Peter will use his resources within Horizon to design himself a new costume. At the Daily Bugle, Ben Urich is intrigued to see his nephew nicely dressed and happy about his new job. Phil then shows Norah footage of the Hobgoblin's attack on Horizon as they may help her Goblin file and although it makes Norah happy, she celebrates with her boyfriend Randy, annoying Phil who vows that \"the Hobgoblin is upping his game!\".</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1622607\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.70128676470588\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1622607\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man with new suit goes with the Black Cat to fight Hobgoblin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg 1088w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man with new suit goes with the Black Cat to fight Hobgoblin\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg 1088w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/1622607-spidey___black_cat_24.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man with new suit goes with the Black Cat to fight Hobgoblin</figcaption></figure><p>Peter is putting the finishing touches on his new costume when his girlfriend Carlie Cooper and his ex Mary Jane Watson visit him in his lab. Black Cat then calls Peter and tells him that she has found a lead on the Hobgoblin. Spider-Man dons his new black &amp; green costume and goes to meet-up with Felicia. The costume is made of light and sound bending technology that allows Peter to become invisible and inaudible, impressing the Cat by sneaking up on her and he gives her a pair of specialized goggles that allow her to hear and see him. It also makes him impervious to sonic attacks and they go together to take down the Hobgoblin who they know is working for the Kingpin thanks to the Cat having persuaded a snitch. However, the snitch was instructed by the Hobgoblin to tells the Cat about him and he reveals that he has sold out the Kingpin right before killing the snitch with a razor bat.</p><p>Now knowing of the duo's coming, Hobgoblin goes to Fisk Towers and warns Kingpin and Montana of the heroes. Black Cat cuts off the building's communications and she and Spider-Man infiltrate it. Fisk sends the Hobgoblin and a group of his Hand ninjas after them while he and Montana escape to the safety of Fisk's penthouse. Spider-Man easily defeats some ninjas and makes his way to the reverbium lab where the Hobgoblin and some ninjas confront him. As the alarm goes off, and realizing that the whole lab will be full of guards, the Black Cat decides to go to Fisk's penthouse, leaving Spidey alone to fight the Hobgoblin. Spider-Man, thanks to his stealth suit, gains the advantage and defeats the ninjas but an irritated Hobgoblin uses his Goblin Laugh to a much higher degree that dissolves the ninjas, disables Peter's suit's stealth ability and breaks his communication feeds with the Black Cat. However, the suit contains a secondary mode that still protects him from the Goblin's laugh but it also prevents him from hearing any other noise.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Cat has infiltrated Fisk's penthouse and started stealing some of Fisk's artifacts until Montana and Fisk notice her presence and attack her. She is no match to the combined might of both villains and cries for Spider-Man's help but because of his suit's secondary mode, he is unable to hear her. Spider-Man uses a spider-tracer made of Antarctic Vibranium to melt Hobgoblin's plasma sword so the villain uses his laugh again, causing a feedback wave from the reverbium that destroys the whole building. The Hobgoblin leaves and Spider-Man switches off his sonic shield and he can now hear the Cat's cries for help. He quickly goes to the penthouse and saves an injured Black Cat from the clutches of the Kingpin. As the floor crumbles, Hobgoblin saves the Kingpin but leaves Montana, whom he despises, to fall to his apparent death.</p><p>In the aftermath of the fight, the Black Cat tells Peter that her bad luck powers may have saved the day. Spider-Man is unimpressed by the Cat but is still relieved that the reverbium is no longer in Fisk's hands and considers the whole encounter as a win. The Kingpin relocates his criminal empire to Shadowland and hires the Hobgoblin to work for him. Phil has no other choice because he needs to repair his weapons thanks to the Tinkerer and is forced to continue selling footage of his alter-ego to the Daily Bugle. But despite this, he still considers himself to have hit the Big Time since he is keeping Norah, his uncle Ben and Robbie Robertson happy. With so much responsibilities, he has everything he ever wished for: power.</p><p>Peter has also hit the Big Time as his boss is impressed with his sound bending technology which he intends on incorporating into sound-proof headphones. He also has a new apartment and goes to celebrate with his girlfriend Carlie and proud Aunt May and Jay.</p><p>It should be noted that throughout this story, a resemblance between Peter and Phil is clearly shown. They both have an uncle named Ben, they both sell images of their alter-egos in action to the Daily Bugle and they both acknowledge a power and responsibility lesson, each in their own unique way. They have both grown up and they are taking risks, using their talents and impressing their mentors. Both are aware that that their powers and responsibilities are linked.</p><h2>Revenge of the Spider-Slayer</h2><p>Alistair Smythe has invaded the Raft prison and gave a dying Mac Gargan a new life saving Scorpion suit. It is revealed that during his past years as the Scorpion, Gargan's body has become reliant on the suit to survive and when he bonded with the symbiote, it replaced the suit as a life supporter. Smythe performed life saving bio-mechanical upgrades on Gargan and has him return to his identity as the Scorpion to take revenge on their mutual enemy J.Jonah Jameson. Scorpion has also been fitted with a \"Scorpion Sense\" which is exactly like Spider-Man's Spider-Sense.</p><p>J. Jonah Jameson meets up with his son John at a launch site where John will pilot a space craft that will intercept with a Horizon Labs space station and Max Modell is at the launch site to assist. Jonah fears for his son's safety because the spacecraft's engines are experimental but Modell offers to bring in his \"new top man\" Peter Parker to check on the engines.</p><p>Mary Jane notices that Peter's relationship with Carlie is getting serious and asks him if he will reveal his identity to her but he tells her that for now he prefers to keep his dual identity a secret because he wants Carlie to know the real him but MJ tells him that Spider-Man is the real him. He then receives a message from Jay Sr. telling him that Jonah needs him in John's launch site. After taking a skating lesson from his girlfriend Carlie and demonstrating clumsiness to hide his super-agility, Peter goes to the launch site where his Spider-Sense goes off at a very high degree. Feeling that there is danger everywhere, Peter tells Max to stall the launch because something is wrong and runs off. Indeed, Scorpion and Smythe are there to exact their revenge on Jonah who they plan on keeping alive but they intend to kill his son John.</p><p>Smythe and his Insect Army which is composed of \"Jumping Spiders\" (mechanical Spider-Slayers that take over human forms) infiltrate Ground Control and as John prepares to launch, Smythe locks down the controls and rigs the craft's rocket boosters to explode before the space craft leaves the atmosphere. Smythe's Insect Army then attack Jonah and his security detail until Spider-Man appears and fights them off. Jonah tells Spider-Man to stop and save his son. Spider-Man, forced to choose between the lives of Jonah and the others, and his John, reluctantly agrees and shoots a webline to the rocket as soon as it departed. While holding on to the space craft, Spider-Man is confronted by the evolved Scorpion who attacks him.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1514598-12_asm654_cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1514598\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1514598-12_asm654_cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1514598\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man fights the new Scorpion\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1514598-12_asm654_cov.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1514598-12_asm654_cov.jpg 900w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1514598-12_asm654_cov.jpg 632w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man fights the new Scorpion\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1514598-12_asm654_cov.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1514598-12_asm654_cov.jpg 900w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1514598-12_asm654_cov.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man fights the new Scorpion</figcaption></figure><p>While struggling to both hold on to the ship and dodging Scorpion's attacks, Spider-Man, using a com-link inside his mask, calls the Avengers for help but only Squirrel Girl answers since the Avengers are on a mission and she is the only one in the mansion babysitting Daniel Cage. Meanwhile, Doctor Octopus is monitoring the fight using a mini Octo-bot and expresses his disliking of Alistair. If the space craft doesn't intercept with the Horizon Labs space station, Ock's plan which he calls \"the Octathedral\" will be ruined so he uses his Octo-bot to reboot the Craft's control system, rendering them functional again and giving John control over his ship and he separates the boosters from each other one of them, which has Scorpion on it, explodes and Spider-Man fall off as the ship flies off into the atmosphere. As they are falling, Scorpion who survived the explosion thanks to his new armor, catches up Spider-Man and tells him that his armor will allow him to survive the fall but Spider-Man won't be so lucky. However, Ms Marvel arrives just in time, knocks Scorpion away and saves Spider-Man by catching him. She tell him that Squirrel Girl tracked his location using the comm link and transferred the coordinates to the other Avengers who appear and fight off the rest of the Insect Army. Scorpion survives his fall and after feeling nothing but the urge to do it all over again, believing that with his new upgrades, he is able to defeat the now deceased Sentry. He tells Smythe of the New Avengers's arrival and after realizing that John is safe, Smythe sends his Insect Army after Jonah's other loved ones: Marla Jameson who is with Aunt May at a Day Spa and Robbie Robertson.</p><p>Jonah protests that he wants the real Avengers to protect his friends and family, not the New Avengers, reminding Peter that his Aunt is with Marla at the Day Spa so he decides to go there using the Avengers Quinjet piloted by the Thing and Mockingbird. While Luke Cage and Iron Fist fight the bugs that are attacking Jonah, Peter tells Ms Marvel and Jewel to help while he goes with Thing and Mockingbird to the spa.</p><p>At the Bugle, Randy Robertson is annoyed by Phil Urich's advances on his girlfriend Norah when all of a sudden, the Insect Army crash in.</p><p>At the Spa, while fighting the Insect Army, Spider-Man realizes that Smythe has granted them a precognition ability much like his \"Spider-Sense\" that make them hard to hit. After making the Thing promise to keep May and Marla safe, Peter goes to Horizon Labs to come up with a device that will block the Insects' precognitive abilities. However, at Horizon Labs, after changing into civilian clothes, Peter is confronted by Max Modell who asks him about his relationship with Spider-Man since he disappears each time Spider-Man appears. Max assumes that Peter is hired by Spider-Man to build him weaponry and technology since he doesn't not believe that one man can possess both amazing Spider powers and scientific expertise.Peter, relieved that Max did not uncover his identity, tells his boss that he has been working with Spider-Man for a long time and now he can finally confide in someone. Peter tells Max that Spider-Man has asked him to build a device that blocks the Spider-Slayers' \"animal-instinct senses\". Max helps him in building the device but warns him that Spider-Man's enhanced senses will also be affected if he is included in the blast radius.</p><p>Meanwhile, John has successfully arrived at the Horizon Labs space station but is unable to return to Earth and help the others. Spider-Man goes to the spa where Thing and Mockingbird a trying to fend off the bots. Marla Jameson, using the materials from a fallen Mandroid that was sent to protect her, blocks off the slayers' power source, incapacitating them and giving the heroes the chance to take them down. At the bugle, while Norah is escaping, Randy is staying to help his father but Phil, in an attempt to kill him, causes the ceiling to collapse on top of him before joining Norah in her escape and thinks to himself in case Randy survived, he'll have to try to kill him again as the Hobgoblin. Randy survived and Robbie realized that the bots are after him and in an attempt to save the building, Ms Marvel and Jewel fly him away and the Insect Army goes after them.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1664778\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.97072784810127\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1664778\"><img alt=\"Spidey is affected by his own device\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg 1264w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey is affected by his own device\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg 1264w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62058/1664778-tasm_654023.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey is affected by his own device</figcaption></figure><p>While making his way to the spa, Spider-Man places the Spider-Sense jamming device on a building that is equidistant to all the location that contain Smythe's bots so that the blast could block off their senses and makes sure to get out of the blast radius so that his Spider-Sense would not be affected as well.

Anya is enraged by her father's death and vows to kill the Red Hultk but Reed tells her to help the near-by civilians. The Red Hulk then goes after Spider-Girl and after a brief fight, she leads him to the river where his head clears and blames everything on someone called Raven. Anya then goes back to City College to see her father's body taken away and she feels that the Spider-Girl part of her is dead. Days later, she attends her father's funeral with her friends Nikki Barnes (Nomad) and Rocky Flint. She then vents her frustration on a rooftop, thinking that no one knows how she feels and that the city is closing in on her. At home, Rocky Flint visits her and tells her that she knows how she feels because her mother died during one of Green Goblin's rampages and she tells her that she's there to support her. However, unknown to Anya, a mysterious man is watching her via hidden cameras.</p><p>In the aftermath of her fathers funeral Anya struggles with his death. He was the one person who knew her as Anya and as Spider-Girl, but as Anya first. She decides that she has to tell someone close to her about her dual life. She considers her friend Rocky but decides against it at the last moment. Anya eventually decides to tell Sue Storm her secret. Sue reveals that she already knew as Anya's father told her years earlier. She also says that Reed has set-up a scholarship for her so that she can be secure in her future.</p><p>While out on patrol she is again confronted by the Red Hulk who has figured out who she is. He explains to her that he and her father were poisoned by a group called the Ravens. Ross believes that they are also behind the death of one of his friends. The poison caused him to change from Ross into the Red Hulk and lose control, but it was going to kill her father. The fact that he caused the building to collapse made no difference, he was already dead. Spider-Girl can't forgive him completely but she does say that she'll help him find and take down the Ravens.</p><h3>Hunters and Spiders</h3><p>The second part of this arc opens with <a href=\"/ana-kravinoff/4005-61343/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61343\">Ana Kravinoff</a> sparring with her father <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven</a>.

He tells her she has to take up the hunt again against the spiders, and that her first target is Spider-Girl. Meanwhile Anya continues fighting crime as Spider-Girl, updating her exploits on her twitter feed The_Spider_Girl. Ana uses this to track her.

Spider-Girl eventually defeats Screwball, but when she is looking back over the footage she notices Ana stalking her in the background. She then lures the young hunter into a trap, and the two square off on the rooftops above the city.</p><p>At first the fight goes well for Spider-Girl and she gains the upper hand on the Ana, until the hunter reveals she was just gauging her opponents strengths so she could exploit her weaknesses. The tide of the fight quickly turns and Spider-Girl realizes that she can't compete with Kravinoff in hand to hand combat. She decides instead to use the setting of the fight to her advantage. Her knowledge of New York gives her to edge as she leads Ana towards the Baxter Building. The security systems recognize Ana as a threat and start counter measures against her, she barely manages to evade them and chooses to retreat and come back at Anya another day. However Spider-Girl catches up to her and manages to tie her up with the oncoming traffic which drags her down to the street, knocking her out.</p><p>Meanwhile at a Raven Society Outpost we see the beginning of a plan to recruit Spider-Girl to become a agent of the Raven. Kurt Godwin says he knows her secret identity and is gonna use her 'daddy issues' against her.</p><p>Footage of the fight between Ana Kravinoff and Spider-Girl is being shown on the news.

The authorities fear that Osborn might walk away free using a plea of insanity so to insure that the trial is executed carefully and without mistakes they keep Norman without charges and they transfer him to a privately operated facility called the <a href=\"/special-containment-center/4020-57162/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57162\">Special Containment Center (SCC)</a> that holds the world's most dangerous villains: <a href=\"/kingmaker/4005-41990/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41990\">Kingmaker</a>, <a href=\"/xirdal/4005-74630/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74630\">Xirdal</a>, Carl \"Carny\" Rives, <a href=\"/june-covington/4005-74558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74558\">June Covington the Toxic Doxie</a>, and <a href=\"/the-decapitator/4005-74554/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74554\">Ai Apaec the Decapitator</a>.

Norman is placed in the facility's Third Wing where Coulmier, in a fake private therapy session, tells Norman about the growing Goblin Cult as he believes that Norman has a crucial in bringing about a better world and offers to break him out of the facility to lead their cult. Although Norman is intrigued by the proposition, he refuses because as a political prisoner, escaping would hurt his cause. As Coulmier continues to try and convince Norman to escape with him, an alarm goes off and Norman uses this opportunity to kill two guards and begin his escape. With the alarm still going off, Ai Apaec kills a guard and Norman confront him and the other inmates and tells them that he will free them all as long as they follow his orders until they are free and threatens that he will kill them all if they don't. However, one of the inmates, Xirdal, refuses to follow a murderer and goes on her own path, and she is seemingly killed by flooding waters after she opened a hatch. Osborn thinks that she made a poor choice and continues on his path with Coulmier and the other inmates.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Front Line offices, <a href=\"/norah-winters/4005-58731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58731\">Norah Winters</a>, after following the advice of Peter Parker, starts working on her paper concerning Norman Osborn since he's in jail but when one of her informants tell her that Norman has been removed from the Raft, she becomes afraid for her life, thinking that Norman will kill her if she publishes her paper so she decides to find his wherabouts. She recieves a mysterious envelope from her informant telling her to meet him at Pier 84. There, he directs Norah to a submarine, taking her to the SCC.</p><p>Osborn and the remaining inmates of the Third Wing enter into the the main area of the prison, where a riot between the other prisoners is taking place. Here he quickly takes control of the rioters by targeting and taking out the strongest threat he can find. The rioters realize who he is and begin to chant his name while showing their <a href=\"/goblin-tattoo/4055-56590/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56590\">Goblin tattoos</a>. This is all observed by Norah Winters who has made her way to a guard post above the riot. Norman notices that someone is in the guard post and sends Ai Apaec to investigate. Upon seeing that it is Norah, he smiles and tells her that she is just in time to see him raise an army.</p><p>As that is going on Sarah Saulsby, another reporter from the Daily Bugle is trying to track down Norah. She rings the police and says that she hasn't been able to contact her, and that she thinks it has something to with Norman Osborn and a meeting point on Pier 84. She says she has to get the message to Senator Sondra Muffoletto, who was mentioned in Norah notes. Once Sondra hears mention of Pier 84 she contacts Senator Morrison who denies any knowledge of anything to do with Osborn. Sondra realizes she is being set up to take the fall if the truth about Osborn comes out.</p><h2>Venom Pre-crisis</h2><p><a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Flash Thompson</a> is the new <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a>. As Flash gets ready for the procedure, the General tells, Corporal Flash Thompson, that he can back out if he wants. Flash declines that offer and wants to serve his country once again. The General agrees and makes sure that Flash knows about the pain and discomfort that he might feel when injected with the Venom Symbiote. Flash tells the General that he has felt far more worse pain before, however wonders why the General picked him? Flash notices that he is missing his legs since the war, but the General replies that he can look past disadvantages. The General goes on about all of the good that Flash has brought to his country and his friends in the special forces and also mentions about his dog liking him also.</p><p>With that, The General tells Doctor Mackenzie to start what is called in the story \"Project Rebirth 2.0.\" While Flash is all-for-one for the Venom Symbiote, he does have a problem with the name. Flash states that he is a fan of <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Steve Rogers</a> (the first Captain America), but he rather have a more Spider-Man themed named. Since Flash is one of Spider-Man's biggest fans! The Doctor explained that this project was like the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\">super soldier serum</a> and also another chance at fighting for America for Flash. As Mackenzie continued, he stated that Flash had already been pumped full of a drug that would allow him to control the Symbiote and wouldn't let the Symbiote gain control, as the process was a success, Flash did feel a little pain.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1666061-tasm_654036.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1666061\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.528125\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1666061-tasm_654036.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1666061\"><img alt=\"\"I'm Spider-Man!\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" data-width=\"628\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1666061-tasm_654036.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1666061-tasm_654036.jpg 1280w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/1666061-tasm_654036.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1666061-tasm_654036.jpg 628w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"I'm Spider-Man!\"</figcaption></figure><p>After the suit had cover his entire body and Flash had made the suit grow him legs, Flash was off for training to be like Spider-Man. Succeeding in being in control of the Venom suit, he stated that \"I am Spider-Man!\", however he was corrected by Mackenzie that he is \"Venom\". Flash wondered \"why he couldn't be Spider-Man?\", and Mackenzie answered his question with using the example of Venom. Venom would eat someone, spit them out, and kill them over-and-over, Spider-Man doesn't kill, but Venom does. What the Special Forces are trying to do is to strike fear into the hearts of terrorist against America.</p><p>When Mackenzie got to the \"killing\" part of things, he gave Flash a bunch of new weapons. Mackenzie gave him a gun that is an omni-firearm, which would allow Flash to switch to any gun at any given moment to kill someone from close range or long range. He was also given a truth serum, chemicals and other types of technology/weaponry that he might need in the field. All of this would be held in the Symbiote suit, and also a knife for unarmed combat. Mackenzie also told him to never forget that the Symbiote suit is his most powerful weapon. While Flash was amazed at what he got, he wondered if he would ever need his Spider-Senses?</p><p><a href=\"/katherine-glover/4005-76018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76018\">Katherine Glover</a>, part of the US Army Special Forces, told Flash that he won't need that. Katherine Glover introduced herself to him and told Flash that she will deploy him on his Venom missions. Katherine also tells Flash that if she sees any sign that the alien is taking over, she will flip a switch and will kill the suit. Leaving Flash to be alone without any legs to stand upon, literally. Hours later, Flash was seen finishing off some soldiers just for non-lethal combat training. When he passed with flying colors, he came back inside to see the General's dog growling at him. Wondering why the dog hated him now, he realized that it was the suit the dog didn't like.

Mackenzie and Flash left to visit a science exhibition, while they left Captain Katherine and General Dodge to talk with one another. Katherine reminded the General that they should tell Flash that he is the second serviceman to wear the suit, and the first one's brain was fried (thanks to Katherine). However only wanting a weapon, General told Katherine to keep it a secret until Flash looses control or he finishes all of his missions. The General stated that Flash is a true soldier to the very end, and will protect his country at whatever costs.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/amazing-spider-man-big-time-amazing-spider-man-big-time/4000-263342/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-263342\">Amazing Spider-Man: Big Time</a></li><li><a href=\"/amazing-spider-man-matters-of-life-and-death-amazing-spider-man-matters-of-life-and-death/4000-274799/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-274799\">Amazing Spider-Man: Matters of Life and Death</a></li><li><a href=\"/amazing-spider-man-the-fantastic-spider-man-amazing-spider-man-the-fantastic-spider-man/4000-291033/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-291033\">Amazing Spider-Man: The Fantastic Spider-Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/amazing-spider-man-big-time-ultimate-collection/4050-49825/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-49825\">Amazing Spider-Man: Big Time Ultimate Collection</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-point-one-marvel-point-one/4000-284853/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-284853\">Marvel Point One</a></li><li><a href=\"/osborn-evil-incarcerated-osborn-evil-incarcerated/4000-277204/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-277204\">Osborn: Evil Incarcerated</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-girl-family-values-spider-girl-family-values/4000-293491/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293491\">Spider-Girl: Family Values</a></li><li><a href=\"/venom-by-rick-remender-volume-one/4000-293645/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293645\">Venom by Rick Remender</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-astonishing-spider-man-61/4000-334153/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-334153\">Astonishing Spider-Man #61</a> (UK)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-astonishing-spider-man-62/4000-420579/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-420579\">Astonishing Spider-Man #62</a> (UK)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-astonishing-spider-man-63/4000-420578/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-420578\">Astonishing Spider-Man #63</a> (UK)</li><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-335384/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-335384\">Astonishing Spider-Man #64</a> (UK)</li><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-339666/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-339666\">Astonishing Spider-Man #65</a> (UK)</li><li><a href=\"/chelovek-pauk-mega-komiks-/4000-386277/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-386277\">Chelovek-Pauk.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p><a href=\"/flashpoint/4050-39997/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-39997\">Flashpoint</a> is an event focusing on Barry Allen and the rest of the Flash Family's efforts to fix the fissures in time, made by unknown forces. It was first mentioned in the sixth issue of <a href=\"/geoff-johns/4040-40439/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40439\">Geoff Johns'</a> <a href=\"/the-flash/4050-32562/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32562\">The Flash</a>, and will later be seen in a five issue mini series written by Johns and drawn by <a href=\"/andy-kubert/4040-8472/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-8472\">Andy Kubert</a> starting in May 2011. As with <a href=\"/blackest-night/4045-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\">Blackest Night,</a> Flashpoint is accompanied by a fifteen three-issue mini series, as well as a number of one shots, starring characters like <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href=\"/aquaman/4005-2357/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\">Aquaman</a>, and more, showing how the event affects their lives.</p><p>The events here lead to <a href=\"/the-new-52/4015-56061/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56061\">The New 52</a>.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>Prelude: Road to Flashpoint</h3><p>After Barry Allen proves his innocence in the murder of the <a href=\"/mirror-monarch/4005-70541/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70541\">Mirror Monarch</a>, the 25th century Court of Temporal Justice discover that there are a series of fissures within the time, creating numerous paradoxes within the past, present and future, all stemming from the 21st century. Unsure of what they would potentially warn Allen of, the Court fails to inform Allen of the fissures in time.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the 21st century, <a href=\"/captain-boomerang/4005-7650/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7650\">Captain Boomerang</a> manages to help free <a href=\"/professor-zoom/4005-18340/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18340\">Reverse Flash</a> from his imprisonment. With the Reverse Flash free, and rampaging through time, changing his own origins, a new speedster by the name of <a href=\"/hot-pursuit/4005-74605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74605\">Hot Pursuit</a> rushes to find Allen in order to warn him of the Flashpoint.</p><h3>Flashpoint</h3><p><a href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Barry Allen</a> wakes up to discover he is in an altered timeline in which <a href=\"/captain-cold/4005-2392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2392\">Citizen Cold</a> is <a href=\"/central-city/4020-54995/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54995\">Central City</a>'s greatest hero, his mother Nora (deceased in his own timeline) is alive, his father, Henry, died of a heart attack three years ago (instead of in prison), and that the Flash, the <a href=\"/justice-league/4060-55928/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55928\">Justice League</a> and <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> do not exist.</p><p>In <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a>, <a href=\"/thomas-wayne/4005-3602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3602\">Batman</a> throws a criminal off a building before being confronted by <a href=\"/cyborg/4005-2388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2388\">Cyborg</a>. Cyborg and Batman have a conference with a group of superheroes to discuss how the battle between <a href=\"/aquaman/4005-2357/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\">Aquaman's</a> Atlanteans and <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a>'s Amazons has caused massive death and destruction in Western Europe (sunken by the Atlanteans, except for the United Kingdom, which was conquered by the Amazons), with the prospect of America being similarly endangered. The heroes cannot work together to find a solution, and the meeting is disbanded. Barry Allen drives to the Batcave where he is attacked by Batman who is revealed to be Thomas Wayne - Bruce having died in his place in this timeline.</p><p>In the flooded remains of Paris, <a href=\"/deathstroke-the-terminator/4050-9645/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9645\">Deathstroke the Terminator</a> captains a pirate ship in search of his daughter. He along with his crew (Sonar, Icicle, and Clayface) are attacked by Emperor Aquaman, who stabs Deathstroke in the chest. Sonar is able to remove a piece of the trident from Deathstroke's chest and heal him. Back at Wayne Manor, Barry tries to explain to Thomas about his secret identity as the Flash and his relationship to Bruce Wayne. Barry's memory begins to spontaneously realign itself to the altered timeline and Barry learns that the world of Flashpoint is not an alternate dimension, but his own. Barry's ring ejects the <a href=\"/professor-zoom/4005-18340/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18340\">Reverse-Flash</a>'s costume and causes Barry to believe that the Reverse-Flash is responsible for changing history. Barry decides to recreate the accident that gave him his powers in a bid to undo the damage caused by the Reverse-Flash, but the initial attempt causes him to be badly burnt.</p><p>In London, <a href=\"/steve-trevor/4005-15789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15789\">Steve Trevor</a> is waiting at a rendezvous point for <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a> but is attacked by Wonder Woman and the Amazons. Wonder Woman catches him by the neck with her Lasso of Truth and begins interrogating him. He explains that he was hired to extract Lois Lane from New Themyscira because she was sent to gather information on the Amazons for Cyborg. The U.S. president informs Cyborg that Steve Trevor sent a signal to the Resistance but was intercepted because of a traitor among the heroes that Cyborg tried to recruit. Cyborg is relieved of duty as Element Woman sneaks into the headquarters. Meanwhile in New Themyscira, Lois Lane encounters the Resistance. A second lightning strike grants Barry Allen his powers, healing his injuries, allowing him to recreate his costume. Barry's research of past records of newspaper clippings leads him to conclude that the Reverse-Flash deliberately changed the timeline to prevent the formation of the Justice League. He also learns of a rocket carrying the infant Kal-El, that crashed into Metropolis instead of Kansas. Kal-El was taken by Project: Superman, and named Subject 1. Flash and Batman meet with Cyborg and agree to join the cause to stop Wonder Woman and Aquaman, and the three go in search of 'Subject 1'. In the project headquarters they discover a pale, weakened version of Superman. Their meeting is interrupted by the arrival of guards and Superman flies off in the midst of battle, leaving the Flash, Batman, and Cyborg in the sewers to be rescued by Element Woman. Flash's memories begin to change much more drastically. In order to prevent him forgetting the original timeline completely, Batman gives him an anti-epileptic to slow down his brain's electrical activity.</p><p>The president announces Cyborg's failure to unite the world's super heroes and the U.S. entry into the Atlantean/Amazon war. In Fawcett City, Billy Batson feels distressed about trying to intervene after being easily defeated by Wonder Woman, before resolving to put a stop to the war. The Flash, Batman, Cyborg, and Element Woman break down the door in need of the Marvel Family's help, and Batman asks Billy to use his lighting to prevent Flash's memories from changing even further. Billy sees the memories of his DC timeline counterpart. The group hears of the failed air assault on England due to the Amazons' Invisible Plane airforce. Hal Jordan is the first casualty, and a giant Atlantean-generated tidal wave threatens the rest of New Themyscira. Flash tells Batman that he cannot just stand by as people die since if he fails to stop the Reverse-Flash, the world will destroy itself. Despite some reservations, Batman joins Flash as the group heads off to New Themyscira where they are joined en route by Enchantress. Wonder Woman and Aquaman are fighting one-on-one until Flash and his team arrive. The Marvel Family transform into Captain Thunder, also transforming Tawney. Captain Thunder attacks Wonder Woman and appears to be winning until Enchantress reveals herself as the Amazon spy and uses her magic to restore the Marvel Family to their mortal forms. Penthesileia kills Billy Batson, causing a massive explosion that cripples the opposing forces. In the wake of the devastation, the Reverse-Flash appears in front of the Flash.</p><p>Thawne reveals to Barry that the Flashpoint timeline was actually created by Barry himself after he travelled back in time to stop Thawne from killing his mother. Barry pulled the entire Speed Force into himself to stop Zoom, transforming the timeline. Zoom resets Barry's internal vibrations, enabling him to remember this. According to Zoom, these actions transformed him into a living paradox, no longer requiring Barry to exist and allowing him to kill the Flash without erasing his own existence. Zoom continues to taunt Barry with this knowledge until he is stabbed in the back by an Amazonian sword and killed by Batman. As the fight continues, Subject 1 arrives and begins to aid the heroes, but Thomas still insists that Barry put history back to normal to undo the millions of deaths that have resulted from the Amazon/Atlantean war. Meanwhile Cyborg detects seismic activity which he claims could destroy the world and waves start to approach. Now knowing the point of divergence, the Flash resumes his attempts to restore the timeline. Before he enters the timestream, Thomas thanks him for giving his son a second chance and gives Barry a letter addressed to Bruce. Barry then meets his mother and reveals his secrets and his inadvertent role in creating the Flashpoint universe by saving her life. Barry bids a tearful farewell to her and Nora Allen also accepts her fate, acknowledging that she will be reunited with her husband in the afterlife when Barry succeeds. Traveling back in time, Barry merges with his younger counterpart during the attempt to stop Thawne. In the timestream, Barry realizes he can see three different timelines -- <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC</a>, <a href=\"/vertigo/4010-521/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-521\">Vertigo</a>, and <a href=\"/wildstorm/4010-708/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-708\">WildStorm</a>. A mysterious hooded figure tells him that the world was split into three to weaken them for an impending threat, and must now be reunited to combat it. The DC, Vertigo, and WildStorm universes merge, creating the new DC universe. Barry then wakes up in a similar manner to the beginning of Flashpoint. Believing that everything is over, Barry remembers Thomas' letter and gives it to Bruce, who is still the Batman in this timeline. Bruce is deeply touched by his father's sacrifice to ensure his own life, and is grateful to Barry for informing him of the events that transpired before the timeline was reset.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/flashpoint/4050-39997/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-39997\">Flashpoint</a></li><li><a href=\"/flashpoint-the-world-of-flashpoint-featuring-batman/4050-46596/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-46596\">Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint Featuring Batman</a></li><li><a href=\"/flashpoint-the-world-of-flashpoint-featuring-the-flash/4050-46931/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-46931\">Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint Featuring The Flash</a></li><li><a href=\"/flashpoint-the-world-of-flashpoint-featuring-green-lantern/4050-46930/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-46930\">Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint Featuring Green Lantern</a></li><li><a href=\"/flashpoint-the-world-of-flashpoint-featuring-superman/4050-46597/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-46597\">Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint Featuring Superman</a></li><li><a href=\"/flashpoint-the-world-of-flashpoint-featuring-wonder-woman/4050-46598/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-46598\">Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint Featuring Wonder Woman</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/flashpoint-monster-edition/4050-65035/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-65035\">Flashpoint Monster Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/flashpoint-sonderband-aquaman-vs-wonder-woman/4050-65039/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-65039\">Flashpoint Sonderband: Aquaman vs. Wonder Woman</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/flashpoint-sonderband-batman/4050-65036/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-65036\">Flashpoint Sonderband: Batman</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/flashpoint-sonderband-green-lantern/4050-65037/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-65037\">Flashpoint Sonderband: Green Lantern</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/flashpoint-sonderband-superman/4050-65038/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-65038\">Flashpoint Sonderband: Superman</a></li></ul>",

It is often compared to the largely popular <a href=\"/age-of-apocalypse/4045-40752/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40752\">Age of Apocalypse</a> in that the current day reality has been warped due to an event in mainstream continuity. In the Age of X, the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> do not exist as mutants were never educated in <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier's School For The Gifted</a> to fight to protect a world that hates and fears them. Without a group of mutants fighting for acceptance, characters have therefore developed differently. Yet events that have happened strike a parallel to that of normal continuity, such as the destruction of Albany, New York at the hands of <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Phoenix</a> instead of the galaxy that was destroyed in the <a href=\"/dark-phoenix-saga/4045-42183/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42183\">Dark Phoenix Saga</a>. Also, instead of uniting all the world's mutants on the island of <a href=\"/utopia/4020-56536/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56536\">Utopia</a>, they have barricaded themselves inside <a href=\"/fortress-x/4020-57174/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57174\">Fortress X</a>.</p><p>It was decided that the Age of X would be a cross-over between X-Men: Legacy and the New Mutants for a three-month period. The story runs in a linear fashion, but slowly drops hints that point to what happened in the past. The promotional material features familiar characters with unfamiliar codenames and drastically different looks. A great example of which is <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> who is known as Basilisk (a mythological creature who killed it's prey with it's stare) and wears a faceplate covering the upper half of his face instead of his trademark mono-lens visor.</p><h2>Related Issues</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59038/1594698-age_of_x_avengers_tasked_with_hunting_mutants.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1594698\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.65916398713826\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59038/1594698-age_of_x_avengers_tasked_with_hunting_mutants.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1594698\"><img alt=\"Avengers In The Age Of X\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/59038/1594698-age_of_x_avengers_tasked_with_hunting_mutants.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59038/1594698-age_of_x_avengers_tasked_with_hunting_mutants.jpg 933w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/59038/1594698-age_of_x_avengers_tasked_with_hunting_mutants.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Avengers In The Age Of X</figcaption></figure><p>Unexpectedly, the first signs of the Age of X appeared at the end of <a href=\"/x-men-legacy-none-so-blind/4000-258326/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-258326\">X-Men: Legacy #244</a> yet the story didn't officially commence until January 2011 with a one-shot issue called <a href=\"/forums/comic-book-preview/1988/first-look-age-of-x-alpha/590633/#21\">Age of X: Alpha</a>.

Here are a few of the unusual words that are exclusive to this storyline.</p><h3>Worm</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1615706-1294781469.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1615706\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.48111111111111\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1615706-1294781469.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1615706\"><img alt=\"Requesting A 'Worm'\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1615706-1294781469.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1615706-1294781469.jpg 900w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1615706-1294781469.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Requesting A 'Worm'\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1615706-1294781469.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1615706-1294781469.jpg 900w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1615706-1294781469.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Requesting A 'Worm'</figcaption></figure><p>A Worm or Comms Worm is a method of communication that the mutants use when out on the battlefield.

However, upon the revelation of X's true identity as it was connected to her powers of reality manipulation.</p><h3>Force Walls</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1790546\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.378\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:37.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1790546\"><img alt=\"The First Force Wall\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg 2000w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The First Force Wall\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg 2000w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1790546-aofunivers2012.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The First Force Wall</figcaption></figure><p>There are two types of force Wall; technological and psionic. The humans can construct technological Force Walls as an energy barrier between walls, which can entrap mutants with physical based powers. Mutants with psionic telekinetic abilities such as the <a href=\"/force-warriors/4060-58160/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58160\">Force Warriors</a> can create a more organic form of Force Walls that prevents entrance to Fortress X and slows down human attacks.</p><p>The first Force Wall was inspired by the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman's</a> self-sacrifice, as her invisible force field temporarily halted the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk's</a> murderous rampage. Telekinetic mutants who witnessed her sacrifice were inspired and repeated the technique just in time to contain a nuclear blast</p><h3>Preak</h3><p>In mainstream continuity, a mutant is a 'Mutie' while a non-powered human could be referred to as 'Flatscan'. In this reality the mutants use the word 'Preak' (or 'Preaks' in the plural form) as an insulting derogatory term for the human forces instead of 'Flascan'. It is a colloquial abbreviated version of \"precursor\", meaning that the humans were what came before the mutants.</p><h2>Background History</h2><h3>Prelude</h3><p>During mainstream continuity, <a href=\"/blindfold/4005-40597/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40597\">Blindfold</a> had confided in <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a> that she'd had visions of an entity. A mysterious force wanted to change everything, and once it started it would not stop until everything had been destroyed. However, she couldn't identify whatever it was as it kept hiding around the peripheral of her visions. Rogue thought she'd solved the problem after she'd fought a squid-like spider-monster that had escaped from <a href=\"/emplate/4005-10579/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10579\">Emplate's</a> dimension. However, Blindfold was left reeling in horror as only she could see the looming shadow of Fortress X crashing into reality. The Age of X quickly took over.</p><h3>Anti-Mutant Politics</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1691819\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.26204238921002\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:26.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1691819\"><img alt=\"Protesters Surrounding Arrested Mutants\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg 2595w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Protesters Surrounding Arrested Mutants\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg 2595w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1691819-ageofx004.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Protesters Surrounding Arrested Mutants</figcaption></figure><p>History was different, with greater anti-mutant sentiments than that of mainstream continuity. The Human Coalition had been building anti-mutant support over the years. Various States had installed Department of Corrections. The major cities weren't effected at first, but the smaller towns and more dispersed populations were targeted early on. Exonims were sent to collect mutants and deliver them to the Gulags. Innocent people such as the <a href=\"/guthrie-family/4060-56004/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56004\">Guthrie family</a> were killed, but no-one was prosecuted as it was public knowledge that two mutants had been born into the family. Regular citizens went on \"Marches For Purity\". On one such occasion, the Marchers turned into an angry mob who savagely beat <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Dr Henry McCoy</a> to death. Yet the protesters weren't prosecuted.</p><p>The political climate was finally set in stone when the mutant known as the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix</a> raged out of control and destroyed the American town of Albany. Laws were passed, outlawing the <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">X-Gene</a>. It made it easier for the <a href=\"/sapien-league/4060-56090/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56090\">Sapien League</a> to win the election, which in turn created a precedent across the world. Laws were passed in most countries against mutants. Therefore mutants like <a href=\"/jonothon-starsmore/4005-2244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2244\">Chamber</a>, <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a> &amp; <a href=\"/pixie/4005-40673/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40673\">Pixie</a> were exiled on a small British island, and all emigrated to Canada which was still neutral. From there they dispersed around North America.</p><h3>Sentinels &amp; Incarceration</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1563403-1292451404.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1563403\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.66130760986066\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1563403-1292451404.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1563403\"><img alt=\"Operation: Red Hot\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1563403-1292451404.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1563403-1292451404.jpg 933w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1563403-1292451404.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Operation: Red Hot\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1563403-1292451404.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1563403-1292451404.jpg 933w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1563403-1292451404.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Operation: Red Hot</figcaption></figure><p>After that, the Exonims were given more freedom to kill on sight. Parents who had produced mutant children were expected to hand themselves over for sterilization. They were arrested if they didn't. A well as the Exonims, <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels</a> were sanctioned and dispatched.

With the human forces pushed back, Legacy is called to absorb Tempo's memories. Adjusting to the new flood of memories, Legacy strolls around the Fortress instead of returning inside. There she observes a mysterious figure lurking around the up-turned vehicles. The figure is swiftly dispatched by a Cadre, and Magneto arrives identifying her as Katherine Pryde. As he returns Pryde to the Brig, Legacy investigates what Pryde had dropped &amp; discovers a digital camera.</p><p>While the other mutants relax over games of cards &amp; drinks, Legacy pays <a href=\"/madison-jeffries/4005-24399/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24399\">Madison Jeffries</a> a visit. He had been studying the light from the stars which never seemed to change. Presented with Pryde's camera, Jeffries reveals that it contains hundreds of blank pictures. In exchange for a kiss, he lets Legacy borrow his powers. Using his ability to communicate with technology, Legacy sneaks into the Brig. As she passes through the corridors she encounters Blindfold who addresses her as \"Rogue\". Although Legacy sympathises for Blindfold who is clearly distressed, it wasn't Blindfold who she came to see. However, Pryde is reticent and doesn't reveal who it was that freed her &amp; provided her with a camera. Just as they were about to discuss what they knew, Danger's drones appeared. Borrowing Pryde's ability to phase, Legacy flees.</p><p>She unexpectedly runs into the cell containing Professor X, and begins to question how she recognises a man she's never met before.

Nemesis insisted that the culling of the personalities is like popping soap bubbles in the bath tub; that the water is still left in tact. However, the Professor showed Nemesis the psychic destruction in Legion's mind as many of the remaining personalities were left as rotting corpses. While inside Legion's mind, the Professor was attacked by a new personality. The giant monster that constantly reshaped the landscape inside Legion's mind. As an experienced telepath, the Professor over-confidently battled the monster. Yet it telepathically scanned his mind and therefore took on the form of a loved one; Moira MacTaggert. Seeing Moira gave the creature the upper-hand. It defeated Professor X and used it's power to reshape reality around them. Therefore Utopia was transformed into Fortress X, and all it's residents were given new memories of a different life.</p><p>With the truth unmasked, Moira appears and appeals to Legion not to listen to the Professor. However the pressure grows too much for him &amp; his cries out in agony. To stop the mutants from over-throwing her, Moira summons the human forces to attack the Fortress.

She tells Professor X that this is the second time that Legion has been responsible for distorting reality &amp; that there must be some sort of retribution.</p><h3>Aftermath</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1790572\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.114\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1790572\"><img alt=\"Repercussions\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px\" data-width=\"861\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg 1000w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg 861w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Repercussions\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg 1000w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1790572-nm24017.jpg 861w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px\" data-width=\"861\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Repercussions</figcaption></figure><p>Not all of the X-Men were restored to their former physical status. Before 'Moira' had warped reality, <a href=\"/jonothon-starsmore/4005-2244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2244\">Jonothon Starsmore</a> was a blue-skinned man with the markings of Apocalypse when the <a href=\"/clan-akkaba/4060-52719/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52719\">Clan Akkaba</a> had reconstructed his body. However, Legion's one &amp; only attempt to restore reality had missed Starsmore, leaving him without any physical traces of his chest &amp; lower jaw. Permanently restored with his mutant powers, he has remained as the X-Man known as Chamber. Although regaining more of his arms, Hellion retains the finer control over his telekinetic powers that he had during the Age Of X and the mechanical hands that he controls remotely with his powers.</p><p>Revanent whom everyone believed to be Phoenix (the being who was thought to have destroyed Albany) was in fact the psychic presence of <a href=\"/rachel-summers/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Rachel Summers</a>. She had sent her consciousness psychically across the universe when reality on Utopia had been warped. Therefore she was also warped into believing she was someone else.

Cannonball has them all removed, while Pixie retains select few memories from Nightmare's least sadistic moments. <a href=\"/frenzy/4005-2163/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2163\">Frenzy</a> was ready to submit to the telepathic surgery, but changes her mind at the last minute. She had lost Cyclops to Emma Frost, but chooses not to remove the memories of her sexual relationship with him. Instead she dwells on those memories of him &amp; when she was treated as a hero. After struggling with the reality that the Tempo Cadre no longer exists, she gives herself a make-over to resemble the woman she'd been in Fortress X, and declares that she wishes to be an X-Man. Although she fails to convince Cyclops that they should still be together, she tells him that she will wait.</p><p>Likewise, Gambit approaches Rogue about their relationship. He tells her that she needs to experience more of the world &amp; that he will wait for her no matter how long it takes. Meanwhile, Rogue has decided to honour the promise that Legacy made to hold on to the memories of the dead. She turns to Magneto for his advice. He takes her to the museum Auschwitz &amp; recounts the story of August Hirt, a war criminal he killed in the years following the war. The epilogue to his story is that he is a dangerous &amp; dark man, and that Rogue should go back to Gambit. Instead, that evening she goes to Magneto's room where they embrace &amp; kiss.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1828427-sdasd.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1828427\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5759162303665\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1828427-sdasd.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1828427\"><img alt=\"Legions Rebellious Personalities\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px\" data-width=\"609\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1828427-sdasd.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1828427-sdasd.png 764w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1828427-sdasd.png 609w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Legions Rebellious Personalities\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1828427-sdasd.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1828427-sdasd.png 764w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1828427-sdasd.png 609w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px\" data-width=\"609\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Legions Rebellious Personalities</figcaption></figure><p>Having seen the dire ramifications of their previous drastic treatment of Legion's personalities, Dr Rao &amp; Dr Nemesis come up with a more practical means for Legion to access the thousands of powers stored inside his mind. They present him with a wristband that can access a different personality for 60 seconds at a time. Legion is no longer reduced to the mentality of a young boy. Instead he can converse &amp; think as he did when he was a Force Warrior. With the wristband he retains control over his body, but has temporary access to a different power. However, when testing the new wristband they discover that some of the personalities aren't willing to co-operate. With Rogue's help siphoning through the different personalities in Legion's mind (much in the same way she used to when she couldn't control her own powers), they discover that six of the personalities remained in the physical world.</p><p>As such, a new team of X-Men is assembled. Rogue, Gambit, <a href=\"/frenzy/4005-2163/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2163\">Frenzy</a>, Magneto &amp; Professor X are sent to Europe to locate, disable &amp; aid Legion in re-absorbing the missing personalities before they do any more damage.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><p>A hard-cover collected edition was published in June 2011.

    "description": "<h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>Prelude: Book of the Skull</h3><p>In the Egyptian desert, <a href=\"/sin/4005-28057/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28057\">Sin </a>and <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\">Baron Zemo </a>seek out Sin's father's (<a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">The Red Skull</a>) hidden journal about his greatest failure. After entering the base and recovering the book, Sin relates the story to Zemo:</p><p>In 1942, The Red Skull came across a gypsy camp and learned of a secret language that could summon a weapon from the gods. With the aid of the Nazi occult Thule Society, the Skull exterminated several <a href=\"/atlanteans/4060-13407/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13407\">Atlantean </a>citizens as sacrifices for a ritual to summon this power. The process was seemingly successful, as a bolt of lightning landed in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/antarctica/4020-55940/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55940\">Antarctica</a>.</p><p>The next day, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky</a>, and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor </a>come across the now-abandoned German castle, and find the dead bodies of the Atlanteans. They track down the Red Skull, who is already at the site of the crash. But the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/invaders/4060-25865/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25865\">Invaders </a>are attacked by a large blue demon that was apparently brought to Earth along with the weapon, by accident.</p><p>The Invaders defeat the demon, though the Skull manages to make his escape. Back at the crash site, the Thule Society occultists begin invoking special spells to protect and hide the weapon that fell from the skies - an Asgardian hammer. The journal of the Red Skull tells of this hammer's secret location.</p><p>Back in the present day, the secret base begins to crumble as a booby trap left behind by the Skull. Zemo and Sin escape out, but Sin betrays Zemo by shooting off his teleporting device, leaving him stranded in the desert while Sin leaves.</p><h3>Book One: The Serpent</h3><p>In Lower Manhattan, Steve Rogers and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sharon-carter/4005-38227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38227\">Sharon Carter </a>attempt to calm down two sides of protesters arguing about whether or not there should be rebuilding at a 'sacred site' (implied to be Ground Zero). But the mob breaks into violence, and the entire crowd and the police get embroiled in a chaotic riot.</p><p>In Antarctica, Sin and her henchmen arrive at a secret base - the site where the hammer fell. The base is guarded by the Thule Society occultists, who have remained alive all these years through Nazi super-science. Sin and her troops forcibly break into the base, killing the scientists, and Sin finds the ancient hammer. She wields it, and becomes reborn and possessed by the power of <em>Skadi</em> - Herald of the <a href=\"/the-serpent/4005-77306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77306\">Serpent</a>.</p><p>Back at <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers-tower/4020-40830/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40830\">Avengers Tower </a>in Manhattan, Steve Rogers is disappointed about the earlier outbreak of violence. <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man </a>suggests to the entire team that they all stand beside him to announce the rebuilding of Asgard (which was destroyed in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/siege/4045-55985/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55985\">Siege</a>) to create good publicity and faith in the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>.</p><p>In Broxton, Oklahoma - the site of the fallen <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard </a>- a civilian named Rick wishes his neighbor goodbye as the family leaves the town due to financial issues. At Asgard, Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers hold a press conference to announce the rebuilding of Asgard - funded by Stark Resilient and opening up jobs for nearly 5000 people in Broxton.</p><p>While Tony's speech goes on, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin </a>watches from a distance, and ominously says that they are doomed. <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/watcher/4005-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\">The Watcher </a>makes a sudden appearance, and Odin rants at him - asking if he has come to witness Odin's greatest failure - but the Watcher remains impassive and leaves. <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor </a>finds his father, asking him to join the conference, but they get into an argument - with Odin saying that the city should be rebuilt in Asgard-space, not among mankind.</p><p>Deep in the Pacific Ocean, in the Marianas Trench, Skadi swims into a deep pit guarded by four giant serpents. She defeats them all and enters a chamber, where she comes face-to-face with the old Serpent for the first time. Back in Asgard, both Odin and <a href=\"/heimdall/4005-3508/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3508\">Heimdall </a>sense the return of the Serpent.</p><p>While the Avengers and the rest of the Asgardians are having a feast, Odin suddenly interrupts it and orders all of his people to return to Asgard-space. Thor tries to argue, but the father and son break into a physical exchange. Odin easily overpowers his son and strips <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir </a>from him, and then all the Asgardians depart from Midgard.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Serpent tells Skadi that they must turn the entire Earth into a planet of fear, and he summons the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-worthy/4060-58278/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58278\">Worthy</a>. From outer space, seven streams of light hit the planet and land in different locations.</p><h3>Book Two: The Worthy</h3><p>The Asgardians return to Asgard-space, and it is revealed that Odin has abandoned the Earth to the Serpent. Odin tells his people that he has fought the Serpent once, and that the enemy will create fear in the Earth and use it as its power source. He declares that the Asgardians have to purge Midgard in order to stop the Serpent. Thor confronts his father, but Odin easily creates a prison and orders his son imprisoned.</p><p>Back on Earth, in the supervillain prison known as the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">Raft</a>, one of the streams of light hits it - revealing a hammer. <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut </a>approaches the weapon and touches it, transforming into <em>Kuurth</em> - Breaker of Stone. Similar impacts have occurred in China, the Pacific Ocean, Paris, and even New York. At the N.Y. site of <a href=\"/yancy-street/4020-56905/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56905\">Yancy Street</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards </a>and the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/future-foundation/4060-57552/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57552\">Future Foundation </a>begin running analyses on the event.</p><p>In Brazil, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk </a>and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/betty-ross/4005-3445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3445\">Red She-Hulk </a>investigate one of the crash sites, and the Hulk grabs the hammer that fell from space, transforming into <em>Nul</em> - Breaker of Worlds.

He notes that he couldn't absorb the hammer's properties. His girlfriend, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/titania/4005-4943/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4943\">Titania</a>, successfully lifts it however...and is transformed into <em>Skirn</em> - Breaker of Men. Skirn tells the Absorbing Man that they have to go north to collect <em>his</em> hammer.</p><p>And in the Pacific Ocean, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/attuma/4005-15779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15779\">Attuma </a>has found his own hammer and becomes <em>Nerkkod</em> - Breaker of Oceans. He begins destroying an oil pipeline. In Asgard, Odin and his people have started to build war machines for the razing of Earth. On the rest of the planet, the Worthy are rampaging and the entire Earth is thrown into fear and chaos.</p><p>But in the USA's capital of Washington, DC, Skadi and an army of Nazi mechs appear and launch an assault on the nation's capital.</p><h3>Book Three: The Hammer that Fell on Yancy Street</h3><p>Captain America (Bucky Barnes), <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a>, and the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\">Falcon </a>mobilize to Washington to stop Skadi and her troops. Elsewhere on Earth, the rest of the Worthy continue their rampages, and in Brazil - the Avengers save Red She-Hulk from a mad Nul. On Yancy Street, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing </a>grabs the hammer that landed there, and is transformed into <em>Angrir </em>- Breaker of Souls. He slams his hammer on the ground, destroying a large portion of the street.</p><p>In Asgard, the building of weapons continues, and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki </a>pays a visit to his imprisoned brother. With the help of some spiked food, Loki incapacitates the jailors and frees Thor. They meet with a number of Thor's friends who disagree with Odin and are plotting to save Midgard. Thor's allies tell him that Odin has sealed Asgard off, but that they have other means to spirit Thor off to Midgard to help rally the Earth's forces. But Odin learns of the meeting and interrupts it, and tells Thor that he doesn't know the threat he's facing, and that a prophecy is in the works.</p><p>Thor refuses to back down - asking for permission to stand with Midgard. Odin concedes to his request, and tells him that he has to stop the Serpent before the god reaches the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/yggdrasil/4020-55875/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55875\">World Tree </a>in Oklahoma, or Asgard will destroy the Earth. Odin sends Thor back to Midgard, giving him back Mjolnir as well.</p><p>Back in Washington, Bucky is fighting Skadi, but she easily overpowers him and kills him - piercing his chest with her hammer. Captain America dies, his death marking the first casualty in the Serpent's War.</p><h3>Book Four: Worlds on Fire</h3><p>Just outside Broxton, Thor arrives on Earth, and is met by a group of local men armed with rifles. They are guarding the road into Broxton and tell Thor to move on - saying that they don't need the help of superheroes to protect their own people. The man known as Rick is among them. Thor flies off.</p><p>Around the world, the Worthy are creating fear and chaos, powering the Serpent and restoring his youth and energy. In San Francisco, the X-Men tackle Kuurth. In Paris, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/grey-gargoyle/4005-6816/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6816\">Grey Gargoyle </a>has found a hammer and been reborn as <em>Mokk</em> - Breaker of Faith. <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a>, Iron Man, and Widow gather around the fallen body of Bucky, and Thor meets them. Thor warns them that the Serpent strikes at man's fear, and feeds off humanity's emotions. He also tells them of Odin's plan to cleanse the planet by wiping out humanity. Nick Fury then tells Thor and Iron Man that they need to go and get Captain America.</p><p>The Big Three of the Avengers reunite in preparation for a counterattack. Captain America tasks Iron Man with building weaponry to fight against the enchanted weapons of the Worthy. Thor tells Captain America about the prophecy - that Thor is to slaughter the Serpent at the price of his own life. Cap replies that such a loss is unacceptable, and tells Thor to confront the Serpent, suggesting that the god of fear might be afraid of him if the prophecy is true.</p><p>In British Columbia, the dead bodies of Atlanteans begin floating to the surface due to the work of Nerkkod. This act provides the necessary power for the Serpent to summon his kingdom of fear - an army of giants as well as a city from Antarctica. Thor flies off to confront the Serpent, Iron Man heads to the site of fallen Asgard in Oklahoma, and Cap joins the battle against Skadi's army in Manhattan.</p><p>In Broxton, Tony sacrifices his sobriety as a petition to Odin - and tells Thor's father that he needs Asgardian workshops to build weapons for the Avengers. Thor confronts the now-young Serpent, but the god of fear teleports him into Manhattan...where he is confronted by Nul and Angrir.</p><h3>Book Five: Brawl</h3><p>In Manhattan, Captain America and the Avengers fight Skadi while Thor tackles Nul and Angrir. With regret, Thor kills Angrir - the Thing - by using Mjolnir to fly right through him. Thor then battles Nul and ends up using his teleportation powers to send the Hulk into space.The fight has left Thor severely weakened however, and he collapses due to his injuries.</p><p>But <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Franklin </a>and <a href=\"/valeria-richards/4005-2470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2470\">Valeria Richards </a>are able to find the dying Angrir, and using Franklin's reality-warping powers, succeed in restoring the Thing back to full health.</p><p>The Serpent and his floating kingdom make their appearance in Manhattan, and the Asgardian easily defeats the Avengers with a single hammer-strike. Captain America throws his shield at the Serpent, but the god of fear catches it and shockingly succeeds in destroying the iconic weapon. He then releases a huge burst of energy that levels a good portion of Manhattan.</p><p>A while later, the Avengers come to and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man </a>requests for Cap's permission to run off and try to find <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May</a>. Captain America allows him to, and forebodingly tells the rest of the Avengers that they are going to lose.</p><h3>Book Six: Blood-Tied &amp; Doomed</h3><p>The remaining Avengers carry a defeated Thor to the ruins of Avengers Tower, where Heimdall's Observatory is. The New Avengers team, led by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, agrees to stay back and help the evacuation of New York. While the main Avengers team travel to Asgard-space using the Observatory, in order to ask Odin to heal his son.</p><p>In Asgard-space, the Avengers appear in front of Odin, and Captain America verbally slams the All-Father - telling him to fix Thor. Odin teleports the Avengers back to Broxton, and tends to his son. When Thor has recovered, Odin bestows to his son his armor - the armor that Odin wore when he first razed the Earth in order to stop the Serpent the first time. He gives the suit of armor as protection, and also gives Thor the Odinsword, also known by its true name <em>Ragnarok</em>. Odin also tells Thor that the Serpent is his lost brother, and that he has tried to wipe the god of fear from Asgardian history.</p><p>In <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/svartalfheim/4020-55996/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55996\">Svartalfheim</a>, Tony (who has been busy building weapons for the Avengers with dark elves) meets with Odin and Thor. The weapons have Stark-tech and <a href=\"/uru/4055-40970/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40970\">uru </a>enchantments, and are designed to transform the Avengers into powerful warriors. The weapons are all thrown into a pit of boiling uru so Odin can bless them, and Iron Man jumps in with his <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/iron-man-armor-mk-xvii/4055-57444/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57444\">Bleeding-Edge </a>armor, to bless the suit as well.</p><p>In Manhattan, Spider-Man is searching for his Aunt May, and succeeds in finding her, but his aunt tells him to get back into the battle as it is his responsibility.</p><p>And in the ruins of Asgard in Oklahoma, Captain America heads out to the road barricade that the men of Broxton has set up. The floating kingdom of the Serpent approaches, and Cap makes his final stand while the rest of the civilians run away. On the kingdom, the Serpent has prepared for the final battle by re-gathering all the members of the Worthy (save for Nul and Angrir).</p><h3>Book Seven: Thor's Day</h3><p><strong>Friday:</strong></p><p>The Serpent and his floating kingdom have arrived to use the site of fallen Asgard in Oklahoma in order to destroy the World Tree and eventually kill Odin. In the ruins of Asgard, Iron Man and Thor reappear, and begin arming the Avengers with their weapons. The Avengers armed with the Asgardian weaponry include Iron Man himself, Spider-Man, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>, Black Widow, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Dr. Strange</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Ms. Marvel</a>, and Red She-Hulk.</p><p>Elsewhere, the man known as Rick enters a shelter where his family (and others) are hiding, and he tells his wife that he's going back out there to help Captain America. He says that it wasn't right that they all (the men guarding the road barricade) abandoned Cap, and says that if this is the end, he doesn't want to be afraid anymore.</p><p>The final battle of the Serpent's War has begun. Thor charges towards the god of fear - who has transformed into a gigantic actual serpent - and throws Mjolnir. But the Serpent's flaming breath hurls the hammer aside, leading Thor to proceed to attack with Ragnarok.</p><p>On the ground, Captain America is fighting several of Sin's Nazi mechs with the aid of the newly-weaponized Avengers, and Mjolnir falls nearby, creating a huge explosion. Cap is temporarily stunned, but is helped to his feet, by Rick. Cap tells him that they're all Avengers now, and picking up the fallen Mjolnir, Captain America holds the hammer up in the air and yells, 'Avengers Assemble!'</p><p>The Avengers then get engaged in a final battle with the Serpent and his Worthy. As they do so, the tide begins to turn in the team's favor, and the fear in the entire planet begins to weaken as hope breaks through. Widow and Hawkeye tackle the Serpent's henchmen, Iron Fist and Strange take on Skirn, Red She-Hulk fights Nerkkod, Wolverine deals with Kuurth, and Captain America has a rematch with Skadi.</p><p>In Asgard, Odin prepares his armies to raze the Earth, as the Serpent has arrived near the World Tree. But just as Odin's armies appear, Thor succeeds in killing the Serpent by planting Ragnarok into the dragon's head. As fear subsides and hope builds around the planet, the Serpent and his Worthy have been defeated. Odin then uses his power to summon all of the Worthy's hammers to him, and he rushes towards his fallen son, who is dead.</p><p>One day later, on <strong>Saturday</strong>, the Avengers begin building a funeral pyre to burn Thor's body on the grounds of fallen Asgard. At the site of the battle, Captain America approaches Odin, who is by the corpse of the Serpent. Odin then casts all of the Asgardians out of Asgard-space and remains in there by himself, forever watching over the body of the Serpent.</p><p>On <strong>Sunday</strong>, Captain America and Widow attend the funeral of Bucky Barnes at Arlington National Cemetery. On <strong>Monday</strong>, in Svartalfheim, the dwarves there begin melting the enchanted weapons used by the Avengers, and one of the dark elves (<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/splitlip/4005-85251/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85251\">Splitlip</a>) present Stark with Cap's remade shield. On <strong>Tuesday</strong>, Tony presents the shield (which has now been made stronger with uru enhancements) to Cap, and offers to buffer down a scar on the shield. Cap says it's fine, and that the scar gives the shield some character.</p><p>On <strong>Wednesday</strong>, the Avengers begin the rebuilding of Manhattan. And on <strong>Thursday</strong> - formerly known as <em>Thor's Day</em> - Rick greets his new neighbor in Broxton. And a mysterious light is seen hitting the site of fallen Asgard...</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/alpha-flight-by-pak-and-van-lente-volume-one/4000-310919/\"

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2>After his last defeat at the hands of Spider-Man, the Green Goblin plans to make his foe as the heir to his \"legacy\" by slowly brainwashing Peter and having him go on a sleepwalking rampage as the Green Goblin. Eventually, Osborn kidnaps Peter and brings him to an old estate of his where he attempts to have Peter embrace the darkness as Osborn once did and become the next Goblin. After going through many tortures, Peter becomes mentally fragile and was about to drink a Goblin serum presented to him by Osborn but manages to overcome his foe's mind games and despite being weakened, defeats the Goblin but in the process, Peter is forced to accept the fact that him and Norman are alike and the villain vows before escaping that the next time they meet, one of them will die.Â Â <br/> <h2>Full Plot</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1666806-norman_osborn_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1666806\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.976\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1666806-norman_osborn_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1666806\"><img alt=\"Norman &amp; Kolina\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1666806-norman_osborn_35.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1666806-norman_osborn_35.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>Norman &amp; Kolina</figcaption></figure>At the end of the Final Chapter story arc, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\" href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" slug=\"norman-osborn\">Norman Osborn</a>Â insanity had furtherÂ succumbedÂ to insanity due to <a data-ref-id=\"4015-45806\" href=\"/gathering-of-the-five/4015-45806/\" slug=\"gathering-of-the-five\">the Gathering of Five</a> ritual and after he was defeated by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\">Spider-Man</a> and taken to a hospital, a group of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-7115\" href=\"/scriers/4060-7115/\" slug=\"scriers\">Scriers</a> led by Norman's friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24649\" href=\"/donald-menken/4005-24649/\" slug=\"donald-menken\">Donald Menken </a>saved him and helped him regain his sanity privately.Â However, while in the care of Scriers, Norman has become dependent on drugs made for him by his private physician Dr. Albert Bendix to maintain his sanity.

He then throws the body of a person wearing a Spider-Man to his loyal followers who viciously kill him following Norman's order. The man under the costume is revealed to be Dr. Bendix. At hisÂ Estate, Norman opens up to Kolina and tells her about the building and the loss of the Osborn family fortune and after Kolina shows her care and support for his efforts in reclaiming his fortune, Norman is reminded more of Emily and his love for Kolina continues to grow.Â <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peter has been suffering from intense Goblin-related dreams and delusions but is still unaware of Norman's plot. While visiting <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\" href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" slug=\"aunt-may\">Aunt May</a>, Peter is given by his aunt a music CD that was sent to her by a friend of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\" href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" slug=\"uncle-ben\">Uncle Ben</a>'s and asks Peter to copy the music onto a tape for her. However, the CD was actually sent by Norman and it contains subliminal messages aimed at bending Peter to Osborn's will. When Peter listens to the CD, he starts suffering from more delusionsÂ <br/>Â <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1666807-norman_osborn_36.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1666807\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.848\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1666807-norman_osborn_36.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1666807\"><img alt=\"Norman lashes out at Kolina\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1666807-norman_osborn_36.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1666807-norman_osborn_36.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>Norman lashes out at Kolina</figcaption></figure>One night, while searching for Norman, Kolina accidentally stumbles upon Norman's secret lair where Norman was there, wearing his new Goblin Lord costume. Startled by Kolina's intrusion, Norman hurled by instincts a Pumpkin Bomb at her, almost killing her. Norman regretted his action and after seeing Emily in Kolina yet again, decides to tell the nurse about his Goblin-side Kolina tells Norman that the Goblin serum ruined his life but Norman objects that the serum made his life better. Kolina tells Norman that he has lost his mind, provoking him into lashing out at her following Menken's suggestion to kill because she knows too much but Â her resemblance to Emily stop him from hurting her. Menken pulls out a gun and attempts to finish her himself but this enrages Osborn who viciously attacks Menken and would have killed him had it not for Kolina's interference. After taking his medicine and calming down, Norman orders his servants to take both Kolina and Menken to his Adirondack Estate.Â Â <br/>Â <br/>Peter has a dream that involves the Green Goblin holding the deceased body of Spider-Man and throwing into the waters below the Brooklyn Bridge. The Goblin then unmasks to reveal Peter underneath. Then on, the body of Dr. Bendix, dressed in a Spider-Man is found by the police who are convinced that this is not the real Spider-Man and report that the Green Goblin was seen disposing of the body. Peter realizes that the murder and the dream are somehow related.Â After having another nightmare, Peter is informed by his friends <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17620\" href=\"/randy-robertson/4005-17620/\" slug=\"randy-robertson\">Randy Robertson</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6830\" href=\"/glory-grant/4005-6830/\" slug=\"glory-grant\">Glory Grant </a>that the Green Goblin has attacked them so he goes to investigate but becomes increasingly worried when he is unable to find him.

After saving <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15447\" href=\"/paul-stacy/4005-15447/\" slug=\"paul-stacy\">Paul Stacy</a> from the fire, he is informed that the Goblin was also responsible for this and he is angered by the fact that the Goblin attacked while he was asleep.

As a child, Norman's abusive father, Amberson Osborn,Â  locked Norman alone in one of the family'sÂ dark empty houses Â in order to cure his son's fear of the dark.Â While he was alone in the house, Â NormanÂ encountered and fearedÂ a \"green goblin-like\"Â monster stalking him.Â Alone in the dark, Norman feared the monster would eat him once the darkness is replaced by the light, so he came to grip with the darkness, wishing it would never leave him.Â That night, he realised that the Darkness is better than the light.Â  Encounters like these made NormanÂ develop a need for power and wealth so he would not become a failure like his father. He sought to regain the wealth he once had andÂ he would stop at nothing to reach his goal. Norman wants Peter to have the same experiences and tries to coerce Peter into \"embracing\" the darkness as Norman did in the past, all in an effort to make Peter the heir to his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56882\" href=\"/goblin-legacy/4060-56882/\" slug=\"goblin-legacy\">Goblin Legacy</a>.Â  Norman tells Peter that he realized Peter was the rightful heir when he saw Peter secretly visiting the hospital during Normie Osborn's birth in the story. After putting Peter through many tortures, Peter's spirit seems to have been finally broken, as he is evading the light and heading for the darkness. Norman presents Peter with a Goblin Formula and before a mentally fragile Peter could drink the serum, he sees an image of Aunt May telling him how much of a good boy he's always been. Peter throws the glass in the Goblin's face and the two foes fight. Despite being mentally and physically weak, Peter finally manages to defeat the Goblin. However, before escaping on his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55762\" href=\"/goblin-glider/4055-55762/\" slug=\"goblin-glider\">Glider</a>, Norman proclaims that he has won because Peter chose the darkness over the light. The Goblin tells Peter that they are both alike and promises Peter that the next time they meet, one of them will die.",

After leading Peter on a chase, Ezekiel tells Peter that receiving his powers may not have been an accident and that the spider that bit him may have intended to give him his powers before it was killed by the radiation, stunning Peter. He also tells Peter that his powers have made him a representative of totemistic forces and warns him of a powerful totem eater named Morlun who will eventually come to to hunt him down and kill him. Because Ezekiel admires Peter's heroics, he wants to help him and he offers him the protection of a safe house that will prevent Morlun from finding him but Peter refuses to hide. While Peter was applying for a job as a science teacher in his old High School, Morlun, the totem eater Ezekiel spoke of, watched Peter from afar causing Peter's Spider-Sense to trigger at a very high degree. Later on, when Peter was saving people from a burning building, Morlun appeared and punched Spidey through the building and on to a car.

Spider-Man, barley surviving the battle, managed to escape and sought Ezekiel's help. However, Ezekiel tells Peter that there's nothing he can do now that Morlun has found him because Morlun possesses the unique ability of tracking his prey anywhere once contact has been made. Distraught, Peter leaves and he is attacked again by Morlun. As they fought again around , thinking he will die, Peter calls MJ and Aunt May, telling them that he loves them. Just when Morlun was about to feed on Spider-Man, Ezekiel appeared just in time, saving Peter and even managing to draw blood from Morlun. However, they were still out-matched and Morlun fed on Ezekiel and threw his seemingly dead body into the waters below before walking away.</p><p>After failing to find Ezekiel's body, Peter takes a sample of the blood Ezekiel made Morlun shed during the fight to his home and studies it. After studying the blood, Peter reasones that because he recieved his powers from the bite of an irradiated spider, he can re-dose himself with radiation thus making his blood unpalatable for Morlun. Spidey infiltrates a nuclear power plant and doses himself with a radioactive fluid before seemingly collapsing. As expected, Morlun, accompanied by his servant Dex, made his way to the power plant and attempted to feed on the unconscious Spider-Man. However, as soon as Morlun touched Spidey, he was poisoned by the radiation Peter dosed himself with and began to grow weak. Spider-Man then starts to mercilessly beat Morlun around the plant. As Morlun pleads Spider-Man to spare him, promising to leave and never return, Spidey ponders wether he should kill Morlun or not. However, Dex makes this decision instead and kills Morlun with a gun because he can no longer handle his master's mistreatment. As Morlun dies, he tells Peter that it wasn't personal, he was just hungry. Feeling sympathy for Dex, he lets him go and goes to Ezekiel's building to inform the board of the CEO's death. However, when he arrived the building was empty and he was relieved to see Ezekiel, alive and well, leaving in a limo.</p><h2>Shade</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1325668\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.548\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1325668\"><img alt=\"Spidey vs Shade\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg 500w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey vs Shade\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg 500w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71543/1325668-shade_spidey_h2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey vs Shade</figcaption></figure><p>Some time later, Jenny, a homeless student Peter befriended informed him of the disappearance of some other homeless kids so Peter goes to investigate as Spider-Man.

He also warnes Peter that Morlun and Shathra are not the only ones hunting him and another more powerful foe is coming for him. After the conversation, Peter leaves and decides to go to to sort things out with Mary Jane once and for all. Ironically, Mary Jane is thinking the same thing and decides to go to . With neither having any luck in finding the other, they both decide to return from where they came.</p><p>And even if it`s not an actual part of The Spider Totem, the following story (in ASM 491) is still the continuation of the previous part. This is how it goes.</p><p>By coincidence, Peter and MJ bump into each other in the airport. However, their reunion is cut short by the appearance of Doctor Doom, who is targeted by some suicide bombers. After Spidey and Captain America (who happened to be in the airport, as Dooms bodyguard) take down the bombers, Peter introduces MJ to Captain. In the end, they both realize how much they need each other because Mary Jane is what keeps Petey going on as Spider-Man and they finally reconcile. Also, because Aunt May knew Peter's identity, she and MJ became much closer.</p><h2>The Book of Ezekiel</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/339143-72464-gatekeeper.PNG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-339143\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.99581589958159\" data-width=\"239\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 239px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/339143-72464-gatekeeper.PNG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-339143\"><img alt=\"Ezekiel tells Peter about the Gatekeeper\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px\" data-width=\"239\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/339143-72464-gatekeeper.PNG\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/339143-72464-gatekeeper.PNG 239w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ezekiel tells Peter about the Gatekeeper\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/339143-72464-gatekeeper.PNG\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13536/339143-72464-gatekeeper.PNG 239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px\" data-width=\"239\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ezekiel tells Peter about the Gatekeeper</figcaption></figure><p>Some time later, Spidey met up with Ezekiel after taking down a thug and invites him over for dinner.

Ezekiel chains Peter to a column in a temple and stabs him with a knife to have his blood flow into the spider runes on the floor. Then a giant spider monster (probably the Gatekeeper) appears, ready to kill Peter as Ezekiel walks away. In a state of panic, Peter uses his spider-sense to bond with Ezekiel's mind where Ezekiel sees all the heroic things Peter has done with his powers and he comes to the realization that he has wasted his life by only seeking wealth and that Peter is the worthy hero so he goes back and has the spider monster kill him instead of Peter. A shaman named Miguel who was at the runes buries Ezekiel and tells Peter that Ezekiel has redeemed himself by saving Peter. Peter asks Miguel weither his powers came from science or magic, and Miguel tells Peter that they came from both because they co-exist and in any case Peter was meant to have them.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/amazing-spider-man-by-jms-ultimate-collection-volume-one/4000-233715/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-233715\">The Amazing Spider-Man by JMS Ultimate Collection vol. 1</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-by-jms-ultimate-collection-volume-two/4000-244343/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-244343\">The Amazing Spider-Man by JMS Ultimate Collection vol. 2</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-through-the-decades-spider-man-through-the-decades/4000-307684/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-307684\">The Amazing Spider-Man: Through the Decades</a></li><li><a href=\"/best-of-spider-man-volume-one/4000-259630/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-259630\">The Best of Spider-Man vol. 1</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-best-of-spider-man-volume-two/4000-259632/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-259632\">The Best of Spider-Man vol. 2</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-best-of-spider-man-volume-three/4000-259633/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-259633\">The Best of Spider-Man vol. 3</a></li><li><a href=\"/best-of-spider-man-volume-four/4000-259699/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-259699\">The Best of Spider-Man vol. 4</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-383935/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-383935\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #82</a></li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spiderman-37/4000-573666/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-573666\">Spiderman #37</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spiderman-38/4000-573667/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-573667\">Spiderman #38</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spiderman-39/4000-573668/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-573668\">Spiderman #39</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

The Vulture then flies away with Spider-Man and reveals thatÂ he was going to use his shair ofÂ the money Spider-Man madeÂ him andÂ ElectroÂ lose during the last fight to save his grandson from a tumour. Vulture then rips off the bandages covering some parts of Peter's face and is disappointed to see a \"nobody\" under the mask as he was expecting Spider-Man to be someone famous in his civilian life. Vulture then drops Peter off but he is saved by the Black Cat who fights and defeats the Vulture and reveals that she was hired by the Owl to track him and Electro down. The Owl was just using Spider-Man to track down the two villaines because they had stolenÂ money from him. Felicia warns Vulture if he ever attacked her ex-boyfriend again she would kill before brutally scarring him in the face. She then goes to check on Peter and takes him to his appartment. Also, MJ has made her way back toÂ New YorkÂ <br/>Electro is seen being tortured by the Owl as punishment for his betrayal and he shows him a battered and one-eyed Vulture as an example to anyone who would ever betray the Owl.Â Â <br/>The photo that was taken by the nurse makes its way to J.

Then Doctor Octopus appears and attacks Spider-Man, and their battle causes a lot of property damage until Ock is knocked out byÂ cops using a sedative dart and they blame Spider-Man for the damage caused by the battle. Then a SWAT team attacks him, hoping to take his mask off to claim Jameson's reward. but they are called off by Captain LaMont, an ally of Spider-Man. Spider-Man swingsÂ off andÂ the copsÂ take the unconcious Doc OckÂ away for some unusual testing.Â <br/>Peter meetsÂ up with Mary Jane in a Cafe andÂ she tells him that Felicia has discovered that Venom is back in town and is arranging a meeting of super-villaines. PeterÂ urgesÂ MJ to leave town again but she refuses, revealing thatÂ she is now carrying a gun, and although Peter is uncomfortable with this, heÂ eventually agrees and lets her stay.Â Â Â Â <br/>Peter then goes to the Daily Bugle where many Spider-Man imposters attempt to cash in on Jonah's reward by revealing their own identity.

Meanwhile, Peter has been having a recurring nightmare and since <a href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane</a> is currently in California, he is unable to confide in anyone so he goes off for a swing to clear his head. In the middle of a rainstorm, as if drawn to each other, Spider-Man and the Green Goblin meet each other and they immediately engage each in battle. They fight to a stalemate until Norman stabs Peter in the shoulder with a piece of pipe but instead of pressing his advantage, Norman tells Peter how he has always considered him as a member of the Osborn Family and before leaving, Osborn leaves Peter an invitation to an Osborn family reunion which is going to be a funeral.</p><p>When Peter returned home, he is shocked to see footage of <a href=\"/the-death-of-gwen-stacy/4045-43220/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43220\">Gwen Stacy's death</a> on tv. The Green Goblin had released the video to the media and he is stating that <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen</a> died because of Spider-Man's carelessness while the Goblin tried to save her. Peter then interrupts a meeting between Osborn's company and another company about an upcoming merger. Norman taunts Peter a bit before the latter storms off.</p><p>Spider-Man then meets up with <a href=\"/j-jonah-jameson/4005-1487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J. Jonah Jameson</a> in the middle of a rain storm and tells the publisher that the Goblin's statements are false. Spidey demands that Jonah changes his paper's headline which says \"Spider-Man Implicated\" but Jonah will never believe him unless Spidey takes his mask off. Spidey refuses and swings away.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1581442-green_goblin_36.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1581442\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 250px\" data-ratio=\"0.948\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1581442-green_goblin_36.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1581442\"><img alt=\"The Goblin force feed Flash Whiskey\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1581442-green_goblin_36.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1581442-green_goblin_36.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>The Goblin force feed Flash Whiskey</figcaption></figure><p>The Green Goblin kidnaps <a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Flash Thompson</a>, a recovering alcoholic, and force feeds him whiskey before having him ram a truck into the High School Peter works at and as a result, Flash goes into a coma.

He sat next to a wall and the Goblin joined him there. Peter starts telling Osborn about the recuring dream he's been having in which he sees Gwen Stacy under the rubble of an airplane explosion. Peter then starts telling Norman how wonderful Gwen was and if Norman had actually known her, he would have never killed her because Gwen's personality would have fixed him. Peter tells Norman that everyday he thinks about killing Norman for what he did to Gwen but that's something he will never do because, despite everything, he doesn't even hate the Goblin and thinks that Gwen would have never wanted him to become a murderer. Peter feels that as long as refuses to hate the Goblin, Gwen lives inside him but when he doesn't, and gives in to the hate, Gwen dies. The Goblin warns him that in sparing his life, Peter is endangering the lives of others but Peter replies that he knows that Norman would never hurt his own grandson and even if Norman does kill Peter's loved ones, it will only strengthen his resolve and his dream meant that the Goblin will never win. Peter goes on to say that he doesn't have to kill the Goblin or even put him away in jail because just being who he is \"is life without parole\". With that said, Peter walks away and leaves the Goblin, defeating him by refusing to play his game.</p><p>In the epilogue Peter visits Flash in the hospital and the next morning, Spidey delivers Norman a gun in his office and Norman contemplates suicide.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-best-of-spider-man-2-volume-two/4000-259632/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-259632\">The Best of Spider-Man #2 - Volume Two</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">\"The Black Mirror\" is a story arc crafted by writer <a href=\"/scott-snyder/4040-58926/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-58926\">Scott Snyder.</a> The concept of the story is that <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a> is its own character that reflects its seedy nature upon those who try and protect it. It focuses on two main protagonists, <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson</a> as Gotham's Batman and <a href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Commissioner Jim Gordon</a>. Gotham puts both of the city's protectors to the test, having Dick discover what it truly means to be Batman in Gotham as he sees a darker side of the city; meanwhile, Gordon's estranged son <a href=\"/james-gordon-jr/4005-70633/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70633\">James Gordon Jr.</a> returns to Gotham, bringing a dark past with him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The story began in November 2010's issue of <a href=\"/detective-comics/4050-18058/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18058\">Detective Comics</a> and wrapped up in August 2011. Originally, the title was planned to have Dick Grayson as Batman in the main feature (drawn by <a href=\"/jock-mark-simpson/4040-5653/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5653\">Jock</a>) and Gordon in a backup role (also written by Snyder), drawn by <a href=\"/francesco-francavilla/4040-46908/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-46908\">Francesco Francavilla</a>. When DC dropped backup features from all their books, it was decided that Dick and Gordon would alternate in the book's starring roles. Snyder would come to describe The Black Mirror as \"one big story\" with both Dick and Gordon's plot lines intersecting and interacting with each other numerous times. The story is notable as the last to appear in Detective Comics before DC's September 2011 relaunch.</p><h2>Plot Overview</h2><figure style=\"width: 660px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1590234-picture_013.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1590234\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.569696969697\" data-width=\"660\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1590234-picture_013.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1590234\"><img alt=\"The Dealer\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/1590234-picture_013.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1590234-picture_013.jpg 660w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/1590234-picture_013.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Dealer</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shortly after <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Bruce Wayne</a> appointed <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson</a> to be the Batman of <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a>, a string of mysterious crimes occur involving weapons from the cast of Batman's rogues gallery. Grayson soon finds out that there is a secret auction called the Mirror House, led by a man called <a href=\"/the-dealer/4005-75068/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75068\">The Dealer</a> who sells weapons and items used by many different villains to the highest bidder. Dick disguises himself as a guest and infiltrates the Mirror House where the Dealer auctions <a href=\"/crowbar/4055-56524/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56524\">the Crowbar</a> used in the vicious beating of <a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd</a> at the hands of the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a> many years ago. Dick's cover is eventually blown and he is exposed to a gas that causes him to hallucinate while being attacked by the crazed members of the Mirror House. He manages to escape, and after recovering from the brutal attack, attempts to take down the Dealer who manages to escape. In the end, Dick recollects how he never expected that kind of viscousness from the Gotham citizen and he feels that the city is getting meaner and wilder.</p><figure style=\"width: 267px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1590424-screen_capture_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1590424\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4794007490637\" data-width=\"267\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1590424-screen_capture_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1590424\"><img alt=\"James Jr.\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1590424-screen_capture_2.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1590424-screen_capture_2.png 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\"></a><figcaption>James Jr.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile, Commissioner Gordon has his own problems to deal with; his son, James Jr. has come back to Gotham. When <a href=\"/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Barbara</a> hears about her brother coming back, she's none too happy, claiming that James Jr. is a dangerous person, claiming he hurt, and possibly killed someone named \"Betsy.\" Gordon doesn't know what to believe, but is soon confronted by his son. James Jr. tells his father that he's alright now, he's come to terms with the fact that he's on medication, and wants to start a new life in Gotham by getting a job at <a href=\"/leslie-thompkins/4005-3740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3740\">Leslie Thompkin's</a> clinic. In order for James to work at the clinic, he'll need a referral, and knowing that his father is close to the Waynes, he asks if he can get Dick Grayson to help him. Knowing that Dick possibly feels the same way about James as Barbara does, he remains conflicted. While Gordon tries to deal with his son's return, he opens up a cold case, trying to capture a child serial killer known only as the Peter Pan Killer. In his confrontation with the killer, it is revealed that the killer tried to abduct James in the past while the Gordons were on vacation, but was scared nearly to death by everything surrounding the boy. It was this very same vacation where Barbara's friend Betsy went missing, originally leading Gordon to think that James had something to do with it. Unable to get a confession before Batman's intervention, Gordon is left even more confused about who exactly his son is.</p><figure style=\"width: 396px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1827624-screen_capture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1827624\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0050505050505\" data-width=\"396\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1827624-screen_capture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1827624\"><img alt=\"Sonia Zucco\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-width=\"396\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1827624-screen_capture_1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1827624-screen_capture_1.png 396w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sonia Zucco\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1827624-screen_capture_1.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1827624-screen_capture_1.png 396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-width=\"396\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sonia Zucco</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Sometime later, both Gordon and Dick investigate a bizarre crime in which a corpse of a orca whale was left in the lobby of a well known community bank in Gotham. Inside the corpse is the body of a young woman, who was eaten alive. Gordon points out to Dick that the banks owner, Sonia Branch, changed her name sometime back and is actually <a href=\"/sonia-zucco/4005-77525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77525\">Sonia Zucco</a>, the daughter of <a href=\"/anthony-zucco/4005-22815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22815\">Anthony Zucco</a>, the man who killed Dick's mother and father. By all accounts, Sonia is a good person, completely detached from her father, but someone has it out for her as the woman in the whale's stomach was her co-worker and best friend. Before Dick leaves, Gordon tells him about James, and asks Dick to meet with him. He also asks Dick to give him his honest opinion, if he thinks James Jr has changed, or if there's something still \"sinister\" about him. That night, Dick tries to investigate why anyone would be harassing Sonia in such a way, but Sonia gives him nothing to work with. Eventually though, through a listening device, Dick comes to find that she's being harassed by a new face in organized crime by the name of <a href=\"/bixby-rhodes/4005-77563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77563\">Bixby Rhodes</a> aka Roadrunner.</p><figure style=\"width: 628px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1787908-screen_capture.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1787908\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1703821656051\" data-width=\"628\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1787908-screen_capture.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1787908\"><img alt=\"Roadrunner\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/1787908-screen_capture.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1787908-screen_capture.png 628w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/1787908-screen_capture.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Roadrunner\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/1787908-screen_capture.png\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1787908-screen_capture.png 628w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/1787908-screen_capture.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Roadrunner</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dick confronts arms smuggler, Roadrunner, but is unable to find a definite link between his operations and the murder and whale carcass in Sonia's bank. Later that night he meets with Gordon who has brought Sonia along with him. Sonia admits to Dick that she was scared of him, and that he'd see her just as the daughter of Tony Zucco, what many have pinned her as. She denounces her father and his legacy, and explains that many of Gotham's older crime families had come to her based on her name, looking to see if she could \"invest\" their money for them, aka clean it up. She would turn them down, and wouldn't have a problem. But the new faces in Gotham wouldn't take no for an answer. One of them was Roadrunner and the other, the criminal who murdered her friend, putting her body in the whale, is a pirate by the name of <a href=\"/tiger-shark/4005-75861/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75861\">Tiger Shark</a>. Dick apologizes for his misconceptions of Sonia, and promises to make it up to her, by bringing Tiger Shark down. Off the coast, he searches for Tiger Shark, but doesn't have to look for long, as Tiger Shark's submarine finds him first.</p><figure style=\"width: 287px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1881957-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1881957\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0766550522648\" data-width=\"287\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1881957-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1881957\"><img alt=\"Tiger Shark\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" data-width=\"287\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1881957-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1881957-1.png 287w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tiger Shark\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1881957-1.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1881957-1.png 287w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" data-width=\"287\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tiger Shark</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Captured by Tiger Shark, Dick is not impressed with the \"King\" of pirates, viewing him as just another criminal in a fancy suit. He manages to escape a perilous situation with Tiger Shark's whales, but Tiger Shark gets away in the process, blowing a whole in his yacht, sinking it to the depths of the ocean. Due to his extensive training and planning ahead of time, Dick is able to surface from the wreckage unharmed, and with enough time to make his important meeting with James Gordon Jr. Dick meets with James in down town Gotham, surprised to see how much he's grown, and thanks him for the work he has done at the Thompson clinic. The conversation goes pleasantly enough, James even mentions he ran into one of their old acquaintances, Ben Wolff, a boy who once teased James. He continues to say that Wolff could be none the nicer now, and it's \"funny\" how some people have to grow into the people they're meant to become. Dick takes these words to heart, realizes something, and excuses himself from James.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Later, as Batman, Dick meets again with Sonia Branch. He accuses her of erasing the security footage so he wouldn't know where to start with her friend's murder, that way, Sonia could use Batman and direct him to Roadrunner first, then Tiger Shark, both criminals giving her heat, only one guilty of the murder. The situation becomes tense when Dick claims that he could have caught Tiger Shark if he knew about him first, but Sonia fires back that maybe he just failed. Sonia excuses herself with a falsely pleasant \"goodnight, Batman,\" wich leads to Dick making it a point to say \"Goodnight Ms. Zucco\" rather than \"Ms. Branch.\" As Dick leaves, he remembers a circus performer from his past, and what he said about his act, jumping from 80 feet in the air to a three foot pool of water, being all about judgement. Dick remembers the time he saw the performer judge the jump incorrectly, snapping his neck, dying instantly. Dick subconsciously relates this to his misjudgment of Sonia Zucco, but elsewhere, James Jr. enters the house that belongs to Ben Wolff, the same Wolff who teased him as a child. He descends into the basement where a tied up, mutilated Ben Wolff, missing all his limbs, jaw, and one of his eye, still alive and in agony, pleads for his life. James picks up a saw and asks Wolff \"Now, where were we?\"</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Sometime later, Jim Gordon visits Leslie to get her opinion on his son. Leslie raves about James Jr. saying he's been a great help, and has even volunteered for the infant nutrition program. Though Leslie approves of James, something doesn't sit well with Gordon, and he manages to swipe one of the experimental pills that James takes for his psychosis. Gordon visits Barbara, and asks her to analyze the pill. After some tests, Barbara find that the pill is formulated to actually stimulate the brain to create a psychosis in the one who takes it. The two are puzzled, as there is no way that James could actually spread the drug, and it wouldn't even affect adult minds, due to the dosage. Then it all clicks for Gordon, the nutrition program at Thompkins clinic. James would have access to mass quantities of infant formula, which could affect the young brains of children. With this realization, Gordon books it to James' apartment. All while this is happening, elsewhere at <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum</a>, during a routine physical examination, <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a> manages to escape from confinement. Gordon reaches James' apartment, but doesn't find him there. After further examination, he finds a box containing the key that belonged to Barbara's childhood friend Bessy, and was last seen the day before she disappeared on their vacation. Amongst that key, there are hundreds of other similar keys. Dealing with the thoughts of his son being what he feared the most, <a href=\"/harvey-bullock/4005-5554/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5554\">Harvey Bullock</a> shows up and informs the Commissioner that the Joker has escaped.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">With a gut feeling that the Joker would once again go after his family Commissioner Gordon calls his ex wife and James Jr's mother, <a href=\"/barbara-kean-gordon/4005-70561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70561\">Barbara Kean-Gordon</a>, who was in Gotham, to warn her. But it's too late, and as soon as he gets to her hotel room, he finds her curled up in the tub, infected with Joker toxin. With Barbara Sr. in intensive care, Dick goes after the Joker while Tim Drake and Barbara Gordon analyze the toxin and hotel security footage. Dick eventually finds Joker in the catacombs under Gotham. During their confrontation, calling Dick \"Little Bird,\" Joker claims he was waiting for \"his\" Batman to come back, and wasn't the one who attacked Barbara Sr. With Joker repeating \"it wasn't me\" something clicks with Dick, at the same time in the medical ward, Barbara Sr. wakes up and tells Jim \"It was him, Jim! It was him!\" Then, in <a href=\"/kord-tower/4020-57139/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57139\">Kord Tower</a>, just as Barbara sees the face of her adoptive mother's attacker, James Jr. sneaks up from behind her, and attacks his sister.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The hunt for Barbara is on, as James keeps her hidden in a platform under the bridge he fell off of when he was a child. He eventually contacts Dick, who he has deduced is Batman, and the truth comes out. James sees himself, a human unable to feel empathy and those like him to be superior, seeing Dick as the exact opposite of him. He returned to Gotham to challenge Dick, ultimately breaking him mentally. Dick tells James that they've already figured out his plan to tain the baby forumla, making children like him, but James informs him that he has no way of knowing if he had done it already or not. The climax of his twisted plan would be the murder of his sister and father, both of whom are great supports in Dick's life, and without them, James thought Dick would give up. Finished talking to Dick, James goes to finally Barbara, but she is able to surprise her brother, stabbing him in the eye. But the pain doesn't stop James, as he stalks his sister who has lost large amounts of blood, only able to crawl away. But before he is able to reach his sister, Dick shows up, finding James via a cellular tracker he implanted when he met with James days earlier. Tending to Barbara's wounds, Dick allows James to escape, knowing what waits for him on top of the bridge.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Thinking he's free, James hails his triumph, but is shot in the leg by his father. James pleads with his father to wait, but Jim only says \"no\" and shoots his son in the other leg. James tumbles off the edge of the bridge, but Jim catches him, promising his son that he's not letting go this time.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Sometime later, Jim meets with Dick, who is disassembling the crime lab that the GCPD didn't use. Jim thanks Dick for all his work, but Dick shrugs it off as not a big deal. Jim stops him and <i>thanks</i> him \"on all fronts\" indicating he may know more than he lets on. Dick tells him he's welcome, and continues on to report that his findings on the baby formula were inconclusive. The two speak for awhile about why they stay in Gotham, despite its nightmarish qualities, but both of them determine that they are to stick to Gotham for the long haul.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Though, down in the streets below, a mother walks with her newborn in a baby carriage. The baby's eyes are wide with a eerie look, indicating that James Jr may have succeeded with his plan, but only time will tell.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/batman-the-black-mirror/4050-43964/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-43964\">Batman: The Black Mirror</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Peter Parker learns of the death of his friend and ally Captain Jean DeWolf at the hands of a criminal who calls himself the Sin-Eater who has been going on a murderous rampage. Spider-Man and Daredevil team-up to stop this criminal.",
    "description": "<p>After saving a friend of Aunt May's Ernie Popchik from three muggers, Spider-Man is informed by some cops who support him that his good friend and ally <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2471\" href=\"/jean-dewolff/4005-2471/\" slug=\"jean-dewolff\">Jean DeWolff</a> was murdered in her sleep last night. He is shocked by the news and goes to Jean's precinct to offer his assistance in solving the murder. Stan Carter, the detective who was investigating the case tells him that Jean's badge was missing and it was most likely taken by the killer. Stan also told Spidey that Jean's admiration for him may have been more than professional and Peter admits that he liked her too.</p><p>Later on, Matt Murdock (Daredevil) is legally defending the same muggers that attacked Popchik in an arraignment trial and he successfully has them released on bail. Peter, who was at the hearing, expresses his disgust of Matt's actions and the lawyer instantly recognizes him as Spider-Man by his distinctive heartbeat. After the hearing, Matt confides in the presiding judge who is also his friend and mentor and tells him that despite his belief in equality under the law, he shares Peter's perspective on the whole situation but the judge tells him that he doesn't like working with guilty people and he seems indifferent on the situation. A masked man holding a shotgun, referring himself as the Sin-Eater, then enters the room and Matt attempts to fight him but fears compromising his secret identity as Daredevil so he ends up freezing in place and the villain kills the pleading judge with his shotgun. The gatherers at the courthouse flee after hearing the gunshot, and as Eater escapes through a window, Matt changes into Daredevil and goes to capture him. Meanwhile, Peter, who has also heard the gunshot, changes into Spider-Man and goes to fight Eater. Outside the courthouse, Spider-Man confronts the murderer who quickly opens fire on him and although Spider-Man dodges the shot, it hits and injures one of the gathering civilians instead. Spider-Man is overcome with guilt over unintentionally injuring a civilian, causing Peter to be defeated by the Eater, who is a formidable opponent. He then notices a police badge on Eater's belt and deduces that he was in fact Jean's killer and when accused, Eater admits of his crimes. And while the Eater is explaining about his mission, Spider-Man manages to punch him a few feet away. Spidey sees Aunt May lying on the ground and the Eater manages to escape because Spidey's web-shooters were damaged during the fight. Spider-Man becomes more determined than ever to capture this new villain.</p><p>Spider-Man then visits Carter in his office and informs him that the Eater is Jean's killer. Carter tells Spidey that the criminal's name refers to a superstitious belief about the absorption of the wrongs of other by killing people for their transgressions and taking symbolic token from the victims. Spider-Man then goes to Jean's apartment to search for some clues that might have been missed by the police. Although he doesn't find any, he comes upon a photograph of him and Jean, and he realizes that Jean was in fact in love with him, causing her death to become even more painful for him. During DeWolff's funeral, Matt was able to sense the Eater's presence using his enhanced senses but was unable to do anything about it because of the large gathering at the funeral. Later in the day, Eater kills the priest who oversaw the funeral of DeWolff. Spider-Man then goes on a rampage in the criminal underworld and attempts to force some low-level thugs into giving him information about the murderer but he receives nothing.</p><p>At the Daily Bugle, Eater appears looking for J. Jonah Jameson and before he could kill Joe Robertson, Peter Parker, who was at the Bugle, knocks him out using the roller of a typewriter. The Eater is unmasked and taken by the police. During the interrogation which is being attended by Daredevil and Spider-Man, the suspect is identified as Emile Gregg who tells his interrogators that he was hearing voices the prompted him to commit the crimes. However, Daredevil, hearing Gregg's heartbeats realizes that Gregg is lying and tells Spider-Man that he may have not committed these crimes and convinces him to search Gregg's apartment. They discover that Gregg's apartment is adjacent to Carter's which contains several Eater costumes and guns. Daredevil deduces that Carter is the real murderer and Gregg, who was obviously mentally unstable, heard Carter recording his own thoughts using a tape recorder they found and thought they were voices in his head. The heroes recall that Eater intended to kill Jameson and is most likely going to Jonah's penthouse where Betty Brant and Marla Jameson are while Jonah is attending a conference in Florida. Indeed, Eater goes to Jonah's penthouse and when he was about to kill Betty, Spider-Man crashes through the window just in time and viciously pummels Eater while Betty watches in horror. Daredevil appears and prevents an enraged Spider-Man from killing the unconscious Carter. However, in his current state of mind, Spider-Man punches Daredevil out of the apartment. Daredevil regains his footing and starts taunting Spider-Man who is easily provoked in his current mindset and goes to fight Daredevil but the Man Without Fear manages manages to defeat Spider-Man who's fighting abilities are diminished by his rage by confusing his spider-sense and beating him to unconsciousness with his billy club.</p><p>Carter is taken into custody and it is revealed that he was driven insane by drugs after his partner was killed. When it is revealed that Carter may be found innocent by insanity, a group of angry civilians, including Jean's father, who were willing to punish Carter for his crimes assaulted the precinct looking for Carter. Daredevil tried to save Carter but he was overwhelmed by the mob and he asked for help from Spider-Man who turned his back and walked away because he though Carter deserved what was about to happen to him. In a desperate attempt to save himself and Carter, Daredevil cried out Spider-Man's real name causing Peter to instinctively swing by and save both Daredevil and Carter. On a rooftop, both Spider-Man and Daredevil reveal each other's secret identities to each other and Matt even offered his legal services to Peter if he needed. This solidified the friendship between the superheroes.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-42927\" href=\"/spider-man-the-death-of-jean-dewolff/4050-42927/\" slug=\"spider-man-the-death-of-jean-dewolff\">Spider-Man: The Death of Jean DeWolff</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-286201\" href=\"/essential-spectacular-spider-man-volume-five/4000-286201/\" slug=\"essential-spectacular-spider-man-volume-five\">Essential Spectacular Spider-Man Vol. 5</a></li></ul>",

Norman has orchestrated the kidnapping of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\" href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" slug=\"aunt-may\">Aunt May</a> in order to solicit Peter's help in breaking him out of prison and if he doesn't May dies.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1582990-spidey___black_cat_22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1582990\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5163636363636\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1582990-spidey___black_cat_22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1582990\"><img alt=\"Spidey and Black Cat fight off the Sinister Twelve\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/1582990-spidey___black_cat_22.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1582990-spidey___black_cat_22.jpg 550w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54400/1582990-spidey___black_cat_22.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Spidey and Black Cat fight off the Sinister Twelve</figcaption></figure><p>Though reluctant, Spider-Man teams-up with the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\" href=\"/black-cat/4005-1479/\" slug=\"black-cat\">Black Cat</a> and successfully break Osborn out of jail.

Spidey and Felicia desperately try to fight back against the villaines but they are overwhelmed by their sheer numbers and Cat is struck down by Electro, much to Vulture's displeasure because he wanted to get her first for what she did to him.

    "description": "<h3>Part One</h3><p>The story begins with <a href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\">Lex Luthor </a>being hung upside-down from a tall building by three mercenaries. It then flashes back as Luthor thinks back to the events of a week ago, when one of his employees was giving a presentation for a sensor used to locate <a href=\"/power-ring/4055-56282/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56282\">Lantern rings</a>. Luthor insists that he wants the sensor's power to be increased, but when the employee attempts to explain why that won't work, Luthor tells his assistant Spalding to fire the employee. In a blind rage, the employee attacks Luthor, scarring his forehead before Luthor's guards intervene. The story then shifts to a day ago, where Luthor is seen having dinner with his <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane </a>robot (which he built from <a href=\"/kryptonians/4060-45710/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45710\">Kryptonian </a>and <a href=\"/brainiac/4005-4684/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4684\">Brainiac </a>technology, along with DNA traces of Lois Lane). In this dinner, Luthor orders a hitman to kill the employee who assaulted him.</p><p>He then continues having a conversation with the Lois robot, stating that her purpose is to offer an opposite viewpoint to challenge him. He goes on to say that his previous exposure to the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/orange-power-ring/4055-55737/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55737\">Orange Ring </a>during the events of <a href=\"/blackest-night/4045-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\">Blackest Night </a>have altered him, making him want everything now. He believes that the Black Lantern rings are the key to him unlocking power and sating his hunger, and that even though they all disintegrated, he believes that they are traces. He then ends the night by sleeping with Lois.</p><p>Luthor then flashes back to the events of a few hours ago, where he meets with Spalding, who tells him that there have still been no traces of a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/black-power-ring/4055-55739/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55739\">Black Lantern ring</a>. Luthor then goes off to use the Isopod - an intelligent listening device that connects one's neurons to all forms of media. Through this, Luthor picks up an article stating that there has been a change in the fabric of the universe, and this gives him an epiphany. That there are traces of Black Lantern ring energy around the universe, and that if he can sample that energy, he can develop his own Black Ring. As he prepares his power armor for the journey, he is suddenly attacked by four mercenaries. Luthor makes the Lois robot intercept them, but even though she succeeds in killing one, the rest are able to make off with Luthor.</p><p>The story then returns to the present, and Luthor notes that his captors are working for someone who is seemingly in mental communication with them, and that they were ordered to hang him upside down. When Luthor asks who their master is, the head of one of the mercenaries bursts open. As Luthor is brought back up to the building's roof, he recognizes the worm that emerges from the mercenary's head - <a href=\"/mr-mind/4005-9336/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9336\">Mr. Mind</a>.</p><h3>Part Two</h3><p>The second part begins with a mental hallucination. Luthor is seen as a caveman living with his family, and he says that we (ordinary humans) work so hard for so little, while those who are born 'rewarded' don't (superhumans). He then climbs up a hill and sneaks into a temple which has three giant statues of a cloaked man (representing <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>), a man with a lightning bolt on his chest (<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman </a>- the bolt being a reference to Zeus), and a woman with a tiara (<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a>). The giant mountain represents Mount Olympus, symbolizing how ordinary humans view superheroes as being Gods, and Luthor sneaks in to steal a bowl of flame symbolizing power (similar to how the Greek Prometheus stole fire from the Gods). As he flees with the flame, he is then attacked by the giant Superman statue, who attacks him with heat-vision. But Luthor is able to trip the statue, shattering it, and he then returns back to the other humans - claiming his victory over those who didn't deserve it.</p><p>The story then shifts to Mr. Mind, who is seemingly talking to an unknown collaborator. Mind tells his mystery master that he's seized control of Luthor's mind, and told it to fantasize in order to distract Luthor. Mind then states that once Luthor has accepted the fantasies, he (Mind) will be able to fiddle with Luthor's brain and make Luthor see anything.</p><p>Back in Luthor's mind, he is suddenly in another fantasy, where he is dressed in a pseudo-Victor Frankenstein style outfit. He is in a mad scientist lab of some sort, and the Lois robot appears, asking him if they are going to 'check what he created'. She indicates to a body covered by a sheet, and Luthor states that he might have made a monster, and that it isn't human and could kill with a look. Luthor mentions that there is something strange about the situation, when Lois says that it could be anyone under that sheet - from Superboy to Superman to herself. Luthor pulls off the sheet, revealing that the creation is actually himself. The Lois robot then tells him that this is what Luthor doesn't want to consider about himself - that he represents humanity and that he works best with others.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Mind reacts in surprise to the fantasy Lois' statement, stating that this is the opposite of what he wanted. He then says that he'll fight back, and in the fantasy, Luthor and Lois are suddenly attacked by townspeople. The rampaging mob take away Lois, and Luthor cries out in rage, saying that they never understand that he's doing everything for their benefit. This could likely symbolize how Luthor truly believes that his attempts to defeat Superman et cetera are actually part of his desire to elevate humanity beyond superheroes.</p><p>The fantasy abruptly changes again, and this time, Luthor is dressed as a sheriff in the Wild West. He stares at a nearby wanted poster with Mr. Mind on it, and realizes that both he and Mr. Mind shouldn't be in the West. A man suddenly approaches him in a hurry, and asks for his help, saying that 'Big Blue' is back in town. By this point, Luthor realizes that this is all a fantasy when the townspeople begin saying things like 'Only you can save us, Sheriff! You're like us, but you're better than us!\". Luthor then approaches Big Blue (a gunslinger dressed in red, blue, and yellow with a Superman-esque appearance), but notes that the flattery displayed by the townspeople is a distraction. He realizes that the people are just projections by Mind, and he shoots one instead of attacking Big Blue.</p><p>Mr. Mind recoils in shock to this, first surprised that Luthor was able to change the fantasy earlier on (from the Frankenstein scenario to the Wild West), and that Luthor is now conscious he is in a fantasy. Mind begins wailing to his mystery master, stating that Luthor will soon find where Mind's brain is connected to the fantasy, and that he has to get out. But his mysterious master refuses to allow Mind to leave the dream.</p><p>Back in the fantasy, Luthor has found where Mind is hiding - inside a saloon. Mister Mind is holding the gagged Lois robot at gunpoint. Luthor then notes that Mind is just stalling (because otherwise why would Mind not shoot Lois - who is obviously just a figment of Luthor's mind), and realizes that Mind is afraid someone will affect them in the real world (where Luthor and Mind are still on the building's roof). Luthor then realizes that he controls the dream, and removes the gag from Lois, who tells him that Mind is trying to change the dream. The fantasy suddenly alters to a giant Mr. Mind in a city.</p><p>Luthor, now in a business suit, notes that the present dream is taken from his childhood fantasy. He says that he knows how this dream goes, and stripping off his shirt, states that 'This is a job for Lex Luthor'. Flying to the air, he begins bashing Mind, noting how Mind's 'heart isn't in it' and that Mind is working for someone else. Mr. Mind refuses to tell, so Luthor takes control of his physical body in the real-world, and kicks Mind off the roof. This results in Mind's connection being severed, and Luthor is suddenly conscious again. The mercenaries who were under Mr. Mind's control beg Luthor for forgiveness, and he tells them to tell him everything they know.</p><p>Later on, in the real world, Luthor is speaking to the Lois robot again, and notes that the messages that the first two fantasies were trying to impart was that he didn't need help from anyone. He then looks at a map of the Black Lantern energy traces and states that they will leave for the first location tomorrow. Luthor goes on to say that if Mind was trying to make him work alone, he feels more inclined to bring along company.</p><p>Luthor then makes a call to <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/deathstroke/4005-3588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3588\">Deathstroke the Terminator</a>.</p><h3>Part Three</h3><p>Luthor and his party (which includes Deathstroke, the Lois robot, his assistant Spalding, helicopter pilot Jessop and guard Finch, along with other armed personnel) arrive at the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Jessop asks Finch who that woman (the Lois robot) with Luthor is, stating that she kept her face covered the entire flight, but Spalding scolds them both - reminding them that they are paid more than their counterparts because of their discretion. (In actuality, the Lois robot covers her face because anyone would recognize world-famous journalist Lois Lane).</p><p>Luthor wonders aloud why Mr. Mind wanted him to be hung upside-down, and Lois suggests that perhaps the increased blood flow helped the caterpillar's hallucination. Luthor goes on to mention that Mind's servants could tell him little, and that Mind must have been working with a being of high power - because Mind himself is a multidimensional psychic entity. The landing party suddenly reaches the source of the Black Lantern energy, a giant sphere of pure black. As they approach it, Deathstroke realizes that the sphere is somehow affecting his emotions. He goes first, noting that he feels scared for no reason, while Luthor analyzes it and states that it's a different kind of spacetime. Spalding then tells Luthor that according to a chronometer, this spacetime hole has been here for billions of years, and Luthor concludes that the Black Ring energy dissipated through time and space, leaving debris like this sphere all across time.</p><p>Suddenly, Deathstroke is overwhelmed by his emotions and charges for Luthor. Before Deathstroke closes the distance, Luthor tells Spalding to sample the Black Lantern energy, and tells his guards to distract Slade. Deathstroke easily dispatches the guards, but Luthor manages to get his power suit on and begins fighting him. Meanwhile, Spalding starts analyzing the sphere of Black Lantern energy, when Jessop is suddenly overcome by emotion and charges for Spalding with a knife. Lois easily dispatches her though. Luthor suddenly feels the effect of the Black Lantern ring when he becomes angry, and realizes that the Black energy is regulated by any emotion. In his fear, he is seized by the energy also, but fights back with his mind.</p><p>But just as Deathstroke is about to kill Luthor, Spalding successfully samples the Black Lantern energy, and the sphere changes into a 'different type of spacetime'. By analyzing it, he essentially altered and mutated it, stopping its effect. Everyone suddenly comes back to their senses, and Deathstroke apologizes for his attempted murder of Luthor. Luthor replies that he'll cut Slade's fee in half.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"/gorilla-grodd/4005-2380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2380\">Gorilla Grodd </a>enters his secure facility and looks at another 'Dark Zone' of energy - just like the one Luthor just encountered.</p><h3>Part Four</h3><p>Luthor and his party (sans Deathstroke) arrive at the next site of Black Lantern energy - Bwindi National Park in Uganda. As they trek through the jungle, they are observed by mind-controlled gorillas who mentally report back to their master - Grodd - that Luthor's party is heading straight for Grodd's base. Grodd, at his base, mentions that he built the base around the Dark Zone and that he hasn't figured out how to safely explore the anomaly - and mentions that Luthor must know what the sphere is. He then enters a room filled with shelves of brains, and selects one belonging to a Mr. Cardington - an employee of Luthor. Grodd eats the brain, absorbing all the knowledge of Luthor's murdered employee.</p><p>Back in the jungle, Luthor tells Lois that if she wasn't here to keep him in line, he would succumb to the need that he feels (as a result of his previous exposure to Orange Lantern energy) and that would lead him to make mistakes. At his base, Grodd states that Cardington's memories suggest Luthor will act rashly if provoked, and as he surveys Luthor, he also says that Luthor has revealed another weakness - his love for the Lois robot. He then orders his gorilla henchmen to attack the party. Lois is snatched away, and they bring her back to Grodd's base. There, Grodd attempts to eat her brain to ingest her knowledge - only to realize that she's an android. Annoyed, he then uses a device to control her android brain, and tells her to inform him of all of Luthor's weaknesses.</p><p>An hour later, Luthor and his party are still tracking Lois, when they are suddenly attacked by an ambush from Gorilla Grodd (who brought along a giant spoon). Luthor then challenges Grodd to a one-on-one match in hand-to-hand, and Grodd spears Luthor's head off with his spoon. Grodd then proceeds to ingest Luthor's decapitated head, when an electric shock from the head abruptly stuns him. It is then revealed that the Luthor from the beginning was simply another android.</p><p>A flashback to four weeks ago reveals that Luthor had ordered Mr. Cardington to go to Bwindi National Park, and that he had implanted various drugs and gave him some 'personal details' about himself. Back in the present, two gorillas inside Grodd's base take off their disguises to reveal that Spalding and Luthor had been masquerading as gorillas from the beginning. Luthor then reveals that the drugs he gave Cardington were meant to affect Grodd's judgment, and that the android's challenge to Grodd was deliberately designed to enrage the gorilla, so that the ape wouldn't prod the android with his mental abilities (thus revealing the ruse). With Grodd out of commission, the other apes in the base go back to being ordinary animals, while the head of the Luthor android begins relaying the base's codes from Grodd's brain to Luthor.</p><p>Using the codes, they enter the room where Grodd has sealed the Dark Zone. There, Spalding begins his analysis, and the sphere is altered as before. Back in the jungle, Grodd awakens and realizes that he's been duped. As Luthor and the rest of his party escape by air, Luthor (who is surveying the jungle through the helicopter's open door) is suddenly shot by Grodd with a sniper laser rifle. Luthor falls back down to the jungle, crashing off some rocks, and seemingly dies.</p><p>The chapter ends with Luthor (implying his spirit) looking over his dead body, when he is suddenly approached by <a href=\"/death-of-the-endless/4005-7280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7280\">Death of the Endless</a>.</p><h3>Part Five</h3><p>Luthor stares at the dead body, stating that he thinks its a duplicate, while Death tells him that they're outside time. Death introduces herself, and when Luthor still doesn't believe her, she touches his nose - and it begins to decompose. The effect stops after a while, and Luthor finally believes her. Death then tells Luthor that she's here to review his life. She then shows him a vision of his life - which includes flashbacks of his father, his discovery of <a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite</a>, him meeting Clark Kent as a boy, the Death of Superman, fights with <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a>, Superman, and Brainiac, as well as his alliance with other villains like the <a href=\"/injustice-league/4060-22672/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22672\">Injustice League</a>. Luthor is enraged by this, saying that he 'did what had to be done'.</p><p>He then asks her about the Blackest Night, implying that she wasn't doing her job, but Death simply replies that she was busy and that occasionally people return to life - but that they all eventually come back to her. Luthor finally changes his approach, and cooling off, begins bargaining with Death - asking her what she wants in return for his life. She jokingly asks for a magic pony that sings. Luthor begins feeling scared, and actually asks her for help - and Death tells him that even though many have asked for her sympathy, it makes no difference. Death tells him that the next phase is acceptance, but Luthor refuses, and in his ego says that there must be some way out of it. Death then brings them to another dimension where they can talk privately.</p><p>Death asks him what he thinks about the afterlife, and Luthor expounds on his views. He says that the only person who can judge him is someone with an objective view on the universe, but states that science claims there is no such view. Luthor goes on to call himself an atheist, believing that believers are declining their responsibilities, and says that choosing to be an atheist is an ethical decision. Luthor then asks Death that if there is a God who judges him - will he have the opportunity to present his case? He then tells her that he knows Hell is real - because he's been there - and when Death tells him he could say sorry, Luthor insists that there is nothing to be sorry for and that he won't grovel.</p><p>Death then goes on to show Luthor some hypotheticals - giving him a vision of his own hedonistic paradise. Luthor replies that these are just distractions, and not what he actually lives for. Death then asks him if he would want to live in brilliant bliss forever, and Luthor replies \"What's the catch?\" - stating that he doesn't believe in it. Luthor then tells her that he bows to no one, and that she should just get it over with. And that no matter what, he'll find a way out.</p><p>But Death suddenly tells him that this is just a preliminary check, and that he isn't even dead. Luthor then awakens in a hospital room, and asks if he was ever clinically dead, to which Spalding replies that he wasn't. Luthor then wonders why one of the principles of the universe - Death - wanted to check up on him, and wonders what awaits him in the future.</p><p>The story ends 1000 years prior, where <a href=\"/vandal-savage/4005-5722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5722\">Vandal Savage </a>is speaking to a soothsayer - who tells him that the 'hanged man will make his presence felt here' (a reference to Luthor being hung upside-down in Part One), and that he doesn't wish Savage well, but that Luthor's meddling will bring great happiness to him. The soothsayer goes on to say that it may be centuries before the prophecy comes to past. Savage then orders his master mason to begin construction of a city built upon two more Black Lantern anomalies. A city that is actually a trap.</p><h3>Part Six</h3><p>In Sapristi Bohemia, 1358, Vandal Savage's city is caught up in riots (as a result of the two spheres) as he makes his yearly inspection of the two Black Lantern anomalies. Throughout the centuries, Luthor has yet to be born, but in the late 20th century, Savage finally recognizes Luthor's face in the Daily Planet. Luthor then tells his daughter <a href=\"/scandal-savage/4005-42304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42304\">Scandal Savage </a>- then only a child - that they must reveal nothing about the prophecy to Luthor, as he has to come upon it by chance. The story then flashes back to previous encounters between Savage and Luthor - once in Flash #124 and another in <a href=\"/salvation-run/4050-20239/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20239\">Salvation Run</a>, where Savage both times tried to convince Luthor to go to his city, but failed.</p><p>Back in the present, at an Australian <a href=\"/lexcorp/4060-51472/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51472\">Lexcorp </a>facility, Luthor is having a dream and awakens, suddenly realizing that there are only ten Black Lantern anomalies, and that changing them all will grant him power. Lois also wakes up, and Luthor explains that the analyses have revealed that these spheres are remnants of Black Lantern energy, storage points for that energy with a connection to another dimension. But that his dream told him that power comes not from investigating them, but by changing them - and so far they have altered two (the first one in Antarctica, and the second one in Uganda). Luthor then states that his visit by Death convinced him that major power will be his soon if cosmic entities are watching him. Luthor then notes that four of the remaining spheres are in space, that two more are 'problematic', and that another two are fairly easy to obtain.</p><p>Luthor then meets with Spalding to launch a satellite with a Black Lantern energy sensor, and says that he plans to alter the spheres from space. In Bohemia, Vandal Savage makes a visit to his spheres and is enraged when he learns that they have been altered. In frustration, he then decides to go directly after Luthor. The next day, at Lexcorp HQ in Metropolis, Savage and his men have seized control of the entire tower just before Luthor and his party returns. Luthor is then ambushed by Savage in the boardroom, where Savage and his men have held Luthor's staff and entire board hostage.</p><p>Savage then tells Luthor that he has placed explosives all across the tower - which would cripple Luthor's business - and Savage demands that Luthor tell him where the rest of the spheres are. Savage believes that these spheres are now the key to his promised happiness. Luthor admits that he's at a disadvantage, and cautiously walks to straighten a crooked portrait of himself on the wall. But secretly, he presses a button beside the portrait's frame, that sends a signal for help to the <a href=\"/secret-six/4060-38149/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-38149\">Secret Six</a>.</p><h3>Part Seven</h3><p>The Secret Six, comprised of Scandal Savage, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/deadshot/4005-5763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5763\">Deadshot</a>, <a href=\"/catman/4005-23247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23247\">Catman</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/bane/4005-6129/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6129\">Bane</a>, <a href=\"/jeannette/4005-59952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59952\">Jeannette</a>, <a href=\"/black-alice/4005-41210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41210\">Black Alice</a>, and <a href=\"/ragdoll/4005-11251/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11251\">Rag Doll </a>infiltrate the LexCorp tower via the ventilation vents. The story flashes back to a few weeks ago, where Luthor meets Scandal at a fancy restaurant. Luthor tells her that he wants the Six as an ace up his sleeve, and makes a mysterious offer that is not revealed. Bane notes that the offer alone makes any risk worth it. But as Scandal peers through the vent, she is shocked to see it is her father Vandal Savage whom she has to save Luthor from. Meanwhile, Luthor continues to stall Vandal Savage.</p><p>Elsewhere, Mr. Mind (who survived his death by downloading a memory clone into a Luthor employee) appears and reboots the Lois robot (who was shut down by a virus used earlier by Savage). Lois asks Mind why Mind helped reboot her, and Mind replies that his mysterious employer's attention is elsewhere now, so he wanted to have a chat. He states that when Lois shot at one of his mind-controlled mercenaries (from Part One), she infected one of them with high-tech nanites that caused them to specifically dangle Luthor upside-down. Mind voices his suspicion that Lois is secretly working for another party, but Lois quickly shuts the body down with an electric shock.</p><p>Back at the Luthor boardroom, Deadshot rushes in and begins firing away, killing members of Vandal's army. Luthor rushes for the detonator in Vandal Savage's hands (that controls the bombs), but it falls away, reflecting off the boardroom table before Scandal catches it. After a quick verbal spat with her father, the entire room is suddenly attacked by Lois, who begins blasting everyone. Scandal is knocked out by the Lois robot, causing Vandal to go berserk, and he then proceeds to slice through the robot with a giant axe. Scandal awakens, but more of Vandal's guards break in and begin firing. Luthor tells Black Alice to channel Zatanna's powers to incapacitate the guards, but they learn to their dismay that the guards are protected by magical defenses. The guards continue shooting, causing the detonator to fly around the room - before it lands on the floor and the button is pressed.</p><h3>Secret Six: What Luthor Has Wrought</h3><p>In this crossover with the Secret Six, the story continues as the detonator fails to detonate because the button has only been partially depressed. Luthor offers a bonus to the Six if they sacrifice themselves, but they refuse. Vandal then goes on to state that it was prophesied that Luthor's manipulation of the Black Lantern energy would bring him unbridled joy. Luthor then opens up a box and eats a piece of gum from it. Vandal then threatens to kill Luthor, as this would give him joy after all of the frustration, but a force-field suddenly forms around Luthor - revealing that the gum was actually another device. Luthor then reveals that he had secret polymer-based turrets aimed at Scandal, and that he specifically chose the Six because he wanted to use Scandal as a human shield.</p><p>He orders Vandal to turn off the detonator, and Savage begrudgingly agrees for the sake of his daughter. But to everyone's dismay, the detonator is stuck, and as the bomb continues counting down - Luthor orders Black Alice to disable the other explosives. She transforms to Dr. Fate and leaves. As twelve seconds remain, Luthor then forces Vandal to admit that Luthor beat him, before opening up his force-field to allow everyone to enter. Along with Vandal, the Secret Six, Lois, and his board members, they survive the resulting explosion and fall out of the building. Black Alice, channeling Alan Scott, saves them from their fall.</p><p>As they all collect themselves, Luthor demands servitude from Vandal, but Vandal refuses - causing Luthor to order Lois to shoot Scandal. Lois, auto-repairing her chopped body, then begins attacking Scandal, but Scandal succeeds in decapitating the robot. Meanwhile, Vandal is holding Luthor in a chokehold, but Scandal convinces her father to let him go - as another dead employer would damage the Six's relationship. Vandal chooses to, and he makes a deal of mutual alliance with Luthor. But suddenly, Scandal punches Luthor and tells him that the Six quit. Bane warns Vandal not to humiliate his daughter ever again.</p><p>As the Six leave and Vandal and Luthor talk, it is revealed that Scandal's mother was a Brazilian woman who tricked Vandal to love her - and then killed herself, knowing that Vandal would be alone forever.</p><h3>Father's Box</h3><p>In this brief interlude, the story flashes back to a young Lex Luthor recently arriving in <a href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis</a>, where he witnesses a man committing suicide as a result of losing his job. Lex enters a bar, where he is approached by a man named 'Petey', who asks him if he wants gum. The two leave the bar, and Luthor easily guesses that 'Petey' is <a href=\"/perry-white/4005-1809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1809\">Perry White</a>, and that he is on an undercover story for the Daily Planet. Perry then warns him that something is going on at this bar, when they are suddenly interrupted by Ty - <a href=\"/bruno-mannheim/4005-12938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12938\">Bruno Mannheim's</a> bodyguard. Lex uses this opportunity to introduce himself, claiming he's an old friend of 'Petey' and that Petey said that Mannheim had a job opening.</p><p>Perry manages to convince Lex to bring him on board, and Bruno is impressed enough by Lex to take him into the business. Six weeks later, Lex asks Ty about a door, but Ty says he doesn't see anything. Lex then enters the door, and it turns out that it is a <a href=\"/boom-tube/4055-41472/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41472\">Boom Tube </a>that leads him to <a href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\">Apokolips</a>. There, he comes face to face with <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a>, <a href=\"/desaad/4005-4681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4681\">Desaad</a>, <a href=\"/granny-goodness/4005-3629/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3629\">Granny Goodness</a>, and the <a href=\"/female-furies/4060-41295/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41295\">Female Furies</a>. Darkseid reveals that he intentionally made the door to only be noticed by Luthor, and he kills a man in front of Luthor. But Luthor doesn't react at all, and when Luthor asks Darkseid why the <a href=\"/new-gods/4060-40647/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40647\">New God </a>is interested in him, Darkseid is finally impressed, and begins to show him Apokolips.</p><p>Darkseid then employs Luthor as his new Scientwister, and he works with <a href=\"/mokkari/4005-13149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13149\">Mokkari</a>. He stays on Apokolips for a period of time, and begins developing a powerful weapon, before presenting it to Darkseid. Darkseid tests it out by attempting to fire the weapon, but Lex has booby-trapped the weapon, causing a massive explosion. Luthor then claims himself as the new king of Apokolips, but is shocked when Darkseid is still alive. Lex manages to escape from <a href=\"/kalibak/4005-4680/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4680\">Kalibak </a>and Darkseid's guards, and he manages to secure a Father Box that sends him back to Earth. Later, he meets with Perry again - who tries to offer him a job - but in his newfound arrogance (he became an industrial genius by using tech he took from Apokolips) he rejects Perry's friendship. Their relationship ends on a bad note.</p><p>Back on Apokolips, Darkseid reveals that he arranged Luthor's escape because he knows that Luthor will distract Metropolis, allowing Mannheim and Desaad's <a href=\"/intergang/4060-41506/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41506\">Intergang </a>to operate in secrecy. He then prophesies that one day in the future, Luthor will 'take the bait set by a God'.</p><p>In the present, Luthor reveals that he's been telling this story to Lois - and notes that he's been receiving the attention of cosmic beings since his younger days.</p><h3>A Father's Box</h3><p>In this annual, the story flashes back to Luthor as a young adult, who is revealed to have been an apprentice under <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/4005-40816/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\">Ra's al Ghul</a>. Ra's al Ghul is shown to trust Luthor with his daughters (because he was too cold to impress them), trust Luthor not to intrigue (because Luthor was plain with his failings), and trust Luthor with his wealth (he was already rich). But Luthor believes that leading the world will save it, not the mass cullings that Ra's al Ghul uses to keep the world's population in check. And secretly, he manages to open a box that Ra's al Ghul explicitly forbade him from opening, and reads the forbidden book within.</p><p>But Ra's al Ghul catches him in the act, and kills Luthor for it. But he resurrects Luthor with a <a href=\"/lazarus-pit/4055-40817/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40817\">Lazarus Pit</a>, and while Luthor lives, Ra's al Ghul has already left.</p><h3>Part Eight</h3><p>The story continues as Luthor and Lois arrive in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum </a>by limousine - and Luthor is reading an article about Bruce Wayne launching <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batman-inc/4060-57839/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57839\">Batman Incorporated</a>, and he expresses disgust at it. As they arrive at the Asylum, Spalding tries to tell Luthor that he believes the articles that led Luthor to his quest might have been planted. But Lois tells him to do it later, as Luthor needs all of his concentration now. Luthor then enters the cell that holds another Black Lantern sphere, and the infamous clown prince of crime - <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a>.</p><p>But there is no sphere inside the room, despite the sensors indicating that there is. Only the Joker is present, with two up-turned jars on his table. After aggravating Luthor with some jokes, Joker finally concedes and tells him that they can make a bargain. Lex asks him three questions: how can a large sphere fit inside a cell, why can't he see it, and why does it happen to be in here with the Joker. The Joker replies with three riddles, asking 'how long is a piece of string', 'when is a door not a door', and 'why did the hypnotist have a fork stuck to his head'. Luthor easily deciphers all three riddles, revealing that the sphere can be any size (riddle one), that it was attracted by Joker's magnetic personality (riddle three), and that the sphere is in a jar (ajar, the answer to riddle two).</p><p>Joker then tells Luthor to pick one of the jars on the table, and when Joker reveals Luthor's choice, it turns out to be a singing pony toy. Luthor recoils in shock at this, asking Joker how he overheard Luthor's conversation with Death. Joker opens up the second jar, revealing the black sphere, and he mentions how its presence is hurting something. Joker then says that he was able to overhear Luthor's talk with Death because his negative emotions attract things like the black spheres. He then says that he's immune to its effects, and states that its a keyhole to a dimension that allowed Joker to overhear Luthor's conversation. Joker then mentions that there's a god in that other dimension, and that him overhearing the conversation was just a side effect of the god's machinations.</p><p>Luthor then asks Joker what he wants in exchange, and Joker replies that he wants the sphere to be altered. Spalding complies, and during the change, Joker ovehears another conversation that he doesn't want Luthor to hear. Joker then warns Luthor, telling him that if he makes the wrong choice - he will crack. As Luthor leaves, Lois abruptly pushes Spalding into the sphere, killing him.</p><p>Elsewhere, in the Linden Tree Casino at Las Vegas, one security guard tells another that there's someone in the computer core. The two find a hole leading into the core, where they find <a href=\"/larfleeze/4005-58504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58504\">Larfleeze </a>sitting on a pile of accumulated trash. Larfleeze asks them where he can find Luthor.</p><h3>Part Nine</h3><p>Luthor is preparing to launch his space probe to alter the spheres in space remotely. His guard Finch tells him that the detectors have indicated that the four remaining spheres in space have moved to the same galactic coordinates - while the last one on Earth is moving wildly. Elsewhere on the base, Lois is telepathically communicating with her mystery master - revealing that she's kept Luthor ignorant about the truth of the Black Lantern energy. Abruptly, she gets a warning signal from a monitor - telling her that there is an object inbound for Luthor.</p><p>Outside, Luthor looks up and fires up his force-field just as Larfleeze and his Orange Lantern Corps attacks him. He fights briefly with Larfleeze, before noticing that <a href=\"/glomulus/4005-61813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61813\">Glomulus </a>has kept the last Black sphere on Earth inside his stomach. Larfleeze then demands that Luthor tell him how the sphere works, and Larfleeze correctly suspects that they are a step to Luthor gaining power. But then Luthor attacks him, trying to steal back the Orange Lantern power, but Larfleeze easily overpowers him. Luthor gives a signal to Lois to retrieve something from a lab, when Larfleeze seizes Finch as a hostage.</p><p>Larfleeze threatens to kill Finch - believing that humans value one another - but Luthor kills Finch himself with zero hesitation. In shock, Larfleeze retaliates, but Lois has brought the item from the lab, and opens it up to reveal the altered sphere from Arkham. Luthor then tells Larfleeze that the power he's gaining will be even stronger than the Orange Lantern ring, and proceeds to push Larfleeze into the altered sphere. Luthor then quickly orders Lois to alter the sphere inside Glomulus (she has had a sphere examintion device installed into her since Spalding's death), and it changes as Glomulus evaporates. Lois proceeds to suggest that they change the spheres in space remotely as planned, but Luthor changes his mind - stating that he wants to see what's really going on up there for himself.</p><p>In the Ross Ice Shelf, Larfleeze emerges from the sphere (from Part One), and fires frantically at whatever being he just escaped from. Larfleeze then realizes, for the first time, that he doesn't want that power, and he flies away in fear.</p><p>Back on Earth, Luthor's ship has departed for outer space. Lois continues to communicate with her secret master, telling him that they're on their way to the spheres as planned, and it is revealed that her benefactor is none other than Brainiac himself.</p><h3>Part Ten</h3><p>Luthor and Lois arrive at the coordinates for the four Black spheres in space, and he reacts in shock when Brainiac arrives with his ship - revealing that he instrumented Luthor's entire quest for his purposes. Brainiac then tells Luthor that when Luthor used Brainiac's technology to build the Lois robot, it gave the opportunity for Brainiac to watch and manipulate him, revealing that Lois has been following his commands. Brainiac also proceeds to reveal that Lois (while tending to Luthor's head bruise) introduced a colony of viral nanites into Luthor's brain, which entered his brain via a rush to his head (which was why he was hung upside-down). The nanites made Luthor stay on course, and gave him the dream that he needed to change the spheres rather than study them.</p><p>Brainiac concludes by saying that this was his plan - that Luthor would assume all the risks to collect the Earth spheres, while Brainiac safely collected the ones in space. Lois attempts to apologize to Luthor for this betrayal, but Luthor suddenly breaks into laughter. Luthor then reveals that he's been aware of Brainiac's interference since he realized that the Lois robot had far stronger emotions than he had programmed. He goes on to say that he got a look at her internal workings when Savage chopped the Lois robot in half, and that confirmed his suspicions.</p><p>Luthor then reveals that he's taken steps to distract Superman while he's altering the spheres. And then he shows his trump card - that he has already installed a sphere examination device in his power armor, negating the need for Lois. Luthor then says that this is his quest - and that Brainiac simply tried to steal it, and he then proceeds to fight Brainiac. After a brief fight, Luthor's viral systems activate, infecting Brainiac and paralyzing the alien (this works because Luthor had the opportunity to study Brainiac's systems earlier when he built Lois). He then twists Brainiac's neck, temporarily incapacitating him.</p><p>Luthor then tells Lois that he forgives her, and he proceeds to alter the last four spheres. The remaining six spheres from Earth (the Ross Ice Shelf one, the two at Luthor's base, two at Bohemia, and one in Uganda) fly into space to meet the rest, and they all combine to open up a portal to another dimension. From this portal emerges a colossal demonic-like entity - the <a href=\"/phantom-zone-god/4005-77239/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77239\">Zone Child</a>.</p><p>Suddenly, Mr. Mind appears and reveals that he has been working for this entity since the beginning. Mind confirms Luthor's suspicions that the entity is from the <a href=\"/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\">Phantom Zone</a>, and that it could feel the negative emotions of our universe hurting it. Mind explains that this entity reached out to him and threatened him, to use him as a pawn. And he goes on to explain that the Phantom Zone entity created the spheres out of Black Lantern energy to contain the negative emotions and to create a door. A door into our universe so it could end all life, thus ending its pain. But the entity needed someone to open the door - hence why it used Mind to orchestrate Luthor's quest.</p><p>Mind goes on to reveal that it was the Zone entity that made him drop scientific clues - thus meaning that it was Mind who sent Luthor on his quest in the first place. The Zone Child then begins using its power to end all emotion in the universe by ending all life.</p><p>But Luthor reveals that he has planned for it. He then asks why the entity made Luthor and Mind fight in Luthor's brain, just to prevent Luthor from following Brainiac's nanites suggestion that he should bring Lois along? Luthor deduces that the Zone Child is somehow afraid of Lois, and he slams a hand into her face, using the Brainiac nanites to connect to the Kryptonian technology inside the Lois robot. Kryptonians are able to manipulate the Phantom Zone, and through this, Luthor successfully merges with the entity, resulting in him becoming a god-level being of supreme power.</p><h3>Part Eleven (Finale)</h3><p>In Metropolis, Superman flies into the scene of a crisis and the real Lois tells him that the city was attacked by Doomsday, who defeated Steel and vanished with the hero. In outer space, Luthor feels his power extending across the universe, and using his new-found powers, instantly teleports Superman from Earth to where he is. Luthor tells him that he is behind <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doomsday/4005-9989/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9989\">Doomsday</a>, and Superman realizes that he's suffused with Phantom Zone radiation. Superman guesses that there's a portal to the Phantom Zone nearby, and quickly flies for it in an attempt to save his foster son <a href=\"/christopher-kent/4005-42372/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42372\">Chris Kent</a>, but he's stopped by Luthor. Luthor then explains that he merged with the alien entity who evolved in the Phantom Zone, and that the Zone Child sensed emphatically and that it was hurt by emotions. He goes on to say that the entity preyed on the other Phantom Zone criminals because of their negative emotions, and that it has come to this universe to eradicate all negative emotion at the source.</p><p>Luthor then says that he saved the universe by merging with the Zone Child, and he continues to belittle Superman - claiming that Superman still can't imagine that a human has risen over him. He goes on to monologue - saying that Superman has held back the human race and that it was him who forced Luthor to do terrible things. Luthor claims that Superman doesn't feel as ordinary humans do, and uses his power to show Superman human pain. He begins with the day Superman died at Doomsday's hands, and shows Lois' grief. Next he shows the destruction of <a href=\"/krypton/4020-30670/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-30670\">Krypton</a>, and then Chris Kent sacrificing himself to the Phantom Zone. He then makes Superman experience the death of <a href=\"/new-krypton/4020-56084/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56084\">New Krypton</a>, and Superman is overwhelmed by negative emotion. But Superman refuses to give in, and tells Luthor to look into his mind, to see that Superman truly does feel pain.</p><p>Luthor complies, believing it'll be some cosmic spectacle, but instead sees Superman hugging his mother and dying father in the fallout of <a href=\"/superman-brainiac/4050-38665/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38665\">Superman: Brainiac</a>. Luthor is shocked to learn that Superman is actually Clark Kent, and he rages at Superman - telling him that he's not human and doesn't deserve to be Clark Kent, and he asks Superman why he won't break. Superman replies that his parents made him Clark Kent, so that Clark Kent could later make Superman. Superman vows he won't break, and in a fury, Luthor fries Superman with his power.</p><p>But Superman is still alive, and when Luthor is shocked that his power didn't disintegrate him, Mr. Mind (now possessing the Lois robot) tells him that the Zone Child inside him is fighting back - and the Child proceeds to change the nature of his powers. This causes a wave of bliss to extend across the entire universe, for entropy to stop. We see Death talking to a skier who is near-death and commenting that she has her first day off, Vandal Savage experiencing happiness as per the prophecy, Thanagarians and the Red Lantern Corps in bliss, as are Batman, the Daily Planet, Larfleeze, Deathstroke, Grodd, and even Brainiac.</p><p>Superman then tells Lex that he can make everyone happy forever, that he can use his powers to end the problems of the universe, and that he can be the hero he always wanted to be. Mind tells Luthor that if he wants to keep his power, he can't do anything negative - because that's how the Child changed the powers with its dying breath. But Luthor reacts in pure anger as he realizes that he can do anything except destroy Superman (referring to his earlier conversation with Death about there being a 'catch' to eternal happiness) and rejects his power. Blasting at Superman in an attempt to kill him before the power leaves, Luthor tries but fails and Superman eventually defeats him.</p><p>As the power leaves Luthor, he has forgotten his memories of the power he had before, and doesn't seem to even remember his name. The portal to the Phantom Zone has vanished, returning to ten different Black spheres. Luthor drifts into one of these spheres, and they all vanish from existence. In Arkham, Joker rejoices that Luthor made the right choice, and that Luthor played the greatest sick joke on the universe - and on himself.</p><p>Back in space, the Lois robot (Mind has left the body) is still alive, and Superman asks her if she wants a ride back to Earth on Luthor's spaceship. But the robot expresses sadness that Lex just discarded her despite everything, but she states that she is finally free and that she wants to find her own way. She leaves, and Superman doesn't recognize her likeness because her face was crushed earlier by Luthor.</p><p>Elsewhere in the universe, a remnant of the Zone Child drifts in space.</p><h3>Collected Editions</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/superman-the-black-ring-volume-one/4000-267626/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-267626\">Superman: Black Ring Volume 1</a></li><li><a href=\"/superman-the-black-ring-volume-two/4000-292577/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292577\">Superman: Black Ring Volume 2</a></li></ul>",

With him, comes mystery of why he has been gone so long and who James Jr. truly is. While Jim doesn't know what to think, his daughter, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\" href=\"/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/\" slug=\"barbara-gordon\">Barbara</a>,does, claiming her brother is a monster.

The people of Metropolis are in shock, with a sizable amount doubting whether the Superman that returned is the real Superman or another impostor.

As word gets out, more and more people become distrustful of Superman. Superman, meanwhile, begins to get on edge; he spends extra time trying to prove to people that he is the real deal, and he has no concrete leads as to where the corpse came from. At wits end, Superman starts a witch hunt, going after villains that have the possibility to create this ruse. <br/>Â <br/>Superman first targets the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5377\" href=\"/eradicator/4005-5377/\" slug=\"eradicator\">                     Eradicator</a>, and come into conflict with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-5704\" href=\"/outsiders/4060-5704/\" slug=\"outsiders\">                    Outsiders</a>. While Superman is on his witch hunt, Emil Hamilton confirms that the live Supermanâs DNA has a discrepancy, making the search more urgent.

Supermanâs willpower starts to crumble, until Brainiac tries to kill Lois Lane. Emil Hamilton creates a device that allows Superman to snap out of it, and Superman attacks Brainiac directly. Superman eventually breaks through Brainiacâs mental defenses, convincing Brainiac that he is nothing more than Milton Fine, a shuckster. The Milton Fine personality takes over Brainiac, allowing the S.C.U. to convince Fine to imprison himself. With Brainiac defeated, all trace of the supplicate Superman disappears, having been an illusion in everyoneâs head.",

    "deck": "The man who took the mantle of Captain America during the 1950's has returned and is leading a terrorist group called the Watchdogs to \"reclaim\" America and plans to blow up the Hoover Dam. The current Captain America Bucky and the Falcon team-up to stop him before anyone gets hurt.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2>\"Two Americas\" is a four part story arc that deals with the return of the former Grand Director, the crazed Captain America from the 50's who is leading the terrorist group called the Watchdogs in the hopes of \"reclaiming\" America, as they see that their country has lost its glory. The current Captain America, Bucky Barnes, under the orders of Nicky Fury, teams up with his partner Sam Wilson aka the Falcon to stop this \"Bad Cap\" before anyone is hurt. Bucky infiltrates the Watchdogs' camp, posing as one of their own but his plan backfires and he and Sam are captured as a result. The fiendish Cap forces Bucky to wear his old \"Bucky\" costume as they appear on live television, making a statement by blowing up the Hoover Dam using the vibranium the Watchdogs have takenÂ from Falcon's suit. Meanwhile, Falcon is being kept at a train headed for a lobbyist conference as a distraction from the group's main plan. Sam escapes from his captors and goes to the Hoover Dam to help Bucky who is engaging the rogue Super-Soldier in combat. However, the desperate wannabe patriot attempts to kill everyone using the bomb, because he's rather die than leave his country in its current state, forcing Bucky to shoot and apparently kill him but his body that was dropped off the dam was never found. Despite everything, Bucky still feels sorry for him because he started out with the best intentions and deep down there was good man trying to do the right thing, and killing him has become a heavy burden on his shoulders.

He appears to be working with the Watchdogs as he tells them to head back to the compound and prepare to \"reclaim\" America.Â <br/>This man is revealed to be the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14492\" href=\"/grand-director/4005-14492/\" slug=\"grand-director\">Captain America from the 1950's</a> who idolized the original Captain during WWII to the point of changing everything to become Captain America himself but through out the years became mentally unstable. While trying to reconnect with his beginnings in his birthplace of Boise Idaho, he becomes distraught and enraged at the current state of America and wondpers what happened to his country. He remembered an America that had the best schools and the best workers, a great country but now it is full of empty houses, closed factories and lines of unemployment. When he saw that the house he grew up in had been torn down and in its place now stood an out-of-business strip-mall, the insanity he was constantly fighting off took the best of him and he decided to act. The next day, after he stopped a bank robbery while wearing his Captain America costume, he was noticed by members of the Watchdogs. 50's Cap saw them as honest, hard-workingÂ AmericansÂ who shared the same view of the current America and he gladly became their leader.Â <br/>Â <br/>Two days after the attack on the deputies in Idaho, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\" href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" slug=\"nick-fury\">Nick Fury</a> called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\" href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" slug=\"bucky-barnes\">James \"Bucky\" Barnes</a> down to one of his many secret bases where, after performing upgrades on Bucky's cybernetic arm, making it look and feel like a real arm, shows the current Captain America footage of the 50's Cap giving a speech to the Watchdogs. Bucky immediately recognizes him from an encounter last year and Fury tells him that this man needs to be stopped before coming to the attention of Norman Osborn or any other malicious individual. Even though <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Steve Rogers</a> is back, Bucky volunteered to stop him because heÂ preferredÂ Steve doesn't see his dark reflection with the enemy and considered 50's Cap's re-emergence as his responsibility because he let him escape once before.Â <br/>Â <br/>Bucky and Sam Wilson aka the<a data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\" href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" slug=\"falcon\"> Falcon </a>travel together to Idaho. Sam reminds Bucky that this Cap is even stronger than Steve himself and to make matters worse he is seriously insane. Bucky admits that despite everything, he feels a bit sorry for him but Falcon urges him not to hesitate at all because this Cap is extremely dangerous. While witnessing an Anti-Tax protest, Bucky reveals his plan to infiltrate the Watchdogs's base. At a bar, Sam poses as a \"tax-man\" attempting to close down the bar but Bucky, posing as a truck driver punches him and throws him out of the bar, in the hopes of coming to the Watchdogs' attention. He is successful, as two members of the paramilitary group were impressed by his actions and offered him a spot on their group, just as Bucky had hoped.Â Â <br/>Â <br/>That night, the Watchdogs inform their leader of Â their new recruit, and upon seeing Bucky's picture immediately recognizes him. Â Bucky spends a week in the Watchdogs' training camp and he is put through their basic training in combat skills, weapons and wilderness survival. Knowing who the new recruit really is, the Watchdogs realize that he is holding back and fear that there might be a big risk in bringing him to the compound but the 50's Cap is willing to take that risk and re-assures them that Bucky is part of the plan now.Â Â <br/>Â <br/>Ten miles outside Boise, Captain America and Falcon intercept a Watchdogs scouting mission and make short work of the soldiers. Despite knowing that his cover may be blown, Bucky is still going into the Watchdogs' camp to find out their plan.Â Â <br/>After spending the next day training in the Watchdogs' camp, Bucky sneaks into the rogue Cap's tent at night and attacks him only to discover that a decoy was in his place as Bad Cap had somewhere else to be while the Watchdogs captured Bucky.Â <br/>The fiendish Cap and a group of his soldiers attack Sam in the hotel he is staying at. Falcon is easily outmatched by the Super-Soldier and is viciously knocked out. He reveals that they really came after the vibranium that powers his suit but capturing Falcon is just a bonus. The Watchdogs's scientist removes the entire holographic-wing system and extracts the vibranium to use it as a very powerful explosive.Â <br/>Â <br/>Back at the Watchdog Compound, Bucky attempts to convince Cap of the Watchdogs' terroristic nature but this only angers the rogue Cap who exclaims that the Watchdogs are patriots and after threatening to kill Falcon, forces James to wear his old Bucky costume.Â Â <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1170126-50_s_cap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1170126\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0547588005215\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1170126-50_s_cap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1170126\"><img alt=\"Â The start of a Revolution\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1170126-50_s_cap.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1170126-50_s_cap.jpg 767w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1170126-50_s_cap.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Â The start of a Revolution</figcaption></figure>     The Falcon wakes up in a moving train where he is being held prisoner by the Watchdogs. After Falcon provoked one of the guards, Redwing appeared and gave Falcon the chance to take out the two guards around him and release himself from his restraints. Now free, Sam prepares to take on the whole train full of Watchdogs and after his sneak attack fails, he decides to directly take on all the soldiers. Despite being greatly outnumbered, FalconÂ benefitingÂ from hisÂ formidableÂ hand-to-hand skills, moving fast and striking with precision has the advantage and while they're overconfident because of their numbers and weapons, he catches them in their own crossfire as they stumble over each other. During the fight, Sam enters a room full of explosives so the goons stop shooting at him and tend to the use of melee weapons but Sam easily defeats them. He then enters the driver's room and defeats the remaining Watchdog and meets David Price, the engineer, who tells Sam that the train is meant to crash into corporate lobbyist conference at a train station in Vegas. He also tells him that the trains' brakes are gone and this whole thing is a distraction for something even bigger.Â Meanwhile, Bucky, 50's Cap and the rest of the Watchdogs have traveled via plane to the Hoover Dam and to Bucky's horror, Cap plans on blowing up the dam using the vibranium they took from the Falcon as a statement that will be heard around the world and the start of a revolution.Â <br/>Â <br/>Â After the Watchdogs take out the dam's guards, Cap receives word that all communication with the train has been lost, and now re-assured of Sam's safety, Bucky breaks free from his restraints using his bionic arm that the villains are unaware of and punches an unsuspecting Bad Cap in the face. Sam and DaveÂ separateÂ the section of the train they are in from the one that contains all the otherÂ unconsciousÂ Watchdogs and Sam proceeds to force the last remaining soldier to call in theÂ chopper that was meant to pick them up in the first place before throwing him off the train. Sam and Dave hitch theÂ helicopter, throws the pilot off and, now knowing Bad Cap's plan, goes to the Hoover Dam to help Bucky.Â Â <br/>Â <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1202082-capa605_int_lr_0005_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202082\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.517571884984\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1202082-capa605_int_lr_0005_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202082\"><img alt=\"Bucky vs Captain Unamerica\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52045/1202082-capa605_int_lr_0005_02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1202082-capa605_int_lr_0005_02.jpg 626w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52045/1202082-capa605_int_lr_0005_02.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bucky vs Captain Unamerica\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52045/1202082-capa605_int_lr_0005_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1202082-capa605_int_lr_0005_02.jpg 626w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52045/1202082-capa605_int_lr_0005_02.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bucky vs Captain Unamerica</figcaption></figure>     At the Hoover Dam, an enraged 50's Cap attacks Bucky and tells his soldiers to leave Bucky for him. Bucky gains theÂ upper handÂ using his speedÂ and throughout the fight, Bucky thinks to himself that despite all that's happening, this man is a patriot at heart, willing to fight for what's right but the chemicals that turned him into a Super-Soldier made him crazy. When the rogue Captain America threw his shield at Bucky, the current Cap countered by catching the shield and throwing it at the scientist before he could set up the bomb, knocking him out. Â 50's Cap retaliates by punching James in the face knocking him down but then the Falcon appeared and gave Bucky the chance to fight back. As Falcon fights off the remaining Watchdogs, Bucky and Captain Unamerica continue to fight until the rogue Super-Soldier desperately attempts to set the device off and kill everyone. Bucky picks up a rifle, pointing it at the Captain and tells him that there are doctors that can fix him but Bad Cap, refusing to see this world any differently than he already does, attempts to trigger the bomb so Bucky is forced to brutally shoot him in the chest, killing him and his body is thrown off the dam. Later on, the body is not found but Bucky is certain that the Bad Cap is dead because he never misses. Falcon tells Bucky that he only did what he had to do but Bucky still feels sorry for the wannabe patriot because he wore the uniform and it destroyed him. Falcon replies \"That man was not like you. Remember That.\" Â ",

The heroes, though inexperienced, bonded together thanks to the coordination of Triumph. They eventually found themselves working well together, but when it came to dispatching the Plasma Men, the heroes realized that they must sacrifice one of their own. Superman volunteered, but Triumph beat him to it, sacrificing himself and trapping both he and the Plasma Men within time. <br/>Â <br/>With the disintegration of time caused by <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40782\" href=\"/zero-hour/4045-40782/\" slug=\"zero-hour\">                 Zero Hour</a>, Triumph found himself freed from his prison in time.

At first, Triumph and the heroes try to defeat the Plasma Men using brute force. But that does not seem to work. Triumph starts to use the intelligence that helped him to defeat the Plasma Men the first time. Triumph realizes that the Plasma Men do not realize that humanity is sentient. He figures out a way to communicate with the aliens, and convinces them to leave Earth. Impressed, Martian Manhunter invites Triumph to join the Justice League, hoping that the two can rebuild the team. <br/>Â <br/><h2>Creation </h2>Return of the Hero was a three-part story arc that took place in the pages of the <i>Justice League</i> books during the bigger Zero Hour crossover event.

Peter is forced to save his roommate while using the costume and alias of Daredevil because Ana forced Vin to wear the Spider-Man costume.",
    "description": "<p>While Spider-Man and Daredevil were teaming-up to fight the bank robber Fracture, the mysterious Ana Kravinoff, the daughter of the deceased Kraven the Hunter watches and studies her prey, being Spider-Man. She plans to weaken Spider-Man by attacking those close to him and she brings a file on Peter Parker.</p><p>While applying to work for a comic book store, Peter is targeted by a sniper wielding Ana but manages to save himself and another employee using his abilities and escapes to a subway station. To maintain the secrecy of his identity as Spider-Man, Peter convinces the employee that he is a Skrull shape-shifter and intimidates him into staying quiet about what Peter just did.</p><p>A drug dealer was shot and killed with a gun owned by Peter's roommate, police officer Vin Gonzales who claims that he's innocent and that the gun was somehow taken and used in the killing but since he can't prove his innocence, he is suspended. To make matters worse, while making his way back home, he becomes the victim of a hit and run. While opening up to his friends Peter and Harry, he reveals that his identity and money have been stolen.</p><p>When Vin arrives home, he is attacked by Ana who forces him to wear a Spider-Man costume she found in the apartment, claiming it to be his \"uniform\". After Vin wears the costume, Ana knocks him out by hitting him with her gun to the back of his head and then proceeds to take Vin to a sewer where she ties him up upside down and tells him that she's going to kill him.</p><p>Vin tries to tell her that she has the wrong guy but she only admonishes him for being a weakling and not putting up much of a fight.</p><p>At home, Peter realizes that his costume and web-shooters are missing and calls Matt Murdock for a favor. He goes to Matt's office with a webbed up face to prove that he's Spider-Man without compromising his secret identity and asks him to borrow his Daredevil costume. Meanwhile, Ana injects Vin with a syringe containing Mutant Growth Hormone (MGH).</p><p>As Daredevil, Peter goes to the police station where, he discovers that a girl has been getting MGH with powers similar to Spider-Man's.</p><p>At the sewers, the villain known as Vermin, upset about the intrusion of his home, attacks Ana, giving Vin the chance to escape but Ana defeats Vermin and re-captures Vin. Vermin escapes the sewers and runs into \"Daredevil\" and they have a brutal fight.</p><p>Ana releases Vin from his restraints to enjoy the thrill of hunting and recapturing him.</p><p>During the fight, an enraged Peter brutally pummels Vermin until he manages to stop himself and web him up. Vermin is confused because he saw Spider-Man in the sewers so Peter assumes that Vin may be there wearing his costume and tells Vermin to lead him there.</p><p>While hiding from Ana, Vin attempts to fight her but he is easily defeated and before she could finish him off, Peter appears and fights her. To maintain his identity as Daredevil, Peter throws Vin a web-shooter and following Peter's instructions, Vin webs Ana up but she manages to break free and continues to fight Vin and Peter who doesn't use the other web-shooter to maintain the ruse of being Daredevil. Vermin then shows up with a horde of rats and attacks Ana, giving Peter and Vin the chance to escape.</p><p>Vin is taken to a hospital where he recovers and is glad that \"Daredevil\" saved him. His suspension has been lifted and it is obvious to everyone that he isn't Spider-Man. Peter, as Spider-Man visits him and tells him that he placed his costume in Vin's apartment as part of a \"decoy plan\" to prevent anyone from knowing his secret identity. An enraged Vin punches Spider-Man in the face and tells him to leave, calling him a lowlife dirt bag.</p><p>Ana returns to her home where she is consoled by her mother, Sasha Kravinoff, who claims that things are far from over with Spider-Man.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/spider-man-kravens-first-hunt-spider-man-kravens-first-hunt/4000-198663/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-198663\">Spider-Man: Kraven's First Hunt</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-297087/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-297087\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #10</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-astonishing-spider-man-11/4000-297088/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-297088\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #11</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-astonishing-spider-man-12/4000-297089/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-297089\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #12</a></li></ul>",

While traveling the limbo between worlds, Per Degaton noticed an emerald prison. Upon closer inspection, Degaton discovered the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41531\" href=\"/crime-syndicate-of-amerika/4060-41531/\" slug=\"crime-syndicate-of-amerika\">                    Crime Syndicate</a> of Earth-3, imprisoned by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\" href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" slug=\"hal-jordan\">                   Green Lantern</a> after their most recent fight with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">                  Justice League</a> and Justice Society. Per Degaton freed them, and enlisted them in his plans for revenge. Degaton picked the perfect time to strike: during the annual meeting between the JLA and the JSA. <br/>Â <br/>Once every year, the JSA transported to the JLAâs base of Earth-1 (or vice-versa) to meet. This time, however, the JLA (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\" href=\"/aquaman/4005-2357/\" slug=\"aquaman\">                 Aquaman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2353\" href=\"/firestorm/4005-2353/\" slug=\"firestorm\">                Firestorm</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8337\" href=\"/hawkman/4005-8337/\" slug=\"hawkman\">               Hawkman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">              Superman</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\" href=\"/zatanna/4005-5691/\" slug=\"zatanna\">             Zatanna</a>) did not receive the guests they expected. Instead of the JSA, they encountered the Crime Syndicate. While the JLA and the Crime Syndicate fought on the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55849\" href=\"/justice-league-satellite/4020-55849/\" slug=\"justice-league-satellite\">            Justice League Satellite</a>, the JSA found themselves transported to another world, Earth-Prime. However, unlike the normal Earth-Prime they anticipated, they found themselves in a nuclear holocaust. <br/>Â <br/>Prior to freeing the Crime Syndicate, Per Degaton had discovered Earth-Prime. He and the Crime Syndicate returned there, to its year 1962. Once there, Degaton made use of the Cuban Missile Crisis to not only steal a ton of nuclear weapons, but to also bring the crisis to its head. The resultant nuclear war between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. destroyed the planet. Now, the Justice Society (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-6599\" href=\"/doctor-fate-kent-nelson/4005-6599/\" slug=\"doctor-fate-kent-nelson\">           Doctor Fate</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12663\" href=\"/alan-scott/4005-12663/\" slug=\"alan-scott\">          Green Lantern</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45563\" href=\"/helena-wayne/4005-45563/\" slug=\"helena-wayne\">         Huntress</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4915\" href=\"/power-girl/4005-4915/\" slug=\"power-girl\">        Power Girl</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9296\" href=\"/starman-ted-knight/4005-9296/\" slug=\"starman-ted-knight\">       Starman</a>) found themselves trapped on a post-apocalyptic world, filled with mutated threats. The Justice League is temporarily defeated by the Crime Syndicate, who flee the JLA Satellite in a space shuttle. The JLA do not pursue, but rather head to Earth-2 to find the whereabouts of the missing Justice Society. They travel to Earth-2 to find the world has been conquered by Per Degaton. <br/>Â <br/>The JLA discover that Per Degaton and the Crime Syndicate had taken the stolen Cuban Missile Crisis missiles back to 1942, where he used them to blackmail the world and take control, thereby altering history. The Justice League travel back to Earth-2âs 1942, where they encounter the All-Star Squadron (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-23481\" href=\"/commander-steel/4005-23481/\" slug=\"commander-steel\">      Commander Steel</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-66975\" href=\"/firebrand-danette-reilly/4005-66975/\" slug=\"firebrand-danette-reilly\">     Firebrand</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-36717\" href=\"/johnny-quick/4005-36717/\" slug=\"johnny-quick\">    Johnny Quick</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32525\" href=\"/libby-lawrence/4005-32525/\" slug=\"libby-lawrence\">   Liberty Belle</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4079\" href=\"/robotman/4005-4079/\" slug=\"robotman\">  Robotman</a>). The heroes compare notes, and are soon witness to Per Degatonâs threats: unless the nations of the world surrender to his rule, Per Degaton will detonate the atomic bombs he has stolen from 1962. Degaton promises a show of force by detonating one of the bombs, and the heroes rush to prevent his plan from happening. <br/>Â <br/>Back on the post-apocalyptic Earth-Prime, the JSA realize what has happened in its past. Doctor Fateâs magic reveals that Per Degaton is behind the destruction of Earth-Prime, and they follow his path to Earth-2âs 1942 to stop him with the stolen missiles. The JSA appear alongside the JLA and the All-Star Squadron, but the heroes are too late to stop Degaton from exploding one of the nuclear missiles. <br/>Â <br/>The three teams use their powers to find multiple locations where Per Degaton has planted the missiles. They split up into teams, but finds each site is guarded by a member of the Crime Syndicate. The heroes, though, outnumber each Crime Syndicate member three-to-one, and defeat each Syndicate member. The heroes close in on Degaton, and, with the missiles destroyed, stop him from carrying out his threat. Zatanna, Green Lantern, and Firebrand travel to 1962 on Earth-Prime, and prevent Per Degaton and the Crime Syndicate from stealing the missiles to begin with. This prevents Per Degaton from carrying out any of his plans, and Zatanna and Green Lantern use their combined powers to return Degaton to his past with no memory of his plans. With history now rewritten, each hero and villain returns to their original place in time and space, not even aware that this event happened.Â ",

The Crusader claims the city is drenched in sin, deserving of God's wrath, to which Azrael agrees. In between the Angels of Death and the destruction of Gotham City stand <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\" href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" slug=\"dick-grayson\">Dick Grayson</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\" href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" slug=\"tim-drake\">Tim Drake</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1698\" href=\"/catwoman/4005-1698/\" slug=\"catwoman\">Selina Kyle</a>. The Crusader suggests that the three heroes were summoned there by god, and Azrael believes that they should be tested individually to see if there is one good soul, that is worthy enough to have Gotham city spared from God's wrath. Meanwhile <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\" href=\"/ras-al-ghul/4005-40816/\" slug=\"ras-al-ghul\">Ra's al Ghul</a> charges Fireball full of solar energy, turning him into a living bomb, capable of leveling the city.</p><p>The first to be tested is Tim Drake. Azrael hold's Gotham's mayor captive, while The Crusader endangers countless innocents on Tim's path to saving the mayor. The test is whether or not Tim is willing to sacrifice the lives of the innocent to save a sinner. Not willing to sacrifice anyone's life, Tim manages to save all the bystanders, and make it to the mayor in time to spare him. Azrael judges Tim with the Sword of Sin, and see's that his is truly free of sin, but before the city can be spared, The Crusader interjects, claiming he did not honor god, while he saved those trapped inside of a burning church. Not wanting to lie, and actually fail the test, Tim admits his lack of faith, and Azrael deems him unworthy of saving the city.</p><p>Selina is the next to be tested by Azrael, who has been joined by his sister, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49871\" href=\"/maggie-kyle/4005-49871/\" slug=\"maggie-kyle\">Maggie Kyle</a>. Selina's test is whether or not she will sacrifice her sister in the name of God. Despite her sisters pleading, Selina refuses to kill her sister causing her to fail Azrael's tests.</p><p>Dick Grayson is the last to be tested by Azrael, and is confronted by an old acquaintance from his time in the circus, only known as The Prodigy. Azrael forces Dick to come to terms with his childhood sin. Back in the circus, due to jealousy, Dick allowed the Prodigy to be nearly beaten to death. Dick comes to terms with what he didn't do to help Prodigy, but claims his failures doesn't justify the destruction of the city. Dick manages to convince Azrael to use the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56031\" href=\"/sword-of-sin/4055-56031/\" slug=\"sword-of-sin\">Sword of Sin</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56030\" href=\"/sword-of-salvation/4055-56030/\" slug=\"sword-of-salvation\">Sword of Salvation</a> on himself to see the truth. Azrael sees that he is actually carrying out the will of Ra's al Ghul, but it's too late to stop Fireball from detonating. The Crusader manages to contain Fireball's explosion, without any major harm to anyone, except for Fireball who lost his life. With the city safe, Azrael and the Crusader leaves Gotham.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-47612\" href=\"/batman-gotham-shall-be-judged/4050-47612/\" slug=\"batman-gotham-shall-be-judged\">Batman: Gotham Shall Be Judged</a></li></ul>",

however, Graydon Creed makes his move by sending his Tribune troops to the New Warrior base.Â  After defeating the grunts, Justice delivers Firestar to Shaw and the rest of the team makes a visit to Creed.Â  Creed bows out of the game and tells the New Warriors where they can find their friends. <br/>Â <br/>Meeting up in Switzerland, the New Warriors and X-Force team up to make an all-out assault on the Gamesmaster's base and reclaim their teammates.Â  The Gamesmaster uses his captives against their friends and completely nullifies any attack.Â  Paige Guthrie, however, stops the Gamesmaster from killing his prey by proposing a new game.Â  She proposes that the Gamesmaster focus on swaying the future mutants before any other teachers, like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" slug=\"professor-x\">       Professor Xavier</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\" href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" slug=\"cable\">      Cable</a>, can point them in the right direction.Â  The Gamesmaster accepts and leaves the team to lick their wounds. <br/>Â <br/><h2>Effects<br/></h2><h3>X-Force<br/></h3>Seeing how messed up the world was, Paige Guthrie would become one of the founding members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15083\" href=\"/generation-x/4060-15083/\" slug=\"generation-x\">     Generation X</a> team.Â  Cable showed a hint of his abilities as a telepath, which would be expanded in the near future.Â  Moonstar showed an ability to be good, but remained a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-28349\" href=\"/mutant-liberation-front/4060-28349/\" slug=\"mutant-liberation-front\">    Mutant Liberation Front</a>. <br/>Â <br/><h3>The Upstarts<br/></h3>The group almost completely disbanded.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary </h2>Back in 1985, an alien being called the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31123\" href=\"/overmaster/4005-31123/\" slug=\"overmaster\">                           Overmaster</a> came to Earth with intentions to conquer the planet. He created a set of super-villains to herald his arrival, calling them the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47017\" href=\"/cadre/4060-47017/\" slug=\"cadre\">                          Cadre</a>. However, the Overmaster was defeated by the Detroit-era version of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">                         Justice League of America</a>. Now, years later, the Overmaster has returned. <br/>Â <br/>While en route to Earth, the Overmaster sends his powers ahead. The undercurrents of humanity are disrupted by his coming arrival, as sensitives around the planet become unnerved. Cults pop up around the world, causing the three Justice League teams (Justice League America, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-26208\" href=\"/justice-league-international/4060-26208/\" slug=\"justice-league-international\">                        Justice League International</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-25003\" href=\"/justice-league-task-force/4060-25003/\" slug=\"justice-league-task-force\">                       Justice League Task Force</a>) to deal with these cults and madmen. Meanwhile, the Overmasterâs powers trigger the metagenes of various humans, transforming them into his new heralds.

The League falls into disarray, as a team of League reservists fall to the Cadre, and Wonder Woman and Captain Atom fight over the teamâs next course of action. The League splits in two: Captain Atomâs team goes on the offensive, while Wonder Womanâs team continues to stand to the U.N.âs dictum of standing down. Wonder Womanâs team is surprised, and pleased, to learn Booster Gold is alive; however, they find out that it is because all births and deaths on Earth have been frozen with the Overmasterâs arrival.

Blue Beetle comes up with an idea on how to stop the Overmaster, and he and Booster Gold meet up with both Wonder Womanâs and Captain Atomâs team, who are regrouping for a final assault on Overmasterâs ship on Mount Everest. <br/>Â <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1740897-judgmentday2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1740897\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.288\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1740897-judgmentday2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1740897\"><img alt=\"Â Amazing-Man vs. the Overmaster\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83392/1740897-judgmentday2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1740897-judgmentday2.jpg 500w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83392/1740897-judgmentday2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Â Amazing-Man vs. the Overmaster</figcaption></figure>     The League assaults the Overmasterâs ship in three teams: one led by Captain Atom, one by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2384\" href=\"/metamorpho/4005-2384/\" slug=\"metamorpho\">     Metamorpho</a>, and one by Wonder Woman.

    "description": "<h2>Plot SummaryÂ </h2>Bruce Wayne has returned and Gotham is now Dick's responsibility while Bruce Wayne goes international with Batman Inc to recruit soldiers for his Global war against crime. Ra's Al Ghul's father, Sensei, is back and seeks the mask known as the Beholder that grants immense power to its wearer. Sasha Lo and her half-brotherÂ Luki Lo meet with Dick and Lucius Fox, and request that their company purchase Crime Alley from Wayne Enterprises. Sensei sends his henchmen after the Los and kidnaps Luki because they are somehow connected to the mask. He also kidnaps Lucius Fox who used to belong to a brotherhood that is also connected to the mask. After overcoming an ambush by Riddler and his daughter, Batman tracks down Sensei with the help of Catgirl but he is captured. Sensei eventually finds the mask and attempts to use its ultimate power but Sasha warns him that the mask will destroy him because he is unworthy andÂ Luki is revealed to be the trueÂ descendantÂ and owner of the Beholder. An enraged Sensei slices the mask in half and attempts to kill them all but he is tackled by Batman and thrown out of the window. However, he managed to escape with a portion and seeks to reunite it once more. In the end, before leaving Gotham, Peacock tells Batman that the evil is gone for now and Dick feels that he will meet her again as a romantic relationship between the two has been hintedÂ Â <br/><h2>Full Plot</h2>While Bruce is going all over the world to recruit soldiers for his new mission, Bruce gave Gotham City to Dick Grayson while he goes all over the world. As Batman, Dick Grayson will be battling old Batman villains and also new ones. When teaming up with his sidekick Damian Wayne, he and Damian were chasing down the Reaper (whom was still crazy and thought it was War World 2). When Kitrina Falcone (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-68212\" href=\"/kitrina-falcone/4005-68212/\" slug=\"kitrina-falcone\">Catgirl</a>) caught up with Dick and Damian she wanted to take down theÂ <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47593\" href=\"/reaper/4005-47593/\" slug=\"reaper\">Reaper</a>Â for the reward the Government is offering to the person that brings in Reaper dead or alive. When Dick found out what Kitrina was doing, he told her to leave the battle. Reaper took Catgirl by surprise and knocked her unconscious, but before he could kill her, Dick and Damian defeated him. After that, Dick asked Damian where Kitrina was and he replied that she escaped during the fight. Bruce confronts Dick and tells him that Catgirl is out of control and needs to be stopped from vigilante activities. Dick has a talk with Selina Kyle and Kitrina and manages to convince Katrina to cease vigilantism.Â Â <br/>Â <br/>Â Sasha Lo and her half brotherÂ <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76171\" href=\"/luki-lo/4005-76171/\" slug=\"luki-lo\">Luki</a>, appear in Gotham seeking an audience with members of Wayne Enterprises. They meet with Dick and Lucius Fox,Â requesting that The Lo Foundation be able to purchase property within Gotham'sÂ <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55715\" href=\"/crime-alley/4020-55715/\" slug=\"crime-alley\">Crime Alley</a>Â neighborhood, most notably the theater and surrounding area where Bruce's parents were murdered. Claiming she wants to revitalize the area, she tells both Grayson and Fox to inform Bruce about her offer of millions more than the property is worth.Â <br/>Â <br/>Hours later, Grayson notices she's following him. Offering him what essentially is a bribe of ten million dollars, Lo tells Grayson that she wants the deal done as soon as possible, as she suddenly needs to leave the country. Before Grayson canÂ acquireÂ more information, an arrow is shot at Lo, who reacts quick enough to catch it. She tells her driver to bring her brother to safety as she gives chase to the assassin.Â <br/>Â <br/>As Batman, Grayson catches up to Lo who is now in a vibrantly colored costume, both resembling and calling herself Peacock. But as soon as Grayson finds her, the two become surrounded byÂ <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19346\" href=\"/sensei/4005-19346/\" slug=\"sensei\">Sensei</a>Â and his henchmen. They manage to escape and Peacock reveals that Sensei has kidnapped her brother for some unknown reasons and refuses to tell Dick.Â <br/>I-Ching confronts Batman and tells him that Sensei is after a mystical mask called the Beholder that grants its wearer immense power. Sensei kidnaps Lucius Fox who he believes was a member of a secret brotherhood that knows of the Beholder's location. As Batman tries to find more clue, he eventually fall into the mercy of the Riddler and his daughter Enigma who beat him up very badly until Damian appears and helps him fight them off. Batman pays Reaper a visit and asks him about the people he was targeting in Chinatown. Reaper tells Batman to find the Chinese Butcher, Sensei, to save them all.Â Â <br/><br/>Dick then goes to Catwoman's hideout and asks Catgirl to lead him where Reaper was hanging out but made her promise to return to Selina as soon as she was done. When they arrive, following Reaper's clue, Dick realizes that the building Reaper was watching is aÂ ChineseÂ butcher shop. He enters the shop but is ambushed by Sensei and he has his men attempt to drown him along with Luki Lo, Lucius and Tam Fox. After saving the others, Batman fights off Sensei's men with the help of I-Ching.Â <br/>Â <br/>Sensei finds the Beholder in the abandoned archives library of Gotham where he is delayed a bit by Peacock before Batman and the others appear to stop him. However, as Lo warned Sensei, the mask will destroy him because he is not worthy and Luki is revealed to be the trueÂ descendantÂ and owner of the Beholder. An enraged Sensei slices the mask in half and attempts to kill them all but he is tackled by Batman and thrown out of the window. However, he managed to escape with a portion and seeks to reunite it once more. In the end, before leaving Gotham, Peacock tells Batman that the evil is gone for now and Dick feels that he will meet her again. Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â ",
