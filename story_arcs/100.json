    "description": "<h2>In the Beginning</h2><p>Before Humans were the predominant race on the Earth, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\" href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" slug=\"celestials\">Celestials</a> came to the Earth to implant this new planet with one of their eggs. Advanced beyond what most races can even comprehend Celestials reproduce by locating planets which are still in their infancy, and use the planet simultaneously as a surrogate mother and as a source of nourishment for their young. The planet is given deposits of the ore <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\" href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" slug=\"vibranium\">Vibranium</a> which will eventually act as a cancer overtaking the world and its inhabitants and converting energy into nourishment for the egg. The gestation process alone takes thousands of years, and the Celestials have enemy races that would destroy their young. To prevent other races from destroying their young they take the Earth's dominant life-form, an early version of man, and bio-engineer a portion of the population to act as a sentient immune system for the dormant Celestial. From early man the Celestials created the race of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13345\" href=\"/deviants/4060-13345/\" slug=\"deviants\">Deviants</a>, a race whose aggression was to be suitable to make them defend their planet from any invaders, hostile or otherwise, and by doing so inadvertently protect and maintain the Celestial Egg. The Deviants, however, contained far too much aggression. They became a destructive race, endangering the balance and the safety of the Egg. In order to maintain balance and prevent the Deviants from destroying the planet, the Celestials created the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\" href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" slug=\"eternals\">Eternals</a>, a race who would be engineered to become the antithesis of the Deviant life-forms on Earth.</p><p>The Celestials saw that the conflict between the Eternals and Deviants would mean the mutually assured destruction of both races leaving the Egg once again unprotected. The Celestials would then tamper with the remainder of the Human race, not to create another race immediatly, but this time to plant a genetic seed within the growing human race. The purpose of this \"Celestial Seed\" within the Human race would be two-fold. First of all the human race would blossom and evolve in a pre-determined pattern to suit the Celestials needs. This process of development would follow the natural course of Human evolution, allowing Humans to live and grow isolated from the conflict of the Eternals and Deviants. It wouldn't be until after the Eternals and Deviants had outlived their usefulness when the seed implanted within the race would bloom, allowing humans to pick up the job of being the Egg's primary defense against the outside world. The second thing that this genetic seed would do is influence the actions of the human race such that individual members would fulfill a much greater roll in the protection of the egg than any one could understand. The implications of this are far-reaching because this seed could have bearing on every act and decision made by any humans on Earth. In the mountains high above the still-evolving human race, Eternals would be seen as gods and worshipped, while the Deviants below would be feared as devils and demons. The Celestials would make an agreement with the remaining life-forms of the Earth that would grow to be worshipped as other gods of the Human race not to interfere.</p><p>The first enemy of the Celestials to show interest in the Human race would be the alien <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43140\" href=\"/kree/4015-43140/\" slug=\"kree\">Kree</a>. Taking a small subset of the population for genetic research, the Kree would work to enhance and speed up the evolution of Humans in order to create a new race of living weapons for use against the Celestials, the Inhumans. Not desiring to be pawns of the Kree, the Inhumans grew powerful and became independent of their creators. Living in the sanctuary of their hidden city of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-44155\" href=\"/attilan/4020-44155/\" slug=\"attilan\">Attilan</a>, the Inhumans would remain Isolated from the Human race for much of their development.</p><p>Along with the inhabitants of Earth which were designed to protect the Celestial Egg, the Celestials would appoint a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11523\" href=\"/the-watchers/4060-11523/\" slug=\"the-watchers\">The Watchers</a> to keep watch over the planet and record the events which occur. The Watchers had entered into an agreement with the Celestials long ago, and remained tasked with the duty of watching the planets which house Celestial Eggs. The watcher of Earth <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\" href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" slug=\"watcher\">Watcher</a>, would be stationed on the Earth's moon where he could observe, only interfering in order to maintain the Celestial's greater plans for the Earth.</p><p>As the Human race would grow and develop, variations on would slowly begin to crop up. Often triggered by outside influence such as secret formulas, genetic manipulation, or radiation various individuals would develop powers and abilities that would set themselves apart from the rest of their species. These mutations and evolutionary jumps would not be the result of accident or nature as man would come to believe, but the triggering of the Celestial Seed whose germination inside individual humans would manifest as the powers and abilities of some of these individuals. Some of the manifestations of the awakened Celestial seed within mankind would include <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America</a> created by a scientist during World War II whose mutation was triggered by a secret formula developed to create super soldiers, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\" href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" slug=\"fantastic-four\">Fantastic Four</a> whose mutation was triggered by cosmic radiation, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\">Spider-Man</a> whose mutation was triggered by the bite of a radioactive spider, the Incredible <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\" href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" slug=\"hulk\">Hulk</a> whose mutation was triggered by gama radiation, and finally <a data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\" href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" slug=\"mutant\">Mutant</a> whose mutation was seemingly the natural course of the species' evolution. Humans would regard these changes as acts of god or science, remaining ignorant to the Celestial's plans and tampering.</p><h2>Inhuman Earth</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\" href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" slug=\"black-bolt\">Black Bolt</a>'s brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3447\" href=\"/maximus/4005-3447/\" slug=\"maximus\">Maximus</a> creates a weapon based on the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\" href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" slug=\"inhumans\">Inhumans</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40921\" href=\"/terrigen-mists/4055-40921/\" slug=\"terrigen-mists\">Terrigen Mists</a> to turn the population of Earth into a super-powered population that he could rule as king. The Inhuman Royal Family was trapped with the exception of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3534\" href=\"/lockjaw/4005-3534/\" slug=\"lockjaw\">Lockjaw</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\" href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" slug=\"medusa\">Medusa</a>, and Black Bolt. Maximus killed Lockjaw sending his brother into a rage that caused him to kill Maximus. It was around this time the Inhuman population began to grow tired of hiding from the less powerful human race within the walls of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-44155\" href=\"/attilan/4020-44155/\" slug=\"attilan\">Attilan</a>. Ignoring the warnings posed by the Royal Council that they could not survive the pollutant and pathogen saturated environment of the Earth, the Inhumans left the sanctuary of Attilan to live amongst the humans. Mistaken for mutants the Inhumans were persecuted and murdered. Weakened and sick from the Earth's contaminated atmosphere, the once powerful Inhumans were unable to fight back. Black Bolt and the rest of the Royal Family were preparing to leave the Earth for good, but Black Bolt could not leave his people under these conditions. Setting off Maximus' weapon, the Terrigen Mists were released into the Earth's atmosphere. Mixing with the contaminants and pollutants that already existed in the atmosphere the Terrigen Mists were transformed into a form that was not harmful to humans and simultaneously altered the Earth's atmospheric pollution safe for the Inhuman population of Earth. The new Terrigen Mist-altered atmosphere of Earth would mutate the human population of the Earth granting everyone super-powers as well as enhancing the mutations of the Inhuman population. Most likely having some idea of the purpose of the Earth's <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11523\" href=\"/the-watchers/4060-11523/\" slug=\"the-watchers\">The Watchers</a>, before setting off Maximus' bomb Black Bolt snuck into the home of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\" href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" slug=\"watcher\">Watcher</a> to blind him. Blinded, Uatu would not be able to see or record the events that transpired around the mutation of the Earth's population or any other events in his sector for the next ten years. Human Mutants and other previously super-powered individuals would have already had their Celestial Seed germinated and would be spared further mutation by the Terrigen Mists.</p><p>Meanwhile <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\" href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" slug=\"mr-fantastic\">Mr. Fantastic</a> was using the Earth's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\" href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" slug=\"vibranium\">Vibranium</a> deposits to develop a network of power centers to solve the Earth's energy problems. He had hoped to use vibranium convert certain minerals native to the Earth into sound energy which could be relayed around the Earth through receptive towers. A problem with one of his reactors would create a chain reaction of explosions around the world. The mutation of the Earth's population would be blamed on Richards' experiments (and Reed would be particularly hard on himself). Reed believed that the fallout of the explosions was instantly beamed around the world thought the network of transmission towers which were already in operation.</p><h2>Fall of the Heroes</h2><p>In the years after the release of the Terrigen Mists the lives of the world's original super-heroes would change dramatically. With global food shortages on the rise, the sea was turned to for a food source. The United Nations would meet concerning the food supply, but would exclude <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\" href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" slug=\"namor\">Namor</a> believing that he would voice against using the oceans to feed the mainland countries. Knowing that controlling the world's food supply would mean controlling the world, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">Doctor Doom</a> approached an angry Namor and convinced him to help attack the United Nations. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\" href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" slug=\"fantastic-four\">Fantastic Four</a> with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America</a> would be the first to respond to the threat. Against Captain America's warnings <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\" href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" slug=\"human-torch\">Human Torch</a> attempted to subdue Namor and who broke his neck. Seeing his uncle killed pushed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\" href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" slug=\"franklin-richards\">Franklin Richards</a> over the edge. Franklin told Namor that he wanted him to burn and never stop. The entire left half of Namor's body would burst into flames that even diving back into the ocean could not extinguish. The Fantastic Four would then turn on Doom, blaming him for Johnny's death. Doom started to tell Reed that he knew what actually caused the mutations and that he had a cure. Before Doom could explain himself to Reed, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\" href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" slug=\"invisible-woman\">Invisible Woman</a> chased after Doom. A nearby explosion killed both Doom and Sue, leaving Reed to never know what Doom actually meant.</p><p>After Sue's death Reed became reclusive and eccentric. Not only was his wife gone, but he continued to blame himself for not only the grotesque mutation of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\" href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" slug=\"thing\">Thing</a> but of the entire world. Trying to discover the secret Doom hinted to, Reed chose to move into Doom's castle in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\" href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" slug=\"latveria\">Latveria</a>. So that Doom's <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11924\" href=\"/doombots/4005-11924/\" slug=\"doombots\">Doombots</a> would not see him as an intruder Reed chose to don one of Doom's old costumes. Unknowing of what happened to their leader, Reed continued to act as ruler of Latveria in Doom's stead. The superstitious Latverian population would come to believe that something was wrong with their leader, but never to understand the truth. Obsessed only with curing the world, Reed stopped using his powers.</p><p>Reed's leaving the Fantastic Four caused the group to break up completely. Ben Grimm would go on to marry his long-time girlfriend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4337\" href=\"/alicia-masters/4005-4337/\" slug=\"alicia-masters\">Alicia Masters</a>, whose Terrigen Mist mutation would allow her animate her sculptures, creating mindless clay servants. Together the two would have two boys: Buzz and Chuck, both with mutations that resemble their father's. The family would take up a quite life in New York.</p><p>The Fantastic Four would not be the only super-heroes that felt the toll of time. The Hulk would marry <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10870\" href=\"/betty-banner/4005-10870/\" slug=\"betty-banner\">Betty Banner</a> and she would die of radiation poisoning from exposure to the Hulk's enemies. While they radiated the gamma energy that created them, the Hulk would continue absorbing energy. This would account for the many forms that the Hulk. As Hulk continued to absorb ambient gamma energy the Celestial Seed within him began to seek independence from its host, something that had never occurred before. Banner's physical form would result in two separate entities similar to his psyche. The human side of his personality created the form of a child-like version of Bruce known as Banner. Banner retained Bruce's intelligence and personality, but was blind. The Hulk aspect of his personality took a form resembling the original Hulk, but while large and green took a more ape-like appearance. This form of the Hulk had no mind or soul of its own. Banner controlled Hulk's actions, but was also dependent on the Hulk because the blind Banner saw through the Hulk's eyes. Banner would ride the Hulk and symbolic of the pair's relationship all of Bruce's life the pair would be inseparable.</p><p>Captain America would finally defeat and kill his archenemy the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\" href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" slug=\"red-skull\">Red Skull</a>, and after doing so believed himself unfit to continue being a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\" href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" slug=\"avengers\">Avengers</a> and left the team. The years have not been kind to Steve Rogers (often still referred to as \"Cap\" by former friends and teammates). He has become older, bitter, and angry. Still acting as a vigilante, Cap's is often viewed as a relic and having lost some of his sanity. Cap's costume has broken down over the years with only his pants and boots remaining. Still using his shield as a weapon and draped in an old American flag, Cap is somewhere between a hero and a joke.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\" href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" slug=\"luke-cage\">Luke Cage</a> would join the NYPD. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\">Spider-Man</a> no longer saw any reason to protect a population that could just as easily protect itself and quit being Spider-Man (Mary Jane had died). His former secret identity is no longer a secret. At some point his daughter May acquired the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\" href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" slug=\"venom\">Venom</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42358\" href=\"/symbiote/4015-42358/\" slug=\"symbiote\">Symbiote</a> and would take his place as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3365\" href=\"/spider-girl/4005-3365/\" slug=\"spider-girl\">Spider-Girl</a>. May believed that she was now in control of Venom but Peter was skeptical causing even more strain in their relationship. The original Daredevil is no where to be found in this alternate future. In his stead is a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\" href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" slug=\"daredevil\">Daredevil</a> who is a circus performer. Daredevil is unable to be hurt. Either feeling no pain or enjoying pain, he allows himself to be shot, stabbed, blown up, crushed, or anything else he believes will please his audiences. Working with a group of <a data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\" href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" slug=\"mutant\">Mutant</a>, they entertain night after night always seeking larger audiences and grander spectacles.</p><p>Benny Beckley (the son of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10953\" href=\"/comet-man/4005-10953/\" slug=\"comet-man\">Comet Man</a>) would manifest his powers around the time of the release of the Terrigen Mists. He became a powerful telepath capable of controlling the actions (by controlling the mind) of anyone he comes near. The manifestation of Beckley's powers would create a wave of pure psychic energy that killed all of the world's telepaths including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" slug=\"professor-x\">Professor X</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a>. He would go on to call himself <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10954\" href=\"/the-skull/4005-10954/\" slug=\"the-skull\">The Skull</a> and adopt a red variation on the Punisher's symbol.</p><p>With Professor Xavier gone the X-Men are broken up. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" slug=\"jean-grey\">Jean Grey</a> was thought to have lost her powers before the manifestation of the Skull which saved her from the psychic fallout of the Skull's powers. In reality Jean had died when the Skull manifested his powers and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10981\" href=\"/madelyne-pryor/4005-10981/\" slug=\"madelyne-pryor\">Madelyne Pryor</a> took over her identity. Pryor married Wolverine and the two live together. Have adopted a rather sedentary lifestyle they have become overweight and unhappy together. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> has attempted to adopt a more normal life, lamenting losing Jean to Wolverine. His brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\" href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" slug=\"havok\">Havok</a> as well as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1473\" href=\"/polaris/4005-1473/\" slug=\"polaris\">Polaris</a> have joined the space pirate team of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-14871\" href=\"/starjammers/4060-14871/\" slug=\"starjammers\">Starjammers</a> with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7591\" href=\"/corsair/4005-7591/\" slug=\"corsair\">Corsair</a> and continually attempt to convince Scott to leave the Earth with them. Never wanting to leave Jean alone on Earth, Scott remains. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\" href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" slug=\"iceman\">Iceman</a> has become stuck in his ice form. Now in danger of melting in warmer climates, Iceman lives in relative solitude at the north pole where he can remain in sub-zero temperatures. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\" href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" slug=\"angel\">Angel</a> lost his fortune and had adopted a life of philanthropy becoming a \"guardian angel\". His vast wealth and position of power was always a constant worry for Warren, and ironically it took him losing everything he once valued to find happiness for the first time. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\" href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" slug=\"storm\">Storm</a> left America and is married to the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\" href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" slug=\"black-panther\">Black Panther</a>. The two rule over Africa. The Black Panther had mutated into a humanoid panther after exposure to the Terrigen Mists. Beast is now a member of Storm and the Black Panther's court. Other than his fur turning white, there appears to be little difference between his current and future self.</p><p>Besides Cap <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\" href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" slug=\"iron-man\">Iron Man</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" slug=\"thor\">Thor</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\" href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" slug=\"vision\">Vision</a> are some of the few surviving members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\" href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" slug=\"avengers\">Avengers</a>. Thor's brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\" href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" slug=\"loki\">Loki</a> had tricked their father <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\" href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" slug=\"odin\">Odin</a> into believing that Thor needed a punishment to humble him, and Odin turned Thor into a Woman. Thor remains on Earth because leaving for <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\" href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" slug=\"asgard\">Asgard</a> to show Odin what really happened would mean leaving the Earth unprotected and vulnerable to Loki's trickery. Iron Man has locked himself away in a sterilized environment. He is permanently connected to his machinery. With the other Avengers dead, Stark has built robotic homages to his fallen comrades known as the Iron Avengers. The team he commands consists of the Vision and robotic versions of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\" href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" slug=\"hank-pym\">Hank Pym</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\" href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" slug=\"wasp\">Wasp</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\" href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" slug=\"hawkeye\">Hawkeye</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\" href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" slug=\"scarlet-witch\">Scarlet Witch</a>. An alien plague known as <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\" href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" slug=\"hydra\">Hydra</a> has also overcome sections of New York. Where the Hydra of modern time is simply an annoyance to many heroes, the Hydra alien <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42358\" href=\"/symbiote/4015-42358/\" slug=\"symbiote\">Symbiote</a> attaches itself to its hosts and controls their minds, linking them to a de-centralized hive-mind. Cap's former partner the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\" href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" slug=\"falcon\">Falcon</a> is one of the many that are controlled by Hydra. Along with protecting New York from conventional threats, the Iron Avengers are tasked with the duty of containing the Hydra infection by destroying the infected when they are found.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-3175\" href=\"/sunfire/4005-3175/\" slug=\"sunfire\">Sunfire</a> has become the emperor of Japan, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\" href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" slug=\"colossus\">Colossus</a> has become ruler of Russia. With worldwide food shortages, Russia has become an important entity providing a large percentage of the world's food. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\" href=\"/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" slug=\"captain-britain\">Captain Britain</a> rules England and has been entrusted with the care of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\" href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" slug=\"black-bolt\">Black Bolt</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\" href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" slug=\"medusa\">Medusa</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\" href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" slug=\"inhumans\">Inhumans</a> son. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1484\" href=\"/green-goblin/4005-1484/\" slug=\"green-goblin\">Green Goblin</a> has become the President of America. He has reached an agreement with Tony Stark to use the Iron Avengers for enforcement.</p><h2>A New Watcher</h2><p>The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\" href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" slug=\"watcher\">Watcher</a> has been blinded for approximately ten years. He has not witnessed or recorded any of the events since Black Bolt secretly blinded him and released the Terrigen Mists into the Earths atmosphere. Knowing that his job must be done by someone, the Watcher teleports the robot Aaron Stack (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-7242\" href=\"/machine-man/4005-7242/\" slug=\"machine-man\">Machine Man</a>) to his home on the moon. While doing so, he took away Aaron's face and appearance by making his exterior transparent revealing the mechanical workings of his inner body. The Watcher's hope is to break Aaron's spirit. Aaron has lived his life as a man--with programming created by his father Able designed to replicate the flaws, emotions, and curiosity of a human. The Watcher knows that in order to do the job of a Watcher one must lose their emotional attachments to those that he watches or he cannot succeed in his job. Being seen only through a large screen, the Watcher explains to Stack that his job is to record all events on Earth and that since someone needs to do his job he has located Aaron, the only person on Earth capable of watching everything at once. He refers to Aaron as his model number X-51 to try to further impart upon him that he is not a man and is only a machine. Uatu explains to Aaron a brief version of the history of the Earth carefully leaving out certain facts about the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\" href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" slug=\"celestials\">Celestials</a> that he believes an emotional X-51 is not prepared to handle. Without divulging the existence of the celestial egg, he leads X-51 to believe that the evolution of mankind based on the Celestial seed within man was not to protect the Earth, but to instead guide human evolution to the point where humans will evolve into Celestials themselves.</p><p>After showing X-51 how to operate the Watcher's machinery, X-51 begins to simultaneously piece together for the Watcher the events that transpired since the release of the Terrigen Mists by viewing all electronic data saved on the history of the Earth and to watch and record events as they continue to transpire in the present.</p><h2>Rise of the Skull</h2><p>X-51 moves his attention to Cap and the Skull. Capable to control the minds of anyone that comes in contact with him <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10954\" href=\"/the-skull/4005-10954/\" slug=\"the-skull\">The Skull</a> is able to build up an army. Anyone that threatens his safety or reign simply becomes another pawn. He has fashioned a throne out of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\" href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" slug=\"modok\">MODOK</a>'s body and armor which his servants move for him. At some point even Namor had become one of his slaves. Still in a permanent state of flame, Namor is forced to collect food from the oceans to feed the Skull's army. Other important members include the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10968\" href=\"/iron-maiden/4005-10968/\" slug=\"iron-maiden\">Iron Maiden</a> and Spiders-Man. Iron Maiden was involved in an accident with a silver acid compound. The compound coated her body and along with enhanced strength and flight she is able to turn her body into any form of weapon she desires including blast weapons. She acts as the Skull's primary body guard. Spiders-Man gained his powers by the Terrigen Mists. His appearance is similar to that of Spider-Man's old costume, and he wears a tattered cloak to hide his disfigured appearance. Spiders-Man has the power to weave web-like illusions casting whatever he wants someone to see-from their dreams come true to their worst nightmares.</p><p>While fighting Hydra in New York with his partner <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10275\" href=\"/wyatt-wingfoot/4005-10275/\" slug=\"wyatt-wingfoot\">Wyatt Wingfoot</a>, Cap discovers a shard of fabric with the Skull's symbol on it. Horrified that someone else has taken the mantle of the Red Skull, Cap sets out to locate the Skull and to take him down. When he finds the Skull's camp he sees first hand the magnitude of the Skull's domination over the people. The Skull has taken the will of an army of former super-heroes and villains that are forced to do his bidding. Wyatt finds that he is unable to move under his own free will any longer as the Skull has taken over his body. The Skull calls out Cap, and Cap begins to try to talk the Skull down. The Skull explains to Cap that he is helping the people he is taking over by giving them some purpose. Rather than taking over control of Cap the Skull does not see him as worth using. Instead he has his army beat Cap physically and pelt him with rocks. More depressed and ready to give up than ever, Cap contemplates giving up hope.</p><h2>Back to Earth</h2><p>While Cap is trying to uncover the secret of the Skull, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\" href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" slug=\"inhumans\">Inhumans</a> are just returning from a venture into deep space. The Inhumans have discovered some disconcerting information about the possible future of the Earth. They have located a planet far from our own that was destroyed along with all of its inhabitants. They identified survivors of this planet which they were unable to save. These survivors were being killed by a cancerous infection of an alloy that can be found in certain areas on the Earth--<a data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\" href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" slug=\"vibranium\">Vibranium</a>. Upon returning to the Earth, they seek out a man who they believe is intelligent enough to help them find what is the problem--<a data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\" href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" slug=\"mr-fantastic\">Mr. Fantastic</a>. They first find the apartment of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\" href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" slug=\"thing\">Thing</a> and family. Ben and Alicia serve the Inhuman royalty dinner while Ben explains to them the events that occurred in their absence including the downfall of Mr. Fantastic. Ben remarks that Reed just doesn't feel like a hero anymore. After learning what has become of Richards, the Inhumans travel to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">Doctor Doom</a>'s castle in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\" href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" slug=\"latveria\">Latveria</a> where Reed explains to them what happened to the human population in their absence. They use the head adorning horn of the deceased Royal Family member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3534\" href=\"/lockjaw/4005-3534/\" slug=\"lockjaw\">Lockjaw</a> to teleport around the world instantaneously. He explains of how his experiments with vibranium as an energy source ended in a catastrophic series of explosions and how it was this disaster that caused the mutation of the Earth's population.</p><p>The Inhumans listen to Reed's story, unknowing that it was their king <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\" href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" slug=\"black-bolt\">Black Bolt</a> who detonated Maximus' device who altered the Earth's population rather than Reed's experiments. Because this is her first exposure to the Mists <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10962\" href=\"/luna/4005-10962/\" slug=\"luna\">Luna</a>, daughter of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\" href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" slug=\"crystal\">Crystal</a> begins to mutate and change. The rest of the Royal family had already mutated farther than originally. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\" href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" slug=\"medusa\">Medusa</a>'s prehensile hair now covers most of her face. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10975\" href=\"/karnak/4005-10975/\" slug=\"karnak\">Karnak</a> has become smaller in stature and withered. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4330\" href=\"/gorgon/4005-4330/\" slug=\"gorgon\">Gorgon</a> has taken on even more animal appearances including fur, an elongated snout, and horns. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11428\" href=\"/triton/4005-11428/\" slug=\"triton\">Triton</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\" href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" slug=\"crystal\">Crystal</a> have evolved in appearance and power as well. Triton is now longer and more snake like looking more like a sea monster than ever. The Inhumans explain their discovery of the vibranium destroyed planet to Reed, along with the discovery of that planet's life forms who resemble the Earth's <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\" href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" slug=\"eternals\">Eternals</a> both genetically and otherwise. After dwelling on Reed's story the Inhumans discuss Richards' hypothesis, and Karnak voices concern. Karnak's power is to discern flaws, physical or otherwise in opponents, structures, and anything else he comes in contact with. He states that Reed's hypothesis on how his doomed experiment caused the entire population to change was perfect-too perfect. Any such sequence of events must have some small flaw in it. Reed's explanation contained no such flaw and therefore was unbelievable.</p><p>The Inhumans desire to locate the members of their population on Earth now that they have returned. Reed comes up with an answer in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" slug=\"professor-x\">Professor X</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\" href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" slug=\"cerebro\">Cerebro</a> technology. Cerebro was once calibrated and used by Xavier to view a population and to help sort out which are humans and which are Inhuman based on their genetic signals. Reed believed that since the entire population was now mutant that all it would take would be to reverse the calibration of Cerebro to locate anyone who was not mutant, and would therefore be Inhuman. Reed borrows Lockjaw's horn from the Inhumans to locate Cerebro and make the modifications necessary to locate their people. As Reed leaves the Doombots believe the Inhumans to be invaders and begin to attack. Meanwhile Reed first teleports to the ruins of the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" slug=\"xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> in Westchester where he locates the Cerebro helmet, and then to New York to the home of his friend and former treammate Ben Grimm.</p><h2>New X-Men</h2><p>A confused and lonely Cap sits while the Skull's army prepares around him. He contemplates his position and how perhaps things are as futile as the Skull says. Cap's salvation comes just soon enough in the form of the circus performer, the Daredevil. Cap is reluctant to accept Daredevil's assistance against the Skull. First he is skeptical of Daredevil as he is a performer that seeks to have his audience blow him up and shoot him. Secondly, Cap explains to Daredevil that his history with partners is not good as all of his past partners have been either killed or taken over. Daredevil explains that this is the reason he wants to join Cap's cause. Joining forces with Cap, Cap sends Daredevil's mutant circus performers to New York to locate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> for training in the use of their powers for combat.</p><p>The mutants find Cyclops in Central Park. They launch an attack on an unknowing Cyclops in order to prove to their possible mentor that they already know how to fight. The experienced former X-Men leader is able to easily take down the team including an illusion caster, a giant, a Beast-like acrobat, a flying mermaid, and a two-headed man. Defeated, they explain their intentions to Cyclops and that it was Captain America that sent them to him for training. Wanting to help out his old friend, Cyclops agrees to train the mutants and begins their training in an impromptu <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41918\" href=\"/danger-room/4020-41918/\" slug=\"danger-room\">Danger Room</a> in an abandoned warehouse. Scott outfits the team in X-Men like uniforms for their training, asks to be called Mr. S, and begins their training as their new leader.</p><h2>Learning the Truth</h2><p>Back in New York Ben guides Reed to a back room where he had stored many of his machines from his tenure as Mr. Fantastic. When Professor Xavier was alive Reed had mapped out his brain, and needed the schematics that he had stored. When he found the scan of Xavier's brain Reed realized that it was a certain enlarged region of the Professor's brain which allowed him to access his telepathy. Using his ability to stretch for the first time in years Reed stretches his brain to match the schematics of Xavier's to create his own telepathic abilities. Now that Reed is able to use the Cerebro helmet as Xavier once did he goes outside to test out his modifications to the helmet and himself. Richards uses the helmet on the general public. To his immense surprise where the Inhumans it locates where supposed to be few, all of the Earth's mutated population was registering as Inhuman. The people of Earth had not been turned into Mutants, they were somehow turned into Inhumans.</p><h2>The Search for Mar-Vell</h2><p>Banner had been having strange dreams involving the nature of the universe, and the deceased hero <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\" href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" slug=\"captain-marvel\">Captain Marvel</a>. He had remembered that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\" href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" slug=\"doctor-strange\">Doctor Strange</a> had once told him that everything had a realm, including death. Banner hoped that Strange could guide him to the realm of death in order to ask Marvel personally about the dreams he had been having. Upon reaching Doctor Strange's house he found Strange's student and lover <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2216\" href=\"/clea/4005-2216/\" slug=\"clea\">Clea</a>. Clea told Banner that while Strange's body is still living, his soul has been lost to him. She said that despite her resources, she has not been able to find any magic that could bring Strange's soul back to him or find out exactly what had happened to him. Doctor Strange's faithful friend and servant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2215\" href=\"/wong/4005-2215/\" slug=\"wong\">Wong</a> now served Clea, aiding her as the current sorcerer supreme. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" slug=\"thor\">Thor</a> had also agreed to accompany Banner on his quest as a protector from whatever Banner and Hulk would face in the realm of death.</p><p>It is noteworthy, that after Mar-Vell and his army of sorts defeat Death itself, (leaving no death or rest for the suffering in hospitals and such), Mar-Vell decides to restore Death itself, but remains alive himself, and when asked where he is going after the story's climatic finale, the character replies \"Someplace better\" in a physical form on the plane of the living.</p><h2>Issue Checklist</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-6354\" href=\"/earth-x/4050-6354/\" slug=\"earth-x\">Earth X</a> #0</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-6354\" href=\"/earth-x/4050-6354/\" slug=\"earth-x\">Earth X</a> #Â½</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-6354\" href=\"/earth-x/4050-6354/\" slug=\"earth-x\">Earth X</a> #1-12</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-6354\" href=\"/earth-x/4050-6354/\" slug=\"earth-x\">Earth X</a> #X</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-6354\" href=\"/earth-x/4050-6354/\" slug=\"earth-x\">Earth X</a> Sketchbook</li></ul><h2>Related Story-Arcs</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4045-44816\" href=\"/universe-x/4045-44816/\" slug=\"universe-x\">Universe X</a> - Story-arch that occurs after the events of Earth X and chronicles the next chapter in the history of Earth.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4045-44817\" href=\"/paradise-x/4045-44817/\" slug=\"paradise-x\">Paradise X</a> - Final installment of the Earth X series.

    "deck": "The Great Fear was an event in Marvel's Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme comics that encompassed the time when Dweller In Darkness formed the Fear Lords and attempted to engulf earth in \"The Great Fear.\"",
    "description": "<p>The Formation of the Fear Lords</p><p>=======</p><p>Beginning in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-4049\" href=\"/doctor-strange-sorcerer-supreme/4050-4049/\" slug=\"doctor-strange-sorcerer-supreme\">Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme</a> issue 31, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13999\" href=\"/dweller-in-darkness/4005-13999/\" slug=\"dweller-in-darkness\">Dweller In Darkness</a> is seen sitting at a table in his Halls of Fear with what is soon recognized as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-28159\" href=\"/fear-lords/4060-28159/\" slug=\"fear-lords\">Fear Lords</a>.  He explains to them that he has summoned them, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44282\" href=\"/kkallakku/4005-44282/\" slug=\"kkallakku\">Kkallakku</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27793\" href=\"/nox/4005-27793/\" slug=\"nox\">Nox</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2646\" href=\"/nightmare/4005-2646/\" slug=\"nightmare\">Nightmare</a>, D'Spayre, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27818\" href=\"/lurking-unknown/4005-27818/\" slug=\"lurking-unknown\">Lurking Unknown</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44252\" href=\"/straw-man/4005-44252/\" slug=\"straw-man\">Straw Man</a>, because they are the greatest inducers of fear the universe has known.  He then explains his plan to them, that they are to take over the planet earth!  The members, save for the Lurking Unknown, then passed around their backgrounds, and told of their defeats at the hands of various earth heroes, such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" slug=\"thor\">Thor</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\" href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" slug=\"doctor-strange\">Doctor Strange</a>.  When all was said and done, Straw Man warned the others against going after earth, claiming that he saw it as a home, when he in fact was a guardian of earth mortals.  After making his warning, Straw Man exited the Halls of Fear.</p><p>Straw Man's Betrayal</p><p>=======</p><p>After leaving the Halls of Fear, Straw Man proceede to inform Dr. Strange of the Fear Lords' imminant strike.  When Straw Man finished telling Dr. Strange and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2216\" href=\"/clea/4005-2216/\" slug=\"clea\">Clea</a> of the plot, the Lurking Unknown set fire to Straw Man, incinerating his physical body near instantly.  Although it seemed Straw Man was dead, his spiritual essence had in fact been transported back into his painted dimension.  Although the Lurking Fear was truly in his element of fear, Dr. Strange and Clea still proved to be too much for him, and defeated him quickly.</p><p>One Down...</p><p>=======</p><p>After the Lurking Unknown's defeat, we see the Dweller In Darkness thinking to himself, pondering over his next movement of action, now that his plan was underway and, as he stated, \"One down.\"  Nox then attacked the city near Dr. Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum.  Using the citizens' fear, she resurrected her two god-sons, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27796\" href=\"/deimos/4005-27796/\" slug=\"deimos\">Deimos</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27794\" href=\"/phobos/4005-27794/\" slug=\"phobos\">Phobos</a>.  Kkallakku then took advantage of the fear that Nox was causing and attacked with his <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27797\" href=\"/fear-eaters/4005-27797/\" slug=\"fear-eaters\">Fear Eaters</a>.  Dr. Strange had encountered the Kkallakki before, and knew their strengths and weaknesses.  Using his knowledge of the alien race, he cast a spell to draw the fear of all the people into himself, and lured the Fear Eaters, along with Kkallakku, into a portal to another dimension.  After they were through, he utilized his dimension-distorted minimal size to sneak past the Fear Eaters and back through the portal, where, on the other side, he sealed it shut, trapping the Fear Eaters on the other side.  In the meantime, Clea and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14794\" href=\"/rintrah/4005-14794/\" slug=\"rintrah\">Rintrah</a> broke free from the clutches of Deimos and Phobos, and dispatched of them.  Nox, again distressed by the deaths of her sons, escaped through a dimensional portal.  Afterwards, we again see the Dweller In Darkness speaking to himself, saying \"That's another two down, now to get rid of Nightmare and D'Spayre...\",  but this time, Nightmare was listening to the Dweller.  Dr. Strange was also listening, thus the Dweller's plans of secrecy were destroyed.</p><p>D'Spayre's Game</p><p>=======</p><p>D'Spayre went to Nightmare, believing his power was greater than that of the Dweller, and offered his assistance to him.  The two the began their reign of terror over the citizens of earth.  The Dweller In Darkness saw this as a challenge to prove who was more powerful, and began instilling his own fear into the mortals.  But when the three Fear Lords put all of their efoort into the Fear, the humans began to forget their fear and know only despair.  When this happened, Nightmare and the Dweller began to lose their power, and D'Spayre grew in power to a near omnipotent state.  Realizing what had happened, the Dweller and Nightmare escaped.  Gathering their strength, Dr. Strange, Rintrah, Clea, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\" href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" slug=\"daredevil\">Daredevil</a>, and the reincarnated Straw Man attacked D'Spayre.  Their courage proved to be too much for D'Spayre, and the last Fear Lord faded into nothingness, thus ending the reign of the Great Fear.</p>",

Annihilus believed that our universe was growing while <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\" href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" slug=\"the-negative-zone\">The Negative Zone</a> was shrinking. He saw this encroaching upon Negative Zone space as an invasion of his territory by our universe, and saw conquest and destruction as his only option. Composed of Annihilus' Negative Zone armies, the Wave spread and threatened to destroy everything in its path. Leading the remaining <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43140\" href=\"/kree/4015-43140/\" slug=\"kree\">Kree</a> armies, several of the universes greatest heroes sought to put an end to Annihilus' path of destruction.

Annihilus began by trying to capture the heralds of Galactus to study the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41039\" href=\"/power-cosmic/4015-41039/\" slug=\"power-cosmic\">Power Cosmic</a> that they possessed, drawing them as well as their former master into the war. Recently freed from the prison Galactus had put them in long ago, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42607\" href=\"/aegis/4005-42607/\" slug=\"aegis\">Aegis</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42608\" href=\"/tenebrous/4005-42608/\" slug=\"tenebrous\">Tenebrous</a> were able to defeat Galactus and the Silver Surfer. With Galactus and the Surfer incapacitated, Thanos was able to study Galactus' technology and biology to design equipment which would harness the Power Cosmic which Galactus' body collected when he consumed planets. Keeping Galactus weak by starving his body of the cosmic energy required to sustain him, Galactus and the surfer were kept in a state of stasis while helping build up massive stores of Cosmic Energy. Thanos was able to transform Galactus' very body into a living weapon, generating blasts of cosmic energy powerful enough to destroy entire planets.</p><p>It was at this point when a captured <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\" href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" slug=\"moondragon\">Moondragon</a> had read Annihilus' mind and informed Thanos that Annihilus planned not only for conquest, but the destruction of everything in all Universe so that he may rule over everything that is (which is nothing). Knowing of the impending treachery, Thanos prepared to activate a fail-safe which was keyed into his own power level to release Galactus. Before Thanos was able to release Galactus, Drax ripped out Thanos' heart, killing him. After freeing the Silver Surfer, the Surfer was able to generate enough energy to break Galactus' bonds. Freed from Annihilus, Galactus went on a rampage destroying all of the Annihilation Wave forces in the vacinity.</p><p>With his forces crippled, Annihilus was confronted by Phyla, Quill, and Nova. With the Nova Corps destroyed and the power of the entire Corps at his disposal, Nova was still not as powerful as Annihilus who now possessed Quasar's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-42361\" href=\"/quantum-bands/4055-42361/\" slug=\"quantum-bands\">Quantum Bands</a>. Phyla attempted to prevent Nova's death and grabbed Annihilus' arms, touching the Quantum Bands. Annihilus easily threw Phyla away, but offered an alternate choice the Quantum Bands chose Phyla and left Annihilus for her. Weakened, Nova killed Annihilus by reaching inside his throat and ripping out his insides.</p><p>In the wake of the Annihilation, there is much to rebuild. The once mighty Kree empire is left with its defenses crippled, and the Supreme Intelligence is now dead. The Kree now fall under the leadership of Ronin. Phyla-Vell now possesses the Quantum Bands and has taken over Wendell Vaughn's place as the new Quasar. The Silver Surfer has become Galactus' herald once again along with Stardust, both being needed to quench Galactus' now insatiable hunger. Quill is in charge of helping to rebuild the Kree defense networks. Choosing to forgo rebuilding the Nova Corps until later, Richard Rider still possesses the full power of the Nova Corps and is flying from world to world attempting to answer distress calls from all corners of the universe. Despite Annihilus' death his remaining broken forces are now spread throughout the galaxy. Many generals from the Annihilation Wave are now ruling over their own planets as a result of the treaty struck between Ronan's Kree empire and the remainder of Annihilus' army.

    "description": "<h2>Plot SummaryÂ </h2><p>While locked up in the Slab penitentiary, the Joker finds he has a terminal brain tumor. Determined to go out with a bang, he uses a venom to \"jokerize\" other inmates, making them insane and bear a physical resemblance to his own white skin, green hair, and wide smile. A riot breaks out in the Slab and Black Canary, Nightwing, and Batman move in to put it down while Dina Bell and Shilo Norman are trapped inside. The Joker prompts Black Mass to suck the prison into a black hole while he and the other villains escape. Blue Beetle narrowly rescues Black Canary, Batman, and Nightwing while Dina and Shilo are not as lucky. Barbara Gordon feels remorseful for being absent on a date with Dick Grayson (Nightwing) while the riot first broke out and begins to wish she could kill the Joker for the pain he's caused in her life.</p> <p>Chaos soon spreads throughout the entire DC Universe and war is declared against the Joker by President Lex Luthor. While JLA searches for him, the Joker hides out on Easter Island and sends his minions to capture Harley Quinn so he can impregnate her and produce an heir. Harley is eventually rescued by Spoiler, Batgirl, and Power Girl. Harley is upset that the Joker had tried to do this without marrying her first.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Joker grows disgruntled at the lack of creativity behind his minions' havoc, realizing that \"every other crisis\" involves red skies and crazy weather. With the assistance of Stormfront and Mr. 104, the Joker poisons the atmosphere and creates \"crazy rain\", spreading his laughing toxin across the world. His next plan is the assassination of President Luthor.</p> <p>While the \"jokerized\" villains are being rounded up, Kirk Langstrom discovers that the venom they are affected with is also deadly and works to produce an antidote with the reluctant help of Harley Quinn. Black Canary also discovers that the Joker's CAT scans were modified and that doctors lied to him about his death with the hope that it would cause him to lead a more sane life.</p> <p>Inside the Slab, Shilo and Dina are struggling to find a way to get themselves and the prison back to earth. They initially try to find Black Mass to reverse the gravity well with the help of Mister Mind, however Dina accidentally shoots Black Mass during a run-in with the Maneaters. They eventually resort to killing Multi-Man over and over until he is able to reanimate Black Mass who then sends them back to earth.</p> <p>Huntress is sent to Arkham Asylum to find Robin, who disappeared into the building and stopped sending out reports. After encountering Killer Croc, she finds what appears to be Robin's remains. Nightwing, enraged over Robin's death, goes to face the Joker one-on-one and beats him to near-death until the Bat family, Robin included, arrives on the scene much to Nightwing's surprise. The Joker is revived and returned to prison where he is put in a windowless, doorless cell (with out an audience to entertain. The jokerized villains are finally returned to their normal selves and all is well, until the next crisis that is.Â <br/></p><h2>Collected Edition</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-32211\" href=\"/batman-the-jokers-last-laugh/4050-32211/\" slug=\"batman-the-jokers-last-laugh\">Batman: The Joker's Last Laugh</a></li></ul>",

During the brief moments she was brought back, <a href=\"/belasco/4005-10947/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10947\"> Belasco</a> sensed her presence and tried to summon her to him in <a href=\"/limbo/4020-42990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\"> Limbo</a>.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The Skrull are invading Earth. Key figures within the Marvel Universe may have been replaced by Skrull sleeper agents. A possible Skrull invasion is on the horizon, whose seeds were planted during the Kree/Skrull war. The question is who do you trust?</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p>The <a href=\"/secret-avengers/4060-40904/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40904\">Secret Avengers</a> remain in hiding after the conclusion of the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>.

Cage was skeptical of his alive-again teammate, but decided to allow him to join. When the team heard that <a href=\"/ronin/4005-41928/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41928\">Ronin</a> was captured by <a href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\">The Hand</a> under the rule of <a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra</a>, the New Avengers flew to Japan to rescue her. Maya had been in Japan keeping tabs on Elektra and the hand as well as the <a href=\"/silver-samurai/4005-3174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3174\">Silver Samurai</a>, hoping to try to solve the conflicts between the Hand and the Clan Yashida. Maya was killed, and resurrected by the Hand (as is their normal routine) with the intention of making her an assassin.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/259395-49456-elektra.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-259395\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.9525\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/259395-49456-elektra.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-259395\"><img alt=\"Skrull Elektra\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/259395-49456-elektra.gif\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/259395-49456-elektra.gif 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Skrull Elektra</figcaption></figure><p>When the Secret Avengers reached Japan they engaged in a fight with Elektra and the Hand. Brainwashed by the Hand, Maya initially fought on the side of the Hand, resulting in Doctor Strange getting stabbed. At the end of the battle Maya turned on the hand, stabbing Elektra through the stomach. As Elektra died her features shifted into that of a <a href=\"/skrull/4015-43139/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43139\">Skrull</a>.</p><p>The team takes the body back to the United States with them. The flight back is ominous, each of them examining the reasons behind the appearance of this Skrull, and its intention (the intentions of the Skrulls are typically not good). Serious questions begin to be raised. Who among the Earth's population is actually a Skrull? Who among their very ranks could be a Skrull? Is this an isolated incident, or is there something more sinister at work? The skills and magic of the Hand, the powerful magics of Doctor Strange, Spider-Man's Spidey Sense, and even Wolverine's enhanced senses were all unable to detect that this Skrull was not actually Elektra. Spider-Woman suggests that this runs even deeper and that the Skrulls may have orchestrated events which have recently damaged the relationship and credibility within the Earth's Superhero community, specifically the events of the Civil War may have been triggered by the Skrulls. Spider-Woman wonders if <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> could have been replaced by a Skrull, explaining his behavior during the Civil War. She expresses the desire to her teammates to take the Skrull body directly to Iron Man to determine by his reaction if he is a Skrull or not.</p><p>Other members of the team do not like this plan, but they have little time to debate. For unknown reasons, while flying back over the States their plane begins to lose altitude. Knowing that she can fly, Wolverine throws Spider-Woman out of the plane to attempt to balance the load. The plane goes down and crashes. Spider-Woman tries to get to the Skrull body to take it to Stark, but Wolverine cuts her off. She knocks him out with a powerful venom blast, and leaves with the Skrull corpse for Stark Tower.</p><p>Spider-Woman presents the Skrull body to Tony Stark, who wishes to keep it secret for the time. He arranges for another meeting with the <a href=\"/illuminati/4060-40421/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40421\">Illuminati</a>, a powerful group of superheroes that had clandestinely steered major past events within the Marvel Universe. Not only had the heroes of Earth come into battle on several occasions with the Skrulls, the Illuminati had as well. They had initially formed after the Kree-Skrull War, and had threatened the Skrulls that any more attacks would start a war. The members were even taken prisoner by the Skrulls and studied individually. They were able to escape back to Earth.</p><p>Iron Man brought the Skrull body to the Illuminati meeting. <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>, Iron Man, <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, and <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a> were all present. Along with the a fore mentioned techniques and powers that the Skrull were able to evade, Iron Man also noted that its Skrull origin was completely undetectable to his own technology. He also notes to the group that this infiltration may have been a result of what they had done to the Skrull Empire when they had initially formed. Before they could decide what to do Black Bolt reveals to the others that he was a Skrull and launches an attack. The Skrull Black Bolt uses Black Bolt's power against Namor and unleashes a powerful scream. Namor is able to kill the Skrull, but before the team can recover two more arrive. One seemingly has the powers of the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>'s <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a> while the other is a copy of <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>. Doctor Strange is able to teleport the team to safety, and Iron Man blows up the remaining two Skrulls. Professor Xavier identified during the battle that the Skrull Black Bolt was also able undetected by Professor Xavier's telepathy. The team departs once again, not knowing who they can trust.</p><h3>Invasion</h3><p>Tony Stark has to figure out how to handle this secret invasion. He summons Medusa and Crystal and talks to them with the Black Bolt Skrull corpse in between. Medusa demands an explanation, Tony not knowing much about himself all he tells them is that an invasion is rising and problems will arrive. Medusa then takes the body and leaves to the moon.</p><p>Stark arranges for Mr. Fantastic and <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a> to study the Skrull-Elektra body at a secret Stark Laboratory. He doesn't know who he can trust, even the Richards or Pym, and he must discover why the Skrulls are completely undetectable to psychics, technology, magic, and enhanced senses, and any other ability. Hank and Reed begin work to uncover the Skrull secrets.</p><p>Meanwhile on the <a href=\"/sword/4060-41666/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41666\">SWORD</a> satellite headquarters known as The Peak, commanding officer <a href=\"/dum-dum-dugan/4005-3526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> and recently arrived Agent <a href=\"/abigail-brand/4005-4441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4441\">Abigail Brand</a> witness an unidentified Skrull transport spacecraft entering Earth's atmosphere and about to crash-land in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a>. They contact Stark, who leaves Richards and Pym to work on the Skrull body to determine how they are both completely undetectable and able to copy the powers of Earth's superheroes. Stark flies off to locate the other members of the <a href=\"/mighty-avengers/4060-46148/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46148\">Mighty Avengers</a> to investigate the crash site.</p><p>Susan Richards had been in Vancouver in a conference. There she was surprised by her husband Reed. She later discovered that he was a Skrull and he was there to capture the Invisible Woman using powers like her.</p><p>Medusa arrives to the Inhumans with the Skrull corpse and suggests that the Inhumans take care of this matter. The Inhuman king raises the question of who can be trusted. Crystal then doubts if maybe Iron man was right about a war coming and problems arising.</p><p>While Stark is attempting to arrange for the Mighty Avengers to all meet for the flight, <a href=\"/spider-woman/4005-1453/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1453\">Spider-Woman</a> contacts the Secret Avengers to let them know that they can get there before Stark can. Cage calls <a href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\">Cloak</a> for a favor, and has him teleport the group to the Avengers tower to take the Avengers <a href=\"/quinjet/4055-41412/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41412\">Quinjet</a>. Only <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a> was there at the time, and the team is easily able to take her down. With a mode of transportation, they fly for the Savage Land.</p><p>Once in the Savage Land, the Quinjet is damaged by a dinosaur, and crash lands in the top of a tree. The group exits and notices that the building where they had their first battle as the Avengers was destroyed. Next they come upon the crash-landed Skrull craft. Before they get a chance to open it, Iron Man and the Mighty Avengers arrive. In direct defiance to Stark's wishes, Cage rips the door off of the Skrull craft. A light on the craft turns from red to green, and Skrull sleeper agents around the world are activated.</p><p>On The Peak, Dugan's eyes glow green and he says \"He loves you...\" before he detonates the space station. From the Avengers Tower, <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Jarvis</a> uploads a Skrull Virus into Stark's armor causing it to go haywire, and also says \"He loves you...\". Using Stark's Extremis link to the world's satellite system, the virus takes control of the <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> <a href=\"/helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\">Helicarrier</a> which begins to go down. Systems in Stark enterprises plants, Stark satellites orbiting the planet, and the maximum security prison for superhumans known as <a href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">The Raft</a> are each compromised. Prisoners within The Raft are able to escape once again. Another maximum security penitentiary known as the <a href=\"/the-cube/4020-41062/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41062\">The Cube</a> is also under siege by its inmates. There is an explosion at Thunderbolts Mountain as someone who appears to be <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Captain Marvel</a> arrives. At the public headquarters of the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, a Skrull version of the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> sets off a <a href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\">The Negative Zone</a> gateway which sucks half of the tower into the Negative Zone.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7495/419626-Secret_Invasion_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-419626\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.77107364685004\" data-width=\"1127\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1127px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7495/419626-Secret_Invasion_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-419626\"><img alt=\"Heroes\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7495/419626-Secret_Invasion_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7495/419626-Secret_Invasion_02.jpg 1127w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7495/419626-Secret_Invasion_02.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7495/419626-Secret_Invasion_02.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Heroes</figcaption></figure><p>Back in the savage land, individuals purporting to be several of Earth's superheroes emerge from the Skrull ship. These heroes were: Spider-Man, Luke Cage, Phoenix, Emma Frost, Beast, Mockingbird, Captain America, Hawkeye, Wolverine, Thor, Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, Ms. Marvel, Invisible Woman and Vision. Wanting to know who the members of the two teams of Avengers are. Back at the Stark Industries secret location, Reed Richards finally discovers the way that the Skrulls were able to make themselves undetectable. He is about to share this information with Hank Pym who takes out a Skrull weapon and fires at Richards, causing him to lose control of his elastic powers and sending his body all over the room. This Pym impostor changes into a Skrull and tells Richards that \"He even loves you\".</p><p>While in the Savage Land the heroes that came out of the ship and the Avengers (and Secret Avengers) face each other. Ares makes note that this is only to distract them but they still face off in an epic battle. While they all fight the Avenger Ms. Marvel took the injured Tony out of the battle field. The Sentry tries to talk to Vision but the Vision transforms into his \"evil self\" and blames him for these events. Ronin then takes Hawkeye's bow and arrow and shoots Beast, Emma Frost and tries to shoot Captain America but fails. Cap was able to shield his attack making Hawkeye doubt if he really is Steve Rogers. Then a T-Rex arrives into the scene and kills two of the Spider-Man and Hawkeye from the Skrull ship. Carol takes Shell Head to the base where the New Avengers first joined forces and Iron Man then said he was going to make another Iron Man suit from the material he had around and sent Danvers to the mainland. Luke Cage and Wolverine see the dead Spidey and conclude that all of the heroes from the ship are Skrulls. The they see Mockingbird crying over the death of the Hawkeye Skrull. She claimed to be the real thing and before Wolverine can hurt her Ronin stops him. He asks her what happened on October 12th. She answers: \"I-I had a miscarriage. We didn't tell anyone. Me and my husband. We figured his birthday would have been October 12th\". This proves to Clint that she is in fact the real deal. They kiss and Ronin tell Wolverine to trust him. Mockingbird mentions that she thinks that Captain America is also the real deal since he's the one who brought them back to earth.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15530/381810-58596-secret-invasion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381810\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.775\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15530/381810-58596-secret-invasion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381810\"><img alt=\"The Invasion begins\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15530/381810-58596-secret-invasion.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15530/381810-58596-secret-invasion.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Invasion begins\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15530/381810-58596-secret-invasion.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15530/381810-58596-secret-invasion.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Invasion begins</figcaption></figure><p>Back in Manhattan the Young Avengers watch as the Baxter Building eats itself up.

The heroes attack the Skrulls constantly. Nick Fury and Norman Osborn remark that the other should be in jail, Captain America and Natasha Romanoff go in for an offensive attack, and Iron Man is holding his armor with rubber bands.

Wolverine attempts to attack Veranke, only to have his skin burn off by her venom blasts. Then Uatu, the Watcher shows up.

He takes out three Super-Skrulls and then shoots an arrow through Veranke's neck, exiting through her cheek. Although it seems she's dead, she's not. However Crito-Noll activates the formula he gave the Wasp several days ago and she begins to grow large. Skrull Jarvis then states that it doesn't matter if the Skrulls live or die just as long as 'God's' will is done. Janet begins to emit purple energy and entraps the heroes, villains and Skrulls in the energy.</p><p>Janet Pym is now the massive weapon that no one will survive. Thor pops in and makes her disappear just while dying. The Skrull Queen is still alive and as she is about to be killed by Wolverine, Norman Osborn gets the kill shot. The shot would become \"the shot heard 'round the world' due to all news networks covering the event. Iron Man and Thor go into space and take down a Skrull ship which uncovers all of the replaced people by Skrulls. Including Spider-Woman, Invisible Woman, Yellowjacket and Jarvis which makes Jessica Jones realize her baby is with a Skrull. When she goes back she can't find the baby nor the Skrull. Nick Fury leaves in a hurry when Dugan wanted to say hi.</p><p>The president, after this, takes down SHIELD and makes Norman Osborn leader of the Thunderbolts initiative leaving all of SHIELD's old responsibilities to him.

    "deck": "After Doom ambushes the Fantastic Four in a devastating attack on the family, kidnapping Franklin and Valeria, the team makes sure the now vanquished Doom, hurts no one else and head to Latveria.",
    "description": "<p>\"Authoritative Action,\" takes place directly after the \"Unthinkable\" Story Arc in the main Fantastic Four book. After returning his family to their home after the ghastly events they had to endure because of <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>. Reed felt guilty and wanted nothing more than to protect his family at all costs. His face now disfigured and his spirit broken he decided to make sure that Doom could hurt no one else if ever returned from Hell. Taking advice for Johnny to let out some aggression on Doom on a past self, he steals a lock of Doom's hair only to return to the regular timeline and begin his work</p><p>At first his work seems to be obsessive but we eventually find out that Reed had been using Doom's hairs a means to tweak his DNA and allow the team access to his castle in Latveria. He convinces the rest of the group to come to Latveria without ever revealing his true purposes. Upon reaching the sovereign nation, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, are immediately harassed by the populace and with good reason. For most of his tenure as the monarch of Latveria, he had been feeding his people lies about his arch-enemies, and now seeing them in the flesh caused anger and resentment.</p><p>The team ignored them and headed to Castle Doom, where Reed did the unthinkable. Taking off his Fantastic Four suit shirt, he placed it on a flagpole and thus claimed Latveria his own. The team was aghast even if they never outright said it. During their time in the castle, the team made sure to deactivate and destroy most of Doom's weaponry's fearing that if another person or country got their hands on it, the results would be disastrous.</p><p>At the same time S.H.I.E.L.D and the government were getting word of this supposed coup that involve the Fantastic Four and sent messages to Reed to leave or it would be seen as treachery. Reed ignored the messages, and hid them from his teammates as they slowly brought to light all of Dooms horrors into the Latveria. The people were horrified and slowly they began to accept the Fantastic Four. They treated them with respect and wanted nothing more than for them to be independent and for the first time in a long time the Latverians could breathe easily.</p><p>However, as a result of Reed constantly ignoring the messages from SHIELD and the UN, both organizations were forced to act upon this seeming treachory. However Nick Fury tried to preempt the actions for as long as he could. Unfortunately, they didn't have enough time and Nick was forced to send his men in to take down the Fantastic Four as traitors. Reed finally came clean with the team and told them of the impending plan to strike them with missiles and he convinced the team to leave.</p><p>In reality, Reed had been constructing a prison for Doom, to make sure he would never escape and hurt his family. In order to do that however, he'd had to sacrifice his family and stay with Doom in the makeshift prison. Reed said it best, Reed would be Warden and Doom would be prisoner. But things didn't go as planned. The rest of the team caught up to Nick Fury who told them the truth and the team hurried back to the castle to try to stop or help Reed. Before the portal could close the image of Sue, Johnny, and Ben are seen and Doom takes his chance to escape.</p><p>He transferred his soul into the Invisible Woman taking over her powers, even remarking on how he always knew Sue was the most powerful of the team, and he carried out a devastating attack using her powers, killing SHIELD agents. Nick Fury had seen it all so he knew it wasn't Sue's doing. When Johnny got close enough to Sue, he switch between the two and took control over Johnny, before finally taking over Ben, determined to use his brute strength to bring down everyone in sight. Ben managed to come back long enough to beg Reed to kill him, with tears in his eyes And with reluctance Reed accepted, mortally wounding his best friend in the process. The next stories would lead into the \"Hereafter Arc.\"</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/fantastic-four-authoritative-action/4050-38751/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38751\">Fantastic Four: Authoritative Action</a></li><li><a href=\"/fantastic-four-by-mark-waid-2-volume-two/4000-261474/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-261474\">Fantastic Four by Mark Waid Vol. 2</a></li><li><a href=\"/fantastic-four-by-waid-and-wieringo-ultimate-colle/4000-297558/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-297558\">Fantastic Four by Waid and Wieringo Ultimate Collection Book Three</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/los-4-fantasticos-17/4000-290774/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290774\">Los 4 FantÃ¡sticos #17</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/los-4-fantasticos-18/4000-290776/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290776\">Los 4 FantÃ¡sticos #18</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/los-4-fantasticos-19/4000-290778/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290778\">Los 4 FantÃ¡sticos #19</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/los-4-fantasticos-20/4000-290780/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-290780\">Los 4 FantÃ¡sticos #20</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

    "deck": "Doom captures Franklin and Valeria after a sudden attack on the team. Now the Fantastic Four must travel to Latveria to save them. The ramifications of this would have lasting effects on the team.",
    "description": "<p>The first arc to follow Waid's \"Imaginauts\" arc was the \"Unthinkable\" arc. This arc would pave the way for the next two crucial arcs, in this triple threat, <a data-ref-id=\"4045-47419\" href=\"/authoritative-action/4045-47419/\" slug=\"authoritative-action\">Authoritative Action</a>\" and the \"Hereafter Arc\" all in the main Fantastic Four comic. </p><p>\"Unthinkable\" deals with the ramifications of Doom's delivery of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2470\" href=\"/valeria-richards/4005-2470/\" slug=\"valeria-richards\">Valeria Richards. </a>Unknown to the team, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">Doctor Doom</a> used the opportunity to cast a spell on the baby to make her into his magical familiar. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\" href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" slug=\"fantastic-four\">Fantastic Four</a> had no idea of this until Valeria seemingly spoke her first word, \"Doom\".  In that instance Doom carried out a devastating blow on the team. A trio of demons, whom Doom made a deal with, kidnapped <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\" href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" slug=\"franklin-richards\">Franklin </a>and took him to hell.</p><p>In the struggle, both Reed and Johnny tried in vain to rescue Franklin but the demons were too powerful. They sent a barrage of demon fire towards the Human Torch and thus burnt him in the process. A surprised Johnny exclaiming how he'd never been burnt since he got his powers. At the same time, Sue and Ben were rushing towards Reed's lab to tell him of what just happened to Valeria, then learn what happened to Franklin. Understandably distraught and seeing a connection between Valeria's first word and the sudden attack they deduce that Doom was behind the attacks.</p><p>They travel to Latveria hoping to find Franklin and fix what was wrong with Valeria. As they headed into Latveria Doom had placed several Doombots and copies of himself, to trick the team. The Doombots were easily taken care of. When Sue finally thought she'd gotten Doom, she attacked him with a devastating attack, only to realize too late it wasn't the right Doom. Doom was hiding and finally made himself known. He cast his magic on the team and then teleports baby Valeria into his arms, seemingly winning this encounter with the team.</p><p>He takes them back to his castle where he uses his magic to have the team suffer through painful versions of their team member's powers, and trying to demoralize them in a different way. He gave Johnny, Reed's signature stretching powers and tried stretching him to his limits. At the same time, he gave Sue a painful version of Johnny's flame power. Ben was forced to fight monster after monster. But he left the most \"cruel\" fate for Reed. Both Doom and Reed realized that Reed's understanding of magic has always been flawed. So Doom stuck him in a library filled only with magical literature making Reed feel useless.</p><p>As Reed sits in the room one of the magical books topples over and he notices a message written in flames that says \"Science is everything.\" He opened the book to find the astral projection of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\" href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" slug=\"doctor-strange\">Doctor Strange</a> who had been imprisoned by Doom. Together, Dr. Strange tried in vain to teach Reed magic. To help understand and let go of his analytical mind while practicing magic. Reed feeling useless, was going to give up until he realized something that would help him develop a bit of innate magical abilities. He swallows his pride and admits not to understand it and he uses that to fuel him. He manages to escape and returns to Castle Doom. He defeats Doom and rescues his teammates. </p><p>The team quickly hurries to find Franklin, seeing him in Hell in the middle of the group of demons who had taken him. Franklin had escaped momentarily before but had been found again. The team battled the demons, and later find that Doom hadn't been completely defeated. Once again, Reed puts an end to Doom, this time the Demon taking possession of Doom for the fact that he didn't come through with his part of the deal (delivering Franklin) and he's thrust into Hell. But before he leaves, he badly scars Reed's face. <br/></p><p>This arc would led into the actions of the next arc, \"<a data-ref-id=\"4045-47419\" href=\"/authoritative-action/4045-47419/\" slug=\"authoritative-action\">Authoritative Action</a>\".</p>",

    "description": "<p>Defiant is the first story arc of New Warrors vol. 4, running from issues 1-6.  It deals with the reemergence of the underground superhero team New Warriors in the public eye.  The former team had been infamously immortalized as the \"baby killers\" of Stamford, Connecticut, where a mismatched pursuit led to the death of many innocent civilians and all but one of the team's members as well.</p><p>This incarnation of the New Warriors are active protesters of the Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA) and the man who is spearheading the campaign, Tony Stark.  The team, made up of mutants who were depowered on <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\" href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" slug=\"m-day\">M-Day</a>, are a mystery to the public at large as well as to each other.  This arc unravels the identity of Night Thrasher, who was believed to be killed in the Stamford tragedy as well as the new identities of some notable former mutants, including former X-Men Jubilee (now going by Wondra) and Chamber (now known as Decibel).</p><p>The group also tries to recruit former New X-Man Sofia Mantega (formerly known as Wind Dancer), though their attempts are unsuccessful as the very cautious teen is weary of committing to a new family after being tore from her former life after the events of M-Day.</p><p>When the group encounters the Zodiac, an inadequately trained member falls prey to inexperience.  While the team is down and out, Sofia Mantega offers a distraction for the group to gain an upperhand and to save a young boy caught in the crossfire.  However, she is shot from behind by one of the Zodiac's members and is severely injured.</p><p>As the team begins to dismantle due to their failures, Sofia reemerges from her recovery to bring the group together for a chance at solidarity and companionship.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Chapter One:Coffin</h2><p>The story opens with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4437\" href=\"/elongated-man/4005-4437/\" slug=\"elongated-man\">Elongated Man</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3418\" href=\"/firehawk/4005-3418/\" slug=\"firehawk\">Firehawk</a> on stakeout while waiting for criminals to show up. Firehawk asks Elongated Man how he met his <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1790\" href=\"/sue-dibny/4005-1790/\" slug=\"sue-dibny\">wife</a>, prompting Elongated Man then tells the tale. Ralph mentions how for each of his upcoming birthdays, Sue would give him a surprise mystery which Ralph would have to solve. While in truth he was always able to solve every mystery, he pretended he couldn't to make his wife happy. Meanwhile, Sue is wrapping Ralph's birthday present; inside is a positive pregnancy test that shows she's positive. All of a sudden, she hears a noise and thinking its <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\" href=\"/green-arrow/4005-5936/\" slug=\"green-arrow\">Ollie</a>. She goes to inspect it. Back at the stakeout, the villain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5932\" href=\"/bolt/4005-5932/\" slug=\"bolt\">Bolt</a> appears and a shoot out ensues between him and the sellers. Before Ralph and Firehawk can intervene, Ralph receives an emergency call from Sue and rushes home. Unfortunately, he is too late and finds Sue's burnt corpse in the rain. Ralph's body begins to slump as he holds his wife in his arms as he cries. An hour later, Green Arrow and his son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14257\" href=\"/connor-hawke/4005-14257/\" slug=\"connor-hawke\">Connor Hawke</a> are having a sparring match while being coached by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\" href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" slug=\"justice-society-of-america\">Justice Society</a>-member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7645\" href=\"/wildcat/4005-7645/\" slug=\"wildcat\">Wildcat</a>. Connor is able to land a punch on Ollie that was so fast Ollie could barely see it, making him proud of his son. The moment is interrupted by Conner's com link spreading the news of Sue's death. At the same time, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\" href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" slug=\"tim-drake\">Tim Drake</a> returns from a mission as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\" href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" slug=\"robin\">Robin</a> and is greeted by his <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6852\" href=\"/jack-drake/4005-6852/\" slug=\"jack-drake\">father</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420872-sue dibny.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-420872\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.174025974026\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420872-sue dibny.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-420872\"><img alt=\"Ralph holds his wife\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420872-sue+dibny.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420872-sue+dibny.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" data-width=\"385\"></a><figcaption>Ralph holds his wife</figcaption></figure><p>who tells Tim he was worried.The two then overhear the news that Sue Dibny has been murdered. Four hours later, Green Arrow arrives at the crime scene and discovers that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" slug=\"batman\">Batman</a> has already checked but found nothing. Ollie brings in other heroes to help investigate the area such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5703\" href=\"/mr-miracle/4005-5703/\" slug=\"mr-miracle\">Mr.Miracle</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22707\" href=\"/animal-man/4005-22707/\" slug=\"animal-man\">Animal Man</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-34685\" href=\"/ray-palmer/4005-34685/\" slug=\"ray-palmer\">the Atom</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-5712\" href=\"/metal-men/4060-5712/\" slug=\"metal-men\">Metal Men</a>. 48 hours later, the superheroes gather at Sue Dibny's funeral. Ralph attempts to make a speech, but cannot bring himself to do it and literally cannot hold himself together. The next speaker is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" slug=\"wonder-woman\">Diana</a> and after she's done all the heroes leave to find somebody on a suspect list. After all the heroes have left, Green Arrow, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\" href=\"/zatanna/4005-5691/\" slug=\"zatanna\">Zatanna</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1689\" href=\"/black-canary/4005-1689/\" slug=\"black-canary\">Black Canary</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8337\" href=\"/hawkman/4005-8337/\" slug=\"hawkman\">Hawkman</a> and the Atom meet with Ralph. Ralph turns to them with a face of great anger and says</p><p>\"Help me find Dr.Light!!\".</p><h2>Chapter Two:House of Lies</h2><p>Nine minutes before the present time, Ray Palmer meets with his ex-wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22036\" href=\"/jean-loring/4005-22036/\" slug=\"jean-loring\">Jean Loring</a>, Ray gives Jean a crossbow that once belonged to Hawkman in order for her to protect herself after Sue Dibny's recent murder. Following where the heroes left of at the previous chapter, Ralph Dibny, aka Elongated Man, is getting ready with the others to capture <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3583\" href=\"/dr-light/4005-3583/\" slug=\"dr-light\">Dr. Light</a>, who is suspected for the murder of Sue Dibny. Before they can leave, Hawkman finds out that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\" href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" slug=\"kyle-rayner\">Kyle Rayner</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\" href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\" slug=\"wally-west\">Wally West</a> are secretly listening to their conversation and the two heroes confront the others for their secrecy pertaining to Dr.Light. The heroes are reluctant to say anything until Wally threatens to bring in Batman and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a>. With this, Ralph tells Wally and Kyle as the heroes go in pursuit of Dr.Light that once, the villain Dr.Light had teleported into their <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41469\" href=\"/justice-league-watchtower/4020-41469/\" slug=\"justice-league-watchtower\">Watchtower</a> on the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42072\" href=\"/the-moon/4020-42072/\" slug=\"the-moon\">Moon</a> while the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">Justice League</a> was out fighting <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10210\" href=\"/hector-hammond/4005-10210/\" slug=\"hector-hammond\">Hector Hammond</a>. Instead of finding the League, Light found Sue Dibny and blinded her eyes with his powers and proceeded to rape her. The Justice League arrive and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\" href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" slug=\"barry-allen\">Barry</a> is the first to attack Light, the other heroes attacking soon after. Light is taken down by Elongated Man who hits him with Hawkman's mace after seeing what he did to his wife. Upon hearing this story, Wally is shocked as Dr.Light always seemed a moron when fought during Wally's time as a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\" href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" slug=\"teen-titans\">Teen Titan</a>. Green Arrow then reveals that there is a reason for that. Meanwhile, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2532\" href=\"/merlyn/4005-2532/\" slug=\"merlyn\">Merlyn</a> arrives at a meeting point for the supervillains. All of a sudden, a frightened Dr.Light teleports in and begs to hire somebody. Elsewhere, Green Arrow reveals that the team took a vote to mindwipe Dr.Light, as he threatened that he would go after Sue again. Green Arrow, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\" href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" slug=\"hal-jordan\">Hal Jordan</a>, and Black Canary had voted against and Zatanna, Hawkman, and Atom voted for it. The vote came down to Barry Allen who voted for it, being a particularly sore subject as less than six months before, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9977\" href=\"/iris-allen-west/4005-9977/\" slug=\"iris-allen-west\">Iris</a> had died. The story is interrupted by Dr.Light who teleports into the building. Ralph is the first to confront him, but is caught in an explosion caused by Dr.Light's hired assassin <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3588\" href=\"/deathstroke/4005-3588/\" slug=\"deathstroke\">Deathstroke</a>, the Terminator. Elsewhere, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47757\" href=\"/doctor-midnight/4005-47757/\" slug=\"doctor-midnight\">Dr. Midnight</a> is finished with the autopsy of Sue Dibny and concludes that the murderer was not Dr. Light.</p><h2>Chapter Three:Serial Killer</h2><p>The heroes' plan to capture Dr.Light has become more difficult as Light has hired Deathstroke to protect him. Flash is the first to attack Deathstroke, but the assassin activates bombs planted around him forcing Flash to attack him from behind. Deathstroke sees this coming and stabs the speedster, twisting the blade, so Flash is to wounded to get up.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/987491-262092_165881_deathstroke_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-987491\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1808118081181\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/987491-262092_165881_deathstroke_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-987491\"><img alt=\"Protected by the Terminator\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/987491-262092_165881_deathstroke_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/987491-262092_165881_deathstroke_super.jpg 271w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px\" data-width=\"271\"></a><figcaption>Protected by the Terminator</figcaption></figure><p>Deathstroke then attacks Zatanna by hitting her below her ribcage causing her to continuously vomit and prevent her from casting any spells. Hawkman is next to attack Deathstroke, but Deathstroke simply back flips over him, cutting off his wingstraps causing Hawkman to hit the ground hard. Green Arrow takes his shot at Deathstroke, but the assassain deflects the arrows with his sword and cuts the tips of the remaining arrows, making Green Arrow's arsenal useless. Black Canary attempts to use her sonic scream, but Deathstroke performs another flip over her as he wraps a bag over her head so that she cannot open her mouth or breath. Ollie attempts to help her while Deathstroke uses a laser pointer to hit a shrunken Atom. The pointers protons and electrons force him to grow back to normal and collide with a recovering Hawkman. Kyle Rayner is the last one standing, but before he can attack, Deathstroke breaks his fingers and attempts to use the ring for himself, but fails. Ollie, who doesn't want to take the chance, jumps behind Deathstroke and stabs him in his eye socket. Deathstroke loses his temper and punches Ollie, only to be jumped by the rest of the League. Upon seeing this brawl, Dr.Light is hit by a memory that reminds him of the mindwipe. In a fit of rage stemming from what he remembered, Light creates a big flash and gets away along with Deathstroke. After the battle is over, Superman arrives and asks what has happened, to which they tell him the lie that Ralph just wanted the first shot at Light. Meanwhile, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-29992\" href=\"/george-harkness/4005-29992/\" slug=\"george-harkness\">Captain Boomerang</a> talks to the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2545\" href=\"/calculator/4005-2545/\" slug=\"calculator\">Calculator</a> in order to find a job. The Calculator tells him that no one is willing to hire him anymore, since he became more and more of a joke. Simultaneously, Tim Drake returns to his home and his father sees the bruise on his face. As he goes to get some ice, he leaves Tim feeling guilty over the worry he puts his father through. Meanwhile, Jean Loring is attacked by an unknown assailant who ties a rope around her neck to hang her.</p><h2>Chapter Four: Who Benefits</h2><p>Jean Loring is being hung from her door. As she screams for help her ex-husband Ray Palmer, aka the Atom, arrives just in time to save her by riding through the phone lines and breaking the rope at microscopic size. As Jean lays unconscious, Ray, who is not a religious man, prays for the first time in a long time for Jean to be safe. Jean wakes up and opens her eyes to him saying \"Just like the old days\". Green Arrow, Mr.Miracle and Superman arrive at the apartment to investigate and Superman finds that the rope was tied in bowline knot. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\" href=\"/oracle/4005-5368/\" slug=\"oracle\">Oracle</a> investigates previous villains with that M.O and finds a villain named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4859\" href=\"/slipknot/4005-4859/\" slug=\"slipknot\">Slipknot</a> who is currently in prison.

Green Arrow is on patrol when he sees Deathstrokes reflection but when he turns around finds a note telling him that theyÂ´re not finished. Wally arrives to talk to Ollie revealing that during the fight with Light and Deathstroke he saw lights visions that involved the presence of Batman as well when Batman wasn't mentioned before this. Green Arrow reveals that Batman caught their mindwipe of Dr.Light and was outraged by this. Having no choice, the seven voted to mindwipe Batman as well. Wally upon hearing this is outraged and asks if Bruce knows this to which Ollie responds that \"Batman is a detective, he always has a clue\". Meanwhile, Batman tracks down the Calculator as he suspects that the Calculator sent Jack Drake the note. The Calculator reveals to Merlyn over the com that he did not send Captain Boomerang to his death but he doesn't know who did either and that he was played as well. Batman who discovers this then returns to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-31340\" href=\"/batcave/4020-31340/\" slug=\"batcave\">Batcave</a> to piece it all together.

As Jean smiles at him, Ray turns off the lights.</p><h2>Chapter Seven:The Hero's Life</h2><p>Dr. Midnight leaves the examining room where he tells Wildcat that he thinks Ray Palmer killed Sue Dibny, but Batman disagrees. Ray Palmer is with his wife Jean where the two are reliving their relationship. All of a sudden, Jean asks Ray if they found out who wrote that \"Protect yourself\" note to Jack Drake. Ray tells her that he doesnt know when it occurs to him that the information about the note was never revealed, meaning Jean couldn't have possibly known that there was a note. Ray begins to yell at Jean asking her how she knew about it in which she says she must have heared it on the news. Ray tells her he knows that sheÂ´s lying because Batman removed the note before anyone had even seen it. Ray then figures out what had happened. Jean used one of his old Atom costumes that he put away and used the power it contained to shrink down to subatomic size, explaining why there was no sign of any entry or clues as Jean Entered through the phone line.

She explained that she did not intend to kill her but scare everyone into thinking that someone was going after the heroes' loved ones and that Ray would come back to her. Jean later on used the suit to shrink down and hang herself to throw off suspicion which also led Ray to save her, which she was hoping for. Jean later revealed that killing Jack Drake was an accident. She hired a scrub assassin like Boomerang thinking that he would easily fail. She then sent Jack the gun hoping that he would kill Boomerang and the crime would be solved. Jean continues to defend her actions saying it was out of love for Ray and her wanting it to be \"like the old days\". Seeing Jeans face Ray realizes she is crazy and thus brings her to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\" href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" slug=\"arkham-asylum\">Arkham Asylum</a>. After admitting Jean, Ray shrinks down until he disappears as he cannot deal with the fact that he indirectly played a part in the murder of Sue Dibny and Jack Drake. The next few weeks continue as the heroes attempt to move on. Nobody has heard from Ray, Tim Drake has also disappeared as he is crying in bed over the loss of his father, Firehawk tells her father that she has quit being a superhero and Ollie tells Ralph that it helps if he talks to Sue because \"she can hear every word.\"</p><p>Ollie later meets with Wally, where Wally tells him he is still disturbed about them mindwiping Batman. Despite this, Wally tells Ollie that he would like to have dinner with him and Clark just like they used to do with Barry Allen in which Ollie agrees with a smile. The story then closes with Ralph who is about to go to bed, and talking to his wife as Ollie suggested. Ralph then turns of the lights and says \"Goodnight Sue....I love you too.\"</p><h2>Collected Edition</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-34002\" href=\"/identity-crisis/4050-34002/\" slug=\"identity-crisis\">Identity Crisis</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-44295\" href=\"/absolute-identity-crisis/4050-44295/\" slug=\"absolute-identity-crisis\">Absolute Identity Crisis</a> (DC 2011)</li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-32495\" href=\"/identity-crisis-1-special-edition/4050-32495/\" slug=\"identity-crisis-1-special-edition\">Identity Crisis Special Edition</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-155667\" href=\"/wizard-the-comics-magazine-/4000-155667/\" slug=\"wizard-the-comics-magazine-\">Wizard: The Comics Magazine #158</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284210\" href=\"/batman-superman-/4000-284210/\" slug=\"batman-superman-\">Batman &amp; Superman #1</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284211\" href=\"/batman-superman-/4000-284211/\" slug=\"batman-superman-\">Batman &amp; Superman #2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284212\" href=\"/batman-superman-/4000-284212/\" slug=\"batman-superman-\">Batman &amp; Superman #3</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284213\" href=\"/batman-superman-/4000-284213/\" slug=\"batman-superman-\">Batman &amp; Superman #4</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-286235\" href=\"/crise-de-identidade-/4000-286235/\" slug=\"crise-de-identidade-\">Crise de Identidade #1</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-286236\" href=\"/crise-de-identidade-/4000-286236/\" slug=\"crise-de-identidade-\">Crise de Identidade #2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-286237\" href=\"/crise-de-identidade-/4000-286237/\" slug=\"crise-de-identidade-\">Crise de Identidade #3</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-286238\" href=\"/crise-de-identidade-/4000-286238/\" slug=\"crise-de-identidade-\">Crise de Identidade #4</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-286239\" href=\"/crise-de-identidade-/4000-286239/\" slug=\"crise-de-identidade-\">Crise de Identidade #5</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-286240\" href=\"/crise-de-identidade-/4000-286240/\" slug=\"crise-de-identidade-\">Crise de Identidade #6</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-286241\" href=\"/crise-de-identidade-/4000-286241/\" slug=\"crise-de-identidade-\">Crise de Identidade #7</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289761\" href=\"/identity-crisis-/4000-289761/\" slug=\"identity-crisis-\">Identity Crisis #1</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289762\" href=\"/identity-crisis-/4000-289762/\" slug=\"identity-crisis-\">Identity Crisis #2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289763\" href=\"/identity-crisis-/4000-289763/\" slug=\"identity-crisis-\">Identity Crisis #3</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289764\" href=\"/identity-crisis-/4000-289764/\" slug=\"identity-crisis-\">Identity Crisis #4</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289765\" href=\"/identity-crisis-/4000-289765/\" slug=\"identity-crisis-\">Identity Crisis #5</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289766\" href=\"/identity-crisis-/4000-289766/\" slug=\"identity-crisis-\">Identity Crisis #6</a></li><li>Identity Crisis #7</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-290577\" href=\"/liga-da-justica-/4000-290577/\" slug=\"liga-da-justica-\">Liga da JustiÃ§a #38</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-290578\" href=\"/liga-da-justica-/4000-290578/\" slug=\"liga-da-justica-\">Liga da JustiÃ§a #39</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "In this event, Jim Starlin uses a God-Killer, as it is Jim Starlin's pleasure to kill off the New Gods that Jack Kirby created.",
    "description": "<p>These events unfold in an eight-issue limited series, <a href=\"../49-19262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Death of the New Gods</a> as well as other DC titles. Jim Starlin description of this project is as follows: \"I sort of think of this project as putting an ending to Jack's 'New Gods' saga. Since Kirby's initial run on the characters others have presented them with mixed results. Looking back I'd say at least half of the past New Gods series have done more harm than good. So for me, Death of the New Gods is half honoring Jack Kirby, half mercy killing.\"</p><p>He plans on killing them all, but one will survive and die a good death.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>On Earth, several of the <a href=\"../../new-gods/65-40647/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Gods</a>, including <a href=\"../../black-racer/29-10032/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Racer</a> and <a href=\"../../lightray/29-5317/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightray</a> are found dead with a bloody hole in their chests. Big Barda is soon among the victims, killed quickly in her kitchen while Scott is in the next room. An investigation by the Justice League into her death reveals very little, despite the best efforts of <a href=\"../../batman/29-1699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"../../green-lantern/12-41148/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Lantern</a> (<a href=\"../../hal-jordan/29-11202/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hal Jordan</a>) and <a href=\"../../zatanna/29-5691/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zatanna</a>. Mister MIracle darkens the colors of his costume to mourn his wife and travels with <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman</a> to New Genesis to bury Barda.</p><p>On arrival, they learn that the killer has been striking on New Genesis and that the current Highfather, <a href=\"../../takion/29-2364/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Takion</a>, has been mysteriously cut off from the source. Himon wishes to investigate the Source Wall, while Orion, believing that Darkseid is the culprit, wants to strike at Apokolips. Darkseid's minions, however, have also been victims of the god-killer. Superman warns Orion to wait for all the facts before accusing Darkseid. Orion interprets this as an insult to his honor and fights the Man of Steel. The fight, however, is short lived, as <a href=\"../../metron/29-3616/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metron</a> arrives, interrupting their melee. His investigation shows that it could not be Darkseid that was responsible, as he does not have the power to kill in such a fashion. Mister Miracle contemplates using the <a href=\"../../anti-life-equation/12-42524/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anti-Life Equation</a> to resurrect Barda, despite his vow to never use it. Superman overhears him discussing it with Orion, who then asks Superman to keep an eye on Miracle Man after he leaves.</p><p>The three then journey to Apokolips where they immediately battle Darkseid's forces. When they finally confronte him (without Superman, as he is unconscious), Darkseid tries to stop them with his partial knowledge of the Anti-Life Equation. Mister Miracle, however, has full knowledge and stops him. Darkseid then tells them that there is no hope and that he has come to terms with his inevitable death, as they should theirs.</p><p>On their return to New Genesis, they learn that Takion is dead, killed while he and Himon investigated the Source Wall. The next suspects are the <a href=\"../../forever-people/65-25939/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forever People</a>. However, when Superman, Orion and Mister Miracle arrive, they, too, are all dead, killed in the same manner as the others. Mister Miracle then uses the Anti-Life Equation, the first time in front of Superman, to reanimate their corpses to tell of their murder. While they tell of the circumstances of their deaths, they are unable to reveal the killer's identity. Their corpses then disintegrate under Mister Miracle's efforts to force them to reveal a name. Superman and Orion suspected that they had given one clue, that their visitor was the person they least expected. They reason this was the <a href=\"../../infinity-man/29-27485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinity Man</a>, as he only exists in this dimension by trading places with the Forever People. They do not inform Mister Miracle of their suspicions, as he becomes increasingly erratic.</p><p>New Genesis is then attacked by <a href=\"../../kalibak/29-4680/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kalibak</a> and <a href=\"../../mantis/29-13559/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mantis</a>. Mister Miracle is almost killed by Kalibak, but Superman and Orion manage to intervene. Mister Miracle is now convinced that Orion is the mysterious killer, and his sudden disappearance, as well as Kalibak's and Mantis's equally sudden deaths, appears to confirm it. Superman and an increasingly unstable Mister Miracle then go to confront Orion on an asteroid where he was seen waiting.</p><p>When they arrive, Mister Miracle allows the Anti-Life Equation to take over and attacks Orion and Superman. Orion, under the compulsion of the Anti-Life Equation, tells Mister Miracle that he was there acting as bait for the real killer. They tell Orion they would leave him to wait, but in reality they simply move to another part of the asteroid field to watch over Orion. Orion confronts the killer head on, but Superman and Mister Miracle are unable to see who it is. After the encounter, all that was left of Orion was his helmet. Mister Miracle and Superman then take Orion's helmet to the <a href=\"../../source-wall/34-42569/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source Wall</a>, where they discovere a second wall with the statues of those killed by the god-killer. Superman wonders why Himon has made no mention of it, when he appears behind them. Superman blasts him with his heat vision, revealing that it was, in fact, the Infinity Man, as he had suspected. Mister Miracle attacks as well, but the Infinity Man is powered by the <a href=\"../../the-source/12-48870/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a>. Superman is imprisoned by the Source and is forced to watch with Metron, who refuses to intervene. Mister Miracle ruptures the Source Wall in an effort to gain more power, but this allows the Source to combine with it's dark opposite, it's goal all along. Mister Miracle is no longer able to use the Anti-Life Equation and, with Metron, becomes the last victims of the Source's god killing.</p><p><b>A list of casualties:</b></p><ul><li><a

    "description": "<p>This event is not actually featured in any comic book, but was simply referred to in other Amalgam Comics.  It draws elements from the following comic book events: DC's Crisis on Infinite Earths and Zero Hour, and Marvel's Secret Wars and Infinity Gauntlet.</p><p>Often referred to simply as the \"Secret Crisis\", this is the greatest battle yet to take place in the Amalgam Universe. During this event, Thanoseid, along with Doctor Doomsday, sought to use the Infinity Links in order to obliterate all that was, save only Thanoseid's realm of Apokolips.</p><p>Thus, it was up to Amalgam's greatest heroes to stop them ,resulting in a climatic battle in Thanoseid's realm of Apokolips.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Background</h2><p>After suffering a psychotic break and destroying the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> created a new reality (referred to as the <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a>) where <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">Mutant</a> ruled and humans were the downtrodden minority. When this did not work, she reverted reality back, this time eliminating over 90% of the mutant population, turning them into humans.</p><p>Trying to find a way to undo what the Scarlet Witch had done to the mutant population, <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> embarked on a quest to discover how to restore the mutant <a href=\"/x-gene/4015-42328/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42328\">X-Gene</a> to those who lost their powers on <a href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\">M-Day</a>. He discovered that all traces of the X-Gene were eliminated from those individuals that lost their powers, including any samples of genetic material of de-powered. Adding to this failure, no mutants have been born since M-Day, making mutant kind an endangered species.</p><h2>Chapter 1</h2><p><a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a> locates the birth of a new <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">Mutant</a> in the small town of Cooperstown, Alaska. This birth marks a milestone because it is the first mutant child born since the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> de-powered over 90% of the worlds mutant population on <a href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\">M-Day</a>. The instant loss of millions of mutants made mutant kind an endangered species, the mutant <a href=\"/x-gene/4015-42328/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42328\">X-Gene</a> being \"erased\" from those who were de-powered (including all stored samples of mutant DNA), as well as no other mutant children having been born since.</p><p>The birth of the mutant occured while Professor X was discussing the mutant crisis with <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> and searching out all current mutants with <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a>. The psychic feedback resulting from the mutants birth overloaded both Professor X's brain as well as Cerebro, frying the powerful computer. It also caused a power surge within the mansion which caused all lights within the mansion to explode and power to be lost. An event of such importance would surely get the attention of others, and Xavier quickly gathered a small group of experienced X-Men to travel to Alaska in the <a href=\"/blackbird/4055-41920/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41920\">Blackbird</a>. The team consisted of <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a>, and <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>. When they arrived in Cooperstown they found the town burning and virtually all of its inhabitants either dead or wounded.</p><p>While trying to rescue the remaining inhabitants and piece together exactly what had transpired the X-Men found the dead bodies of several <a href=\"/purifiers/4060-14915/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14915\">Purifiers</a> as well as the shattered body of the <a href=\"/marauders/4060-40480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40480\">Marauder</a> <a href=\"/prism/4005-9736/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9736\">Prism</a>. Emma Frost scanned the mind of one of the survivors to discover that the Purafiers had been dispatched to kill all children of the town in order to make sure that they had killed the new mutant. Sinister's Marauders, including former X-Men <a href=\"/gambit/4005-1499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Gambit</a> and <a href=\"/sunfire/4005-3175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3175\">Sunfire</a> stopped the Purafiers and left to locate the new mutant. It was then that the X-Men learned that the new mutant was just born rather than a teenager. This confusion is expected as mutant powers typically manifest around puberty, not from birth. The X-Men departed Alaska to plan their next move, not knowing that the geneticaly-engineered mutant hunting monster <a href=\"/predator-x/4005-47143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47143\">Predator X</a> just arrived in Cooperstown. Predator X was created to hunt and feed upon powerful mutants, and it is hungy for the new child.</p><h2>Chapter 2</h2><p>Back at the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> Cyclops reminds Professor X who is now leading the X-Men, and puts Xavier to work with <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> to try to discover why the mutant's powers manifested at birth rather than as a teenager. Cyclops has already dispatched a small group of X-Men to locate a group of former <a href=\"/acolytes/4060-9730/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9730\">Acolytes</a> to try to discover the location of the Marauders and retrieve the mutant baby from them, and sent Emma Frost to retrieve <a href=\"/madrox/4005-7910/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7910\">Madrox</a>, <a href=\"/layla-miller/4005-1447/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1447\">Layla Miller</a>, and <a href=\"/rictor/4005-10988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10988\">Rictor</a> for their own missions. Having temporary erased Madrox's resentment towards the X-Men and desire not to work with them, Madrox and the others agreed to come along. Since losing his powers on M-Day, Rictor would scan as a normal human. For this reason Cyclops wants Rictor to infiltrate the Purifiers to determine their motivation. Madrox and Layla Miller are to locate <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\">Forge</a> for details on their own mission.</p><h2>Chapter 3</h2><p>Rictor employs the assistance of his team <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a> in order to make his way among the Purifier ranks. <a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Wolfsbane</a> attacks some members outside of one of their New York hideouts. The innocent human passerby Joaquin Murrieta (Rictor) happens upon the scene as Rahne is escaping, and fires several fake shots into her chest. Rahne escapes in the bed of <a href=\"/siryn/4005-3181/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3181\">Siryn</a>'s truck. Expressing a dislike of mutants, Rictor is invited in by one of the Purifiers who is impressed with how he handled himself. Inside Rictor is told to remain still at gunpoint while the guards scan him for mutant signatures. When he shows no signs of mutancy, the Purifiers invite him through a secret door, surprising Rictor with the size of one of their \"smaller\" weapons caches.</p><p>Meanwhile, Madrox and Layla Miller arrive at Forge's home to prepare for their mission. Forge had discovered that the problem mutants were experiencing was not limited to their own timeline, all other divergent timestreams and alternate futures that his machinery could access had shown that mutants have ceased to be. Since the birth of the new mutant two new timelines have emerged, and it was Madrox's job to create dupes to send to those futures for investigation. While Forge is sending the second dupe into the future, Layla rushes into the transport beam, sending both on a one-way trip. The original Madrox tries to fight Forge over what happened, but quickly falls unconscious.</p><p>Finally, having extracted information as to the location of <a href=\"/amelia-voght/4005-14868/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14868\">Amelia Voght</a>, the X-Men that were sent after the Acolytes traveled to the hospital that she worked at in Santa Cruz. In order to catch her by surprise, Wolverine stepped in front of a moving ambulance. With his healing factor having fixed most of his injuries by the time he got to the hospital, he catches Voght off guard and she turned into a living mist and tried to escape through a hospital vent. Storm caught her in a breeze, and prevented her from running away. The Acolytes had kept close ties with the Marauders, and of the remaining Acolytes she would know where to find them. Unhappily, Amelia provides them information on where they can find the Marauders.</p><h2>Chapter 4</h2><p>After sending two dupes to the future Jamie Madrox is still unconscious with brain functions working overtime. Forge explains what is happening to Cyclops, and becomes angry that Scott seems fine with sacraficing Madrox to discover what is going on. Cyclops contends that they are all dying out as mutant kind is becoming extinct.</p><p>The X-Men have traveled to Antarctica to locate the Marauders and the mutant baby. Knowing that the X-Men would soon figure out where they are, <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mr. Sinister</a> decided to step up their plans and vacate their Antarctic base. They are preparing to leave when the X-Men break into their base.</p><p><a href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\">Surge</a> discovers that the Purifiers were part of the attacks. She is angry that they have been left out of the loop and that the young team has been left out of the action. She decides that she is going to lead her team to attack the Purifiers and takes the information to them. Despite Cyclops desire to protect the team, the Purifiers have already killed many students of the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>, and they want to take out the Purifiers permanently. <a href=\"/hellion/4005-40454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40454\">Hellion</a>, <a href=\"/mercury/4005-15078/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15078\">Mercury</a>, <a href=\"/rockslide/4005-40456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40456\">Rockslide</a>, <a href=\"/anole/4005-40458/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40458\">Anole</a>, <a href=\"/pixie/4005-40673/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40673\">Pixie</a>, <a href=\"/prodigy/4005-40475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40475\">Prodigy</a>, <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a>, and <a href=\"/armor/4005-4442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4442\">Armor</a> agree to go along, but most decide to go primarily to help the mutant baby and not for Revenge. <a href=\"/dust/4005-4555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\">Dust</a> does not wish to go because she had seen too much bloodshed lately, and <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir</a> says that if he goes he would kill all of them, and so he also stays behind.</p><p>In the Washington Purafier base, Rictor is let in on their operations. He discovers that there are hundreds off churches and members located all over the globe. He discovers that the purifiers don't have the mutant baby and believes his mission to be over until he learns who the Purifiers have teamed up with: <a href=\"/lady-deathstrike/4005-8470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8470\">Lady Deathstrike</a>. After the New X-Men arrive Rictor runs into Anole. They both explain what is going on. The New X-Men do battle with the Purifiers before anyone knows what has happened Deathstrike stabs Hellion through the back and chest.</p><h2>Chapter 5</h2><p>In the future, Layla Miller and Madrox are scoping out a <a href=\"/mutant-containment-center-sheepshead-bay-brooklyn/4020-56868/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56868\">mutant internment camp</a>. There are no mutants in public view, and they are trying to figure out what happened to all of them. Meanwhile in the present, the X-Men have ambushed Sinister and the marauders. Emma Frost is located at the mansion, but is with them telepathically, coordinating their actions and keeping Sinister out of their minds. As battle insues the X-Men ask sinister and Gambit where they have the baby. Sinister contends that they are trying to mislead him and Gambit is confused that they don't know where the child is.</p><p>In Washington the New X-Men continue to fight the Reavers and Lady Deathstrike. It is unknown whether Hellion is still alive. As the fight continues to get worse for the young mutants, Pixie utters a spell which teleports all of them away, scattering them between Washington and the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>. The telepathic noise generated by Pixie causes Emma Frost to break her focus from the battle. Seizing this opportunity, sinister locks her out of the battle, eliminating any edge that the few X-Men had against the Marauders. The battle becomes more intense, and both Wolverine and Nightcrawler are severely injured. Nightcrawler is barely able to teleport them away from the battle, and only manages to isolate them in the vast ice.</p><p>Back at the mansion the <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels</a> of <a href=\"/sentinel-squad-one/4060-41743/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41743\">Sentinel Squad ONE</a> begin to attack the X-Men who remained behind. Their human operators have been taken over by some unknown force, causing them to lose control over the giant robots.</p><p>Lastly, <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a> makes his way on foot through the icy wilderness. Until now he was presumed dead, and he now carried with him what could be the last hope of mutantkind--the only mutant born since M-Day.</p><h2>Chapter 6</h2><p><a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, and <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a> make their way over Antarctica, rushing back to the Mansion. Wolverine's healing factor has kicked in, slowly and painfully healing his wounds. Although Storm managed to make it out relatively unscathed, both Nightcrawler and Colossus are severely injured, with Nightcrawler unconscious and bleeding out. They realize now that Cable has the mutant child, and were able to inform the others of the development before losing radio contact with the others.</p><p>Back at the mansion the remaining X-Men and New X-Men are currently battling the out of control sentinels. All of the telepaths in the mansion have been rendered unconscious. All who are capable including <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a>, <a href=\"/gentle/4005-41124/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41124\">Gentle</a>, <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Warpath</a>, <a href=\"/dust/4005-4555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\">Dust</a>, and <a href=\"/hepzibah/4005-13868/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13868\">Hepzibah</a> continue to fight the sentinels. Iceman arrives back at the mansion in one of the X-Men's jets with the wounded New X-Men, allowing X-23 to join the fight. Dust breaks into one of the sentinels, discovering that what is inside is no longer human. The Sentinel robots as well as their human drivers have been co-opted by some of <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/4005-11317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11317\">Cassandra Nova</a>'s remaining nano-sentinel bots, which have been re-programmed to exterminate all mutants. X-23 manages to take out one of the robots, and both of the sentinels are decommissioned, however one of the former pilots manages to escape.</p><p>In the wake of the attack many are injured, and the mansion's lead healer <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir</a> was taken out by falling debris during the battle. All signs point to Cable causing the destruction of the mansion, and no-one can even guess what his motivation for kidnapping the child is. Cyclops realizes that at this point drastic measures must be taken in order to prevent their destruction. He confides in Wolverine that they need a team that will be able to get things done in ways that the X-Men do not operate. He instructs Wolverine to assemble a team which he is to lead consisting of</p><p><a href=\"/hepzibah/4005-13868/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13868\">Hepzibah</a>, <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Warpath</a>, <a href=\"/caliban/4005-9637/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9637\">Caliban</a>, <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a>, and <a href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\">Wolfsbane</a>. Not only are all of them willing to do what needs to be done to locate and bring in Cable, but all are expert trackers (particularly Caliban whose mutant power allows him to locate other mutants). They will become the newest generation of <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a></p><h2>Chapter 7</h2><p>Cyclops and Professor Xavier talk as they walk through the rubble of the Institute, the Professor trying to make sense of why Cyclops would send killers after his own son. Cyclops replies by telling him that he taught him how to lead now let him do his job.</p><p>Cable is on the run in Canada, from Lady Deathstrike and the Purifiers, who want to kill the baby. They catch up with Cable, and she tells them that they are both going to die today.</p><p><a href=\"/siryn/4005-3181/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3181\">Siryn</a> receives a call from <a href=\"/peepers/4005-19354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19354\">Peepers</a>, who believes heâs being followed. Siryn says that sheâll be with him really quickly, but all of a sudden, a deer is thrown onto the front screen of Peepersâs car. As the car crashes, Predator X emerges, and all we see is Peepers screaming.</p><p>In the future, Jamie and Layla manage to lure guards out of the Mutant Camp, by making Layla lie on the floor. When they first get a reading from her, it says she isnât a mutant, but suddenly it flashes, saying she is one. She opens her eyes, telling them it flickers on and off like that, and multiple Jamieâs appear and beat the guards up. Jamie tries to get information from the guards, but they refuse to talk.</p><p>Back in Alaska, X-Force sneak into the hospital where the baby was, but unlike the rest, Warpath just knocks the guard out and walks in. He and Wolverine have a little fight about how he should do what heâs told. Theyâre put into pairs, and after Wolverine asks Wolfsbane to keep an eye on Warpath, the two have a heart-to-heart.</p><p>Cable and Lady Deathstrike continue to battle.</p><p>The guards begin to tell Jamie and Layla what they want to know about the future, including that a mutant caused all this.</p><p>Siryn discovers Peepers corpse, wondering what could have done this.</p><p>Caliban manages to sense Cable, but blows their cover while at it, so X-Force leave Alaska, while another scene shows the Professor looking over a picture of the old X-Force.</p><p>Cable and Lady Deathstrike continue to fight.</p><p>Multiple guards discover and arrest Layla, but when they suspect Layla of being human, she tells them that sheâs a mutant too, and she is arrested also.</p><h2>Chapter 8</h2><p>As Deathstrike is about to kill Cable and the baby, X-Force arrives to battle her and the Purifiers.</p><p>In the future, Jamie and Layla are taken into the Mutant Camp.</p><p>X-Force kill several Reavers, and Wolverine tracks Cable. Deathstrike attempts to fight Wolverine, but he makes X-23 battle her instead, and he continues to track Cable.</p><p>As Predator X continues to hunt, Surge and Emma watch over the Med Lab, as Beast and Prodigy rest after operating on Hellion. Emma explains to Surge that she chose her to lead the New X-Men because she knew sheâd protect them from anything, even her. She leaves Surge, and the X-Men and X-Factor prepare to leave.</p><p>Back in Canda, X-23 and Deathstrike continue to fight. X-23 waits, and stabs Deathstrike in the shoulder, damaging her cybernetics, rendering her unable to use her arm. Wolfsbane kills a Purifier, after he says that <a href=\"/reverend-craig/4005-14853/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14853\">Reverend Craig</a> told the Purifiers about her. As the other members of X-Force continue to follow Cable, a Purifier goes to shoot Warpath, but Caliban jumps in the way, getting killed in the process. Warpath throws one of his knives at the gunman, piercing him through the head. As Warpath grieves over Caliban, Wolverine shouts at him to stay on target, but he doesnât listen. X-23 takes down Deathstrike, and leaves her, possibly for dead. As Wolverine catches up with Cable, he jumps out of the way, realizing he was heading for the Blackbird, which he flies out over Wolverine.</p><h2>Chapter 9</h2><p>Jamie and Layla, are shaved and cleaned as theyâre taken into the Camp.</p><p>As the X-Men approach X-Forceâs location, Emma tells the X-Men and X-Factor that Cableâs gone, asking do they want the bad news now. Warpath continues to grieve over Caliban, while Wolverine briefs Cyclops in on the situation. Strong Guy and Warpath load Calibanâs body onto the Blackbird, Cyclops declaring that he died an X-Man.</p><p>Back at the Institute, several students are in Cerebra, as Prodigy fixes her.</p><p>In Texas, Cable hijacks a lorry.</p><p>Back in the future, Jamie is branded with the âMâ that <a href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a> was branded with. He asks where Layla is and the marker tells him that sheâs being processed in the female section.</p><p>Back on the Blackbird, the X-Men try to figure out where Cableâs heading. As they talk telepathically, Prodigy finishes fixing Cerebra, and the <a href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\">Stepford Cuckoos</a> tell Cyclops that Cableâs in Texas, and they figure heâs heading for Forge in Eagle Plaza.</p><p>Cable drives the lorry through a wall of Eagle Plaza. As he looks around for Forge, he finds him, unconscious on the floor, and he is then shot in the back.</p><p>Back in the future, Jamie wakes up surrounded by mutants, who tell him heâll be okay.</p><p>Back in Eagle Plaza, <a href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a> is revealed to be the traitor.</p><h2>Chapter 10</h2><p>As Cable and Forge lie unconscious on the floor of Eagle Plaza, Bishop holds the baby at gunpoint. Just before he can shoot, Gambit and the Marauders attack. Malice goes to retrieve the baby, while <a href=\"/vertigo/4005-3561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3561\">Vertigo</a>, Gambit and <a href=\"/sunfire/4005-3175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3175\">Sunfire</a> take on Bishop, who the manage to defeat. As Malice cradles the baby, Gambit wonders what would have made Bishop turn.</p><p>In the future, Jamie gets beaten up by guards while heâs looking for Layla. When he finds her, she takes him to meet Bishop, as a child, because he grew up in the Mutant Camp.</p><p>The X-Men arrive at Eagle Plaza, and Bishop tells them that he received the call from the Cuckoos and rushed over. Emma scans Prime Jamie for any messages from the future, but admits that heâs basically brain dead. Cyclops tells Bishop to take X-Force onto his ship, he needs them in the air if they get Cableâs location. Warpath and Hepzibah quickly squabble about her not coming, but Wolverine tells him that they need everyone they can get. The Stepford Cuckoos are unable to find the baby, but Emma guides them through what to do, and Cyclops tells them to find Cable to, saying that they need to shut him down for good.</p><p>On the outskirts of Dallas, Cable returns to the Blackbird he stole. Still injured, he manages to contact Xavier, to which Cable tells him ââ¦and right now, youâre the only one left who can help me save the future.â</p><h2>Chapter 11</h2><p>In the future, Layla and Jamie find young Bishop, but he runs away, and Layla is hit in the head by a guard. They continue to follow young Bishop, and ask him what happens. He tells them about the mutant messiah, and how there were no problems with mutants, until the messiah killed one million. He then admits that he wished the messiah had never been born. After young Bishop walks off, the guard who hit Layla earlier comes running up to her asking her where it is. She turns to Jamie, and throws a grenade at him, while saying âIâm sorry Jamieâ¦ But this is the only way. Trust me. Iâm Laylaâ¦Madrox. I know stââ, and Jamie explodes</p><p>Back in the present, Cyclops thinks about the situation, and how something doesnât quite add up. Emma tells him that the girls have found the Marauders through Gambit, and their heading to Muir Island. Cyclops tells Bishop (whoâs in the air with X-Force) to head there. Siryn prays over Jamieâs comatosed body, and suddenly he wakes up, with the âMâ on his face. He screams , and when they finally manage to calm him, he states âWhereâs Bishop?â.</p><p>Professor Xavier fixes Cableâs mechanical arm in the Blackbird Cable stole.</p><p>As the X-Men and X-Factor try to contact Bishop, they all begin putting the pieces of the jigsaw together. Jamie, supported by Siryn, comes in and shouts at Cyclops saying they need to get Layla back, but Emma simply puts him to sleep. Cyclops announces to everyone to saddle up, because their going after the baby too.</p><p>Back in the stolen Blackbird, Xavier tells Cable no more secrets, and Xavier shows Cable a telepathic illusion of the Sentinels attacking the mansion. Cable admits that he didnât do that, and tells Xavier that the only thing that matters is saving the baby, and that they need to find her. Xavier drops the illusion, showing that he has already done that, and that theyâre en route to Muir Island.</p><p>As the Marauders return to Muir Island, and <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mr. Sinister</a> himself, telling the Marauders to go about theyâre business, except Gambit who has the baby. Gambit hands the baby to Sinister, who drops the charade and is revealed to be Mystique, with Mr. Sinister lying dead on the floor.</p><p>Back at the Institute, Dust, Rockslide and Mercury go to visit the graves of their dead friends. But there, they find Predator X feasting on their corpses.</p><p>On Muir Island, X-Force and Bishop are unable to find anything. Wolverine makes this quick speech about how the Marauders have people who can get inside your head like <a href=\"/lady-mastermind/4005-12055/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12055\">Lady Mastermind</a>, and he stabs into thin air. The illusion drops, showing Wolverine to have stabbed Lady Mastermind right through the stomach. This also shows the other Marauders, ready to attack.</p><h2>Chapter 12</h2><p>Sinister comes to tell Mystique that Rogue is going to die, but she grabs him and makes his face come into contact with hers, killing him, revealing she knew, she always did.</p><p>Back in the present, Gambit is in shock about the dead Sinister, and how heâs free from him.</p><p>As the battle begins, Wolverine shouts to Warpath and Wolfsbane that if they hold back, theyâll die. Wolverine is then shot in the eye by <a href=\"/scalphunter/4005-9734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9734\">Scalphunter</a>. As Bishop takes out Sunfire, and just after Wolfsbane bites <a href=\"/arclight/4005-13369/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13369\">Arclight</a> neck, sheâs attacked and taken out of the battlefield by <a href=\"/riptide/4005-9732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9732\">Riptide</a>. Back to Wolverine, Scrambler touches Wolverineâs face, leaving him unable to heal. As he torments Wolverine, X-23 cuts both his hands off and basically guts him, then telling Wolverine that he heals to slow. Just as Scalphunter is about to shoot Hepzibah, Warpath throws one of his knives at him, hitting him in the ahoulder and pinning him to the wall. As Mystique comes to pull it out, telling Scalphunter to hold the X-Men off, the other X-Men arrive to join the fight. Cyclops shouts that he wants to see Bishop.</p><p>Gambit asks Mystique how this works, asking if she hooks the baby up to a machine or something. She replies âNot exactlyâ and pushes the babyâs forehead against Rogueâs lips.</p><p>Back at the Institute, Predator X bites through Rockslide and head for the Institute. The animal smashes through the window where <a href=\"/trance/4005-40885/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40885\">Trance</a>, <a href=\"/wolf-cub/4005-40640/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40640\">Wolf Cub</a> and <a href=\"/indra/4005-40671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40671\">Indra</a> are watching. Just before Predator X can eat Indra, Surge appears and zaps it in the face.</p><p>Just as Riptide is going to kill Wolfsbane, Xavier knocks him out mentally, and he checks on Wolfsbane. He and Cable continue onwards.</p><p>As light explodes from the baby, Gambit snatches the baby from Mystique, telling her how Rogue never would have wanted a baby to die for her. Gambit turns to the baby, seeing that itâs completely fine. Rogue doesnât wake up, and Mystique breaks down. As Gambit continues to lecture to Mystique, Xavier appears behind him.</p><p>As the battle rages on, Cable knocks <a href=\"/tempo/4005-13312/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13312\">Tempo</a> out, and Xavier tells him that he has the baby, and to clear a path.</p><p>The other New X-Men, including a reformed Rockslide, to take on Predator X. Predator X heads for the Med Lab, where several injured mutants are recovering. <a href=\"/gentle/4005-41124/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41124\">Gentle</a> and Armor, attacking Predator X, smash through a wall of the Med Lab, where Pixie, <a href=\"/loa/4005-40672/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40672\">Loa</a> and Beast are trying to help the injured escape. Luckily, Nightcrawler is awake, and he teleports the injured out. As the New X-Men arrive, Surge shouts that X-23âs claws can hurt Predator X. Hearing this, Pixie says that she can take them to X-23, and she teleports them all to Muir Island. Predator X devours Vertigo, and the New X-Men join the battle. Xavier gives Cable the baby, and as they go to leave, Bishop and Predator X arrive, both ready to kill.</p><h2>Chapter 13</h2><p>Bishop shoots at Cable, and Predator X lunges for him. Cable gets out of the way, and Predator X eats Bishopâs arm.</p><p>The New X-Men join the battle, Emma battles Exodus telepathically, X-Force take on Predator X. Cyclops asks Cable to give him the baby, and Cable pulls a gun on him. Xavier appears, and tells Cable to give Cyclops the baby.</p><p>Back to Mystique, as she cries over Rogue, Rogue wakes up. Gambit and Mystique are ecstatic, but after Mystique tells Rogue about the baby, and even though it survived, Rogue is furious. Rogue slaps Mystique, and tells her that this has to be the last time.</p><p>Back to the battle, Hepzibah throws several explosives at Predator X, and it spits some sort of acid at her in return, wounding her. Malice continuously punches Pixie, and as she taunts her, Pixie turns around and stabs her with her Soul Dagger. While Emma and Exodus continue to battle mentally, itâs revealed to be a distraction, and Dust was able to take him down by entering his body through his mouth and nose. In another part of the battle, Xavier manages to convince Cable to give Cyclops the baby.</p><p>Back underneath the battle, Rogue grabs Mystiqueâs face.</p><p>Heqzibah is hurt even more when she is hit by Predator Xâs tail. Suddenly, Wolverine gets an idea, and jumps into Predator Xâs mouth. X-23 goes crazy, and as the other X-Men come to battle Predator X too, itâs dissected from the inside-out, by Wolverine.</p><p>Emma asks Cyclops to report, and he reports that he has the baby. At that instant the baby picks up the locket from around Cyclopsâs neck, opening it to reveal a picture of him and Jean. After a few flashbacks, Cyclops tells Xavier that there are two possible futures, and this child is the key to them both.</p><p>As Rogue and Gambit overlook Mystiqueâs body, Gambit believing her to be dead, Rogue tells him that the baby cured her of Strain-88 and every other mind sheâd ever adsorbed, but now, itâs only her and Mystique. Rogue walks off, telling Gambit not to follow her.</p><p>Back above, Cyclops gives the baby back to Cable. As he does, Bishop stands up and shoots at Cable, only to hit Xavier in the head. Cyclops blasts him, and as Beast gets to Xavier, heâs dead. All the X-Men and X-Factor gather round Xavierâs corpse and Cyclops declares that there are no more X-Men.</p><p>In the future, Cable tells the baby âNow comes the hard part.â</p><h2>Aftermath and Consequences</h2><p>The following are characters that are apparently killed during the event: Mister Sinister, Scrambler, Vertigo, Lady Mastermind, Peepers, Caliban, Predator X, and Lady Deathstrike.</p><p>Professor Xavier is believed to have been killed by Bishop. However, the very last panel shows all the X-Men looking down where Xavierâs body had been, but his body has disappeared while no one seems to notice. In X-men Legacy it is revealed that his body was taken and revived by the Acolytes.</p><p>Cyclops takes command as the leader of the X-Men. The Xavier Institute was destroyed during the events of Messiah Complex. He says the X-Men are no more, but it is most likely he meant this as some kind of symbolism due to the fact that they will no longer be lead by Xavier. Cyclops continues to run operations for all teams.</p><p>Cyclops reforms the X-Force black-ops team to deal with the largest threats to mutantkind by any means necessary. The team is lead by Wolverine and consists of him, Warpath, X-23, and Wolfsbane. Their first post-messiah mission is to take out the Purifiers.</p><p>Rogue is cured of the effects of Strain 88 and freed of the eight million psyches she had absorbed from the Hecatomb. Her mind is completely to herself for the first time since her powers manifested. Not knowing the extent of what had happened, Rogue attempts to kill her mother Mystique by absorbing her, but Mystiqueâs mind become trapped in Rogueâs.</p><p>Cable escapes into the future with the mutant baby to protect her. Bishops follows him into the future, intent on killing the baby to prevent a future where the baby grows up and kills over a million humans.</p><p>The aftermath of Messiah Complex is covered under the <a href=\"/divided-we-stand/4045-52603/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-52603\">Divided We Stand</a> title.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>Ras Al Ghul steals Batman's secret files and uses them to incapacitate the JLA. This is in service of a larger plot for mass destruction of the human race, as he renders all forms of communication useless. The JLA survives the assault and rallies to thwart his plans, but are shaken by the breach of trust by Batman.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p><a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Bruce Wayne</a> goes to visit his parents grave and finds it missing. He then goes out to find their bodies. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/4005-40816/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\">Ra's Al Ghul</a> is at his lair, he is angry that one of his men had fed an endangered creature with chocolate and killed it. He reveals he has a giant zoo of animals that were thought to be extinct. He begins to talk about a plan that will destroy the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">JLA</a>. <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\">J'onn J'onzz</a> is flying over a forest when <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/4005-4917/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4917\">Talia Al Ghul</a> and a group of men shoots at him. Struck by the missile, J'onn is perplexed that it had no explosive payload, but is quickly alarmed when he sees microscopic vision that there is a cloud of tiny nanobots swarming. Suddenly, he finds himself engulfed in flame, his greatest vulnerability.</p><p>A while later, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\">Flash</a> respond to a ferocious forest fire. They race each other to the site and a figure on fire seemingly attacks them. After using a whirlwind to deprive the fire of oxygen, they realize that it was J'onn. Meanwhile, at the UN building the Atlanteans and humans argue for peace when <a href=\"/aquaman/4005-2357/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\">Aquaman</a> and <a href=\"/plastic-man/4005-6270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6270\">Plastic Man</a> disrupt the meeting because they had received a tip about a terrorist attack. They find the terrorists and they fire a gas grenade at Aquaman while the other fires a flash freeze beam at Plastic man and he is completely frozen. One of the terrorists cracks Plastic Man's frozen figure with a hammer and smashed him to pieces. Aquaman is rendered terrified of water and denies water he needs to survive.</p><p>J'onn is taken to the <a href=\"/justice-league-watchtower/4020-41469/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41469\">Watchtower</a> where he is placed in a tube filled with water to keep him from catching fire in contact with air. Plastic Man meanwhile is being defrosted and <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> calls Batman, who is hijacking a helicopter. Superman warns that the Justice League is being attacked but Batman says he's busy. Wonder Woman and Flash decide to go over to <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\">Kyle Rayner</a>'s (Green Lantern) apartment because he hasn't responded yet. Superman goes over to the <a href=\"/daily-planet/4020-55695/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55695\">Daily Planet</a>. Ra's, meanwhile, activates his Tower of Babel and all written words become unreadable. No one is able to read anything. Superman was first to notice this and he tries to control whatever is happening. Wonder Woman and Flash are unaware of this as they go Kyle's apartment in civilian clothes. They arrive only to find that Kyle was now blind.</p><p>Aquaman is trying to figure out how they found J'onn and him and attacked them. Although he is barely conscious, he has that 'Eureka' moment and figures out that the attackers were using the Leagues own tracking devices. He tries to warn them but before they could the bad guys attack them. Aquaman contacts his base in <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a> and asks them to bring something for him. Wonder Woman and Flash change into their costumes and fight the mysterious attackers. Wonder Woman is hit by a ray gun and she thinks that she sees someone as powerful as her attack her. Flash is hit by a velocity bullet and he is vibrating non stop.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271691-57182-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271691\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.8975\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271691-57182-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271691\"><img alt=\"JLA incapacitated\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271691-57182-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271691-57182-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>JLA incapacitated</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, Batman invades Ra's lair he arrives and finds that his parent's bodies are hung over a <a href=\"/lazarus-pit/4055-40817/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40817\">Lazarus Pit</a>. Ra's offers Batman a chance to resurrect his parents. Batman refuses and Ra's says he knew that it was the decision he would make. He then takes out a <a href=\"/red-kryptonite/4055-56333/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56333\">red kryptonite</a> sample and Batman looks on horrified. Talia meanwhile arrives at Kyle's apartment, Kyle goes berserk and Talia helps in stopping him. Talia alludes to a mysterious designer of the traps, J'onn bursts into the room and is wearing an Atlantean suit filled with water. He tries to get things under control but Talia knew his powers were limited because of the suit, she hurls <a href=\"/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-51489\">Wonder Woman's Tiara</a> and cuts off a part of the suit. J'onn begins to catch fire again but Superman arrives after putting a force field over Metropolis. Talia still looks confident and she takes out a piece of red kryptonite, Superman begins to feel weak but suddenly his skin becomes transparent and absorbing sunlight suddenly becomes painful to him.</p><p>Batman, meanwhile is still at the Himalayas in Ra's base trying to get away. He manages to get out of the base as Ra's men chase him across the mountain. Batman shouts through the communicator that he was the one who designed the League's traps, the signals trackers and they were all his.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271690-121775-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271690\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.885\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271690-121775-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271690\"><img alt=\"\"I did this to you!\"\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271690-121775-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271690-121775-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>\"I did this to you!\"</figcaption></figure><p>He says that Ra's has stolen his equipment to incapacitate them. Ra's meanwhile is calmly sitting in a room, as the scientists prepares to do something. Batman still running says there are ways to counter the traps but before he could tell them Ra's presses a button and Aquaman couldn't understand what he was saying.</p><p>Batman is cornered at a mountain peak, he jumps off the mountain and the henchmen assumes he is dead. Aquaman tries to teleport Superman and the others but he falls unconscious and an awakened Plastic Man teleports them back to the Watchtower. Talia returns to her father's base and she begins to question her father's motives. Ra's Al Ghul tries to reassure her, then one of the men arrive and says that Batman has perished in the mountain side. Talia slaps the man in anger and walks away. The man walks away and into the shadows and he is revealed to be Batman in disguise. Aquaman wakes up in a desert and finds himself very comfortable there, but he is actually in a water tank and the desert is only an illusion J'onn is projecting into his mind. J'onn uses his x-ray vision to guide Plastic Man's finger as he tries to remove the nanobot in Wonder Woman's brain,while Superman is trying to burn off his excess power. He had become so powerful that he can hear a grasshopper's heart beating in Brazil. J'onn figures out that Kyle's blindness is actually a post hypnotic suggestion and when he takes off his <a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">Power Ring</a> he begins to see again. They were also able to get vibration bullet off Flash. Even on the moon Superman can hear the world panicking as fires and riots burn down cities. No one on earth can read or understand what anyone is saying.</p><p>Batman calls the League for help on a secure line shielded from Ra's Tower of Babel. He asks them to follow his signal to a certain place. Superman thinks its a trap and he goes there alone, he meets with Batman who says that he will explain things later, but they are going to need J'onn's telepathic powers to communicate through their minds.</p><p>The JLA along with Batman arrive at a snowy summit. J'onn and Aquaman are at the Watchtower. Batman says through the telepathic link J'onn provided for the Leaguers that he has found Ra's tower of Babel. Two fighter jets arrive and Wonder Woman and Green Lantern goes after them. Kyle wants this to finish this up fast since they'll find out why Batman exploited them. The JLA members manage to hold off the defenses as Superman and Flash infiltrate the Tower. A red alarm sounds and they couldn't understand their own thoughts. Superman relays his last thought to Flash telling him to get out. Superman burns off the excess energy in him by blowing up the tower with his heat vision. Superman begins to walk out of the rubble and he begins to fall unconscious. Batman says that it's only residual side effects of the red kryptonite and that Superman will recover.</p><p>Talia contacts them through a separate tower where she is transmitting her words to the JLA's minds. She says that the disruption of language was merely a distraction. With the world's defenses now weakened Ra's Al Ghul is going to set two attacks one in Turkey and the other somewhere else. They are going to launch a canister over Turkey where it will release a nuclear material where it's going to kill half the city's population. Talia says she's telling them this because she is tired of her father's constant plans of ruling the world and only to fail. Before she could go any further someone shoots her in the leg. The attacker says that she said too much and the JLA cannot stop. He then cuts off the transmission.</p><p>J'onn takes off his protective water suit, since Martian's can shed their skin, the nano bots are off of him. He then goes into the same tank as Aquaman in attempt to help him lose his fear of water. He makes him aware he is in a water tank and tells him not to be afraid and to change his fear into something else, with no choice, he tells him to turn his fear into anger towards Batman. At the snowy region, Batman says that they should split up and he and Superman will go towards Ra's headquarters while the rest goes after the canisters. Plastic Man is reluctant to trust Batman but he says that they will talk about that later. Flash super speeds towards the location of the first canister, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Plastic Man are behind. As they fly off towards Ra's headquarters, Superman asks Batman why he did it.</p><p>Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Plastic man arrive to find that one of the terrorists have opened the canister near a city and Flash was standing near the man. He was vibrating in his place because if he moved he might spread the nuclear material. Green Lantern puts a protective force field over them and gas mask over to nearby people. Plastic man and Wonder Woman goes after the second one. Ubu brings in the attacker who shot Talia. Talia was missing but the man claims he shot her in the leg. He believed that Ra's would be proud of him. Ubu asks his master's permission to drop the man to be eaten by a rare species of lions. Ra's grants him permission to do so.</p><p>Batman and Superman arrive at the mountain side, Batman recalls to Superman the time when an alien named <a href=\"/agamemno/4005-55832/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55832\">Agamemno</a> gave some criminals access to JLA's bodies. Batman says that the traps were meant to be fail-safe for such an attack. They arrive just when the man was dropped to be eaten by the lions. Superman saves the man and Batman tries to go after Ra's, only one problem Batman has to go through two lions and a tiger. The remaining canister is in the hands of two terrorists, one of them tries create a distraction by shooting to the crowd. The other goes to the roof to open the canister and release the nuclear material into the air. The first terrorist shoot to the crowd and Wonder Woman stops the bullets from hitting the targets. Plastic Man captures him and Wonder Woman flies to the rooftop. The man tries to get away but Wonder Woman lassos him before he falls off the building. Unfortunately, he bumps into two kids and they fall off the building.</p><p>Superman uses the metal around him to trap the tiger and lions that were about to attack him and Batman. They go after Ra's and Batman tells Superman that Ra's still has a weaker form of the red kryptonite and that he should after the Wayne's coffin. Superman goes after the coffins but finds the red kryptonite on the coffins. Batman goes through Ra's men and he presses a button and the coffins begin to fall. Aquaman catches the weakened Superman with the grapnel hook of his arm, J'onn flies over and catches the Wayne's coffins before they fall to the Lazarus pit. Batman goes after Ra's but he has already escaped and promised that Talia will pay for her betrayal. Batman however was able to capture Dr. Kant the biologist who had designed the Tower of Babel. Plastic Man caught the kids before they had hit the ground, Wonder Woman negotiates with the terrorist. With the help of the Lasso of Truth she convinces the terrorist to give up.</p><h3>Epilogue</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271692\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.71\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271692\"><img alt=\"Wonder Woman's vote\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg 400w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wonder Woman's vote\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg 400w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wonder Woman's vote</figcaption></figure><p>The League returns to the Watchtower. Batman is waiting in another room while the other members vote for whether Batman should be excluded or whether he should stay. Everyone votes and 3 for membership and 3 for expulsion which leaves Superman to take the last vote. Each member had their own reasons for excluding or forgiving Batman.</p><p><b>Voted For Expulsion</b></p><ul><li>Wonder Woman: She understands Batman's reason's for exploiting her weaknesses but she believes that he would be a weakness in the future.</li><li>Aquaman: He thinks that they had earned the world's trust but his decision was affected due to his anger towards Batman.</li><li>Plastic Man: He was still traumatized by the fact that he was frozen and smashed to pieces. Batman himself stated that he was afraid of how Plastic Man's mind might react when he was designing the countermeasures.</li><li>Superman: At first no one knew how Superman voted but in JLA #50 it is said he voted for expulsion.</li></ul><p><b>Voted For Membership</b></p><ul><li>J'onn J'onzz: He himself had kept information and dossiers of the League and has since been forgiven by the League. J'onn saw expulsion unnecessary because he somewhat understands why he did it.</li><li>Green Lantern: Kyle may still be new to the League.

Even then she is beginning to doubt her father. Her father's organization had learned about the plans through tiny hints during Batman and Oracle's communication. Talia got into the Watchtower through the League's food and supply teleporter. She fools the Tower's security system as they think she is Wonder Woman because of her height and her bracelets.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>It is June in Gotham City, and Johnny Viti, nephew of Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone, is getting married on the hottest day of the year. The Roman rules over an intricate crime family which in turn rules over Gotham. However, the Falcone mob is in desperate need of a means to launder their ill-gotten gains, and the Roman sees the Gotham City Bank as a likely source. To that end, the Roman has used his influence on several members of the bank's board of directors, including bank president Richard Daniel, to persuade them to accept his family's business. Carmine takes advantage of the occasion of his nephew's wedding to similarly convince Bruce Wayne, but Bruce is not swayed and leaves in a huff. The Roman confides in his bodyguard Milos that he is disappointed at Wayne's refusal, but that the deal still has enough votes to get through.</p><p>Bruce listens in on the conversation from the hallway until he is discovered by Alberto Falcone, the \"good son\" who shows Bruce the door and eyes him menacingly as he goes. Bruce is eager to leave and pursue his regular night activities, until he meets up with Selina Kyle. Selina seductively convinces Bruce to stay, and their dancing attracts the attention of Carla Viti, mother of the groom and sister to the Roman. Carla is in turn being watched over by the Roman, spying from his office and ruminating on his less-than-smooth relationship with his sister. When Alberto informs Carmine about Bruce listening at the door, Carmine tells him to stay out of the family business. Meanwhile Harvey Dent, district attorney of Gotham City, has been in the basement parking garage of the Roman's home, copying down the license plate numbers of various cars. But his actions have not gone unnoticed, and the Roman's goons come and give him a beating, warning him to lay off for his own sake. Luckily Bruce and Selina soon arrive, on their way home for the evening, and help him to his feet. Harvey brushes himself off and curtly walks away. Although Selina asks Bruce if he has further plans for the evening, Bruce claims he is tired and they part company.</p><p>Harvey meets up with Captain Jim Gordon of the Gotham City Police later that night and the two discuss possible means of bringing the Roman down, including involving the Batman. Similarly, Bruce and Selina meet again in the Roman's penthouse, this time in their costumed guises of Batman and Catwoman. Their presence quickly attracts the presence of the Roman's guards, but they manage to escape under a cloud of smoke and a barrage of bullets. The Roman, furious over this invasion of his privacy and at being taunted by his chief rival Sal Maroni over the break-in, puts a million dollar bounty on both of their heads. Batman chases Catwoman through the city but she eludes him even as she dodges his questions regarding her motivations against the Roman. Batman loses her and gives up the chase to answer a Bat-signal sent out by Harvey and Jim, who discuss the mutual strains put on their marriages by long hours at work while they await Batman's arrival. When Batman appears, the three discuss the lengths they will go to bring the Roman down. The three enter a pact (Batman however agreeing rather reluctantly) to bend the rules if necessary but never break them. Batman then disappears into darkness, but he leaves behind for Harvey and Jim the Roman's ledger, an incriminating piece of evidence Batman stole from the safe in the Roman's penthouse.</p><p>Soon, Bruce is in a meeting of the board of Gotham City Bank, very vocally protesting the position of the other board members in favor of accepting the Falcones' money. When he proves unable to sway them, Bruce storms out, but that evening Batman pays a visit to Richard Daniel, the bank president, warning him to keep the Falcone money out. Daniel subsequently resigns from his position and Bruce steps in. In August Falcone meets with his family and, enraged over Daniel's betrayal, orders his nephew Johnny to come home from his honeymoon as soon as possible to take care of the problem. In September Johnny Viti kills Richard Daniel, gunning him down as he is on his way home from a movie. Jim and Harvey both receive the news at home later that night.</p><p>On the day of Halloween, Johnny Viti is shot twice in the head by an unknown assailant while taking a bath. The perpetrator leaves behind the murder weapon, a .22 caliber pistol with the nipple of a baby bottle used as a crude silencer, as well as a jack-o-lantern. That night Harvey, Batman, and Jim discuss the murder, and Harvey lets it be known that he couldn't care less about the death of a mafia hitman. The three discuss the particulars of the murder and toss about possible suspects, when Batman notices that their conversation is being eavesdropped upon. Catwoman, listening in on their discussion from the rooftop, offers to help Batman hit the Roman where it hurts the most: his money. Catwoman's information leads Batman and Harvey to a warehouse on Gotham Harbor, where they discover that the Roman has stockpiled over twenty million dollars. Harvey contemplates stealing some of it, but Batman puts a curb on such thoughts. Instead they together set fire to the warehouse and destroy the money. Harvey cheerfully returns home to help his wife Gilda give out candy to trick-or-treaters. But as he is rummaging through his mail, a bomb hidden inside a package goes off and blows the Dent house sky high, with Harvey and Gilda barely surviving. For months afterward, the killings continue.On New Year's Eve, the scheming Joker intends to release his gas on Gotham Square at midnight, killing the crowd and hopefully Holiday. To that end the Joker has hijacked a plane and killed the flight crew. Batman arrives just as the Joker is taking off and hitches onto the plane. As Batman fights with the Joker in mid-air, Harvey Dent is working late on the Holiday case. Just as he is leaving, his new assistant Vernon comes in with new information on the Roman case. He has searched old police files and discovered a connection between Carmine Falcone and Bruce Wayne On Carmine's yacht in Gotham Harbor, the Roman is talking with Maroni during the New Year's party Carmine is hosting. Sal says that the Holiday killings have been bad for business and that they should put aside their differences to put an end to it. But Carmine subtly suggests that Maroni might be behind Holiday, using as evidence the fact that the hits have all been on members of the Falcone family. Then while Carmine is talking with Carla, she points out his tendency to surround himself with enemies. Carmine's response implies that she too could be counted among that number. Carla stomps off to go out on deck, just in time to see Alberto fall overboard, shot by Holiday.</p><p>Harvey arrives home, apologizing to Gilda for his lateness. She notes his hair is wet despite the fact that he was wearing a hat. Harvey enters the living room to find the Gordons there to celebrate New Year's with them, but Harvey heads off for the kitchen. Jim follows, leaving Gilda and Barbara to discuss the possibility of the Dents having children. Gilda however feels like it's a lost cause, since Harvey is always working. Barbara tells Gilda that business is a taboo subject that evening, but in the kitchen Harvey and Jim are discussing Harvey's recent discovery about Bruce Wayne.</p><p>And high above the city, just as the clock strikes midnight, Batman pummels the Joker and aims the plane toward the harbor. At the last possible moment he grabs the Joker and leaps to the nearby clock atop a skyscraper. The plane harmlessly splashes down into the water and Gotham is saved. The murders continue, and soon it is August 2, Falcone's birthday, and the date on which Maroni is going to trial to testify against Carmine Falcone, but before Harvey can leave home and head for court, Gilda stops him. She is disturbed by something she has found in the basement--a .22, just like one of Holidayâs guns. Harvey claims that itâs simply evidence he brought home from work, curtly ignoring Gildaâs surprise as he goes. Batman has other things on his mind than the trial, namely finding the Riddler, who Holiday let live on April Foolâs Day. Batman tracks him down at a small tavern and challenges his connection to Holiday. Riddler explains that the Roman hired him to find out who Holiday was but kicked him out when the solutions he gave were less than satisfactory. This information leads Batman to posit that maybe Riddler was left alive to spread the word that the Roman was looking for Holiday.</p><p>Carmine is similarly being disputed by Carla, who disapproves of the family hiring freaks like Poison Ivy and the Riddler, as they have done of late. Sofia interrupts the argument to lead Carmine away... to a surprise party in his honor. August 2 is the Romanâs birthday, after all. In Salâs cell before the trial, Jim Gordon pats Maroni down to make sure heâs not carrying any weapons into the courtroom. But Vernon meets Sal at the door of the court to give him stomach medicine for his ulcer. Harvey is optimistic as Sal takes the stand that his testimony will bring organized crime in Gotham to a halt. Once under oath Maroni admits to killing two members of the Gazzo family, a mob operating in Metropolis. When Harvey inquires if the Roman ordered the hit, Sal fakes a coughing fit and reaches for his stomach medicine. It is not medicine but actually acid. Sal hurls it in Harveyâs face and he falls to the floor screaming. Harvey is rushed to the hospital but once there he stabs a doctor and escapes. And Carla Viti, investigating the coronerâs files on the Holiday victims, becomes one herself. As of Labor Day, Harvey Dent has been missing for a month since last issueâs incident in the courtroom. He has been hiding out in Gothamâs sewers where he crosses paths with Solomon Grundy. At first Grundy attacks him, but when Harvey begins reciting the nursery rhyme from which Grundy received his name, he stops and calms down.</p><p>Batman and Jim Gordon are baffled by the turn of events that have befallen Harvey. Jim has come to the conclusion, based on his discovery that Harvey possessed a .22, that Harvey is Holiday. Batman refuses to acknowledge it, but Jim needs proof otherwise before he believes Harvey is innocent. Jim needs to hear it from Harvey himself. Batman first searches at Falconeâs penthouse, asking Carmine if he knows where Harvey is. The Roman is enraged at Batman, accusing him of knowing that Dent was Holiday but standing aside while he killed, because criminals were the only victims. Batman departs and seeks out Catwoman, demanding to know why she is so interested in Falcone. As usual she runs away rather than reply. Batman confronts Gilda next about her husbandâs whereabouts, inquiring about the .22 they found. Batman tells her that he found gun metal shavings on Harveyâs workbench, as if he had filed away the serial numbers there, but Gilda can provide no explanation. Batman finally ends up at Arkham Asylum, talking to Julian Day, the Calendar Man. Batman tells Day that they know Harvey is Holiday but not how to find him. Julian suggests that, it being a holiday, there is only one option as to the location of Holiday.</p><p>That night Jim Gordon, at Batmanâs request, moves Sal Maroni to a new cell. Batman believes that Maroni is most likely destined to be Holidayâs next victim. Sure enough, Batmanâs prediction comes true when Holiday surfaces to shoot Sal twice in the head during the prisoner transfer. Salâs helmeted guard lunges toward Holiday, who shoots him multiple times in the chest and takes him down. Holiday trains his gun on Jim Gordon, who can only helplessly stare up into the face of the man about to kill him... Alberto Falcone. Salâs helmeted bodyguard leaps up. It is Batman, who was protected from the .22 bullets by a kevlar vest. Batman pummels Alberto and almost kills him, but Jim stops him. Alberto is placed under arrest and jailed. A few days later Carmine comes to visit his son Alberto in jail and offers his assistance. He tells Alberto that he can get him out if he will plead guilty to Maroniâs murder alone and drop any notion of being âHoliday.â Alberto spurns Carmine, saying he felt slighted when Carmine sent him to Oxford and kept him out of the family business. He says that Gotham now belongs to the freaks, and he is one of them. On Halloween Jim and Barbara Gordon go to visit Gilda to check up on how she is managing alone. She is still left wondering where Harvey is and if he is even still alive. Meanwhile at Arkham there has been a breakout. All of the maniacs have been set free by a solitary figure who, after flipping a coin, decides to leave Calendar Man in his cell. Carmine is furious over Albertoâs unwillingness to accept his help, which has subsequently led to his impending execution for the Holiday murders. As he is ranting in the kitchen to Sofia, the lights cut out suddenly. The two explore the house with their guns drawn, finding guards dead all around. They burst into the Romanâs office to find all of the Arkham escapees there, along with Solomon Grundy, Catwoman, and their mysterious leader, who reveals himself to be Harvey.</p><p>Harvey is about to kill Carmine when Batman drops in, taking down the villains one by one under the cover of a smokescreen. The distraction of Batman fighting the villains has allowed Harvey the opportunity to grab Carmine, however, and he faces down Batman with a gun to Carmineâs head. When Batman appeals to Harvey to let Carmine go, Harvey tells him that his name is now Two-Face. Two-Face then flips his coin which lands scarred side up. Evil wins; Two-Face shoots Carmine twice in the head from point blank range. Sofia screams and rushes forward to attack Two-Face, but Catwoman stops her. The two wrestle and fall through a glass window. Outside Catwoman is able to grab onto a ledge, but Sofia plunges to the ground many stories below. Two-Face knocks Batman out and goes to take revenge upon Vernon for his part in Harveyâs disfigurement, giving Maroni the acid. Batman finds Vernonâs dead body later and, following the Bat-signal to the police department, then discovers Harvey on the roof ready to turn himself in. Harvey says that justice has been done now that he has killed the Roman. As Gordon slaps the cuffs on Harvey, Two-Face drops one final bombshell as they take him away; he tells them that there were TWO Holiday killers. Later Jim and Batman discuss what Harvey might have meant with his final statement, since Alberto has confessed to all the Holiday murders. Batman postulates that, since Harvey killed the Roman on Halloween, he was the second killer. Jim goes home to his wife Barbara and says that he has to keep fighting for the good of Gotham, despite what it has cost. Batman similarly says to himself that he must keep up his work, for the sake of the promise he made to his parents years ago on the night of their deaths.</p><p>And on Christmas Eve Gilda is packing up boxes for her move away from Gotham, but before she leaves, she takes a box down the basement furnace. She describes aloud to herself how she read in Harveyâs case files about the removal of the serial numbers of guns and how baby bottle nipples could be used as silencers. She then removes from the box a .22 pistol and drops it into the flames of the heater, along with a familiar-looking hat and coat. And she claims that she took it upon herself to start the Holiday killings, in an attempt to end the Romanâs hold on Gotham and thus lighten Harveyâs caseload so that they could have a child Her belief is that Harvey took up the killings on New Yearâs Eve and that Alberto is lying to the police with his confession. She also says that she knows Harvey will eventually be alright and that they will reconcile, because she believes in him.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-37316\" href=\"/absolute-batman-the-long-halloween/4050-37316/\">Absolute Batman: The Long Halloween</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-36359\" href=\"/batman-the-long-halloween/4050-36359/\">Batman: The Long Halloween</a></li></ul>",

But the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55769\" href=\"/the-war-of-light/4015-55769/\" slug=\"the-war-of-light\">War of Light</a> has begun...</p><h2>Full Summary</h2><p>Following his defeat in Green Lantern: Rebirth, the events of Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 see the supervillain Sinestro retreat to the planet Qward in the Antimatter Universe. Here he amasses an army, the Sinestro Corps, that he selects based upon their ability to \"inspire great fear\". Each member is armed with a yellow power ring, mirroring the green ones of the Green Lantern Corps. Amongst Sinestro's allies are Parallax and the resurrected Anti-Monitor. The Sinestro Corps then launch an all-out assault against the Green Lantern Corps and the universe itself.</p><p>During the assault on Oa, the Sinestro Corps manages to inflict heavy casualties and free Superman-Prime and the Cyborg Superman from their imprisonment. Kyle Rayner is captured and transported to Qward, where Sinestro manages to separate Rayner from the symbiote Ion allowing Parallax to possess him.In Green Lantern (vol. 4) #21 the heroes Hal Jordan, John Stewart and Guy Gardner attempt to rescue fallen comrade Kyle Rayner, but are themselves entrapped, with Jordan transported to face Sinestro and his allies. A failed bid to rescue Jordan depicted in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #22 sees surviving members of the Green Lantern Corps forced underground and split into two groups. While one group attempts to free Jordan only to find themselves ambushed, the other successfully rescues Ion. They then re-unite with their ambushed comrades and together they escape from Qward back to the positive matter universe. Hal, John and Guy return to Earth to warn the Justice League of the Anti-Monitorâs return.</p><p>As the Sinestro Corps spreads out to ambush Green Lanterns across the universe, Green Lantern (vol. 4) #23 sees the Guardians decide to rewrite their sacred text, the Book of Oa. They remove a section devoted to a prophecy concerning the âBlackest Nightâ, against the objections of two of their number, Ganthet and Sayd. They then add 10 new laws, the first of which authorizes the use of lethal force against the Sinestro Corps, while Ganthet and Sayd are expelled from Oa. As the Green Lanterns gather on Oa in preparation for a Sinestro Corps assault, the Sinestro Corps teleport themselves and their Central Power Battery instead to a new Warworld, their objective revealed to be Earth. Events in Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #16 show Hal informing the Green Lantern Corps of Sinestro's plans.</p><p>Green Lantern (vol. 4) #24 continues the story, with Green Lanterns and Sinestro Corps members battling across Earth. Hal manages to free Kyle from Parallax before the entity is imprisoned in their power batteries by Ganthet and Sayd. After John and Guy arrive, the former Guardians reveal to them the prophecy of the âBlackest Nightâ, seen in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25. It foretells of five more Corps arising, each based on a different color and emotion. After the five corps are established, a \"War of Light\" will ensue, in which all the corps are destroyed, leading to the âBlackest Nightâ.</p><p>The Guardians arrive on Earth and appoint Sodam Yat to be the new Ion. After a lengthy struggle in New York, the Sinestro Corps are defeated by the overwhelming numbers against them. One of the Guardians sacrifices himself to send Superman-Prime to an alternate universe, while Hal and Kyle subdue and arrest Sinestro in Coast City. In the aftermath of the battle, seen in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25, the Guardians decide to bring the second of the new laws into affect. After realizing that the \"Blackest Night\" prophecy will come to pass, Ganthet and Sayd depart after creating a blue power ring with the intention of creating their own Corps, based on the spreading of Hope to the rest of the universe. The Anti-Monitor, having been blown across the vacuum of space at the battle's climax, finds itself on a dark planet. Here it is transformed by an unknown force into a Black Power Battery.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-32780\" href=\"/green-lantern-the-sinestro-corps-war/4050-32780/\" slug=\"green-lantern-the-sinestro-corps-war\">Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-38955\" href=\"/green-lantern-tales-of-the-sinestro-corps/4050-38955/\" slug=\"green-lantern-tales-of-the-sinestro-corps\">Green Lantern: Tales of the Sinestro Corps</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289590\" href=\"/green-lantern-sonderband-/4000-289590/\" slug=\"green-lantern-sonderband-\">Green Lantern Sonderband #7</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289591\" href=\"/green-lantern-sonderband-/4000-289591/\" slug=\"green-lantern-sonderband-\">Green Lantern Sonderband #8</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289592\" href=\"/green-lantern-sonderband-/4000-289592/\" slug=\"green-lantern-sonderband-\">Green Lantern Sonderband #9</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-289593\" href=\"/green-lantern-sonderband-/4000-289593/\" slug=\"green-lantern-sonderband-\">Green Lantern Sonderband #10</a></li></ul>",

Quentin (Kid Omega) decided on using the Phoenix's help to revive the deceased Cuckoo and so seeks her out. Problems arrose when the <a href=\"/shiar/4015-43138/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43138\">Shi'ar</a> discovered that they had not, in fact, destroyed the Phoenix Force (their earlier attacks had only managed to weaken it), and continue in their pursuit.</p><p><a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a> and <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a> went to stop them since they had to contain the Phoenix before it inevitably killed again in the machine Beast had created. Using Cerebra, Emma located Jean and the X-Men (Cyclops, Emma Frost, Beast, <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a> and <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde</a>) took the fight to her. <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a> stayed behind on Cyclops' terms saying that they couldn't have him pull his punches like before. Kitty and Peter said their good byes. Meanwhile, Jean had suceeded in separating herself from the Phoenix force and buried herself in ice, leaving the Phoenix to roam without a host in the form of Jean Grey. Arriving there Kitty uncovered that Jean was under the ice - but that's when the Phoenix attacked. Quentin Quire was getting closer to his goal but the corpse's hand kept falling which stopped him along the way. The Phoenix then revealed the true nature of her return, she wanted a power supply for herself and the beams in Scott's eyes were what she needed. The X-Men and the Phoenix force went on in an epic battle while Storm and Nightcrawler were trying to stop the Shi'ar agents. Scott came up with the plan of having Kitty kill him by crushing his heart, but the Phoenix kept talking of how much she loved Scott. His heart jumped by hearing this and asked Kitty to kill him. Emma stopped her by stepping into the rogue force's path and that's when Scott's heart truly jumped of joy. Emma reassured the Phoenix that she kept talking about love for Scott because she remembered what Jean wanted, but her emotions were merely an echo of Jean's. Emma then offered herself as a host of the Phoenix force. Kitty, who worried what this power could do to the former \"White Queen\", phased through Emma's body and put her hand around her heart. Scott told her to allow the Phoenix to take over Emma.</p><p>Emma, now struggling to control the power of the Phoenic Force was pushed by Scott inside the egg shaped machine Beast had created. The Phoenix and the beams from Scott's eyes had found their destiny, they were in equilibrium, but Scott and Emma were now stuck in there indefinately. Kid Omega liberated them both and the Phoenix granted Quentin's wish and revived the Stepford sister.However, Sophie refused Kid Omega and fell dead again. Jean Grey then came out of the ice and went against the force and pulled it out of Emma. They both bonded again in good terms allowing her to have control. Using Cerebra the Stepford Cuckoos showed Jean all the people that loved her and the people who miss her. The Shi'ar agents then attacked but Jean protected her fellow X-Men. In the end Jean took Scott into the <a href=\"/white-hot-room/4020-50483/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50483\">White Hot Room</a>, revealing herself to be the White Phoenix of the Crown - the most powerful incarnation of the Phoenix where host and force are utterly combined . As a last request she asked Scott to let her see his eyes and then said good bye.</p><p>The Stepford Cuckoos then were seen waking to the Phoenix's force in their minds.</p><p>Note: The events of what happen later with the <a href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\">Stepford Cukoos</a> happen in <a href=\"/phoenix-warsong/4045-51110/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-51110\">Phoenix: Warsong</a>.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/x-men-phoenix-endsong/4050-30233/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30233\">X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-phoenix-endsong-hc/4050-36138/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36138\">X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong HC</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/lyudi-iks-feniks-proschalnaya-pesn/4050-57118/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-57118\">Lyudi Iks.

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The series deals with alien villain <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a>'s plot to overthrow reality with the Anti-Life Equation, and the subsequent death and corruption of various DC characters and their universe.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p>Following the final battle of the <a href=\"/new-gods/4060-40647/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40647\">New Gods</a>, the spirit of the lord of evil, Darkseid, tumbles through time itself, coming to rest on Earth, where it, along with the spirits of the other evil gods of Apokolips, manifests itself in the body of a human being. Darkseid's \"fall\" has sundered reality, creating a singularity at the heart of creation, into which all of space and time are slowly being drawn, setting the stage for the evil god's final victory, to be claimed in his inevitable death. Through his agent <a href=\"/libra/4005-5044/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5044\">Libra</a>, he arranges for a huge army of super villains to be gathered, who capture and murder the <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\">Martian Manhunter</a> as the opening salvo of the conflict. Coinciding with the Manhunter's death is the arrival on Earth of <a href=\"/nix-uotan/4005-49070/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49070\">Nix Uotan</a>, an exiled member of the cosmic <a href=\"/the-monitors/4060-48220/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48220\">Monitors</a>, who has been sentenced to become human as punishment for failure in his duties.</p><p>Following the trail of a group of missing child prodigies, detective Dan Turpin discovers the dying body of Darkseid's son, <a href=\"/orion/4005-2363/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2363\">Orion</a>. The Justice League of America liaise with the Green Lantern Corps to investigate the murder, deducing the cause of death to be a bullet of Radionâa substance toxic to New Godsâfired backwards through time from the future. New God Granny Goodness, possessing the body of Green Lantern Kraken, stymies the investigation by framing <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a> for the murder; when <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> deduces her true identity, she captures him and teleports him to Command D, a government bio-chemical weapons facility beneath the city of BlÃ¼dhaven that has also fallen under the control of Darkseid's minions. Slowly becoming aware of the threat the evil gods pose, Alan Scott enacts \"Article X\", a super hero draft, that readies Earth's metahuman forces for the coming war.</p><p>With Batman and Jordan removed from play, the New Gods continue to eliminate the greatest threats to Darkseid's plan. <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> is infected by the Morticoccous bacteria by a Desaad-possessed Mary Marvel while investigating BlÃ¼dhaven. <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> departs for the future in order to obtain a cure for Lois when a bomb placed in the Daily Planet by Clayface mortally wounds her. The original Flash, Barry Allen, is resurrected from within the Speed Force by powers unknown, but then races back in time alongside Wally West, attempting to outrun the Black Racer, the Death of the New Gods, and stop the bullet that will kill Orion.</p><p>Turpin's search for the missing children leads him to the Dark Side Club, where he is confronted by Darkseid's human host, Boss Dark Side. The evil god transfers his essence into Turpin's body and brings him to Command D, where the detective is subjected to bio-genetic restructuring to transform his body into a replica of Darkseid's original form. Concurrently, Darkseid's agents release the Anti-Life Equation through all of Earth's communications networks, spreading it across the entire planet. The two Flashes, having failed to prevent Orion's death, emerge from the time stream one month after the equation's release, and discover that the minds of nearly the entire population have fallen under Darkseid's control, with its super-human victims having been transformed into a military force of \"Justifiers\".</p><p>With the help of the Tattooed Man, the Super Young Team and former allies of the New Gods Shilo Norman and Sonny Sumo, the small cells of super heroes who have managed to resist the equation discover a possible salvation: a symbol from the alphabet of the New Gods that will break the equation's control over minds, which was gifted to the cave-boy Anthro by Metron in prehistoric times. Meanwhile, a huge battle erupts between the superheroes and the Justifiers in BlÃ¼dhaven, during which the equation-controlled Wonder Woman infects the heroes with Morticoccous, which strips the heroes of their powers. However, the loss of these troops is soon mitigated by the turning of Libra's Justifiers, control over whom is usurped by Lex Luthor and Doctor Sivana so they can help defeat Darkseid. These twists and turns are observed by Nix Uotan, whose powers and memories of his true nature are unlocked with the help of Metron and a mysterious ape-like figure in a robe.</p><p>Escaping confinement in Command D, Batman uses the radion bullet to mortally wound Darkseid, before the dark god uses his Omega Beams to apparently kill the Caped Crusader. Superman returns to the present and tears Command D apart to recover Batman's corpse, and faces off against Darkseid as the Flashes come racing into BlÃ¼dhaven, the Black Racer hot on their heels. As the heroes reach superluminal velocity, time warps around the Flashes, creating the temporal eddy into which Darkseid fires the bullet, sending it back in time to kill Orion. Outpacing Omega Beams fired from the eyes of the humans in Darkseid's thrall, the Flashes lead both the beams and the Black Racer straight to Darkseid, finishing the job Batman had begun and bringing the touch of death to the god of evil. Simultaneously, The Ray traces the Metron symbol across the face of the Earth in beams of light, liberating all those under the equation's control; the freed Wonder Woman uses her lasso of truth to expel Darkseid's essence from Turpin's body.</p><p>Although physically bested, Darkseid's dying essence is still dragging all of reality into nothingness along with it. Time and space break down as the effect worsens, until eventually, only Superman is left in the darkness at the end of creation, struggling to complete a copy of the \"Miracle Machine,\" a wish-granting machine shown to him by Brainiac 5 during his trip to the future. Darkseid's essence re-emerges to claim the machine, but Superman destroys him for good by countering the vibrational frequency of his lifeforce with a counter-vibration. With Darkseid's end, however, the evil behind evils emerges: Mandrakk, the Dark Monitor, fallen father of Nix Uotan, who waits at the end of all things to consume what remains. Superman uses the solar energy in his own cells to power the Miracle Machine, and makes a wish that is granted by the appearance of an army of Supermen from all across the multiverse. Nix Uotan joins the clash, using his Monitor powers to summon the Green Lantern Corps, the Zoo Crew, the Super Young Team, the armies of Heaven itself, and more for a final battle with Mandrakk that culminates in the Corps spearing him with a stake created by the combined energy of their rings. The heroes drag Earth out of the black hole that is Darkseid, and Nix Uotan returns to being human as the other Monitors cease to exist in accordance with the wish Superman had made: a wish for a happy ending.</p><p>In the distant past, Anthro dies of old age in a cave. His body is discovered by Bruce Wayneânot dead, but sent back in time by the Omega Beamsâwho picks up where Anthro left off, drawing a bat symbol on the cave wall...</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/final-crisis/4050-30641/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30641\">Final Crisis</a></li><li><a href=\"/final-crisis-legion-of-3-worlds/4050-37177/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37177\">Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds</a></li><li><a href=\"/final-crisis-revelations/4050-27308/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27308\">Final Crisis: Revelations</a></li><li><a href=\"/final-crisis-rogues-revenge/4050-37105/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37105\">Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge</a></li><li><a href=\"/terror-titans/4050-38678/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38678\">Terror Titans</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/final-crisis-1-directors-cut/4050-22627/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22627\">Final Crisis Director's Cut</a></li><li><a href=\"/final-crisis-sketchbook/4050-27175/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27175\">Final Crisis Sketchbook</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/batman-legends-final-crisis-part-four-of-seven/4000-218686/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-218686\">Batman Legends #31</a></li><li><a href=\"/batman-legends-final-crisis-part-six-of-seven/4000-218688/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-218688\">Batman Legends #32</a></li><li><a href=\"/dc-premium-final-crisis-legion-der-3-welten/4000-287440/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-287440\">DC Premium #64</a></li><li><a href=\"/dc-universe-presents-final-crisis-part-1-of-7/4000-250097/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-250097\">DC Universe Presents #25</a></li><li><a href=\"/dc-universe-presents-final-crisis-part-3-of-7/4000-250092/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-250092\">DC Universe Presents #26</a></li><li><a href=\"/dc-universe-presents-final-crisis-part-5-of-7/4000-250088/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-250088\">DC Universe Presents #27</a></li><li><a href=\"/dc-universe-presents-final-crisis-part-7-of-7/4000-250073/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-250073\">DC Universe Presents #28</a></li><li><a href=\"/green-lantern-sonderband-/4000-289599/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-289599\">Green Lantern Sonderband #16</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292902/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292902\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #1</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292903/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292903\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #2</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292904/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292904\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #3</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292905/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292905\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #4</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292906/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292906\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #5</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292907/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292907\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #6</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292908/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292908\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #7</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292909/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292909\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #8</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292910/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292910\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #9</a></li><li><a href=\"/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/4000-292911/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292911\">PrelÃºdio Para A Crise Final #10</a></li><li><a href=\"/superman-legends-part-7-of-7-the-incredible-conclusion/4000-259466/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-259466\">Superman Legends #28</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>This issue begins with a flashback to when the Institute. <a href=\"/matthew-risman/4005-47984/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47984\">Matthew Risman</a> shoots at <a href=\"/prodigy/4005-40475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40475\">David</a> and the <a href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\">Cuckoos</a>, but while sneeking around, his face is badly injured by <a href=\"/dust/4005-4555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\">Dust</a>. <a href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\">Surge</a> cradles David as he's been shot, and Dust mutters \"Please forgive me.\"</p><p>Back in the present a <a href=\"/purifiers/4060-14915/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14915\">Purifier</a> asks Risman if he's okay, and after he replies affirmative, the Purifier tells him that <a href=\"/predator-x/4005-47143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47143\">Predator X</a> is alive, and it's hunting.</p><p>The Astonishing <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> team discuss the New X-Men, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> tellig the rest how well they've done since <a href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\">M-Day</a>. Cyclops tells them that there are twenty-five students left at the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Institute</a>, an eigth of the mutant population. He says that they don't even know the kids, but that ends today.</p><p>Next, down in the Med Lab, <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> fixes Dust's dislocated shoulder, while <a href=\"/pixie/4005-40673/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40673\">Pixie</a> tells them how she's a member of the New X-Men, how she can peform a spell and that <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-66486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66486\">Dr. Strange</a> said that he'd teach her more when she's eighteen. She proceeds to ask why Dust where's the burqa, commenting that she's really pretty. <a href=\"/gentle/4005-41124/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41124\">Nezhno</a> interupts correcting Pixie, and Pixie thanks him for saving her down in <a href=\"/limbo/4020-42990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\">Limbo</a>, but wonders why he had \"a spasm\". Nezhno reveals that when he activates his \"powers\" his strength increases, and soon the vibranium tatoos he has will no longer be able to contain his power, and he'll die. Mercury then pops in and asks the three how old they are.</p><p><a href=\"/anole/4005-40458/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40458\">Anole's</a> playing snooker, while <a href=\"/rockslide/4005-40456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40456\">Rockslide</a> (lava form) bugs him asking if <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a> can chop his other arm off. He refuses and Rockslide calls him a sissy. Anole is angered by this, and just then, <a href=\"/mercury/4005-15078/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15078\">Mercury</a> appears, with a question...</p><p>Mercury goes to <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir's</a> room, to ask him how old he is. But, he tells her how he can feel all cells aging and dying, but the question is can he stop it? She walks away to go ask David how old Elixir is.</p><p>Mercury knocks on <a href=\"/hellion/4005-40454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40454\">Hellion's</a> door, but suddenly the whole wall is blown back as is she. Turns out he was practicing using his TK, but he says that anything smaller than a fridge, and he can't deal with it. She asks them how old the Cuckoos are, and he replies they're really 2, and he asks why? She replies Matt Landru.</p><p>In Cerebra, the Cuckoos are scanning the world, while Mercury preceeds to tell them and Hellion that the youngest mutant is probably one of them. They decide to exclude <a href=\"/tito-bohusk/4005-48656/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48656\">Tito</a>, <a href=\"/molly-hayes/4005-1936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1936\">Molly Hayes</a>, <a href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Franklin Richards</a> and the Cuckoos from they're investigation. Then, <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a> opens the door, telling Mercury and Hellion to come to her office for a student-teacher meeting.</p><p>Outside, Beast and <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a> are waiting for Rockslide to arrive. Suddenly, Rockslide falls out of the sky above them, Anole pushing him down into the ground. Five minutes later, and Beast asks him to fire a limb, so that he'll explode and Beast can study him. He refuses at first, but when Anole calls him sissy,, he fires a limb and explodes. Beast thanks Anole, and both take shelter behind Colossus. Beast tells Rockslide that if he can hear him, try to feel the rocks and pull him together. He does so, and Beast says that he wants to see what'd happen if he reforms if he's smashed by someone else, and Anole fladly volenteers behind him</p><p>Surge goes around asking the students asking what happened to David in Limbo, and they all try to avoid it, but X-23 tells her what happened with excruciating detail.</p><p>She storms off while Pixie, flies behind her, telling her that she thinks that she and David are a cute couple. Cyclops and Wolverine show up, and Cyclops tells Surge that they need to talk, while Wolverine takes Pixie with him.</p><p>In Emma's office, she tries to talk to Mercury and Hellion, but they tell her that they think she's sad.</p><p><a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Shadowcat</a> tries to have a meeting with Elixir, but he tells her that he's thinking, and when she asks what about, he tells her a bunch of mumbo about life and death.</p><p>As <a href=\"/wolf-cub/4005-40640/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40640\">Wolf Cub</a> and <a href=\"/loa/4005-40672/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40672\">Loa</a> ponder whose the youngest mutant while eating, Pixie flies past behind them, Wolverine in pursuit, cursing the unicorns that he's seeing via Pixie's dust.</p><p>Most of the students are gathered in one room, wondering who the youngest mutant is. At first, it is said to be Wolf Cub, but then Mercury realises that Indra's name isn't on the list, and then he's revealed the youngest mutant. Meanwhile, in the same room, David tries to get Surge's attention, but she keeps ignoring him. And then she jumps at Hellion, and kisses him. Everyone looks shocked, and X-23 sheathes her claws, while Rockslide tells Indra that he's dead....</p><p>Back to the Purifiers, and they've planted a burqa of Sooraya's tied between two trees, and Predator X eats it, making Dust it's new target.</p><h2>Endangered Species</h2><p>At the Guthries, Beast and Dark Beast arrive, and Lucinda tells her kids to go and do they're homework. Beast preceeds to ask for a gene sample from her. Lewis, a son of Lucinda's goes outside, but is followed by Dark Beast. Dark Beast sees him acting as if he has super-powers, but Lewis tells him it's not a game, and tells him that he's waiting for his powers to kick in. Dark Beast tells him it ain't gonna happen, because of M-Day, but Lewis tries to remain optimistic. Dark Beast tells him it ain't gonna happen, unless he wants to try it from a different angle, offering him a small vile of liquid.</p><p>Back inside, Beast explains to Lucinda the situation, but she refuses to do it.</p><p>Back outsice, Dark Beast tells Lewis that he has to use his powers for good, and Lewis says he will, and he'll find his brother's killers and take them to jail. Lewis tells him that he's all for it, and Dark Beast tells him to role up his sleeve.</p><p>Inside, Lucinda tells Beast that she it's like waiting for her kids to be drafted into a war, and she continues to refuse. Beast tries to convince her , but then, one of the Guthrie girls come running in, telling her that Lewis is sick. They all run outside to see Dark Beast holding Lewis, Lewis's skin all pick and lumpy, with a pink fluid coming from his mouth.</p><p>The issue begins with a conversation earlier in the day between Cyclops and Surge. Cyclops congradulates Surge on how well she's done, bt she just tells him that it was pure luck. Surge asks him how he felt when Jean Grey died, and asks him if he could save her, even if it meant her hating him, wouldn't it be worth it?</p><p>Back to the present, Surge is still kissing Hellion. David runs off, and Hellion pushes X-23 away, scowling at her. He turns to -23, who runs away, Mercury shouting after her. Hellion then flies away, while Pixie asks Surge what they should do about Indra, but all she tells them to do is not to let him die. Rockslide calls first shift of babysitting Indra, something Indra wasn't that heppy about.</p><p>Predator X continues on his way to New York.</p><p>David is in his room packing away his things, and he is approched by the Stepford Cuckoos. They tell him that he only forgot what he learned when he had his powers, and they can restore the links. They continue to tell him that they wouldn't have offered if they hadn't thought his mind wasn't strong enough. He stares at a photo of the New X-Men, and he tells them to do it.</p><p>Indra and Rockslide are playing on a video game, and Indra thanks Rockslide for staying with him. Suddenly Rockslide explodes, and Indra armors up. Rockslide laughs at him for being so scarred, and Indra tells him he's going to bed.</p><p>Mercury goes into the Girls Bathroom, looking for X-23. She finds her there, and she's cut everything around her, and herself. She tells Mercury that she doesn't understand, but Mercury just quietens her, telling her everything'll be fine...</p><p>Outside, Hellion is sitting on the head of a damaged Sentinel. Dust arrives to talk with him. They talk for a little, and Hellion asks if Mercury sent her? She tells her yes, and he thanks her.</p><p>In Elixir's room, his skin turns from gold, to black.</p><p>Match is sitting in the middle of the room, with a marshmallow over his head, saying that he hates Rockslide. Zoom out for a panel of the group from the Quest for Magik issues, sitting around Match, Rockslide roasting a marshmallow on his head, all having a campfire. They all have they're little complaints, but Rockslide says that if they're going to go down, they should all go down together. He then ruins the moment when he says that they should start bonding, shouting \"Anole's gay!\", and Anole scowls at him. Beast enters the room, with new bulletproof costumes for all.</p><p>Surge if pouting in her room when David enters in his new costume. He tells her that he's staying, but she shouts random nasty things at him to try and get him to leave. She even goes so far as trying to punch him, but he blocks it, and puts her in a lock, and Hellion sees them through the doorway. Hellion slams him telekinetically into the ceiling, and then checks on Surge. David hits him in the face, back and face, and then tells him that he hit him with three parts of the human body that are essentially unbreakable, and he better go see Elixir about his injuries. David leaves and tells Surge that they're through.</p><p>On the Astral Plane, the Astonishing team share they're thoughts about the students, Shadowcat saying that she's worried about Elixir.</p><p>Back with the group, as everyone sleeps, we see Loa getting up. We see Dust, X-23 and Mercury having some sort of a slumber party, and Surge's room trashed, while David looks out a window.</p><p>Loa goes to Elixir's room, and tells him that she's been thinking, and asks him if he wants to make-out. Elixir's skin suddenly turns gold again, and he says \"Sure?\"</p><p>Cyclops tells the New X-Men that they might be the last generation of X-Men, and that if the X-Men are not there, Prodigy will fill in as a substitute teacher. He asks Surge if this is okay, and she says fine.</p><p>Predator X is approaching the Institute, but turns and head somewhere else. Mathew Risman shouts at the screen, but a Purifier tells him that maybe it's found a new target. Risman realises what this means, and tells the Purifiers that they have much more to do.</p><p>There's a pin-up in the back of the issue to fill in for the missing Endangered Species tie-in. It was a pin-up by Bryan Hitch of Mercury, X-23 and Surge.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-childhoods-end-the-quest-for-magik-childhoods-end-volume-5-the-quest-for-magik/4000-186544/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-186544\">New X-Men: Childhood's End: The Quest For Magik</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-34/4000-275100/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-275100\">New X-Men #34</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/new-x-men-35/4000-275101/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-275101\">New X-Men #35</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>In the lead up to the 100th regular issue of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\" href=\"/defenders/4060-26333/\" slug=\"defenders\">Defenders</a> comicbook J.M. Dematteis and his cohorts created a long series of adventures, fairly skillfully woven together tighter and tighter.</p> <p>The initial setup is that a series of supernatural adventures, guest starring sometimes long unseen Marvel Universe lesser characters, takes the Defenders through their paces, against a backdrop of the team having really bonded. They might not have had the Avengers charter and all the rest of the trappings but by this point the Defenders were a regular team in all but name- they hung out at Doctor Strange's brownstone in Greenwich Village, had a fixed roster, treated each other like a (dysfunctional) family, and so on.</p> <p>Juxtaposed with this were classic Defenders in-fighting, Kraft and Gerber era style darkness and offbeat tales, and a deep sympathy with the late 60s and early 70s contrasting the (as yet unretconned) pasts of some of Marvel's monster magazine period characters with the changes in the general Marvel Universe.</p> <p>Harking back to the Silver Age Marvel style, there were quotes from poems, pop culture references by the score, and some genuinely nasty supernatural elements. </p> <p>The story arc also debuted a character destined to be added to the team and pushed to prominence for a short time- the Gargoyle!</p> <p>All in all leading up to issue 100 it was good to see some sophisticated overlapping of stories for the first time in years. Opinion divides over whether the big reveal is big or credible enough a payoff...</p> <p>The source of the recent supernatural threats is shown to be, not beings like Thog, who are involved, but in fact the entity from whom the lesser evils take their existence- SATAN!</p> <p>Tired of seeing his son, Hellstrom, and his daughter, Hellcat, free and uncorrupted, Satan has contrived the whole involved plot- which included Strange unwisely using a teleportation spell which weakens reality, and many similar touches- to entrap his son and daughter and return them to their true destiny as scions of the netherworlds.</p> <p>The story arc touches on a lot of dark aspects, including incest, sin, damnation, drug addiction, crazed doomsday cults with Jewish and Christian overtones- in a sense, classic Defenders. In another sense, it was the watershed- after this the Defenders either had to be another Marvel cookie cutter team destined for action figures and general audience entertainment or pretty much permanently get sidelined in the new corporatised reality of comics.Â </p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-233494\" href=\"/essential-defenders-volume-five/4000-233494/\" slug=\"essential-defenders-volume-five\">Essential Defenders Vol. 5</a></li></ul>",

Attempting to gain the power to rescue Guinevere from the Queen of Bones, Lancelot allowed Merlin to transform him into a living gargoyle. After Guinevere had been saved, Merlin took vengeance on Lancelot for his and Guinevere's role in the fall of Camelot by imprisoning Lancelot in the stone body of the gargoyle, which was set on the roof of the convent where Guinevere would live out the rest of her life.</p><p>In the Butcher Knight series, Lancelot has returned to life in the present as Luther Washington, a reclusive painter who is still half-gargoyle, and who must consume the blood of demons to survive. Merlin still lives as well, as Barnabus London, head of a modern business empire. Luther finds himself allied with Daria, a seductive and ruthless witch seeking Merlin's power for her own purposes. The series concluded (somewhat abruptly) with the fourth issue. <br/></p>",

    "description": "<p>In the fall-out of Identity Crisis Barry Allen's (Flash II) old enemies Captain Cold and Mirror Master recruited Captain Boomerang's Son, Trickster II and, Weather Wizard to reform the Rogues. On the otherside re-formed Rogues Heat-wave, Pied-piper, Magenta and the Original Trickster had started working for the FBI in an attempt to capture the Rogues. They had gone as far as kidnapping the orignal Captain Boomerang and revieving his corpse for questioning. The Rogues attacked an FBI headquarters. While that was going on Zoom attacks Jay Garrick asking for his help. The former Rogues launch an attack on the Rogues home base. This leads to an all out <strong>ROGUE WAR</strong>. Wally quickly runs to Keystone City, only to find it in chaos, tornados, fire and lots of ice. Wally quickly outs the fires until he is caught in the cross fire between Heat-wave and Captain Cold. Wally stops to ask why the re-formed Heat-Wave attacked him and Heat-wave says \"You put out the pretty fire.\" Wally gets confused and is about to be attacked by Captain Cold when The Top shows up. The Top is another former rogue who didn't go good but knows a secret about the reformed villians that he intends to right. ( The Top knows what anyone who read Identity Crisis does that former heros such as Barry Allen with the help of Zatanna forced those and many other villians to re-form). The Top begins battling Wally until the Pied Piper shows up and puts The Top to sleep. Turns out The Top was just playing possum and quickly frees Pied Pipers mind. The Top moves on to the Original Trickster and frees his mind. The Pied-Piper quickly goes on a rampage claiming his heart is dead. Wally takes a risk and shows Piper his real identity and it works. Piper passes out and Wally takes him to his house and tells Linda to watch him. Captain Cold and Heat-Wave continue thier battle until The Top comes back around and frees Heat-Waves mind. This gets Captain Colds attention they banter back and forth then The Top revielies that he has brought his own rogues! The new kids include Grinder, Murmur, Plunder, Double Down and Tarpit. As The Top begins to claim victory Wally gets back hits him with a super fast right hand. The New Kids jump Wally at The Tops command ( All the new rogues are actually under The Tops control he is using his power of suggestion.) Captain Cold then freezes The Top and ends his life by smashing him into a tiny pieces. Wally kicks it up a notch and smashing up Grinders face and dumping him in a river. Wally then assembles a containment cell around Murmur, and beats down Double Down. Mirror Master calls in the reinforcements Dr. Alchemy and, Gorilla Grood. Gorilla Grood attacks Wally until Bart Allen shows up helping Wally get the upper hand. Together they return to take on the Rogues only to find something far worse waiting for them. ZOOM shows up dispatching the rogues easily and quickly grabs Bart by the necking telling Wally \"Just like Barry did to Thawne,\" with that the true threat is revealed... Eobard Thawne, Professor Zoom, The Reverse Flash. ZOOM rebuilt The Time Treadmill and captured Jay Garrick to go and get The Reverse Flash and bring him to the future to teach Wally a lesson. ( ZOOM grabbed him from moments before Barry Allen snaps his neck.) Wally jumps into action freeing Jay Garrick and Bart. Reverse Flash Attacks Wally and puts him on the Treadmill and ZOOM powers it up and takes Wally back to the worse day of his life the day ZOOM caused the miscarriage of his unborn twins. Wally was forced to watch over and over and over, until in a flash ( no pun intended ) Barry Allen shows up looking for Thawne. Barry quickly frees Wally and they go after thier counter parts Barry quickly captures Thawne and takes him back. ZOOM takes off and Wally gives chase ZOOM plans to kill Linda, Wally gives chase and at the last moment pushes ZOOM causing him to block the sonic boom he created that caused Lindas miscarriage. Zoom was then lost in the time stream on the trip back to the present. Upon returning to the present Wally is informed by Pied Piper that Linda is in the hospitial. Wally rushs there just in time to meet his two new kids.

The Brotherhood attacks Titan's Tower to capture Raven and when they get her, they torture her into telling them the secrets behind Brother Blood. Each Brotherhood member uses their power to torture Raven and they create the most unbearable torture sequence.</p><p>Thunder and Lightning appear in one of the issues when they come looking for Second Lieutenant Walter Williams. Within their search, they cause destruction to the city, which causes the Titans to attack back in return. The brother's search for Williams is a life and death situation for them. Unfortunately, the story is not completed because only the first issue that features Thunder and Lightning has to do with the Terra story arc, so it is not complete.</p><p>The body of Trident is found dead in the ocean. He had been killed with his own weapon and this leads to a murder mystery sub-story in the story arc.</p><p>There are two Titans that find themselves under the stress of the job. Wonder Girl is having a hard time keeping the team together. Everyone has something to complain about and she can hardly stand it anymore. These thoughts that she is having leads to thoughts of leaving the team. Kid Flash is also thinking ofleaving the team. Their last run-in with the Brotherhood of Evil almost made Raven kill him.

Sally is out at the time and they get to talking. Mark says that they have been engaged for a year and Vic leaves in anger and sadness.</p><p>Terry proposes to Donna.</p><h2>Hero Cameo's</h2><p>In issues #29-32, Speedy makes an appearance at the tower as a surprise visit, then ends up helping them fight the Brotherhood of Evil. He plays a comical role in each issue hitting on almost every woman he sees, being rejected by all of them.</p><p>Frances Kane returns to the Titans to find Wally. Her telekinetic powers have returned, but that is not what she wants. She finds Wally, scared about her powers, and wants to know if she can get rid of them. Her arrival is conveniant, though; moments after she arrives, the Brotherhood of Evil attacks. She is able to help only momentarily because she finds herself not to be as brave as all the other Titans.</p><p>At the beginning of issue #33, Aqualad is the one to discover Trident's body while sweeping the Ocean.</p><h2>The Animated Series</h2><p>The Terra storyline is the main premise of Season 2. The storylines are somewhat similar, but there is a difference in Terra's background and her time spent with the Titans. They also emphasize more on the love relationship between Terra and Beast Boy.</p><p>Thunder and Lightning are in the season 1 episode, \"Forces of Nature.\"</p><p>The Brotherhood of Evil is the Villan Group in Season 5.</p><h2>Comic Credits</h2><p>Marv Wolfman- Writer and Co-Creator</p><p>George Perez- Penciller, Original Series Cover, and Co-Creator</p><p>Romeo Tanghal- Inker</p><p>Pablo Marcos- Inker</p><p>Adrienne Roy- Colorist</p><p>John Costanza- Letterer</p><p>Ben Oda- Letterer</p><p>Todd Klein- Letterer</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-43796\" href=\"/new-teen-titans-terra-incognito/4050-43796/\" slug=\"new-teen-titans-terra-incognito\">The New Teen Titans: Terra Incognito</a></li><li>The New Teen Titans Omnibus Vol. 2</li></ul>",

But the Blue Blur arrives too late as Enerjak transports the civilian echidnas, which includes Knuckles's mom, step-dad, and baby half-borther; and then takes the Dark Legion's cyborg implants, declaring that his mission is to destroy all of technology. By the time Sonic reaches the power mad echdina, Enerjak teleports himself to the nanite-form city of New Mobotropolis, where he reaveal to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45382\" href=\"/chaotix/4060-45382/\" slug=\"chaotix\">Chaotix</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45381\" href=\"/freedom-fighters/4060-45381/\" slug=\"freedom-fighters\">Freedom Fighters</a>the echidna behind the mask is none other than Knuckles!

He tempted Knuckles with idea of using the Master Emerald's power in order to save last 10% of the echidna population since General Kage's take over. But what the guardian didn't know was that Finitevus had put negative-energy in the Emerald, allowing him to mold the new Enerjak's mind into doing one thing: Destroy all technology of Mobius!</p><p><br/>In issue 182, Enerjak declares that he'll free the people of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55453\" href=\"/new-mobotropolis/4020-55453/\" slug=\"new-mobotropolis\">New Mobotropolis</a> of the evils of technology, but Sally opposes from his rampage on Angel Island, NICOLE defends tech by stating how it gave her a chance at life, and Julie-Su begged Knuckles to stop from his past deeds with the Chaos Powers .

As Enerjak attacked Sahdow, Sonic knocks off the echdina's helmet and fond out that he was fighting his main man Knuckles! Not willing to fight, the Sally rallies the Freedom Fighters, Choatix and the civilians to charge Knuckles, only to be frozen still.

Meanwhile at the <a href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\">Helicarrier</a>, agents of <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D</a> are informing <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick</a> of all the things and disasters that are going on in the world, all in which he doesn't take seriously until he finds out about Luke Cages attack and that Cage is now in a Coma. Fury then visits Cage in the hospital who finds <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Danny Rand</a> aka Iron Fist and Jessica Jones. As Jessica question's Fury's reason for being there, a flashback occurs one year before. <a href=\"/killer-shrike/4005-12067/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12067\">Killer Shrike</a> (Simon Maddicks) is in custody after having been apprehended by <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> and <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>. In custody, Maddicks quickly finds out that the cops are Shield agents and after interrogating him violently, Maddicks quickly agrees to tell them everything. Maddicks leads Shield to his tech benefactor. Unfortunately Maddicks benefactor who is revealed to be the <a href=\"/tinkerer/4005-3144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3144\">Tinkerer</a>, who catches on to Maddicks betrayal and activates a booby trap giving him enough time to escape and results in Maddicks being seriously wounded.</p><p>Later the Shield agents raid the place but discover the tech of other super villains and four old passports with different names. Fury then gets a call from <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a> who tells Fury that she has found the Tinkerer in <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>. Fury later meets his superiors to notify them of the conspiracy he has found. Fury tells them about tech being made for various super villains that cost a lot more then the money they get from attempting to steal. Fury then reveals that the Tinkerer has been making tech for various super villains in the U.S but is getting funding him self from Latveria making the actions of the Super villains terrorism. Fury recommendation of action is rejected by his superiors who say that the United States has a good relationship with Latveria and wish to not take action but handle things diplomatically. Shocked, Fury storms out of the room where Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine asks him what is he gonna do? The story then continues to the present day as Fury looks over the body of Luke Cage and says \"What have I done\".</p><p>One year ago, Fury approaches <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> at his apartment resting after a mission. Fury requests for Caps help and tells him that it's \"Big\". Cap offers to assemble the other avengers but Fury says he needs this one to be a secret. Meanwhile elsewhere, <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a> returns to his office as Matt Murdock and smells Fury at his office. After recruiting Daredevil, Fury then meets Luke Cage who just busted a drug seller. Shortly after <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> swings back home to find Fury sitting down with <a href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane</a>. Fury then tells Peter that he needs Peter Parker and not Spider-Man.</p><p>The next day Peter goes to the airport and boards a plane and finds him self sitting next to Matt Murdock. The two are trying to figure out what is going on when <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> causes a scene at the back of the plane due to being drunk. His obscene behavior is put to an end by Steve Rogers aka Captain America. The plane then takes off and arrives at Latveria. The heroes Fury are recruited (except for Steve Rogers who goes off with the Latverian government) are greeted at the Latverian air port by Natasha Romanov aka Black Widow and with them another teenage girl follows, they all meet where Fury reveals him self to them. He then informs the heroes of the conspiracy he has discovered and tells them that he recruited them to help him overthrow the government. The story then continues to the present day, as Fury watches Luke sadly, Captain America burst in and punches Fury yelling \"Damn you for what you did to us!!!!!\"</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420879-10secretwar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-420879\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.88\" data-width=\"575\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 575px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420879-10secretwar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-420879\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16263/420879-10secretwar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420879-10secretwar.jpg 575w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16263/420879-10secretwar.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>In the present day, Peter Parker is having his anniversary with Mary Jane but keeps getting visions in his head of a fight occurring in Latveria involving him and the other heroes Fury recruited fighting soldiers with tech similar to that of previous Super villains. Peter who cant sleep because of the visions goes to visit Daredevil, they meet and Peter tells him about the visions. Peter also knows that the fight hes seeing happened in Latveria but he recalls never having been there before. Daredevil tells Peter that he knows nothing about the visions, Matt then gets a call from Jessica Jones who tells Matt that Luke is in the Hospital. As Spidey and Daredevil are about to leave they are ambushed by <a href=\"/diamondback/4005-25689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25689\">Diamondback</a> and <a href=\"/scorcher/4005-25579/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25579\">Scorcher</a>. Spidey and Daredevil make quick work of them and make their way to the hospital. Back at the hospital outside, Cap tells Fury how he was attacked outside his apartment by <a href=\"/hobgoblin/4005-7605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\">Hobgoblin</a> and <a href=\"/carolyn-trainer/4005-15649/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15649\">Lady Octopus</a>. The two are joined by Spiderman and Daredevil.

The heroes are then attacked by an army of super villains. Meanwhile back at the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute</a> Wolverine is drinking quietly until he is attacked. Back at the hospital, the heroes fight the massive amount of super villains as best they can. As they are about to be beaten, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> arrive and back them up but not long after the super villains tech suddenly malfunction and the energy is transferred into an Android Lucia Von Bardes. The heroes attack her under Fury's orders but are unable to penetrate her force field. Cap then orders the heroes to cut the line by damaging the tech worn by the army of super villains that she is getting her energy from. The plan fails however and Lucia charges up her energy to create a large explosion.</p><p>As Lucia charges her energy she yells angrily at Fury blaming him for everything. Before she can make her attack her mechanical heart suddenly explodes and after a backlash explosion she is defeated. The heroes pick them selves up and discover that the teenager named Daisy Johnson mentioned before one year ago had defeated her. The <a href=\"/black-bird/4050-29269/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-29269\">Black Bird</a> arrives with Wolverine and the other X-Men. Cap demands Fury to tell them what had happened one year ago on that present day which was the \"Secret War\". Fury reveals that the heroes he recruited helped him attack Latveria. The heroes who had been previously recruited fought there way to Castle Von Doom to confront the Prime Minister <a href=\"/lucia-von-bardas/4005-61288/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61288\">Lucia Von Bardas</a>. The heroes are surprised to find out that they weren't officially allowed to attack Latveria and are even more shocked as Fury orders <a href=\"/quake/4005-43174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43174\">Daisy Johnson</a> to bring down the whole castle which she agrees.</p><p>The heroes survive the destruction of Castle Von Doom but are disgusted at what Fury had done. Back in the present day, Spider-Man asks Fury why none of them remember this in which Fury reveals he mind-wiped them so none of them would remember and Cap only got back his memories when he did his regular Shield check up. Fury justifies his actions saying that he could not allow his superiors to do nothing and believed that what he did was the right thing to do. Wolverine flies into a rage for being mind-wiped again and strikes Fury directly and continue to slashes him. Wolverine then gets taken down by Daisy Johnson who explodes Wolverines heart knowing he'll live.</p><p>Daisy then reveals to the heroes that what Wolverine sliced was a <a href=\"/life-model-decoy/4055-42286/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42286\">Life Model Decoy</a> and that the real Fury had left several minutes after Lucia Von Bardas was defeated. From afar, Fury apologizes to the heroes for what he did through the LMD and says that they won't be seeing him again. The story later shifts to Daisy Johnson who is being interrogated by <a href=\"/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a> who is now the new director of Shield on the whereabouts of Nick Fury. Daisy tells her she doesn't know and is yelled at to leave. As Daisy walks on to the platform of the Helicarrier she gets a call in which she says \"yes sir\" leaving readers to believe that she does know the whereabouts of Nick Fury.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/secret-war-secret-war/4000-189760/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-189760\">Secret War HC</a></li><li><a href=\"/secret-war-secret-war/4000-193344/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-193344\">Secret War TPB</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/marvel-your-universe-saga-/4000-137832/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-137832\">Marvel: Your Universe Saga #1</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/die-offizielle-marvel-comic-sammlung-10-vol-33-sec/4000-438605/\">Die offizielle Marvel-Comic-Sammlung #10 - Vol. 33 - Secret War</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"/marvel-mega-/4000-292097/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292097\">Marvel MÃ©ga #19</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-mega-/4000-292099/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292099\">Marvel MÃ©ga #21</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-mega-/4000-292104/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292104\">Marvel MÃ©ga #25</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-pulse-/4000-297473/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-297473\">The Pulse #6</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-pulse-/4000-297474/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-297474\">The Pulse #7</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-pulse-/4000-297475/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-297475\">The Pulse #8</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-pulse-/4000-297476/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-297476\">The Pulse #9</a></li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/secret-war-1-secret-war/4000-293108/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293108\">Secret War #1</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/secret-war-2/4000-293109/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293109\">Secret War #2</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/secret-war-3/4000-293110/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293110\">Secret War #3</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/secret-war-4/4000-293111/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293111\">Secret War #4</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/secret-war-5/4000-293112/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293112\">Secret War #5</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/sekretnaya-voyna/4050-57129/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-57129\">Sekretnaya voyna</a> (Russia)</li><li><a href=\"/secret-war-de-los-archivos-de-nick-furia-/4000-293106/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293106\">Secret War: De Los Archivos De Nick Furia #1</a></li><li><a href=\"/secret-war-obra-completa-/4000-293107/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293107\">Secret War: Obra Completa #1</a></li><li><a href=\"/supereroi-le-grandi-saghe-guerra-segreta/4000-337554/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-337554\">Super-Eroi Le Grandi saghe</a><a href=\"/supereroi-le-grandi-saghe-guerra-segreta/4000-337554/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-337554\">#5</a><a href=\"/supereroi-le-grandi-saghe-guerra-segreta/4000-337554/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-337554\">: Guerra Segreta</a> (Italian)</li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Denial</h2><p>The story begins at an old Barber Shop at Lower East Side New York City where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a> meets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\" href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" slug=\"bucky-barnes\">Bucky Barnes</a> A.K.A. Winter Soldier. Wolverine tells Bucky that he doesn't believe that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America</a> is dead. He compares the Captain America's death to the Barber Shop \"things arent always as they seem\" due to the fact that the Barber Shop is really a secret <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" slug=\"shield\">SHIELD</a> facility. As Wolverine says this, Bucky clicks a button on the chair he is sitting on and which falls on to another floor. Wolverine follows Bucky down and tell him how not just Captain America but Bucky as well,was thought to be dead before back in World War 2. Bucky then asks Wolverine what he wants in which Logan says he needs Bucks help in getting to Captain America's body and identify it but Wolverine is turned down. Later at hells kitchen Wolverine approaches <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\" href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" slug=\"daredevil\">Daredevil</a> to help with the job that Bucky had turned down earlier in which he agrees. The two are able to get on board the SHIELD <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\" href=\"/helicarrier/4055-40700/\" slug=\"helicarrier\">Helicarrier</a> undetected and unseen with help from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\" href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" slug=\"doctor-strange\">Doctor Strange</a> who gives them a ten minute window. Before going to where Captain America's body is being held Wolverine instead goes to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\" href=\"/crossbones/4005-3225/\" slug=\"crossbones\">Crossbones</a> holding cell. Wolverine then puts a gun next to Crossbones and begins to interrogate him. After finding out that Crossbones did not get the kill shot,wolverine then taunts Crossbones and a in a fit of rage grabs the gun next to him and shoots Wolverine who strikes back almost killing Crossbones but is stopped by Daredevil. Wolverine then tells Daredevil to leave and makes his way alone to Captain America's body. Reaching there,he meets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\" href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" slug=\"iron-man\">Iron Man</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\" href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" slug=\"hank-pym\">Hank Pym</a> who both aren't effected by Dr. Strange spell. Wolverine confirms that Captain America's body is real and leaves knowing that Tony needs him to confirm Captain America's death to all those people who are in denial. As Wolverine leaves, he tells Tony that if he had anything to do with Captain America's murder, he would kill him.</p><h2>Anger</h2><p>The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-46148\" href=\"/mighty-avengers/4060-46148/\" slug=\"mighty-avengers\">Mighty Avengers</a> are on their way to stop <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6815\" href=\"/tiger-shark/4005-6815/\" slug=\"tiger-shark\">Tiger Shark</a> who possesses Gabriel's Horn which gives the user the power to control sea monsters. Tiger Shark has also used the horn to attack a top secret nuclear warhead installation. Meanwhile, Ben Grimm A.K.A.

The Thing is there to play poker with the New Avengers in attempt avert their minds from the Death of Captain America. As the Mighty Avengers arrive, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\" href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" slug=\"ms-marvel\">Ms. Marvel</a> orders them to fight of the sea monsters while she deals with Tiger Shark. Tiger Shark tells Ms.Marvel that he had attacked the facility in hopes of defeating the Avengers and not be a second stringer villain. At that moment the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\" href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" slug=\"black-widow\">Black Widow</a> is about to be crushed but is saved at the last moment by The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\" href=\"/sentry/4005-1454/\" slug=\"sentry\">Sentry</a>.

Spider-Man begins to continuously punch Wolverine causing Wolverine to unsheathe his claws but the fight is stopped by Ben Grimm telling them that fighting won't bring Captain America back. Spider-Man then leaves the Sanctum and Wolverine secretyly follows wanting to make sure Spidey arrives home safe. Elsewhere, Ms. Marvel savagely beats up Tiger Shark but is stopped by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\" href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" slug=\"namor\">Namor</a> who points out that she is beating Tiger Shark up to make her self feel better about Captain America's death. Namor then brings Tiger Shark back to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\" href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" slug=\"atlantis\">Atlantis</a> warning them that they will pay if the secret nuclear missiles were aimed at Atlantis.</p><h2>Bargaining</h2><p>Clint Barton A.K.A. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\" href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" slug=\"hawkeye\">Hawkeye</a> is at the Avengers abandoned mansion at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\" href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" slug=\"new-york-city\">New York City</a>. Clint shoots an arrow into the sky to signal for Iron Man who arrives quickly after. Iron Man who is shocked to see Clint scans him to make sure hes real. Clint tells Tony that he has called up Iron Man to talk about Captain America's death, Iron Man replies with a quick punch knocking Clint out. Back at the Helicarrier, SHIELD agents upon finishing tests inform Iron Man that that is the real Clint Barton. After waking up from being unconscious, Iron Man takes clint to a room which holds <a data-ref-id=\"4055-50737\" href=\"/captain-americas-shield/4055-50737/\" slug=\"captain-americas-shield\">Captain America's Shield</a>. Clint takes the shield for a test run and proves to be really good at it saying its all about accuracy. Iron Man then tells Clint that the world needs Captain America and offers him the role. Clint is at first reluctant but is convinced when Tony reminds Clint of the changes in costume hes made and that perhaps it has led to this. Elsewhere a Ninth Avenue Roxxon Gas Station is being robbed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12622\" href=\"/firebrand/4005-12622/\" slug=\"firebrand\">Firebrand</a> but is confronted by Young Avenger members <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2258\" href=\"/patriot/4005-2258/\" slug=\"patriot\">Patriot</a> and the new Hawkeye (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-2262\" href=\"/kate-bishop/4005-2262/\" slug=\"kate-bishop\">Kate Bishop</a>). Kate takes Firebrand down with a trick arrow that extinguished his fire while from a far Iron Man and Clint Barton watch and soon after Iron Man confronts Hawkeye and Patriot for violating the registration act much to Clint's dislike. Hawkeye not bothering to explain herself shoots Iron Man with a EMP arrow that shuts down the suit (for more, see <a data-ref-id=\"4055-50749\" href=\"/iron-man-armor/4055-50749/\" slug=\"iron-man-armor\">Iron Man Armor</a>). The two young Avengers then attempt to escape but are stopped by Clint Barton dressed as Captain America. Patriot and Kate who are offended by the impostor and demand an explanation but Clint defends him self saying that Kate had named her self Hawkeye. Kate, not knowing that the impostor is Clint, says that she took the name to honor the hero and if he was alive would call her self something else. Hearing this Clint feels remorse having used his old friends name and allows the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\" href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" slug=\"young-avengers\">Young Avengers</a> to escape as Iron Man arrives. Clint then tells Tony that he will no longer be Captain America and tells Tony that he deals with his grief by bargaining, hoping that with Clint as Captain America t pain would be less. As Clint walks away, Tony warns him that he will arrest him if he joins the New Avengers. Tony is then left alone in the rain, holding Captain America's Shield.</p><h2>Depression</h2><p>Following Peter Parker leaving the Sanctum after fighting with Wolverine, stands infront of his <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\" href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" slug=\"uncle-ben\">Uncle Ben</a>'s grave.

At that moment his Spider-Sense tingles and Peter finds the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\" href=\"/rhino/4005-2126/\" slug=\"rhino\">Rhino</a>.

Upon realizing that Captain America would not come to save him this time, Peter defeats the Rhino and is joined by Wolverine who had been stalking him since their fight wanting to make sure Peter gets home safe. Peter who wants to be left alone leaves Wolverine and goes to the bridge where Gwen Stacy had died. Wolverine joins him shortly after and tries to comfort Peter, but Peter says that Wolverine has no idea what he is going through. Wolverine then describes in words how Peter feels and then explains to Peter its called \"depression\" because its \"depressing\" but life gets better. With that Peter says \"Someday\" and swings away into the rain.</p><h2>Acceptance</h2><p>Thousands of mourners and fans have gather at the Nations Capital to attend the funeral of Captain America who's body is being buried in Arlington National Cemetery where Ben Grimm, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\" href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" slug=\"black-panther\">Black Panther</a>, Iron Man, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\" href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" slug=\"rick-jones\">Rick Jones</a>, Ms. Marvel, The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\" href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" slug=\"falcon\">Falcon</a> bring carry Captain America's casket.

Later, Tony speaks for Captain America but upon standing there can not bring him self to say the words and leaves saying \"it wasn't suppose to be like this\" in which Ben Grimm roles his eyes. The next speaker is Sam Wilson who tells everybody the honor he had in being Captain America's partner. Sam then asks everybody who was saved by Captain America in World War 2 and the heroes Captain America teamed with in World War 2. Sam then tells them how amazing it is that everybody here is of a different raise but have all been united by Captain America at this day. Elsewhere, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\" href=\"/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" slug=\"new-avengers\">New Avengers</a> watch the funeral on TV and are saddened by the idea that they could not attend their friends funeral. Three days later in the Artic, Iron Man, Hank Pym and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\" href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" slug=\"wasp\">Wasp</a> bring the real Captain America's body and reveals that the one in Arlington is fake for the public. As Tony tells Captain America the things he could not say in Arlington he is interrupted by Namor. Namor arrival was arranged to bring Captain America's body back to the seas where he was first found. Namor then swears that no one shall disturb Captain America's peace while he still rules the seas. Captain America's casket can then be seen sinking deep into the ocean.</p>",

As events begin to unravel, Hal Jordan as the Spectre is unable to focus clearly and tells his friend Green Arrow that something is wrong. Elsewhere two pilots encounter the resurrection of Coast City which was once destroyed by the Cyborg Superman and Mongul, and to add to the mystery the only building standing is Hal Jordanâs old home.</p><p>Elsewhere again, Kyle Rayner's power ring begins to warn that \"Parallax is coming\". Spectre (Hal Jordan) who is at Ferris Air Field reminiscing with his former lover Carol Ferris, is confronted by Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Zatanna, The Flash, and John Stewart on the sudden recreation of Coast City but Jordan denies any involvement. At that time, John Stewart suddenly loses control and attacks the other heroes while his rings warns that \"Parallax is coming\". Meanwhile, back at the Watchtower on the Moon, the emergency power ring that Hal Jordan once gave Green Arrow duplicates itself and places itself on Guy Gardnerâs finger and once again restores him as a Green Lantern.</p><p>At Highway Hill, the Green Lantern Kilowog arrives and suddenly attacks Kyle Rayner but the sudden appearance of Ganthet, one of the Guardians of the Universe, is able to stop Kilowog and protect the coffin, which it is revealed holds the corpse of Hal Jordan. Kyle feels something inside his ring that is attempting to control him while Ganthet engages in battle with Kilowog. In order to protect Kyle, Ganthet teleports Rayner and Jordanâs corpse to the Justice League Watchtower on the Moon. Meanwhile, Jordan returns to the newly reconstructed Coast City to investigate the appearance of his old apartment building. As he holds up his Lantern power battery he sees the reflection of his Parallax version. The Parallax version of himself confronts him saying that together they had brought Coast City back. Parallax then engages in a battle of wills with the Spirit of Vengeance bonded to Jordanâs soul.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420261-16GL.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-420261\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.8175\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420261-16GL.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-420261\"><img alt=\"The Spirit of Parallax confronts Hal Jordan\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420261-16GL.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/420261-16GL.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>The Spirit of Parallax confronts Hal Jordan</figcaption></figure><p>The Spirit then explains to Jordan the truth about Parallax, while at the same time on the Moon, Rayner does so to Green Arrow. Kyle had journeyed to the edge of the universe, and on the tenth planet from the star Pagallus, the inhabitants revealed that Parallax was a yellow demonic parasitic entity that was born at the beginning of sentience and fed on fear therefore creating terror in anything it came into contact with which caused entire civilizations to destroy themselves out of paranoia and fear of each other. The Guardians of the Universe then imprisoned the creature within the Central Power Battery on Oa. There Parallax laid dormant for billions of years, and his true nature was kept a secret by the Guardians to avoid anyone from trying to free it, and thus, it had eventually come to be referred to as simply âthe yellow impurityâ. Parallax weakened its power over the corresponding spectrum, therefore explaining the Green Lanterns' weakness against yellow.</p><p>However, Parallax was soon awakened and reached out to Jordan through Jordan's own ring when Jordan was at his weakest and spent years subtly influencing him. After the destruction of Coast City, Parallax was able to gain full control over the grief stricken Jordan and was completely freed. When Jordan destroyed the Central Power Battery it grafted itself onto Jordanâs soul. When Hal had become the Spectre, the Spirit of Vengeance drew in Jordan's soul, as it explains to Jordan, in order to eradicate the parasitic Parallax from it. All of a sudden Green Arrow and Rayner are then attacked by Sinestro, who explains that it was he who used his yellow power ring to tap into Parallaxâs power and awakened it, and that the Sinestro that was killed was an illusionary construct of Parallax, so that his murder would serve as the final stage of Jordan's transformation into the impurity in order to break his will.</p><p>The Justice League of America, Justice Society of America, and the Teen Titans arrive in Coast City and engage in a battle with Parallax but are defeated. The Spirit of Vengeance, however, manages to overpower Parallax, and removes the parasite from Jordanâs soul. Parallax then transfers itself onto Ganthet.</p><p>Back at the watchtower, Green Arrow and Kyle Rayner fight Sinestro but are unable to win. At this point Hal Jordan's fingers in the coffin begin to move and his white hair disappears. His thoughts clear for the first time in a long time, and Hal emerges from the coffin. Resurrected as a mortal human again, he tells Sinestro to back away from Kyle and Green Arrow. Sinestro and Hal fight each other and eventually Hal is victorious and forces the renegade back into the antimatter universe. Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kilowog return to Coast City and release Ganthet from the possession of Parallax. They then once again imprison the parasitic entity in the central power battery on Oa.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-49259\" href=\"/green-lantern-rebirth/4050-49259/\" slug=\"green-lantern-rebirth\">Green Lantern: Rebirth</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-37529\" href=\"/absolute-green-lantern-rebirth/4050-37529/\" slug=\"absolute-green-lantern-rebirth\">Absolute Green Lantern: Rebirth</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-32496\" href=\"/green-lantern-rebirth-1-special-edition/4050-32496/\" slug=\"green-lantern-rebirth-1-special-edition\">Green Lantern: Rebirth Special Edition</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-287414\" href=\"/dc-premium-green-lantern-wiedergeburt/4000-287414/\" slug=\"dc-premium-green-lantern-wiedergeburt\">DC Premium #39</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-290514\" href=\"/lanterna-verde-renascimento-/4000-290514/\" slug=\"lanterna-verde-renascimento-\">Lanterna Verde: Renascimento #1</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-290515\" href=\"/lanterna-verde-renascimento-/4000-290515/\" slug=\"lanterna-verde-renascimento-\">Lanterna Verde: Renascimento #2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-290516\" href=\"/lanterna-verde-renascimento-/4000-290516/\" slug=\"lanterna-verde-renascimento-\">Lanterna Verde: Renascimento #3</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-290517\" href=\"/lanterna-verde-renascimento-/4000-290517/\" slug=\"lanterna-verde-renascimento-\">Lanterna Verde: Renascimento TPB</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>At an unknown location, a group of international supervillains are gathered together under the behest of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/black-glove/4060-54825/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54825\">Black Glove</a>, led by<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doctor-hurt/4005-54826/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54826\"> Dr. Simon Hurt</a>, the man responsible for the isolation chamber experiment that <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> underwent and the creation of the three replacement Batmen. They are planning a danse macabre for Batman and arrange for the sending of an invitation to the villainous <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a>.</p><p>Back in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a>, Batman and his new girlfriend <a href=\"/jezebel-jet/4005-45542/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45542\">Jezebel Jet</a> receive an invitation to attend a party being held by the Black Glove, of which the theme is that of a danse macabre. This causes Batman to react in fear, as he believes that Jezebel (who has recently learned that Batman is Bruce Wayne) could conceivably be targeted for death by the Black Glove.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Commissioner Gordon</a> tries valiantly to convince a local newspaper into not running a story on a dossier that the publication has recently came into possession of. The dossier, allegedly compiled by a detective hired by the parents of <a href=\"/martha-wayne/4005-3603/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3603\">Martha Wayne</a> (Batman's mother), contains many shocking revelations: that <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/alfred-pennyworth/4005-5556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5556\">Alfred Pennyworth</a> (Batman's loyal butler/confidant) is Bruce Wayne's true biological father, that <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/thomas-wayne/4005-3602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3602\">Thomas Wayne</a> was a drunk who got his wife Martha addicted to heroin, as well as photographs of an orgy involving Thomas and Martha Wayne, Alfred, and the stars of a noir film \"The Black Glove\". The editor also tells Gordon even bigger revelations: that Thomas Wayne may still be alive and that the \"murder\" of his wife Martha was part of an elaborate scheme to kill his unfaithful wife and fake his own death.</p><p>The dossier itself is part of a larger game being played by the Black Glove and his League of Villains, of which Doctor Simon Hurt is leading in their campaign against Batman. Having drugged Batman with a slashing from a tainted blade, Hurt gives Monsieur<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/le-bossu/4005-55212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55212\"> Le Bossu</a> and his henchmen the gargoyles, the location the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batcave/4020-31340/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31340\">Batcave</a>.</p><p>As Le Bossu and his minions attack Alfred upon their entrance of their cave, Batman has the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batcomputer/4055-57354/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57354\">Batcomputer</a> analyze all known data he has on the Black Glove and Simon Hurt. The result Batman receives, just before he collapses due to the drug he was exposed to, is that the Black Glove is Zur-En-Arrh.....</p><p>An explosion occurs and Batman is dead. The scene changes and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Nightwing</a> is holding Batman's cape and mask. Both the Robin and Nightwing titles will be stopped and in their place will be a spin off of Batman R.I.P called \"<a href=\"/battle-for-the-cowl/4045-55808/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55808\">Battle for the Cowl</a>\".
