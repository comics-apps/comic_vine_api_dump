However, left behind in the present day he began to worry about Cable &amp; the baby. Cyclops had expected Cable's time travel to be instant; for his quick return with the baby. Therefore he asked <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> to locate where in the future Cable &amp; the baby were. Beast was able to create small portable time travelling devices, but prolonged use meant that the user's body would be begin to deteriorate &amp; die. Cyclops had each member of X-Force equipped with a time travel device, so they could be transported into the future the instant that Beast located Cable.</p><p>X-Force arrived in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>, over a thousand years in the future. They soon realized that they were stuck in the future, because an external force trapped them there. They quickly managed to locate Cable, but discovered that several years had already passed for Cable; the baby had grown into a young girl called <a href=\"/hope-summers/4005-49329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49329\">Hope</a>. Not only were Cable &amp; Hope forced to travel further &amp; further into the future to escape Bishop, but they had become embroiled in a conflict with <a href=\"/stryfe/4005-7616/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7616\">Stryfe</a> who had dominated humankind. Bishop had formed a tentative partnership with Stryfe, but refused to reveal the nature of his mission to kill Hope.</p><p>During an early confrontation, Hope was injured in battle. <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\">Elixir</a> used his powers to heal her, but through doing so he learned the truth about Hope. However, <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Archangel</a> suddenly flew off to pursue what seemed like his own agenda. Soon after, Hope &amp; <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Warpath</a> were kidnapped by Stryfe's forces. Despite being tortured, Warpath refused to reveal the secrets about Hope. Yet Stryfe was still a powerful telepath &amp; was eventually able to learn how Hope was seen as a new saviour for mutantkind. By removing his helmet, he was able to fool Hope into believing that he was Cable (his genetic twin).</p><p>Forced to work with a severely aged <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a>, X-Force &amp; Cable began to attack Stryfe, save Hope &amp; search for the cause of the chronal disruptor. Able to take Stryfe by surprise, they weren't able to defeat him. Stryfe was able to force his enemies to attack each other. He was only defeated by the appearance of <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse</a>, his adopted father. Archangel had found Apocalypse's dying body, and used the ancient mutant's technology to restore his strength. Apocalypse claimed Hope as his next successor, but Archangel demanded her return as payment for sparing Apocalypse's life.</p><p>Ultimately, Hope was returned to Cable and Stryfe was dragged away kicking &amp; screaming by Apocalypse. <a href=\"/domino/4005-2161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2161\">Domino</a> was forced to kill <a href=\"/kiden-nixon/4005-40702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40702\">Kiden Nixon</a>, who Stryfe had used to disrupt all time travel devices. However, Beast's time machines had already taken their toll on their bodies, and subsequent events forced Elixir to push his abilities to their limit. Left exhausted in an coma, Elixir was unable to reveal what he knew about Hope's true identity.</p><h2>Second Coming</h2><h3>Chapter One</h3><p>Hope and Cable return to the present, only to find The Xavier Institute in ruins. In Utopia, Cyclops states that with <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\">Selene's</a> attack, only 181 mutants are left on the planet. Mutantkind can't bear any more deaths. The <a href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\">Cuckoos</a> warn Scott that Cerebra picked a new mutant signature: Cable. Cyclops is sure that Hope is with him. He sends <a href=\"/vanisher/4005-6756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6756\">Vanisher</a> and Domino to San Franciso to wait for orders. He tells Rogue and <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> to stay and cover Utopia in case of attack. He puts the New Mutants in a holding pattern over the midwest aboard the Blackbird.

Cyclops and his Alpha Roster teleport to Winchester, but everyone is already gone. Scott emphasizes that nothing and no one is more important than Hope, and orders the X-Men to find her and bring her back to Utopia. Magik teleports the Alpha Roster right above the Sapien League's vans. The X-Men manage to beat them, and Wolverine asks one of them how are they tracking Cable and Hope. X-23 kills another one of them in cold blood to force the other to speak. Nightcrawler is outraged by Laura's killing. Psylocke is upset as she realizes Wolverine, X-23 and Angel are keeping something from the rest of them (During the story, the X-Force members imply they already know who are all those villains. Betsy, Kurt and Peter keep asking who are they, but the X-Forcers don't give them an answer.) Nightcrawler accuses Wolverine and Cyclops of knowing what this is all about.

Meanwhile Wolverine reveals X-Force's existence to the rest of the X-Men, which leaves Nightcrawler outraged. The Alpha Team contacts Cyclops via telepathy, and Scott tells Kurt not to question his leadership while the girl is not safe yet. Cyclops then orders Cypher to gather all the info he can get, and Doug ends up finding out about the market. Bastion tracks Cable's TO virus and sends Stryker and his Purifiers to kill Hope. Doug once again finds Cable and Hope's location at a hotel, and Cyclops tells the Alpha Team to follow them.

Wolverine tells Nightcrawler to teleport Rogue in Hope's direction, while the rest of the team will be following them: Angel flying; Logan, X-23 and Ariel in one car; and Colossus and Psylocke in another car. Back at Utopia, Pierce shuts down Cerebra. At the Right's HQ, Warlocke takes the life-force of Hodge and all his soldiers, killing all of them. The New Mutants then tells Emma how Bastion is tracking Cable and Hope. A fighter jet is sent to deal with the Alpha Team. It fires a missile, which hits their first car. Logan and X-23 will heal, Ariel won't. She dies. In Nebraska, the Alpha Team finally reaches Cable and Hope and warns him about how they are tracking them. Cable realizes Hope will only be safe away from him.

He asks Angel to prepare his body and Iceman to put together the religious rites. In the X-Prison, Donald Pierce fools Danger into thinking he's still locked, when in fact he's pretty much free. Bastions orders Pierce to destroy the X-Men's planes. He wants mutants to be stuck in Utopia. Later, Cyclops sends Cannonball's team to rescue Magik in Limbo, and the X-Club to figure out how to bring Bastion's towers down. Meanwhile, in the Sick Bay, Magneto wakes up from his coma and gets to know Hope better. By the time of Kurt's funeral, Beast arrives in the middle of the funeral procession and blames Scott for it. Everybody gathers around Kurt's coffin, as Iceman recites the lyrics of a song. Professor X, Storm, Beast, Colossus, Angel, Emma and Cyclops all remember Kurt with words, while his body is cremated.

Cyclops tells her that he did what he did to save everyone and Cable was aware of the situation. Hope still upset yells at Cyclops and still doesn't agree with what he's done.

Inside the dome, Cable, in full techno organic form, manages to keep the temporal door open long enough for the X-Force team to walk through it. He then looks at Hope and suddenly explodes, leaving only his metallic arm behind. Bastion, Lang and Creed watch from the top of a mountain as the time sphere collapses. Creed and Lang try to convince Bastion that the game is over. Bastion refuses to let the girl live, turns into battle mode, and flies towards the bridge. Hope remembers the moment she asked Cable how she would know when she's ready, and he told her she would know the same way she has ever known anything else. Cyclops tells Hope he's sorry and tries to put his hand over her</p><p>shoulder, when she replies that if he ever put his hand on her again, he will lose it because it was all his fault. Suddenly Bastion destroys the Golden Gate Bridge passing through it. Most X-Men falls into the water. Hope emerges from it, only to be confronted by Bastion, Lang and Creed, all in Nimrods form. They attack her, when, suddenly, she forms an armor. Bastion realises that her mutant powers just appeared, but he can't classify them, nor calculate them. Hope then blasts him with an optic blast he can't adapt to. Her hand turn into metal, and she punches right through him. As she remembers Cable's words, Hope touches the ground and forms an energy shield. Bastion says she is not the messiah, but the adversary, and that if she survives, nothing will survive. Hope turns into the Phoenix and blasts Bastion. Wolverine, Colossus and Emma are shocked. Logan tells Emma there's nothing she can do now. Bastion manages to grasp Hope's neck, and states that despite his original programming, he will take great pleasure in killing hope. Cyclops blasts his arm, and Wolverine jumps on him, killing him \"for Kurt\". Hope touches the ground again, saying she's ready now, going full Phoenix Force, and blasting Bastion and the dome all at once. The Avengers rejoices that Summers managed to pull it, while, in Utopia, every mutant just stares at Hope, levitating, like a true Phoenix...</p><h3>Chapter Fourteen - Final Chapter</h3><p><b>Chapter 1:</b> After destroying Bastion and the dome, Hope floats while every mutant gathers around her. For a moment, Xavier thinks this feels like his dream again, until it passes and Hope passes out. 30 hours later, Hope wakes up at the infirmary, where the X-Club is checking on all the wounded: Colossus, Archangel, Iceman, Karma, Magneto and Hellion. Hope asks Magneto if they think she’s dangerous, to what Erik tells her that sometimes is quite beneficial to be thought of as dangerous. Hellion interrupts the conversation between Hope and Magneto about whether Hope is dangerous or not. Hellion sarcastically comments that he would scratch his head and ponder it but he has no hands to do so. Magneto tells him to leave and he does but as he leaves he glares at them out of the corner of his eye.</p><p><b>Chapter 2:</b> It’s Cable’s funeral and everybody gathers around his coffin. Cyclops mourns the death of his son, crying. Hope says that her father lived as a true soldier, so nobody needs to cry for him, even though she cries too. Afterwards, the kids want to comfort Hope, but Prodigy tells them that Hope is all of them, so whatever they want to say to her, she already probably knows. Prodigy says that Hope, essentially, has every single mutant power. Cyclops tells Rogue that because of her they could be burying Hope, and that Nightcrawler and Cable’s deaths could of been in vain, so he demotes her: Rogue’s off of any strike team.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1298338\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.69659442724458\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1298338\"><img alt=\"The New X-Force is formed\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg 969w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The New X-Force is formed\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg 969w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60598/1298338-x_force.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The New X-Force is formed</figcaption></figure><p><b>Chapter 3</b>: Storm finds Logan having a beer in Kurt’s room.

He tells her that she’s off of X-Force and that it’s about time that she makes her own decisions. Finally, Wolverine meets Cyclops. Scott tells him about how Storm, Colossus, Iceman, and Xavier came to him to talk about X-Force. While Scott doesn’t have any regrets about what they did, he says there’s no place for X-Force in the future of the X-Men.

Her team-mates rescue her and Karma is kept alive by her costume stopping the loss of blood, due to it's unstable molecules. She is brought back to Utopia where she receives treatment.</p><h3>Ariel - Killed in Action</h3><p>After Nightcrawler was sent away with Rogue to find Hope, Ariel was brought in as the Alpha team's chief teleporter. The team started following, driving to Hope's location, with Ariel, X-23 and Wolverine in one car. However a fighter jet is sent by Bastion to deal with the team, it fires a missile which collides with their car. Wolverine and X-23 survive because of their healing factor, but Wolverine confirms Ariel as deceased. It has been speculated that because Ariel was in a door way, she managed to escape the explosion, but this remains to be seen.</p><h3>Nightcrawler - Killed In Action</h3><p>Nightcrawler was killed whilst defending Hope. To prevent Bastion from killing Hope, Nightcrawler teleported in between the two whilst Bastion had his hand on Hope's throat, this meant that after Nightcrawler teleported, Bastion's arm went through his chest. Nightcrawler then teleported himself and Hope to Utopia, with Bastion's arm still through him. Nightcrawler died on the island, and a funeral was held for him that night.</p><h3>Vanisher - Undetermined, Shot</h3><p>After Vanisher overhears Cyclops and Domino talking about Bastion targeting teleporters. He teleports off to his brothel in Portugal, only to end up ambushed by Steven Lang and his troops, who were informed by it's existence by Donald Pierce's spying on Utopia. They have killed all his 'girls' and proceed to fire at him, shooting him several times in the chest. Vanisher teleports away and it is not confirmed or shown whether he has died, but he was critically wounded.</p><h3>Hellion - Hands Destroyed</h3><p>During the Nimrods assault on the Golden Gate Bridge, Hellion is one of the mutants present fighting them off. During the fight, Hellions hand began to disintegrate from their attack, eventually causing him to lose both of his hands and most of his right forearm. He is currently in the Utopia Medical Wing.</p><h3>Sack - Decapitated</h3><p>Sack and a group of other mutants on Utopia were prepared to jump in and fight when Toad tried talking them out of it, pointing his finger at Sack. At the very moment that Sack tried to shame Toad for his cowardice, a Nimrod descended; firing at Sack &amp; decapitating him. Sack's head fell to the floor, a second Nimrod landed on Sack's head, crushing his skull.</p><h3><b>Cable - Killed in Action</b></h3><p>In order to save X-Force from being stranded in the future, Cable allows the Techno-Organic infection to take over him so he can open the portal connecting the present to the future, letting the members of X-Force through. The strain of the virus is too much and Cable explodes, leaving only his metallic arm behind</p><h3>The Human Council</h3><p>The mutant hating fanatics responsible for all the bloodshed also had their share of casualties.</p><p><b>William Stryker</b> - Bifurcated by Archangel</p><p><b>Donald Pierce</b> - Destroyed by a strong blast of Cyclops optic beam</p><p><b>Cameron Hodge</b> - Life is sucked from him by Warlock</p><p><b>Bolivar Trask</b> - Kills himself, knowing Bastion will soon re-assert his control over him.</p><p><b>Steven Lang</b> - Killed by Hope</p><p><b>Graydon Creed</b> - Killed by Hope</p><p><b>Bastion</b> - Killed by Wolverine and Hope</p><h3>Others</h3><p>During the fighting, many mutants were injured, some recovered later and re-joined the fight.</p><p><b>Surge</b> was badly injured whilst fighting the Nimrods, over using her powers to such a degree that her gauntlets short circuit, causing her pain and to collapse. She is taken back to Utopia, where her gauntlets are presumably fixed, and she re-joins the battle</p><p><b>Armor</b> was hurt during the first phase of the Golden Gate Bridge fight, the Nimrods used their expert technology to adapt to Armor's psionic armor and managed to breach it which caused her to collapse. However she was saved in time and went back to Utopia to recover, she later re-joined the fight.</p><p><b>Iceman</b> saved Armor from being killed by the Nimrods but was severely burned in the process, burning 25% of his body. He was brought back to Utopia and was put under medical supervision, whilst Beast looked over him. However he recovered extremely quickly, most likely due to his powers, and re-joined the fight against the Nimrods.</p><p><b>Magneto</b> awakens from his coma during the event and goes off to defend Utopia from the Nimrods, whilst the X-Men are away and he's still re-covering from his coma. He defeats the Nimrods, but is severely exhausted and is badly injured afterwards.</p><p><b>Toad</b> loses one of his fingers after a Nimrod blasts it off</p><p><b>Colossus's</b> arm is broken and ripped by the Nimrods, where several have to hold him back, while another snapped his arm. After Bastion was defeated, Beast helped mend it.</p><p><b>Cypher</b> is injured after he is found by Master Mold's main intelligence and tells him that he will not be a threat and can easily erase his mind. Cypher becomes overwhelmed by Master Mold and it seems as though his mind is going to be completely annihilated. Cypher however is able to trace the pattern of numbers Master Mold is using to destroy him and over ride their flow. He is able to over come Master Mold's hold and shuts him down completely. Later X-Force find him, he's unconscious but is still breathing.</p><p><b>X-23</b> was severely burned after trying to enter the portal back to the past, but the portal only allows in-organic matter to pass through, which causes X-23 to become extremely injured, her healing factor taking longer than usual to help her recover <b>Angel</b> was shown to be injured after Bastion was killed and the dome was lifted, his wings were damaged in the fight, he was in the infirmity for recovery</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/wolverine-by-jason-aaron-omnibus-volume-one/4000-295699/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-295699\">Wolverine by Jason Aaron Omnibus</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-second-coming/4050-35716/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35716\">X-Men: Second Coming HC</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-second-coming-second-coming/4000-272405/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-272405\">X-Men: Second Coming TPB</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-second-coming-revelations/4050-36045/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36045\">X-Men: Second Coming - Revelations</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lyudi-iks-210-1/4000-385186/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-385186\">Lyudi Iks #210</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lyudi-iks-211-2/4000-385187/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-385187\">Lyudi Iks #211</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lyudi-iks-212-3/4000-385188/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-385188\">Lyudi Iks #212</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-universe-secondo-avvento/4000-375666/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-375666\">Marvel Universe #4</a></li><li><a href=\"/patrulla-x-/4000-292844/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292844\">Patrulla-X #61</a></li><li><a href=\"/patrulla-x-/4000-292845/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292845\">Patrulla-X #62</a></li><li><a href=\"/patrulla-x-/4000-292846/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-292846\">Patrulla-X #63</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-/4000-300397/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-300397\">X-Men #121</a> (Germany)</li><li><a href=\"/x-men-/4000-300398/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-300398\">X-Men #122</a> (Germany)</li><li><a href=\"/x-men-/4000-300399/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-300399\">X-Men #123</a> (Germany)</li><li><a href=\"/x-men-/4000-300400/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-300400\">X-Men #124</a> (Germany)</li><li><a href=\"/x-men-sonderband-x-men-/4000-299686/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-299686\">X-Men Sonderband: X-Men #1</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-sonderband-x-men-/4000-299687/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-299687\">X-Men Sonderband: X-Men #2</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>Written by <a href=\"/garth-ennis/4040-40644/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40644\">Garth Ennis</a> and drawn by <a href=\"/steve-dillon/4040-23694/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-23694\">Steve Dillon</a>, this story arc also featured the beginning of Ennis' long working relationship with cover artist <a href=\"/tim-bradstreet/4040-3328/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3328\">Tim Bradstreet</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>At the beginning of the legendary Marvel Knights imprint Punisher arc, an older, wiser Frank Castle returns to the streets of New York yet with seemingly very little to his name. Moving into an apartment full of social outcasts under the alias of John Smith, Frank meets weedy punk <a href=\"/spacker-dave/4005-21167/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21167\">Spacker Dave</a>, morbidly obese <a href=\"/mr-bumpo/4005-21169/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21169\">Mr Bumpo</a> and scared, timid <a href=\"/joan/4005-21168/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21168\">Joan the Mouse.</a></p><p>Little do they know of his profession as New York's one time notorious vigilante and again soon to be, but Frank tries his best to remain antisocial and to keep his distance. The reason; he has just moved in on the Gnucci Crime Syndicate and killed two of <a href=\"/ma-gnucci/4005-21164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21164\">Ma Gnucci's</a> favourite sons.</p><p>On the case is laughing stock detective <a href=\"/detective-martin-soap/4005-21162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21162\">Martin Soap</a>, forced onto the \"Punisher Task Force\" so to keep him out of everybody else's way. But his luck could get better with the arrival of detective Molly Von <a href=\"/lt-molly-von-richthofen/4005-21163/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21163\">Richtofen</a>, who he falls hopelessly for. With her, Soap actually begins to get somewhere on the case, not that he would know what to do with the Punisher if he caught him.</p><p>In the wake of the deaths of her sons, Ma Gnucci begins to call in all the hitmen she can afford ending with the Punisher wiping out all of them and then the majority of her own collective family. When Ma goes after him, upon injuring Punisher in an ambush, he leads her army into Central Zoo and feeds them to assorted tropical creatures before feeding her to polar bears.</p><p>Angered, armless and legless, she calls for <a href=\"/russian/4005-41663/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41663\">The Russian</a>...</p><p>Ennis's debut take on Punisher is filled with so much comic hilarity, parody of 80's and 90's Punisher rip-offs and extreme violence along with touching moments between the characters that it's impossible to put the book down. Punisher's run in with Daredevil also leads onto future escapades where he literally punks the biggest street hitters over and over again in his quest for street justice. The fact that he is not superpowered in the slightest makes him a naturally prepared man and yet his permanent grumpiness is a pleasure to watch.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>Welcome Back Frank was one of two stories that influenced director Jonathan Hensleigh's 2004 version of The Punisher. Parts of the story was translated into the 2005 Punisher video game.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/punisher-welcome-back-frank/4050-37839/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37839\">Punisher: Welcome Back, Frank</a></li></ul>",

Spider-Man got caught in the middle of this as he tried to stop Electro, but he was criticized by the people for attacking their \"hero\". Electro made a deal with Dexter Bennett to pay for an operation that could cure his powers. If he accepted, Electro would call off his campaign. The Mad Thinker tried to cure him by increasing his electrical abilities, but Spider-Man interfered with the process, turning Electro into an artificial electrical thunderbolt. Spider-Man attempted to fight the upgraded Electro but was battered and beaten into unconsciousness. Electro double-crossed Bennett and told New York to turn on all electric appliances (thus giving him more power) to permanently end <em>The DB.</em> However, after Spidey woke up, he discovered that the Thinker has disappeared, and Spidey formed a new web compound out of the chemical goop that was used by Thinker to upgrade Electro's powers, he noticed that Electro \"flinched when he nearly got hosed with it\". Just as Electro was about to finish off Bennett, Spider-Man came to the rescue and used his new web compound as a battering ram that allowed his victory over Electro possible, but the <em>DB!</em> building was destroyed in the process and Bennett was crippled. However, it was a historic event as this building, once known as the Daily Bugle, is no more, which saddened Peter, Betty Brant and Mayor J.J. Jameson. After Electro's imprisonment, the Chameleon introduces him to Sasha Kravinoff, Kraven's widow and they join forces.</p><h2>Sandman</h2><figure style=\"width: 900px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/964415-3_amazing_spider_man_615.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-964415\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4355555555556\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/964415-3_amazing_spider_man_615.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-964415\"><img alt=\"Return of Sandman\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/964415-3_amazing_spider_man_615.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/964415-3_amazing_spider_man_615.jpg 900w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/964415-3_amazing_spider_man_615.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-width=\"900\"></a><figcaption>Return of Sandman</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Peter´s friend Carlie Cooper is accused of having lost important evidence in three murder cases and the city hall wants to blame her. As Peter works for the city hall he can't make up his mind about the situation. He finds clues that make him assume his old foe Sandman is involved. After investigating on his own, Peter finds out that all three murder cases can be connected in some way. But what is more, one of the victims had a child that is now missing. Exceptionally, this victim had a love interest in villains. Peter tracks down the Sandman to Governor's Island where he finds out that the Sandman has evolved in a way that puts Spider-Man into a big fight. The Sandman can now split up into different personae each with it's own mind. But he is not aware that he has killed anyone, and he loved the mother of the kidnapped child. He just kidnapped the girl because her mother didn´t want her to meet him, although she called him Daddy right after his first visit. She loves her \"Daddy\" and doesn´t want to leave. During the fight, the many Sandmen tell the real Sandman that they killed all the people after he felt asleep. Sandman can´t believe that and Spider-Man escapes with the girl. But as she is given in the care of an orphanage, she is desperately sad because Sandman was the best father she could have imagined.</p><h2>Mysterio</h2><figure style=\"width: 900px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/997983-113_web_of_spider_man_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-997983\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4366666666667\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/997983-113_web_of_spider_man_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-997983\"><img alt=\"Quentin Beck returns\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-width=\"900\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/997983-113_web_of_spider_man_4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/997983-113_web_of_spider_man_4.jpg 900w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/997983-113_web_of_spider_man_4.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Quentin Beck returns\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/997983-113_web_of_spider_man_4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/997983-113_web_of_spider_man_4.jpg 900w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/997983-113_web_of_spider_man_4.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-width=\"900\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Quentin Beck returns</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Next, an apparently alive and healthy Quentin Beck resurfaces, working with the Maggia in their ongoing gang war with Mr. Negative. Carmine, the consigliere of the Karnelli (formerly Manfredi) family, hires Mysterio to fake the return of important Maggia leaders, including Silvermane. Carmine hoped to take control of the Maggia, through the robotic Silvermane duplicate controlled by Mysterio, from the bumbling Don Bruno Karnelli. Soon, however, Mysterio kills Carmine and sets up most remaining Maggia members to be killed by Mr. Negative's gang while he escapes with the Maggia's vast fortune. While Mysterio made his escape, blowing up the opera house that was the site of the gang war's most recent standoff in the process, Spider-Man was able to catch Mysterio's fleeing boat and destroy it, along with the stolen money. Beck is later seen being approached by Chameleon, who is apparently organizing a revenge scheme against their longtime foe with other villains.</p><h2>Mr. Negative</h2><figure style=\"width: 600px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1028314-1_154f0d1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1028314\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1028314-1_154f0d1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1028314\"><img alt=\"Spider-man and Black Cat versus Mr.Negative\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-width=\"600\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1028314-1_154f0d1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1028314-1_154f0d1.jpg 600w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52045/1028314-1_154f0d1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man and Black Cat versus Mr.Negative\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1028314-1_154f0d1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1028314-1_154f0d1.jpg 600w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52045/1028314-1_154f0d1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-width=\"600\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-man and Black Cat versus Mr.Negative</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Due to the deaths of many of Maggia leaders, Negative was given the chance to finally crush the last remaining pieces who are foolishly being lead by Bruno Karnelli. <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">May Parker</a> accidentally witnesses Negative punishing one of his thugs and he used his touch to bend her to his will.

We then see Aleksei in front of a Butcher shop, where he stashed his old Rhino costume. Spider-Man tracks him down with a spider-tracer on his left sock. Aleksei wanted to become the Rhino and kill the new one in order to protect his wife. Spidey convinces him otherwise, telling him that if he does become the Rhino again, he will lose his wife and his old life will come back. Aleksei thanks Spider-Man and leaves with his wife. The new Rhino is revealed to be working for Sasha Kravinoff, and he is angered at her, she reveals that this was all a trial and that it is not over. He would later return and attack Sytsevitch and murders his wife Oksana. This forces Aleksei to re-take his mantle and fights the Rhino and manages to destroy his armor. Despite his pleas, Aleksei kills him.</p><h2>The Scorpion</h2><figure style=\"width: 690px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62014/1166733-asm_626__0008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1166733\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.0333333333333\" data-width=\"690\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:203.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62014/1166733-asm_626__0008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1166733\"><img alt=\"The New Scorpion meets Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-width=\"690\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62014/1166733-asm_626__0008.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62014/1166733-asm_626__0008.jpg 690w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62014/1166733-asm_626__0008.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The New Scorpion meets Spider-Man\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62014/1166733-asm_626__0008.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62014/1166733-asm_626__0008.jpg 690w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62014/1166733-asm_626__0008.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-width=\"690\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The New Scorpion meets Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/carmilla-black/4005-40706/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40706\">Carmilla Black</a>, the new Scorpion, who has taken up work as a superhuman mercenary, is sent to New York to retrieve the armor of the original Scorpion, now in the possession of <a href=\"/the-hood/4005-41917/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41917\">the Hood</a>.

After landing into one of Manhattan's parks, he was found by Spider-man and then by police,who delivered him into the inwood armory in Upper Manhattan. Spider-man found Juggernaut and asks who did this to him. Juggernaut described the appearance of the attacker, when suddenly the one they were talking about appeared - Captain Universe, with host being unknown. He attacks Spider-man and then throws the platform with Juggernaut into the Jersey Palisades. While Spider-man took care of Captain Universe, Juggernaut woke up and took out two policemen nearby. Noticing that his helmet was destroyed, he created another by using the Crimson Magic. He found Spider-man bound, and despite Spider-man's worst expectations, he doesn't kill him but frees him. Suddenly, Captain Universe appears again, wanting revenge on the Juggernaut. However, this time he was not so lucky as Juggernaut quickly handled him and was about to land a finishing blow. Spider-man tells Juggernaut not to kill Captain Universe, but the latter takes advantage of Cain's distraction and teleports them both to an unearthy realm. There he reveals his story and true identity to Juggernaut. In fact, the host was an office worker, <a href=\"/william-nguyen/4005-70676/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70676\">William Nguyen</a>, whose life was ruined when Spider-man and Juggernaut busted through the building where he worked.

He tried to use a mental assault on Juggernaut, but his helmet was an impediment. So William blew it up and threw him back to Earth. After telling this story, Juggernaut wanted to fight Captain Universe again, now in a fair fight. William teleported them back to Earth. While his original purpose was to repair tectonic plates that were damaged by Juggernaut, he decided to kill Juggernaut first, leading to the disappointment of Enigma Force. The repair must be done, and for that Captain Universe is needed. Absolutely surprisingly, Juggernaut becomes the new Captain Universe. Enigma Force choses him to repair the damage he did a long time ago. After fulfilling his purpose, Enigma Force left the Juggernaut and disappeared.

After getting a new job at a company called Phelcorp he begins to hear a voice (most likely the Lizard) telling him to behave violently. He finally cracks when his boss Brian King slept with his assistant whom Connors was attracted to. He felt himself turning into the Lizard again and tried to take a drug to halt the change, but Brian stopped him, believing he was trying to turn into the Lizard on purpose. Emerging, the Lizard devoured Brian. Spider-Man ran into Connors and fought him - while in his mindless Reptilian form, Connors kills his son <a href=\"/billy-connors/4005-6724/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6724\">Billy Connors,</a> which has the added effect of removing the presence of Curt in the Lizard's mind. Spider-Man, at the sight of Billy's death feels extreme remorse and fights the Lizard again who has developed the ability to control the Lizard part of the mind in other people, and he makes Spidey run away from the fight. Spidey goes to Phelcorp and drinks Connors' serum making him invulnerable to the Lizard's power. When he returned to fight again, Lizard has taken over the people in New York and chaos erupts. Spider-Man spits half the serum in the Lizard's mouth and injects a handful of syringes onto the Lizard, but he doesn't seem to be affected since the Connors personality was completely destroyed when Billy died. Then a group of civilians attack Spidey and are about to kill him until the Lizard saves him. Even though killing Billy and Curt have made him stronger, the emotions passed on to the Lizard have made him weak as he feels extreme remorse for what he has done. The Lizard then leaves after returning everyone to normal.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">These events set the stage for the <a href=\"/grim-hunt/4045-56152/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56152\">Grim Hunt</a>.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/spider-man-return-of-the-black-cat-spider-man-return-of-the-black-cat/4000-204468/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-204468\">Spider-Man: Return Of The Black Cat</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-the-gauntlet-electro-and-sandman/4050-32192/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32192\">Spider-Man: The Gauntlet: Electro and Sandman</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-the-gauntlet-juggernaut/4050-35046/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35046\">Spider-Man: The Gauntlet: Juggernaut</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-the-gauntlet-lizard/4050-35738/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35738\">Spider-Man: The Gauntlet: Lizard</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-the-gauntlet-rhino-and-mysterio/4050-32699/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32699\">Spider-Man: The Gauntlet: Rhino and Mysterio</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-the-gauntlet-vulture-and-morbius/4050-33404/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33404\">Spider-Man: The Gauntlet: Vulture and Morbius</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-38/4000-319576/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-319576\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #38</a> (UK)</li><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319578/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-319578\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #40 </a></li><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319579/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-319579\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #41</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319580/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-319580\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #42</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319581/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-319581\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #43</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319582/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-319582\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #44</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319584/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-319584\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #46</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319586/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-319586\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #49</a></li></ul>",

Norman solicits the President for an invasion of Asgard , and is infuriated by the President's refusal to invade. Loki goes out of his way to arrange some of the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-hood/4005-41917/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41917\">Hood</a>'s flunkies to create a disastrous situation. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/volstagg/4005-3513/\">Volstagg</a>, while roaming the Earth, ends up in Chicago, which is ironically, the home town of the President of the United States.

Without the President's approval, he invades Asgard with his <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/4060-55990/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55990\">Avengers</a>, members from the Hood's gang, the Thunderbolts, and a horde of evil. Once the invasion starts, Loki goes to <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/balder/4005-7201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7201\">Balder</a> to \"warn\" him of the incoming attack. Loki mentions he tried to stop Osborn, but he is too mad and corrupt to listen. Balder does not believe Loki, thinking that he is playing another one of his tricks. Just when Balder says he could not think of a human that could threaten the Asgardian Gods, the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/sentry/4005-1454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\">Sentry</a> flies through the walls, causing the castle begin to cave in. The next scene is Norman Osborn, with his Dark Avengers and an immense amount of backup heading for Asgard. The people down in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/oklahoma/4020-55803/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55803\">Oklahoma</a> begin to flee, knowing that this day would eventually come. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Dr. Donald Blake</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a> are looking after Tony Stark in his hospital bed. Hill looks out the window and sees Osborn's minions blanketing the sky. Blake realizes that he is not there for <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Stark</a>, but to attack Asgard. Hill orders the transport of Stark immediately, then runs outside, and then transforms into Thor. Thor gets close to striking, but the Sentry throws him out the opposite end of the castle. Osborn and his evil minions begin a vicious assault on Thor, beating him unconscious. All this is caught on live on t.v., and is seen by Steve Rogers, who is immediately readies for battle as <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/4005-1442/\">Captain America</a>.</p><p>At Asgard, while Thor is being beaten and bloodied, Norman Osborn begins to put Thor under arrest. Suddenly a missile strikes Osborn, hurling him miles away from Thor and his Avengers. The missile was fired by Maria Hill. She begins firing at Moonstone, and the Hood's gang. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/moonstone/4005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\">Moonstone</a> gets closer to Hill until Thor smacks Moonstone away with his hammer. Hill and Jason, a truck driver assisting her, help Thor to safety. Meanwhile at the Avengers hideout, Captain America holds a meeting with the Avengers including <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/stature/4005-40516/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40516\">Stature</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/speed/4005-40518/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40518\">Speed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/stonewall/4005-67274/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67274\">Stonewall</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/slingshot/4005-43663/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43663\">Slingshot</a>, and many other heroes.</p><p>On Asgard, Ares is battleing Balder, and tells him he is there because Loki had taken control of Asgard. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/heimdall/4005-3508/\">Heimdall</a> informs Ares him that is not the case. Learning the truth, Ares, realizes he must kill Norman Osborn. Osborn's lie forced Ares into battle against his fellow Asgardians.. Osborn sends the Sentry after <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/ares/4005-11940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11940\">Ares</a>. The battle ensues, but the Sentry is too much for Ares, and he is gruesomely torn in half.</p><p>In Brooklyn, as the Avengers prepare to go to battle, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky</a> returns Steve Rodgers' shield to him, saying the world needs Captain America. Nick Fury tells <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/phobos/4005-45219/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45219\">Phobos</a> he needs to stay out of the battle because of the severity of the situation.</p><p>In the Bronx, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/daken/4005-42501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken</a> is tracking Maria Hill's scent, and then begins to switch to look for Osborn. He finds him, and Thor fries him with lightning. Osborn is then struck by a fast incoming Captain America.</p><p>In Washington, the President is shown footage of Osborn's attack on Asgard above Oklahoma. He and the rest of the leaders decide to arrest Osborn for treason. The military is sent to Broxton to take down Osborn's army. Captain America is leading tthe Avengers to assist the Asgardian Gods. The Hood's Gang arrives, with The Hood being given the Norn Stones allowing him to increase his troops' power. The Sentry attacks just as Thor was beginning to get back on his feet. Thor swears he will defend Asgard with his life, while the Sentry allows the Void to take over. Osborn ordered Sentry to defeat Thor at any cost, so the Void could achieve a greater demonic form, and completely destroys Asgard. As Osborn is fighting Captain America, his armor system begins to be corrupted by Tony Stark who is wearing his classic armor from the 70's. All of the sudden, Osborn's armor breaks into pieces, shattering everywhere, revealing a Green Goblin mask. Osborn continues to say he was the only one who knew of the Sentry's ultimate power, and how to defeat him. Osborn says the heroes were doomed because of the where the Sentry's power levels were at. At that moment, the Void overtakes the skies above him, and all the surrounding heroes.</p><p>As the Void starts attacking the heroes, Loki realizes that what he did was wrong. He only wanted the throne of Asgard, and never expected the mortals to have such power. Loki then takes the Stones of Norn from the Hood and uses them to empower the heroes. The Void notices this, and attacks Loki. Just before he dies, Loki apologizes to Thor. Inspired by his brother, Thor starts mercilessly attacking the Void. Iron Man then asks Thor to get the Void out to the fields, and Thor does so, allowing Iron Man to bring the HAMMER Helicarrier down on the Void. This causes the Void to revert to Robert Reynolds, who begs the heroes to kill him. Thor at first refuses, wanting Bob to pay for his crimes, but Bob then starts turning back into the Void. Having no other choice, Thor then brings a massive lightning bolt down on Bob, killing him once and for all. Upon Bob dying, the Watchtower at Avengers Tower disappears. Thor then wraps Bob's body up in his cape, and flies into space. He then throws Bob's body into the sun.</p><p>In the aftermath of Siege, Norman's troops are captured and placed under arrest. Steve Rogers gives his shield to Bucky, saying that he should be Captain America. Afterwards Rogers is taken to the President's office, where he has a list of demands. One of them is for the Super-Human Registration Act to be abolished; the President complies.</p><p>The heroes then all celebrate at Avengers Tower, when a group of Asgardians, including Thor, arrive. Heimdall connects his watchtower to the top of Avengers Tower, signifying a new alliance between Earth and Asgard.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a

With Bruce Wayne gone in the wake of Batman: R.I.P., Dick Grayson — formerly known as both Robin and Nightwing — becomes the new Batman. And it's not long before the city's criminals put him to the test! With the Penguin intent on becoming Gotham's new crime kingpin and Two-Face waging a war of his own, how can any hero, let alone one who's just stepped into his role, stop them? It won't be easy — especially since he also has to round up a posse of escaped Arkham Asylum inmates.</em> <br/><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-34996\" href=\"/batman-long-shadows/4050-34996/\" slug=\"batman-long-shadows\">Batman: Long Shadows</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman </a>brings back to Earth an ancient Kryptonian device of unimaginable power called the Eradicator. After discovering that the device is attempting to recreate Krypton on Earth, Superman inactivates it.</p><p>Without his knowledge, the Eradicator affects Superman's personality, morphing him into a perfect Kryptonian being who is completely rational but who also despises anything associated with emotion. These new attitudes define Superman's, and Clark Kent's, reactions to those around him, including his ability to fight off alien assassins.</p><p>Superman must realise that Krypton's legacy is not his own, and that the wishes of a dead planet cannot define his future.</p><h2>Preceding Events</h2><p> After killing three <a data-ref-id=\"4060-52655\" href=\"/phantom-zone-inhabitants/4060-52655/\" slug=\"phantom-zone-inhabitants\">Kyrptonian criminals</a>, Superman is tormented by feelings of extreme guilt. He makes the decision to undergo a self-imposed exile in space, where he is forced to fight in gladiator games and where he encounters a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27019\" href=\"/cleric/4005-27019/\" slug=\"cleric\">Cleric</a> who gives him a Kryptonian artefact   called the Eradicator (see story arc <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56377\" href=\"/superman-exile/4045-56377/\" slug=\"superman-exile\"><i>Superman: Exile</i></a>). Superman's action attract notice of others, including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10034\" href=\"/maxima/4005-10034/\" slug=\"maxima\">Maxima</a> who sends her handmaiden <a data-ref-id=\"4005-63848\" href=\"/sazu/4005-63848/\" slug=\"sazu\">Sazu</a> to evaluate Superman's potential (See <i><a data-ref-id=\"4000-116346\" href=\"/action-comics-my-lady-maxima/4000-116346/\" slug=\"action-comics-my-lady-maxima\">Action Comics #645</a>).</i></p><p>Soon after Superman returns to Earth, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3213\" href=\"/jimmy-olsen/4005-3213/\" slug=\"jimmy-olsen\">Jimmy Olsen</a> begins to undergo an uncontrollable change, becoming similar to plastic man. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3770\" href=\"/emil-hamilton/4005-3770/\" slug=\"emil-hamilton\">Professor Hamilton</a> discovers that exposure of viruses Superman brought back from space to the Eradicator are responsible for the transformation, and Superman decides that for the time being the safest recourse is to bury the artefact at the South Pole. While there, the Eradicator begins building an enormous structure, and initiates plans to transform Earth into a new <a data-ref-id=\"4020-30670\" href=\"/krypton/4020-30670/\" slug=\"krypton\">Krypton</a>. After struggling to stop the Eradicator's machinations, Superman finally inactivates it by undergoing a Kryptonian ritual in an induced dream state (see <i><a data-ref-id=\"4000-31712\" href=\"/adventures-of-superman-solitude/4000-31712/\" slug=\"adventures-of-superman-solitude\">The Adventures of Superman #459</a>-461</i>).</p><h2>Main Story</h2><p>Undergoing the Kryptonian maturation ritual affected Superman more than he could have realised. He begins to see that rationality and emotion are opposing forces, that to be civilized means to overcome and destroy - without passion - everything that is primitive. Although he couldn't realise it, Superman's attitudes are becoming more traditionally Kryptonian, emotionless and logical; the persona of Clark Kent begins to fade into the background.</p><p>Superman's actions on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56267\" href=\"/warworld/4020-56267/\" slug=\"warworld\">Warworld</a> have ramifications that Superman could not have foreseen. One of the warriors Superman fought, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27749\" href=\"/draaga/4005-27749/\" slug=\"draaga\">Draaga</a>, is seeking Earth. Draaga desires a rematch, and an opportunity to regain his honour. In direct competition with Draaga is the alien <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6578\" href=\"/lobo/4005-6578/\" slug=\"lobo\">Lobo</a>, who is also heading to Earth to kill Superman and win a bet. And thirdly there is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10034\" href=\"/maxima/4005-10034/\" slug=\"maxima\">Maxima</a> who has heard of Superman's extra-solar exploits and who wants Superman for herself, for a mate.</p><p>Ironically, the same changes that are destroying Superman's identity are also saving him, and it seems unlikely that Superman could have defeated all of the incoming foes without the changes imparted by the Eradicator. The Eradicator allows Superman to invoke his mental powers to activate some of the Kryptonian machinery left behind in the Arctic and defeat Lobo. Similarly, the Eradicator's changes allow Superman to overcome Maxima's telepathic simulation.</p><p>These changes are paralleled by others: Superman is now identifying himself as a Kryptonian more than an Earthling, he garbs himself in Kryptonian costume, and he believes that Kryptonian evolution and culture are superior to all others; as a superior rational being, he must be mindful of the primitive nature of those that surround him.</p><p>It seems as if the soul searching Superman underwent while in exile was for naught: when Draaga requests to die in battle, with honour, Superman is not repulsed - it is logical to allow this primitive this wish. The only thing that prevents Superman from killing once more is an opportune intervention by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3770\" href=\"/emil-hamilton/4005-3770/\" slug=\"emil-hamilton\">Hamilton</a>, who uses his teleporter.</p><p>Even the Kents - <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3617\" href=\"/jonathan-kent/4005-3617/\" slug=\"jonathan-kent\">Jonathan</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3618\" href=\"/martha-kent/4005-3618/\" slug=\"martha-kent\">Martha</a> - can't get through to Superman, who now refers to himself only as Kal-El. It becomes clear that Superman has been affected by the Eradicator, and that he did not truly succeed in suppressing it previously. It is only when the Eradicator begins to disregard Superman's wishes, especially in regards to preserving the welfare of the Kents, that Superman realises he must struggle against it. Finally, with the help of Pa Kent, Superman is able to pacify the Eradicator.</p><p>Once more Superman finds himself in space carrying the Eradicator, but this time it is to destroy it forever. Superman casts the device into the sun, knowing that at the same time he is destroying another vestige of his heritage.</p><h2>Aftermath  </h2><p>Superman returns to Metropolis ready to resume his life, but he still needs to deal with the damage he's responsible for in the time since his return from exile. In particular, under the influence of the Eradicator Clark has been rude to the people who surround him, but aside from his parents, none of them know the reason why.</p><p>Also, Eradicator has proved itself as not merely a dangerous force, but a malicious one too. Although Superman assumes that he's been able to destroy the Eradicator, he is mistaken (see <a data-ref-id=\"4000-34451\" href=\"/superman-the-man-of-steel-man-of-steel-man-of-fire/4000-34451/\" slug=\"superman-the-man-of-steel-man-of-steel-man-of-fire\"><i>Superman: the Man of Steel</i> #1</a>).</p><h3>Effect on Superman mythology  </h3><p>This arc, and the events leading up to it, introduce for the first time (in the post-<a data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\" href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" slug=\"crisis-on-infinite-earths\">Crisis</a> timeline) Superman's base in the Antarctic, although it doesn't have an explicit <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41185\" href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/\" slug=\"fortress-of-solitude\">name</a> yet. The story also adds more to reader's knowledge of Krypton's history, including role of Superman's direct ancestors in building the Eradicator and thus being integrally involved in the bloodshed on that planet.</p><p>The changes undergone by Superman in these stories strongly define the character of Krypton, and suggest that Superman's role <i>as</i> a superhero is necessarily one of self-definition. That is, rather than Superman arriving on Earth as a superhero, this arc shows that he arrived on Earth merely as \"super\", and that the choice to become a \"hero\" was not a necessary one.</p>",

Since Spider-Man is a fugitive, he is unable to get proper help for May and he is forced to commit felonies to try and save his aunt before realizing that he has finally become what he has spent his life fighting, a criminal.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>Back in Black</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/98312-53196-aunt-may.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-98312\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5375\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/98312-53196-aunt-may.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-98312\"><img alt=\"Aunt May shot\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/98312-53196-aunt-may.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/98312-53196-aunt-may.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></a><figcaption>Aunt May shot</figcaption></figure><p>After the Civil War, Spider-Man is still a fugitive and goes on the run with his family. However, the Kingpin, now knowing Spider-Man's alter-ego, hires a sniper to track him down and kill him along with his loved ones. May and Mary Jane stay at a motel under fake names while Peter goes on patrol. Unknown to them, the Kingpin's sniper has them in his sights and waits for the Kingpin's order to pull the trigger. When Peter returns home, the sniper, targeting Mary Jane shoots but Peter's Spider-Sense has warned him and he manages to get MJ out the way. However, the bullet meant for MJ hit Aunt May instead and she bleeds intensely.</p><p>As Peter holds a bleeding Aunt May in his arms, two more bullets come in. Peter keeps on screaming \"No More!\" and heads out, picks up a jeep, and throws it at the building the sniper is at. Peter, still in civilian clothes, carries an unconscious and bleeding May to a hospital. After arriving at the hospital, Peter has been identified as Spider-Man and is prevented from assisting any further due to his status as a fugitive and he sits outside in extreme anguish. .</p><p>In prison, Wilson Fisk receives a message that only one of the secondary ones has been taken out. Fisk is pleased as he has prolonged Spider-Man's pain.</p><p>Peter meets up with MJ and tells her where May is and that she's been stabilized. He tells her to go and sign any papers and use May's maiden name at the hospital. When she asks him what is he going to do, Peter replies that he's going to hurt someone.</p><p>The sniper survived his encounter with Spider-Man and managed to escape. The police block off the building he was in but Peter appears, and after webbing up an officer who was trying to stop him, goes into one of the rooms where he spots the scope of the gun used in shooting May and it has a specific brand on it.

Peter brutally interrogates the last standing thug who tells him that the gun is very high end and very few dealers carry it. He gives Peter the names and address of four black market dealers.</p><p>At the hospital Mary Jane is told by the doctors that May is in a coma and the only things keeping her alive are the machines but sooner or later she is going to die.</p><p>Peter heads to a building and recovers a cloth version of his black costume as it represents his current state of mind. He wants to wear it to show this new dark side and he's willing to kill the ones responsbile for harming his family. Spider-Man tracks down the gun dealers and after threatening to kill the last one to throw him out of his penthouse's window, he is informed that the man who shot his aunt is named Jack Martino. Spider-Man goes to Matino's apartment and finds it empty but he is informed by the landlord that Jack left for Grand Central Station. Peter tracks him down there and mercilessly beats him but before Martino could tell Peter his employer's name, Martino is shot by another assassin. Spidey tags the fleeing gunman with a spider-tracer and follows the ambulance that took Jack to the same hospital May is at.</p><p>At the hospital, MJ tells Peter of May's current status and as Peter looks in on May, Jack dies on the operating table. However, Peter senses the spider-tracer nearby and finds the killer talking to his employer on his cell phone. He webs the killer's mouth, takes the phone and recognizes the voice on the other end: the Kingpin. Peter vows to kill the Kingpin but the latter is not intimidated. Peter then hangs up on Kingpin and continues interrogating the Kingpin's hired assassin. The man denies knowing anything about what happened with Peter’s aunt. Peter believes him but instead of killing him, he decides that he’s going to send a message. When he hears MJ coming, he swings off into the night with the thug in tow. Peter takes the hitman underneath the city in the middle of a sewer pipe where Peter tortures him until the man promises anything to be set free. Peter tells him to tell all the other criminals to stay away from his family or else he will hunt them all down</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/631535-amazing__542_art_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-631535\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.53125\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/631535-amazing__542_art_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-631535\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man goes after the Kingpin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/631535-amazing__542_art_medium.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/631535-amazing__542_art_medium.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man goes after the Kingpin\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/631535-amazing__542_art_medium.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/631535-amazing__542_art_medium.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man goes after the Kingpin</figcaption></figure><p>The next morning Peter is back in the hospital and MJ tells him that the cost of Aunt May’s care is substantial and since they’re paying in cash, they could soon be discovered. Peter reminds MJ of the time he gave his aunt a blood transfusion that saved her life and he plans on giving her another transfusion. After performing the procedure, Peter becomes tired and weak but despite MJ's protests, goes to Ryker's Island prison where a riot has been successful and the Kingpin, dressed in his classic white suit and holding his trademark cane, prepares to leave. Spider-Man infiltrates the prison and confronts Kingpin in the center of the prison block where the other inmates have gathered around them and Peter says \"End of the Road Fisk. You, Me, RIGHT NOW!\". The Kingpin, still unhinged by Spider-Man's anger, continuously taunts him, calling him a loser and a fool for following Tony Stark. Spider-Man then leaps at Kingpin and savagely beats the crime-lord who is unable to fight back against Peter's overwhelming strength. The Black clad hero tells Fisk that Spider-Man is not here to kill him because his costume opposes killing. Instead, Peter rips off the upper part of his costume, revealing his face and torso, and tells Fisk that Peter Parker is there to kill him. As he continues to brutally pummel the Kingpin, Peter tells</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/682321-spideyvskingpin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-682321\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.545\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/682321-spideyvskingpin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-682321\"><img alt=\"End of the road Fisk\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/682321-spideyvskingpin.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/682321-spideyvskingpin.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"End of the road Fisk\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/682321-spideyvskingpin.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12611/682321-spideyvskingpin.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>End of the road Fisk</figcaption></figure><p>him that he is nothing but a fat man with a bad attitude, a big balloon waiting to be popped by a needle, and Peter is that needle. An angered Kingpin attacks Peter who easily dodges all his attacks before hitting him with a powerful blow to the jaw. Kingpin is completely humiliated before all the inmates. Peter threatens to fill his lungs with webbing and suffocate him and after Kingpin tells him to just kill him and get it over with, Peter instead smashes him to the ground and tells him that he will kill him after May dies but for now he will leave him with his defeat which is, for Fisk in the story, more painful than death. Before leaving, Peter threatens the other inmates that he will kill them all slowly and painfully if they ever harm his family. Peter reunites with Mary Jane at Aunt May's hospital room.waits for the inevitable.</p><p>Peter continues to blame himself for what happened to Aunt May and discovers that the blood transfusion has failed. Then, the Parkers' cover is blown and Peter is forced to attack police officers and use questionable means to move May to a different hospital. That night, Peter has committed 9 felonies and after finally moving May to a new hospital under false names, Peter finally comes to the realization that he has become what he has spent his whole life fighting, a criminal.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/amazing-spider-man-by-jms-ultimate-collection-volume-five/4000-244450/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-244450\">Amazing Spider-Man by JMS Ultimate Collection Vol. 5</a></li><li><a href=\"/peter-parker-spider-man-back-in-black/4050-28590/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28590\">Peter Parker, Spider-Man: Back in Black</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-back-in-black/4050-27863/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27863\">Spider-Man: Back in Black</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-family-back-in-black/4050-33399/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33399\">Spider-Man Family: Back in Black</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/marvel-spotlight-spider-man/4050-21418/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21418\">Marvel Spotlight Spider-Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/spider-man-back-in-black-handbook/4050-18477/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18477\">Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook</a></li><li><a href=\"/what-if-spider-man-back-in-black/4050-25194/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-25194\">What If?

But before Red Skull can kill Bucky, Steve is able to force the Skull out of his mind and back into his robotic body, gaining control over his body again, and finally returning to the world he left. Sharon Carter then uses one of Hank Pym's size changer devices to make the Red Skull into a giant, making sure he can't escape this time, Steve and Bucky then team up with the rest of the Avengers, fighting the giant Red Skull, and finally are able to seemingly kill the Red Skull. As they do so, the public sees Steve among the heroes, and yell with joy as they see that Captain America has returned.</p><p>Back in New York, Steve remembers that he saw the future while he was going through time, and that he believes Bucky is going to die, but before he can think about it more, Sharon comes to get him to come down to his party.</p><p>Four days after his return, Steve had been training with Bucky, getting back into shape. He talks to Sharon, telling her how he's worried that he may slip away back into time again, she then tells him that he's not going anywhere and that she has him. Later that night, Steve decides to suit up and go out into the city, to see what has changed. He finds Captain America (Bucky) and Black Widow as they fight the Hyde who has escaped from The Raft. As Hyde tries to escape from the battle, Bucky sees Steve watching from the sidelines and throws him his shield, allowing him to defeat Hyde all by himself. Steve then says that was fun and hands Bucky the shield, but Bucky refuses telling Steve that he's Captain America and that's his shield.</p><p>Steve then tells Bucky that they need to talk. Steve tells Bucky that he should keep being Captain America, that it means something more to him, which Bucky disagrees with, saying that Steve is the only Captain America. Steve then tells him that he's not sure if he's ready or will ever be able to pick up his shield again, and asks Bucky to continue being Captain America, if not for himself, then for him.</p><p>Steve then returns to Sharon, telling her that he believes that if Bucky doesn't continue to be Captain America, that he may die, and Steve could never live with that possibility, even if it means giving up the future he wants. Steve then meets with President Obama, who gives Steve a Presidential Pardon for what he did during the Civil War, saying that he felt the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\" href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" slug=\"super-human-registration-act\">S.H.R.A</a>. was unamerican to him. Steve then tells the President that he may not be able to pick up his shield again, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56661\" href=\"/barack-obama/4005-56661/\" slug=\"barack-obama\">President Obama</a> then tells Steve that that is okay, that he has a feeling that in the coming days, America is going to call on Steve for something much bigger.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-265751\" href=\"/captain-america-lives-omnibus-captain-america-lives-omnibus/4000-265751/\" slug=\"captain-america-lives-omnibus-captain-america-lives-omnibus\">Captain America Lives Omnibus</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-32188\" href=\"/captain-america-reborn-hc/4050-32188/\" slug=\"captain-america-reborn-hc\">Captain America: Reborn</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-34795\" href=\"/captain-america-two-americas/4050-34795/\" slug=\"captain-america-two-americas\">Captain America: Two Americas</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-278681\" href=\"/deadpool-dead-head-redemption-deadpool-dead-head-redemption/4000-278681/\" slug=\"deadpool-dead-head-redemption-deadpool-dead-head-redemption\">Deadpool: Dead Head Redemption</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-291784\" href=\"/marvel-exklusiv-/4000-291784/\" slug=\"marvel-exklusiv-\">Marvel Exklusiv #86</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>In 1986, DC Comics published <a href=\"/the-man-of-steel/4050-3611/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3611\">the Man of Steel</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mini-series/4015-56281/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56281\">mini series</a> which retconned Superman's origin and history. In this version of <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>, he never started his career in his youth. The history of <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a> and his growing up to be Superman was erased from DC Comics' continuity. The post Crisis Superman from the Man of Steel mini series replaced the previous version of Superman. In 1987, Legion of Super-Heroes #37, Superman #8, Action Comics #591 and Legion of Super-Heroes #38 explained how Superboy was able to exist in the history of the DC Universe.</p><p> </p><p>The <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> discovers anomalies in history that does not coincide with their version of history including historical data about Superman. The <a href=\"/time-trapper/4005-25998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25998\">Time Trapper</a> seems to be responsible for manipulating the time stream (<em>See </em><i><a href=\"/cosmic-boy/4050-3597/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3597\">Cosmic Boy</a></i><em> mini series </em>and <a href=\"/legends/4045-40775/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40775\"><em>Legends</em></a>). </p><p> </p><p>The Legion decides to travel in the Time Bubble to confront the Time Trapper at the end of time. The Time Trapper diverts the Legion to Superboy's time period where some members of the Legion are captured by Superboy.</p><p> </p><p>The others escape in the Time Bubble several years into the future and land in Superman's time period. The Legion and Superman meet for the first time which confuses members of the Legion except for <a href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5</a>. Superboy is able to follow the Legion and captures them as well. </p><p> </p><p>Superboy brings them back to the past with Superman following him. Superboy and Superman battle in Smallville after arriving in the past. Superboy does not wish to fight anymore and explains his actions. Superman is returned to his own time period while Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes leave to battle the Time Trapper. </p><p> </p><p>The Time Trapper reveals he altered the timeline to create a pocket universe that contained the Superboy of an alternate Earth. Apparently, the Time Trapper diverted any travel by the Legion to Superman's early years to the Earth in this pocket universe. Thus, the Legion invited the Superboy from this pocket universe to be a Legionnaire. The Time Trapper created Superboy as part of a trap to destroy the Legion. </p><p> </p><p>The Time Trapper coerced Superboy's cooperation by saving his home and family from a destructive storm of energy that could still be released to destroy them. Superboy dies to save his Earth from destruction and to save the Legion from the Time Trapper. Time travel is also stopped until Brainiac 5 finds another way through time.</p>",

When Thor finally destroyed all of the Martians' tripods, he takes witness to an incredible scene as the gangs, dinosaurs, old planes, zeppelins, and even <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> himself transform New York City to a war zone. Meanwhile the Avengers Wolverine, Iron Man, Captain America and Noh-Varr arrive in the future in a cave in Central Park and look outside to bear witness to a gruesome all-destroying battle. But before they can get a read on the situation they are all knocked unconscious by the Avengers' children. When they wake up, they are greeted by an elderly <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> and Iron Man from the future, who apparently need something of the Iron Man of the present.</p><h3>Secret Avengers</h3><p>After <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a>'s <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a> and the Avengers is reformed, Steve Rogers formed a clandestine team of Avengers that will clean what Norman Osborn had left and any others that cannot be known to the public. Their first mission is to infiltrate<a href=\"/roxxon/4060-56010/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56010\">Roxxon Oil Company</a> that have set-up a dig site in <a href=\"/mars/4020-55781/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55781\">Mars</a> and are apparently looking for the <a href=\"/serpent-crown/4055-15780/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15780\">Serpent Crown</a>. Steve had <a href=\"/nova/4005-2105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2105\">Nova</a> scout the area but he had lost contact with him so he and his team go to Mars to investigate. When they got there, they find themselves attacked by the <a href=\"/shadow-council/4060-57698/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57698\">Shadow Council</a>. The team split up into groups to find Nova, the Serpent Crown and find out what has happened in the dig-site. Steve and<a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> find that the <a href=\"/worldmind/4005-51594/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51594\">Worldmind</a> is there but Serpent Crown is missing. They were attacked by the crown's guardian, the <a href=\"/archon/4005-72458/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72458\">Archon</a>. When <a href=\"/moon-knight/4005-1493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1493\">Moon Knight</a>, <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a>, and<a href=\"/valkyrie/4005-6809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6809\">Valkyrie</a> found Nova, he is wearing the Serpent Crown and has a group of Shadow Council soldiers digging for him in the field. Nova detected the Secret Avengers' presence and attacked them. Moon Knight and Black Widow are knocked out with Valkyrie fighting Nova in a losing battle. She contacted Steve for help and he rushed to her aid. When Steve, Beast and the Archon get to Valkyrie's position, she is incapacitated. The Archon attacked Nova but is gravely injured. <a href=\"/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">War Machine</a> and<a href=\"/eric-ogrady/4005-6774/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6774\">Ant-Man</a> goes into a abandoned facility to investigate when Ant-Man gets sucked into a portal returning to Earth in a Shadow Council base. He then sees a group of Shadow Council members with Nuclear Bomb vest going to the same teleporter with the objective to destroy the facility in Mars. Going in with them, Ant-Man fires a stinger in the Shadow Council's vest and prematurely detonates it inside the teleporter, destroying it. Back in Mars the Worldmind suggested that Steve must fight Nova using his powers but warns him that absorbing that much can be dangerous but Steve goes anyway. As he Steve puts on the Worldmind, he gains Richard Rider's power and becomes the new Nova. Nova (Steve) and Richard fight with Steve winning and he took off the Serpent Crown from Richard and he becomes normal again. The Archon thanked Steve for saving the Universe and left with the Serpent Crown to be kept in a more safer location. As they are going back to earth, <a href=\"/sharon-carter/4005-38227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38227\">Sharon Carter</a> communicates with Steve that the Shadow Council is headed by Nick Fury.</p><h3>Avengers Academy</h3><p>After <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn's</a> <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a> had corrupted &amp; destroyed what was left of the<a href=\"/the-initiative/4060-42781/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42781\">50 State Initiative</a>. With no official body to school or mentor young heroes, <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a> decided to fill the void that his name had been falsely identified with. However, after seeing the terrible deeds &amp; torturous methods that Osborn had inflictied upon unwitting young wannabe heroes, Pym &amp; the other Avengers quickly decided to focus their efforts on the kids who would most likely loose control of their powers in disastrous ways, or become villains.</p><h3>Avengers Staff</h3><p>The Academy staff were assembled. Founding Avenger Hank Pym &amp; veteran members <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> ,Tigra, and Justice as well as former New Warrior Speedball. Additionally, <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> &amp; other Avengers members would occasionally assist with guest lectures.</p><p>Despite Justice's reassurances, Pym remained dubious about Speedball's involvement. Memories of the <a href=\"/stamford-ct/4020-45571/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45571\">Stamford disaster</a> were still fresh in people's minds &amp; Speedball's personality had radically changed. However, Quicksilver pointed out that they had all experienced both sides of the law &amp; that he had only joined to distance himself from his father, since <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> had recently resurfaced in the public eye. This reminded Pym of his own violent past, so he conceded that Speedball still had a role to play in the new Academy.</p><h3>The First Class</h3><p><a href=\"/veil/4005-69916/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69916\">Veil</a> was the last of the new recruits to join the team. She'd grown to control her powers after being medically violated by <a href=\"/baron-von-blitzschlag/4005-42786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42786\">Baron Von Blitzschlag</a>. However, because of the premature intervention, her powers were slowly killing her. It transpired that she wasn't the only one who had suffered because of Norman Osborn's Dark Reign.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1260810\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.56796875\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1260810\"><img alt=\"Pym giving the students a speech\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg 1280w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg 408w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Pym giving the students a speech\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg 1280w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1260810-avengers_20academy_201_6.jpg 408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Pym giving the students a speech</figcaption></figure><p>Hazmat had been a bright &amp; popular girl until her new powers were accelerated. Her body became poisonous. Even her breath was toxic &amp; therefore she was forced to wear a radiation suit all the time. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/mettle/4005-69913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69913\">Mettle</a> &amp; <a href=\"/reptil/4005-60768/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60768\">Reptil</a> seemed to have adjusted to life in the Academy already &amp; were planning on who would become the team's field leader. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/striker/4005-69915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69915\">Striker</a> tried to assert his alpha male dominance by flirting with Veil, and the polymath <a href=\"/finesse/4005-69912/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69912\">Finesse</a> was as knowledgeable as she was skilled in martial arts.</p><h3>Hidden Agenda</h3><p>Many of the Academy staff were divided. After being raised in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Quicksilver felt that the students shouldn't be lied to, that they should be open about why these 6 students had been hand-picked. Pym disagreed, believing that psychology proved that kind of negative honesty would compound the issue &amp; make matters worse. Surprisingly, Speedball violently agreed with Pym by lurching at Quicksilver as he ranted. Therefore, the students were being lead to believe that they were hand-picked by the Avengers because they were allegedly the finest of the heroes discovered by Norman Osborn.</p><p>However, during her first team training session Finesse was able to lip-read the passionate debate through the observation glass in the training room. She confided in the other Academy students about what she'd discovered. Together, they decided to hack into Avenger's computers that night. Using Veil's gaseous form as a cover and Striker to short-circuit any electrical equipment, Finesse was able to hack into the system and read their dossiers. Quickly the returned revealed the truth; that their teachers were afraid of them. They were not the Super-Humans with the highest potential for success, they were the Super-Humans with the highest potential for destruction. Each and every student of Avengers Academy 'failed' their psychiatric evaluations and proved to be the most at risk for corruption into villainy or progression of mental instability.</p><h3>Gifted and Talented</h3><p>The next morning, the students are eating breakfast in dining room #38 of the <a href=\"/infinite-avengers-mansion/4020-56336/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56336\">Infinite Mansion</a> , when Reptil confesses that he has never kissed a girl before. Finesse offers to kiss him but before he gets gets the chance to do so they get attacked by <a href=\"/arsenal/4005-56297/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56297\">Arsenal</a> , a killer robot with super human strength. We learn that the robot was actually activated by Pietro and Jocasta to see how the students would react in a situation similar to the one they just encountered. Once the teachers leave, The kids debate over whether they should leave the Academy or not. After voting to stay, Finesse talks with Hank Pym, saying that she thinks she was adopted, and says she has a feeling she is be realted to Taskmaster, which Pym said he has a feeling about also. After watching a tape about Pietro's life, Finesse confront's Quicksilver, blackmailing him into teaching her everything he learned in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.</p><h3>Scared Straight</h3><p>While fighting robot drones in a training mission, Finesse gives Reptil his first kiss, which causes Hazmat to get all snippy about the situation, which provokes Mettle. Jennifer and Ken get into a minor verbal tussle which Justice quickly breaks up. They soon have a Hand-to-Hand combat class, taught by <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>, who shows the class that even though Finesse can replicate his moves, without the knowledge behind them and the proper spiritual training, that they are useless. 2 days later Valkyrie, supposed to teach them some fighting skills, teaches the women students of the academy about male opression in the society of women. Off on the side Hazmat and Mettle make up for their fighting and start talking about the upcoming \"Scared Straight\" field trip to the Raft, a prison for super villains. Jen knows that Norman Osborn ( The cause of her super powers ) is held there, so she plans something with Mettle and Veil for when they arrive at the field trip. Once the team arrives at the Raft, they are introduced to the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a>, and meet some pretty famous villains when Jen generates an electromagnetic pulse and all the lights go out. Mettle, Veil, and Jen run from the group, and arrive at Norman's cell not long after</p><p>.</p><p>Mettle rips off the cell's door and is ready to kill Norman, when Norman convinces them not to hurt him. Luke Cage is yelling at Hank for not knowing where Mettle, Veil, and Hazmat were. Hank figures out where they went, so they go to Normans cell, only to find Osborn sitting there, claiming that he will get out of prison sooner or later.Meanwhile, a super villain <a href=\"/powderkeg/4005-6824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6824\">Powderkeg</a> breaks out of his cell and starts attacking Mettle, Veil, and Hazmat. Man-thing and Juggernaut go after Veil, while Tigra, Hank, and Robbie fight against the inmates. Juggernaut gets to Mettle, and help defeat Powderkeg. Soon after, the power comes back on, and the three students are yelled at by Luke. Hank tells Mettle and the other two that what they did was wrong but it showed a lot of courage for them to just back down. Hazmat lies about causing the blackout, because she wants to meet Osborn again.</p><h3>Fame</h3><p>The Avengers Academy students are having an unarmed combat session with Steve Rogers. He shows them how important unarmed combat can be and how fatal it is. Striker gives Steve and Hank an attitude about not having any publicity for being on the Avengers Academy team. Steve notices that Striker is the only person who has ever become an avenger to be a celebrity. Striker asks both Finesse and Veil if they wanted to have sex with him individually, but they both decline.</p><p>Hank and the Academy later go to the city ( Manhattan ) to see a show and are attacked by Whirlwind. After defeating him, the team go back to the mansion. Veil walks in on Justice and his girlfriend ( <a href=\"/ultragirl/4005-40827/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40827\">Ultra-Girl</a> ) kissing and she is upset. Later Veil goes into Striker's room and wants to have sex but he doesn't want to at that moment.</p><h3>Thunderbolts</h3><p>In the Heroic Age Steve Rogers has decided to restart the Thunderbolts program as an opportunity to rehabilitate super-criminals. In order to do this he's asked Luke Cage to lead them since he managed to redeem himself and prove himself to be a hero when he was thought to be a dangerous criminal. They will be operating from a tower built into the Raft, the super maximum security prison for dangerous super-villains.</p><p>While the new team listened to a lecture from Luke Cage about how important the team was, outside the Raft, it seems as if Cage suffocates, while a ship appears out of the water, and <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\">Baron Zemo</a>, the original leader of the Thunderbolts walks out trying to recruit the members into his own team of Thunderbolts. Some members try to flee, others try to fight Zemo, but the result is that it was just a trick by the <a href=\"/fixer/4005-3282/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3282\">Fixer</a>, trying to see who was loyal to the team, and who needed some more help.</p><p>Luke Cage leads the team to the American Midwest, tasked with capturing Trolls escaped from the remains of the Norse Gods' fallen city of Asgard. Two of the savage creatures are brought down, but the third turns out to be a human. Crossbones tranquilizes the girl, and is given to the Raft to be imprisoned.</p><p>The teams next mission involves a squad of <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">Shield</a> agents investigating the<a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/4055-55807/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55807\">Terrigen Crystals</a>, A formation that produces mutagenic gas. When the agents go missing, the thunderbolts are called in to rescue them. The team find many dead bodies, and also many mutated Shield agents. The mutants hurt all but can't manage to hurt Crossbones, Man-Thing, and Ghost controlling Mach-V.</p><p>Man-Thing saves Moonstone from one of the mutated shield agents, while Crossbones accidentally inhales some of the crystals fumes. The team eventually regroups and Juggernaut seals off the cave. After a quick check up at the doctors at the Raft, <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a> and the <a href=\"/avengers-academy/4060-57354/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57354\">Avengers Academy</a> arrive to check out the Raft as a \" field trip\". Ten minutes after the Academy's arrival, the power shuts down in the raft and three of the students go missing. The team splits up to secure the area and find the children. Songbird goes to the women section of the Raft, and try to calm the women down, when the Troll-Girl( <a href=\"/troll/4005-72910/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72910\">Gunna</a> ) from there previous mission escapes her cell to aid Songbird.</p><p>After many fights between Luke Cage against <a href=\"/purple-man/4005-3227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3227\">Purple Man</a>, <a href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\">John Walker</a> ( The new warden of the Raft ) against male inmates , and Songbird and Gunna against women inmates, the students are found, and the power is restored.</p><p>A couple days later, after a phone call with his wife, Luke Cage talks to <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>, but soon kills him. It turned out to be a <a href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\">hand</a> ninja, posing as Iron Fist using magic. Cage soon strikes up a conversation with a man called Lacey Kimbro, who tells Cage that the Hand have taken his son, Darris. Kimbro said that Darris discovered the existence of members of the Hand that have been killed but are still living (the Underhand). Kimbro also says that Shadowland has an underground fortress where these beings live in a purgatory-like state At the raft, in the mess hall, female inmates are fascinated by Gunna, whom they call Troll. They tell Songbird that Gunna doesn’t understand English, but when they ask Songbird if the rumor that Gunna was a cannibal is true, she stops devouring her meal and says “aye”, surprising everyone. On the men’s side, an inmate antagonizes Crossbones thinking his nanites will prevent him from touching other inmates. During their meal, Crossbones grabs his hand, the back of which is discolored, presumably from the exposure to the terrigen crystals from last issue. On their way out of the mess hall, Juggernaut creates a distraction for Crossbones, who then shoves a plastic spork down the throat of the inmate who was irritating him.</p><p>The team then assembles and transports via Man-Thing to Hell’s Kitchen where they meet with Cage. He takes them to a sewer entrance and gives them their mission: find Darris Kimbro, and if there is an underground fortress, level it. Cage tells the team Fixer is the lead on the mission since Cage has other Shadowland-related business to attend to.

As Osborn had him hunted as a fugitive, Stark traveled worldwide on his quest to wipe out his mental database, going so far as to inflict brain damage on himself while revisiting scenes and people important to the Iron Man mythos. Osborn, wearing his Iron Patriot armor, caught up to the debilitated Stark, wearing his Mark-1 armor, and beat him savagely. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4263\" href=\"/pepper-potts/4005-4263/\" slug=\"pepper-potts\">Pepper Potts</a> is able to broadcasts the beating worldwide, costing Osborn credibility and giving Stark public sympathy.

Stark ends up in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55803\" href=\"/oklahoma/4020-55803/\" slug=\"oklahoma\">Broxton, Oklahoma</a> while people gather to determine Stark's fate.</p><h2>Detailed Plot Summary</h2><h3>Part One: Shipbreaking</h3><p>During the events of <a data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\" href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" slug=\"secret-invasion\">Secret Invasion</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\" href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" slug=\"skrulls\">Skrulls</a> had uploaded a destructive virus that targeted all <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56840\" href=\"/stark-industries/4060-56840/\" slug=\"stark-industries\">Stark</a> technology, from cellphones to the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56793\" href=\"/extremis/4045-56793/\" slug=\"extremis\">Extremis</a> armor. As a result, the name Stark became synonymous for failure, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\" href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" slug=\"iron-man\">Iron Man</a> himself was held responsible for the Skrull infiltration.

Her dismissal is met by snickers from her former colleagues, who are now H.A.M.M.E.R. employees (particularly a chubby agent named Walsh). At the same time, Tony is attempting to help with repairs from the Skrull invasion, but his inability to pilot the Extremis suit causes him to drop some debris, endangering the lives of the construction crew on-site. The construction people angrily tell him to leave, and we next see him with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4263\" href=\"/pepper-potts/4005-4263/\" slug=\"pepper-potts\">Pepper Potts</a> as he begins upgrading the repulsor tech in her chest that he put in during the events of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-29501\" href=\"/invincible-iron-man-the-five-nightmares/4050-29501/\" slug=\"invincible-iron-man-the-five-nightmares\">Five Nightmares</a>. Later, Tony is seen meeting with Norman Osborn, who asks him about the Superhuman Registration Database. Tony Stark promptly tells him that he can't just access it at his leisure, and that it requires warrants, probable cause, and a federal judge to draw up records.</p><p>Tony and Maria are then subject to a strip-search by H.A.M.M.E.R. personnel before they're able to leave the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\" href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" slug=\"shield-helicarrier\">Helicarrier</a>. Meanwhile, Osborn can be seen in his office, trying to access the Superhuman Registration Database to learn the identities of superheroes, only to find that all of his queries display no results. He gets angry and hurls his computer aside. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59261\" href=\"/victoria-hand/4005-59261/\" slug=\"victoria-hand\">Victoria Hand</a> and a H.A.M.M.E.R. agent come into his office to inform him that Stark left behind a virus.</p><p>In the final scene of the issue, Tony, Maria, and Pepper are in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55812\" href=\"/funtime-inc/4020-55812/\" slug=\"funtime-inc\">Funtime Inc</a>., eating Chinese takeout. Tony explains that he left behind the virus - but that it would only be triggered if Osborn was trying to access a phony database he set up (which means that Osborn was illegally accessing records). Then, Tony also explains how Extremis changed his brain into a computer, and reveals that he has hidden away the Superhuman Registration Database inside his own head.</p><h3>Part Two: Godspeed</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857916-picture2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2857916\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1835106382979\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857916-picture2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2857916\"><img alt=\"Tony hooked up to a repulsor terminal\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857916-picture2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857916-picture2.jpg 752w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857916-picture2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Tony hooked up to a repulsor terminal</figcaption></figure><p>Tony Stark is hooked up to a repulsor-powered station at Funtime Inc. He explains that his mind evolved to a hard drive as a result of Extremis, and says that there's all sorts of technology inside his brain that Osborn would want (e.g. how-tos for the Iron Man, Repulsor tech, personnel files for S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel). He then explains how the repulsor-powered terminal he's hooked up to allows him to access his brain directly, much in the same manner as an external hard drive. As long as he's hooked up to a repulsor-powered terminal station, he can delete everything inside his head, one brain cell at a time. This is to protect all of that information from Osborn, but unfortunately it also deletes Tony Stark himself. Memory, personality, and reflexes will all be deleted until Stark hits brain death.</p><p>Maria Hill gets angry at Stark's proposal and tells him that it's too drastic a measure. When Tony disagrees, Maria offers him a gun instead and asks him why he doesn't just shoot himself then. Tony then explains that it's not guaranteed that all of his brain will be destroyed by a bullet, and when Maria leaves angrily - refusing to take any part in it - he tricks her into activating her sequence. To delete his mind, Tony Stark split the sequence among three people (himself, Maria, and Pepper), and he manages to get Maria to activate hers by disguising it as a security pad. Basically, Maria couldn't leave the room without activating her part.</p><p>At the Chelsea Piers H.A.M.M.E.R. base, a H.A.M.M.E.R. agent informs Osborn that they've found Maria Hill. When Maria enters her apartment at Georgetown, Washington, she gets ambushed by H.A.M.M.E.R. operatives. After a brief struggle, she surrenders, and is promptly knocked out by one of the operatives. She awakes later to find herself in a H.A.M.M.E.R. craft. As one of the operatives tries to kill her, she knocks him out and attacks the craft's pilot. They crash-land into water and Maria escapes.</p><p>Back at Funtime, Pepper enters her portion of the sequence as Tony explains that he wanted the two people he trusted the most by his side when he made decisions like these. As the terminal begins deleting his brain, Tony experiences some minor pain. He then tells Pepper that he's abdicated his role of CEO to her and that there are papers in Long Island that need to be signed. He tells Pepper that Stark Industries needs to shut down.</p><p>At <a data-ref-id=\"4020-53342\" href=\"/thunderbolts-mountain/4020-53342/\" slug=\"thunderbolts-mountain\">Thunderbolts Mountain</a>, Osborn has called a press conference and announces that Tony Stark and Maria Hill had actionable intelligence suggesting that the Skrull invasion was imminent. He announces that the two of them were willing to negotiate for the Earth's safety (which is all lies). He then states that he wants both of them to turn themselves in immediately for questioning. Back at Funtime, Maria returns to Tony after her ordeal as he's fixing up his Renaissance Armor (Model 17, the one used during Heroes Return).</p><p>The issue ends with Pepper at Long Island, signing papers.</p><h3>Part Three: No Future</h3><p>At Osborn's press conference, he answers questions, stating that Tony Stark fled arrest and unleashed the virus that damaged H.A.M.M.E.R. systems, and that H.A.M.M.E.R. is repurposing the Iron Man technology for government use. Back at Long Island, a Stark employee details how Stark Industries is down to a skeleton crew and that H.A.M.M.E.R. has seized Stark assets and equipment. At Funtime, Tony tells Maria that she needs to go to Austin, Texas, to a Stark subsidiary called Futurepharm. He gives her a jump drive, telling her to plug it into any terminal at Futurepharm, which will lead her to a hard drive that she needs to take and give to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\" href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" slug=\"bucky-barnes\">Captain America</a> (then Bucky Barnes).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857917-picture3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2857917\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3289630512515\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857917-picture3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2857917\"><img alt=\"Mark 1616: Rescue\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857917-picture3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857917-picture3.jpg 839w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857917-picture3.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mark 1616: Rescue\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857917-picture3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857917-picture3.jpg 839w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857917-picture3.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mark 1616: Rescue</figcaption></figure><p>Tony then explains how he has to run around the world to all his different armories. Only the repulsor technology in either the Iron Man armors or his armories can delete his brain, and whenever these are activated it will leave behind a signature, so he has to run from one to the next. He shows her all of the suits that he has stored in Funtime. Maria and Tony then sleep with one another. At Long Island, Pepper is watching a broadcast of Victoria Hand saying that Stark has to turn himself in tomorrow morning - or he'll be considered a fugitive. Pepper then secretly finds a hidden entrance in Tony's office, which leads her to find a mysterious armor clearly designed for a female user.</p><p>The next morning, Tony fails to turn himself in, prompting Osborn to issue a warrant for the arrest of Tony Stark on the charges of crimes against humanity and treason against Earth. He then announces that H.A.M.M.E.R agents are raiding multiple branches of Stark Industries and seizing all of his assets that might aid Tony in his run. Stark offices in Chicago, L.A., Rome, Berlin, Hong Kong, Seattle, and Manhattan are all hit. At the Manhattan office, H.A.M.M.E.R. personnel search for Pepper, but they don't know that she has already don the armor and fled.</p><p>Back at Funtime, Maria awakens to find that Tony has already left. She finds a note left by him, telling her to activate the explosives that he has rigged all across his Iron Man suits in Funtime. She activates the explosives and flees.</p><h3>Part Four: Breach</h3><p>Pepper is flying in her new armor, and the suit's J.A.R.V.I.S. A.I. is activated. The A.I. explains that the suit Pepper is wearing is called the Mark 1616, and that J.A.R.V.I.S. is the interface that bridges her with the armor. J.A.R.V.I.S. also explains that the repulsor in Pepper's chest provides the power to the armor, and that she is the suit's perfect pilot.</p><p>In Los Angeles, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45756\" href=\"/anthem/4005-45756/\" slug=\"anthem\">Henry Hellrung</a> (formerly the superhero Anthem) is at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting as a sponsor. He then sees Tony, who has shaved his head and famous mustache off. Henry tries to convince Stark to turn himself in, saying that he's too high-profile to disappear, but Tony Stark disagrees. Henry then asks Tony why he's come, as he's made the church where the AA meeting was held a target, and Tony apologizes. Tony then explains that there's an Iron Man suit on the roof of the church which he'll use to flee. He then says that H.A.M.M.E.R will come busting in the moment he activates the armor, and tells Henry to tell nothing but the truth when he gets interrogated.</p><p>A flashback is then shown, revealing that Stark had set up a contingency plan in the event that the Stark Industries mail server was ever compromised.

Tony refuses, and then tells Jim that they have to 'battle' to ensure that Osborn doesn't think that War Machine is colluding with Tony.

Pepper leaves immediately when J.A.R.V.I.S. reports interesting repulsor activity in Russia as well as a grain silo explosion in Berkley, Massachusetts.</p><p>Back in Russia, Dmitri and Tony are talking as Tony explains his situation. Dmitri suggests that Tony throws himself into a volcano, vaporizing his entire brain in an instant, but Tony replies that it's not that bad yet. His Iron Man armor has been wrecked during the fight with Dmitri, and so he borrows the Crimson Dynamo armor to get to his next armory - in Kirensk. In Massachusetts, Rescue manages to save personnel from the grain silo explosion, and heads for Russia.

Iron Patriot is unable to locate Stark (as Walsh is feeding him bad intel on purpose), and he loses his temper. Gormley, Walsh's supervisor, learns about what Walsh is doing, and has him arrested. Gormley then takes over the intercom, and redirects Iron Patriot back to where Iron Man is.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857937-picture6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2857937\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0277161862528\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857937-picture6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2857937\"><img alt=\"Iron Patriot vs. Iron Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857937-picture6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857937-picture6.jpg 902w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857937-picture6.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Patriot vs. Iron Man\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857937-picture6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857937-picture6.jpg 902w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857937-picture6.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Patriot vs. Iron Man</figcaption></figure><p>Back in Avengers Tower, Pepper disables H.A.M.M.E.R. guards with the repulsor in her chest, and she, Maria, and Natasha make their way up to the 33rd floor to RV with Rescue, as well as retrieve the hard drive. Maria and Hill manage to get the drive. In Dubai, Iron Patriot finally locates Tony, and the two begin fighting. Tony's mind is nearly gone by now, and he's struggling to hold his own against Osborn.</p><p>Pepper, meanwhile, has managed to find Rescue and suits up. J.A.R.V.I.S. then informs Pepper that its informed the world's media outlets that Osborn is in Dubai, attempting to murder Tony Stark. The world's media flocks to Dubai while Maria and Natasha manage to escape Avengers Tower. As Iron Patriot is about to kill Tony, Victoria Hand suddenly tells him to stop, as the cameras are on him. Iron Patriot concedes, and Tony Stark's last words are: \"I win.\"</p><p>On the Helicarrier, the doctor explains to Osborn that Stark's consciousness is now-gone. His can still respond to stimuli, but his whole brain is damaged - even the part of him that knows how to breathe. Osborn then tells the doctor to pull the plug on Tony, but the doctor tells him that legally they can't, as the Helicarrier is a flying embassy. The doctor explains that Tony has a will, and that his power of attorney was given to his personal physician. Only Tony Stark's doctor can make the end-of-life decision.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857938-picture7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2857938\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.96994219653179\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857938-picture7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2857938\"><img alt=\"Maria, Pepper, Bucky, Natasha, &amp; Donald\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857938-picture7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857938-picture7.jpg 865w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857938-picture7.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Maria, Pepper, Bucky, Natasha, &amp; Donald\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857938-picture7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2857938-picture7.jpg 865w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2857938-picture7.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Maria, Pepper, Bucky, Natasha, &amp; Donald</figcaption></figure><p>In a motel in Broxton, Oklaholma, Doctor <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" slug=\"thor\">Donald Blake</a> receives a call about Tony Stark.

The mutants retreat into the mansion with the N'Garai hot on their heels. The X-Men make it to the mansion, and Kitty activates its defense systems, which proceeds to annihilate scores of the monsters with highly-advanced weaponry. Once inside, Kitty expresses her shock at how the world was invaded by their forces so quickly. Nightcrawler tells her that N'Garai cairns sprouted out of the ground on every continent, and from them countless monsters were unleashed onto the earth. No one was able to stop them, not the world's super heroes, nor the military, and it seemed that all hope for humanity was lost. <br/> <br/>Kitty is perplexed by her teammates' defeatist attitudes  <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1144447-blood_ceremony_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1144447\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.45792563600783\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1144447-blood_ceremony_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1144447\"><img alt=\"The X-Men's \"Counter Spell\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1144447-blood_ceremony_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1144447-blood_ceremony_1.jpg 1022w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/55780/1144447-blood_ceremony_1.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1144447-blood_ceremony_1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The X-Men's \"></noscript></a><figcaption>The X-Men's \"Counter Spell\"</figcaption></figure>towards the N'Garai invasion of the planet. She reminds them that they have defeated the demons before, and that they must not give up hope. Nightcrawler tells Kitty that there might be a way to stop the monsters, and the X-Men retreat to the safety of the Danger Room. Nightcrawler tells the X-Men that a magic spell was responsible for opening the N'Garai cairns, and that there existed a counter spell to close them. Kitty seemed wary that a devout priest would recommend a blood spell to stop the N'Garai, and Nightcrawler reminds his friend that both his foster mother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23007\" href=\"/margali-szardos/4005-23007/\" slug=\"margali-szardos\">Margali Szardos</a> and his former lover <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10970\" href=\"/amanda-sefton/4005-10970/\" slug=\"amanda-sefton\">Amanda Sefton</a> are both sorceresses. He adds that if they did not act quickly, the world would be consumed by the demons. Kitty tells the X-Men that she thought the demonic race known as the Rutai had overthrown the N'Garai, and her friends appear to take personal umbrage with the statement. They tell her that the <i>Rutai are nothing</i>, and the<i> N'Garai are all</i>. Kitty asks what they must do next, and Nightcrawler tells her that they must draw a pentagram on the floor of the Danger Room. After doing so, he tells Kitty to stand in the center of the pentagram. He explains that an innocent soul is required in order for the counter spell to work. He produces a goblet and a dagger, Kitty pricks her finger with it, and lets a droplet of blood drip into the goblet. Nightcrawler says that all of the X-Men must place of droplet of their blood into the goblet, and each one does so obligingly before the goblet is returned to Kitty. <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1144450\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5267175572519\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1144450\"><img alt=\"Magik?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg 1048w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Magik?\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg 1048w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1144450-magik_never_dies.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Magik?</figcaption></figure>Kitty drinks from the goblet, and is consumed in eldritch flame. The flame shoots out of the young mutant and engulfs her teammates. Their disguises are burned away, revealing five N'Garai demons where her friends once stood. Even worse, the spirits of her friends appear in petrified visages of the N'Garai demons that have possessed their bodies. Terrified, Kitty drops the goblet, and Belasco rises from the blood. The Danger Room dissapears, and Kitty realizes that she has been in hellish pocket dimension of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\" href=\"/limbo/4020-42990/\" slug=\"limbo\">Limbo </a>the entire time. Belasco advances on Kitty, and tells her that when she initially escaped his realm in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3092\" href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men/4050-3092/\" slug=\"the-uncanny-x-men\">Uncanny X-Men # 160</a> , she became an unwitting pawn in his plot to conjure five Bloodstones from the souls of the X-Men. He tells her that a catalyst stone is required for the spell to work, and that once upon the time, that honor was held by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\" href=\"/illyana-rasputin/4005-8303/\" slug=\"illyana-rasputin\">Illyana Rasputin</a>, before she succumbed to the Legacy Virus. Belasco plunges his hand into Kitty's chest, and pulls her soul out of her body in the form of the catalyst stone needed for his spell. Kitty falls to the ground, motionless, and Belasco tells Kitty that once he is done with her, damnation will seem like <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42470\" href=\"/heaven/4020-42470/\" slug=\"heaven\">Heaven</a>. Suddenly, an armor-clad young woman proclaiming herself as<a data-ref-id=\"4005-10970\" href=\"/amanda-sefton/4005-10970/\" slug=\"amanda-sefton\"> Magik</a> appears before Belasco and Kitty through a stepping disc, wielding the<a data-ref-id=\"4055-42991\" href=\"/soulsword/4055-42991/\" slug=\"soulsword\"> Soulsword</a>. Kitty is stunned, and wonders aloud if it is indeed her best friend Illyana, seemingly back from the dead. The enigmatic new Magik advances on Belasco with the Soulsword, and Belasco manages to best her in combat. Before he can deliver a killing blow, Kitty attacks the sorcerer from behind with a bone claw of Wolverine's that she utilized as a weapon. Her attack forces Belasco to retreat, but he encourages the young women to confront him again soon, should they live to see the opportunity. He then disappears, leaving them to momentarily collect themselves.   <br/> <br/>Magik is perplexed by how it is possible for Kitty to stand without her soul, and when Kitty refers to her again as Illyana, the sorceress asks her to call her by her code name. Kitty asks if there was ever a N'Garai cairn in Limbo before, and Magik tells her that she didn't believe so. When Magik asks her what she meant by her statement, Kitty tells her<i> something bad</i>. the N'Garai used the cairns to transport themselves between different dimensions, and Kitty realized that the demons intended to use them to conquer the earth. Another N'Garai demon attacked the young women, and Magik killed the monster with the Soulsword. Kitty asked how it was possible that Illyana was there, and Magik replied that they would concern themselves with that, later. The sorceress expressed concerned for Kitty having just had her soul torn from her body, but the young mutant assured her that she felt fine, all things considered.  Magik apologizes for not finding Kitty sooner, and the young woman asks how Belasco was able to teleport her to Limbo without her knowledge, and why he refers to her as \"Catspaw\". Magik explains that it began during her first encounter with the sorcerer. When Belasco removed Kitty's skeleton from her body, and encased her body inside of an eldritch crystal, he failed to inform her that the crystal was etched with a Spell of Dominion, and bonded to Kitty when her skeleton was returned to her body. It was this spell that was responsible for sending Kitty to Limbo. Kitty is infuriated that she became an unwitting pawn of Belasco's, once again.",

The Legion of Superheroes is trying to save civilians from disappearing into nothingness: the future is disappearing, and according to Brainiac 5, it's all because of his ancestor, Brainiac 1. Brainiac 5 has established that his ancestor had killed Superman, which has resulted in the capture of all bottled cities. Since all the planets of the 31st century are originary from those bottled cities, and the cities were never released, then the planets never could have existed. As Brainiac borrows energy from fellow legionnaires, he disappears back to the present promising to see them again and saying: \"Long Live the Legion\".</p><h2>The Present</h2><p>In the present, Brainiac has started to invade New Krypton. As the Legion of Superheroes' Espionnage Squad recruit Mon-El and Superboy to help them save the bottled cities, Supergirl and Alura battle on New Krypton.</p><p>Once they are all reunited, General Zod asks Supergirl and Mon-El to leave before orderring his troops to arrest the Legion.</p><p>Alura comes in to prevent them from escaping, and fights Superboy. Supergirl arrives and sees her \"cousin\" hurting her mother. As they tell her Zod orderred their arrest, Supergirl explains to Alura the Legion is a Superhero team.</p><p>Alura goes and meets General Zod for more informition on his battle technique while the Legion attacks Brainiac's ship to free the bottled cities.</p><p>Thanks to Brainiac 5, they manage to breach the security field.

Outside, New Krypton is invaded and Kandor is turned into another bottled city.</p><p>As Superman tries to save Kandor, he is hit with a blast of red sunlight, and falls in the middle of the sky.</p><p>It is then revealed that Brainiac 1 worked alongside Lex Luthor and General Zod to destroy New Krypton...</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-247138\" href=\"/superman-last-stand-of-new-krypton-volume-one/4000-247138/\" slug=\"superman-last-stand-of-new-krypton-volume-one\">Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton Volume 1</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-260837\" href=\"/superman-last-stand-of-new-krypton-volume-two/4000-260837/\" slug=\"superman-last-stand-of-new-krypton-volume-two\">Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton Volume 2</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-296584\" href=\"/superman-sonderband-/4000-296584/\" slug=\"superman-sonderband-\">Superman Sonderband #45</a></li></ul>",
