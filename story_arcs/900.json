    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a> experiences overwhelming feelings of guilt and regret after killing three <a data-ref-id=\"4060-52655\" href=\"/phantom-zone-inhabitants/4060-52655/\" slug=\"phantom-zone-inhabitants\">Kryptonian criminals</a>.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, Superman leaves Earth and travels through space where he hopes he can find a place where he might never harm anyone again.</p><p>During his self-imposed exile, Superman meets new alien races, including a slave-based empire and its leader <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12162\" href=\"/mongul/4005-12162/\" slug=\"mongul\">Mongul</a> who imprisons Superman. As Superman fights for his life in the gladiatorial games, he comes in contact with an old priest who had spent time on Krypton long before it was destroyed. Superman learns more about his planet's past and, in the process, decides that its time to return to Earth.</p><h2>Preceding Events</h2><p>It’s not easy being Metropolis’ hero, but Superman never faced any threat that made him reevaluate his role until he was asked – by the US president no less – to investigate disappearances in the town of Trudeau. In Tradeau Superman discovers <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59422\" href=\"/hfuhruhurr/4005-59422/\" slug=\"hfuhruhurr\">Hfuhruhurr</a> the Word Bringer, who is collecting sentient brains and minds to further his own power. After defeating Hfuhruhurr, the imprisoned minds somehow use Superman’s own body to kill themselves (see <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-3777\" href=\"/adventures-of-superman-annual/4050-3777/\" slug=\"adventures-of-superman-annual\">The Adventures of Superman Annual</a> #1</i>).</p><p>Another difficult task follows later when Superman is called upon to challenge the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25998\" href=\"/time-trapper/4005-25998/\" slug=\"time-trapper\">Time Trapper</a>. In the aftermath of this event, and on an alternative Earth created by the Time Traveller three Kryptonian prisoners escape. Superman eventually subdues the criminals, but they've already destroyed all the inhabitants of the parallel Earth. Overwhelmed by their crime, and unwilling to leave them with any possibility of repeating their crimes, Superman kills all three Kryptonians (see <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-3816\" href=\"/superman/4050-3816/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a> #22</i>).</p><p>The realization that he’s killed in haste leaves Superman in a state of self-doubt that only gets worse with time. His encounters with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4684\" href=\"/brainiac/4005-4684/\" slug=\"brainiac\">Brainiac</a> – who tries to explore the dark recesses of Superman’s mind – exacerbates the problem (see <i>Superman</i> #25). Superman, and his alter-ego Clark Kent, finds himself continually bedraggled. His tiredness however has a specific cause which Superman discovers, to his dismay: in his sleep Superman is adopting the persona of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13690\" href=\"/gangbuster/4005-13690/\" slug=\"gangbuster\">Gangbuster</a>, and under that guise expressing the violent and vigilante tendencies he never could otherwise (see <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-3778\" href=\"/adventures-of-superman/4050-3778/\" slug=\"adventures-of-superman\">The Adventures of Superman</a> #450</i>).</p><p>Realizing that his mental state is only getting worse, and that soon he might harm those around him, Superman decides to leave Earth immediately. He has no specific destination in mind.</p><h2>Main Story</h2><p>For a long time Superman discovers nothing in space – just dead planets and strange aliens. He even discovers a planet that maybe, just maybe, could serve as his new home, but here too fate conspires against rest and Superman moves on.</p><p>A series of chance events lead Superman to a gut wrenchingly familiar sight: an empty world. It’s just like Tradeau, and that means that Hfuhruhurr is somewhere, still stealing minds for his sick cosmic power play. Superman now has a purpose in space, to hunt this monster down.</p><p>When Superman does discover Hfuhruhurr he finds that he’s become more powerful than ever; endless arrays of brains in vats fill the enormous space craft. After a long battle against Hfuhruhurr and his proxy powers the minds that make up Hfuhruhurr’s Union turn against him. In the aftermath of the battle the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55883\" href=\"/infinity-union/4055-55883/\" slug=\"infinity-union\">Union</a> minds tell Superman that on Earth he was not taken control of and used to kill the prisoner brains. Instead, the imprisoned Union minds on Earth, in Tradeau, merely subdued Superman and then used their own power to turn the power off to their machines.</p><p>In other words Superman committed no crimes at Tradeau. And with that knowledge, the burden Superman has been carrying on his shoulders lightens, if only just a bit.</p><p>But even that’s not enough, and Superman continues to lose control of his mind – he is haunted by vivid dreams of those Kryptonians he killed. This loss of focus and weakening as he his air slowly runs out leaves Superman vulnerable, and he is soon captured by minions of the warlord emperor Mongul.</p><p>Mongul forces Superman to fight in his gladiatorial games. The fights have been designed to end in death, but Superman refuses to kill, especially not after all that’s happened to him recently. Instead Superman subdues foe after foe, including the warrior <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27749\" href=\"/draaga/4005-27749/\" slug=\"draaga\">Draaga</a>, without killing any of them, and thus infuriates Mongul.</p><p>However, while Superman has been captive, one of Mongul’s prison guards recognizes Superman as a Kryptonian and seeks the advice of another: the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27019\" href=\"/cleric/4005-27019/\" slug=\"cleric\">Cleric</a>. The Cleric telepathically communicates with Superman, telling Superman about Krypton’s history. And when Superman is finally captured by Mongul, the Cleric awakens him, and emboldens Superman to free himself. Once again Mongul’s rule has been challenged by Superman, but this time his people begin to run amok, and <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56267\" href=\"/warworld/4020-56267/\" slug=\"warworld\">Warworld</a> devolves into chaos.</p><p>When Superman finally joins up with the Cleric he is given an artifact the Cleric has been holding onto – an old, very old, relic from Krypton: the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5377\" href=\"/eradicator/4005-5377/\" slug=\"eradicator\">Eradicator</a>. The Eradicator seems capable of great power, and it is possible that it can teach Superman more about the world of his parents. But more importantly, right now, is the Eradicator’s potential to help Superman overcome his feelings of deep guilt. Through the Eradicator Superman gains a new perspective on his killing of the Kryptonian criminals. Superman still sees it as an act that will burden him, but he also sees that his destiny demands that he renew his mission.</p><p>Superman leaves, taking the Eradicator with him. The Cleric is dead, and before departing Superman builds a monument to him; a monument to great guilt and great destiny.</p><h2>Aftermath</h2><p>Superman returns home refreshed, but time hasn’t stopped in his absence and some things have changed in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\" href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" slug=\"metropolis\">Metropolis</a>. On his return Superman must deal with the continued presence of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13690\" href=\"/gangbuster/4005-13690/\" slug=\"gangbuster\">Gangbuster</a>, as well as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22640\" href=\"/matrix/4005-22640/\" slug=\"matrix\">Matrix</a>’s impersonation of Clark Kent.</p><p>In addition to all that’s transpired in Metropolis, Superman must also deal with what’s changed in his outlook – his dedication to justice <i>and</i> life is reinforced – as well as what Superman’s brought back from space; this includes the Eradicator artifact (see the story arc <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56002\" href=\"/the-day-of-the-krypton-man/4045-56002/\" slug=\"the-day-of-the-krypton-man\">The Day of the Krypton Man</a>)</p><h3>Effect on Superman mythology</h3><p>The <i>Superman: Exile</i> story arc doesn’t substantially change anything about the Superman character. It <i>does</i> however highlight certain streaks in his personality which is important for understanding the post-<a data-ref-id=\"4040-1770\" href=\"/john-byrne/4040-1770/\" slug=\"john-byrne\">Byrne</a> Superman mythos. In this modern Superman mythology, the hero is capable of extreme doubt, but is dedicated to his mission for reasons of which he is self-aware: Superman’s mission is an obligation, akin to destiny.</p><p>Aside from revealing more of Superman’s personality, the story arc reveals a lot about his Kryptonian history. Readers learn that 200,000 years ago Kryptonians clashed against the religious ideals of a man called the Cleric who spoke out against cloning. Readers learn about the war that occurred then, and that even then there was a genetic abnormality which prevented Kryptonians from leaving their planet alive. This supports Bryne’s Superman mythology, in which Krypton is assuredly <i>not</i> a paradise lost, but rather a restrictive society full of internal problems.</p><h2>Collected Edition</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-44806\" href=\"/superman-exile/4050-44806/\" slug=\"superman-exile\">Superman: Exile</a></li></ul>",

Out of nowhere his yellow power ring goes berserk and experiences a massive energy surge that brings visions to Gardner's conscience. Visions of very vivid and terrible events begin to overcome his mind. He sees <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\" href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" slug=\"hal-jordan\">Hal Jordan</a> strangling <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10448\" href=\"/sinestro/4005-10448/\" slug=\"sinestro\">Sinestro</a> in one particular hallucination. In another, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6952\" href=\"/kilowog/4005-6952/\" slug=\"kilowog\">Kilowog</a> seems to have been murdered and is lying dead upon <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">Oa</a>. Then guy sees Jordan bedecked in a strange looking armor, unaware of the latter's recent possession by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\" href=\"/parallax/4005-41293/\" slug=\"parallax\">Parallax</a>. Gardner is under the impression that what he saw was nothing more than a nightmare, ignorant of the recent events of the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-41289\" href=\"/emerald-twilight/4045-41289/\" slug=\"emerald-twilight\">Emerald Twilight</a>.</p><p>Gardner's <a data-ref-id=\"4060-39355\" href=\"/qwardians/4060-39355/\" slug=\"qwardians\">Qwardian</a> ring shorts out as a result of the energized vision and thus he's forced to look for alternative means of making a difference as a superhero. He grudgingly seeks the expertise of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2054\" href=\"/blue-beetle-kord/4005-2054/\" slug=\"blue-beetle-kord\">Ted Kord</a>, who fashions Gardner a power suit to compensate for his lack of ring-based power as of late. Though the new suit does raise Gardner's spirits somewhat, still plenty of hard feelings are left over. After all, in addition to the different power changes he's experienced, Gardner's also wondering where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2051\" href=\"/ice/4005-2051/\" slug=\"ice\">Tora</a> is and has the distinct impression that she's trying to avoid him. His suspicions are confirmed when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" slug=\"wonder-woman\">Diana</a> tells Gardner that the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">League</a> has known of Tora's whereabouts for some time but counsels Gardner to exercise restraint by adding that she was going through changes of her own and needed time to straighten things out.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1750005-guygardner1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1750005\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4061207609595\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1750005-guygardner1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1750005\"><img alt=\"Militia's rage\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1750005-guygardner1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1750005-guygardner1.jpg 1209w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1750005-guygardner1.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1750005-guygardner1.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1750005-guygardner1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Militia's rage</figcaption></figure><p>As Gardner is adjusting to his new battle suit, other events are taking place. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2053\" href=\"/militia/4005-2053/\" slug=\"militia\">Militia</a> as of late is enraged that the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58221\" href=\"/quorum/4060-58221/\" slug=\"quorum\">Quorum</a> isn't letting him have another shot at beating Gardner down, though they assure him that his chance will come in due time. Bad blood has been brewing between Gardner and Militia for some time due to prior conflicts. In addition, an interstellar ship is plummeting toward Earth harboring an unnamed member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\" href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" slug=\"green-lantern-corps\">Green Lantern Corps</a> in circumstances not unlike <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22634\" href=\"/abin-sur/4005-22634/\" slug=\"abin-sur\">Abin Sur's</a> crash landing. Before his ship is destroyed upon orbital entry, however, he comments on the recent mission of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46405\" href=\"/graf-toren/4005-46405/\" slug=\"graf-toren\">Graf Toren</a> and other Green Lanterns in their attempt to stop Jordan and expresses concern for the others that had gone missing in that venture.</p><p>Taking Diana's words into account, Gardner goes to the Arctic Circle to seek out Tora and talk with her. Sadly for him, it turns into a war of words between the two estranged lovers. Tora tells him that he is still the same insensitive jerk she had always known while Gardner begs to differ on the matter, claiming that recent events in his life have made him do some serious soul-searching. Just before she can start to accept the fact that maybe Guy has changed, the reunion is quickly disrupted by Militia's arrival, having been jettisoned from a Quorum submarine that had tracked Gardner to the position in the Arctic he had gone.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1749997\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4166666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1749997\"><img alt=\"Militia vs. Gardner\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg 1200w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Militia vs. Gardner\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg 1200w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749997-guygardner6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Militia vs. Gardner</figcaption></figure><p>Militia and Gardner engage one another on the arctic ice shelf in a seesaw battle that goes back and forth between the two, both using their respective power armor in the fight. After gaining the upper hand in the fight, Militia finds himself facing another threat as Tora hoists him effortlessly away from Gardner, a clear allusion to the super strength Tora had recently gained. Militia adapts to this handicap by having the Quorum increase the power of his battle suit so that the two can fight on equal terms. Gardner gets back into the fight just to find that Militia is really his older brother Mace. Eventually his Qwardian ring becomes reactivated, giving him the needed edge to put down Mace for good and win the fight, though he is quick to note that the ring had never had such energy flowing through it prior to this strange impulse.</p><p>Hoping to relax after the fight, Gardner and Tora are interrupted once more by an uninvited character. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12663\" href=\"/alan-scott/4005-12663/\" slug=\"alan-scott\">Alan Scott</a> comes to tell Guy that he must come with him immediately since a great danger besieges the universe. He mentions to Gardner the intricate connections between all the recent events dealing with the Green Lantern Corps, Gardner's own experiences and even those relating to Jordan. Recent events like the power surge in the Qwardian ring and the visions that had come as a result of that surge. Also of utmost importance was the recent disappearance of Jordan and other Green Lanterns from Oa and the appearance of a green dome over the area where Coast City once stood. Scott explains these connections and advises that they must be investigated. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25279\" href=\"/darkstar/4005-25279/\" slug=\"darkstar\">Darkstar</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4608\" href=\"/ferrin-colos/4005-4608/\" slug=\"ferrin-colos\">Ferrin Colos</a> reaffirms Scott's story with reports of Green Lanterns missing in action across the cosmos. Guy agrees that something must be done and that he must go to Oa to ascertain the truth of what happened to these missing Lanterns. Fortunately for him he would have the aid of Scott, Colos and several select members of the Justice League to assist in this investigation.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1749991\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.398676592225\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1749991\"><img alt=\"Kilowog's skull\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg 1209w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kilowog's skull\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg 1209w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749991-guygardner10.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kilowog's skull</figcaption></figure><p>Gardner's team consisted of himself, Scott, Colos, Diana, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\" href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" slug=\"martian-manhunter\">J'onn J'onzz</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2050\" href=\"/captain-atom/4005-2050/\" slug=\"captain-atom\">Nathaniel Adam</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2049\" href=\"/the-ray-ray-terrill/4005-2049/\" slug=\"the-ray-ray-terrill\">Ray Terrill</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2046\" href=\"/arisia/4005-2046/\" slug=\"arisia\">Arisia</a>. Together they headed off to uncover the mystery of the missing Lanterns. En route to Oa they ran into what seemed to be an asteroid field, prompting Gardner, Scott and Colos to go searching. They found out quickly that the debris in the vacuum were not asteroids but instead bodies of dead Green Lanterns, among them Toren and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46423\" href=\"/chaselon/4005-46423/\" slug=\"chaselon\">Chaselon</a>. In a nearby space funeral pyre, the three happen to come across an extraterrestrial by the name of Probert, a former Lantern, wrapping up the dead in ceremonial cloth. Probert reveals to them that the culprit behind the mass murders was Jordan himself and that he was still upon Oa. Gardner and the others then proceed to land on the charred planet, finding nothing but death and decay. He is the first to discover the skeletal remains of Kilowog during the impending search, leading to a serious drop in morale among the team members. Shortly thereafter, Jordan comes out of nowhere to savagely attack Gardner and his teammates.</p><p>Everyone on Gardner's team is summarily defeated in due course by Jordan. None of them prove a match for his newfound entity-based powers. Green adversarial constructs easily subdue Diana while cosmic blasts knock out Arisia. Emerald flames burn into J'onn's flesh while dark green slime surrounds and consumes Ray, nullifying his light based power. Jordan's energies coat Adams's body, rendering him helpless while Darkstar is quickly overcome in the engagement. Even Scott's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-47348\" href=\"/starheart/4055-47348/\" slug=\"starheart\">Starheart</a>-based ring is unable to even the odds and Jordan ends up capturing every one of Gardner's teammates, imprisoning them in emerald stasis fields.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1749990\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3716666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1749990\"><img alt=\"Jordan victorious\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg 1200w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jordan victorious\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg 1200w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1749990-guygardner11.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jordan victorious</figcaption></figure><p>All seems lost for Gardner's team-up adventure until he attacks Jordan himself using a combination of his Qwardian ring and battle suit. His furious attacks only stun Jordan initially before the latter gained the upper hand by breaking Gardner's yellow ring, rendering him powerless once more. Gardner is then struck with such lethal force by Jordan that he crashes into Oa, upon which his battle suit is shattered beyond all hope of repair. Jordan then absorbs the remaining yellow energy and traps Gardner into a stasis field like his comrades. Hal Jordan has gained satisfaction then knowing that nobody will stand in his way of righting the wrongs of the past, however wrong his methods might be.

Starman and Gangbuster try to keep the streets safe in Superman's absence, while Hamilton builds a power suit for Superman to use in the interim.</p><p>Starman eventually determines that Luthor is responsible for Superman's loss of power, although strangely Hamilton can't detect any radiation in the Red Kyptonite Starman brings back.</p><p>It is only by tricking Luthor into revealing his source, namely Mxyzptlk, that Superman regains his powers and Mxyzptlk is once again banished to the fifth <a href=\"/5th-dimensional-imp/4015-55734/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55734\">dimension</a>.</p><h2>Preceding Events</h2><p>Mxyzptlk first met Luthor when Superman was in space (see <i><a href=\"/superman-exile/4045-56377/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56377\">Superman: Exile</a></i>) at which Luthor inadvertently teaches the imp to lie (see <a href=\"/superman-as-good-as-his-word-poison-pill/4000-31191/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-31191\"><i>Superman</i> #31</a>).</p><p>Mxyzptlk first gets the idea for playing around with Kryptonite during the race he enforces between Superman and <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a> (<a href=\"/adventures-of-superman-speed-kills/4000-32375/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-32375\"><i>Adventures of Superman </i>#463</a>). At this time, Mxyzptlk spots Luthor's crew seeking <a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite</a>, and offers Red Kryptonite which is rejected.</p><p>Soon after Mxyzptlk disappears, Superman deals with a Kryptonian artifact called the <a href=\"/eradicator/4005-5377/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5377\">Eradicator</a>, which transforms his personality. Superman becomes more Kryptonian, and the identity of Clark Kent begins to be lost as he starts self-identifying as Kal-L. In the aftermath of these events, Clark realises that he values his humanity and begins a romantic relationship with <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a> (see <i><a href=\"/the-day-of-the-krypton-man/4045-56002/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56002\">The Day of the Krypton Man</a></i>).</p><h2>Main Story</h2><p>Superman is in the midst of carrying off a criminal when he loses his powers. One second he's flying, the next he's dropping into the Metropolis harbour waters powerless. Superman couldn't know it, but Luthor is behind what's happening to him. Luthor is playing a pawn in another of Mxyzptlk's game. The deal is that Luthor can have a rock of Red Kryptonite which will take away Superman's abilities as long as he never reveals to Superman where it is he got the Red Kryptonite from.</p><p>This is a deal Luthor's more than happy to make. He's been waiting years to make Superman suffer, to make up for all the humiliation he's caused him. Superman <i>does</i> suspect Luthor, and goes looking for him. Finally, Luthor thinks, the time has come to humiliate Superman. Luthor beats up the man of steel before having him cast out of Lexcorp.</p><p>Without his powers it is harder than ever for Superman to follow up on his mysterious loss of powers. And if that weren't bad enough, Superman must do everything he can to keep the news of his limitations off the street; Metropolis' criminals would riot if they knew how vulnerable the city suddenly was.</p><p>The first idea Superman has is to enlist the help of Starman, using the latter's solar rays to recharge Superman's powers. Unfortunately not only does the plan not work, but Superman is all them more battered for trying. Starman continues to help Superman, first by impersonating him in Metropolis, thus quashing rumours, and secondly by seeking out Luthor who everyone agrees must <i>somehow</i> be involved.</p><p>Luthor is shocked to see Superman flying - although of course it's actually Starman in disguise - and Starman snatches the Red Kryptonite away from the billionaire to be taken back to Hamilton's lab for study.</p><p>Unlike the Green Kryptonite with which Superman is unfortunately all too well familiar, this Red Kryptonite doesn't seem to be emitting any radiation. But if it's not emitting any radiation then how could it possibly be affecting Superman so strongly? The nonsensical nature of it all is the final clue: Superman, of course, is vulnerable to magic and it must be the case that somehow magic is involved in this too.</p><p>Once again Superman visits Lexcorp, hoping for answers, but this time he wears the guise of Clark Kent. What's more, he comes bearing gifts: the Red Kryptonite. The deal is that if Luthor will give him an interview then Clark will return the Red Kryptonite he's chanced upon. Luthor of course agrees, but doesn't realise that in revealing to Kent the source of the crimson rock that he's negating the terms of his agreement with Mxyzptlk.</p><p>Once again Mxyzptlk loses in his own game while Superman regains his powers.</p><p>Superman may have regained his powers, but he's still living the double life of Clark Kent, and Kent's starting to fall for Lois. Maybe it's his recent brush with the inhumanity of Krypton, and maybe it's the sudden vulnerability he's been exposed to, in any case, Clark decides that it's time: Clark proposes to Lois!</p><h2>Aftermath </h2><p>The most significant aftermath of this story regards the blossoming relationship of Clark and Lois. The last issue of this arc ends with Kent's proposal being accepted, and is directly followed up in <a href=\"/adventures-of-superman-rings-of-fire/4000-33484/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-33484\"><i>Adventures of Superman </i>#473</a> as they share the news with all their friends.</p><p>The after-effects of the proposal have ramifications all the way down to the <i>Wedding and Beyond</i> storyline, and well past that.</p><h3>Effect on Superman mythology </h3><p>Although Red Kryptonite made a frequent appearance in <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\">silver age</a> Superman stories, this is it's first appearance in the post-<a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis</a> timeline. In this timeline, it was decided that there should only be - at least in the main - Green Kryptonite, and that it should not be too plentiful.</p><p>The Red Kryptonite as it appears in this storyline is uniquely different from it's pre-Crisis analogue. Red Kryptonite here is a product of Mxyzptlk and it's actions depend directly on that imp's magic. By comparison, in the pre-Crisis timeline the Red Kryptonite was a product of Green Kryptonite and hence could be found on Earth.</p>",

Frank - equipped with a powersuit looking like Captain America's uniform - is tasked to stop the Ghost Rider. The Ultimate Universe's Spirit of Vengeance is killing his way through philantropists and other seemingly innocent people. When facing off against the Avengers, Ghost Rider is scared off by a cross on The Punisher's chest. It is revealed that Johnny Blaze - the man now known as the Ghost Rider - is powered by Damian Hellstrom and has traded his soul to get a safe life for his beloved and a chance of revenge. His ultimate target: Blackthorne, now an important man in the White House. When Blaze reaches the White House, Hellstrom transforms Blackthorne into a redclad version of the Ghost Rider and the two face off. The Punisher manages to mortally wound Blackthorne and then go to do the hit that Nick Fury has kept him from doing in the beginning on the story.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/ultimate-comics-avengers-crime-and-punishment-ultimate-comics-avengers-crime-and-punishment/4000-240131/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-240131\">Ultimate Comics Avengers: Crime and Punishment</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ultimate-comics-vengadores-4/4000-298049/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-298049\">Ultimate Comics Vengadores #4</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ultimate-comics-vengadores-5/4000-298050/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-298050\">Ultimate Comics Vengadores #5</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ultimate-comics-vengadores-6/4000-298051/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-298051\">Ultimate Comics Vengadores #6</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

in flames screaming and begging for them to put him out of his misery.   The agonized man fortunately gets his wish much to the sad conclusion of the officers present. </p><p><a

victims deserved what had come to them and has no intentions of stopping his killing spree any time soon.   With Batman attempting to stop the chain of murders, Grotesk blasts fire at an incoming vehicle as it passes down the street, forcing Bruce to save the innocent victims from a terrible fate while allowing his adversary to escape.   In the aftermath of all the commotion, Doctors Stavrides and Franklin come out from the clinic to assist in any way that they can, and Batman tells the latter that Perun and his men came for her due to money her brother owed them.   With a straight face she tells the Caped Crusader that her brother  had been dead for two months and that she knew nothing of such a deal.  <p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\"

the Wayne Foundation was funding a device that he had been working on, the I-Gore.   During the course of the conversation, Ms. Tremayne was so impressed with ’s work that she ill-advisedly referred to him as Mr. Wayne’s racial equal, causing him to ponder why Bruce should not be referred to as his “pale” alternate.   Bruce is quick to back himself out of the conversation after the awkward turn it came to and comes across ’s sister Amina, who is quick to apologize for her brother’s snide remarks.  Later on she agrees to join him from which a brief romance developed.  Thereafter a clear picture of motive begins to be laid out in front of Bruce in order to establish a potential identity for Grotesk.    In remembrance of that even, he is then compelled to believe that Wayne Franklin is not dead, but is instead the Grotesk killer.  <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1777476-grotesk20.jpg\"

urgency to catch the Grotesk killer was all the greater now due to the deaths of the security guards in the main lobby, all of whom were ex-cops.   In turn Batman tells Gordon what he has learned about Grotesk and the strange connections to the I-Gore and Wayne Franklin and the first victim, suggesting that the police department get a warrant to have the grave sight exhumed for DNA analysis.   Gordon counters with newly found evidence that the ’s parents were involved with a radically militant group during the 1960s, a group whose membership included Grotesks’s second victim, Georg Williamson.   Apparently the group raided and robbed banks during that time before its members, including Williamson, went into hiding.   Gordon then reports Williamson was being blackmailed by someone, which ties in to ’s borrowing of money from the Yakuza and Russian mob in order to finance his I-Gore technology.   He apparently borrowed money from so many sources and had no intention of paying back the money he had been given, and therefore staged his own death in order to escape his debts.   Bruce decides to seek out Amina to find out what else she knows.</p><figure

her brother’s but a medical patient by the name of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-77441\" href=\"/henry-jones/4005-77441/\" slug=\"henry-jones\">Henry Jones</a>.   She tells him that  created the I-Gore because he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and could not continue to do surgery effectively with his trembling hands and found funding for the project from the black market, namely the dirty bill folds of Perun and Johnny Karaoke.   The problem with his choice of creditors in the form of the Russian and Japanese mafia wanted quick results or repayment of what they loaned out.  Wayne felt he needed time to perfect his creation and was not readily willing to pay back what loan sharks like Donny Lucidc handed to him.  His plan took on a more insidious form thereafter.  </p><figure

he would not be responsible for repaying the money he had obtained and that she had helped him by finding Jones, who was also diagnosed with Parkinson’s.   By having Jones’ body discovered at the docks, it would then be assumed that  had been killed instead of a lonely derelict patient.    promised Jones not only a quick and painless death but a $50,000.00 monetary reimbursement for his mother.   He had made all the arrangements, even rigging a laboratory at the local  wharves to make it seem like an accident. Unfortunately his violent creditors learned early enough of ’s attempted skullduggery and countered his plan with a premature explosion that burned his body beyond repair.    ended up using the I-Gore to try and repair his body and reneged on his promise to Jones and his mother.  It could be assumed later on that Wayne as Grotesk murdered Jones before even targeting Tremayne.  </p><figure

What is clear is that the events of <i>Schism</i> will leave the X-Men divided. It is possible that the event could be the upcoming <i>Avengers vs. X-Men</i> crossover, slated to begin in April 2012.</p><p>Promotional material for <i>Schism</i> used the tag line, \"United No More\". On June 09, 2011 (before the first issue of <i>X-Men: Schism</i> had been released) Marvel had already announced that events from Schism would lead to the cancellation of Uncanny X-Men in October 2011, the flagship X-Men title. After a week of fan speculation, a press released in June 16, 2011 announced that Schism would be followed by <i>X-Men: ReGenesis</i>, a story arc that will see the launch of two new X-Men titles; <i>Uncanny X-Men</i> and <i>Wolverine And The X-Men</i>. Unlike the <i>Genesis</i> of 1991 which saw the launch of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-4605\" href=\"/x-men/4050-4605/\" slug=\"x-men\">X-Men</a>, the X-Men will not act as two separate yet united teams of <i>Gold</i> &amp; <i>Blue</i>. Instead each title will focus on two groups of X-Men operating in different terms &amp; paradigms to the other. The <i>Uncanny X-Men</i> title features a team consisting of Emma Frost, Cyclops, Danger, Magneto, Magik, and a Cytorrak enhanced Colossus. Meanwhile, Rogue, Gambit, Wolverine, Beast, Storm, and a host of other mutants star in <i>Wolverine and the X-Men</i>.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-308847\" href=\"/generation-hope-schism-generation-hope-schism/4000-308847/\" slug=\"generation-hope-schism-generation-hope-schism\">Generation Hope: Schism</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-293492\" href=\"/x-men-prelude-to-schism-x-men-prelude-to-schism/4000-293492/\" slug=\"x-men-prelude-to-schism-x-men-prelude-to-schism\">X-Men: Prelude to Schism</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-308862\" href=\"/x-men-schism-x-men-schism/4000-308862/\" slug=\"x-men-schism-x-men-schism\">X-Men: Schism</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-375885\" href=\"/marvel-icon-generation-hope-scisma/4000-375885/\" slug=\"marvel-icon-generation-hope-scisma\">Marvel Icon #8</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-375668\" href=\"/marvel-world-x-men-preludio-a-scisma/4000-375668/\" slug=\"marvel-world-x-men-preludio-a-scisma\">Marvel World #5</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-375712\" href=\"/marvel-world-/4000-375712/\" slug=\"marvel-world-\">Marvel World #6</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-375713\" href=\"/marvel-world-/4000-375713/\" slug=\"marvel-world-\">Marvel World #7</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-375714\" href=\"/marvel-world-/4000-375714/\" slug=\"marvel-world-\">Marvel World #8</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-343253\" href=\"/x-men-/4000-343253/\" slug=\"x-men-\">X-Men #15</a> (French)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-343254\" href=\"/x-men-/4000-343254/\" slug=\"x-men-\">X-Men #16</a> (French)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-370951\" href=\"/x-men-/4000-370951/\" slug=\"x-men-\">X-Men #131</a> (Brazil)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-372506\" href=\"/x-men-/4000-372506/\" slug=\"x-men-\">X-Men #132</a> (Brazil)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-331959\" href=\"/x-men-/4000-331959/\" slug=\"x-men-\">X-Men #137</a> (German)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-343206\" href=\"/x-men-/4000-343206/\" slug=\"x-men-\">X-Men #138</a> (German)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-343207\" href=\"/x-men-/4000-343207/\" slug=\"x-men-\">X-Men #139</a> (German)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-343393\" href=\"/x-men-extra-/4000-343393/\" slug=\"x-men-extra-\">X-Men Extra #90</a> (French)</li></ul>",

The ulterior motive is that Courtney wanted to check on Maxine’s well-being since the latter was recently de-powered in the aftermath of the battle against the Paradoran gods. Cyclone insists that she is fine and that the loss of her superpowers may actually be a blessing in disguise since it has allowed her to focus more upon her academic life at the university and put her concentration into connecting with new potential friends. Unfortunately Maxine is lying to Court, for not only is her school work suffering but she proceeds to eat alone at the campus food court.

He truly wishes to help her but Maxine seems intent on doing this herself. He comes to reveal that he knows she is Cyclone, and it is obviously no surprise from how almost everyone on campus seems to know her alter ego. When Tim attempts to ask her out upon a date, Maxine is quick to back out, still having feelings for Mon Roi, and heads back for her dorm room.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797170\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4441064638783\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797170\"><img alt=\"Another Cyclone?!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg 1315w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Another Cyclone?!\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg 1315w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797170-yon_3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Another Cyclone?!</figcaption></figure><p>Just as Maxine is ready to accept her fate living a powerless life, she receives a most shocking surprise when another Cyclone appears in her room.

Alas only Roxy is in communication to tell her that they left the planet for the Circinus Galaxy dealing with another problem entirely. Maxine and the Cyclone double try and figure out the problem for themselves by trying to find out who is the real one between the two of them. They try first by asking each other questions that only the true Maxine Hunkel would know. Unfortunately this inquisition goes nowhere and they are compelled then to think of a plethora of possibilities for why there are currently two of them present. Some of the possibilities range from multiversal theories to genetic mutations.

She even remembers battling the Paradoran gods just as Maxine does, but the only problem with this is the clone remembers the event as having just happened whereas in reality the adventure happened well over six weeks ago. The confusion concerning this discrepancy is short-lived when Tim is found flying over an intersection of summoning winds and cyclones in a fashion similar to her powers. And just when Maxine thinks it could not get any more confusing, a <i>third</i> Cyclone appears before them out of nowhere. The two Cyclones with powers attempt to try and bring Tim to a halt so that no more damage was done to the intersection, but he would have none of it, bursting free and heading south out of range. Unable to go after him, Maxine and the two Cyclone doubles head back for the dorm room to sort things out. When they arrive back at the dorm room, however, they are met by <i>nine</i> more Cyclone doubles.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797173\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.78101071975498\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797173\"><img alt=\"Roxy and Nine Cy-Clones\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg 1306w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Roxy and Nine Cy-Clones\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg 1306w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797173-yon_6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Roxy and Nine Cy-Clones</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, Maxine contacts Roxy in order to get to the bottom of this madness, and the latter is more than happy to explain once the analysis was clear. Apparently the nanites in Maxine’s blood sensed their demise after the damage she suffered at the hands of the Paradoran gods while she was in her sojourn at the hospital in and took on a response of rapid evolution. They soon spread from her body, seeking new hosts to multiply and colonize in. Maxine recalled having sneezed upon a nurse in the Turkish hospital and Roxy explains that that nurse was one of the first hosts for the nanites, from which she underwent a complete mutation to become Cyclone. From the nurse, the nanites spread to ten other bodies, choosing human hosts based solely on similarity to Maxine’s height and weight, and copied her DNA and brain processes while infusing them into their new hosts. This would account for why the Cyclone doubles all have the same memories and recollections that Maxine does and believe them to be the real Maxine. Strangely enough, the only thing that differed in the selected human hosts was bone structure. Roxy has bad news to announce though, reasoning that this strange occurrence cannot be mended without the original nanites, who were destroyed in the replication process. However, one Cyclone double points out that Tim is the one in possession of them with his newly gained powers.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797174\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5704441041348\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797174\"><img alt=\"Cy-Clones defeating Tim\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg 1306w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cy-Clones defeating Tim\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg 1306w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797174-yon_7.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cy-Clones defeating Tim</figcaption></figure><p>Maxine and the Cyclone doubles catch up to Tim, who is near the center of an Atlantic-based hurricane blowing over .

Working out a plan together, the Cyclone doubles throw their powerless friend into Tim’s arms in midst of them creating an icosahedron wind blast that compels the nanites to escape his biochemistry and return back to Maxine.

Tommy Bronson and Nathan Heywood seem willing to go while Karen Starr and Rick Tyler seem hesitant to trust this X-Anathraxian’s word. Not willing to stand about while the All-Stars deliberate, the alien visitor transports them to his planet immediately to bring them in the middle of a Jek D’Gronn invasion.</p><p>On X-Anathraxis, the All-Stars put up a stiff resistance against Jek D’Gronn attacks, but even seasoned ones like Albert Rothstein doubt they could hold off the attacks for long in waiting for the Qorathi fleet to finally arrive and relieve the beleaguered planet. But help does arrive when the fleet eventually comes, though it is found to be a ruse since the High magus of the Jek D’Gronn kidnapped the princess of Qorath and the fleet is merely acting on their Emperor’s orders to return his beloved daughter. Somehow the All-Stars seem to arrive upon Qorath IV and find themselves stranded looking for water and sustenance in midst of the sandy environment. Stargirl and Anna Fortune are quick to point out that while there is water to be had, there are also terrible sand worms to be dealt with. And these sand worms invariably come to attack the team during this search for water. The All-Stars are in dire straits.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797179\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.81445603576751\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797179\"><img alt=\"All-Stars in shock\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg 1342w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"All-Stars in shock\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg 1342w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797179-yon_12.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>All-Stars in shock</figcaption></figure><p>At the core of the X-Anathraxis, the battle rages on between the All-Stars and the Jek D’Gronn. But the Jek D'Gronn invasion eventually comes to a halt when its leaders are captured by Power Girl and the hostilities come to an end. The visitor thanks the All-Stars for their help and is most glad of the victory, though Power Girl is quick to point out that there was a heavy cost due to the fighting. The planet is saved from a most terrible fate and the All-Stars are transported back to Earth. Of course, when they arrive back at the headquarters, each one of them are confused to no end why they have found eleven different redheaded female individuals wearing costume similar to Cyclone’s. After all, they are no longer the \"Cy-Clones\" and appear to be just confused females who happen to be wearing the same costume arrangements that Maxine does as Cyclone.</p><h2>Aftermath</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797180\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.62996688741722\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797180\"><img alt=\"A tender moment\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg 1208w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A tender moment\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg 1208w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82159/1797180-yon_13.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A tender moment</figcaption></figure><p>Maxine finally has her powers back and has discovered ways of being her true superhero self while being able to balance her daily life and academic work. With some much needed time to spend with King Chimera, the two come to a clearer understanding of their feelings for each other. In addition, Roxy makes a curious discovery to Power Girl regarding Maxine’s bodily make up. Apparently the nanites made a little mistake when changing the cloning status, for Maxine’s bone structure was swiped with one of the other females in the process. Karen wonders if this would endanger Maxine’s health in any way, but Roxy quickly points out that she would not even know the difference lest she chose to count the fillings in her teeth. The story concludes with Roxy’s utter contempt for the bodies of humans.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-271835\" href=\"/jsa-all-stars-glory-days-glory-days/4000-271835/\" slug=\"jsa-all-stars-glory-days-glory-days\">JSA All-Stars: Glory Days</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><h3>Judge Dredd framed</h3><p>Shortly after his return form his <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56413\" href=\"/the-cursed-earth/4045-56413/\" slug=\"the-cursed-earth\">Cursed Earth</a> mission, Judge Dredd finds himself accused of the murder of a journalist. Judge Cal, the head of the powerful SJS (Special Judicial Squad) which policies the actions of the Judges themselves, is a member of the Council of Five and Deputy Chief Judge, second only to Chief Judge Goodman. In a meeting of the Council of Five, he urges the Judges to find Dredd guilty in light of the extraordinary evidence which shows Judge Dredd on video murdering the journalist. Unknown to Judge Dredd and the rest of the Council of Five, Judge Cal used a robot double to frame Judge Dredd and remove him from the city, with the aim of forcing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53935\" href=\"/chief-judge-goodman/4005-53935/\" slug=\"chief-judge-goodman\">Chief Judge Goodman</a> to resign due to his support of Judge Dredd. Judge Dredd receives the customary sentence for renegade judges- 20 years of penal servitude on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41103\" href=\"/titan/4020-41103/\" slug=\"titan\">Titan</a>. Knowing he is not guilty, Judge Dredd escapes from his prison transport to Titan and goes rogue in an attempt to clear his name.</p><p>Judge Dredd, having a suspicion that the crime was committed by a double, seeks out his informant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53955\" href=\"/max-normal/4005-53955/\" slug=\"max-normal\">Max Normal</a>. Max informs Dredd about an engineer who has been behind in debts and a possible subject to be blackmailed into making a robot duplicate. When Judge Dredd arrives at the engineer's house, he finds that he has already been killed. Attempting to find out who could have murdered him, Judge Dredd is met by his robot double who takes credit for the crime and proceeds to try and kill Judge Dredd. Judge Dredd returns back to the Grand Hall of Justice with the head of the robot double and is able to clear his name, but is no closer to discovering who could have framed him.</p><h3>The Rise of Chief Judge Cal</h3><p>With his plan to try and remove Goodman quietly foiled, Judge Cal steps up his plan. While Chief Judge Goodman is returning from a medical clinic for his age treatment, he is ambushed by unknown assassins who mortally wound him. Judge Dredd is the first on the scene where the dying Goodman passes him an insignia of the SJS he grabbed from one of the attackers. Judge Dredd deduces that only Judge Cal could be responsible for such an act having the most to gain from Judge Goodman's death and quickly rushes to apprehended him. As he leaves his home, Judge Dredd becomes the target of an SJS assassin and is grievously wounded, but he is found by his servant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53947\" href=\"/walter-the-wobot/4005-53947/\" slug=\"walter-the-wobot\">Walter the Wobot</a> who calls an ambulance to save him.</p><p>With Chief Judge Goodman dead, the line of succession allows Judge Cal to become Chief Judge. Judge Cal immediately shows his insanity by passing a whole array of strict and often ridiculous laws on the population of of Mega-City One, made worse by the fact that Mega-City One already had very repressive laws. Judge Cal also makes the extraordinary decision to reinstate the death penalty and makes it a possible punishment for almost anything. Judge Cal declares that the law has grown too \"soft\" and promises to restore order to the streets. Much to the surprise of the other Judges, Cal appoints his <a data-ref-id=\"4005-77724\" href=\"/judge-fish/4005-77724/\" slug=\"judge-fish\">pet goldfish</a> as his Deputy Chief Judge.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702312-the_verdict.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702312\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1786492374728\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702312-the_verdict.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702312\"><img alt=\"Judge Cal prepares to execute Judge Dredd\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702312-the_verdict.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702312-the_verdict.png 459w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px\" data-width=\"459\"></a><figcaption>Judge Cal prepares to execute Judge Dredd</figcaption></figure><p>Judge Cal orders the arrest of Judge Dredd after he is found to be alive and recovering from his wounds. He has his loyal Judges bring him to his chambers where he will render Judge Dredd's punishment. He passes the duty to Judge Fish, who he declares to have passed a sentence of death on Judge Dredd. Before he can do the deed, Judge Cal is interrupted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53960\" href=\"/judge-giant/4005-53960/\" slug=\"judge-giant\">Judge Giant</a>, who asks if he can have the duty of executing Judge Dredd. Giant reasons with Cal, telling him that he will only needlessly get his Chief Judge garb dirtied by Dredd's blood, and that he despises Dredd for what he did to him while he was finishing his cadet training under him. Judge Giant, once clear of Judge Cal, helps Dredd escape from his clutches and reach a safe-house where other Judges opposed to Judge Cal have gathered to make their move. Judge Dredd sees that many of them are wounded Judges or tutors at the Academy of Law, but knows that they must do something to resist against Cal.</p><h3>First insurrection against Judge Cal</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702253-insane.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702253\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.49177877428999\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702253-insane.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702253\"><img alt=\"Judge Cal passes more laws\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702253-insane.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702253-insane.png 669w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702253-insane.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Judge Cal passes more laws</figcaption></figure><p>Chief Judge Cal is enraged that Judge Dredd was able to escape with the help of Judge Giant. He passes even more laws out of rage, including making disobedience itself punishable by death, much to the confusion of his own Judges and the populace. Judge Cal is enraged when he finds that the people are protesting on the streets for his removal, demanding that the Judges quickly do away with any sign of dissent among the people.</p><p>Judge Dredd, witnessing the discontent among the people, sees a way for him and his Judges to resist against Cal. With his small team, Judge Dredd storms the broadcast center of Mega-City TV where he makes a plea for the citizens to march on the Grand Hall of Justice to try and stop Cal. The broadcast works and soon much of the city is on the march and are able to overwhelm the Judges, completely surrounding the Grand Hall of Justice. Judge Dredd, outside the hall, calls upon Judge Cal to surrender peacefully. Cal takes no notice of the scene and instead calls upon his ace in the hole- a whole fleet of brutal, flesh-eating <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59367\" href=\"/kleggs/4060-59367/\" slug=\"kleggs\">Klegg</a> mercenaries awaiting in the sky over the city. The Klegg reinforcements overwhelm the citizen mob and pushes Judge Dredd and his team back into hiding.</p><h3>\"I have decided to sentence the whole city to death\"</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702326-sentencing.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702326\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0732984293194\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702326-sentencing.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702326\"><img alt=\"Cal announces the city's punishment\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" data-width=\"382\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702326-sentencing.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702326-sentencing.png 382w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cal announces the city's punishment\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702326-sentencing.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702326-sentencing.png 382w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" data-width=\"382\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cal announces the city's punishment</figcaption></figure><p>Enraged that the citizens of the city rose up against him, Judge Cal announces that the whole city is to be executed. He lays out a plan by which everyone will be executed in alphabetical order, sector by sector, until the deed is done. The decision even outrages his closest advisers who begin to have doubts about Judge Cal's state of mind. One of these, Judge Cal's right hand man SJS Judge Slocum, is abducted by Judge Dredd's team. They convince Slocum to \"assassinate\" Deputy Chief Judge Fish, who later presents Judge Fish's dead body to a grief stricken Cal. As Dredd anticipated and much to the relief of everyone else, Cal takes Judge Fish's death as a sign that he should not proceed with the execution. Judge Cal decides to pardon the entire city and plans a lavish funeral for Judge Fish. Much to his anger however, no one actually shows up to the funeral.</p><p>Cal passes even more laws out of anger, and even appoints the head of the Klegg mercenaries, Grampus, as the new Deputy Chief Judge. Citizens begin trying to leave Mega-City One for the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56302\" href=\"/the-cursed-earth/4020-56302/\" slug=\"the-cursed-earth\">Cursed Earth</a>, but are prevented from doing so by Cal's forces. Judge Cal decides to construct a massive wall along the western border of Mega-City One, effectively imprisoning the citizens in their own city. After launching an attack on a part of the wall under construction, Judge Dredd is flushed out of his hidehout by Klegg mercenaries. A large force pursues Dredd and his allies in their small vehicle, including Cal who tries to kill him in his personal airship. One of Cal's attacks blasts a highway from under Dredd's vehicle, sending it careening down to the ground level of Mega-City One. The vehicle hits the ground with such force that it penetrates into the vast undercity, landing into the remnants of the Ohio River derogatorily referred to as the \"Big Stinky\".</p><h3>Fergee</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702355-fergee.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702355\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.69047619047619\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702355-fergee.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702355\"><img alt=\"Judge Dredd fights Fergee\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702355-fergee.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702355-fergee.png 630w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702355-fergee.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Judge Dredd fights Fergee\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702355-fergee.png\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702355-fergee.png 630w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702355-fergee.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Judge Dredd fights Fergee</figcaption></figure><p>Confident that no one could have survived such an impact, Judge Cal gloats over the death of Judge Dredd. Judge Cal later proceeds to prepare for the making of a movie glorifying his life, forcing the cooperation of a well-known actor to play his part while having a midget play his nemesis, Judge Dredd. Unknown to Cal however, Dredd was using a special vehicle with a reinforced command capsule, so while the rest of the vehicle was obliterated, the small cockpit containing Dredd and his allies protected them from death. Judge Dredd however notices that one of their number, Schmaltz, is wounded and nearing death. The judges encounter the devolved human denizens of the underground who attempt to kill them, but are chased away by Fergee, an erratic resident of the Big Stinky. Fergee then proceeds to get into a fight with Judge Dredd, batting him several times before Dredd lands an uppercut and sends him flying into the river. This earns Fergee's admiration who then befriends the judges.</p><p>After giving Judge Schmaltz a funeral by burning his body in the remains of the command capsule, Dredd and his team follow Fergee into a small settlement where he makes his home. Fergee declares that he is the \"King of the Big Smelly\" and welcomes them into his residence. Judge Dredd and his team then proceed to try and plan what they can do about Cal. Judge Dredd and his allies debate as to how Cal could have earned the loyalty of so many of the judges. Judge Giant suggests that Cal could have placed subliminal messages in the daily briefing tapes that every Judge is expected to attend. As Dredd was in the Cursed Earth in the weeks before Cal's rise to power and the tutors not expected to attend briefings, Judge Dredd sees this as a possibility. Dredd decides to return back to the surface, using the help of Fergee to find their way out of the cavernous undercity and sewers.</p><h3>Infiltration</h3><p>Once returning to the surface world, Judge Dredd returns to his apartment to find Kleggs have occupied it, making Walter their servant in the process. After defeating the Klegg, Dredd instructs Walter to call the Judges on them and try to earn Cal's trust. After being able to escape once again, Cal attempts to destroy Walter in a fit of rage but is prevented when Walter begins insulting Judge Dredd. Seeing this as an opportunity to smear his rival, Judge Cal has Walter spread stories to the major media of Mega-City One and declares him to be the first robot judge of the city.</p><p>Secretly, Walter enters into the briefing room where he acquires a copy of the tape for Dredd to analyze. He is discovered by SJS Judge Slocum, who attempts to report the deed to Cal. Before he can do so, Cal instead has him paralyzed and pickled for no apparent reason beyond Judge Slocum calling him crazy several progs before. This prevents Slocum from revealing Walter's duplicity, who is free to pass along the tape to Dredd. Once receiving the tape, Dredd's team reveals that Cal has indeed placed subliminal messages in the tape, subjecting judges for weeks to obey him without question. Dredd orders his team to try and make a new tape to cancel out the suggestive messages left by Cal and bring the Judges back to normal.</p><h3>Cal's descent into madness</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702367\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0049916805324\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702367\"><img alt=\"Cal admires his work\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png 601w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cal admires his work\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png 601w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702367-judge_cal_wall.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cal admires his work</figcaption></figure><p>Judge Cal takes a moment to witness the completion of his massive wall, and complements himself for the achievements he has brought to Mega-City One. However, he begins to receive frequent hallucinations of betrayal by his own allies and the whole city. Fearing that his achievements will forever be lost, Cal decides to gas the entire city so as to preserve it as a monument to his reign. He announces his decision to gas the entire city on the television, prompting Judge Dredd to accelerate their plans.</p><p>Using a secret entrance under the tomb of the first Chief Judge, Dredd and his team infiltrate the Grand Hall of Justice. They are able to enter into the briefing room and subdue the guard team within. They replace Cal's tape with their own, and within a few hours of various Judges receiving their briefings, Dredd is able to gain the support of much of the Judges. Realizing that Chief Judge Cal is preparing to gas the city very soon, Dredd rallies the Judges behind him and attempt to storm the Statue of Judgement where Cal hopes tobe in the best position to see the gassing of the city.</p><p>Judge Dredd is able to break through the Klegg mercenaries guarding the statue, who were planning to leave before the city was gassed and were in no mood to fight. The Klegg are gunned down mercilessly in revenge for their actions, among them Grampus. Dredd and his allies are able to breach the reinforced doors blocking the entrance to the statue, allowing them to ascend the statue.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702379\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4735152487961\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702379\"><img alt=\"Fergee saves the city\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png 623w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fergee saves the city\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png 623w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702379-cal_s_death.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fergee saves the city</figcaption></figure><p>Cal meanwhile enjoys the view from the statue, with his remaining aides whispering to themselves that they should try and take down Cal in order to avoid retribution from the other Judges. Cal offers them a toast of wine that is spiked with poison, and gleefully proclaims to him that he knew they would backstab him as he saw in his hallucinations. Shortly afterwards, Fergee leads the assault of the Judges into the chamber but is gunned down by Cal. Dredd orders Cal to stand down but he refuses, showing that he still has influence on the Judges despite their attempts to counteract his brainwashing. Before he can push the switch to gas the city, Fergee rises despite his wounds and grabs Cal, throwing the both of them off the balcony along with several Judges Cal ordered to try and save him. With his death, Judge Cal's reign of terror is ended and his attempt to kill the population of Mega-City One narrowly averted.</p><h2>Aftermath</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702381-fergee_statue.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702381\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5109034267913\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702381-fergee_statue.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702381\"><img alt=\"Statue of Fergee\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702381-fergee_statue.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702381-fergee_statue.png 321w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702381-fergee_statue.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Statue of Fergee\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702381-fergee_statue.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/139574/2702381-fergee_statue.png 321w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139574/2702381-fergee_statue.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Statue of Fergee</figcaption></figure><p>With Cal Dead, the Judges go about recreating the Council of Five and elect a new Chief Judge. Despite popular demands for him to stand for the position, Judge Dredd passes the honor to one of his tutor allies, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53624\" href=\"/chief-judge-griffin/4005-53624/\" slug=\"chief-judge-griffin\">Judge Griffin</a>. Judge Dredd states that Griffin is better suited for the job than he is due to his experience and age, and pointing out that he is better suited for the life of a street judge. Dredd, aware of the importance that Fergee, a reject of the undercity and underclass criminal element, was the one that ultimately saved the city, has a memorial built for Fergee.</p><p>Many of Judge Cal's actions would leave a deep scar on the city due to the implied economic damage and high death toll from executions, though it would later be overshadowed by the consequences of the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56740\" href=\"/the-apocalypse-war/4045-56740/\" slug=\"the-apocalypse-war\">Apocalypse War</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56231\" href=\"/judge-dredd-necropolis/4045-56231/\" slug=\"judge-dredd-necropolis\">Necropolis</a>. The actions of Judge Cal would be felt nearly 17 years later when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82356\" href=\"/judge-jura-edgar/4005-82356/\" slug=\"judge-jura-edgar\">Judge Edgar</a>, the head of the Public Surveillance Unit, is found by Dredd to be in possession of highly sensitive files belonging to Judge Cal during his time as the head of the SJS. The files contained the sum of Cal's investigations into the lives of all the Judges, including major ones, in an attempt to amass material for blackmail. The danger of the documents ends up setting the downfall of Judge Edgar when Dredd realizes that she could also use the files to increase her power much like Cal did.</p><p>Most notably, the massive wall that Judge Cal constructed to prevent escape from the city would end up becoming in its own right an iconic feature of Mega-City One in future progs, mostly as a defensive feature and as a means to enforce their mutant segregation laws by preventing the entry of mutants from the Cursed Earth. While implied that Judge Cal's reinstatement of the death penalty would be repealed, the sentence would end up being used by Judges again in later progs as another way the writers of Judge Dredd to emphasize the repressive nature of Dredd's world.</p><h2>Film</h2><p>The 1995 film <a data-ref-id=\"4025-37\" href=\"/judge-dredd/4025-37/\" slug=\"judge-dredd\">Judge Dredd</a> took inspiration from different story arcs of Judge Dredd. Judge Cal's insanity and rise to power is somewhat filled by the actions of Judge Rico in that movie, as well as Dredd being framed for a crime. Fergee is also a main character, though he is simply a common criminal and has no relation to the comic Fergee beyond occupying a role of comic relief.</p><p>In the 2012 film <a data-ref-id=\"4025-1313\" href=\"/dredd/4025-1313/\" slug=\"dredd\">Dredd</a>, the police crime reports mentions a riot at \"Fergee Memorial Park\", a reference to the parks commissioned in honor of Fergee by Judge Dredd after the events of the Day the Law Died.</p>",

But this Ghost won't be laid to rest until he's run Wolverine through a gauntlet of Adamantium weapons, killing the mutant maverick with the very metal that's saved his life so many times! Unwilling to risk his friends, Wolverine stands alone in a story of intrigue, romance and devastation, culminating in a clash between two killers!    </p>",

The three heroes escape to the roof, but as Eden teleports back to Inside Straight, he fails to stop the Dark Avengers from following through, and the self destruct sequence is initiated. The rest of the Secret Warriors, including a recovering Yo-Yo and a huge number of Nick Fury LMDs battle the Dark Avengers and escape back to Fury base #17, The Cocoon while the base explodes.</p><p>Nick Fury meanwhile goes to Toronto, Canada where he recruits former <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" slug=\"shield\">SHIELD</a> agent <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25685\" href=\"/john-garrett/4005-25685/\" slug=\"john-garrett\">John Garrett</a>. The two track down US Treasury staffer Seth Waters, who they suspect of being a spy, possibly for HYDRA. Garrett meets Waters in his office in Washington DC, where Seth reveals that he knows Garrett was Aquarius: a member of the original Zodiac twelve from the Pieta incident. Later at night in New York City, Fury breaks into Stark Tower with the help of Garrett, and he goes to meet Osborn. Fury tells Osborn about Seth Waters and has Osborn bring him in for questioning. After being tortured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\" href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" slug=\"bullseye\">Bullseye</a>, Waters gives up a name ' <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57417\" href=\"/leviathan/4060-57417/\" slug=\"leviathan\">Leviathan</a>,' at which point John Garrett shoots a massively powerful rifle through the building walls, killing Waters. Fury escapes with the data chip belonging to Waters to base #7 Pieta, where he learns that Leviathan is the Russian rival spy organization, formed to counter HYDRA and SHIELD.</p><p>In flashback, we learn that in ancient history, Phobos had killed his father Ares with a powerful sword called Grasscutter during a war between the Gods. Later, Ares entrusts Phobos to Nick Fury's teaching and care, before bringing him before the assembled Gods of Earth's many pantheons, where he is named God of Fear. Ares tells him he will not become a true God until he dies and is reborn.</p><p>This story arc is significant for bringing into play a third, global secret organization: Leviathan, begun by the Russian leaders <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70202\" href=\"/magadan/4005-70202/\" slug=\"magadan\">Magadan</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70203\" href=\"/orion/4005-70203/\" slug=\"orion\">Orion</a> in response to SHIELD and HYDRA.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-204287\" href=\"/secret-warriors-god-of-fear-god-of-war-secret-warriors-god-of-fear-god-of-war/4000-204287/\" slug=\"secret-warriors-god-of-fear-god-of-war-secret-warriors-god-of-fear-god-of-war\">Secret Warriors: God of Fear, God of War</a></li></ul>",

Next, at an undersea HYDRA base called The Hive, he supervises as a young man is transformed into '<a data-ref-id=\"4005-60718\" href=\"/the-hive/4005-60718/\" slug=\"the-hive\">                      The Hive</a>' by genetically altered parasites. 5 years before the present, he reveals to Strucker on Hydra Island that he is dying. 2 years before the present, a sick and dying Kraken (actually Daniel Whitehall), is confronted and killed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5076\" href=\"/jake-fury/4005-5076/\" slug=\"jake-fury\">                 Jake Fury</a>.<br/>In Japan at the Clan Yashida household, Leviathan agents attack <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3174\" href=\"/silver-samurai/4005-3174/\" slug=\"silver-samurai\">              Silver Samurai</a>, in search of 'the box.' They next attack the HYDRA shipyard base 'Nemesis' where they encounter The Gorgon and kidnap <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3420\" href=\"/viper/4005-3420/\" slug=\"viper\">             Viper</a>, again hoping to obtain the box. They bring her to their base 'The Long Winter.' At the HYDRA base Gehenna, Strucker and Kraken suspect there is a traitor in their midst and order psi-scans of everyone in their organization, but Madame Hydra (actually <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23797\" href=\"/contessa-valentina-allegro-de-la-fontaine/4005-23797/\" slug=\"contessa-valentina-allegro-de-la-fontaine\">            the Contessa</a>) leaves before she can be probed. 15 years ago in Rome, The Contessa had witnessed as her two parents (Russian spies) had been killed in an explosion.

The Contessa has the box that Leviathan wants. She brings it to them and kills Viper. Using the alien power source inside the box, Leviathan bring <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70203\" href=\"/orion/4005-70203/\" slug=\"orion\">         Orion</a> (Viktor Uvarov) back to life from suspended animation. When HYDRA arrive on the scene later, they find only Viper's dead body, which is revived by The Hive and turned into a new Madame Hydra. Orion has left them a message suggesting a meeting at 'The Crown' HYDRA base. At the meeting, Orion suggests a subservient role for HYDRA, underneath their control, which obviously doesn't go down well.<br/>Meanwhile, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54525\" href=\"/slingshot/4005-54525/\" slug=\"slingshot\">        YoYo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67274\" href=\"/stonewall/4005-67274/\" slug=\"stonewall\">       Stonewall</a> travel together to meet their parents.

Although she doesn't say it, he knows she's working against him. Hurt, he returns to base and angrily tells Daisy there are no happy endings. She responds by going to JT James (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-54526\" href=\"/hellfire/4005-54526/\" slug=\"hellfire\">  Hellfire</a>) and kissing him passionately. Secretly, later Hellfire is met by Baron von Strucker, who tracked him down by the money he took from the bank heist. Hellfire agrees to betray Nick in return for keeping Daisy safe from harm.",

    "deck": "An epic, action-packed arc featuring the debut of an-all new, all different Deathlok. Killer cyborgs have come from the future to kill the heroes of today, while Wolverine embarks on an international pub crawl with a certain recently reborn Sentinel of Liberty. Beer and bullets  galore!",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>Tomorrow Dies Today begins just after the return of <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Steve Rogers</a>. Rogers is back from the dead and has handed over the shield to <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky Barnes</a>. <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> took Rogers' death, (his second death), extremely hard and is still having a hard time with his emotional state now that Rogers is back. Wolverine insists on Rogers coming with him on a world-wide pub crawl and they head out in the Blackbird with Nightcrawler helping out as \"designated driver\".</p><p>As the two friends make their way across the globe Deathlok shows up and is on a mission; seeking out various mutants for execution. Once the pub-crawl is over, Wolverine is approached by a young woman named Miranda Bayer claiming to know the future and who then warns him that there's not one, but many Deathloks out killing people with super powers.</p><p>At this point it is revealed that the story is really taking place 20-25 years in the future with present day being in the past. Wolverine is one of the last surviving mutants in the world and has joined up with an underground military group that is attempting to fight the cyborgs. Miranda Bayer is the squad leader and they have discovered that the cyborgs are being sent back in time, by a company called Roxxon, in order to execute all the super-heroes they can. This company has come to not only rule Earth, but much of the known universe as well, by exterminating every threat to their power. The group Wolverine has joined is headed by an unknown person called \"the General\" and they gear up for a mission to finally destroy the machine being used for time travel by Roxxon.</p><p>The future timeline reveals that Roxxon based their work on that of Dr. David Heimerdinger, (former H.A.M.M.E.R. scientist who created cybernetic, zombies for Osborne during the <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a>) and have been creating the cyborgs using the bodies of psychopathic murderers. As more cyborgs are sent into the past, present day heroes begin assembling to battle the growing threat with Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-man, Thing, Spider-woman and others teaming up.</p><p>One cyborg in particular is shown to still be conscious behind the AI that is controlling his modified body. The back story of how he was a convicted murderer, his rebirth as a cyborg and his ongoing murderous rage plays out in conversations with his AI controller. While the AI strives to understand human emotion and wants to expand what makes it unique, the mind of its host body is proud of the nearly 350 kills he has so far. He is the main cyborg that is fighting in the past as his blood lust helps him excel in his task. The present day Miranda Bayer is not telepathic but has instead been fed memories by her future self using the same time-displacement technology that Roxxon has been using. Once \"the General\" discovers the previous identities of the cyborgs his people are facing, he uses that technology to inform the younger Miranda. She seeks out the child that will become the cyborg leader and decides it would be better to murder the child than let that happen.</p><p>As she holds the child at knife point, in front of the monster he will eventually become, she realizes that no matter what, she is not a monster and instead of killing the child, decides to right the wrongs that have lead to this child becoming that monster. The future Miranda is shown fighting her way to the time machine when she realizes that the cyborg she is fighting is the same one she once showed compassion to. She allows herself to be killed in order to show this AI what sacrifice truly means. She gives up her fight to this cyborg knowing very soon it will witness her doing the opposite to the child she once held hostage. As she dies she demands that the cyborg finally seek out the answers to the questions it has always had regarding human emotion and what it means to not only care, but to finally ask 'Why?'. Miranda believes that doing this is the only way to ensure, that in the past, this cyborg finally makes the right decision. Once the AI has this awakening of the mind it takes control of the host body and helps the heroes defeat all of the other cyborg assassins before going his own way. The AI claims, as he walks away, \"for the first time in my existence I am excited at the thought of tomorrow\".</p><p>After the battle has been won, the heroes wonder if they did indeed change the future. This question is answered as the secret identity of \"the General\" is revealed. After showing his face he begins to take in all of the sacrifices his people have made and realizes that he himself must make one final sacrifice in order to ensure that the actions of those he cared about, that were made for a better future, were not made in vain.</p><p>Marvel Knights Animation will release a motion comic version on  May 13, 2014.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/wolverine-weapon-x-tomorrow-dies-today/4050-36277/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36277\">Wolverine Weapon X: Tomorrow Dies Today</a></li></ul>",

She relates to them details of her life after she escaped and found her relatives the Kinneys, saving Debbie and Megan Kinney from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41489\" href=\"/kimura/4005-41489/\" slug=\"kimura\">Kimura</a>. Captain America finally decides to let X-23 go instead of handing her in for prosecution for her crimes, letting her seek her own way to the X-Men.</p><p>This story arc served to build on details of X-23's back story, inserting the new character of Kimura into her origin story. Kimura would go on to be one of X-23's arch-nemeses.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p>Laura is kidnapped and interrogated. In flashback, X-23 is forced by the facility to mirror a hologram program of Weapon X. Dr. Sarah Kinney is shown in the observation booth as she argues frantically with the director, Dr. Martin Sutter, begging him to end the program. X-23 suddenly out-performs the program by improvising and killing her assailant--a simulated Grizzly bear--with her foot claw, which Weapon X does not have. She is shown approaching the simulation of Weapon X and staring at him, as the off-panel voice in the present continues to demand her to answer the question: \"Are you X-23?\"</p><p>She tells them she is not, and another voice says that she is telling the truth, while the first voice says this is not possible. A locket is shown to X-23, with a picture of Dr. Kinney; she tells them that it is her mother. She remembers the day when she killed Sarah (because of the trigger scent). She had stayed with Sarah until she was covered with snow. Helicopters appeared in the distance, and Laura grabbed the dropped book and letter, shoved them back into Sarah's bag, then ran off (returning once to touch Sarah's cheek). The helicopter found her, and she swiftly dealt with the incoming wave of facility personnel; however she couldn't hurt Kimura, who had also shown up. She instead shot down a tree with a gun procured off a fallen facility officer. This caused the ice beneath them to shatter, and both she and Kimura were buried. Laura resurfaced a few moments later, still holding her mother's bag.</p><p>In the present an unseen voice asks her: \"The girl. Who is she?\" as a hand holds up the other side of the locket, with a picture of a teenaged girl. The scene cuts to show Megan Kinney waking up from a nightmare, about her previous experience as a kidnap victim of a serial killer that X-23 had killed. Laura had hidden outside the Kinney's house in San Fransisco, at fourteen years of age, listening to the Kinneys argue about Megan's emotional problems. She continued to shadow the Kinney family for twenty-one days. On the twenty-second day she knocked on their door and introduced herself to Debbie Kinney, who was astonished to see her sister's daughter. X-23's current captors confer about how \"This isn't going to work!\". Laura continues to reminisce, about how she introduced herself to Megan Kinney, who appeared to have a defiant teenaged nature. Together in Megan's room, Laura asked her why she had drawn so many pictures of the man who kidnapped her. Her cousin began to cry. X-23's captors in the present are revealed to be Captain America and Daredevil (in his Matt Murdock persona).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1213594-40847_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213594\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5439093484419\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1213594-40847_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213594\"><img alt=\"Deceiving Captain America\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1213594-40847_6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1213594-40847_6.jpg 353w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px\" data-width=\"353\"></a><figcaption>Deceiving Captain America</figcaption></figure><p>Captain America hands Murdock a file detailing X-23's crime: the murder of Greg Johnson, which Murdock reads with his fingers. He asks Laura \"Why?\" in a small voice. She replies that it was her mission. Captain America goes on to relate his view of the event, which involves his response to a S.H.I.E.L.D. report on a possible threat to candidate Johnson. He arrived too late and saw the carnage that X-23 had left in her wake. He says \"I've seen my share of senseless death in my time...but this still affected me. And then I heard crying.\" He continues to narrate that he found the handicapped girl amongst the mess (Laura) and took her to an ambulance. He later realized his mistake in letting her go when he was told that the center was locked down since the event. He returned to find the ambulance workers dead.</p><p>X-23 continues to narrate her time in San Fransisco with her relatives. Megan demanded Laura tell her mother about the kidnapping, because she couldn't remember it herself, and wanted to know why her mother had been concealing the event from her. Debbie was upset and sorry about Megan, and apologized to Laura. She then offered her niece some of her daughter's clothes, but apologized for the Gothic style of the outfits (which Laura appeared to like, explaining her later tastes for the style). Laura told Debbie that she would follow Megan to school by tracking her scent. In reality, the trail led to the wharf, where she imparted the story of her creation very briefly to her cousin. They then headed toward school, where Laura got into various situations with her odd blunt, clinical manner and dangerous knowledge of how to kill people. She got them sent to the principal's office twice in one afternoon and then got them suspended. Laura and Megan took off for a joy ride in the Principal's car. This continued into a museum trip, a movie at the theater, an amusement park, a pet store, Tiffany's jewelry store (where Laura bought Megan several pieces), a Dazzler concert, and ended with them talking more about Laura's past on the wharf. They returned to Megan's home, where Debbie was very angry and chewed them out for not telling her where they were. Megan and Debbie shared a bonding moment and Megan apologized to her mother \"for everything\", having changed her mind after hearing Laura's tale of having to kill her own mother.

She describes the three-year training process, consumed with experiences of different forms of water torture (with trigger scent in place of water). She killed a dog without a second thought on the first trigger-scent trial. Murdock expresses disbelief, but Captain America asks if this scent was used on all her missions. Laura explains how it was only used in instances when the facility did not trust her to kill the target, or if the target was considered exceptional. She goes on to reminisce about killing a man with the ability to become invisible: DiLorenzo ( <a href=\"../../fade/29-42052/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fade</a>), on a job for Wilson Fisk ( <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingpin</a>). Captain America tells her he knew about DiLorenzo, and tells her that the man had a wife and child that disappeared. He asks her if she had anything to do with this, and Laura looks like she is in pain when she says \"Yes\".</p><p>Captain America prods her to continue with the San Fransisco story. Laura explains how she and Megan were out on the streets when Megan received a call on the phone that Debbie was sick and that they should pick up some cold medicine. Megan asked if Laura had some money; she explained that she had one hundred forty-seven thousand six hundred and ninety-two dollars. Megan was astonished and asked whether she could borrow money from Laura, who replied that she could, but that it was at Megan's house. Just then Laura saw Wolverine and the other <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-men</a> (when <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor Charles Xavier</a> announced to the world that he is a mutant) on a TV in an electronics store window. She stopped, and was mesmerized by the man she was replicated from. Megan said that they had to go home and get cash.</p><p>At the Kinney house, Desmond brought tea to Debbie. He came downstairs just as Megan opened the door on him, spilling the tea on his front. It became apparent that the tea was laced with trigger scent and Desmond began to panic. Megan touched Desmond to comfort him, transferring the scent onto herself. Laura entered a blind rage. Captain America asks her if she killed Megan and Debbie, while Murdock reminds him that she was acting under the influence of a controlling substance. Rogers replies that he knows but he needs to uncover the story, and that the judgment on X-23 is up to someone else. He asks Laura to continue narrating. Desmond yelled on the phone for Kimura as he ran away, but X-23 reached him first and slaughtered him mercilessly while Megan looked on, horrified and begging her to stop. Scared by the screaming downstairs, Debbie spilled the tea on her front, just about to drink it. Megan suddenly remembered Laura's explanation of how trigger scent worked, and realized that the scent is in the tea. She ran upstairs for her mother, as Laura became aware that Megan was covered in the scent. She demanded to know if Debbie drank the tea; she responded that she did not. Megan grabbed her hand, ran to the bathroom with her mother in tow, then shoved her into the bath tub and started the shower just as Laura appeared to kill them.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/130061-138415-kimura.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-130061\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3525\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:135.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/130061-138415-kimura.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-130061\"><img alt=\"Kimura\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/130061-138415-kimura.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/130061-138415-kimura.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kimura\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/130061-138415-kimura.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/130061-138415-kimura.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kimura</figcaption></figure><p>The water washed away the trigger scent just in time, and Laura smelled the air as her eyes cleared, but the trouble wasn't over. Kimura had just arrived. Captain America interrupts to ask Laura who is Kimura, a woman she has now mentioned twice. When Laura was twelve years old, she first met the woman five days after her claws were laced with Adamantium. She narrates how Dr. Rice instructed her to kill Kimura, and how she had failed, as the woman's skin was indestructible. Laura was then punished for her failure with a brutal beating in which Kimura broke her nose and kicked her in the stomach multiple times. She was told that Kimura was now her handler, and would punish her if she failed a mission or disobeyed an order. She relates how Kimura <i>did</i> punish her, on many different occasions (Kimura is seen appearing in many scenes shown in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-20027\" href=\"/x-23-innocence-lost/4050-20027/\" slug=\"x-23-innocence-lost\"><i>Innocence Lost</i></a>). Captain America asks if Kimura is a mutant too, but Laura says that the facility designed her. Steve asks her to continue the San Fransisco story. She details how she took Megan and Debbie to the basement and burst a water pipe, so they would not show up on heat detectors. Then she details how she dealt with the arriving Facility personnel, and how Kimura found her and broke her neck. Kimura taunted her and handcuffed their wrists together, then dragged her downstairs and after speaking to Laura's relatives (while holding a crossbow at Megan), she fired her weapon. Laura cut the arrow in half before it could reach her cousin, then began to try to escape, but discovered that the cuffs were Adamantium and that her claws couldn't cut through them. X-23 tried to beat Kimura off with physical violence but failed, and the woman taunted her, starting to put her finger through Megan's chest, over her heart. Laura cut off her hand to escape the cuff, then attached Kimura to a water pipe with the empty cuff. As Laura gave her cousin instructions to pack a bag in three minutes and leave the house, Kimura threatened that: \"I'll kill you! There's nowhere you can run I won't find you! You think you've saved her?! You're wrong! Megan is dead! Debbie is dead! Everyone you love will die! And I'll be the one that kills them!\". Laura, in the present, says that Kimura was telling the truth, and how she couldn't let that happen. Murdock asks what happened, Rogers says \"I'll tell you what she did\".</p><p>Steve Rogers details how Laura blew up the Kinneys' house by breaking a gas pipe downstairs, then turning on a light bulb. He notes that Kimura was not amongst the twenty-seven bodies in the wreckage (on Laura's questioning). Murdock asks what happened to Megan and Debbie. Laura explains she drove them to a hotel, and how Debbie had told her that she had saved their entire family, including Sarah. At the hotel, Laura cut out Debbie's and Megan's pictures and put them in the fake passports Dr. Kinney had procured for herself and her daughter. Megan took some of the unused photos. At the Washington US/Canada border, Megan asked why Laura was saying goodbye, and why she was not coming with them. Debbie understood right away, but Megan didn't. Megan was distraught, and asked how Laura will find them. As Laura turned to go, Megan stopped her and presented her with the locket containing a picture of Sarah and a picture of herself. Laura thanked them and left, crying, as she narrates \"And that's the last time I saw them.\"</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/245766-60997-x-23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245766\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/245766-60997-x-23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245766\"><img alt=\"Wolverine meets his Clone\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/245766-60997-x-23.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/245766-60997-x-23.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wolverine meets his Clone\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/245766-60997-x-23.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/245766-60997-x-23.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wolverine meets his Clone</figcaption></figure><p>Murdock asks where she went next, and if it was to find Wolverine, to which Laura replies \"Yes\". He then examines Laura's possessions--the Pinocchio book and Laura's mother's letter, and asks her what they are because he cannot read (he is blind). Laura says the blood washed the words of the letter away. Rogers demands for her to continue the narrative. Laura describes tracking Wolverine for a while, then how she confronted him when he left the school one night and camped out near the New York US/Canadian border. Logan informed her that he'd caught her scent an hour ago, and then Laura initiated a violent fight. She surprised him with her ingenuity when she threw dirt into the wounds she cut, to hold them open so that they couldn't heal. He let her gain the upper hand, and asked her what was her problem. On Wolverine pushing her to explain, she shouted: \"We are weapons! We must be stopped! We must be destroyed!\". Wolverine told her to kill him, but that he wouldn't let her kill herself. He went on to tell her that she didn't choose this life, and that she had no choice anyway. He explained that her mother sent him a copy of the letter she'd written to Laura, and that by the time he'd received it, Laura was gone. She imparted how her mother was dead, and that she was forced to kill her. Wolverine gave her his copy of the letter, and told her she had to make a choice: do what the facility wanted her to do, or do what her mother wanted her to do: find her humanity. He offered her a place at the institute, which Laura was hesitant to accept, thinking the facility would find her there. Then helicopters came, carrying Captain America; he caught Laura and took her away for interrogation.</p><p>The next day Daredevil came in after a hard day's work, to a ringing phone. He tells Captain America he should have left her with Wolverine. Rogers is astonished, but Murdock tells him that it is the best chance she will have at a normal life. If they turn her in, the Government will use her as a weapon. He holds up the copy of Sarah's letter and reminds Rogers that it absolves Laura of everything, that she is actually the victim here. Rogers doesn't believe him at first, and takes X-23 to turn her in to the authorities, but has a change of heart when they are outside the S.H.I.E.L.D. substation in Washington, D.C. He takes Laura to a Greyhound bus station instead and tells her to find the X-Men.</p><p>Laura leaves on the bus, watching a little boy with his mother and smiling. The mother shows the boy pictures of an Eagle's claw and asks him what it is; he replies \"Talon.\" This suggests that Talon might have been planned as a codename for Laura initially (this plan never came to fruition, as she is still known as X-23). Laura then begins to read her mother's letter, she cries quietly to herself.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-187208\" href=\"/x-23-target-x-target-x/4000-187208/\" slug=\"x-23-target-x-target-x\">X-23: Target X</a></li></ul>",

    "deck": "The Phoenix Force comes to Malibu Comics.  It possesses Amber Hunt and wreaks havoc on the Ultraverse.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The Phoenix Force is forcefully brought from the Marvel Universe into the Ultraverse by the Alien Ship that caused all the Ultraverse's heroes to gain powers. In an effort to control the Force, the Ship severely damages it and drives it insane so the Force is forced to take a new host to recuperate. It possessed the young hero Prime, and then takes down the combined forces of the X-men and Ultraverse. When the ship tries to take over again, the two teams are able to overtake Prime and Phoenix Force leaves his body and goes to possess the Exile Amber Hunt.</p><p>The newly possessed Amber Hunt fights the X-men, Ultraforce and the newly arrived Exiles (with former x-villain Juggernaut), Night Man and Mantra. Meanwhile the Ship is kidnapping Rex Mundi and his genetic Alternate to get the source code embedded in their DNA so it can reunite with the rest of itself inside the sun using the Phoenix Force to propel the Earth to it. The combined force of heroes infiltrated the ship and rescues Rex and the Alternate, and they free the Phoenix Force from the Great Ship. As the Force attempts to kill the ship for attacking it, the heroes use the various powers to send the Phoenix through a gateway back to its home world.</p><h2>Full Summary</h2><h3>Red Shift</h3><p>In the second issue of all 1995 Malibu titles there was a 3-page flip side story. These 7 parts were a prologue to the Phoenix Resurrection storyline that followed</p><p><u><b>Prime </b></u>- Prime is enjoying his adoring public when he spies Gateway in the crowd smiling at him. When Prime flies down to him he is transported to Manhattan of Earth-616 and hit by a cab. While the cabbie yells at him he sees Gateway sitting over by a tree, but mid-flight over to him, he transports back to the Ultraverse and crashes into the tree. He looks down and see the image of the Phoenix in the painted in the dirt.</p><p><u><b>Night Man </b></u>- Night Man is wandering New York in the rain, pondering his new found mystical abilities when he suddenly sees, through a puddle on the ground, directly into the bedroom of Daimon Hellstrom. Hellstrom at first attacks but then questions his mysterious intruder. He hypothesizes that Night Man is not an attacker but a \"peeping Tom\" from another world. He warns Night Man of cataclysm to come and sends a flaming sword through the portal which, upon entering the other side, becomes a blazing firebird. He warns that the Phoenix would soon be upon his world.</p><p><u><b>Siren </b></u>- Whizzer of Squadron Supreme is intently analyzing data at Mt Pegasus. He ponders the dimensional breaches that have been appearing all over the place and decides to consult other in the field. After no answer from the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, he reaches Beast of the X-men. The two scientists agree to exchange data and contact each other later with more conclusions.</p><p><u><b>Mantra </b></u>- Lauren Sherwood is sitting in a diner hating and revering the popular kids from her school, thinking about if only they knew she was secretly Mantra, when she noticed them looking over at her. They are staring at the little man suddenly sitting next to Lauren: Gateway. Lauren instantly apologizes for the kids and begins to pour her heart out to Gateway, who sits silently. She almost outs her secret identity but composes herself and continues her rambling. Suddenly she notices that he is gone and on the table in front of his seat is the outline of a Phoenix in salt. She gets a sudden ominous feeling about events to come.</p><p><u><b>Exiles </b></u>- Amber Hunt is out on a balcony feelign incredible remorse for the recent atrocity she committed under the control of The Entity. She remembers that a small part of the Entity is still lodged within her, and as she drifts off in thought she begins to envision herself engulfed in a firebird and swears to never allows someone to make her kill again.</p><p><u><b>Rune </b></u>- Rune is attacking a man who regularly and brutally attacks women when the two men are both transported to the grounds of the X-men's headquarters.He sees Storm and Beast through a window and then drags his victims body into the woods where he realizes that he is in someone else's territory. He makes note of the person's scent just as he is teleported back to his own world. And we see Wolverine sitting in shadows.</p><p><u><b>Ultraforce </b></u>- Ultraforce is fighting a former KGB agent assassin named Meat Rack and in a freak occurrence Prototype and Topaz's energies mixed to and Meat Rack to Earth-616. Spider-man is alerted by his Spider sense to the arrival but Thor came by and sent him instantly back to his own world. When Meat Rack arrives back in the Ultraverse, the Black Knight wonders how the villain came be covered with newspapers from his own home world.</p><p><u><b>Generation X </b></u>- Jubilee has returned to Xavier's School to contemplate her recent encounter in the Ultraverse.</p><h3>Genesis</h3><p>The Phoenix Force is flying through space and is heading back to Earth after its long travels through space. A passing rock full of technological wonder passes by and observes the Phoenix before jumping back to its own universe.</p><p> </p><p>The X-men (including Storm, Beast, Wolverine, Rogue and Bishop, together with Generation X's Banshee and Jubilee are all standing in the Terrarium that serves as the training ground for Generation X. Banshee summoned them here and they soon see why: Gateway has drawn a large Phoenix symbol and all of their images (as well as a few others they don't really recognize). Suddenly Gateway teleports them away in the blink in the blink of an eye.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile at Project Pegasus, the Squadron Supreme are watching the readings from the numerous space/time disruptions that have occurred when they see another one abruptly show up. They wonder what this object could be since it is much less then human mass. The scene cuts to the techno-rock that observed the Phoenix reentering this universe and sinking to the bottom of the sea. At the bottom of the sea, the seafloor opens up to accept the meteor and it travels through the caverns and pathways of the Great Ship. The rock unites connects to the Ship, and, as it rises to the ocean surface, it realizes it is almost complete but need a power source to reach its remaining pieces. Luckily it has just found such a power source...</p><p> </p><p>In the Ultraverse Washington D.C., the X-men appear in mid air and promptly crash to the ground. Wolverine thinks the places smells wrong, similar to Night Man who he met recently, and the group deduces that they are now in the Ultraverse, where several of them have been before. They prepare for the usual downscaling of their powers when Bishop points their attention to the sun and the large black blot on it. Elsewhere, the Ship sends a beam of energy into the sky and tears a hole in space and time to Earth-616. On the other side, the Phoenix Force is unwilling dragged through the opening, as the whole scene is broadcast on national television. As Beast marvels at the majesty of the Phoenix Force, Mantra, Amber Hunt, and Night Man all see the firebird . The Ship sends an extraction beam to drain the power of the Phoenix to use for itself. The X-men are disgusted as they watch the Phoenix writhe in pain in the sky. As the Phoenix fights for its freedom, its mind begins to falter and fracture, but still it battles the Ship attempting to enter the Ships mind. The sea boils as the Ship reels from the Phoenix's attack, and the Phoenix, severely wounded, desperately searches for a host so it may heal itself.</p><p> </p><p>As the X-men decide how best to help the situation, Prime arrives and says since they obviously know the entity they are just as guilty and he is arresting them. Wolverine, is his way, tries talking to Prime but Prime decks him which causes Rogue to attack. Elsewhere, Rex Mundi, the original Ultra, observes the events taking place and decides to send his agents, while in another headquarters The Alternate, Rex Mundi's female genetic counterpart, also observes the Phoenix and sends her own agents, The Solution.</p><p> </p><p>The Phoenix selects and dismisses candidate after candidate from the Freex, the Strangers, Solitaire, Sludge, Necromantra...however in the middle of a pitched battle with the X-men, the Phoenix decides upon Prime for its new host. As the X-men try to decide how to handled the newly hosted Phoenix, the Brand-new Phoenix-Prime revels in his/her/its new host body and the power that comes with it. It tells the X-men to run, as it is about to turn this entire world to cinder for abusing it. Meanwhile at Headless Cross, Cromwell becomes aware of the events unfolding and alerts the rest of Ultraforce.</p><p> </p><p>Back in Washington, Beast postulates that the Phoenix, like them, is operating at a reduced power level while Storm, Banshee and Rogue attack Phoenix-Prime head on to no avail. When Phoenix fries Wolverine, he jumps right out of the flames and lunges at Prime, claws out. Then the Ship decides to take control of the Phoenix, giving Prime a chance to try and expel the entity from his body. The X-men take this opportunity to pounce on Prime. On the Lower East Side of Manhattan,</p><p> </p><p>Interlude: Rose Autumn is sitting home with her father watching TV when a pain suddenly shoots through her head and the Phoenix emblem appears in her eyes. She screams in pain and her fathers runs to her. They both wonder whats happening...</p><p> </p><p>In Washington, Ultraforce arrives on the scene and even as the Black Knight recognizes the X-men, Topaz, Ghoul and Prototype attack the team they see ganging up on their teammate. Before the battle gets any worse, the Black Knight jumps in the middle and diffuses both teams. While Black Knight and Storm catch each other up to speed, Phoenix-Prime rises and zaps the very lifeforce from everyone present, but the Ship once again attempts to take control and Prime falls to the ground. Both teams beset the fallen possessed hero and while he makes attempts to throw them off they are too much for him. The strain of fighting the teams gives Prime the reprieve he needs to fully expel the Phoenix from his body and as he collapses he says he saw into the mind of the Phoenix and he knows what is coming and that the Phoenix is now insane. In one part of California, Lauren Sherwood becomes Mantra and travels after the firebird she saw in her vision, while in another part of California Night Man opens a door in the air and steps through after the Phoenix that Hellstorm warned him about.</p><p> </p><p>Interlude: Back on the Lower East Side, Rose is staring out the window wishing she could go out, but the doctor and father says she needs to rest. She thinks about the flaming bird image she saw and wonders why it seemed so familiar. On the street, an older blond man watches her from the street.</p><p> </p><p>While traveling to New York on Ultraforce's ship Black Knight asks Storm to brief Ultraforce on the Phoenix's history. She recounts the story of the space mission that ended with Jean Grey piloting a spaceship through a radiation storm and how Jean almost died until she was saved and replaced by the Phoenix. We get a quick run through of the M'Kraan story and the Dark Phoenix Saga where the false Jean died on the Moon. The conversation soon becomes a debate over can they kill the Phoenix and whether they should kill it. Ultraforce wants to kill the being whereas the X-men think it should be saved and preserved with Black Knight siding on the side of Ultraforce. Wolverine interrupts and begs the question what if it can't be killed?</p><p> </p><p>On a balcony in New York City, Amber Hunt is with Cain Marko, the Juggernaut, and she tells him of her vision where the Phoenix comes for her. Rather then fight it she plans to let it take her and try to fight for control from within. She still feels responsible for the many deaths that happened while she was controlled by \"The Entity\" and sees this as her chance to make things right. As he tries to say he won't let that happen, she knocks him out and sees the Phoenix coming for her in the distance. Ultraforce notices that it stopped right over Manhattan and Prototype points out that it found its new host as the Phoenix-possessed Amber Hunt floats above New York.</p><h3>Revelations</h3><p>Amber relishes in her newfound power as she descends gently from the sky. A block away Ultraforce and the X-men arrive in the scene just as Amber/Phoenix notices the arrival of Quattro and Gun Nut. Rex Mundi observes from his sanctum thinking how he should have disposed of Amber long ago. Back in New York, the Solution shows up and a fight breaks out between them and Quattro while Amber's mind travels down into the alien ships that brought the Phoenix to this world, and discovers the true goal of the ship.</p><p> </p><p>In Manhattan, as Storm is wondering what is happening suddenly the X-men's old enemy the Juggernaut shows up with his team the Exiles, of whom Amber is a member. Everyone breaks into a large melee, and the Phoenix screams as the Great Ship takes control of her form. Wanting to study them for traces of the microorganisms it craved, the ship controlled Phoenix drops everyone, with Juggernaut falling last. Inside the ship, the disembodied mind of Amber Hunt watches as her body forcibly searches the minds of the leaders of Quattro and the Solution and find that their powers came from two different sources. The X-men and Ultraforce attacked together and momentarily weakens her before she knocks them all back. The X-men and Ultraforce convince the other teams to work together with them as Mantra appears on a nearby roof to join the fray and Nightman appears from a street level portal. With all the heroes working together, they get the Phoenix on the ropes.</p><p> </p><p>In the nearby apartment of Autumn Rose and her father, Autumn looks out the window and sees the Phoenix firebird heading for her building. As it crashes into her building, they are sent falling to the floor below them. In a sudden show of strength, Autumn lifts a massive piece of debris off of her father, but she doesn't have time to marvel at her new power as she discovers that her father is a robot. Beast and Bishop attempt to calm her but in her agitated state she transforms into golden skinned being of energy and blasts the Phoenix before both women collapse to the ground and Autumn reverts to her human form.</p><p> </p><p>As the ship only needs the Phoenix and not Amber, Amber falls to the ground as the Phoenix rips from her body and flies away. All present are stunned to watch the Phoenix split into two in midair and go off in separate directions. As the combined teams discuss splitting in two to chase the Phoenixes but Amber tells them that they would never be able to catch them but that she knows what they are doing. She tells them that if they all work together then they MAY be able to stop the ship from using the Phoenix to drive the Earth into the Sun.</p><p> </p><p>She recounts the story of the Break-thru when she was possessed by the ship and Black September when it was reawakened. The ship wants to drive the Earth into the Sun to recombine with its missing parts but needs its guidance system, or pilot, in order to do this which was hidden inside the body of the first Ultra, Rex Mundi and, since her created his mate as his own genetic double, Regina, the Alternate. The ship then decided to acquire all copies of the pilot program and has sent the Phoenix Force to abduct them.</p><p> </p><p>As the large group of superbeing leave Manhattan to save the world, an older blond man watches them go and then, along with Autumn robotic father and Autumn unconscious body, disappears.</p><p> </p><p>Rex Mundi and the Alternate are brought to the ship by the Phoenix and then both of them are plugged into the ships techno-organic machinery. It keeps them sedate with nanotech as it rebuilds them as part of the living ship. In the lower levels of the vessel the united assemblage of Ultras mutants appear through one of Gate's portals in a wreckage yard of old planes and ships (giving an explanation for the Bermuda Triangle). As they are marveling at the sight, they are besieged by creatures acting as the ships \"anti-bodies\" while in the control room, the ship is downloading the pilot program piece by piece from its captives and funneling Phoenix energy into the Earth mantle. Volcanos erupt all across the world as the Great Ship revs its engines preparing to propel the Earth.</p><p> </p><p>In the midst of all the fighting, Mantra notices Topaz glaring at her, but the reason for this is not revealed.</p><p> </p><p>One group continues to fight the techno-organic beasts while another group breaks off to attempt to stop the ship's plan. As the second group reaches the control room door, Prime enter and is beset by more monstrosities while Amber goes to the control panel to try and stop the process. The combined voice of Rex and the Alternate telling them to stop what they are doing but after brief discussion Black Knight makes the call to destroy the machine. Wolverine does so and frees Rex and Regina, but the Phoenix, wounded and trying to reform, begins to build in power.</p><p> </p><p>Across the globe, the volcanoes on the verge of eruption being to calm and settle but back in the Great Ship magma begins to pour through the tunnels of that were dug below it. Using Gate's portal and a spell from Book, the gathered heroes (including Rex and his Alternate) transport to the deck of a nearby tanker. Suddenly Shruiken cries out for everyone to look out to the sea as the water boils and the Phoenix bursts from the ocean. It hangs in the air for a moment before turning its searing energy on the Great Ship at the bottom of the ocean. They all decide that the Phoenix can't be allowed to destroy the Great Ship, lest it also destroy the world. Using Gate's portal and Amber's connection to the ship to boost its power, the rest of the heroes use their formidable powers to push the Phoenix through the gate back to its original universe...and 4 billion years in the past. It folds in on itself as it prepares to travel back to its proper place and time. In the resulting explosion from its travel vacuum, large fragments of rock are sent flying into space, to eventually intersect with a large sentient alien ship.</p><p> </p><p>Back in the Ultraverse on the tanker, Rex and Quattro have abruptly and subtly departed. Regina talks about how she had hoped for better from Rex after their experience with the ship but she wasn't surprised by his departure either. Suddenly Gateway shows up on Ultraforce flying transport and all the heroes say goodbye and depart just before Gateway teleports the X-men back to their home dimension.</p><p> </p><p>On the surface of the sun, if you look really closely, you can see a spot that is the remains of the great ship. It knows it will be reunited one day...just not today. But it is very patient.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/the-phoenix-resurrection/4050-40642/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-40642\"> The Phoenix Resurrection #0</a> (Collects the #2 Flip Issues + Generation X Original Story)</li><li><a href=\"/the-phoenix-resurrection-red-shift/4050-18473/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18473\"> The Phoenix Resurrection: RedShift #0</a> (Collects the #2 Flip Issues)</li></ul>",

Uncharacteristically he completely opened up to him, discussing personal philosophy, lovers, relatives, etc. The vagrant in question was the enigmatic World Mage <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45803\" href=\"/mirth/4005-45803/\" slug=\"mirth\">Mirth</a>, and he would soon change Kevin's life forever. Shortly after his meeting with Mirth, Kevin jumps in to defend a complete stranger that is being attacked by some kind of creature (which was later revealed to be a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59162\" href=\"/grackleflints/4060-59162/\" slug=\"grackleflints\">Grackleflint</a>) and after a prolonged fight, he noticed that he took no damage. When Kevin returned home for the night, Mirth was waiting for him, and answered a few of his questions. When Kevin woke up the next day he wrote it all off as a dream until he was again attacked and thrown onto subway tracks only to be run over by a train. However, when he got back up he found his clothes torn to shreds but he had again taken no damage. Shaken, but relatively unharmed Kevin went to a diner where Mirth again appeared and teleported them to a skyscraper roof. Kevin freaked out, revealing that he was acrophobic. Mirth capitulated, and teleported them to a quiet nearby park. There he answered only a few more of Kevin's questions, specifically why Kevin got run over by a subway train and lived, yet could still get a splinter from a bench. Mirth explains that Kevin has super powers, but they only manifest when they're needed. Mirth then reveals that he can see visions, specifically visions involving people that are meant to help Kevin. Responding to Mirth's vision, they meet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-78385\" href=\"/edsel/4005-78385/\" slug=\"edsel\">Edsel</a>, who was being attacked by another Grackleflint. Kevin manages to fend off the monster and Edsel mysteriously bows before Kevin. Kevin rants, wondering whats going on and Mirth plays the incident off as simple confusion on her part. Kevin helps fix Edsel's car and the trio leave the scene. While they're in transit Mirth charms Edsel's bat but he's actually hiding it from Kevin. The bat is Kevin's weapon, but he's not ready to learn the truth of it yet. They go to an unused stadium to talk stuff out and Mirth fixes Kev's tattered clothing. Mirth reveals that the team's purpose is to prevent the dark forces from finding the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84078\" href=\"/fisher-king/4005-84078/\" slug=\"fisher-king\">Fisher King</a>, the one thing that can set off the balance of good and evil. Kevin is still skeptical about all this and wonders what's really going on.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375702-letter_25.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2375702\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3546637744035\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:135.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375702-letter_25.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2375702\"><img alt=\"Marhault Ogre\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375702-letter_25.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375702-letter_25.jpeg 1844w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/104794/2375702-letter_25.jpeg 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375702-letter_25.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Marhault Ogre</figcaption></figure><p>While hiding out in the stadium the team is attacked again, this time by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84081\" href=\"/marhault-ogre/4005-84081/\" slug=\"marhault-ogre\">Marhault Ogre</a>. With Edsel's help Kevin is able to kill the beast, sending it back into the faerie realm from whence it came. Kevin reveals he has a crippling fear of killing after what happened to a dog that he had as a child. He also speaks of all the anger he has held back for years in order to keep himself in control. Mirth reassures him he needs to let loose and become the great warrior he's meant to be. Suddenly they hear police sirens responding to the disturbance. The team tries to escape but they are caught and Kevin is arrested. While he's in jail he tells the other inmates about his powers but when he tries to prove it to them it doesn't work. Mirth reappears and when Kevin asks about this, Mirth explains that he needs to be in the struggle for the powers to activate. The prison bars keep him from the fight. Kevin's powers activate and he escapes the jail cell. Mirth then shifts them onto a new plane and helps wipe the minds of anyone involved in the arrest along with all the physical data. While in this other realm they meet their next partner <a data-ref-id=\"4005-78386\" href=\"/sean-knight/4005-78386/\" slug=\"sean-knight\">Sean Knight</a>. Sean had somehow managed to shift onto the same plane as Kevin and Mirth, and they find him cowering behind a desk. The team gets attacked by a trio of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59159\" href=\"/redcaps/4060-59159/\" slug=\"redcaps\">Red Caps</a> which Kevin quickly dispatches. Mirth reveals to Sean that he is a ghost and offers him a spot on the team which he accepts. They leave the police station, stopping to get Edsel, and the four of them head to Kevin's apartment. Shortly after they arrive, Kevin is attacked by a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59160\" href=\"/leanhaun-sidhe/4060-59160/\" slug=\"leanhaun-sidhe\">Leanhaun Sidhe</a>. She charms Kevin to the point where he can't focus and attempts to drink his blood. Edsel jumps in at the last second and saves him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2375632\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3201730665224\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2375632\"><img alt=\"Stanis is captured\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg 1849w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Stanis is captured\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg 1849w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375632-stanis_3.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stanis is captured</figcaption></figure><p>After they defeat the Leanhaun Sidhe they find <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84086\" href=\"/stanis-grackleflint/4005-84086/\" slug=\"stanis-grackleflint\">Stanis</a> Grackleflint spying on them.

Kevin manages to steer the car off course but sends it careening into his apartment complex, burning it down. Mirth reveals that he is leaving to sequester himself in The Faerie Realms. Kevin feels angry and abandoned, and still holds on to his skepticism.

In the end though, Kevin cannot deny his responsibility, and he picks up the bat, ready to face his final showdown with the Umbra Sprite.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2375713\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.42432581177766\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2375713\"><img alt=\"Kevin and Mirth leave town\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg 1817w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kevin and Mirth leave town\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg 1817w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2375713-letter_168.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kevin and Mirth leave town</figcaption></figure><p>Mirth and Kevin return to the Styx casino. Mirth explains that Kevin has to enter from the top because of the magical properties of the building. When Kevin enters the building he is barraged by Red Caps but manages to defeat them swiftly. He is then confronted by what appears to be his dead friends Edsel and Sean. At first he is tricked by their magic, but after Emil Grackleflint happens to finally find and (temporarily) kill the Fisher King, a burst of magical energy is released, and he manages to see through the glamour, realizing that it's actually a Leanhaun Sidhe and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84083\" href=\"/piet-grackleflint/4005-84083/\" slug=\"piet-grackleflint\">Piet</a> Grackleflint. Kevin defeats them and moves on into the next room. Here he discovers the lair of the elder dragon Cromm Cruich. After a couple of meaningless blows and guards he lets the dragon eat him and tears it apart from the inside. After the dragon Kevin meets a giant who insists on unarmed wrestling. Kevin throws aside his bat and flips the giant down into the bottomless pit, ending the contest quickly. He then walks out onto the Pit platform and uses his strength to scale the wall. During his climb, shadows of dead people Kevin feels responsible for, with bodies of his pet dog he killed, criticize him, but he overcomes his guilt, destroying the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84087\" href=\"/master-of-the-hunt/4005-84087/\" slug=\"master-of-the-hunt\">shadows</a>. Kevin finally makes it to the Umbra Sprite's chamber only to find him dead, a victim of Emil Grackleflint's wrath. Kevin exits the building and he and Mirth leave town in Edsel's car, ready to track down the evils that escaped the fall of the Styx Casino.</p>",

They also find that several of their fellow <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59192\" href=\"/avatars/4060-59192/\" slug=\"avatars\">avatars</a> have come to the city, but unfortunately they are fighting amongst themselves as much as they fight the enemy. Kevin tries to establish some leadership among the group, but many of them prefer to be independent. In fact, even Kirby, one of Kevin's closest allies, is unhappy with Kevin's attempts to be the leader. One of the few who unquestionably follows Kevin, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23746\" href=\"/the-hornblower/4005-23746/\" slug=\"the-hornblower\">Hornblower</a>, is kind of annoying, so Kevin brusquely sends him off on a wild goose chase, where he is killed. Kevin has come to a point where he is simultaneously feeling guilty over everything he does, and feeling totally cocky and arrogant about who he is, and those two traits are working against him. He fights his fellow avatar the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23749\" href=\"/the-dragonslayer/4005-23749/\" slug=\"the-dragonslayer\">Dragonslayer</a> against his better judgement, and while he beats him, his Bat (a disguised <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55696\" href=\"/excalibur/4055-55696/\" slug=\"excalibur\">Excalibur</a>) burns his hands for using it for the wrong reasons.</p><p>There are further complications as Wally Ut shows back up, still proclaiming his status as the second Mage and giving insane-sounding advice, and as Isis comes to visit along with her sisters <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84251\" href=\"/magda/4005-84251/\" slug=\"magda\">Magda</a> and Ishtar. Kevin is said to be fated to fall in love with Magda, a fate he had tried to avoid. However, he instantly falls for her when he sees her. It seems to feeling is mutual. However, it is unclear whether it is true love or a magic enchantment, for he frequently seems to be completely hypnotized at the thought of her. Also, Joe is secretly ensnared by a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59160\" href=\"/leanhaun-sidhe/4060-59160/\" slug=\"leanhaun-sidhe\">Leanhaun Sidhe</a>, a succubus, who takes over his mind and drains his energy, unknown to the others. Finally, Kirby keeps leaving and coming back unexpectedly as he tries to complete his own set of labors.</p><p>Slowly the heroes manage to find out where the source of evil is coming from--the giant cross on Mount Royal. They also learn that Emil is behind it all. The succubus kidnaps Joe, and Kirby, Kevin, and their new ally the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84250\" href=\"/the-presbyter/4005-84250/\" slug=\"the-presbyter\">Presbyter</a> go after him, up at the cross. They find that the cross hides a passageway down into Emil's faerie realms. The Presbyter is soon lost, but the heroes rescue Joe and even find Wally Ut. They finally get to an arena where Emil and his golem are waiting. Kirby thinks that killing the golem is one of his labors and is angry that Kevin won't back off. Eventually due to a mistake of Kevin's, the golem gets even more power and kills Kirby. Kevin manages to resurrect him but destroys the Bat in the process. Wally Ut, meanwhile, turns out to actually be the second mage after all, and defeats Emil. Emil is tricky, however, and escapes, only to be banished by his father, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84076\" href=\"/umbra-sprite/4005-84076/\" slug=\"umbra-sprite\">Umbra Sprite</a>. Kevin and Wally run out, but Wally is lost. At the end, Kevin finds Magda and asks her to marry him.</p><h3>Characteristics</h3><p>Artistically, the <i>Hero Defined</i> is quite different from <i>The Hero Discovered</i> in many ways. The <i>Hero Discovered</i> uses watercolor and airbrush for colors, along with a very precise ink line and large solid black areas. It has a very graphic look. <i>The Hero Defined</i> drawn in a much looser, sketchier, more cartooney way. Its colors are done in a more standard, early-computer-coloring style.</p><p>In terms of writing, one major difference is that while <i>The</i> <i>Hero Discovered</i> was semi-autobiographical, with Kevin Matchstick based on <a data-ref-id=\"4040-8310\" href=\"/matt-wagner/4040-8310/\" slug=\"matt-wagner\">Matt Wagner</a>, the rest of the characters seem to be purely fictional. In <i>The Hero Defined</i>, on the other hand, many of the characters are explicitly based on Wagner's acquaintances. These include: Joe Phat is <a data-ref-id=\"4040-20329\" href=\"/joe-matt/4040-20329/\" slug=\"joe-matt\">Joe Matt</a>, Kirby Hero is <a data-ref-id=\"4040-49879\" href=\"/bernie-mireault/4040-49879/\" slug=\"bernie-mireault\">Bernie Mireault</a>, The Dragonslayer is <a data-ref-id=\"4040-50668\" href=\"/dave-sim/4040-50668/\" slug=\"dave-sim\">Dave Sim</a>, the Ulster Hound is <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore</a>, Isis is <a data-ref-id=\"4040-26890\" href=\"/diana-schutz/4040-26890/\" slug=\"diana-schutz\">Diana Schutz</a>, Bartholomew Gretch is <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41760\" href=\"/bob-schreck/4040-41760/\" slug=\"bob-schreck\">Bob Schreck</a>, John J. Strider the Xth is <a data-ref-id=\"4040-2585\" href=\"/john-k-snyder-iii/4040-2585/\" slug=\"john-k-snyder-iii\">John K. Snyder the III</a>, and Magda is Wagner's real wife, Barbara Schutz (sister of Diana).</p>",
