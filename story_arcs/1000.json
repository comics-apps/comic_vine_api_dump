    "deck": "The Cold War is over and Nick Fury finds himself lost in the world.  That is until an old foe shows up and tries to throw the world into chaos.  ",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>Nick Fury is a washed out secret agent in a world of bureaucracy. He is a man of war in a peaceful world. But when a former enemy - who is now something like a close personal acquaintance of Nick's - instigates a war on a small island, Nick leaps back into action and goes back to war. With a small team of special forces from all around the world, Nick Fury invades the island and takes it back. However, the two men of war who have become spearheads of their respective factions discover that the are just that: Men of war. Ultimately, Fury is led to the shocking discovery that his old adversary was right when he said that if he hadn't started the war, Fury would have done it.</p><h2>Synopsis</h2><p>Colonel Nick Fury is an aging cold war veteran that has lost his place in the world. With the cold war over Nick Fury doesn't see the action he used to see and has to go to other agencies to see any action since SHIELD offers him none. Budgetary restraints, his rank, and insiders wanting to dismantle SHIELD have made the organization all but useless. Nick Fury misses the gold old days of saving the world, constantly sleeping with new hot women without paying them, and the ever present danger of the world going to hell. Moping Nick Fury meets an old cold war nemesis at a bar and they talk about the good old days and gripe about how the world turned out, when out of the blue Colonel Gagarin tells Fury that he wants to start a new cold war so they would have something to do which Fury declines.</p><p>When Fury visits his old friend Dugan he finds out that Gagarin decided to go ahead and try and start a new cold war by overthrowing the government of Napoleon Island which lies in between the mainland United States and Hawaii. Gagarin even goes as far as to have assassins try to kill Fury so they can redo their cold war game. After surviving the attack Nick heads to SHIELD to build his team to take down Gagarin while Gagarin is taking greater control of the island turning its’ current leader into an unwilling puppet without his knowing. When Nick Fury and his team arrive and start taking out the islands military Gagarin is overwhelmed with joy that he hasn't known in years.</p><p>Gagarin gains complete control of the island and has the U.S. believing that the nation is now a communist country and the U.S. is getting ready to bomb the island. Fury trying to stop that from happening captures the island's puppet leader and tries to get a video broadcast showing him exposing Gagarin as a rogue agent hoping that the U.S. will call off the bomb strikes. Gagarin ends up killing the island's former leader which causes the U.S. to bomb the island. Gagarin is howling with pure joy at the slaughter the bombers are bringing to the island loving every second of it taking him back to the good old days. Nick Fury is outraged and attacks and ultimately kills Gagarin. Later on back in the U.S. Nick Fury ponders what Gagarin did and why he didn't stop him when he talked about starting a new cold war and wonders if he didn't because he wanted Gagarin to start a new cold war so he would have something to do.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Story</h2><p>Some time later, it was revealed that Banner had once again been captured. When Doc Samson and She-Hulk took a reluctant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4799\" href=\"/ben-urich/4005-4799/\" slug=\"ben-urich\">Ben Urich</a> and Peter Parker into a false military base to serve as witnesses, they saw a traitorous General Ross working side-by-side with MODOK and Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.) in developing some sort of gamma super soldier program. They also saw Bruce, unconscious, in a liquid suspension pod, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\" href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" slug=\"rick-jones\">A-Bomb</a>, strapped to a table, about to be experimented on.</p><p>Before they could decide what to do about this startling revelation, Doc Samson suddenly underwent a transformation as a result of an earlier modification experiment conducted on him (by MODOK and the Leader) and he became a more violent, evil version who only referred to himself as 'Samson'. She-Hulk and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4315\" href=\"/doc-samson/4005-4315/\" slug=\"doc-samson\">Samson</a> fought, revealing their presence to M.O.D.O.K. and Gen. Ross. Ben decided that it was best for he and Peter to escape, but the Red Hulk appeared from out of nowhere. He reached for Ben, but Peter, now dressed as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\">Spider-Man</a>, distracted him and tried to battle both the Red Hulk and M.O.D.O.K.</p><p>Spider-Man was surprised when the Red Hulk was able to burn his webbing from his face, allowing him to gain the upper hand against the wall-crawler. The battle has awakened Banner, and seeing Spider-Man in trouble, he transformed into the Hulk and intervened. Eventually, the Red Hulk got frustrated at the constant battling with the Hulk and he manifested a previously unrevealed ability to drain energy. He drained the Hulk's power until he turned back into Banner, declaring that he didn't deserve to be the Hulk. He also claimed that Banner would never be able to transform into the Hulk again. Due to an impending gamma core meltdown, Red Hulk and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\" href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" slug=\"modok\">M.O.D.O.K</a>. escaped. Now awake, A-Bomb shielded Banner from the explosion. Ben and Peter escaped virtually unharmed. Ben was later prevented from writing the story when the Red Hulk threatened him with the lives of everyone at Front Line.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Banner was contemplating on what to do with his life now that he seemingly could not become the Hulk anymore. He thought on whether or not the Hulk side of him was really dead. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\" href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" slug=\"norman-osborn\">Norman Osborn</a> heard of what happened to Banner, he sent Ares to confirm that a \"major player\" had been removed from the field. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11940\" href=\"/ares/4005-11940/\" slug=\"ares\">Ares</a> caught Banner talking to A-Bomb in his old vault, where they used to imprison the Hulk during the time when he had involuntary nighttime transformations. Ares harassed Banner, trying to see if he could cause him to transform. A-Bomb, now with Rick's personality being completely dominant, tried to defend his friend, but Ares eventually got him in a vulnerable position. Ares then threatened to cut off <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\" href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" slug=\"rick-jones\">A-Bomb</a>'s head if Banner didn't manifest the Hulk. Still unable to transform, Banner taunted Ares, and tricked him into the Hulk-proof vault, which Banner then sealed. Being significantly weaker than the Hulk, Ares was unable to escape until the timer released him in the morning. Meanwhile, Banner bid goodbye to Rick and took a bus to places unknown.</p><p>Banner, now unable to transform into the Hulk, decided that he must locate his son and train/tame him. Banner believed that sooner or later, the Hulk would find a way to manifest again, and when this happened, Skaar stood the only chance of stopping him. Banner lured Skaar to his location with a gamma-absorbing armored suit which Skaar homed in on and attacked, thinking that it was indeed the Hulk.</p><p>Skaar soon found out that Banner had lured him in and used his Old-Power to disable/destroy the armor. Banner then convinced him that if Skaar ever wanted a shot at the Hulk he'd need to be trained by Banner. Banner accomplished this by pitting Skaar against some heavy hitters in the Marvel Universe... first being the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\" href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" slug=\"juggernaut\">Juggernaut</a>. Banner destroyed a trailer where the Juggernaut was staying - inciting a brief fight with Skaar and Juggernaut. After learning a direct attack was useless, Skaar ended up sending Juggernaut into orbit. The two quickly discovered that the X-Men, who had been monitoring The Juggernaut, were not pleased by this turn of events.</p><p>Wolverine soon found Skaar and Banner in a comic shop, reading old Conan comics. Skaar made quick work of Wolverine and picked up the scent of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\" href=\"/daken/4005-42501/\" slug=\"daken\">Daken</a>. Banner (who had created an Old-Power taser) gave several blasts to Wolverine to keep him off of his son's trail temporarily. After a rather brief encounter with Daken and after nearly being killed, Skaar was saved by Banner, just as Daken was about to make the killing stroke. The pairs parted ways with Banner supporting wounded Skaar and Daken supporting a beaten Wolverine.</p><p>Bruce Banner, a member of Norman Osborn's 'List', was soon seen rescuing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31645\" href=\"/kate-waynesboro/4005-31645/\" slug=\"kate-waynesboro\">Kate Waynesboro</a> from an Old-Power harvesting factory under the control of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59261\" href=\"/victoria-hand/4005-59261/\" slug=\"victoria-hand\">Victoria Hand</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\" href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" slug=\"norman-osborn\">Norman Osborn</a>. Using 'Banner-tech' devices Bruce easily overpowered the security systems and brought in Skaar to take out the armored guards keeping Waynesboro in custody. After the three escaped the factory they headed to what Banner believed to be another Old-Power facility, in order to destroy it. They ran into the Dark Ms. Marvel and Victoria Hand who'd been sent to intercept them. The four fought, with Ms. Marvel taking on Skaar and Hand taking on Banner. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\" href=\"/moonstone/4005-3279/\" slug=\"moonstone\">Ms. Marvel</a> made a whispered deal with Skaar who grabbed Banner and retreated with him into the distance. Skaar revealed what Ms. Marvel had told him: The facility that Banner had just sabotaged was a <i>gamma</i> plant, and Osborn had secretly exposed Banner to immense gamma radiation... which was quickly bonding to his cellular structure again... hastening the re-emergence of the Hulk.</p>",

Vader wants him to pose as one of Jabba's henchman and makes sure to capture Skywalker and bring him in.</p><p>Later, both Luke and Leia received contact from <a href=\"/lando-calrissian/4005-6355/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6355\"> Lando Calrissian</a>, that Boba Fett is on the planet, Gall with the help of the bounty hunter, <a href=\"/dash-rendar/4005-51595/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51595\"> Dash Rendar</a>. The group comes up with a plan consisting of Luke leading Rogue Squadron to cause a distraction above the planet, alerting the Imperials station there, while Render leads Lando, <a href=\"/princess-leia/4005-33545/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33545\"> Leia</a>, and <a href=\"/chewbacca/4005-6334/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6334\"> Chewbacca</a> to Boba Fett's location.

Fett refuses, and shoots a sniper that was placed to shoot him. Fett then realizes that Bossk and Zuckuss were distractions and that other bounty hunters were breaking into his ship to steal Han.</p><p>As Luke and Rouge Squadron carry out the plan, Lando Leia and Chewbacca follow Dash in his <a href=\"/outrider/4055-56098/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56098\"> Outrider</a> with the <a href=\"/the-millennium-falcon/4055-52781/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-52781\"> Millennium Falcon</a>, but as they reach the spaceport where Boba's ship is located, tie fighters appear. Dash abandons the group stating that he wasn't paid to shoot, leaving them to deal with the tie fighters. Meanwhile, Luke and Rouge Squadron are forced to withdraw as Imperials reinforcements arrive. When Luke begins to make the jump to lightspeed, <a href=\"/wes-janson/4005-25646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25646\"> Wes Janson</a> fires at Luke's X-wing due to his R2 unit taking control of his ship. Thanks to the <a href=\"/the-force/4015-50253/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\"> Force</a>, Luke was able to destroy Janson's R2 unit without damaging the ship. After Boba Fett takes care of the intruders in his ship, he immediately takes off. Leia and the group are forced to retreat as well as the Falcon suffered damage.</p><p>Back at the Rebel's base, the group finds out that someone paid the technician to program Janson's R2 unit to kill Luke. In order to find out who wants to kill Luke, Leia decides to make contact with the Black Sun leader, Xizor unaware that he is responsible for wanting Luke dead. Leia then tells Luke to lay low on Tatooine.</p><p>On Tatooine, Jix makes contact with Jabba the Hutt's swoop gang and meets their leader, <a href=\"/big-gizz/4005-6412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6412\"> Big Gizz</a> after taking Gizz partner, <a href=\"/spiker/4005-6413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6413\"> Spiker's</a> swoop bike. Impressed by his skills, Gizz takes Jix to Jabba to become part of the gang. While at Jabba's Palace, Jabba informs the gang that Luke Skywalker is on Tatooine and gives the order to kill him due to Xizor's command. Meanwhile at <a href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\"> Obi-Wan Kenobi's</a> hut, Luke finished building a new <a href=\"/lightsaber/4055-44097/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\"> lightsaber</a> thanks to a book Kenobi had. As he pondered on how to test it out, Big Gizz and his swoop gang attack him. Luke steals one of swoop gang's bike and heads straight for Begger's Canyon to loose them. Spiker gets a clear shot to shoot Luke, but Jix rams his swoop bike causing a collision between him, Spiker, and Gizz. Just when Luke reaches a dead end, Dash Rendar comes from behind causing the other swoop gang to retreat. Rendar explains to Luke that he was hired by Leia for protection. The two head back to Obi-Wan's hut. Jix, breaking his leg during the collision notice Luke and Dash riding away, when Gizz walks up wounded from the crash. He figures who Jix really is and gets ready to shoot at Luke, when Jix bashes him over the head with a rock leaving him for dead.</p><p>Meanwhile, Boba Fett is hiding in an asteroid field in order to plan his next move to bring Han to Jabba. Down in Fett's cargo hold, <a href=\"/4-lom/4005-47929/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47929\"> 4-LOM</a>, a droid that Boba apparently destroyed when he was trying to steal Han on Gall, reactivates and sends a signal to Bossk and Zuckuss of Fett's location.

One of Bossk's men, <a href=\"/furlag/4005-52587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52587\"> Furlag </a>leads Boba to his own holding cell, but Fett activates a trap door underneath him. Fett then takes out all the bounty hunters on his ship except Zuckuss keeping him alive so he can distract Bossk on the comlink. Boba plants a bomb in Bossk's transport ship and as the ship reaches Bossk's ship it explodes, giving Boba a chance to escape.</p><p>Later, the Emperor, along with Xizor witness Luke Skywalker and <a href=\"/bothans/4060-56723/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56723\"> Bothan</a> technicians steal the plans for the Second Death Star hoping to set a trap for him.

Luke held them off giving the Bothans time to escape, but gets captured instead. He then learns about the two bounties on his head: Alive for Darth Vader, dead from Xizor.</p><p>Leia and Chewie are aboard Guri's starfighter the Stinger preparing for the trip to <a href=\"/coruscant/4020-48936/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-48936\"> Coruscant</a> to meet with Xizor. In order to hide themselves, the two poses as bounty hunters. As they made their way underneath Coruscant, they are greeted by Xizor. He then invites Leia for dinner at his private chambers where he tries to seduce her. Thanks to Chewie's interruption, Leia realizes what he is doing to her and distracts him while Chewie escapes to get help. However, Xizor planned for this an intentionally allowed him to escape so he could bring Skywalker.</p><p>Meanwhile, Luke manages to escape his captives thanks to his Jedi training and with both <a href=\"/r2-d2/4005-2594/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2594\"> R2-D2</a> and Lando and make their escape before Vader arrives.

Vader concludes that it was Xizor trying to set him up and heads straight to Coruscant.</p><p>Luke and his friends managed to sneak in Xizor palace and rescue Leia. The group then confronts Xizor and his guards resulting in a battle. In order to make their escape, Lando threatens Xizor with thermal detonators, stopping the battle after dropping a few in the garbage chute.

Wanting to find her, Bruce finds out that Dawn has been accompanying herself with Gotham's Underworld. Bent on protecting her from the insane criminals, Batman begins to start with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3725\" href=\"/killer-croc/4005-3725/\" slug=\"killer-croc\">Killer Croc</a> which leads to him battling <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4885\" href=\"/penguin/4005-4885/\" slug=\"penguin\">Penguin</a>. The two criminals were working together to sell Dawn as a prostitute. Penguin's intentions to kill both, Dawn and Batman, failed when Killer Croc decided he didn't want to die in the Penguin's bombing. Batman saved Dawn and eventually rekindles with his childhood friend. During this time, the monsters (i.e. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4846\" href=\"/ragman/4005-4846/\" slug=\"ragman\">Ragman</a>) and demons (i.e. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7367\" href=\"/etrigan-the-demon/4005-7367/\" slug=\"etrigan-the-demon\">Etrigan</a>) that operate in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\" href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" slug=\"gotham-city\">Gotham</a> are being controlled by an unknown force.   <br/><h2>Full Plot</h2>Bruce has a flashback of the first time he met Dawn Golden, he remembers her a sullen and aloof child, always being watched by her father. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3602\" href=\"/thomas-wayne/4005-3602/\" slug=\"thomas-wayne\">Thomas Wayne</a> suggested that Bruce and Dawn play outside while he talked with her father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75100\" href=\"/aleister-golden/4005-75100/\" slug=\"aleister-golden\">Aleister</a>. While Aleister was reluctant to let her daughter go outside, Thomas convinced him that she needs fresh air. When Bruce began to play with his kite that his parents gave him, Dawn took it from him and let it blow away in the wind. Bruce was enraged and tried to attack Dawn, but eventually the two fell in love with one another at the same time.  <br/> <br/>In the present, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42090\" href=\"/gotham-city-police-department/4060-42090/\" slug=\"gotham-city-police-department\">GCPD</a> is trying to deal with Dawn missing. A new addition to the team, Lt. Forbes, wants to be on the Dawn Golden Case, however <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\" href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" slug=\"james-gordon\">Jim Gordon</a> wants him on regular street crimes in Gotham. Harvey tells Jim that they've scanned Dawn's apartment for clues, but nothing turns up. Batman hears the news of his missing friend, and finds a clue that leads to Killer Croc. He finds out that Croc has been taking street level Venom, and quickly attacks Croc with deadly force. With all of the force, it barely hurts him, the battle eventually leads to Croc being badly wounded.  Batman begins to ask questions about Dawn Golden, and Killer Croc tells him that Lars Beck took Ms. Golden.  <br/> <br/>Later, Jim meets with Batman and talks about the mysterious Lars Beck. Through police records, Lars Beck was a smalltime crook in Gotham City. He was eventually killed by an unknown person (revealed to be the Penguin) and thrown into Gotham Bay. <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1911687-tdk01_032_033.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1911687\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1911687-tdk01_032_033.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1911687\"><img alt=\" \"Your Goose Is Cooked\"\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1911687-tdk01_032_033.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1911687-tdk01_032_033.jpg 2560w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/1911687-tdk01_032_033.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1911687-tdk01_032_033.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption> \"Your Goose Is Cooked\"</figcaption></figure>    In the narrows, the homeless guys were talking about missing members to their gang. They were discussing that they should always stick together, or else they'll turn up dead like the rest of their gang. When another homeless man was screaming, the three members found out that he was brutally murdered. Batman is talking with Alfred about Dawn Golden in the batcave and also looking more into Lars Beck. While they search for more information, Bruce eventually leaves to the last known location of the late Mr. Beck. Using his x-ray vision built into his cowl, Batman finds out that Dawn Golden's necklace is in the position of -- the Penguin! Penguin tells his men to shoot Batman, with quick thinking Batman trips them up in a line of wire. <br/> <br/>Batman interrogates Penguin by breaking his arm and leg, but before he gave anything out to Batman, Killer Croc is revealed to have been working with Penguin all along. The two leave with Batman as their hostage. Outside, a mysterious woman is stealing the batmobile with some unusual technology. In Jason Blood's home, he is witnessing many mystical signs all at once, so he takes it upon himself to kill those who oppose the order of things. Saying his rhyme, he switches to Etrigan to hunt down the threat of all mystical beings. Meanwhile, Batman is strapped to bomb which is triggered by his heart rate, and is chained up in an abandoned train station with Killer Croc watching him. Back in the narrows, Ragman is seen as the threat to the homeless guys and is badly wounded by Etrigan. While Etrigan was protecting the homeless man at first, he killed him in an instant. With the bomb strapped to Batman about to blow, he quickly dislocates his arm and finds Dawn needing much care. He arrives to find his batmobile parked right outside of the train station and sees a young woman running away from the car, Batman and Dawn don't talk and they drive to a safe location. In the hospital, Penguin is seen working with Ragman at trying to open the gates of hell. ",

Meanwhile at the Atlantic Spaceport a mysterious woman calling herself Ms Torsen enters the city. At the Hiroshima Hotel she is given a gun and heads to an undertakers called Dead Easy. Here she meets some Sov sleeper agents and reveals her name is Nadia. When one of the agents says he has a girlfreind living in Mega City One Nadia breaks his neck and orders the others to take care of the girl.</span></p><p>Dredd it teaching a class on attitude at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56250\" href=\"/academy-of-law/4020-56250/\" slug=\"academy-of-law\">Academy of Law</a> and after Psi Cadet Hennessy tells him that she sees death and destruction on election day but can’t see more. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30061\" href=\"/judge-dredd/4005-30061/\" slug=\"judge-dredd\">Dredd</a> tells her to focus on why it is happening and to contact him if she gets anything more. Soon after Hennessy gets a vision of the agents killing the girlfriend, called Treena, and alerts Dredd of this. They try to find Treena’s location but Hennessy can only an image of her face.</p><p>The Judges cross reference a picture drawn by Cadet Hennessy and the name Treena with the Justice Department’s Central Database to find her apartment. When the Judges arrive they find her already dead and after some investigating they decide to investigate Treena’s boyfriend Billy, who was the sleeper agent that Nadia killed. Going off of one of Hennessy’s psi flashes they find Billy’s corpse in a chem pit. Dredd gets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6066\" href=\"/judge-roffman/4005-6066/\" slug=\"judge-roffman\">PSU Judge Roffman</a> to do a background check on Billy to find out his movements before his death..</p><p>The Sov agents kidnap Former Deputy Civilian Director of Mega City One’s Bio-Warfare Research Facility, a Elmore Yurges. They take him and his family to Dead Easy and put them in coffins to be smuggled out of the city. Using information found by Judge Roffman, Dredd gets ninety Judges to do a sweep of the last known location of Billy. One of the Judges, Elliott, enters the Dead Easy and is killed by an undercover Sov agent masquerading as a Judge.</p><p>The Judge escorts the van holding the Yurges family out of the city, but Nadia stays behind to burn down the Dead Easy and takes to the roof of a nearby building with a rifle. When Dredd arrives she takes a shot at him but hits a Judge who is driving by on his Lawmaster. The other Judges on site fire at her with Heatseakers and she falls off of the roof and into the road. When Dredd goes to check that she is dead she springs into life stabs him in the throat, but she is unable to twist the blade before she is shot down by the Judges.</p><p>Two days later Judge Dredd is being debriefed at St. David Icke Hospital. After running a DNA check the Justice Department was able to find out that Nadia was one of the last Superhumans created by East-Meg One before it was nuked at the end of the Apocalypse War. They also found out that the Yurges family has gone missing and are expecting the worse.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In \"<em>The Brainiac Trilogy</em>\" (penned by Roger Stern and George Perez) in <i>Action Comics</i> #647-649, Superman reviews recent events and realizes that Luthor and Brainiac must be working together. Brainiac, who seems to have some mental connection to Superman, knows that Superman is aware of him. He acts quickly, taking mental control over Luthor's aide, Happersen, and eventually the other LexCorp employees. He uses mechanical devices to strengthen his control.</p><p>In <i>Action Comics</i> #649, Brainiac tells Luthor that he worked for the Computer Tyrants on his home planet, Colu. When he failed them, his body was disintegrated. Somehow, his mind survived and was drawn across space to the brain of Milton Moses Fine.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brainiac's body is submerged in a biochemical bath while it is treated with recombinant DNA and bionic enhancements. Superman arrives just as Brainiac emerges from the tank, now green skinned, with a fit, trim and muscular body. His mustache and beard are yellow, and he has metallic devices attached to his skull and back.</p><p>Brainiac launches a mental attack on Superman, but once again is defeated by the power of Superman's mind. Brainiac manages to escape in a star-ship (later called his \"head-ship\"), designed as a robotic face. He promises to return, and Superman promises to be waiting for him.</p>",

He named the child America Beeny after her mother. Five years later Bennett’s body is starting to degrade and he is dieing.</span></p><p>One day a music critic called Victor Portnoy arrives at Bennett’s house and tells him that he is going to win an Arnie award for a song he wrote, at the event Bennett will be the catalyst for an assassination.</p><p>The Judge’s routine surveillance of the Beeny household alerts Dredd that Portnoy has visited. Dredd has a Judge put on surveillance of Bennett while he is hospital for treatment of spasms he has. One night Bennett gets up and walks out of the hospital and is attacked and raped by a gang. The Judge on surveillance stands by and waits before he breaks them up, for this he is suspended and charged with criminal neglect of duty.</p><p>Soon after a hairdresser droid comes to Bennett and gives him a broach of the Statue of Liberty’s torch, which had been demolished by the Judges by this point. The broach will explode when he goes to make his acceptance speech. Dredd makes a house call and tells Bennett that he is mixing with the wrong people, meaning Portnoy, and it would be good if he stopped.</p><p>Bennett and his daughter mark the anniversary of America’s passing by visiting the remains of the Statue of Liberty and when he returns he tries to write a goodbye letter to her. The morning of the Arnies Portnoy visits Bennett and tells him if he tries to back the remnants of Total War will kill America Beeny.</p><p>At the Arnies The Judges are on standby, Portnoy leaves as Bennett starts to walk to the stage. Dredd grabs Portnoy and reveals that Bennett told them of the plan, he gets America’s position just as Total War agents reveal themselves and start shooting. Judges swarm in and gun down the Total War members but it is too late to stop a bloodbath.</p><p>America is reunited with her father and he hugs her goodbye one last time before he goes to the hospital to be euthanized. America is enrolled in the Academy of Justice because Bennett believed that if she lived outside of the Judges Total War would use her. He believed that if America was part of the Judges she would work to change the Judges from the inside.</p><h2>Cadet</h2><p>Writer: <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41829\" href=\"/john-wagner/4040-41829/\" slug=\"john-wagner\">John Wagner</a>, Artist: <a data-ref-id=\"4040-8835\" href=\"/colin-macneil/4040-8835/\" slug=\"colin-macneil\">Colin MacNeil</a>, Colours: <a data-ref-id=\"4040-1270\" href=\"/chris-blythe/4040-1270/\" slug=\"chris-blythe\">Chris Blythe</a>, Letters: <a data-ref-id=\"4040-53014\" href=\"/annie-halfacree-parkhouse/4040-53014/\" slug=\"annie-halfacree-parkhouse\">Annie Parkhouse</a></p>",

We see <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1493\" href=\"/moon-knight/4005-1493/\" slug=\"moon-knight\">Moon Knight</a>, in his prime, viciously beating up rival gangsters. After disabling all of them, he leaves in the Mooncopter, piloted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27829\" href=\"/frenchie/4005-27829/\" slug=\"frenchie\">Frenchie</a>, and returns home to make love to his girlfriend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-33191\" href=\"/marlene-alraune/4005-33191/\" slug=\"marlene-alraune\">Marlene</a>. There is a short sequence here that shows Moon Knight repeating this process every night. Finally, the scene cuts to the present, to the current Marc Spector - a broken, pill-addicted cripple surrounded by bottles of booze and living in filth. As he struggles to take a painkiller, more flashbacks are shown to when Moon Knight was first crippled. How all his friends abandoned him, how he physically abused Marlene, and how he lost all of his fortune. In the present, as his painkiller rolls towards a statue draped with a cover, he kneels by it and pulls it aside, revealing a statue of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42387\" href=\"/khonshu/4005-42387/\" slug=\"khonshu\">Khonshu</a>. His final words in the narration are: \"But please, let me be a hero again.\"</p><h3>Part Two: Fear More Than God</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859727-picture2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859727\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3929866989117\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859727-picture2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859727\"><img alt=\"Moon Knight vs. Bushman\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859727-picture2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859727-picture2.jpg 827w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859727-picture2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Moon Knight vs. Bushman</figcaption></figure><p>Spector sits on the ground and pulls up his pants, revealing the brutal scars on his knees. He flashes back to the fight that crippled him - the final fight with his nemesis, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-33235\" href=\"/bushman/4005-33235/\" slug=\"bushman\">Raoul Bushman</a>. It's a bloody, vicious fight on the rooftops that ends in tragedy when Moon Knight gets pushed off the side by Bushman. Falling down, he slams repeatedly onto the sides of buildings before landing feet-first onto the earth. His legs are a bloody twisted mess when he finally hits the ground. Bushman drops down beside Moon Knight, approaching him for the kill, but Spector quickly throws multiple moon darts out. They impale themselves on Bushman's neck, but as he falls down beside Moon Knight, he manages to sink his teeth into the hero's face before Moon Knight can punch him off. In his final act as Moon Knight, Spector uses one of his moon darts as a carving knife and skins Bushman's face. He holds the skinned face of his nemesis to the Moon and calls out Khonshu's name.</p><p>Back in the present, someone flicks a cigarette onto the street, but a passerby picks it up. The passerby is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-34561\" href=\"/crawley/4005-34561/\" slug=\"crawley\">Crawley</a>, one of Moon Knight's old associates, and he begins smoking the discarded cigarette. Crawley stops by at a pharmacy to collect Spector's prescriptions. Back in Marc Spector's home, his butler <a data-ref-id=\"4005-35697\" href=\"/samuels/4005-35697/\" slug=\"samuels\">Samuels</a> steps into the room and asks if he's alright. Samuels then helps Marc back up to his wheelchair just as Crawley arrives. Samuels offers to make Crawley some tea, but Spector tells Samuels that he's not staying. Crawley starts calling Marc by one of his old identities, Jake, and Marc tells him not to do that. As Crawley speaks, we see the eyes of the Khonshu statue glowing for a brief moment. After giving Marc his medication, Crawley mentions that Frenchie wants to meet with Spector. Marc seems genuinely surprised, and calls for Samuels to get the car ready for lunch. He puts aside his painkillers.</p><p>In an unknown location somewhere, a young man named Donnie enters the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45550\" href=\"/the-profile/4005-45550/\" slug=\"the-profile\">Profile</a>'s office and tells him that Asset Prime is moving. As the Profile stares at the man, the reader can see his point of view, analyzing every aspect of the man.</p><h3>Part Three: To the Bone</h3><p>As Marc Spector arrives at Frenchie's restaurant, a briefing on Marc Spector's past is also being held in the unknown location. Donnie is giving the presentation, detailing Spector's history in the Marine Corps until his dishonorable discharge in '87, before he is interrupted by the Profile. The Profile then takes over while berating Donnie for not cutting to the chase, and goes straight to Spector's time as a mercenary in the desert.</p><p>At Frenchie's restaurant, Marc meets Jean-Paul. Marc is using a cane while Jean-Paul's feet have been replaced by prosthetics, and the two comment that they should sit down before they fall over. Jean-Paul's partner, Rob, comes over and despite Marc's protests, Jean-Paul orders some food for him. Back at the unknown location, the Profile explains that in '89, Marc had already associated himself with two other mercenaries - Jean-Paul Duchamp and Raoul Bushman. In '91 they were cleaning up some loose ends post-Desert Storm, but occasionally indulged in some personal business. One such instance of this was in the Valley of the Kings, in the Tomb of King Sety II. Excavation of the newly-discovered chambers were being undertaken by Dr. Peter Alraune Senior and his daughter Marlene, and the three mercenaries had planned on ransacking the tomb. Chaos ensued, and Dr. Alraune was killed while Bushman and Spector fight over whether or not to kill Marlene. The Profile then states that Bushman successfully kills Spector.</p><p>Back at Frenchie's, Jean-Paul reveals that Rob is not his business partner, but rather his life partner. Marc is shocked, and asks Frenchie about all those women, and Frenchie replies that most of those were beards. Marc then says that Frenchie should have told him, but Jean-Paul replied that he did every day. Each time that he risked his life for Marc and his cause, each time he told Marc that he loved him. Marc then asks if anyone else knew, and Jean-Paul replies that Marlene did. Marc then gets angry, asking if this is why Frenchie called for him, but Jean-Paul replies that he didn't call Marc here. In the Profile's briefing, he notes that this is where things get unusual. Where something blurs Marc Spector's outline and obscures his profile. In the tomb of Sety II, Khonshu - the Egyptian god of the moon and vengeance - resurrects Marc as his avatar on Earth. The Profile then goes on to state that Khonshu has already resurrected Spector twice.</p><p>Back at Frenchie's, Marc realizes that Crawley set them up. He gets angry at Frenchie and storms off. In the Profile's briefing, he notes that after his resurrection, Spector began developing multiple identities: the billionaire Steven Grant, the cab driver Jake Lockley, and the hero Moon Knight. All of these personalities served Khonshu, and the Profile states that this was the reason why the Committee failed to recruit Moon Knight. The Profile then goes on to say that Moon Knight has since fallen out of his prime, and Khonshu's influence has waned. He then states that Spector is searching for a reason to live, and if they (the New Committee) want to recruit him, they need a long-term strategy. He needs to be isolated from his remaining friends, given an injury, and then provided a catalyst (revealing that it was the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57187\" href=\"/the-committee/4060-57187/\" slug=\"the-committee\">New Committee</a> who hired Bushman to cripple Spector).</p><p>As the briefing is going on, we see Frenchie and Rob being attacked by a man in a black tracksuit. The man rips off Frenchie's prosthetic legs and beats him with it. Meanwhile, we see Samuels giving Spector the news about Frenchie and Marc goes to the hospital to visit him. He meets with Rob there to see the bedridden Jean-Paul, and as he leaves, he sees Marlene as well. Marc then goes off to find the man who assaulted Frenchie, and then proceeds to attakc him. Unsheathing a blade from his cane, he runs it through the man's mouth before repeatedly stabbing him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859729-picture3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859729\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0623441396509\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859729-picture3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859729\"><img alt=\"Enter: Taskmaster\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859729-picture3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859729-picture3.jpg 802w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859729-picture3.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Enter: Taskmaster\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859729-picture3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859729-picture3.jpg 802w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859729-picture3.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Enter: Taskmaster</figcaption></figure><p>In the Profile's briefing, Donnie reveals that he has already executed one of the final phase contingencies (the beating of Frenchie). The Profile gets angry, stating that Donnie did that because he thought he would be rewarded for it, and says that because the wrong contingency was executed at the wrong time, Moon Knight now has a reason to live. He states that because the catalyst has been activated, Spector has been reminded of what he loves doing and is 'resurrected' for the third time.</p><p>The head of the Committee suddenly calls for 'Contingency T' and two pens shoot out of nowhere, stabbing Donnie in his eyes and killing him. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4578\" href=\"/taskmaster/4005-4578/\" slug=\"taskmaster\">Taskmaster</a> suddenly appears, revealing that he has been hired by the New Committee, and the Committee head tells him to kill Spector.</p><h3>Part Four: Interest in a Mirror</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859734-picture4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859734\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5575117370892\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859734-picture4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859734\"><img alt=\"Khonshu appears\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859734-picture4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859734-picture4.jpg 852w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859734-picture4.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Khonshu appears\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859734-picture4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859734-picture4.jpg 852w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859734-picture4.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Khonshu appears</figcaption></figure><p>As Spector is knelt down in front of the statue of Khonshu, he prays and begs for his god to 'give him more'. Suddenly, Khonshu appears from behind the statue in human form (as Raoul Bushman with his face skinned off). Marc panics, thinking it's <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13927\" href=\"/morpheus/4005-13927/\" slug=\"morpheus\">Morpheus</a>, and Khonshu switches form into Dr. Alraune with a knife in his neck. Marc reaches for a reolver, thinking that he's gone insane, and Khonshu tries to calm him down - first by putting Bushman's skinned face back on. He then tries Crawley and Jean-Paul, but both fail to calm Spector from putting the gun to his head, until Khonshu switches form to Marlene. Marc finally realizes that it's really his god, and asks Khonshu (who's back to Bushman now) why he left him. Khonshu replies that he never did. Meanwhile, the Profile is seen sleeping with the female stenographer from the earlier briefing, and they discuss Moon Knight. The Profile talks about how no one cares about Moon Knight, except for the New Committee, because their fathers failed to recruit him.</p><p>The Profile then goes on to psychoanalyze Moon Knight, talking about Spector's past. Spector's father was a rabbi, his wife died giving birth to Marc, and so he resented Marc. Marc then proceeds to reject his father's God before leaving, looking for love. As he grows older, Marc realizes that he's good at hurting people. In all of his professions (boxer, soldier, mercenary), he learns that he excels at it and that other people love him for it. Back at Spector's apartment, Marc finally reaffirms his fate with Khonshu, and is able to stand, no longer needing his cane or wheelchair. Khonshu tells him to 'do his work' and 'take vengeance', and he will reward Spector with glories. Suddenly, Marlene appears in the apartment, asking Marc if he's gone mad.</p><p>Marlene starts screaming at him, telling him that police had interrogated Frenchie while he was still bed-ridden, asking about who nearly killed the man who injured him. Marc then replies that he can stand now, prompting Marlene to punch him across the face. Marlene then continues to berate him, calling him selfish. She states that all of his friends sacrificed everything for him and his god, but that the moment it got hard, he quit. Marlene then asks him if he thinks it's a coincidence that Jean-Paul was attacked on the day that he met Marc. Marlene suddenly notices that the statue of Khonshu is no longer covered.</p><p>Without warning, Taskmaster bursts in through the window, armed with a blade and a shield. Marlene charges at him while Marc grabs a knife, but Taskmaster manages to knock Marlene out and dodge the blade. Taskmaster is momentarily impressed by their chemistry, and then goes on to say that he's here to kill Spector.</p><h3>Part Five: Friendless &amp; Alone</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859735-picture5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859735\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0892018779343\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859735-picture5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859735\"><img alt=\"The New Committee Speaks\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859735-picture5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859735-picture5.jpg 852w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859735-picture5.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The New Committee Speaks\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859735-picture5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859735-picture5.jpg 852w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859735-picture5.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The New Committee Speaks</figcaption></figure><p>Taskmaster then goes into a monologue, stating how his business of training other supervillains keeps getting busted, prompting him to take little side-jobs like these. Taskmaster then drags Marc to his television screen, where the New Committee are broadcasting live and talking to Spector. The New Committee then states that they will kill him and anyone he cares for. Taskmaster then proceeds to ready himself to behead Spector, before Marlene suddenly emerges from behind and fires a revolver at Taskmaster. Taskmaster manages to shield himself, and shoots an arrow that lands right in the barrel of Marlene's revolver. Taskmaster then tells Marlene to surrender or he'll pin her to the wall, but while he is distracted, Marc manages to bury a moon dart into Taskmaster's foot. Marlene fires at Taskmaster several more times before he throws his crossbow at her, and then Samuels appears with a blunderbuss, shooting Taskmaster out the window. Taskmaster flees off in a nondescript van.</p><p>As Marlene helps Marc up, Marc tells Samuels to get the car ready and to wake up Nedda (the cleaner). They leave for Long Island to Spector's former mansion and enter Marc's secret headquarters underneath the building. Nedda goes off to find something for them to eat as Marlene attends to Marc's wounds. Marlene then starts using the computers to locate the New Committee through their earlier broadcast, while Samuels refuels one of the Mooncopters. Marc puts on his inner armor and suits up, even though he's weak. Marlene then asks him what his going to do, and Marc - now in his full Moon Knight garb - replies, \"Vengeance\". He then leaves in the Mooncopter.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the New Committee's building, Taskmaster is ranting at the Committee members. Taskmaster states that the Profile was incorrect, and that Moon Knight was neither friendless nor alone. Taskmaster then goes on to rant that personal combat is not his 'thing', and that the Committee told him Moon Knight was a sitting duck. Just as he's talking, Taskmaster suddenly looks out the large windows (that are right behind where the Committee members are sitting), and sees the giant plane that Moon Knight is flying towards the building. He flees. Before the Committee members can react, Moon Knight has slammed his entire plane into the side of the building. Moon Knight exits his plane, entering the building, and prepares to exact vengeance.</p><h3>Part Six: Glories Such As These</h3><p>Taskmaster fires multiple arrows at Moon Knight, but they fail to stop him. As he points his sword at Moon Knight, Spector replies, \"Yes, kill me. See if that works this time.\" This causes Taskmaster to break down and panic, and Moon Knight rips off his mask. Moon Knight then collects the files the Committee were keeping on him and his friends, and leaves. As Moon Knight leaps across the buildings, the Profile spots him and begins vomiting. Moon Knight lands at a park somewhere and Marlene helps him leave.</p><p>A while later, Marc is seen shaving and photos of his Mooncopter crashing into the building can be seen on the floor. Marc then goes off to a museum where Marlene is working, and they have a brief, awkward conversation where Marlene tells him they're no longer together. Marc next meets Jean-Paul and Rob as they test out Frenchie's new prosthetic legs, and they appear to be on good terms. He then sees a business consultant of some sort, who tells Marc that he'll be very rich soon thanks to a capital venture from earlier days. Crawley then comes to see Marc, and Marc profusely apologizes to him and thanks Crawley for sending him to see Frenchie. But Crawley admits that he doesn't remember doing any such thing, and Marc suddenly realizes that it was Khonshu who manipulated Crawley and everything.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859737-picture6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859737\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.87152777777778\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859737-picture6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2859737\"><img alt=\"Khonshu chides Spector\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859737-picture6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859737-picture6.jpg 864w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859737-picture6.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Khonshu chides Spector\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859737-picture6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16715/2859737-picture6.jpg 864w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16715/2859737-picture6.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Khonshu chides Spector</figcaption></figure><p>Later, Marc ignores Khonshu and then proceeds to hammer the statue of his moon god while screaming in anger and rage. Khonshu then seemingly 'kills' Marc for a third time before resurrecting him again. Khonshu then tells him that this was all really Marc's fault - that it was Marc himself who let himself slip and who lost faith in Khonshu. He then states that he was the one who triggered the New Committee, causing Marc to fall into a downward spiral to depend on Khonshu again. He then tells Marc that he's a killer and Marc replies shakily that he's not like Khonshu. Khonshu then opens up a dictionary and flips it to the word 'avatar'. He states that Marc is not like him - rather, he is him.</p><p>The issue ends with Marc attacking the Profile and then meeting with Marlene. Somewhere else, we see blood scattered everywhere and a clock being painted on the floor with blood. We then see a black-gloved fist punching a clock.</p>",
