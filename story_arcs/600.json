    "deck": "Venom has to save reporter from criminals that have kidnapped him. But the Punisher messes in his way and complicates the situation, will Venom save the reporter in time? ",
    "description": "<h2>Plot<br/></h2><h3>A New Mission<br/></h3>In Oakland, California, the gang known as the Jadoo are running rampant in the streets. After taking out a former member who defected, they run down a kid's uncle as they were crossing the street in their stolen car. They turn around to finish him off, but the uncle leads them away from the kid by running into a nearby abandoned building. As the Jadoo pursue, one of them breaks off and tries to call for some help. Finding only a busted payphone, he finds the kid and gets him out of there as his uncle plummets to his death trying to jump across the rooftops.<p>The next day the kid heads down to the tunnels where Eddie Brock resides in a city under San Francisco. He tells him what happened and hands him the note the Jadoo gave him. Brock learns that he's actually a reporter named Gray Russell and he's looking to be saved from killing as part of his initiation into the gang. Venom suits up and takes up the task.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Punisher leaves L.A. for home, but listening to the police band about rising gang violence has him making a detour towards Oakland. There, in the Jadoo's base, Gray reminisces about what got him in this situation. His dad apparently worked for Hydra and operated out of a secret lab located somewhere in the building being used by the Jadoo, which is why he had to join the gang to find it and make a name for himself as a journalist. He arranged for some actors to jump a lone Jadoo member so he could save him and be admitted. Now, he was going to have to kill to become a full member or be killed.</p><p>Venom arrives in Oakland just in time to see Punisher going medieval on gang members in the street. Venom tries to reason with Punisher, telling him about the reporter he's trying to rescue, but Punisher refuses to listen. A fight ensues. Venom, of course, takes Punisher down but is forced to abandon him as his actions against the bangers have caused a gang war in the streets.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Jadoo are gearing up to join in as Gray finds the lab he was searching for. However, he's soon dragged out to the fight by a fellow banger. Punisher's van enters the area and Venom decides to take him down once and for all, only to get a massive dose of ultrasonics from it. Punisher locks him in a building's front gate with the sonics trained on him, weakening him. Meanwhile, his mission is about to be failed. <br/></p><h3>The Birth of Pyre<br/></h3><p>Venom, through sheer force of will, snakes a tendril through the sewers to get inside the battle van and destroy the systems inside. Without the sonics, Venom reforms and takes his revenge out on it before remembering his mission and swinging off to find his innocent.</p><p>While both Venom and Punisher interrogate bangers for their own purposes, time runs out as Gray is forced to take part in a drive-by shooting. Eventually, Venom finds Punisher again and reluctantly projects his symbiote on him to save him from being shot from behind. This places Punisher in Venom's debt, but all Venom wants is the protection of his charge.</p><p>The Jadoos return to their base to regroup and redeploy, but Gray runs to hide inside lab he found. Venom and Punisher close in and storm on the Jadoos' base, prompting Gray to try and use the equipment Hydra was building to create their own super soldier to try and give himself powers as protection against the Punisher. Gray gains microwave energy powers and uses it to blast at Punisher and misses. He has better aim against one of the Jadoo and against Venom when he reveals he's there to save him. Venom was late, and now PYRE was gonna get his revenge. <br/></p><h3>Venom and Punisher vs Pyre<br/></h3><p>Russell, calling himself Pyre, is able to keep Venom at bay and the Punisher is no match for that kind of power. Both manage to retreat; Venom to another section of the warehouse and Punisher to his van. Once there, Punisher patches up his wounded leg and consults his partner Microchip on a way to take Pyre down.</p><p>Meanwhile, Venom keeps his distance as best as he can until Punisher crashes through in his van and hits Pyre with the beam modified with Micro's instructions. Unfortunately, he failed to notice the computer screen alerting him to an error with the beam, making it not stop Pyre but cause things to ignite on fire around him.</p><p>Venom tries one final effort to save Pyre, but realizes he must stop him by slamming a unit hanging above down on his legs. Even still, Venom attempts to rescue him but the fire spreads too quickly and engulfs the area. Venom is forced to flee while Pyre burns. Enraged, Venom seeks to take it out on Punisher but with the arrival of the cops vengeance had to be put on hold. They part ways, leaving the site of Pyre's death...or, was it?</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot<br /></h2><h3>New Bonding<br /></h3>While Venom was suffering from some kind of insanity involving multiple voices (some from the symbiote, some not) in is head, Black Tom Cassidy and the Juggernaut came into town. They had been hired to kidnap someone and it looked like they were going to cross paths with Venom. One night, Eddie was talking with a woman he (and the symbiote) liked when they were confronted by a large man. The man was none other than The Juggeraut!<p>The person he and Black Tom were after was apparently Eddie’s girlfriend. Venom wouldn’t stand for that and he attacked Juggernaut. They fought, and at first Venom got tossed around like nothing. Before long though, it became obvious that Juggernaut wasn’t even phasing him. Venom was laughing and cracking jokes (a lot like his old enemy Spider-Man). This only made Juggernaut angrier, and he pounded Venom through the ground and all the way down to the sewers. When they stopped falling, Venom started hearing the voices again but Juggernaut heard nothing. Juggernaut tossed an unconscious Venom into a pool of red liquid and left him for dead. There was something strange about the liquid, and it started to talk to Venom. On the last page of the issue, they began to bond… <br /> <br /><br /></p><h3>Venom Out of His Mind<br /></h3>                          When Venom awoke he discovered that the weird substance that he had landed in was trying to become one with him. He welcomed it, saying, “Venom has room in his head for more than one creep!” He learned that the creature had its own will, and he mentally forced it to think like he did, making his mission (to protect the innocent) and his mind the dominant one. Venom emerged from the pool drastically changed. He was much bigger, had two more pairs of arms and had several small Venom-like heads on his shoulders.<p>Somewhere else, three beings, Paranoia, Necromancer and Dusk, discussed some sort of secret plan they had for Venom. Paranoia’s job soon became obvious. Her face appeared in Eddie Brock’s dream and the next day, he started acted crazy. A friend of his joked that the president of a certain corporation was evil, and Eddie, believing that the man was <i>actually</i> evil, turned into Venom and went after him. Venom found the corporation offices and watched as a janitor cleaned the president’s room. She sat in his chair and pretended she was him and Venom, seeing thins, decided she was the president and killed her! </p><p>That night he had more crazy dreams about Spider-Man, aliens and insanity. He went over to his girlfriend’s house to talk but things got out of hand. While they were talking, the suit (controlled by the virus he had picked up) forced him to try to have sex with her, and it even started to cover him while he did so. Eddie controlled the suit, but only for a moment. It came back stronger than ever, telling Eddie to bond with her like another symbiote. While he was trying to “bond” with her, Juggernaut attacked. Venom transformed back into the six-armed, multi-headed version he had recently acquired. He knocked Juggernaut around but Juggernaut was able to push him back and Venom fell into an opening in reality that had just appeared behind him.</p> <br /> <br /><h3>Venom vs Juggernaut<br /></h3>Venom arrived in some sort of strange dimension after being pushed by Juggernaut. Upon his entrance to the place, he was attacked by Necromancer and Paranoia. He fought them while, in the real world, Juggernaut talked to his girlfriend. After Venom beat Paranoia and Necromancer, Dusk appeared and sent copies of Wolverine and Spider-Man at him. When Spider-Man and Wolverine were dead, Dusk vanished after saying that Venom was getting more crazy, even though he was acting more sane than he had thus far. When Dusk was gone, Venom returned to the real world and noticed the virus was dying. He then went to his girlfriend’s apartment and fought Juggernaut, telling both of them that he was sane again. Juggernaut ran away saying that he wasn’t getting paid enough to keep fighting. Venom talked with his girlfriend about what had been going on. She said they were just going to be friends and Venom was heartbroken. He was able to hold it together though, and they kissed one last time.<p>After he left her apartment Venom returned to the sewers. He put the virus (which he’d named Creep) back in the water he’d found it in, but said that they made a good team and that anytime he needed more strength, or Creep wanted to team up, they would.</p>",

    "description": "<p> </p><h2>Plot<br/></h2> <p> <br/></p><h3>Venom vs Morbius<br/></h3><p>On Halloween night, Venom interrupted two kidnappers trying to steal a trick-or-treater. He tied up one while he beat up the other. The one that had been tied up pulled out a knife and cut himself loose. Venom saw him and threw him across town. Later that night, Venom saw an early edition of the paper and read that the man he had thrown had been killed by goblins. Venom didn’t believe it, but while he was on the subway the lights went out and he was attacked by an army of goblins. Venom took on the whole group and was winning until the goblins unleashed a sonic scream all at once. Venom was thrown from the train and went to his place under San Francisco. </p><p>All over (and under) the city, goblins were attacking people. Venom helped when he could, but they were everywhere. The villain Morbius tried to kill some men at the city dock but the scream of the goblins made him disappear. Demogoblin was also terrorizing the people of San Francisco. Venom went to the subway system to try to find the source of the goblins but he was ambushed. He did well for a while, but their numbers and sonic screams eventually overpowered him. While unconscious, the carried him below ground and to the throne of Morbius!</p> <br/><h3>The Discovery<br/></h3> Venom awoke and started fighting Morbius and accusing him of bringing the goblin to San Francisco. Morbius denied it and they kept fighting until Venom broke a wall and sunlight came in, hurting Morbius and scattering the goblins. Venom decided to hear Morbius out and after they told each other what they’d been through, they teamed up. They fought more goblins underground and Venom saved Morbius’ life. The team made their way to Alcatraz where the mystery of the goblins was to be uncovered by a book they found. The goblins had been summoned by a man who once stayed in Alcatraz and had found a magic necklace that called forth the goblins and bent them to his will. Just as Venom and Morbius discovered this, they were attacked by Demogoblin, who had been summoned by the goblins.   <br/> <br/> <h3>Venom and Morbius vs Demogoblin and Goblin Army<br/></h3> <p>The last issue of “Enemy Within” started with Venom and Morbius taking on Demogoblin and countless tiny goblins in Alcatraz. Morbius was almost beaten by the goblins but Venom was able to use sunlight to beat Demogoblin and his minions. </p><p>Back in the city, Charlie Palene (the man controlling the goblins) was using the magic necklace to make everyone in the city crazy. Venom and Morbius confronted him but couldn’t get the necklace off of him. When they were getting ready to give up, Demogoblin came back and sent the goblins after Charlie. Demogoblin then took the necklace and used its power to grow to enormous size. With the necklace now in his possession the goblins had to obey his every command, even if it endangered them. Demogoblin sent them all over a bridge to drown and then tossed the necklace in after them since water would destroy it. Venom found out that killing the goblins had been Demogoblin’s plan all along.</p>",

Part 1/3:</h3> It is shown that while he was escaping his power source was dropping in energy which meant he needed to find a safe spot. Coincidentally he found himself among a few desperate men who were being abused by land sharks. They could not protect themselves well enough, and were on the path to asking for help. In desperation they decided to hire a hero to take care of the problem, at that very moment <b>Mace'</b>s <i>cloaking device</i> fails and he makes the announcement that he was willing to take the job for food, shelter and a pair of sunglasses which he took from one of the leaders of the group of homeless people. <br/><br/> Although they were not pleased and found <b>Mace</b> to be <i>more of a bounty hunter than a Hero</i>, they decided to hire him and he became quite useful. Even though they did not like his ways, they still couldn't deny he was a huge help, taking down the land sharks and getting them out of the abandoned building.

Venom stopped him and knocked him out even after the man claimed to be a government agent. To prove to his once-girlfriend Beck that he wasn’t a killer, Venom brought the two men back to the city under San Francisco.  <p>When the two men came to, the story was explained. The old man had been part of a team called the Stalkers. One day their plane crashed and all his teammates were bonded with alien technology. He escaped but his teammates were hunting him down. The other man was a government agent and he believed the old man and he was trying to help him.</p> <br/>While Knight, Venom and Vengeance follow leads and hunted them down, the Stalkers were getting more upgrades and their hostages were worrying. The good guys made their way to where the Stalkers were hiding and the two sides fought. The Stalkers were getting their butts handed to them until their leader strapped bombs to Beck and her friend and forced Venom and Vengeance to go into a teleporter so the <i>real</i> hunt could begin. If they didn’t go through, the Stalkers would kill Venom’s friends. When they went through the teleporter they were sent to a random spot on the planet.   <br/><br/>Venom and Vengeance both landed in jungles but not together. Venom killed one of the Stalkers after him and Vengeance killed one too. They soon bumped into each other and found (and killed) a third. Meanwhile back at the Stalkers’ base (a space ship underground), Knight tried to free the girls being held captive but was attacked by the ships defenses. The walls of the vessel tried to turn them all into more Stalker robots.<br/> <p>Back in the jungle, Venom and Vengeance were fighting the lead Stalker. He was the last one but he had the strength of all his fallen brothers. Things were made worse because the area was on fire, which weakened Venom. Vengeance was able to blow up the Stalker and he and Venom escaped, but after they left, the robot came out of the debris and said, “The hunt continues.” </p> Venom and Vengeance got back to their friends right as the techno-organic virus was about to fully take over their bodies. To free them, the two “heroes” destroyed the ship severing the control of the machines. The group returned to the city beneath San Francisco where they were attacked by a further upgraded version of the last remaining Stalker. Calling himself The Stalker, he attacked. They were all teleported back to the jungle where they fought furiously. Right before Venom killed The Stalker, the machine mentioned knowing about a race of symbiotes. After the enemy was dead, Venom wondered if he had been telling the truth.",

    "description": "<h2>Plot</h2><h3>Reunion</h3><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker</a> has just been dumped by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane</a>. Lying on the floor of his attic, he realises what a failure he is. Looking through a room full of boxes, Peter finds a video of him and his parents at a picnic with some friends called the Brocks. Peter decides to send <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/eddie-brock/4005-6733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6733\">Eddie Brock</a>, his childhood friend, a copy of the tape. Peter looks up Eddie on the internet then calls him. Eddie tells him to meet him the next day.</p><p>The next day, Peter arrives at <a href=\"/empire-state-university/4020-43783/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\">Empire State University</a> and finds Eddie. After Peter gives Eddie a copy of the tape, Eddie decides to show him the project their fathers had been working on. Opening a container, Peter sees a pile of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-suit/4055-55728/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55728\">purple goo</a>, which Eddie tells him is their inheritence.</p><p> </p><h3>The Black Suit</h3><p>Continuing on from last issue, Eddie Brock has just showed Peter Parker a pile of goo which he calls their inheritance. He tells Peter that their fathers' idea was for the \"suit\" (as they call it) to be worn by a sick person. The suit would then search the person's body for the right toxins to cure them. He also adds that they were hired by Trask Industries, and that everything they made was owned by the company, and that it used Peter's dad's DNA as a starting palette.</p><p>The next day, Peter gets picked up by Eddie after school. He takes <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy</a> along as well. The three go to a cafe, but in the middle of a casual conversation Peter spoils it by asking Eddie if he thinks their parents were murdered. Eddie says he isn't sure, since while the timing was just right, the plane they were on was full of people, and he can't picture anyone evil enough to destroy a whole plane just for their fathers.</p><p>Back at home, Peter watches video diaries of his father's. After watching his father in anguish over who he can and can't trust, Peter decides to steal back the suit and test it himself, and finish what his dad started. However, when he touches it, the suit spreads all over his body, resulting in a new black suit!</p><p> </p><p>Spidey tests out the suit that his dead dad made. He finds out that the suit makes him more powerful when he saves an superstar, and when he confronts <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shocker/4005-4825/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4825\">the Shocker</a>. When he see's his uncle's killer, the suit start's to take over him and he realizes that he must get it off.</p><p> </p><h3>Venom</h3><p>Eddie Brock's dormitory room, Eddie is talking to Gwen Stacy. He tries to hit on her, to which Gwen firmly rejects. Turning on the TV, Eddie sees footage of Spider-Man's black suit, which looks exactly like the suit their fathers made. Eddie goes to check if the suit is still there, and finds Peter Parker taking it. Peter tells Eddie that they can't control the suit and that he has to destroy it. Eddie guesses that Peter is Spider-Man. Peter apologises to Eddie for taking the suit and goes to destroy it, while Eddie leaves, claiming he has to wrap his head around everything he's heard that night.</p><p>Peter drops the suit down a chimney, where it is burned and destroyed. He returns home, where Gwen tells him that Eddie tried to hit on her. Gwen tells Peter she has an instinct about this kind of thing, and that Eddie's a bad person.</p><p>43 minutes ago....</p><p>After Eddie went to go wrap his head around everything he's heard, he secretly doubled back and found that Peter had taken the suit. Taking a separate sample, Eddie dips his fingers into it, ready to use the power of the suit.</p><p> </p><p>After when Spider-Man get's rid of the suit, it has been revealed that Eddie Brock has another making of the suit and it becomes it's host. When Peter aka Spider-Man is in school, Eddie is outside of the school. When Peter finds out that the suit is outside, he goes outside, he confronts the creature. When he does, he finds out it's Eddie Brock.</p><p> </p><p>The next issue opens with a videotape of Peter's father, Richard, speaking. It turns out Peter isn't the only one caught up in his father's legacy, after all. Richard's path was set in motion by his own father's death due to cancer.</p><p>Richard admits that even before his employers got involved, that he and Brock Sr. had failed. His narration is juxtaposed with the hulking mass of flesh, teeth and tendrils that was once Eddie Brock standing across from Peter in the pouring rain. The battle begins with Venom's tendrils launching at Peter. Peter defends himself while appealing to the Eddie Brock inside to fight the influence of the suit. The vicious struggle outside is momentarily broken by a panel of Peter's Geometry teacher insisting that, while his opinion is biased, that there's nothing more exciting than basic geometry.</p><p>Peter resolves to take the fight off school grounds, to protect innocents and also to protect his identity. Peter, still holding back to keep from hurting his friend underneath the suit, keeps trying to encourage Eddie to fight the suit. He wonders how a normal person like Eddie can fight the suit when Peter barely escaped its grasp. After a hard shot from the creature, Peter decides to take the fight right back to it...by leading it away from the school.</p><p>While <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a> pursues him on the rooftops of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>, Peter wonders how much of Venom's hatred is Eddie and how much of it is the suit. Venom finally catches us, and the two go toe-to-toe. It manages to force Peter off the rooftop. A power cable breaks during the fall and the two are zapped before landing on the roof of a moving car. The car crashes into a building, momentarily disabling the creature.</p><p>Cursing himself for putting innocents in danger, the hooded Peter moves in to check on Eddie, whose face is exposed. Just when all looks well, the suit takes control again, replacing Eddie's young face with that horrific mess of teeth and the trademark ten foot tongue.</p><p>The creature catches Peter by surprise and engulfs him in itself. While struggling to break free, it torments Peter. Peter is about to be wholly swallowed when the old Parker resolve comes through and Peter breaks free. Peter manages to beat it back with a tire when the cops arrive on the scene.</p><p>The creature turns around, and the horrified <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/new-york-police-department/4060-57310/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57310\">cops</a> pump it full of bullets as Peter leaps onto a wall for safety. The creature backs towards the exposed power cable. When Venom and the cable make contact, his death scene is narrated by Richard Parker, with advice to his son that you'll never understand why some people are the way they are. As Venom is reduced to a smoldering pile of the black goo, Richard advises Peter further: \"Don't let other people blame you for what they do to themselves.\" Peter escapes from police gunfire.</p><p>\"I find myself surrounded by people who will do or say anything just for the appearance that they are better than they are.\" Richard's video imparts to Peter. But the video ends on a bright note, as Richard admits he has no idea how the world works and that it's not all bad since he gets to come home to his son and see him grow up. Peter is curled up, head in his arms and on his knees, listening to his father say: \"...I get to watch you become the man I know you will grow up to be... and I can't wait to see how you turned out.\"</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/ultimate-spider-man-hardcover-volume-3/4000-154744/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-154744\">Ultimate Spider-Man Hardcover Vol. 3</a></li><li><a href=\"/ultimate-spider-man-ultimate-collection-volume-three/4000-232980/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-232980\">Ultimate Spider-Man: Ultimate Collection Vol. 3</a></li><li><a href=\"/ultimate-spider-man-venom/4050-35802/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35802\">Ultimate Spider-Man: Venom</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editons</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/coleccionable-ultimate-16-spiderman-8-veneno/4000-498642/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-498642\">Coleccionable Ultimate #16</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot</h2><h3>Origins</h3><p>The Lizard lunges at Spider-Man, who tries to talk him down. It seems that Doctor Curt Connors, who knows Peter's secret, has transformed once again. The reptilian monster he appears to be now is the result of Connors attempt to re-grow his severed arm using lizard DNA. The Lizard finds himself in front of a house. Bursting the door open, he finds Peter asleep in his bed. Conflicted while looking at a photo of Peter and his father, the Lizard strikes Peter!</p><p>Doctor Connors screams himself awake in a cold sweat. He calls his estranged wife (Doris?) and asks about his son (Timmy?). Connors finds out his wife has \"company\" over. His eyes turn to a letter from Stark International with bad news regarding his grant money.</p><p>Out in Brooklyn, Spider-Man swings through the rainy skies following police cars to the scene of a hostage situation. Captain DeWolfe is on the speaker, negotiating with the hostage taker. The criminal demands the liberation of \"Nurhachi\", whoever that is. Spider-Man confronts the man, who turns out to be twice his height!. After a battle that takes out a lot of priceless artifacts, the police surround the scene.</p><p>Captain DeWolfe demands the S.W.A.T. guys put their guns down while one of the hostages insists that Spider-Man was the hero here. The Captain offers Spider-Man medical help for his injuries sustained in the battle, but Spider-Man declines her invitation since he's \"allergic to jail.\"</p><p>Doctor Connors goes to the lab to get some late-night research in. He finds Spider-Man waiting for him inside. Peter asks if he can cash in a favor Connors owes him. Despite not being a medical doctor, he patches up Spidey as best he can. While he's doing this, Peter asks how the whole Lizard thing is going. Connors says the DNA damage is done, but that the Lizard inside him is dormant for the moment. Peter tries to cheer Connors up, but Connors sours the moment with his bleak view of science.</p><p>Peter thanks Connors for his help. Connors offers a ride, but Peter says it'd be faster to web home. Peter does accept a sweatshirt to fight the rain &amp; cold and offers his help with whatever is going on in Connors' life. The good doctor asks for a miracle scientific breakthrough; Peter replies that he IS one.</p><p>Doctor Connors looks at a bloody cotton swab from when he was stitching Peter up. He puts the swab under a microscope and...</p><p>Peter's not feeling too well. Aunt May ordered Peter to stay home and asked Gwen, the lovable live-in orphan girl, to collect Peter's schoolwork for him.</p><p>Back at ESU, Sam the security guard greets Doctor Connors' lab assistant, Ben Reilly. Sam reports that Connors never went home last night. Sure enough, Ben found Doc Connors asleep at his desk, but also found the slide in the microscope, which he found equally astonishing. Connors jerks awake from his nightmare. When Ben expresses interest in what the slide could mean for modern science, Connors swears Ben to secrecy.</p><p>Utterly disappointed in what television had to offer, a sick Peter gets a call at home from Doctor Connors, asking if they can meet. Sick as a dog, Peter drags himself to a coffee shop. Connors reveals that Peter's DNA is a modern scientific miracle that has myriad applications in fighting diseases like Cancer and Alzheimer's. Saying it's almost their responsibility to try, Connors manages to convince Peter to permit him to use his DNA for further testing (as scientific ethnics demand).</p><p>Two months later, Spider-Man breaks up an encounter between The Punisher (the vigilante who puts criminals down (permanently) and Boomerang (the lame Aussie villain that I put down mercilessly). Although he knows the story of how The Punisher lost his family to a bunch of crooked cops, Spider-Man still gives 'im the old \"thwap and smack\". Boomerang offers Spider-Man $10,000 to swing him to safety. Instead, Peter leaves Punisher and Boomerang webbed up for the cops.</p><p>Peter swings back to Connors' lab at ESU to get another wound treated. Connors notes that Peter's looking much healthier, and that they got the grant money because of the work with Peter's blood (which, to the public, is merely the side-effect of another experiment). Peter asks to see it, but Connors says he's running late to meet his kid. Peter swings off.</p><p>Connors goes into the next room and relieves Ben Reilly from work. Ben recommends they increase the temperature to 86 degrees before making a presentation. The two leave, but the issue ends with an ominous look at the sample, which bears an uncanny resemblance to a baby.</p><h3>Ultimate Carnage Unleashed</h3><p>\"Little Ben\" has escaped..</p><p>Connors' lab assistant, Ben Reilly, is horrified to find that his experiment has escaped containment. Reilly calls Connors to notify him, but is horrified to find the dead, dried up body of Sam the lab security guard, the cops, and a bunch of on-lookers.</p><p>On a sock-buying mission at the mall, Gwen Stacy finds Mary Jane Watson, the new \"fry girl\" at a Cajun restaurant. The job helps keep Mary's mind of Peter. Neighbors since May Parker took an orphaned Gwen in, Mary Jane has been uneasy with the fact that Gwen now lives with her boyfriend, Peter. But now, both know Peter's secret, and have come to an understanding. Gwen sees Peter like a little brother and the Parkers as her family and would never come between Mary Jane and Peter.</p><p>An arguing couple find \"the sample\", which vaguely resembles a young child, in an alley. It proceeds to stab its victims and absorb their vitality. The sample now more closely resembles Venom, only is smaller and red.</p><p>Doctor Connors finds his lab sealed off by the police. Captain Jeanne DeWolffe is on hand to ask the docot questions, while Connors meets eyes with Ben Reilly.</p><p>The sample, which will, for simplicity's sake, be known simply as \"Carnage\", begins to have flashes of memories: Peter's memories. Carnage approximates Peter's web-swinging and heads for the Parker house, where Gwen is waiting, keyless. Carnage attacks Gwen the way it does the others, absorbing her vitality dry and leaving her, dead. The last thing Gwen sees is Carnage's face trying to mimic Peter.</p><p>Aunt May returns home late to find the shriveled-up body of Gwen Stacy behind her house.</p><p>At the Daily Bugle, Peter is ecstatic that his newspaper employer, J. Jonah Jameson, made good on his promise to portray Spider-Man in a more positive light. Before Peter can celebrate \"Spider-Man\" Christmas, he gets a phone call from Aunt May that sends him web-slinging across town, out of costume, to find his home once again surrounded by police, reporters and onlookers.</p><p>The police are grilling Aunt May when she notices Peter. The detective questioning her turns his inquiries to Peter, thinly veiling his suspicion that Peter had something to do with this. Captain Jeanne De Wolfe is on site, within earshot of Peter. Our hero hears that there have been a few similar deaths reported: possibly a mutant, a virus, or a vampire. Meanwhile, May fights the cops tooth and nail against their interrogations and their refusal to let Peter in his house.</p><p>Downstairs and alone, Peter rips open his book bag with the Spider-Man costume in it, fuming.</p><p>At Mary Jane's house next door, May lashes out at the non-cooperative person at the number she has for Gwen's mother. MJ's mom offers their home (recently free of MJ's dirtbag father) for as long as they need it. In the den, MJ goes to talk to Peter alone. MJ mentions the moment her and Gwen shared at the mall. Peter wonders if he was a good friend to Gwen, if his costumed adventures are really doing any good, then chokes up and loses it.</p><p>In the middle of the night, Peter runs what he heard from the cops through his head, looking through the gamut of his rogues' gallery, until he remembers they mentioned a death at Empire State. Sure enough, when he looks out his window, he finds Doctor Connors. Peter goes out and attacks Connors, who he finds responsible.</p><p>Connors manages to talk Peter down and explain what happened. Apparently \"Carnage\" was a rejuvenating organism using Peter's DNA, Connors DNA, and work stolen from Peter's late father, who was an expert in cellular reconstruction. Peter expresses his utter disgust for Connors, only to find Carnage waiting for them both!</p><p>The organism, who, for lack of a better name, I will call Carnage, starts to resemble Peter again. Peter orders Connors back to his lab so that the doctor can find out how to kill it, threatening to throw it in a room with Connors himself.</p><p>What unfolds is a battle in the middle of the night where Peter blames himself for this creature. HUMAN pieces of garbage he can handle, but murderous, mutated clones of himself? Peter thinks he's failed completely, but has little more time to ruminate when Carnage attacks and kills two more cops. Carnage takes on a very familiar form, closely resembling Peter's late father.</p><p>Connors returns to his lab to find Peter waiting for him. Peter explains that the creature was looking for Peter to stabilize its own DNA (which is why it attacked the others). The face we kept seeing wasn't Peter's... it was Peter's father's face. Peter stopped thinking and let instinct take over. In a clear-cut case of him-or-it (emphasis on it: Peter didn't see it as any more than a spore or a virus), Peter threw the creature down a smokestack. Peter again threatens to kill Connors, but naturally doesn't follow up. Later, Connors goes to a police station and turns himself in.</p><p>The next morning, MJ asks if Peter caught the guy. Peter also announces that he's done with Spider-Man.</p><p>Ben Reilly shows up at work, and the dean tells him that his and Connors' experiment are what killed the guard (wait... Smitty? I thought his name was Sam.). Since Connors is in custody, the lab is closed, and Ben is out of a job. Ben asks if he can get his things from the lab. While no one is looking, Ben takes a test tube marked \"Parker: Sample #2\" and takes it, with a slight grin on his face.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/ultimate-spider-man-carnage/4050-35938/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35938\">Ultimate Spider-Man: Carnage</a></li><li><a href=\"/ultimate-spider-man-hardcover-volume-6/4000-154844/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-154844\">Ultimate Spider-Man Hardcover Vol. 6</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/ultimate-spiderman-42/4000-298169/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-298169\">Ultimate Spiderman #42</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/ultimate-spiderman-43/4000-298170/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-298170\">Ultimate Spiderman #43</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/ultimate-spiderman-44/4000-298171/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-298171\">Ultimate Spiderman #44</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

    "deck": "Carnage has escaped from Ravencroft, and faces Spider-Man (Ben Reilly). But when his symbiote bonds with him, it turns him into the Spider-Carnage.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot</h2><p>The story begins with Ben, as Spider-man, making a quick exit from Ravencroft (asylum for the criminally insane) where he has gone to investigate the recent sightings of a Carnage-like creature on the streets of New York. While learning that Cletus Kasady (the Carnage symbiote's host) has not escaped, Ben is forced leave fast when the police arrive (still wanting him for questioning about the stolen spider-skeleton). Peter Parker arrives in a nice new rental car, Ben hops in and the two make a hasty retreat from the police.</p><p>Most of the issue is told in the form of a conversation between Peter and Ben. We learn that Ben's girlfriend, Jessica, a would-be photographer for the Daily Bugle, is obsessed with Spider-man ... because she believes he murdered her father. However, just as Ben is about to learn more, he is interupted by a phone call from Peter, who suggests that they take the spider-skeleton to the Avengers to find out just who (or what) it really is. In a scene featuring Peter and Mary Jane, Peter reveals that he doesn't trust the results of Seward Trainer, Ben's friend, and wants to get the results from an un-biased source.</p><p>The conversation ends as Peter and Ben arrive at the Avengers' temporary headquarters just out of the city. While tests are being conducted on the skeleton, Peter uses a photo-enhancer to brighten a picture of Jessica and her father taken years ago. On the franc tic final page, we learn that the man who Jessica blames Spider-man for killing is actually the burglar who shot Peter/Ben's Uncle Ben ... and that the skeleton found at the bottom of the smokestack is a clone (which makes Ben and Peter ask: if that's the clone, what does that make me?)</p><h3>Spider-Carnage Unleashed</h3><p>Ben and Peter discuss what the results of the skeleton might mean as they return from the Avengers' headquarters. Both begin to question what the new discovery means about who/what they are.</p><p>Meanwhile, Carnage's symbiote has indeed escaped, though without his host (Cletus Kassidy). After several pages of fighting with Spider-man and anyone else who gets in his way, the symbiote leaves its current host body and bonds with Ben, forming a sort of \"Spider-Carnage.\"</p><p>However, the Carnage situation seems to take a back seat in this issue (despite taking up most of the story) when Peter goes to see Seward Trainer in the hospital. Seward refuses to see him--because of a phone call he receives just as Peter is entering the hospital. The man on the other end of the phone call? A mysterious, shadowed figure in a car just outside the hospital. In just one short page, the clone saga has suddenly taken a whole new direction.</p><p>Ben in the midst of an inner battle with the Carnage symbiote, but quickly switches over to a touching scene in which Peter struggles with his own inner demons over the whole clone situation.</p><p>Shortly after, Peter goes to see Ben (who, by this time, has made it back to his apartment) and they get into an argument over Seward Trainer. Ben trusts him unquestioningly, and does not react well to Peter's comments that there might be more to the situation than they know. Under the influence of the Carnage symbiote, it takes all of Ben's will-power not to strike out a Peter.</p><p>Peter leaves Ben and heads over to the hospital to get some answers from Seward, but finds that Trainer had already checked out. However, he does learn that something called the Multivex Corporation paid all of Seward's medical bills.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ben, as Spider-Carnage, is wreaking havoc on the hospital roof, and there is a confrontation between a powerless Peter and an extra-powered Ben. Peter barely escapes with his life when Ben temporarily regains control, but when Ben's reaction to Seward remains the same, Peter vows to learn the truth ... no matter what.</p><p>In part four, the Seward Trainer mystery deepens (and confirms our suspicions that something sinister is going on here) when Peter goes to the Multivex Corporation to see if he can find Seward. He is denied any information, but the actions of those working for Multivex solidy his suspicions. Meanwhile, we catch a glimpse of Seward Trainer in a darkened room speaking with a shadowy figure, who tells Trainer \"I'd prefer you had privacy to continue your work ...\" And so it appears that the clone saga is far from over.</p><p>Elsewhere, Ben returns to Ravencroft to try to find some answers about the symbiote from its original host, Cletus Kassidy. After a rather long and draining inner battle, Ben frees himself of the symbiote (which a weakened Kassidy finally gets to return to him). Ben is upset that he couldn't control the symbiote within him, but is heartened by the encouraging words of John Jameson, security chief at Ravencroft, and the issue ends with Ben feeling a bit better about his role as Spider-man.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-311042\" href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-ben-reilly-epic-book-three/4000-311042/\" slug=\"the-amazing-spider-man-the-complete-ben-reilly-epic-book-three\">The Amazing Spider-Man: The Complete Ben Reilly Epic Book 3</a></li></ul>",

This is the beginning of a rift in their relationship. </p><p>The signing ceremony for the contract between S.I. and Carnelia is held at the UN Building. The Carnelian ambassador requested that Iron Man be present at the event. Cabe is also present at the ceremony as the bodyguard for the Carnelian ambassador. Cabe displays her distaste with the armored Avenger by insulting Iron Man a few minutes prior to the ceremony. The Carnelian ambassador is a fan of Iron Man and one of the major reasons that Stark International was chosen to build the plant in Carnelia. However, during the signing ceremony, Hammer uses the hypersonic device to activate Iron Man's repulsor and blasts the ambassador, killing him. </p><p> </p><p>The conflicts between Stark and Cabe worsen and they spend time apart as Stark attempts to clear Iron Man of murder charges. Stark is forced to surrender Iron Man's armor (but secretly keeps a spare for himself), and Stark begins his own investigation of who is taking control of his armor. After getting some combat training from <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, Stark agrees to let <a href=\"/scott-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Scott Lang</a> follow up a lead. When Iron Man and <a href=\"/bethany-cabe/4005-33030/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33030\">Bethany Cabe</a> were attacked at the casino a few days back, one of the assailants, <a href=\"/whiplash/4005-12709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12709\">Whiplash</a>, said that their employer's name was Hammer. Scott Lang as Ant-Man questions Whiplash at <a href=\"/rykers-island/4020-55830/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55830\">Riker's Island Prison</a> for more information. Lang, as Ant-Man, coerces Whiplash into revealing that Hammer is in Monaco and Lang gave the location to Stark.</p><p>Later, Hammer gets Whiplash, the Melter and the Blizzard out of custody. Soon Stark and <a href=\"/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">Jim Rhodes</a> land in Monaco, then Stark is captured by Hammer's henchmen and brought to his headquarters via an amphibious craft. Stark learns that although Hammer is not as public a figure as Stark, Hammer's wealth and power is second only to that of Stark's influence. Stark International had been Hammer's business rival for a long time but the Carnelian contract was the most recent competition between the two. Stark also learns that losing the Carnelian contract to him was the main reason that Hammer discredited him.</p><p> </p><p>Stark then tries to escape the complex, only to learn that it is a moving, floating, houseboat. Stark is put in a cell, but then he escapes again, destroys the transmitter and changes into his Iron Man armor. Hammer sends his <a href=\"/justin-hammers-minions/4060-55788/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55788\">minions</a> after Iron Man, who dispatches them easily, and then Hammer attempts to escape to international waters by powering up jet powered lift pods on the bottom of his floating Villa.</p><p>Iron Man cracks the structure in half but Hammer is able to escape in another vehicle with the aid of the first Spymaster. Stark is able to prove Iron Man's innocence when he captures the scientist who created the hypersonic scan transmitter. As a result of Hammer's actions, though, Stark experiences psychological repercussions. Along with other issues that plagued Stark, he would soon be driven further into alcoholism. Stark engages in binge drinking and alienates those close to him such as Cabe and <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Edwin Jarvis</a>. Stark eventually asks for help from Cabe and Jarvis and successfully recovers from this addiction when he admits to being an alcoholic.</p><h3>Obadiah Stane</h3><p>Tony Stark falls off the wagon when he becomes the target of <a href=\"/obadiah-stane/4005-31197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31197\">Obadiah Stane</a>.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/iron-man-demon-in-a-bottle/4050-30701/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30701\">Iron Man: Demon In A Bottle HC</a></li><li><a href=\"/iron-man-demon-in-a-bottle/4050-21200/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21200\">Iron Man: Demon In A Bottle TPB</a></li></ul><h2>Non-US Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/die-offizielle-marvel-comic-sammlung-29-vol-1-iron/4000-463828/\">Die offizielle Marvel-Comic-Sammlung #29 - Vol. 1 - Iron Man - Dämon aus der Flasche</a> (German)</li></ul>",

Flash forward to present day where Mary Jane visits Peter, She tells him that she wants to be friends even after the way their relationship ended and that they were once going to be married. The story then shifts to the events that took place in Annual 21. Spider-man stops a robbery by Electro and some other men, but this time one of the men that was arrested is left in a squad car when a red bird flies in and unlocks the door giving the man a chance to escape. When Peter gets home he starts to think about whether it is safe for Mary Jane to marry him and worries that she will suffer the same fate as Gwen did. Mary Jane tells him to forget about it and that she is so excited to be getting married. The Guy who was set free by the bird is shown making a deal with an unknown person asking the person to take care of some business for him. We are then shown Peter's bachelor and Mary Jane's bachelorette parties, Peter's is a small party consisting of himself Flash Thomson and Harry Osborn where Peter begins to tell them that he is having doubts about the Wedding. Mary Jane however is having her party in style surrounded by friends along with other men. That night Peter wakes up after having a nightmare about all of his villeins attacking his wedding, this causes him to have more doubt so he decides to go out as Spider-man for a while. While out Peter finds the guy who was released from the squad car causing trouble, but when he intervenes he is hit on the head with a cinder block and when chasing after the guy they fall of the roof and Peter saves the mans life by absorbing the impact of the fall and both men are left unconscious. When Mary Jane arrives at the wedding she finds that Peter isn't there and over hears Flash talking about what Peter said at his bachelor party so she tries to call him, but he doesn't answer and people begin to leave. The man wakes up and kicks a still unconscious Spider-man in the face saying that he will leave him alone since he saved him from the fall and by the time Peter begins to wake up it is already too late. Back at the present day while Peter is off getting himself more tea Mary Jane is shown looking like there is another reason for her visit.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-36727\" href=\"/amazing-spider-man-one-moment-in-time/4050-36727/\">Amazing Spider-Man: One Moment in Time</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Edition</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-319591\" href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319591/\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #55</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-319592\" href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319592/\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #56</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-319593\" href=\"/the-astonishing-spider-man-/4000-319593/\">The Astonishing Spider-Man #57</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>Genetech and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\" href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" slug=\"aim\">A.I.M.</a> both want a specific energy source. The two groups hire out help to collect the source but only one person seems to be able to do so: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2154\" href=\"/harness/4005-2154/\" slug=\"harness\">Harness</a>. By using a boy named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2155\" href=\"/piecemeal/4005-2155/\" slug=\"piecemeal\">Piecemeal</a>, Harness does exactly what the name suggests and harnesses the energy sources across the globe by getting Piecemeal to \"eat\" them. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\" href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" slug=\"new-mutants\">New Mutants</a> (now <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\" href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" slug=\"x-force\">X-Force</a>) and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\" href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" slug=\"new-warriors\">New Warriors</a> are already on the trail of the energy sucking culprit when they run into each other, causing a quick scuffle. Deciding the work together, the teams split up and head to the biggest source of energy: <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43505\" href=\"/muir-island/4020-43505/\" slug=\"muir-island\">Muir Island</a>. The island mutants aren't too thrilled to get company (due to the influence of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\" href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" slug=\"shadow-king\">Shadow King</a>) but offer to help when they learn that the energy being gathered is to resurrect <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\" href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" slug=\"moira-mactaggert\">Moira</a>'s son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2165\" href=\"/proteus/4005-2165/\" slug=\"proteus\">Proteus</a>.</p><p>After capturing Harness and Piecemeal, the mutants try to extract the energy but to no avail. Proteus is reborn and fuses with the boy. The mutants don't have long to stop Proteus before he turns the earth into a huge, logical equation. They resort logic and reason as the only approach and offer Proteus the ultimate happiness: death.</p><p>All along, it seems as if the events had been manipulated from behind the scenes by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2162\" href=\"/gideon/4005-2162/\" slug=\"gideon\">Gideon</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1470\" href=\"/toad/4005-1470/\" slug=\"toad\">Toad</a>.

Previous issues in countless books had speculated as to why Moira and her crew had been acting so strangely; the Shadow King is shown to have a grip on the mutants. This appears to answer those earlier questions (and comes to an apex in the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55861\" href=\"/muir-island-saga/4045-55861/\" slug=\"muir-island-saga\">Muir Island Saga</a>).</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-212988\" href=\"/new-warriors-classic-volume-2/4000-212988/\" slug=\"new-warriors-classic-volume-2\">New Warriors Classic Vol. 2</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-293872\" href=\"/marvel-miniserie-sovrani-del-dolore-1/4000-293872/\" slug=\"marvel-miniserie-sovrani-del-dolore-1\">Marvel Miniserie #4</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-293873\" href=\"/marvel-miniserie-sovrani-del-dolore-2/4000-293873/\" slug=\"marvel-miniserie-sovrani-del-dolore-2\">Marvel Miniserie #5</a></li></ul>",

Meanwhile, Nova pursues the false Quasar — who originated from The Fault and briefly took over Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. on Earth — into deep space as he broadcasts warnings about the danger The Fault represents. The real Quasar responds, telling him that an armada of Kree/Shi'ar ships is on its way to The Fault. As Quasar takes off to help capture his impostor, Nova intercepts the false Quasar at the mouth of The Fault, where he discovers numerous fleets of ships belonging to the Universal Church of Truth lying in wait. Nova is suddenly attacked by Adam Magus, but is assisted by Quasar, who quickly dispatches his other self. To Quasar's surprise, numerous planets belonging to The Universal Church of Truth suddenly teleport next to The Fault. Magus brushes aside both Nova and Quasar and chants one word: Ignition. The planets suddenly detonate, resulting in a massive cosmic-scale explosion that rips open The Fault. Mantis, Moondragon and Cosmo sense that something \"very bad\" has just happened, but before the Guardians of the Galaxy can react, Thanos breaks free from his cell and begins running rampant. Meanwhile, a mysterious figure from The Fault approaches Magus and the false Quasar. They acknowledge him as their lord and report their progress to him. As the shadowed figure seemingly kills Magus, he is revealed to be an alternate version of Mar-Vell, who declares that his first priority will be to cleanse this universe of death.</p><p>As Nova and Quasar struggle to defend the Kree/Shiar warships against the creatures of The Fault, they receive assistance from the Silver Surfer, who heralds the arrival of Galactus, Aegis, Tenebrous, and the Celestials to the battle. On the other side of The Fault, the Guardians of the Galaxy easily dispose of the alternate Defenders, before realizing that their foes cannot die in the Cancerverse. The Defenders begin to hesitate in fear of Thanos, who regains consciousness and obliterates the Defenders, discovering that he alone can deliver permanent death to beings in the Cancerverse. Thanos and the Guardians are approached by the alternate version of the Vision, who is unchanged due to his inorganic nature. Meanwhile, as Nova, Quasar and the Silver Surfer watch Galactus and the other cosmic abstracts, they observe something huge coming from The Fault. The Surfer tells them the enemy is responding to the arrival of Galactus and the other abstracts, and describes the approaching object as \"a blasphemy, a heresy.... The Galactus Engine.\" A massive mechanical Galactus-shaped head then emerges from The Fault, dwarfing even a Celestial in size as it approaches. During the invasion of the Cancerverse into mainstream Marvel reality, the Guardians of the Galaxy and a newly-resurrected Thanos were forced in turn to go into the Cancerverse to effect a means of saving the Marvel Universe. However, the mix of metaphysical energies involved in the death-free Cancerverse threw Drax's \"anti-Thanos\" programming into overdrive (since Drax himself is a so-called 'Avatar of Life'), and even the extreme, universal peril of the situation could not stop the normally sane hero from lashing out at Thanos uncontrollably. Thanos was finally forced to disintegrate Drax with a single, massive blast. The rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy met on Titan to take the fight back to Lord Mar-vell while Nova and his Cosmic Avengers, Beta Ray Bill, Ronan, Silver Surfer and Quasar dealt with the Revengers directly. In the resulting battle, Nova's team was defeated and he channeled a large portion of the Nova Force into Quasar before leaving to take on Mar-vell himself. It was there that Thanos betrayed his team to Lord Mar-vell and the Many Angled Ones but when Mar-vell went to kill Thanos, it was revealed that Death was hiding inside him and that is why he was unable to be killed. In doing so, Death killed Mar-vell and destroyed the Cancerverse but at a price. Thanos was once again ignored by Death that sent him in a furious rage. With no choice left, Starlord used the last of the cosmic cube power and Nova used the entire Nova Force to send the Guardians of the Galaxy back to the 616-Universe and contained Thanos long enough for the Fault to collapse on itself trapping all three of them in limbo. It us unknown if any of them survived. Rocket and Quasar are left in the aftermath of the war looking over two statues of Nova and Star-lord with Rocket replying: \"Dammit guys. Why did you have to be such heroes?\"</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-39255\" href=\"/thanos-imperative/4050-39255/\" slug=\"thanos-imperative\">Thanos Imperative</a></li></ul>",

Before the Jury goes out on a reconnaissance mission, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11214\" href=\"/ramshot/4005-11214/\" slug=\"ramshot\">Ramshot</a> reveals that he isn't sure hunting Spider-Man is the right thing to do. He told Mr. Taylor he signed on to punish Venom for killing Mr. Taylor's son, but Spider-Man is one of the good guys. Mr. Taylor assures him that bringing Spider-Man in is for the greater good, so Ramshot joins the rest of his teammates.</p><p>While Ramshot is returning to his teammates, Taylor is informed that one of the motion detectors had been damaged. Taylor orders someone to go out and fix it. As one of Taylor's men reaches the detector, he is picked up by Spider-Man. Spider-Man tells the man he knows what the detector is and wants to know why it is there or he will take him to the police. Spider-Man is told that he they aren't doing anything illegal and they have rented to use that space. Frustrated by making a mistake and confused by who might be trying to track him, Spider-Man returns home to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\" href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" slug=\"mary-jane\">Mary Jane</a>. Mary Jane is apartment hunting since <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15408\" href=\"/liz-allan/4005-15408/\" slug=\"liz-allan\">Liz</a> is making the two of them move out. Peter explains to her that he is going to go out later to find out the source of the detectors. Peter then leaves for his class at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\" href=\"/empire-state-university/4020-43783/\" slug=\"empire-state-university\">ESU</a>, so he can go out as Spider-Man later.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\" href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" slug=\"aunt-may\">Aunt May</a> is suspicious of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15261\" href=\"/richard-parker/4005-15261/\" slug=\"richard-parker\">Richard</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15262\" href=\"/mary-parker/4005-15262/\" slug=\"mary-parker\">Mary Parker</a>, Peter's parents. They had recently returned after being dead for twenty years, but a private investigator hired by Aunt May wasn't able to turn up anything on them. Even without evidence, May had a gut feeling that they weren't who they claimed to be. May goes to Peter's apartment to talk to Mary Jane about this problem. She explains to Mary Jane that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\" href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" slug=\"uncle-ben\">Ben</a> and her were actually married six months in secret before their public wedding. The only person who was a witness to that wedding was Ricard and Mary. But when Richard talked to May about her anniversary, he talked about their public one instead of the real anniversary. Mary Jane reassured her that there was probably a reason why he didn't mention the official anniversary. May told Mary Jane that she was probably being just a silly old woman and left, but before she did she asked that Mary Jane didn't mention any of this to Peter. Mary Jane agreed, but wondered if it was right to keep it from Peter since they are trying to have and honest marriage. She then pulled out a cigarette and started smoking.</p><p>That night, Spider-Man swings over to one of the detectors, which caused his Spider-Sense to go off. Through force of will, Spider-Man ignored his Spider-Sense and remained close to the detector so that someone would come and he could get the answers he is looking for. Spider-Man's sense starts warning him of danger coming from all directions, as the Jury springs in to attack him. During the fight, Spider-Man tries to reason with the Jury, but they explain to him that they have orders to bring him in. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11213\" href=\"/bomblast/4005-11213/\" slug=\"bomblast\">Bomblast</a> fires a miss shot which causes a rooftop balcony to start collapsing which people on it. One of them falls off the roof, but Spider-Man goes in for the save with his Spider-Sense ringing because he is about to get attack by Ramshot. Ramshot holds his fire though, so that Spider-Man can save the man from falling. Ramshot explains to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-18440\" href=\"/sentry/4005-18440/\" slug=\"sentry\">Sentry</a> that he couldn't attack him while he was saving someone, so Sentry orders him to return back to base. Through teamwork, the Jury are able to out power Spider-Man and knock him out.</p><p>When Spider-man awakens he is to find himself tied to a pole. He also finds that he is being drugged to keep him from breaking out of his restraints. Spider-Man asks Taylor why he wants to kill him. Taylor explains they are not after murder, but justice for bringing the alien Venom to Earth. While put on the witness stand, Screech tries to remove Spider-Man's mask. Before he does Taylor orders him to stop, saying that they are men of honor. He tells the Jury that Spider-Man shall keep his identity until after being proven guilty. Spider-Man asks why they are putting him on trail, and Taylor tells him that he is responsible for the creation of one of the worst mass killers in history. When Spider-Man tells him he is crazy, Taylor asks him if he has no sense of responsibility. With his thoughts dulled by the drugs, Spider-Man loses himself in his thoughts thinking about his responsibility. Taylor tells the Jury they will take a thirty minute recess while Spider-Man recovers because he should have the right to hear the words spoken against him. As they are leaving the room, Ramshot appears to be feeling guilty of the treatment Spider-Man is getting.</p><p>The next day, Mary Jane is told by her boss that her role on the TV show is being reduced to a recurring role because the character isn't a hit with fans. He tells her that they will get her a couple of mall appearances though. Furious, Mary Jane goes out for a smoke so she can think about all that is happening in her life. A man approaches her and explains that he is allergic to cigarette smoke and asks her to put it out. Mary Jane blows up on the stranger and tells him that if she wants to kill herself she has every right too. She quickly realized what she had told the man though. Over in Queens, May gets a call from her private detective to tell her he is quitting the case against Richard and Mary Parker. He explains that there is no longer a trail to follow, and to continue so would be a waste of money. May yells at him and slams the phone down on the hook. She realized that wasn't like her to act that way against someone who is trying to be helpful.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ramshot had brought Spider-Man something to drink so he could recover from the drugs. Spider-Man tells Ramshot that he can tell he's not like the others, and asks him to help him escape. Ramshot seemed hesitant, but before he could answer Taylor shows up and orders him out of the room. After a quick pep talk, Taylor seemed to have gained Ramshot's trust again in what they are doing. While being left alone, Spider-Man musters the strength to break the the pole his tired to. Screech enters the room and calls the others for back up. As Spider-Man leaps out the window, Sentry grabs the ropes still tied to his body and pulls him back in the building. Dazed from the drugs still, Spider-Man is knocked out before he has a chance to get back up. Taylor orders for Spider-Man to be re-secured and for his dosage of drugs to be increased so he can't escape again.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Spider-Man wakes up from the drugs and Taylor calls in the next witness against him, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-26657\" href=\"/irene-karnowsky/4005-26657/\" slug=\"irene-karnowsky\">Irene Karnowsky</a>. Ireme tells Spider-Man that her life and her daughter Suzie's life was ruined thanks to Venom. Spider-Man finally realizes that this is all about how he had brought Venom back with him from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\" href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" slug=\"beyonder\">Beyonder's</a> World. How after losing the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56880\" href=\"/symbiotes/4060-56880/\" slug=\"symbiotes\">symbiote</a>, it had gone to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6733\" href=\"/eddie-brock/4005-6733/\" slug=\"eddie-brock\">Eddie Brock</a> and later created his son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1490\" href=\"/carnage/4005-1490/\" slug=\"carnage\">Carnage</a>. Irene explains last Christmas, she took her six year old daughter, Suzie, shopping in Midtown. Venom had chased him through a department store while they were there. Suzie had gone to see a clown. Apparently Venom thought he was protecting Suzie from the clown, but she was so traumatized that she has spoken since the event. Spider-Man is offered a chance to defend himself in respects to being a fair trial. But Spider-Man tells Taylor there is no need, because he is guilty as charged. Taylor announces that Spider-Man has been found guilty for crimes against humanity and is sentenced to death. Before the Jury finishes Spider-Man off for good, Ramshot steps in the way. He tells them that he can't let them kill a man who has saved so many lives. Taylor gives Spider-Man the chance to redeem himself if he helps them recover and item that will help kill Venom. Spider-Man agrees even though this goes against his belief about killing.</p><p>While Spider-Man is going through trail, Mary Jane had gone out dancing to relieve stress. He starts dancing with one of the guys there at the club, but he is looking for more than just a dance. Mary Jane tells him that she is married and the man said that he is too but he didn't care. Since the man wouldn't back off, Mary Jane threatens him with her lighter after lighting up another cigarette. Dancing is the only way Mary Jane knew how to relieve stress since Peter had been missing for the last 24 hours, but she can't tell anyone since he is Spider-Man.</p><p>Back at the Jury's base, Spider-Man is given a transceiver so that he can stay in contact with Taylor as well as the rest of the Jury. He is also told that their mission is to break into a military base. There they have an incomplete teleportation device. When the device is trained on an object, it breaks it down by the atoms but is unable to reassemble them. The plan is to use this device on Venom and literally break him down atom by atom. Spider-Man tells them that that is a great plan, but his thoughts suggest otherwise now that the drugs are starting to come out of his system. Before they leave for the mission, Taylor tells Ramshot that he is suspended from the Jury until further notice.</p><p>Spider-Man and the Jury make it into the Government Research Facility, by crawling through the air vents. Before jumping out of the vents, Spider-Man's Spider-Sense warns them that they shouldn't step on the floor. So he shoots a webline across the room so that they can climb safely across it without sounding the alarm system. Spider-Man leads the Jury through the base, pointing out all the security devices so they can easily avoid them. They are spotted by an armed guard, so Screech takes him out with a blast. Spider-Man jumps on Screech telling him they can't kill anyone, but Screech tells him it was just a stun blast.</p><p>Meanwhile at the HQ, Ramshot pleads with Taylor to let him stay on the team. He tells him he only went against them because he signed on to kill Venom. Spider-Man was an innocent person, who shouldn't be punished. Taylor explains that he had never planned on killing Spider-Man in the first place. Everything was set up so that after he was drugged they could convince Spider-Man to help them get the Teleportation Device from the base. He didn't tell the rest of the Jury, because he wasn't sure if Spider-Man's Spider-Sense could tell if their threats were real or not. Ramshot tells him that it was great he stepped in then, because it made the situation seem more real. Taylor tells him that he is still off active duty because that is reserved for those whose loyalties are clear.</p><p>At the Research Facility, Spider-Man and the Jury have recovered the teleportation device. Sentry tries it out on one the lab computers, which destroys it instantly. Finally clean of the drugs, Spider- Man realizes they are going to use this on Brock to kill him. Spider-Man punches Sentry sending back into some equipment. The hit had damage the teleportation device and causes it to explode, taking Sentry out of the fight as well. Now that the Jury is only down to three members, Spider-Man quickly defeats the remain members using his strength and agility. He the escapes through the air vent before the lab guards show up and know that he was ever there.</p><p>Spider-Man returns home to find Mary Jane lying on the couch sleeping. Next to her is an ash tray full of cigarette butts and a pack of cigarettes. Peter wakes her and tells her they have a lot to talk about, but first they have to go see <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15286\" href=\"/nick-katzenberg/4005-15286/\" slug=\"nick-katzenberg\">Nick</a>. Mary Jane goes with Peter, though she can't figure out why. When they get to the hospital where Nick is, Mary Jane is freaked out by the site of him. Nick explains that he has had cancer and starts having a coughing attack. Mary Jane starts crying and asks Peter how he can be so cruel before running out of the room. Peter walks out of the room and tells Mary Jane that he is sorry. She tells him that she isn't mad at him,but herself for being weak. She then crushes her package of cigarettes and throws them away.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Summary</h2><p>The Desturi begin the trial of <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Ororo Storm</a>, who is being charged with treason, practicing witchcraft, and crimes against humanity. Storm doesn't go along with the proceedings, refusing to cooperate in any manner. Outside, news reporters are covering the trial but are quickly ushered away. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> is attempting to infiltrate the Wakandan vault that safeguards their precious <a href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">Vibranium</a>. All his attempts have been failing him, causing him to think of new options. The <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> are watching the news coverage from Nation X. They all ponder the possibilities that could have caused this current predicament. <a href=\"/cipher/4005-58547/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58547\">Cipher</a> enters the room with a message for <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> who tells her he's busy. <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a> enters telling Cyclops he needs to come immediately. The X-Men go outside to see <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">T'Challa</a> and <a href=\"/shuri/4005-58997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri</a> with a small army of Wakandan soldiers arrive. Back in <a href=\"/wakanda/4020-41027/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41027\">Wakanda</a>, Storm has been moved to a cell designed by her husband. She's informed that she has no possible way of escaping.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101270/3570828-9433353209-12107.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3570828\" data-ratio=\"0.87671232876712\" data-width=\"657\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 657px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101270/3570828-9433353209-12107.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3570828\"><img alt=\"The X-Men join the fight—unofficially—to reclaim Wakanda\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101270/3570828-9433353209-12107.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101270/3570828-9433353209-12107.jpg 657w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101270/3570828-9433353209-12107.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The X-Men join the fight—unofficially—to reclaim Wakanda</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>, <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">T'Challa</a> and <a href=\"/shuri/4005-58997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri</a> sit down together to talk about everything going on. T'Challa implores that the X-Men help them in their fight to take back their country. He explains his investigation has led him to believe that <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> is behind everything and that he managed to infiltrate nanite swarms into the food and water of Wakanda which resulted in every person being turned into living cameras. T'Challa explains he had no choice but to choose the future of his country over his wife. He further explains that Doom is after <a href=\"/wakanda/4020-41027/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41027\">Wakanda's</a> <a href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">Vibranium</a> source. After consideration, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> responds that he can in no way sanction a mission like this due to the lack of stability his nation is currently suffering from. He then goes on to say that although he can't sanction the mission, he can't stop anyone from following their hearts. <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a>, and <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> take off with T'Challa and Shuri to aide them in their fight and save <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>. On the way to Wakanda, T'Challa goes over tactical strategies with everyone.</p><p>Doom removes Storm from her prison cell and leads her to the Vibranium vault. He demands her help in defusing the lock. To get her to cooperate, he orders one of his soldier to kill an innocent civilian. He then threatens Storm by using T'Challa's mother as leverage.</p><p>T'Challa, Shuri, and their reinforcements arrive in Wakanda. Nightcrawler teleports T'Challa and Shuri inside. Shuri proceeds to break Doom's puppet ruler T'Kan's neck after the pair exchanged words. Together with T'Challa, they murder every Desturi council member present. Nightcrawler is shocked at her and T'Challa's actions. They simply respond that they are at war and it's how you deal with traitors.</p><p>Shuri tells T'Challa to head to the Vibrainium vault and save Storm while she purges the palace of every Desturi member. As Nightcrawler attempts to teleport T'Challa to the vault, he hits what he refers to as an invisible wall. They realize Doctor Doom must have some type of technology or magic that is stopping them from entering. Doom has been monitoring them from the vault and he proceeds to once again threaten Storm. Storm says there's no way she can get past the last lock on the vault.</p><p>Nightcrawler <a href=\"/teleportation/4015-56002/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56002\">teleports</a> Wolverine and Colossus inside the palace to assist them in the battle to come. T'Challa tells <a href=\"/aneka/4005-68046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68046\">Aneka</a> (leader of the <a href=\"/dora-milaje/4060-55780/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55780\">Dora Milaje</a>) to buy him an hour's time so he can complete his mission. She proceeds to give a short speech to her fellow Dora Milaje sisters and head to battle. Back in the vault, Storm tells Doom that T'Challa is coming and will kill him for what he's done. Doom informs her that T'Challa thinks he's set a trap for Doom when in fact, T'Challa has played into his. He realizes the final lock is not a lock, but a puzzle.</p><p>On the battlefield Shuri kills a man who had laid down his arms. Nightcrawler was again shocked when Shuri claimed he was in her way. Wolverine tells her to be careful and that she doesn't want to lose herself. She tells him she's finally found herself.</p><p>As Doom tries to get past the last lock, a message appears saying \"only through purity unencumbered by pretense may you pass.\" Doom ponders on the meaning. T'Challa enters moments later to find his wife's life at risk. Doom is threatening to kill her if T'Challa doesn't reveal the key to the last lock in five seconds. As Doom begins to count down the seconds, T'Challa doesn't move an inch. As he reaches zero, Doom tells him that was satisfying and throws Storm to T'Challa as he claims victory. T'Challa opens the vaults door to find it empty and the word checkmate written on the wall.</p><p>Shuri and T'Challa meet with the Fantastic Four and inform them on everything that has happened. They ask for their help since they have faced Doom countless times over the years. They deduce how Doom was able to get past the last test and steal the Vibrainium: Doom was judged by Bast, the panther God of Wakanda, who shows him visions of possible futures that lie in ruin and how Doom believes the only future where humanity is saved is the one where he rules. He believes this completely and his actions and beliefs are deemed pure by the panther God, allowing him to take all the Vibranium.</p><p>A Desturi hit team broke into the palace and took members of the press hostage. Storm and the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> attend to the matter. Storm quickly dispenses the enemies with little effort. In the meantime, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> and T'Challa try to figure out where Doom could have stored the Vibranium.</p><p>T'Challa, Shuri, and the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> head out to <a href=\"/easter-island-rapa-nui/4020-56320/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56320\">Easter Island</a> and run into some <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doombots/4060-59485/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59485\">Doombots</a>, newly enhanced courtesy of Vibranium and Doom's <a href=\"/magic/4015-55759/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55759\">magic</a>. The Doombots get the upper hand, forcing Shuri to switch to her Panther armor. After defeating the Doombots, everyone reconvenes in Wakanda as they plan to hit other Doom factories holding Vibranium. Shuri sends out strike teams around the world to different factories but sustains heavy casualties. T'Challa tells her she's being careless by throwing away lives. She counters by saying he is doing exactly what Doom is expecting him to do. He agrees and decides he must take a different course of action. Reed Richards strongly disagrees but can't convince T'Challa otherwise. At Doom's secure lab, <a href=\"/walter-declun/4005-43751/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43751\">Walter Declun</a> claims Doom should be more concerned that his factories are being taken out. Doom isn't worried claiming that he's already won. On the Latverian border, an old man named Ygor is approached by two officers. They check his bag and find it full of weapons and ammunition. <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a> reveals himself and kills them both and proceeds to the Latverian castle looking for Doom.</p><p>T'Challa sees that their attempts aren't working as he'd hoped, having only recovered 8% of the total Vibranium. They all agree they need to find Doom and stop him if they have any hope at recovering the Vibranium. Back in Doom's lad, Walter Declun reminds Doom not to underestimate his opponents. Doom claims he never underestimates anyone and he's not concerned with the collateral damage he has sustained thus far.</p><p>T'Challa introduces Deadpool to the Dora Milaje he'll be working with. Deadpool finds them attractive and asks if they believe in love at first sight. In the meantime, Reed Richards calls his friend <a href=\"/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">War Machine</a> for help on the situation as well as he's not fully comfortable with Deadpool being involved in the operation. In Mexico, Storm and the Fantastic Four are in a fierce battle with more Doombots and other villains. War Machine arrives in time to assist them and overcome the threat.</p><p>Walter Declun finds out that T'Challa has hacked the system and sent over a billion euros of Doom's money to various charities and foundations. Deadppol teleports into the castle but immediately has his arm cut off. He has to wait for twenty minutes for it to heal before carrying on his mission. Doom finds Deadpool and grabs him by the neck.</p><p>T'Challa informs Shuri and War Machine of his plan to infiltrate Latveria. Doom reveals that with his new armor, he can feel every particle of Vibranium scattered across the world, allowing him to control all things made of metal. The Midnight Angels (small group of Dora Milaje) launch their attack with Deadpool as they attempt to take out Doom. They manage to disrupt his connection to the Vibranium. Deadpool then pulls out a device and hands it to Doom, claiming someone wishes to talk with him. Shuri calls out Doom, telling him to face her, ruler to ruler. Walter Declun tells Doom it's a trap. Doom knows it but heads outside anyways. Once outside, T'Challa asks Doom to stand down in the name of peace and sanity. Doom refuses and begins to attack. Eventually T'Challa gains control of a device in Doom's possession which he uses to turn all the Vibranium in the world inert and completely useless. Reed Richards is shocked that T'Challa would have done that since Wakanda depends on Vibranium. Doom tells T'Challa he's destroyed his people but Shuri counters by saying he's saved them all. Storm then unleashes a lightning storm that takes out all remaining Doombots. Shuri then proceeds by telling Doom she wants nothing more than to kill him. She tells him the war ends here and that if he ever sets foot in Wakanda again, she will hunt him to the ends of the Earth and kill him. The story ends with a shot of a large group of heroes helping the people of Wakanda rebuild their nation.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/doomwar/4050-36499/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-36499\">Doomwar</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nueva-pantera-negra-2/4000-579200/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-579200\">Nueva Pantera Negra #2</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

Written by Titans’ longtime scribe and <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3036\" href=\"/the-new-teen-titans/4050-3036/\" slug=\"the-new-teen-titans\">         New Teen Titans</a> creator <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41478\" href=\"/marv-wolfman/4040-41478/\" slug=\"marv-wolfman\">        Marv Wolfman</a>, the crossover event served to kick off DC’s new series Team Titans. The crossover took place over the course of six issues of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-4014\" href=\"/the-new-titans/4050-4014/\" slug=\"the-new-titans\">       New Titans</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4050-9645\" href=\"/deathstroke-the-terminator/4050-9645/\" slug=\"deathstroke-the-terminator\">      Deathstroke the Terminator</a>, and the first three issues of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-9320\" href=\"/team-titans/4050-9320/\" slug=\"team-titans\">     Team Titans</a>. To help capitalize on the launch of Team Titans, DC also released five versions of Team Titans #1, each one with a different 19 page origin of one of its members. <br/> <br/>While the Team Titans were introduced in the pages of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3454\" href=\"/the-new-teen-titans-annual/4050-3454/\" slug=\"the-new-teen-titans-annual\">    New Teen Titans Annual</a> of the previous year, they were only part of a subplot in the pages of New Titans until the Total Chaos event. With the addition of the reintroduction of the Team Titans, the Total Chaos crossover also highlighted the first appearance of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12890\" href=\"/ravager/4005-12890/\" slug=\"ravager\">   Rose Wilson</a> in the pages of Deathstroke, and new Team Titans member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46853\" href=\"/battalion/4005-46853/\" slug=\"battalion\">  Battalion</a>. ",

While Zod is angry and threatens to take revenge and fight all humans, Superman insists there is hope, and it was only Lex Luthor who was helping to destroy their home planet but not all people on Earth. Zod doesn't agree with Superman, who he believes should be on his side and not side with Earth. Zod orders his minions, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41953\" href=\"/ursa/4005-41953/\" slug=\"ursa\">Ursa</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41954\" href=\"/non/4005-41954/\" slug=\"non\">Non</a>, to kill Superman with a Kryptonian knife but Superman manages to escape.</p><p>Meanwhile <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31100\" href=\"/alura/4005-31100/\" slug=\"alura\">Alura</a> is torturing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48730\" href=\"/reactron/4005-48730/\" slug=\"reactron\">Reactron</a>, who is held captive after the previous events. While <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\" href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" slug=\"supergirl\">Supergirl</a> is afraid of being complicit in a war crime and argue with her mother, Reactron starts laughing about the two arguing. He says he was meant to get caught. Alura notices something is wrong with the prisoner and pushes Supergirl into a containment vessel just in time before Reactron explodes, completely destroying New Krypton.</p><p>Shortly after the explosion General Zod declares war and mobilizes his troops.</p><h4>The Battle for Mars</h4><p>In the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55695\" href=\"/daily-planet/4020-55695/\" slug=\"daily-planet\">Daily Planet</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\" href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" slug=\"lois-lane\">Lois Lane</a> reveals New Krypton is gone. Seconds later, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4704\" href=\"/superwoman/4005-4704/\" slug=\"superwoman\">Superwoman</a> crushes into the newsroom and abducts Lois. Meanwhile Superman and Supergirl escape to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57457\" href=\"/callisto/4020-57457/\" slug=\"callisto\">Callisto</a>, New Krypton's moon, where Supergirl starts crying while telling Superman it's all her fault because she brought Reactron into the prison. Superman tells her it's <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13048\" href=\"/general-sam-lane/4005-13048/\" slug=\"general-sam-lane\">General Lane</a>'s fault because Reactron was one of his man, and Lane played everyone, even Brainiac.</p><p>In space, General Zod sends all Kryptonian troops towards the Earth's Mars Base and Earth itself.</p><p>On Earth, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3213\" href=\"/jimmy-olsen/4005-3213/\" slug=\"jimmy-olsen\">Jimmy Olsen</a> gathers <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\" href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" slug=\"superboy\">Superboy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56092\" href=\"/nightwing-flamebird/4060-56092/\" slug=\"nightwing-flamebird\">Nightwing &amp; Flamebird</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2031\" href=\"/steel/4005-2031/\" slug=\"steel\">Steel</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7644\" href=\"/guardian/4005-7644/\" slug=\"guardian\">Guardian</a> to free <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10019\" href=\"/natasha-irons/4005-10019/\" slug=\"natasha-irons\">Natasha Irons</a> from the military base inside <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56314\" href=\"/mount-rushmore/4020-56314/\" slug=\"mount-rushmore\">Mt. Rushmore</a> and where she is held captive. Inside, General Lane welcomes his 2 daughters, Lois and Lucy. Lois is not amused by her father's actions though General Lane is convinced of doing the right thing.</p><p>On Mars, the battle starts, with Superman and Supergirl fighting alongside the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57075\" href=\"/human-defense-corps/4060-57075/\" slug=\"human-defense-corps\">Human Defense Corps</a> and against their Kryptonian people. Only a few Kryptonians are engaged in the battle while thousand others continue heading towards Earth. Shorty before entering Earth's atmosphere, General Lane orders Lex Luthor to fire a special rocket, that <i>combines the cadaver of a Kryptonian \"God\" with time-pool technology</i> to turn New Krypton's sun into a <i>red sun</i>, thus heavily weakening Superman, Supergirl, and killing thousand of Kryptonians instantly.</p><h4>The Battle for Earth</h4><p>General Lane starts celebrating his success and Earth's victory while the group around Jimmy Olsen and Superboy crashes into the military base to free Natasha. With her information, the group is able to figure out the secret of Lex Luthor's bomb - using the corpse of the false <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45048\" href=\"/rao/4005-45048/\" slug=\"rao\">Rao</a> to change the sun. Flamebird immediately speed towards the <i>red sun</i> where they sacrifice themselves to destroy Rao and restore the sun.</p><p>General Zod, Ursa, and the remaining Kryptonians head towards Metropolis for the final battle. Supergirl and Superman, regaining their powers, rush to defend their adopted home. The Battle for Metropolis begins...</p><h4>The Battle for Survival</h4><p>Superman and Zod clash in Metropolis. Superman refuses to allow Zod to destroy humanity while Zod wants to turn Earth into the new New Krypton.</p><p>Superboy manages to recover the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-42369\" href=\"/phantom-zone-projector/4055-42369/\" slug=\"phantom-zone-projector\">Phantom Zone Projector</a> from the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41185\" href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/\" slug=\"fortress-of-solitude\">Fortress of Solitude</a> and sends Non to the Zone as he attacks the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">Justice League</a>.</p><p>Supergirl defeats Ursa and flies to the military base to confront General Lane willing to kill him and avenge the death of her people. While General Lane says here anger proves him right about Kryptonians he refuses to face judgment and apparently commits suicide.</p><p>When Superboy arrives at Superman's fight with Zod, Superman drags Zod into the Zone with him, willing to sacrifice himself to ensure that Zod is imprisoned for good. In the very last second Nightwing pushes Superman, his adopted father, back and takes his place, so Superman can continue defending Earth while he (Nightwing) remains in the Phantom Zone to ensure his biological father remains trapped, too.</p><h4>Aftermath</h4><p>Lois and Clarke are reflecting about the pointless war. Superman is uncertain if any Kryptonians have survived the war and are hiding somewhere on Earth. Lois is sorry for the Kryptonians' fate and promises to reveal the truth about her father's actions during the war despite the media portraying him as a hero for his 'defensive action', hoping that someday humanity will be ready for interaction with other alien races.</p><p>Note: In a first memo Lois mentions 'they called it \"<b>The Hundred Minute War</b>\" during which both sides suffered terrible losses.</p><h3>Collected Editions</h3><ul><li><a href=\"../../superman-war-of-the-supermen-double-feature-/37-220209/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman: War of the Supermen Double Feature #1</a><br/><span><span>(c</span></span><span><span>ollecting the last 2 issues)</span></span></li><li><a href=\"../../superman-war-of-the-supermen-double-feature-/37-222490/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman: War of the Supermen Double Feature #2</a><br/><span>(collectiing the last 2 issues)</span></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-39017\" href=\"/superman-war-of-the-supermen/4050-39017/\" slug=\"superman-war-of-the-supermen\">Superman: War of The Supermen</a><br/>(TBP/Hardcover collecting issues #0 and #1-4)</li></ul>",

It is only later revealed that Bruce Wayne is still alive and the dead body dragged out by Superman was a perfect clone match created by Darkseid with the assistance of Mokkari and Simyan.</p><p>Now Batman, lost in the past, is struggling to find his way back in the present, jumping into 6 different periods of time, witnessing each of those time's events. Superman, Hal Jordan, Booster Gold, Rip Hunter as well as Skeets, are forming a new team to track him down in the past. Making their first contact with Batman in Vanishing point, Superman warns him that Darkseid booby trapped him when he blasted him with the Omega Effect, turning him into a doomsday device. Therefore, Batman needs the help of the rest of the superhero community to return to the present, because if not, this will mean the destruction of the 21th Century.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-51955\" href=\"/batman-the-return-of-bruce-wayne/4050-51955/\" slug=\"batman-the-return-of-bruce-wayne\">Batman: Return Of Bruce Wayne</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-259584\" href=\"/batman-the-return-of-bruce-wayne-the-deluxe-edition-batman-the-return-of-bruce-wayne-deluxe-edition/4000-259584/\" slug=\"batman-the-return-of-bruce-wayne-the-deluxe-edition-batman-the-return-of-bruce-wayne-deluxe-edition\">Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne - The Deluxe Edition</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-278125\" href=\"/time-masters-vanishing-point-tpb/4000-278125/\" slug=\"time-masters-vanishing-point-tpb\">Time Masters: Vanishing Point</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284906\" href=\"/batman-/4000-284906/\" slug=\"batman-\">Batman #52</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284907\" href=\"/batman-/4000-284907/\" slug=\"batman-\">Batman #53</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-284909\" href=\"/batman-/4000-284909/\" slug=\"batman-\">Batman #55</a></li></ul>",

He also states that so far they have failed to come into contact with the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>, and that Iron Man has been dispatched to investigate the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Mansion</a>.</p><p>At the Mansion, Iron Man finds the entire place abandoned. Meanwhile, Nick Fury has received new intel from the <a href=\"/the-pentagon/4020-55834/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55834\">Pentagon </a>and informs the entire team that the X-Men have allied themselves with the Brotherhood.</p><h3>Part Two</h3><p>In the home of the Greys, Wasp visits Professor Grey. They have a dialogue where he tells her that he trusts <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Xavier</a>, and that he doesn't know anything about the East Coast safehouse that they are reportedly hiding in. In the X-Men's New York safehouse, Professor X speaks to <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert </a>over an intercom and mentions that <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty</a>, and <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine </a>have yet to return from their <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land </a>mission and that communication was lost. <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a>, and <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean </a>get into an argument before the <a href=\"/blackbird/4055-41920/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41920\">X-Jet </a>suddenly returns. But only Kitty and Wolverine exit the jet, and Wolverine tells Jean that Cyclops is dead.</p><p>In the Triskelion, Captain America looks at an image of Wolverine and refers to him as Jim Howlett, stating that they served together back in <a href=\"/world-war-ii/4015-56025/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56025\">WWII</a>. He then mentions that Black Widow and Hawkeye busted a cyber-terrorist attack on the Stock Exchange, and notes that the Brotherhood will now be launching more attacks in the wake of Magneto's return. Stark then explains the mutant-location system he's devised, stating that he's updated Xavier's <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro </a>tracker to locate mutants on a global scale. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver add that all of the Brotherhood bases they were aware of have been vacated, but that there might have been a network of bases that Magneto never told them about. Suddenly, the power in the base goes off. The backup generator kicks in, but that power also goes down.</p><p>Magneto suddenly appears, tearing through the Triskelion's walls. He easily subdues Captain America and Thor. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are too fearful of their own father to attack, and after belittling his children, he then states that he will punish them for turning his Brotherhood into a 'stooge'. Using his powers, he shoots Quicksilver's kneecaps with two rifles. Magneto then tells Captain America that he has erased all Brotherhood intel from the Triskelion's drives. As Magneto leaves, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tells Cap that Xavier has managed to establish communication with the Triskelion in an attempt to broker a deal.</p><p>Captain America tells him that no deals will be made, and that the Ultimates will take the X-Men down along with the Brotherhood.</p><h3>Part Three</h3><p>Somewhere in the U.S.A., Nick Fury brings the President to L.I.N.C.O.L.N. - the Leaders in Need Christian-Only Lockdown Network, a safe haven for every U.S. president since Lincoln's original assassination. The entire town is wired and its residents are all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents tasked with protecting the President from any Brotherhood attempts on his life. As Nick Fury and the President talk, Fury mentions that they've managed to keep Magneto's attack on the Triskelion out of the press and that record numbers of civilians are refusing to go to work in the wake of the Brotherhood reemergence. The President then asks Fury if he can guarantee bringing Xavier in alive (since the X-Men saved his daughter's life before), but Nick Fury says he can't promise this.</p><p>In the Triskelion, Captain America and Wasp are surveying <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Bruce Banner's </a>destroyed cell. During the power outage, the Hulk managed to break out and devour all of the nursing staff before knockout gas disabled him. Captain America then tells Wasp that Fury has known about her mutation since she joined the team, and assures her that they are having a war of terror, not a war on mutants. On the news, reports state that a Brotherhood plot to destroy the Champs Elysees was foiled in Paris, and that Xavier has made a pledge to catch Magneto. In Cleveland, Ohio, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman </a>watches the broadcast as he hides out with his father.</p><p>Back in the X-Men's safehouse, Xavier tells Jean Grey that he plans to negotiate a deal with Magneto. Jean tells the Professor that she suspects Wolverine might have let Cyclops die in order to get with her. Later, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Xavier (along with Kitty, Storm, and Jean ), meet with Magneto (who is accompanied by the psychic <a href=\"/unus/4005-3438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3438\">Unus </a>to hide his identity). Xavier tells Magneto that he is willing to join forces with the Brotherhood, as long as they agree on an appropriate body count as to the execution of the United States and that their old mutant manifesto is used. He gives Magneto time to think about this, and as Magneto and Unus leaves, the entire ruse is revealed. Xavier was in actual fact, using the deal as bait for Wolverine to track Magneto back to his Brotherhood base (Wolverine's <a href=\"/weapon-x/4060-5018/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5018\">Weapon X </a>conditioning protects his mind from telepaths and sensors).</p><p>But as Wolverine tracks them down, it is also revealed that Magneto already knew that Xavier was lying, and that he has leaked the location of the X-Men's safehouse to the authorities. Neuron scrambles are activated to prevent Xavier and Jean from using their telepathic powers, as the <a href=\"/ultimates/4060-40504/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\">Ultimates </a>move in to arrest the X-Men.</p><h3>Part Four</h3><p>In Manhattan, Wolverine is ambushed by S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopters. Wolverine easily disables them all.</p><p>Back in the X-Men's safehouse, Iron Man (after bombarding the safehouse) flies to aid the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents with Wolverine. As the X-Men flee their compromised hideout, Colossus intercepts Iron Man, and begins beating him up. Storm cooks up some thunder, but she is defeated by Thor. Meanwhile, Beast escapes through the safehouse's training area, carrying the Professor on his back. Hawkeye tails them, but Beast activates the training program, forcing Hawkeye to fight against the computer's simulations. Beast and the Professor escape on an emergency plane, but Black Widow manages to hitchhike on it and disables the plane with some explosives. The two mutants eject from the plane, but Iron Man manages to snag their parachutes.</p><p>Suddenly, Wolverine lunges from the top of a building for Iron Man, causing him to crash-land as Xavier and Beast manage to break free. Wolverine then lands onto two S.H.I.E.L.D. troops who were trying to detain Jean and Kitty, and proceeds to tear them up before Captain America appears. Cap reveals that he knew Wolverine during the war, unlocking memories in Wolverine's mind and temporarily confusing him long enough for Captain America to defeat him with a rifle. Meanwhile, Colossus continues beating on Thor before Hawkeye fires a nuclear arrow at the mutant, disabling him.</p><p>Before a S.H.I.E.L.D. sharpshooter can disable Xavier and Beast, Iceman suddenly appears, covering the entire area with a swath of ice, disabling the Ultimates' neural scramblers. Xavier then shuts down every non-mutant mind, buying some time for his students to escape. However, they don't know that Wasp is a mutant, and she manages to sting Xavier, disabling his telepathic assault. Unfortunately, the X-Men have still managed to escape, and only Xavier is detained.</p><p>At the Triskelion, Magneto secretly appears in Xavier's cell and reveals that he was the one who engineered the entire conflict. He tells Xavier that the reason for his plan was to bring the X-Men into the Brotherhood.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/ultimate-x-men-ultimate-war/4050-35610/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35610\">Ultimate X-Men: Ultimate War</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lyudi-iks-51-1/4000-384590/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-384590\">Lyudi Iks #51</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lyudi-iks-52-2/4000-384591/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-384591\">Lyudi Iks #52</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lyudi-iks-53-3/4000-384593/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-384593\">Lyudi Iks #53</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lyudi-iks-54-4/4000-384594/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-384594\">Lyudi Iks #54</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/lyudi-iks-protiv-komandy-ultimates/4050-57077/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-57077\">Lyudi Iks protiv komandy \"Ultimates\"</a> (Russia)</li></ul>",

In the end the vampires are defeated but Jubilee is left as a vampire with her bloodlust barely under control by Wolverine's healing blood.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>The Death of Dracula</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39328/1266190-x4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1266190\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.60380952380952\" data-width=\"525\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 525px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39328/1266190-x4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1266190\"><img alt=\"Xarus stakes Dracula\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39328/1266190-x4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39328/1266190-x4.jpg 525w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39328/1266190-x4.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Xarus stakes Dracula</figcaption></figure><p>The son of <a href=\"/dracula/4005-7206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7206\">Dracula</a> had grown tired of how his father leads the Vampires.

He removed his thick leather jacket, causing his skin to boil before exploding. Pixie was a safe distance away, but Jubilee was covered in his blood. Back on Utopia, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> suspected that there was more to the attack.

Cyclops quickly suspected vampires. While Jubilee's conditioned began to worsen, Dr Nemesis discovered that the virus was manufactured as a means to spread the virus; of which there was no current cure.</p><p>At night, people began to gather in the woods. Those who had been covered in blood were beginning to transform &amp; offer themselves to the vampires. However, the vampires in charge were clearly disappointed that they had not managed to claim Jubilee. Yet on Utopia, Jubilee defiantly sunbathed, fighting her urges to avoid the sun. Although her skin grew pale &amp; her temperature dropped, she insisted on staying in the sun. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a> wanted to be involved due to her personal history with Dracula. Pulling rank, Cyclops forbade her and sent Wolverine instead. Together with, <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a> and Pixie, they uncovered a safe house full of weapons and fresh bodies. They were ambushed by freshly converted vampires, one of which mentioned the 'Lord of the Vampires' who wanted to take over San Francisco. Wolverine's claws could pierce through the heart, but as they weren't made of wood they couldn't kill a vampire. Instead, he was successfully able to decapitate &amp; behead them. From Utopia, Cyclops commanded their immediate return as he intended all the X-Men to be present for a war council.</p><h3>Part Two</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1301384-1279309898.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1301384\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.93236714975845\" data-width=\"621\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 621px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1301384-1279309898.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1301384\"><img alt=\"Jubilee is turned\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1301384-1279309898.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1301384-1279309898.jpg 621w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1301384-1279309898.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jubilee is turned\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1301384-1279309898.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1301384-1279309898.jpg 621w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1301384-1279309898.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jubilee is turned</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a> and <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a> are ordered to capture a vampire alive however the one they try to bring in manages to outrun them since it had a light bending device.

Which means that the two resident thieves, Storm and Gambit, volunteer to steal Dracula’s body. However, their jet is shot down above the island and they only escape due to a mysterious telepathic warning. It becomes quickly clear who is behind the warning: Janus, Dracula’s loyal son who suggests they team up. Within the cavern, they are attacked and Storm is split from the others who discover the body but are attacked by more vampires. Storm finds a vampire circle in a trance, keeping up the shield while automatically feeding on humans. Janus informs her that the only way to drop the shield is kill the vampires which will kill the humans too. Out of options and time, Storm apologizes to the victims and does it. The X-Men teleport in and help their friends take the body while Storm has to deal with the guilt about what she did.</p><h3>Part Three</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68486/1387359-j_l_bite.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1387359\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5531370038412\" data-width=\"781\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 781px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68486/1387359-j_l_bite.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1387359\"><img alt=\"Jubilee turns Wolverine\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68486/1387359-j_l_bite.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68486/1387359-j_l_bite.png 781w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68486/1387359-j_l_bite.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jubilee turns Wolverine\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68486/1387359-j_l_bite.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68486/1387359-j_l_bite.png 781w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68486/1387359-j_l_bite.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jubilee turns Wolverine</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> is seen in the laboratory back at <a href=\"/utopia/4020-56536/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56536\">Utopia</a> with <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-nemesis/4005-29259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29259\">Dr. Nemesis</a> and <a href=\"/dr-kavita-rao/4005-4446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4446\">Dr. Kavita Rao</a>.

Cyclops warns him to consider the facts: that Dracula's dismembered body was in his possession for seventeen hours and seeing he had just \"trojan horsed\" Wolverine on Dracula' son, he should the consider the possibility of Cyclops also having a contingency plan for him.

Armor claims that Jubilee is a threat to their community, and the two young women nearly begin to fight until Wolverine gets involved. He tells Armor to leave his surrogate daughter alone. Jubilee is then sent to Emma Frost's office, where the two discuss her current situation. Emma states that while she doesn't agree with keeping Jubilee around in her present condition, there are many people who care for her and want to help. Asking Jubilee if she wants to discuss college choices, the young vampire retorts with her feelings on how she perceives that everyone on Utopia is afraid of her...and that college is the last thing on her mind. She feels like she is walking around in a daze, constantly on the verge of sleep, afraid to open her mouth because she never knows if she can resist taking a bite of someone. She laments having to constantly rely on Wolverine's blood to dampen her urges. Later on, Pixie decides to take Jubilee outside to see the sunset, since Logan's healing blood allows her to catch mild UV rays. Frustrated with the constant attention she is getting, and wanting some alone time, Jubilee is pushed over the limit when Pixie tries to taunt her into a playful fight. The altercation doesn't last long, as Jubilee uses her superhuman speed to catch up with Pixie seconds after she teleports some distance away, and nearly crushes her with a large boulder.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1632355-kk.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1632355\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.90909090909091\" data-width=\"583\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 583px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1632355-kk.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1632355\"><img alt=\"\"I didn't do it...\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1632355-kk.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60598/1632355-kk.png 583w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60598/1632355-kk.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"I didn't do it...\"</figcaption></figure><p>Shaken by what she nearly did, and feeling the need to escape, Jubilee goes to a bar in San Fransisco, where she has flashbacks of her youth as a mutant, and her first meeting with the X-Men in the mall all those years ago.

Wolverine and Rockslide later find her locked inside a seaside shipping container, along with dozens of dead bodies. Curled up in the fetal position in the corner of the box, covered in blood, Jubilee continuously pleads, \"I didn't do it, I didn't do it, I didn't do it...\" Wolverine then grabs her from the container, ripping an amulet from her neck that the vampire woman had given to her.

Wolverine tells her he knows she was framed for the murders, but also that he still doesn't trust her. He hands her a knapsack containing some clothes for her to change into, including her old trademark yellow coat, then takes her on his motorcycle to the middle of nowhere. He attacks her and starts to fight her, to see what she can do with her new vampiric abilities. Jubilee doesn't want to fight him at first, but after he punches and kicks her she loses her temper and does the same to him, giving as good as she gets. Logan pops his claws to threaten her, but she evades him and destroys his motorcycle in retaliation, forcing him to walk all the way back to town (her super speed ensuring she arrives there long before him). Back at the hotel, and in a calmer mood, the two mend fences and begin to bond again. Logan tells Jubilee some funny secrets he has learned about the other X-Men, and Jubilee states that she learned she can do more back handsprings than <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a>. The two then discuss who could have framed Jubilee for the mass murders in the shipping crate in San Francisco. The two are then approached by the hotel owners, who say that there has been a sudden arrival of zombies in the town. They're killing off the animals, and the people are next. They beg Wolverine and Jubilee to investigate, which they do. Jubilee breaks into an abandoned warehouse and is immediately attacked by a large horde of zombies. Jubilee singlehandedly destroys the zombies with her bare hands, literally tearing them to pieces in a fit of vampiric rage. When the fight is over and the floor of the warehouse is covered in mounds of dead zombies, Wolverine steps from the shadows to survey what Jubilee has done, and asks her if she feels better. Back at the hotel later that night, Wolverine is sleeping when he is awakened by the vampire woman who framed Jubilee for the murders, holding a dazed and beaten Jubilee in her hands.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/deadpool-i-rule-you-suck-deadpool-i-rule-you-suck/4000-267556/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-267556\">Deadpool: I Rule, You Suck</a></li><li><a href=\"/fear-itself-dracula-fear-itself-dracula/4000-323700/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-323700\">Fear Itself: Dracula</a></li><li><a href=\"/namor-the-first-mutant-curse-of-the-mutants-curse-of-the-mutants/4000-263978/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-263978\">Namor the First Mutant: Curse of the Mutants</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-death-of-dracula-the-death-of-dracula/4000-275026/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-275026\">The Death of Dracula</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-curse-of-mutants-tpb/4000-293394/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293394\">X-Men: Curse of the Mutants</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-curse-of-the-mutants-curse-of-the-mutants/4000-264456/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-264456\">X-Men: Curse of the Mutants HC</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-curse-of-the-mutants-x-men-vs-vampires-tpb/4000-293392/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-293392\">X-Men: Curse of the Mutants - X-Men vs. Vampires</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-curse-of-the-mutants-mutants-vs-vampires-x-men-curse-of-the-mutants-mutants-vs-vampires/4000-266432/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-266432\">X-Men: Curse of the Mutants - X-Men vs. Vampires HC</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-curse-of-the-mutants-mutants-vs-vampires/4050-39445/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-39445\">X-Men: Mutants Vs.
