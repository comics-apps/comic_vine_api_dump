The other Young Avengers debate at to the extent they want to get involved - Hulkling wants to help his boyfriend, but Patriot doesn’t think they should be allying themselves with a mutant terrorist. Before they can make their minds up, however, a group of Avengers - including Wolverine - attacks. Wiccan tries to explain that Magneto came for their help, that they are going to find the Scarlet Witch and make things right. This angers Ms Marvel and Wolverine, the latter of whom wants to kill both Wiccan and the Scarlet Witch. As the battle between the Avengers and Young Avengers rages, Wiccan decides to teleport his team and Magneto away - to <a href=\"/wundagore-mountain-transia/4020-41286/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41286\">Transia</a>, leaving the Avengers to formulate their next plan of attack. In Transia, Wiccan disguises everyone in costumes from “the Sound of Music” as they approach the village. <a href=\"/kate-bishop/4005-2262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2262\">Hawkeye</a> and <a href=\"/patriot/4005-2258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2258\">Patriot</a> debate their involvement with Magneto, while the <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a> and <a href=\"/stature/4005-40516/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40516\">Stature</a> discuss what might happen if they find the Scarlet Witch, and she can bring Stature’s father back to life. Magneto locates his wife’s grave and gives the Young Avengers a very brief history lesson, about the birth of the Scarlet Witch and <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a>, before he, Speed and Wiccan join hands around <a href=\"/magda/4005-45372/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45372\">Magda’s</a> grave and try to “reach out” to the Scarlet Witch. Wiccan detects that she is in the village, so Speed races to try and find her - instead he finds a furious Quicksilver, who warns the Young Avengers to leave Transia at once. Wiccan tries to explain that Magneto did not force them to come here, when Quicksilver grabs his supposed nephew and races off. They discuss their situations, before Speed catches up to them and challenges Quicksilver to a race. Quicksilver tells his supposed nephews that he plans to kill Magneto - and grabbing some spiked fence posts he throws them towards Magneto - who suddenly notices a woman in the village who looks like the Scarlet Witch - but she is struck by one of the fence posts - and revealed to be a <a href=\"/doombot/4005-11924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11924\">Doombot.</a></p><h3>Chapter Three</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1506442-wanda.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1506442\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.7585551330798\" data-width=\"526\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 526px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:175.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1506442-wanda.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1506442\"><img alt=\"The real Wanda re-appears\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" data-width=\"526\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1506442-wanda.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1506442-wanda.jpg 526w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The real Wanda re-appears\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1506442-wanda.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1506442-wanda.jpg 526w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" data-width=\"526\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The real Wanda re-appears</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href=\"/wundagore-mountain-transia/4020-41286/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41286\">Transia</a>, Magneto, Quicksilver and the Young Avengers discover that the robot Wanda they encountered is in fact a Doombot. Magneto reveals <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr Doom's</a> origin to the Young Avengers, while they debate whether or not to go to Latveria, where they assume the real Scarlet Witch is being held captive. Later that night, Wiccan attempts to cast a spell to transport him to <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>, when Quicksilver catches him in the act. Quicksilver attempts to bond with his supposed nephew, before Wiccan's teammates arrive, and his boyfriend, Hulkling, is not impressed. Hulkling warns Quicksilver to stay away from Wiccan and not to give him any ideas about going to Latveria. Meanwhile, at the <a href=\"/avengers-tower/4020-40830/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40830\">Avengers Tower</a>, inactive Avenger <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a> has been summoned, as the Avengers believe he, given his closeness to the Scarlet Witch, may have some hope of finding her. Wonder Man is not keen to help the Avengers given the way they blame her for the team mate's own mistakes. But when Wonder Man learns Wolverine wants to kill the Scarlet Witch, he attacks Wolverine, and flies off on his own, announcing he is going to find the Scarlet Witch before Wolverine does. Wiccan cannot sleep, and writes a letter to Hulkling, before transporting himself to Latveria, where, upon landing in the castle grounds, is surrounded by Doombots. Wiccan disguises himself as the Scarlet Witch and claims he got lost. The Doombots take him to the Scarlet Witch's quarters, where the apparent real Wanda attacks Wiccan. He explains to her that he is a super hero and come to rescue her. But when the Scarlet Witch claims she does not know Magneto or Quicksilver, Wiccan deduces that she has amnesia, or is faking it. But Wiccan gets another shock when the Scarlet Witch reveals that she is getting married tomorrow - and Dr Doom appears, announcing that the Scarlet Witch is getting married to him.</p><h3>Chapter Four</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1606696\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6114864864865\" data-width=\"1184\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1184px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:161.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1606696\"><img alt=\"Iron Lad returns\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg 1184w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg 595w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Lad returns\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg 1184w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1606696-iron_lad.jpg 595w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Lad returns</figcaption></figure><p>Wiccan battles Doctor Doom as he believes Wanda is under his control. Doom assures Wiccan that she is not, and claims he has been trying to protect everyone. Wiccan tries to trigger Wanda’s memory by telling her about the Scarlet Witch, the Vision and her sons, but Doom takes Wiccan out with a powerful blast. Wanda is surprised by Doom’s actions and Doom tells her that it is not too late to reconsider their marriage tomorrow. The next morning, Magneto, Quicksilver and the rest of the Young Avengers arrive near Doom’s castle, planning to rescue Wanda and Wiccan. But they notice a fleet of ships in the sky - and Wonder Man, who has just arrived. The Avengers - Captain America, Iron Man, Ms Marvel, Spider-Man and Luke Cage arrive as well, having tracked the ionic signature of their former teammate. Doom revives Wiccan and informs him that Wanda came to him, asking for his help on behalf of her people, and that he found himself unable to refuse her. Doom and Wiccan discuss the situation and Doom points out the similarities between himself and Wiccan, before offering him protection here, to stay as his guest - otherwise his prisoner, before informing Wiccan that when he healed him, he took away his powers.</p><p>Outside, Magneto has attacked the ships, enabling the Young Avengers the distraction they need - but as they make their plan to enter the castle, the Avengers and Wonder Man appear. Inside, the Scarlet Witch locates Wiccan, who is chanting that he wants his powers back. Dressed in her wedding dress, Wanda tells Wiccan that everything here has been too perfect, and that she wants to know about the Scarlet Witch. Wiccan agrees to tell her what he knows, provided she gets him out of here. They make their way through a tunnel, as Wiccan tells Wanda about her and the Vision, their children, <a href=\"/master-pandemonium/4005-7229/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7229\">Master Pandemonium</a>, the “ <a href=\"/avengers-disassembled/4045-43625/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43625\">Disassembled</a>” fiasco, and about how he joined the Young Avengers and met his apparent twin brother. But as they make their way outside, they find Doom and his Doombots involved in a full scale war with Magneto, the Avengers and Young Avengers. Before they have time to act though, Wolverine appears and captures Wanda, ready to kill her. Wiccan explains that Wanda has no powers and no memory, that she is not a threat to anyone. Wolverine reminds Wanda about “No More Mutants”, and prepares to kill her - before he is blasted away by <a href=\"/iron-lad/4005-2263/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2263\">Iron Lad,</a> who announces that he is here to protect Wiccan as the future depends on it!</p><h3>Interlude</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1724083-futures003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1724083\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.76142697881828\" data-width=\"897\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 897px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1724083-futures003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1724083\"><img alt=\"Iron Lad battles Kang in the future\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 897px) 100vw, 897px\" data-width=\"897\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1724083-futures003.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1724083-futures003.jpg 897w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1724083-futures003.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Lad battles Kang in the future\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1724083-futures003.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1724083-futures003.jpg 897w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1724083-futures003.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 897px) 100vw, 897px\" data-width=\"897\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Lad battles Kang in the future</figcaption></figure><p>In the far future, Iron Lad is battling his future self, <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\">Kang the Conqueror</a> on the planet Moord. Iron Lad is continuing his mission to prevent himself from becoming Kang and defeating Kang's schemes, but Kang insists that no matter what he does, everything will lead to him becoming his true future self. Suddenly a group of Avengers shows up, except these are the Young Avengers grown up: Vision, Kate Bishop (Hawkeye), Cassie Lang (Stinger), Ted (as Captain Marvel), Eli (as Captain America), Samantha Wilson Bradley (Falcon), Steve Wilson Bradley (Bucky) and Tom Shepherd (Quicksilver). In this future, this Kang is a member of the Avengers, Tom and Kate are an item, as are Kang and Cassie. They reveal that the other 'real' Avengers are searching the timestream for them to kill them, because of what they are doing, killing whole populations of aliens like the <a href=\"/badoon/4060-22907/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22907\">Badoon</a>. Nathaniel (Iron Lad) tries to convince them that they are not following their original founding principles and thinks back on the incident that started their career. In the past we see that Iron Lad wanted to defeat Kang and was training Wiccan, Eli and Ted in a specially built hologram training room. But when Kang appears in the simulation, Nathaniel freezes in fear and Wiccan and Ted have to finish the program. The four take a break and go out for the night. Seeing Kate Bishop on the phone arranging the rehearsal dinner for the wedding that will eventually lead to her joining the team, they dare each other to talk to her but fail. Suddenly they see lightning, but discover that <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a> is responsible. Electro is in the process of killing bystanders and breaking stuff. The four heroes attack him but struggle to defeat him. Iron Lad is able to absorb Electro's energy causing an explosion that knocks Electro down. Momentarily impressed with their victory, the guys are taken by surprise when Electro revives and takes them out. They regroup and defeat him finally. Back in the future scene, Iron Lad tries to convince the team that as the Young Avengers they intervened to save and protect others, but they remind him that Electro subsequently broke out villains from the <a href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">Raft</a> in the <a href=\"/new-avengers-breakout/4045-55505/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55505\">Breakout</a>. He counters by stating that this incident resulted in the formation of the <a href=\"/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\">New Avengers</a>. Kang tells him that those Avengers eventually decided they should eliminate all who stood in their way, including killing Scarlet Witch and Wiccan in Latveria. Kang claims <i>he</i> saved the remaining Young Avengers from death by traveling back in time to save them in Latveria. At that, Iron Lad decides to travel back in time to intervene in the fight between the Young Avengers and the adult Avengers, to save Wiccan and Wanda himself. After he disappears into the timestream, Wiccan appears and tells Kang he didn't have to lie to Nathaniel. Kang is unperturbed by this, as his words had the desired effect of sending Iron Lad back in time to begin the chain of events that will lead to him becoming Kang and destroying the Avengers.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/avengers-the-childrens-crusade-avengers-the-childrens-crusade/4000-321759/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-321759\">Avengers: The Children's Crusade</a></li><li><a href=\"/uncanny-x-men-the-birth-of-generation-hope/4050-37478/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37478\">Uncanny X-Men: The Birth of Generation Hope</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/avengers-assemble-the-childrens-crusade/4000-355050/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-355050\">Avengers Assemble #7</a></li><li><a href=\"/avengers-assemble-the-bride-of-doom/4000-355049/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-355049\">Avengers Assemble #8</a></li><li><a href=\"/avengers-assemble-9/4000-355048/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-355048\">Avengers Assemble #9</a></li><li><a href=\"/avengers-assemble-10/4000-362553/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-362553\">Avengers Assemble #10</a></li></ul>",

Once they all found themselves in Wenchester county at a school owned by <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor Charles Xavier</a> who founded the building for gifted youngsters as he calls it.They first met <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Scott Summer</a>s aka. Cyclops who gave them uniforms and codnames so the Sentinels could not detect them.Ororo became Storm, Hank Beast and Piotr Colossus. After the introduction, Prof. Xavier told them that Erik Lansher once was his friend who betrayed him and became Magneto.Not much later Xavier used a special device nicknamed <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a> to located another mutants, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Bobby Drake</a>. The young Drake was in NYC, Time Square chased by six Sentinels and the X-Men, how they called themselves, defeated all five giving the final shot to Bobby who destroyed the last one of the robots.Although ended up victorious, the people didn't liked them and they had no other option but to flee.</p><p>Elsewhere at a place called <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a>, Magneto and his brotherhood, <a href=\"/toad/4005-1470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1470\">Toad</a>, <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> and <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> are talking about Xavier and finally Magneto reveals his plan that he sent someone after Xavier.

As soon as they both were in open area, John was killed and Wolverine captured by unknown persons.Meanwhile the X-Men is on their way to help and recruit Wolverine because as the prof. said , it's better to have him on their side than vica versa.Logan woke up on an adamantium cell only to realize that his attacker was non other than <a href=\"/john-wraith/4005-3205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3205\">John Wraith</a>, the one who \"made\" him. After torturing him,the X-Men arrived and saved Logan who wanted to kill ultimately John for what he did, but Jean managed to calm him down. Wolverine than joined the X-Men.At the savage land, Quicksilver and Vanda are suspicious about this and Magneto revealed that he was the one who informed the Weapon X about Logan so things can look more real when the X-Men arrive.</p><p>Days later, Bobby,Peter and Ororo are out shopping when a bunch of Sentinels arrived to arrest mutants and thanks to their uniform, their mutant DNA is hidden so they look normal. Same time, Wolverine is training in the Danger Room where he managed to kill all the X-Men members.After the training Jean and Prof. X both tried to read Logan's mind but with no success due Logan's weapon X training which helped him keep his thought blocked.Cyclops although didn't trust him, he allowed him to go with them on a mission to Croatia to save the president's daughter who have been kidnapped by the Brotherhood and Magneto.</p><p>Arriving there they managed to save the girl and bring her home successuly but that almost cost Beast's life.Quicksilver was</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55287/1297272-ultimatex_men4_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1297272\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5303983228512\" data-width=\"477\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 477px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55287/1297272-ultimatex_men4_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1297272\"><img alt=\"\"I don't trust you...\"\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55287/1297272-ultimatex_men4_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55287/1297272-ultimatex_men4_2.jpg 477w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px\" data-width=\"477\"></a><figcaption>\"I don't trust you...\"</figcaption></figure><p>although hurt by Logan and told Magneto who arrived and let the X-Men go for an unknown reason, that maybe Logan turned on them but Magneto assured his son that if he's late it's only because Logan first wants to sleep with a girl from the team.</p><p>Back at the X Mansion, Jean tried out a new serum on Beast which turned his hair blue and than went to a walk with Logan at the rose garden where she told Logan that he doesn't trusts her and suddenly they started making out where Cyclops saw them. Scott than became jealous and left the mansion.He went to the savage land where Magneto was standing and told him that he was right and he came to join the Brotherhood. Magneto greeted him as 'brother Cyclops'.</p><p>Same midnight, the Brotherhood now with Cyclops in command caused havoc in London killing many people. Cyclops didn't kept a secret he disagrees with the way the brotherhood took this \"warning message\".

Cyclops than managed to get Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch on his side and called Professor X to inform him that they have a ''little problem\".</p><p>The invasion began and Magneto now with an army of Sentinels attacked the White House and the whole Washington and the X-Men began fighting them while Professor X warned telepathically the people of the city to get out from there.</p><p>Meantime, Jean and Wolverine are fighting.Jean telekinetically throw Wolverine to the wall after founding out that Wolverine entered the team only to kill the professor for Magneto. Wolverine told Jean that he confessed this because now he is on their side and will stop Magneto.</p><p>At the White House, the President is naked on the ground while Magneto holds the flag of the United States of America and told the people that today is the day when homo sapiens fall and homo superior will take control of Earth. Magneto then tries to murder the president when Professor X arrived and the two began fighting telekinetically.Wolverine showed up and proved to be on the X-Men's side stabbing several times Magneto with his adamantium claws. Magneto managed to hit Wolverine with an iron piece and tried to bring down the White House while Logan was lying on the ground unconscious. Not knowing how to stop him, Quicksilver took his father's helmet which stopped Xavier from entering Magneto's mind with his giving an opportunity to end this once and for all. Now being on his old friend's mind, Charles Xavier doubled his friend's power transforming him into an electric force field summoning everything that's made of metal to 'him' with this causing a big explosion above Washington apparantely killing Magneto.</p><p>Back to the Xavier Institute for Gifted Children, Xavier is having a conversation with Cyclops and told him that no matter what he did he is proud of him because ultimately he choose the good side in this fight and in the end that is only what matters. When asking what will happen to Wolverine, Xavier told Scott that like him, Wolverine proved them that he is fighting the good fight too and next they he will help Logan tracking down John Wraith and those who made him Wolverine the way he is and erased his memory at the Weapon X project. Outside Cyclops and Charles sit down for a champagne and Xavier told Scott that this was only plan one and the second one will be much more interesting...</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/ultimate-x-men-the-tomorrow-people/4050-35595/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35595\">Ultimate X-Men: The Tomorrow People</a></li><li><a href=\"/ultimate-x-men-ultimate-collection-volume-1/4000-168644/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-168644\">Ultimate X-Men: Ultimate Collection Vol. 1</a></li><li>100 Greatest Marvels of All Time <a href=\"/the-100-greatest-marvels-of-all-time-13-10/4000-133636/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-133636\">#4</a></li></ul><h3>Foreign Reprints</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lyudi-iks-1-1/4000-384479/\">Lyudi Iks #1 - Люди будущего.

Fury</a> is searching for the weapon X as well when he was attacked, he took them down really fast but something arrived and his men lost contact with him. <br/><br/>At the Weapon X facility, John Wraith was talking to his bosses and told them that the X-Men are now part of his S.H.I.E.L.D. team.<br/> At their cells later, Cyclops told Juggernaut that he already has three escape plans and once the president of the United States finds out that they kidnapped them, they will come and take the whole program down. <br/><br/>At Nightcrawler's mind, Jean is having a conversation with the mutant and told him that everything's going to be just alright. <br/> <br/>At the time Beast was transformed into a blue skinned mutant thanks to the experiments Dr.Cornelius was making on him. <br/>     Next morning the newly assigned S.H.I.E.L.D. team was sent on a mission to rescue Colonel Fury but before they started, Sabretooth informed him that if they're planning everything fancy the nanobots in their heads will be activated to blow their brains out. <br/><br/>At the laboratory, John Wraith is desperate to find Wolverine so he began using Cerebro. <br/><br/>The X-Men team successfully saved Fury but with a great cost.Jean had to kill someone in order to have the mission done.  <br/> <br/>Back at their cells, Bobby lost faith but Colossus told him that Wolverine will come and save them.Sabretooth arrived and told them to stop believing in 'angels' because they've just captured Wolverine at St. Petersburg.  <br/><br/>In a flashback it turned out that Wolverine and Fury go way back and Wolverine once saved him and since then they were like friends. <br/><br/>In New York, Fury is thinking about saving the X-Men from John Wraith after an annonymus source he got informed.

Wolverine about what she said earlier but Wolverine told her that they haven't 'captured' him because it was just all part of a bigger plan to get them out of there. <br/><br/>When John's bosses ordered him to shut down the facility, John killed them while Wolverine was dragged out by Sabretooth to show him the files which contained Wolverine's life before the Weapon X and burned it all in front of Wolverine than they shoot him and Sabretooth began torturing him by telling him that he was the one who killed Wolverine's wife and kid.Suddenly all lights go out as the X-Men realize that

    "deck": "Dr. Hurt returns to execute his revenge on the dynamic duo. If Doctor Hurt almost got the best of Bruce, will Dick and Damian be able to survive?",
    "description": "<p>Batman and Robin Must Die opens up with an iconic image that is slightly different than the one that everyone is accustomed to. It features Thomas Wayne as the surviving member of the Wayne family in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55715\" href=\"/crime-alley/4020-55715/\" slug=\"crime-alley\">alley</a> where his family was killed. This scene is all in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54826\" href=\"/doctor-hurt/4005-54826/\" slug=\"doctor-hurt\">Hurt'</a>s head, as he announces to Gotham that he is Thomas Wayne at a news conference. Hurt heads to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55767\" href=\"/wayne-manor/4020-55767/\" slug=\"wayne-manor\">Wayne Manor</a> where <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56496\" href=\"/the-dynamic-duo/4060-56496/\" slug=\"the-dynamic-duo\">Batman and Robin</a> are subdued. He taunts <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\" href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" slug=\"dick-grayson\">Dick Grayson</a> and apparently shoots him in the head as Damian looks on in shock. Three days earlier, Robin arrives at the scene where Batman is questioning the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\" href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" slug=\"joker\">Joker</a>. He informs the Joker that he knew who he was. The clues that were left at crime scenes, such as the Domino's were a giveaway that whoever left them knew that he was once Robin. The domino's represented the Domino mask that Dick once wore as both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\" href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" slug=\"robin\">Robin</a> and Nightwing . Gordon stops the interrogation and eventually leaves with Batman to the Bat-Bunker. On the way there they converse about the changes around Gotham, and how his men prefer him to the old Batman. Robin remains behind with the Police and the Joker. While in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56723\" href=\"/batbunker/4020-56723/\" slug=\"batbunker\">Bat-Bunker</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\" href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" slug=\"james-gordon\">Gordon</a> learns that the Joker has asked for Robin. Batman warns that that would be a mistake. Robin begins questioning the Joker, who notes that he sounds like the Batman. Robin beats the Joker with a crowbar. Batman and Gordon race to the Police Station but are hit with a rocket launcher. The <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\" href=\"/batmobile/4055-41463/\" slug=\"batmobile\">Batmobile</a> crashes and leaves Gordon with an unconscious Batman, while <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62628\" href=\"/pyg/4005-62628/\" slug=\"pyg\">Professor Pyg</a> is set free.</p><p>Robin, back at the police headquarters, continues to beat the Joker with a crowbar. During this the Joker just laughs and states that he likes this Robin. In a nod towards the death of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\" href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" slug=\"jason-todd\">Jason Todd</a>, the Joker makes a joke about bringing his own crowbar. The Joker somehow causes Robin to be poisoned by his Joker Toxin and makes for an escape. Pyg and Hurt converse as Hurt looks upon the Bat Box, noting he can't open it without destroying what's inside. Meanwhile Gordon is doing his best to protect Batman as they get swarmed by Pyg's people. The Batmobile begins to self destruct although he tries to override the process. Dick awakens beneath <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56461\" href=\"/wayne-enterprise/4020-56461/\" slug=\"wayne-enterprise\">Wayne Towe</a>r with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5556\" href=\"/alfred/4005-5556/\" slug=\"alfred\">Alfred</a> tending to his condition. Batman tries to call Robin but the Joker answers instead. Joker wants Black Glove and as result has Batman and Robin working for him. Alfred mentions preparing the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-31340\" href=\"/batcave/4020-31340/\" slug=\"batcave\">cave</a> and mansion as per Dick's request. Gordon has been taken by Pyg and Hurt and Batman goes after him. Gordon tells Batman not to untie him, but does so and knocks Batman out. Hurt taunts Joker, who is still holding Damian laughs, saying it's much too serious for him. He appears ready to release <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\" href=\"/damian-wayne/4005-42413/\" slug=\"damian-wayne\">Damian</a> into this \"game.\"</p><p>Joker opens up a coffin with Robin inside, still alive. Hurt, meanwhile arrives at the Manor where Alfred apparently has been waiting. The city appears to be in mass chaos and Hurt takes advantage of this. Joker takes Robin and leads him towards the Manor. Robin attempts to break free and states he's only doing this for Batman. Robin is set loose and finds Gordon who has fought off whatever made him attack Batman. Robin tells him to take control of the city. Damian fights off a lot of attackers, but in the end is captured. He tells Batman he is sorry there were too many. We arrive at where the arc started, Hurt shooting Dick. He reveals that the bullet will not pass through his skull, instead, if left untreated it will cause a hematoma, he will be in a coma in less than twelve hours. He tempts Damian, saying that he can save Dick, but it will come at a price. Damian reveals that they know who Hurt really is, and that he shouldn't have returned. He reveals he did know Thomas and Martha Wayne. He intends to ruin the Legacy of the Wayne Family. He tempts Damian again, showing him the box and starts a ceremony of the Bat. Dick tells him to stall. A whistle is heard and it opens the box. Inside is written one word on a piece of paper. \"Gotcha!\" Dick and Damian punch Hurt and they reveal that this was a trap all along. A figure is shown in the shadows as Dick tells Hurt \"Devil...Meet Bat-God.\"</p><p>The conclusion of the arc begins in 1765 in the middle of what appears to be some sort of ritual. A man, resembling Hurt goes apparently eats a bat and something changes in him as he talks with a creature that seems to be hinted at being <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\" href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" slug=\"darkseid\">Darkseid.</a> The time shifts to the present, showing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" slug=\"batman\">The Batman</a> facing off against Hurt. Dick and Damian stand next to Batman, there are now two Batmen and a Robin. Damian questions if Bruce is a robot but they say they will talk about it later. The three fight off what appears to be an endless horde of attackers. Amidst the fighting Bruce questions why Dick is wearing the costume. Dick tells him that he had to because Jason Todd was masquerading as Batman. Bruce says they'll talk about his trip through time when they have some time. They deal with the swarm and Bruce asks him what they're dealing with. They let him know about what's going on and Bruce tells Dick he needs medical attention as soon as he can. Hurt is revealed to be Thomas Wayne, just not <i>THE</i> Thomas Wayne. He's from 1765 and the \"black sheep\" of the Wayne Family. Before sending Dick and Damian off, Bruce tells Damian he was proud of him and the choices he made. Hurt traps him in a tank that rises with water. Hurt tells him he'll never get out. \"Batman R.I.P. Rot in Purgatory.\" Batman and Robin are going after Pyg, Damian pleads with him to stop and get medical attention. Pyg is brought into custody by Gordon. Hurt tries to reach \"Barbatos\" but his head is slammed into a mirror by Bruce. Hurt gives Bruce a choice, go after him or save Alfred. Batman saves Alfred while Hurt escapes, but is soon apprehended by the Joker, who buries Hurt alive. Batman later captures the Joker. Bruce see's to Dick and Damian. He tells Dick he is to be inactive for two months, Dick says something about Nightwing, but Bruce brushes it off. Damian asks what will happen to Batman and Robin. Bruce tells him \"Batman and Robin will never die.\" Together, as a family Dick, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\" href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" slug=\"tim-drake\">Tim</a>, Damian, and Alfred accompany Bruce Wayne to a press conference where he reveals that he has been funding Batman and that he plans on expanding the franchise globally. <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56286\" href=\"/batman-incorporated/4045-56286/\" slug=\"batman-incorporated\">Batman Inc</a>.. begins.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-51954\" href=\"/batman-and-robin-batman-and-robin-must-die/4050-51954/\" slug=\"batman-and-robin-batman-and-robin-must-die\">Batman and Robin: Batman and Robin Must Die!</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-246325\" href=\"/batman-and-robin-the-deluxe-edition-batman-and-robin-must-die/4000-246325/\" slug=\"batman-and-robin-the-deluxe-edition-batman-and-robin-must-die\">Batman and Robin: The Deluxe Edition Vol. 3</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Background</h2><p>Wary of the disaster that had befallen <a data-ref-id=\"4020-30670\" href=\"/krypton/4020-30670/\" slug=\"krypton\">Krypton</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a> created an alternate reality that was meant to serve as a refuge for the citizens of Earth in case of such a calamity. However, he eventually came to realize that he no right to interfere with the destiny of the Earth in such a manner, and abandoned the reality inside the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\" href=\"/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\" slug=\"phantom-zone\">Phantom Zone</a>, subsequently erasing his own memory of having created it.</p><p>While circling over Metropolis and keeping a watch on crime, Superman hears a cry for help from outer space and rushes to the rescue of his friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\" href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" slug=\"kyle-rayner\">Kyle Rayner</a>. When he returns to Earth, however, he finds that a million of its denizens have mysteriously disappeared, leaving no trace (an event that the media dubs \"The Vanishing\") . <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\" href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" slug=\"lois-lane\">Lois</a> is one of these people, and Superman struggles to overcome his guilt over not being able to save her or any of the others.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Attempting to cope with his guilt, Superman visits <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4114\" href=\"/father-daniel-leone/4005-4114/\" slug=\"father-daniel-leone\">Daniel Leone</a>, a priest suffering from cancer, in a series of confessionals that tell the story in media res. He comes to trust Leone and tells him how he traced the source of The Vanishing to a unnamed Middle Eastern country. Flying into a war zone, he quickly eliminates all the weapons from one side, and goes to face General Nox, a military leader attempting a coup d'etat in the country. Nox refuses to back away and unleashes a cybernetic minion called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46916\" href=\"/equus/4005-46916/\" slug=\"equus\">Equus</a>, whose claws were sharp enough to cut Superman's skin. In the ensuing fight, Equus is injured and activates the Vanishing Device, which vanishes himself, Nox and a further 300,000 inhabitants of Earth.</p><p>With the Vanishing Device secured, Superman and Leone fly to the Fortress Of Solitude, where they attempt to reverse-engineer the device in the hope of vanishing Superman to wherever the missing people went so he can attempt a rescue. Before they can carry out the scheme, however, they are confronted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" slug=\"wonder-woman\">Wonder Woman</a>, who refuses to let them proceed. She argues that Superman has no idea where the device might lead, which makes his task a potential suicide mission. Superman refuses to listen to her and the two come to blows. Just then, a mysterious mercenary named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46915\" href=\"/mr-orr/4005-46915/\" slug=\"mr-orr\">Mr. Orr</a> enters the Fortress. He tells the heroes and Leone that he works for a group of individuals so powerful that \"80% of the world's population work for them in one way or another\". In the midst of the fight, Superman tells Diana that the Fortress is set to self-destruct, and she can either keep fighting him or save Orr and Leone. She flies them away to safety, while Superman activates the Vanishing Device. It transports him to Metropia, the alternate reality he had abandoned in the Phantom Zone.</p><p>In Metropia, Lois and Clark are reunited. It is revealed that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13075\" href=\"/general-zod/4005-13075/\" slug=\"general-zod\">Zod</a> was behind the first Vanishing, as he intended to create an empire for himself in Metropia. Equus is also working for him now. Superman attacks the duo and succeeds in defeating them after a long battle. He sends all the victims of The Vanishing back to Earth and initiates the permanent destruction of Metropia. In the dying reality's last moments, Superman tries to save Zod, but Zod refuses to accept help from him.</p><p>In the background of these events, it is revealed that Orr and Leone have met in the recent past. Orr knew about Leone's cancer and told him he had a cure for it. The cure turns out to be a mutating agent that transforms Leone into Pilate, an enhanced version of Equus. Leone begs Superman to put him out of his misery, but Superman refuses, horrified at the request. Just then, Superman is attacked by the released Equus. Leone lunges at the beast and drags him down to a fiery nova, where they both disappear.</p><p>In the aftermath of the rescue, Superman begins the construction of a new Fortress in a rainforest. He thinks about all he has saved over the years, and wonders who will save him when the time comes.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-37755\" href=\"/absolute-superman-for-tomorrow/4050-37755/\" slug=\"absolute-superman-for-tomorrow\">Absolute Superman for Tomorrow</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-250715\" href=\"/superman-for-tomorrow-for-tomorrow-vol-1/4000-250715/\" slug=\"superman-for-tomorrow-for-tomorrow-vol-1\">Superman: For Tomorrow Vol. 1</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-250716\" href=\"/superman-for-tomorrow-for-tomorrow-vol-2/4000-250716/\" slug=\"superman-for-tomorrow-for-tomorrow-vol-2\">Superman: For Tomorrow Vol. 2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-56880\" href=\"/superman-for-tomorrow/4050-56880/\" slug=\"superman-for-tomorrow\">Superman: For Tomorrow</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-250100\" href=\"/dc-universe-presents-/4000-250100/\" slug=\"dc-universe-presents-\">DC Universe Presents #1</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>Although the actual-titled Necropolis story ran for 26 issues, it was in fact part of a Democracy storyline which began four years previously. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30061\" href=\"/judge-dredd/4005-30061/\" slug=\"judge-dredd\">Dredd</a> had defended the Judicial system he represents from democratic marches, although he became disillusioned due to the underhand tactics the Judges used to stem the marches. <br/>Three years after the marches, Dredd finds a letter, addressed to him, from the body of a young boy, who was murdered. The letter, although written with naivety, highlighted several problems with the Judicial system which Dredd was already aware of, and concerned about, and ultimately felt responsible for the boy's murder, as he was en route to post the letter when he was murdered. <br/> <br/>Kraken, a clone of Dredd, but was previously under Judda influenced, was rehabilitated and due to be assessed by Dredd for his full Judge assessment. Despite performing in his exam impeccably, even helping Dredd to remain calm when his mentor, and own assessor, Judge Morphy, was murdered, Dredd failed Kraken, proclaiming 'A leopard can't change his spots. Not this one, anyway.' In the same moment, Dredd also resigned effectively immediately, and requested to take the long walk.   </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74010/1369961-nec1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1369961\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3793103448276\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74010/1369961-nec1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1369961\"><img alt=\"The real Dredd, on the right, and the 'Imposter' Kraken, on the left\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74010/1369961-nec1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74010/1369961-nec1.jpg 232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px\" data-width=\"232\"></a><figcaption>The real Dredd, on the right, and the 'Imposter' Kraken, on the left</figcaption></figure><br/> <br/>After Dredd left, Chief Judge Silver faked Kraken's death, and kept Dredd's resignation secret from the public, to instil Kraken as a replacement for Dredd, regardless of his failed assessment by the departed Dredd. Kraken was easily manipulated by the Sisters of Death, who had attacked and left Dredd for dead in the Cursed Earth in The Dead Man saga, to bring about the Dark Judges; Judge Death, Mortis, Fire and Fear. They would go on to wreak havoc in Mega City One, creating their own Necropolis, with life the ultimate crime. Kraken was also made a dark judge for the duration of the Dark Judges' reign. <br/> <br/>Dredd, who had regained his memory, returned from the Cursed Earth along with ex-Chief Judge McGruder, as Dredd felt that something was wrong with the city he once served. The dark judges had soon taken control of the remaining judges, who were now executing citizens, often committing suicide or succumbing to disease or starvation.  Dredd and McGruder met with a group of cadets who were in hiding from the dark judges, along with PSI Judge Anderson, and a plan of action was formed. Firstly, Dredd killed fellow judge Kit Agee, who had been used as a psychic bridge for the dark judges to return. This caused the remaining judges to return to normal, free of the Sisters of Death's control.  <br/> <br/>With the judges now together and able to form a unit, they began to capture the dark judges. All but Death himself were captured, who had flung himself from a city block down into the city bottom, and vanished among the sixty million dead from the dark judges' tenure.  <br/> <br/>Judge Kraken, now free of Death's control, accepted his execution at the hands of Dredd. <br/> <br/>Among the chaos of the dark judges' reign, Chief Judge Silver was killed and then reanimated as a zombie. ",

    "deck": "Following World War Hulks, the Hulk and his extended family must face his other son, Hiro Kala.",
    "description": "<p>Banner, Betty Ross, Skaar, Korg, <a href=\"/savage-she-hulk/4005-27405/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27405\">Lyra</a>, Jen Walters, and A-Bomb (Rick Jones) had hidden themselves out on a beach in Dry Tortugas, Florida, even though national media had recognized them as the heroes of the <a href=\"/aimarines/4060-57517/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57517\">AIMarines</a> disaster in Washington D.C. Bruce approached Betty, trying to rekindle their estranged relationship, but only succeeded in angering her - causing her to transform into the Red She-Hulk. Immediately, she jumped several miles away, causing a good deal of destruction and alerting the authorities as to their whereabouts. After a short scuffle, Banner transformed into the Hulk and chased off after Betty. The two fought for a brief time, leaving Skaar in the care of Korg and A-Bomb. Skaar began to sense something amiss (at the exact same time as Amadeus Cho, Reed Richards, Tony Stark and Beast), and informed Korg and A-Bomb that he must find his father. They told him to leave 'mommy and daddy' alone while they fought, but Skaar was insistent, and quite upset.</p><p>Hulk continued to battle Red She-Hulk, trying to calm her down so he could talk to her, but she believed that it was Bruce, still trying to talk to Betty. Hulk told her that he only wanted her to stop causing so much damage because it put his son, Skaar, in danger by drawing attention. Hulk was convinced that Skaar was changed and didn't want him to grow to be like he and the other 'angry' Hulks. As the two continued to brawl, a wave caught Skaar (who had remained in his puny form since his fight with Hulk), but he was saved by Red She-Hulk. At this moment Steve Rogers and Amadeus Cho appeared behind Hulk, informing him that they needed to talk. Hulk tried to push Rogers away, but Rogers and Cho were only projections. They informed him that the planet K'ai ( <a href=\"/jarella/4005-12068/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12068\">Jarella</a>'s world) had just appeared on the edge of the solar system and that Rogers had only been given a 48-hour window to intervene before the government's intercept-fleet did. Hulk distrusted the idea of anyone shipping him anywhere in a space ship, for obvious reasons, but it was the pleading of Skaar that convinced Hulk to decline. He promptly smashed the ship that Rogers brought along. Hulk asked Skaar what he had to say, and Skaar whispered into his ear the truth: the second Son of Hulk was on his way to earth.</p><p>As Rogers and his Secret Avengers prepared to launch their fleet of interception crafts toward the incoming planet K'ai, the Hulk showed up and began destroying the fleet. The Secret Avengers opened up on Hulk and seemingly disabled him. As War Machine began to place some rather enormous cuffs on him, Hulk revealed that he was only leading them on, and the rest of the Hulks (She-Hulk, Red She-Hulk, A-Bomb, Skaar, and Korg) burst from the ground. Earlier that day, Hulk had Skaar training and focusing his Old-Power in an attempt to get a read on Hiro-Kala's position in the skies. As the other members of the Hulk family distracted the Secret Avengers, Skaar made his way to a 'repair bay'. Seeing him as no threat, Rogers let him go. Hulk powered down, telling Rogers and his team that he had just saved all their lives and the lives of a hundred other astronauts on their way to intercept his son. Bruce told Steve that if he went up there, Hiro-Kala would kill him. Or that Rogers would be forced to kill Hiro-Kala, then the Hulk would have to kill Rogers.</p><p>During this time Skaar had been repowering the Sakaarian Stone Flagship that Hulk and his Warbound had brought to Earth to wage war on its heroes. The Flagship rose from the hangar and the Hulks escaped into space, headed toward the incoming planet K'ai. Upon nearing K'ai the group noticed that the planet itself was surrounded by spacecraft that seemed to be towing the planet. After scanning the ships and seeing no brain activity from within, the group was sent out to destroy the ships, with the assumption that it would cease the progress of the planet. As the group began cutting into the ships they began to notice that they were piloted after all. Just as this realization was hit, so was the Sakaarian ship... rammed by one of the K'ai starships. Even with the destruction of those that seemed to be towing the planet, K'ai was still moving. Banner sent the</p><p>crew to the planet to find the source of the power that was causing it to move and smash it. Skaar insisted on going with Banner to confront (destroy) Hiro-Kala, but Banner transported Korg, Skaar and A-Bomb to a different part of the planet while he transported directly to Hiro-Kala's position. Bruce was immediately attacked by the mindless, controlled population of K'ai and had no resort but to defend himself, apologizing the entire time. After the initial wave was taken out, possessed children began to attack him. Blinding them with an explosive, Banner retreated, only to be attacked by Hiro-Kala himself. Hiro-Kala slaughtered the children with an energy blast, and the blast depleted Banner's Banner-tech shields as well. After asking Banner who he was, Banner replied that he was his father, and promptly powered up into the Hulk, calling Hiro-Kala a 'little monster'.</p><p>Hulk asked Hiro-Kala if he knew that in attacking the Hulk, he would kill the mind-controlled children, and Hiro-Kala responded, \"Of course\", and proceeded to kill several more with a blast of power. This enraged the Hulk and he attacked his son. The two fought back and forth while Hulk argued with Skaar (via an earpiece). Skaar didn't believe that Hulk would be able to kill Hiro-Kala and that since he was the 'Killer of Killers', he should come take care of the job. During this time, Skaar, Korg, and A-Bomb were supposed to be redirecting the blast of K'ai's volcanoes to redirect their course away from Earth. Skaar absorbed the force of the explosion to avoid killing innocent people and apparently sacrificed himself. During this time, Hulk had gotten the upper-hand on Hiro-Kala and had come to realize that he couldn't kill his own son. He then reverted to Banner, and Banner zapped him with an</p><p>Old Power taser. In doing this, he caused Hiro-Kala to lose control of his Old Power and at the same time, Skaar reappeared behind them, sword in hand. Immediately before the fight, Banner grabbed the only two surviving K'iatian children and teleported to the location of the She-Hulks, who were trying to stop the mindless masses from dying. The Woldmind could only revert the mindless people that it could physically touch, due to the damage done by Hiro-Kala. Banner rigged up a modification to his Bannertech teleportation system and powered the Worldmind's signal to revert everyone else across the planet. At this time, Betty, in her human form, seemed to be falling for Bruce again, dropping some of the doubt she seemed to have while they were in Florida.</p><p>The two fought briefly and Skaar easily overpowered Hiro-Kala. Skaar grabbed him and began to try to talk him down, showing him some of his memories, via the Old Power, of Caiera and how he came to be banished to Earth. He told Hiro-Kala that Banner had helped calm the monster within him and that Bruce could do the same for him. At that moment, Banner returned, and Hiro-Kala began to show them some of his own memories, hoping that these would show the two why he had to destroy the Old Power. He searched for the memory wherein Caiera told him to destroy the Old Power, but he could not manifest it. The K'ai Worldmind informed him that it was not a real memory and the Old Power could not manifest dreams. At this, Hiro-Kala erupted in anger, blasting Banner away from him. At this moment, Skaar grabbed Hiro-Kala and fused him into the stone surface of K'ai, immobilizing him. Believing that he was now calm enough to transport to Earth, Banner told Skaar to free him, but as Skaar tried to use the Old Power to release him, he could not. The K'ai Worldmind would not allow it. The Worldmind lifted the stone mound from the ground and used Hiro-Kala's power to heal the planet. Hiro-Kala's last words to his father were: \"You tried, father. But the Worldmind is right. Your can't ever make this right. You were too late.\"</p><p>The Hulks left the planet, but not before Axeman Bone asked Skaar to remain there and be their hero. Skaar declined, telling him that they were fresh out of heroes. Aboard the ship, Banner had again become the Hulk, and as Betty Ross tried to comfort and congratulate him, Hulk yelled at her in his anger over losing his son. At this, Betty transformed back into her Red She-Hulk persona while Korg tried to tell the group that they needed to prove to Hulk that they would always be there for him, regardless of what blame he tried to put on himself. Red She-Hulk scoffed at the idea, telling them that they needed to realize that some people are meant to be alone</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/incredible-hulks-dark-son-incredible-hulks-dark-son/4000-263351/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-263351\">Incredible Hulks: Dark Son</a></li><li><a href=\"/incredible-hulks-enigma-force-dark-son-incredible-hulks-enigma-force-dark-son/4000-267295/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-267295\">Incredible Hulks: Enigma Force: Dark Son</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/los-increibles-hulks-1/4000-539118/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-539118\">Los Increíbles Hulks #1</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/los-increibles-hulks-2/4000-539119/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-539119\">Los Increíbles Hulks #2</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/los-increibles-hulks-3/4000-539120/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-539120\">Los Increíbles Hulks #3</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"/the-incredible-hulks-/4000-334151/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-334151\">The Incredible Hulks #1</a> (UK)</li><li><a href=\"/the-incredible-hulks-/4000-334152/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-334152\">The Incredible Hulks #2</a> (UK)</li><li><a href=\"/the-incredible-hulks-/4000-339664/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-339664\">The Incredible Hulks #3</a> (UK)</li></ul>",

Elixir walks and and ask her if she's okay. Domino says she's great when Elixir notices the bullet holes in her back and asks her what happened. The memory flashes in Domino's mind of her getting severely beating up in her apartment. Domino tells Elixir nothing and asks him to heal her. Right when Elixir raises his hand to heal her, Wolverine grabs it and tells him to hold on and that he has a few questions before he begins. Domino is reluctant to tell Wolverine. She ultimately is forced to tell him everything otherwise Wolverine won't allow Elixir to heal her. Domino tells Wolverine it was the Assassins Guild. As Domino begins to tell the story, X-23 is shown listening from the other side of the door, everyone unaware of her presence. Domino tells Wolverine she took the job because she needed the money. She tells him how The Hand set up shop in New Orleans and were running weapons in and out through the Gulf. The Assassins Guild new what moves The Hand were going to make, they just needed a little \"luck\" on their side. During the mission, Domino found a room full on female teenagers. Domino claims the Assassins Guild knew what The Hand was up to but didn't tell her about the young girls. Domino chose to rescue the girls and leave the Assassins Guild and the The Hand to tear each other apart which upset the Guild. At that moment fired two bullets from a gun toward the door, knocking it off its hinges and exposing X-23 whose immediate response was that if the Guild caught Domino, they wouldn't just let her escape. Wolverine tells her to stay out of it and tells Elixir to heal Domino.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1266521-1276107232.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1266521\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3733333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1266521-1276107232.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1266521\"><img alt=\"X-Force: Sex &amp; Violence #1\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1266521-1276107232.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1266521-1276107232.jpg 900w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1266521-1276107232.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1266521-1276107232.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>X-Force: Sex &amp; Violence #1</figcaption></figure><p>Wolverine and Domino are driving in a Mustang when Domino tells Wolverine she knows that she knows he's wanted her ever since Japan. Right when Wolverine was about to respond he was shot through the window which caused him to run into a street pole and flip the car. Members of the Assassins Guild appeared telling Domino they gave her 24 hours to return to them alone and they only extend that offer one time. Domino pretends to surrender but begins to open fire on them. Wolverine enters the fight, clawing a few of the members severely. Wolverine and Domino were standing back to back when Domino calls Logan's name. The two turn around and begin to kiss when someone yells out \"Neena!\" Razorfist shows up and asks Domino where the money is. Wolverine looks at her and asks the same thing. Domino replies with \"whoops.\"</p><h3>Chapter Two:</h3><p>Wolverine asks her again where the money is. Domino tells him to help her and she'll tell him later. The two engage the Guild and Razorfist. Wolverine decapitates a few members until Razorfist plunges his razor into Wolverine from behind him. Wolverine uses his adamantium claws to cut Razorfist's razor in half and then headbutts him. Razorfist tells Wolverine and Domino they're both dead. Wolverine tells him if he ever hears the words razor and fist used in the same sentence again, he'll track him down and kill him. Domino fills Wolverine in a little more about the operation and how it went down. She told him once she found the room full of young girls, she took them to the Japanese Consulate in Texas. She shows him the truck she got away in and how she didn't know that it was full of money in the back until she was out of the state. She tells him there's a total of 237 million dollars. She then suggests they go get a hotel room and work this out. The two head to a hotel and have sex. In the meantime, the Assassins Guild is assembling their specialists to take out Wolverine and Domino which include Boomerang, Nakh, Clay,</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335264\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.271875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335264\"><img alt=\"X-Force: Sex &amp; Violence #2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg 1280w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Force: Sex &amp; Violence #2\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg 1280w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1335264-x_force_sv_2_0016.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Force: Sex &amp; Violence #2</figcaption></figure><p>Bushwacker, Bullet and Black Mamba.

Domino dodges the bullets and returns fire hitting Bushwackers gun causing an explosion. Wolverine proceeds to cut his arm gun completely off. He puts his claws to his throat and demands to know how he found them. Bushwacker comes clean about Razorfist's tracer he planted on Wolverine and tell shim that the Assassins Guild is sending everyone in after them. Wolverine tells Domino they have to move the money before they lose it and their only leverage. Bella Donna is informed they've lost contact with Bushwacker. She tells her informant to they'll be coming to their current location and that they need to put an operative at the airport. Clay is sent to the airport to kill Wolverine and capture Domino.

Outside members of The Hand are staking the place out as well. The Hand hear a noise and turn around unaware that Vanisher had just teleported right behind them moments ago. Wolverine and Domino enter the building and become surrounded by Guild members. Bella Donna greets them and claims to have given Domino a chance but she chose to abuse her generosity. Wolverine tells her that she better leave them alone and he'll let them all live. Bella Donna asked about the money which Wolverine said will go to charity. Domino wasn't thrilled about this at all and neither was Bella Donna who sent her Guild after them. The fight breaks out and it isn't long until the Guild begins to get the upper hand. Bushwacker slashes the side of Wolverine's face off. Domino gets severely injured not allowing her to walk. Wolverine tries to carry her out but is ambushed from behind by The Hand who put a knife to his throat. Bella Donna tells The Hand to drop their weapons and them comply.

Vanisher teleports the X-Force out of there and back to Angel's Aerie. Wolverine starts yelling at X-23 for entering the fight. Warpath tells him to lay off her.

    "deck": "The Arrancar Saga narrates the struggle between Ichigo and the Gotei 13 against the forces of the Arrancar race, lead and created by Aizen Sousuke",
    "description": "<h2>Plot</h2><p>The entire Saga it's subdivides in five more sub-arcs, spacing in four years from 2006 to 2010.</p><h3>The Arrancar Invasions</h3><p>(volume 21-27) in the aftermatch of the Soul Society Arc, Ichigo and his friends go back to Earth, trying to live their lifes again. In the meantime, Aizen Sousuke got into Hueco Mundo, where he have already assembled an army to declare war to the Soul Society. As it is later revealed, his target it's the destruction of Karakura Town, to create the \"King Key\", that will allow him to attack the Spirit King of the Soul Society in his dimension. The \"Invasions\" are four different attacks from the Arrancar on Karakura and all the shinigami's forces in the city.</p><p><em>The First Invasion</em>: it's a solitary raid from the imperfect arrancar Grand Fisher, who gets killed off by Ichigo father.</p><p><em>The Second Invasion</em>: Ulquiorra and Yammy come to earth to \"test\" Ichigo powers, finding him \"worthless trash\".</p><p><em>The Third Invasion</em>: unauthorized, Grimmjow take his gang and attack Karakura with the purpose of killing all possible enemies.</p><p>In one night of fights, five arrancars die, while Grimmjow is taken back in Hueco Mundo and scold for his failure from Aizen and Tousen. Finding himself too weak to the battles to come, Ichigo goes to the Vizards to be trained by them. While he's doing so, the <em>Fourth Invasion</em> starts: Grimmjow, Yammy, Luppi and Wonderwyce engages the shinigami contingent, while Ulquiorra kidnaps Orihime, bringing her to Hueco Mundo.</p><h3>The Invasion of Hueco Mundo</h3><p>(28-35) or simply \"Hueco Mundo Arc\". Ichigo, Ishida, Chad, Renji &amp; Rukia attack Hueco Mundo and the Arrancar's fortress, Las Noches, with the intent of saving Orihime. In their struggle against the Espada they're later assisted by a task force of Soul Society's Captains. Main conflicts during the invasion:</p><p><em>The Privaron Espada's Fights</em></p><p><em>The Battle against Aaroniero Arruruerie</em>: Rukia defeats the 9th Espada after he tried to trick her disguising himself as a long lost friend of the shinigami.</p><p><em>Ichigo vs Grimmjow</em></p><p><em>The Battle against Zommari LeRoux</em>: the 7th Espada against Byakuya Kuchiki.</p><p><em>The Battle against Szayel Aporro Grantz</em>: one of the longest and most elaborated fights of this Arc, that involved seven different characters.</p><p><em>The Battle against Nnoitra Jiruga</em>: Zaraki, Ichigo and Nelliel vs the 5th Espada. At the end of the confrontation with Jiruga, Aizen set his plan in motion, trapping the Shinigami in the Hueco Mundo, while his main forces attack Earth.</p><p><em>The Battle against Ulquiorra Schiffer</em>: Ichigo vs the 4th Espada. Takes place during the Winter War.</p><p><em>The Battle against Yammy Ryalgo</em>: Zaraki, Byakuya &amp; Mayuri vs the Espada Zero. Takes place during the Winter War and the Deicide Arc.</p><h3>Turn Back The Pendulum</h3><p>(36) or \"The Pendulum Arc\" the shortest arc, that doesn't even features the Arrancars. In a pause from the actual story, we explore the Soul Society of 100 years in the past, discovering that the Vizards are all ex-members of the Gotei 13, victims of Aizen, who's beginning to create his plan.</p><h3>The Winter War</h3><p>(37-45) also known as \"Fake-Karakura Town Arc\", the forces of Gotei 13 gather around a spiritual version of Karakura Town, engaging Aizen, Gin, Tousen and the Top Three Espada with their foot soldiers. The Battle Consist of four phases:</p><p><em>The Battle at the Four Pillars</em></p><p><em>The Fracciones Battles</em></p><p><em>The Espada Fights</em></p><p><em>Gotei &amp; Wizards vs Aizen</em></p><h3>The Deicide Arc</h3><p>(46-48) the second shortest tale of the Saga, and also the second one that pretty much doesn't feature any Arrancar at all (except in the ending). After single handedly defeat the entire Gotei 13, Aizen clash against Ichigo Kurosaki, and later against the newcomers Urahara, Yoruichi and Isshin (while Ichigo confronts Gin). All this fights, activates the Hogyoku that Aizen have placed in his chest, beginning the process that will allow him to become a God.</p><p>During this transformations, Aizen defeats his enemies and along with Gin goes to the Soul Society to finally create the King Key. Here, Gin betrays his master, trying to kill him. The only thing he manage to do it's forcing even more the mutation process, making Aizen stronger.</p><p>But the final battle of the Saga finally begin: Ichigo, with the help of his father, have sustained a \"spiritual training\" inside his own mind, completly dominating his zanpakuto. When he clashes with Aizen, his able to overpower him with the god-like \"Mungetsu\". But even this is not enough. Aizen resurface from the battlefield while Ichigo loses all his powers in echange for the weapon previously used.</p><p>It's Urahara who come and save the day: during his previous fight he have placed a hidden seal in his attacks that would activet himself in the moment of major weakness of the New God. Aizen it's finally defeated, sentenced to 38.800 years of prison (because he's now immortal) in the deepest hole of the Soul Society, while the natural order it's restored. Unfortunately Ichigo have lost all his powers, making him impossible to even communicate with all the others shinigami or spirits.</p><p>The Arrancar Saga ends with him giving his farewell to Rukia and the Soul Society.</p><h3>Hell Arc Prologue</h3><p>The prologue to the \"Hell Arc\" movie is linked to the events of the saga: it show us the destiny of Apollo Grantz e Aaroniero, two of the major villains during the Hueco Mundo Invasion. Both of them end up in hell after their defeat.</p><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-131316\" href=\"/bleach-be-my-family-or-not/4000-131316/\" slug=\"bleach-be-my-family-or-not\">Bleach #21</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-131317\" href=\"/bleach-conquistadores/4000-131317/\" slug=\"bleach-conquistadores\">Bleach #22</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-134786\" href=\"/bleach-mala-suerte/4000-134786/\" slug=\"bleach-mala-suerte\">Bleach #23</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-134786\" href=\"/bleach-mala-suerte/4000-134786/\" slug=\"bleach-mala-suerte\">Bleach #24</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135101\" href=\"/bleach-no-shaking-throne/4000-135101/\" slug=\"bleach-no-shaking-throne\">Bleach #25</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135102\" href=\"/bleach-the-mascaron-drive/4000-135102/\" slug=\"bleach-the-mascaron-drive\">Bleach #26</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135103\" href=\"/bleach-good-bye-halcyon-days/4000-135103/\" slug=\"bleach-good-bye-halcyon-days\">Bleach #27</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135104\" href=\"/bleach-barons-lecture-full-course/4000-135104/\" slug=\"bleach-barons-lecture-full-course\">Bleach #28</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135105\" href=\"/bleach-the-slashing-opera/4000-135105/\" slug=\"bleach-the-slashing-opera\">Bleach #29</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135106\" href=\"/bleach-there-is-no-heart-without-you/4000-135106/\" slug=\"bleach-there-is-no-heart-without-you\">Bleach #30</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135107\" href=\"/bleach-dont-kill-my-volupture/4000-135107/\" slug=\"bleach-dont-kill-my-volupture\">Bleach #31</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135108\" href=\"/bleach-howling/4000-135108/\" slug=\"bleach-howling\">Bleach #32</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135109\" href=\"/bleach-the-bad-joke/4000-135109/\" slug=\"bleach-the-bad-joke\">Bleach #33</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-135110\" href=\"/bleach-king-of-the-kill/4000-135110/\" slug=\"bleach-king-of-the-kill\">Bleach #34</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-166472\" href=\"/bleach-higher-than-the-moon/4000-166472/\" slug=\"bleach-higher-than-the-moon\">Bleach #35</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-166891\" href=\"/bleach-turn-back-the-pendulum/4000-166891/\" slug=\"bleach-turn-back-the-pendulum\">Bleach #36</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-169789\" href=\"/bleach-beauty-is-so-solitary/4000-169789/\" slug=\"bleach-beauty-is-so-solitary\">Bleach #37</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-169790\" href=\"/bleach-fear-for-fight/4000-169790/\" slug=\"bleach-fear-for-fight\">Bleach #38</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-169791\" href=\"/bleach-el-verdugo/4000-169791/\" slug=\"bleach-el-verdugo\">Bleach #39</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-169792\" href=\"/bleach-the-lust/4000-169792/\" slug=\"bleach-the-lust\">Bleach #40</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-178553\" href=\"/bleach-heart/4000-178553/\" slug=\"bleach-heart\">Bleach #41</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-187099\" href=\"/bleach-shock-of-the-queen/4000-187099/\" slug=\"bleach-shock-of-the-queen\">Bleach #42</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-195267\" href=\"/bleach-kingdom-of-hollows/4000-195267/\" slug=\"bleach-kingdom-of-hollows\">Bleach #43</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-208823\" href=\"/bleach-vice-it/4000-208823/\" slug=\"bleach-vice-it\">Bleach #44</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-225228\" href=\"/bleach-the-burnout-inferno/4000-225228/\" slug=\"bleach-the-burnout-inferno\">Bleach #45</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-231990\" href=\"/bleach-back-from-blind/4000-231990/\" slug=\"bleach-back-from-blind\">Bleach #46</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-236442\" href=\"/bleach-end-of-the-chrysalis-age/4000-236442/\" slug=\"bleach-end-of-the-chrysalis-age\">Bleach #47</a> (Japan)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4000-246679\" href=\"/bleach-god-is-dead/4000-246679/\" slug=\"bleach-god-is-dead\">Bleach #48</a> (Japan)</li></ul>",

    "deck": "The Chaos King embodied the universe before anything existed. He is the nothingness from which everything sprang and the state to which it will someday return. While this may be an inevitable cycle, the Chaos King wished to destroy the multiverse before its time, hoping to ensure that it would never be able to recreate itself again.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>It would seem the return of the formerly believed-to-be-dead <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a> would herald joy for the world, but instead he brings grave warning to the heroes of the world. Brought back by the Prince of Power; <a href=\"/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\">Amadeus Cho</a>, Hercules, with <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> and Cho by his side, lead an army of heroes to face the looming multiversal threat of the <a href=\"/mikaboshi/4005-44368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44368\">Chaos King</a> who had and was attacking, killing and consuming the power of all the gods and god-like beings from all pantheons and dimensions across the multiverse in an effort to consume and absorb the entirety of the multiverse to return it to it's original state; pure chaos. When Hercules lead the heroes for their initial attack on him, the Chaos King incapacitated the heroes and all the citizens of the world by using <a href=\"/nightmare/4005-2646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2646\">Nightmare's</a> dreampower, leaving no one but gods and other god-like beings to oppose him. Hercules and Thor, with the help of Amadeus Cho, brought together a new incarnation of Herc's former team, the <a href=\"/the-god-squad/4060-55685/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55685\">God Squad</a> to defend reality and devise a way to stop the Chaos King.</p><p>The Chaos King solidified his hold on the universe with more gods of the different pantheons as they fall to his power. Soon after gaining control of all the various realms/aspects fo the underworld, he released the lost souls of countless dead people including the dead members of <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a>, <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, and the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-men</a>. With the influence of death removed from the universe, dead heroes and villains alike return to the land of the living, with many choosing to fight either for or against the Chaos King. In the end, it all comes back to the Chaos King as he now fights the only one left to stand in his way; the new, All-Father Hercules. The two adversaries battle savagely on a scale that dwarfs planets. With space and time crumbling as there fight rages, Amadeus instructs Hercules to punch the Chaos King into a pocket universe (the Continuum) where he is now alone as the be-all, end-all which made him believe he had won. The multiverse, however, had been laid waste by the Chaos King's war upon it and was now in shambles. Realizing this, Hercules, in what would be his last act as the all-powerful God of Gods, used his omnipotence to repair and restore the multiverse to it's proper state. Unfortunately, the act of doing this was so incredibley difficult it required every bit of godly power and might he possessed, leaving him fully and completely mortal afterward.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p>The Greek demigod <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a> had been presumed dead, but the moment Amadeus Cho brought him back and made him an all-father (the greatest of a pantheon of gods), he knew immediately that Amatsu-Mikaboshi (The Chaos King) was about to launch his attempt to destroy all of creation.</p><p>Emboldened by the destruction of <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a> at the end of the <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a>, the Chaos King hoped to destroy all of the gods and then the defenseless multiverse. He started by finding and murdering <a href=\"/nightmare/4005-2646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2646\">Nightmare</a>, the Lord of Dreams, this gave him the power to destroy any mortal mind he touched, which he used against the heroes that Hercules assembled to attack him, plunging them into waking comas.</p><p>Amatsu-Mikaboshi then attacked the afterlife. To defend himself, <a href=\"/hades/4005-70048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70048\">Hades</a> (Pluto) released the dead to fight for him, resurrecting dead gods and heroes including <a href=\"/ares/4005-11940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11940\">Ares</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/genis-vell/4005-4813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4813\">Genis-Vell</a>, <a href=\"/deathcry/4005-7231/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7231\">Deathcry, </a> <a href=\"/doctor-druid/4005-10302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10302\">Doctor Druid, </a> <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\">Zeus</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/banshee/4005-9708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9708\">Banshee</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/moira-mactaggert/4005-8304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8304\">Moira MacTaggert, </a> <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/swordsman/4005-3795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3795\">Swordsman</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thunderbird/4005-2174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2174\">Thunderbird</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a>, and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/yellowjacket-demara/4005-1501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1501\">Yellowjacket</a>. Despite this, the Chaos King triumphed.</p><p>In response, Hercules assembled a new <a href=\"/the-god-squad/4060-55685/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55685\">The God Squad</a> consisting of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\">Amadeus Cho, </a> <a href=\"/hellstorm/4005-14695/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14695\">Hellstorm, </a> <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus, </a> <a href=\"/sersi/4005-2118/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2118\">Sersi</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer, </a> <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor, </a> <a href=\"/venus/4005-12632/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12632\">Venus</a>, and himself. With the help of the wisdom of the traitorous Athena, the Chaos King outwitted and defeated them all. After conferring with Gaea, Amadeus Cho realized that there was no way for them to defeat the Chaos King. Desperate, Hercules allowed <a href=\"/pele/4005-42913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42913\">Pele</a>, the goddess of fire, to turn him to ashes so he could remake himself as a god able to tap into the fullness of his newfound power. As Hercules went to face off the Chaos King, Amadeus Cho convinced Galactus to open a portal to an empty multiverse the goddess Hera had created to replace the real one. The Chaos King was beating Hercules and all of his friends, but Amadeus Cho couldn't decide who of the millions of people on Earth he should save in the limited time that remained. In a flash of inspiration, he had Herules knock the Chaos King into the empty continuum, which he immediately destroyed, thinking it to be the real multiverse. With the Chaos King defeated, Hercules spent every last bit of all-father powers to restore the multiverse as it had been before the Chaos War begun. When he was done, several of the dead who'd been released by Pluto remained restored to life, including <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/yellowjacket-demara/4005-1501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1501\">Yellowjacket</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/swordsman/4005-3795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3795\">Swordsman</a> and several members of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight.</a></p><p>Soon after this event, Bruce Banner confronted Hercules and demanded that he fix the Hulks' problems as a reward for what they had done during the Chaos War. When Hercules revealed that he no longer possessed the All-Father's powers, Banner turned into the Hulk, stormed Olympus and challenged Zeus to a battle. The Hulk was defeated and chained to the mountain, where vultures devoured his body for days. Hercules and the rest of the Hulk family saved him. Zeus decided that Hulk had learned to respect him and he wouldn't pursue him any longer - such an auto-destructive persona as him will bring the best punishment upon himself.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/chaos-war-tpb/4000-269288/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-269288\">Chaos War</a></li><li><a href=\"/chaos-war-avengers-chaos-war-avengers/4000-270245/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-270245\">Chaos War: Avengers</a></li><li><a href=\"/chaos-war-incredible-hulks-chaos-war-incredible-hulks/4000-278461/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-278461\">Chaos War: Incredible Hulks</a></li><li><a href=\"/chaos-war-x-men-tpb/4000-271841/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-271841\">Chaos War: X-Men</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/los-increibles-hulks-4/4000-539121/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-539121\">Los Increíbles Hulks #4</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/los-increibles-hulks-5/4000-539122/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-539122\">Los Increíbles Hulks #5</a> (Spain)</li><li>Marvel Crossover #71</li><li>Marvel Crossover #72</li><li>Marvel Crossover #73</li><li><a href=\"/the-incredible-hulks-4/4000-387547/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-387547\">The Incredible Hulks #4</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-incredible-hulks-5/4000-348186/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-348186\">The Incredible Hulks #5</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-mighty-world-of-marvel-/4000-335386/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-335386\">The Mighty World of Marvel #35</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-mighty-world-of-marvel-death-of-the-gods/4000-340549/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-340549\">The Mighty World of Marvel #36</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-mighty-world-of-marvel-nothing-stops-the-juggernaut/4000-344744/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-344744\">The Mighty World of Marvel #37</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-mighty-world-of-marvel-/4000-355925/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-355925\">The Mighty World of Marvel #38</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<blockquote>\"In Elseworlds, heroes are taken from their usual settings and put into strange times and places - some that have existed, or might have existed, and others that can't, couldn't or shouldn't exist.\"</blockquote><p>As part of DC's yearly annual events 1994 was the year of the Elseworlds, twenty-three of the ongoing titles at the time were given the Elseworlds treatment and were re-imagined in many ways. The 1994 annuals showcased some of the best and worst takes on many of DC's characters and featured some of the biggest talents in the industry at the time. All but two of the Elseworld annuals were stand alone issues; Adventures of Superman Annual #6 and Superboy Annual #1 were part of a two part storyline entitled \"The Super Seven\".</p><p>For further Elseworlds information visit the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-46699\" href=\"/elseworlds/4015-46699/\" slug=\"elseworlds\">Elseworlds</a> <i>(concept)</i> page.</p>",

But in that scattering, on a thousand different worlds, by a thousand different ways... Earth's greatest legends live on. These are... Legends of the Dead Earth.\" <br/> <br/>DC's  1996 annual event was branded as Legends of the Dead Earth. These are  not officially labeled as Elseworld tales but many consider them to be  Elseworlds because they take place in the distant future and feature  stories influenced by the legends/stories/legacies of the heroes and  villains of the past for that particular title. A few of these annuals  are actually in continuity because the characters are from the distant  future. Twenty-five annuals had the Legends of the Dead Earth branding. </p>",

Matt changed into Daredevil and rushed her to the hospital, but unfortunately she did not make it. At the hospital it is revealed that the girl had overdosed on Angel Dust. The girl's brother, Billy, is very upset about it. He reveals that the man responsible is called <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/hogman/4005-65673/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65673\">the Hogman</a> and says he is going to do something about it.</p><p>Later after tracking down Hogman's partner Joey, Daredevil encounter the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a>, who recently broke out of Rykers prison. Punisher tries to kill Joey, but before he can someone else shoots the man. Daredevil runs up to a rooftop and finds Billy holding a gun. Billy says he aimed up, that he didn't try to shoot him and Daredevil believes him. He successfully defends Billy in court as Matt Murdock, pinning the crime on Hogman himself. Afterwards Billy is acquitted of the charges Hogman screams he didn't do it, and by listening to his heartbeat Matt could tell he was not lying.</p><p>Matt defends Hogman next because he thinks he is innocent. After he gets Hogman off on all charges, Hogman reveals to him that he did kill Joey. Turns out that he has a paste maker and that is why Matt couldn't tell he was lying. Daredevil chases after him later, wanting to bring him to justice. He encounters the Punisher again and they manage to take out the Hogman and his allies. Afterwards Daredevil shoots the Punisher with one of the criminals guns so he can be sent back to prison. With newfound evidence the Hogman is imprisoned and justice is served.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/daredevil-by-frank-miller-and-klaus-janson-volume-two/4000-184104/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-184104\">Daredevil by Frank Miller and Klaus Janson Vol. 2</a></li><li><a href=\"/daredevil-visionaries-frank-miller-/4000-85510/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-85510\">Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller Vol. 3</a></li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/daredevil-and-the-punisher-childs-play/4050-33165/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33165\">Daredevil And The Punisher: Child's Play</a></li></ul>",
