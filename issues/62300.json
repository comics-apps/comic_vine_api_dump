That’s pronounced ah-rahn-ya, for all you gringos! <br/>Straight from AMAZING FANTASY-- the continuing adventures of Anya Corazon, scrappy teen from Brooklyn by day, and by night, the butt-kicking Hunter of the ancient and mystical Spider Society! <br/>As seen in the NY Daily News, Fox News, CNN, and Telemundo, Marvel’s first Latina super hero is getting a brand-new monthly book and sporting a new dimension to her costume. </p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Overview:</i></p><p>Five words to strike fear into the hearts of spies and evildoers everywhere: Jamie Madrox, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Except Madrox has decided that it’s time to start gathering in the stray dupes that are still wandering around, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent doesn’t especially want to go...and S.H.I.E.L.D. isn’t especially inclined to let him go.</p><p><u><b>Issue Summary:</b></u></p><p>“Yeaaaaah,” Jamie thinks, as he considers to the held-held automatic rifles pointed at him. This day isn’t going the way he’d hoped.</p><p>Trying to remain calm, Jamie silently tells himself to think of something incredibly clever to say. When “Hey, there,” is what comes, Jamie chides himself. Perfect. <i>There’s</i> dazzling witty repartee for you. Then again, even though he’s trying to get his act together, this hasn’t exactly been his day for knowing just what to say or what to do, has it? Considering it started off with his failing spectacularly in fence-mending with Theresa and Monet, the best thing one can say about him today… is that he’s been consistent.</p><p>(flashback)</p><p>As repairmen from “Danny’s Home Repairs” attend to the broken window through which he was thrown earlier, Jamie pleads to Terry to say something. <i>Do</i> something. Don’t just… Kneeling next to her as she sits on the couch, looking at a magazine, Jamie asks if hitting him would make her feel better. Then do it, he instructs her. Slug him. Or yell at him. Or cry at him. Or grab his hair and tear it out at the roots. Something <i>Anything</i>. Just not the glare and the silent treatment.</p><p>Look, he pleads through his distraught countenance, pot-marked with three band-aids, he’s… He’s ninety-percent sure that <i>he’s</i> the one she slept with her, and not his… y;know… unleashed libido. And he <i>should</i> have told her earlier, but she…</p><p>Interrupting, Theresa speaks Jamie’s name in a whisper. Smiling that he has finally received a reply, Jamie replies that he’s listening. She doesn’t have to whisper. Yes, she does, she rejoins. See… if she <i>whispers</i>, it’s easier for her to control herself. If she starts talking… she’s going to start <i>shouting</i>, then comes <i>yelling</i>, then comes <i>screaming</i>. And then comes a demolished neighborhood. So she needs him to <i>walk away</i> before that happens.</p><p>Understanding, Jamie rises to his feet and, his arms wide in acceptance, suggests that they do this later when she’s not as, y’know… Homicidal, she offers, not even looking in his direction. Right, he answers. That. Not taking his eyes off of Theresa, Jamie instead backs away. Okay, later then… Suddenly feeling himself pulled backwards, Jamie emits an understandably worried, “Uh-oh.”</p><p>Half a moment later, Jamie finds himself lifted off his feet by Monet, who presses him against the wall with enough force to generate a dupe. Incensed, she announces that she wants to <i>talk</i> to him. When Jamie doesn’t seem to understand, Monet clarifies. The dupe who seduced her. She realizes now there’s no point kicking <i>his</i> tail. She wants the dupe’s. Turning her attention to the newly-created dupe, she asks him if he is him. When the dupe begins to sob, tears streaming from his eyes, she says nope. Definitely not.</p><p>Still off of his feet and against the wall, Jamie suggests that she put him down and they can… He is interrupted, as Monet pulls him away from the wall far enough to push him back, generating another dupe by the impact. Pressing his finger against his jugular, the new dupe announces that his pulse is going like a jackrabbit and wonders what is diastolic is… Ignoring him, Monet tells Madrox Prime to c’mon. Is he hiding him?</p><p>Calling her “super ex-girlfriend,” Jamie has had enough. He tells her it doesn’t <i>work</i> that way. He doesn’t have any <i>control</i> over it. He can’t just… just <i>will</i> one particular dupe into existence! It’s the luck of the draw! Coldly, Monet repeats his words, “luck of the draw.” Fine, she tells him. She’ll just keep dealing it out. Bumping him up against the wall again, Monet shouts to the new dupe, asking, “Are <i>you</i> him?” Sheepishly, the dupe replies that violence is not the way to enlightenment. Instead, they must…</p><p>Ignoring the new dupe, Monet returns her attention to Madrox Prime and begins repeatedly and violently to bump him against the wall.</p><p>Standing outside a door, Guido announces that he’s changed his mind. He can’t do this. To this, Rahne replies that she doesn’t want to be there. He forced her so she could force him. Just get on with it, okay? But be tactful. After a quick rap of his knuckles on the door, Guido tells her to screw this. He should just turn himself over to the cops, get it over with. If that’s what he wants, Rahne replies. She won’t stand in his w…</p><p>Her words trail as the door is opened by Alix Buchanan, who recognizes Guido. “Mister, uh… Carosella, is it? Of X-Factor.” When he confirms, Ali then notes “Miss Sinclair,” saying that he wasn’t expecting to see them. Has there been a break in the case? Do they know where…”</p><p>Interrupting sheepishly, Guido tells Mizz Buchanan that, here’s the thing… Rahne begins to say that they’d like to come in and explain, but Guido cannot hold it in any longer. Gushing, he explains that her husband’s dead. The reason he knows is that he killed him. Crushed his throat. Before Guido can elaborate any further, Alix Buchanan faints, landing with a thud onto her floor. Lifting his miniscule goggles, Guido asks Mizz Buchanan if she is okay, while Rahne rolls her eyes. Yeah, bloody tactful that, she mocks.</p><p>At the former mutant bar called the Power Plant, Jamie and Rictor are the only two patrons. The rest of the bar is deserted, save for the bartender and their waitress, who brings them a fresh pair of bottles. Remarking to Madrox’s bandages, Rictor asks what happened to him. He looks like something the cat dragged in and then barfed on. It’s… complicated, he replies. And <i>private</i>. He doesn’t need to know. To this, Rictor asks if this is a bout him and a dupe doin’ the horizontal mambo with both Monet and Terry.</p><p>Reeling from this, Jamie haltingly asks how’d he… Interrupting, Rictor replies, “I’m Rictor. I know stuff.” Hearing this, Jamie remarks that Layla blabbed. To this, Rictor remarks that she annoys the snot outta him, but he’s gotta admit, the kid’s got her uses. So, Rictor then adds, pointing his fresh beer bottle at Jamie as the waitress provides him his. Fess up. <i>Which</i> filly is the <i>wilder</i> ride? Dismissively, Jamie tells Rictor that he’s a real pig, does he know that? A <i>real pig</i>. So announced, the table is devoid of conversation, as Jamie takes a swig of his beer, while Rictor examines his fingernails with a whistle. The table the turns to complete silence as Rictor brings his own bottle to his mouth, as he casually takes a swallow. A moment later, looking away, Jamie finally answers with “Monet,” to which Rictor excitedly yells, “I <i>knew</i> it. I freakin’ <i>knew</i> it.”</p><p>Turning back to Rictor, Jamie explains that Theresa’s like… like ocean waves washing over you. Monet’s like a monsoon. Remarking back, Rictor says that it sounds like, either way, anyone in the first five rows is gonna get soaked. Pretty much, Jamie replies. And now they both hate his guts, he adds, moving his fingers against his chin in thought.</p><p>Still smiling, Rictor replies that they’ll get over it. And hey, man… what a night he had, right? He always says, if you’re gonna go, go down in flames. When Jamie replies that he supposes, Rictor then says, <i>speaking</i> of going down… Interrupting before he can go further, Jamie tells him to shut up, or he swears to God…</p><p>Holding up his hands defensively, Rictor agrees. Change the subject. Fine, Jamie replies. So… he notices <i>Quicksilver’s</i> taken an interest in him lately. What up with <i>that</i>? Looking away, his demeanor changing slightly, Rictor replies that nothing’s “up.” Dude’s got a lot of interesting stuff to say, that’s all. Keeps talking ‘bout giving him his powers back. Not sure if he’s on the level. So, he’s been, y’know… feeling him out. No big deal. It ain’t like he’s <i>sleeping</i> with him… As Jamie then takes a swallow from his drink, sporting a playful grin, Rictor then adds “…anymore.” To Rictor’s surprise, in reaction to his own, Jamie spews forth a stream of beer from his mouth, covering Rictor’s face.</p><p>Wiping his face with his hand, Rictor calls over to the waitress, asking if he could get a towel. Still choking from the beer, Jamie haltingly asks Rictor if he and <i>Quicksilver</i>… Incredulous, Rictor replies to Jamie that, ever since he went all <i>noir</i>, he’s got, like, <i>zero</i> sense o’ humor. As Rictor then wipes his face with the towel, brought by their waitress, he realizes that it was just a joke. Of course, Rictor replies. Not that the guy/guy thing is… It’s just that Pietro’s semi-evil, and… “Gimme a little <i>credit</i>, huh?”</p><p>A little embarrassed, Jamie replies that at this point he’s ruling <i>nothing</i> out. He means, jeez… His dupes are out of control. Siryn and M are livid. Rahne only just started talking again. And she still won’t say what’s wrong. <i>Guido’s</i> a wreck. Even <i>Layla’s</i> looking jumpy. Some team. Lifting his bottle, Rictor toasts X-Factor: for putting the “fun” in “dysfunctional.” To this, he then adds that at least Pietro and he aren’t an item, so that’s good, right?” So toasted, Rictor takes a long drought. Not joining for the moment, Jamie replies that he supposes. With a slight smile, he adds that God knows Rictor wouldn’t want to make <i>Shatterstar</i> jealous. To this, Rictor involuntarily expels his mouthful of beer all over Jamie. Holding up the towel to the dumbstruck Rictor, Jamie remarks “First five rows, huh?”</p><p>Sitting on the couch, across the coffee table from Alix Buchanan, Rahne tells her that that’s the whole story. Guido wanted her to know. Standing some distance behind Rahne and her couch, Guido reclines against a stairway guardrail, his eyes downcast and arms folded across his stomach. Regarding Guido, the subject of Rahne’s tale, Alix asks if she’s saying he’s… he’s all right? Kinda depends on what sense, Rahne rejoins. They brought in a hypnotherapist who undid Singualrity’s damage. Among other things, Guido now remembers where SI’s operatives, uhm… Knowing full well why Rahne is hesitating, Guido finishes her sentence. “Dumped the body,” he says.</p><p>Agreeing, Rahne continues. The police were alerted via an “anonymous” tipster, so they’ve doubtless recovered it… him…, she corrects. So she will likely be hearing from, uh… The conversation having grown too difficult, Rhane’s words trail off, her eyes moving to avoid Alix.</p><p>Silent as she does so, Alix Buchanan reaches out, placing her coffee mug onto the table before her. Equally as mute, she stands, bypassing the wide-eyed Rahne as she makes her way toward the immobile Guido, still sheepishly reclined against the railing. Stopping a short distance from Guido and addressing him as “Mr. Carosella,” Alix asks him if he believes in God, much to his surprise. When she repeats this, more emphatically, he reluctantly admits that he’s kind of a lapsed Catholic. Why?</p><p>Henry and she were regular churchgoers, she replies. They believed that everything happens for a reason. <i>Every thing</i>, and every one… for a <i>reason</i>. She doesn’t know what his reason for being on this Earth is any more than she knows <i>hers</i>. But she knows what it’s <i>not</i>. It’s not to rot in jail because the monsters at Singularity <i>victimized</i> him. Henry wouldn’t have wanted that nor does she.</p><p>“But… his murder…” Guido stutters. Placing her had gently on his massive one, Alix replies that it will be just one more unsolved murder. Singularity gets no more victims. “They don’t get you,” she says. “Promise?” When he stammers in his response, she repeats it more emphatically. Though still stammering, Guido says that he guesses so… His word given, Alix Buchanan presses her diminutive form against the bulk of Guido Carosella in a heartfelt embrace. As he wraps his arms around her in reciprocation, tears come to them both.</p><p>Pondering the events at this meeting from elsewhere, Jamie Madrox is as sure as he knows anything that Guido is making a huge mistake, talking to Alix Buchanan. He can just image it, he thinks. The screaming. The recriminations. He killed her <i>husband</i>. She’s not gonna let him walk away from that. She’s probably calling the cops right now. He wishes he could help him, or her, or somebody. But how can he do that when he can’t even help out himself? So, he decided there’s only one guy for the job.</p><p>Walking among the other visitors at the Central Park Zoo, Jamie thinks how gorgeous a day it is. He likes looking at the animals. Some people get outraged at the caged beasts. They say it’s unnatural. Wrong. He says they’re lucky. No decisions. No choosing who lives and who dies. It’s bliss. Viewing the penguins, Jamie, still bandaged from his fight with Monet, says, “Remember: cute and cuddly, boys. Cute and cuddly.”</p><p>Approaching Jamie, Doc Samson asks if he is aware that he could have just come to his office. Replying that he does, Jamie then thanks the “Doc” for coming out there. Not a problem, Samson replies, adding, “Leonard Samson, shrink. Have couch, will travel.” It’s right on his business card.</p><p>Getting to business, Samson asks Jamie how things are with Monet and Theresa. When Jamie then asks what he thinks, Samson replies that he doesn’t see glass shards in his hair, so he takes it he hasn’t been thrown through another window. As he leads the psychiatrist outside, Jamie replies that, don’t get him wrong, it is a nice change of pace, but he was hoping for <i>more</i> out of life than not being <i>defenestrated</i>.</p><p>A moment later, the two find themselves in the sublevel of the polar bear section, where they can view the subsurface of the polar bears’ diving pool. One such polar bear dives below the surface, eying the two inquisitively. Regarding the bear, Jamie remarks that he read that, within a few decades, polar bears might be extinct ‘cause of global warming, courtesy of mankind. Asked how he feels about that by Samson, Jamie replies that it sucks. For one thing, what’ll they use to sell “Coca-Cola?” Rejoining that that’s the true tragedy, Samson then asks him to <i>come on</i>. His gaze still fixated on the polar bear, who returns the stare, Jamie admits he thinks it shows that things of beauty can be hurt without anybody intending to.</p><p>To this, Samson asks Jamie if he thinks if that is what he believes he did with Theresa and Monet. Jamie does not reply, however, as his attention is fixated on his hand, which reaches out and presses against the glass holding back the water and separating he two from the polar bear. Almost in mirror image, the bear extends one of its paws, touching the glass in the same way from the other side.</p><p>When Samson repeats his name inquisitively, Jamie adds that it’s just that… He feels like he’s all <i>over</i> the place. <i>Literally</i>. And because his life is out of control, the <i>team’s</i> out of control. The widening gyre, center cannot hold, that whole thing. He needs to pull it together, but he doesn’t know how.</p><p>Leaving the section and entering the monkey area, Samson asks Jamie in what respect his life is out of control. In response, Jamie asks if he means aside from finding out he’s not technically a mutant, but part of this… this “other race”… and he’s not even sure what that <i>means</i> yet? Besides that, Samson replies. Well, Jamie begins, his dupes are literally all over the place. It’s like they’re running the show and he’s playing catch-up and damage control. One’s apparently working for SHIELD, of all things. And there’re others he sent out in his “great Odyssey of learning” who still haven’t come back…</p><p>Considering this as they view some chimpanzees, Samson suggests that that’s certainly a place to <i>start</i>, isn’t it? At first not following, Jamie suddenly does. He means get himself together by doing that <i>literally</i>. Go out and gather up his stray dupes. When Samson confirms, Jamie replies that he thinks he’s right. How can he be in charge of anyone else if he’s not in charge of himself? It might be tricky, Samson then adds. From what he’s said, his dupes can be unpredictable. To this, Jamie asks what’s the worst that can happen? A moment later, an immense SPLAT! resounds, as something impacts the glass between the chimps and the two. Though Samson recoils in reflect, Jamie does not flinch, but continues to look forward in near-shock. Grimacing slightly, Jamie remarks that no monkey’s ever thrown <i>excrement</i> at him before. When Jamie then asks him if he thinks that’s an omen, Samson replies that they should hope not.</p><p>Heartened by his conversation with Samson, Jamie feels that he now has a new purpose. A focus. Rather than returning to X-Factor HQ, he decides that it’s best to start immediately. Hell, he thinks, probably smarter to stay away until things cool down. The girls can handle anything that comes up, he’s sure. He means… it’s not like they resent <i>each other</i> over what happened. That would be silly.</p><p>Inside the main room in X-Factor HQ, Theresa and Monet sit in silence, Theresa at a table and Monet at the counter. Each is engrossed in reading, Monet with a copy of Vogue and Theresa with a newspaper. Though just a short distance separates them, a gulf of hostility exists between. Through this sea of enmity Layla Miller enters and ponders. Considering the situation, she regards Theresa and Monet with pursed lips and her hands on her hips.</p><p>A moment later, much to Monet’s surprise, Layla positions herself behind her chair and pivots it around so that Monet is facing Theresa. Monet begins to protest, but is silence by an emphatic “<i>Shut Up!</i> from Layla. Before Monet can recover, Layla moves to Theresa’s chair and repeats the maneuver. Moving between the two, Layla begins to gyrate her arms as she scolds the two.</p><p>They both feel used, she tells them. Fine. She <i>gets</i>that. But Jamie, he’s all… all. And they are so… and she <i>knew</i> it wouldn’t end well, but he made them feel good for awhile, right? And… and… just… just… Just <i>stop</i>, she finally says. Okay?!? If they can’t stop being mad at Jamie, at least stop being mad at each <i>other</i>, ‘cause she hates how it is now, and if it doesn’t change… then <i>she’s</i> gonna <i>make</i> it change.</p><p>Her piece said, Layla turns around and storms out, much to the dumbstruck surprise of Theresa and Monet. Once again alone, the two regard each other silently, sizing each other up. Deciding to break the silence, Monet unenthusiastically asks Theresa if she wants to go shopping or something. Incredulous at this, Theresa in turn asks if <i>that’s</i> her answer to this? Shopping? When Monet replies with a “yup,” Theresa replies that of all the… that is the most… Where was she possibly thinking of shopping? <i>Paris</i>, Monet replies simply. She can have a chartered jet ready to go in half an hour. Considering it for a moment, Theresa tosses aside her newspaper as she rises. “Yeah, all right,” she says.</p><p>Approaching an immense building, Jamie Madrox considers its occupants. SHIELD. Central Headquarters of the Super-Hero Internment, Elimination and Licensing Division. That’s not what it <i>actually</i> stands for, he muses, just what it’s <i>become</i>. And he – or more accurately, one of his dupes – is an agent there. The dupe confused the hell out his people when he came to sign them up for the Registration Act. “His people,” he thinks somberly. He wonders if he even has “people” anymore.</p><p>Though lost in thought, Jamie strides into the building as if he belonged, dressed in a suit befitting an agent of SHIELD so that he looks as such as well. However, entering the expansive main foyer, Jamie Madrox is unsure of where to go next. Sensing this, another agent approaches him, asking him if he’s okay. He seems a little confused. Trying to rebuff the question, Madrox replies that he just has a headache. Feeling dizzy… got kind of turned around heading to his office. To this, the other agent remarks that he doesn’t blame him. He’s been there two years and he still gets confused. Poking his thumb over his left shoulder, the agent tells Madrox that his office is down there. Third door on the right.</p><p>Remarking that he <i>thought</i> that was it, Jamie thanks the agent and heads to that direction. A few moments later, he opens a door, only to find a pair of hand-held automatic rifles pointed at him. Almost trying to think of something clever to say to this, he remarks, “Hey, there.” When someone from beyond the two gunmen says, “Hey, yourself,” Jamie immediately recognizes the voice as belonging to Val Cooper. Sitting at the edge of the desk in the room and flanked by two other armed SHIELD agents, Val Cooper confirms with a smirk. Val Cooper. His old boss, back in the day.</p><p>Flabbergasted, Jamie asks Val if she’s with SHIELD now, to which Val quips with a wry, <i>Nooo</i>. She’s still with the Office of National Emergency. She had a meeting there… Luckily for him. They were ready to drop him the <i>second</i> he bluffed his way in. She talked them out of it. When he then asks her if he’s that transparent, she replies that he makes cellophane look opaque, for God’s sake. This is SHIELD, she tells him, not Wal-Mart.</p><p>Pressing her point, Val moves around the desk, asking Jamie if he seriously thinks they didn’t make <i>allowances</i> for the fact that their Madrox isn’t unique? He has a subcutaneous I.D. chip so they know it’s him. Remarking to this, Jamie quips that, when it comes to him, she knows zilch. His dupes, he tells her, are becoming unstable. She needs him to take the one they’ve got off their hands, before it’s too late. Undeterred, Val informs Jamie that the only reason he’s not in jail is because of her. She’s been running interference between the feds and his agency, out of a sense of… she doesn’t know. Call it old time’s sake. She thinks he has a lot to contribute. But she can’t protect him forever. When he then rejoins that he doesn’t need her protection, Val retorts that he does. More than he knows. And stay out of SHIELD’s way, she then adds. Got it?</p><p>Without missing a beat, he says her name inquisitively. “Val?” When she responds, he Jamie Madrox narrows his eyes, tersely fixating them deeply into hers. This was really special, he tells her. “Let’s do it again soon.”</p><p>A few minutes later, Jamie Madrox is walking along the street, away from SHIELD HQ. Well, they didn’t go for the “dupes becoming unstable” thing, he laments, even though it might be more accurate than even he wants to know. Maybe he did underestimate them, he then ponders. But <i>they</i> underestimated <i>him</i> as well. He has a low-level psychic link to all his dupes. He can track one to a general area by concentration… and the closer he gets, the more he <i>knows</i> it. He was there in the next room, Jamie thinks of his SHIELD agent dupe. In the next room or somewhere close, and that means…</p><p>Madrox’s thoughts are interrupted by the calls of a young girl, calling out “Excuse me, mister.” Turning to her, he apologizes. He was having am inner monologue. When this only serves to confuse her, he tells her to never mind. What’s up? Holding up her box, labeled <i>Girl Scout Cookies</i>, she asks if he would like to buy some. She has thin mints. Examining the box closer, Jamie informs the little girl that he had an overweight friend who ate a thin mints box every day. Never got thin. Why does she think that w…?</p><p>As she had interrupted his thought’s earlier, now the little girl’s box interrupts Madrox’s words, as a cloud of grey gas <i>fwoooof</i>s from it, knocking him out. Luckily for him, the little girl catches his, chiding him for being a “funny guy.” Addressing two men emerging from an unmarked white van, she tells them to <i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>. As they and a few other men in dark suits and dark sunglasses, the little girl calls someone on her mobile phone. She instructs the party on the other side to inform their leaders they have captured Agent James Madrox of SHIELD. They are on their way back to headquarters immediately to proceed with the plan.</p><p>As she enters the back of the van herself, closing the door behind her, she shouts to her men. “Well done! Hail Hydra! Let’s go.” So ordered, the van takes off, losing itself in the heart of the city.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Brief Description:</b></p><p>Rachel Grey takes a break from the scrutiny of the Sentinels stationed around the mansion to go and visit her grandparents. After a short time of relaxation, the Greys throw a party for Rachel to allow her to meet her many relatives. During the party, while dancing with his granddaughter, John Grey is attacked and killed before Rachel’s eyes. At the mansion, the staff and students are still attempting to stabilize themselves after the recent decimation that wiped out 90% of mutantkind. Cannonball manages to get in the way of the Sentinels while flirting with Betsy, and Nightcrawler receives a surprise phone call from his “daughter” TJ. Across the estate, the team attempts to regroup and recoup, while Scott and Emma host Val Cooper and her entourage. Val attempts to explain that the Sentinels and the Office of National Emergency are here to help protect the X-Men during this time of global uncertainty. Emma and Scott are understandably less than trusting and the tension in the room is high, but the meeting ends without incident. It appears that the Sentinels are something the X-Men are going to have to get used to…</p><p><b>Full Synopsis:</b></p><p>Rachel Grey is from the future. In her childhood she saw nearly all of the X-Men murdered…some mutants she helped hunt down and kill herself. It’s what she was trained to do. She lived in concentration camps, and each morning she awoke to the sight of the guardian Sentinels looming over the grounds.</p><p>Rachel is enraged by what she sees in front of the X-Mansion today…it reminds her so vividly of that other life…Sentinels guards surrounding the estate. It’s more than she can handle. For mutants, the world has suddenly become a frightening and deadly place. One morning, a huge percentage of the world’s mutant population lost the DNA sequencing that made them mutants. Rachel senses that this “M-Day” is just the beginning…of what she doesn’t know. The remaining mutants are scared, the feds are scared…and the X-Men are left in the middle, committed to peace. It’s too much for Rachel to deal with.</p><p>With her teammates’ help, she sneaks off campus to visit her grandparents. She has family now and it is high time she gets to know them. She promises Kitty that she will keep in touch with the team and heads out. The time away is like medicine…exactly what her sick soul needs…she is enjoying her vacation immensely.</p><p>One afternoon, Rachel and her grandfather square off in a game of one-on-one basketball. When the competition heats up however, Rachel goes “teke” and puts the ball through the net. Her grandfather jokingly reprimands her, but is interrupted by his wife, Rachel’s grandmother, who comments on how spectacularly they both played. Rachel’s laughter reminds Elaine of days gone by and she becomes nostalgic.</p><p>As Rachel and John start up another game, Elaine wanders back into the kitchen to continue preparing for company. She silently curses Charles Xavier for taking away her daughter Jean. She wants to enjoy her grandchildren, but she misses her daughters so much. Her melancholy is so intense that Rachel can’t help but pick up on it. The game stops and Rachel is saddened that she reminds her grandmother so clearly of her life’s losses. John Grey refuses to let his granddaughter sulk and drags her into the car for a road trip.</p><p>Back at the mansion, Betsy Braddock heads out for her daily run. Life is full of coincidences, but in her case it is amazing that within days of her resurrection, the world begins to fall apart. Before she begins the run, she limbers up, but a warning call comes from a Sentinel telling her that she is too closeto the perimeter. Betsy merely suggests that the Sentinels step off the property and solve the problem themselves.</p><p>To further “bother” the soldiers running the mammoth machines, Betsy begins a seductive stretching routine in direct eyeshot of each of the Sentinel guards. It is a tactic that always works for her. Get her opponent focused on her body and they will almost always forget about the deadly warrior that lives inside…</p><p>From a pier on the lake, Cannonball and Nightcrawler comment on Betsy’s effect on the Sentinels. She has held the attention of each one of giants for the last hour. Kurt’s phone rings, and Sam blasts off to see Betsy.</p><p>Kurt is pleasantly surprised to hear his “daughter’s” voice on the other end of the line. TJ is calling out of concern because she too has seen the news broadcasts of the Sentinels posted outside of the mansion. Kurt assures her that everything is as well as it can be. She should stay in London with Captain Britain. The X-Men can handle themselves.</p><p>Sam, meanwhile, has reached Betsy who is floating serenely in the air in front of the Sentinels. He blasts by Betsy and nearly knocks her out of the sky…<i>Caught’cha nappin’ Betsy…</i>Psylocke protests that she was meditating, but before she can say anything more, Sam has doubled around for a second pass and buzzes by her again. Psylocke comments that she doesn’t remember Sam being so fast. Just to prove her right, Sam doubles back again and buzzes in for a third pass. This time he grabs Betsy in his arms and brazenly asks for a kiss. Psylocke responds with a direct kick to the solar plexus and is launched directly at one of the Sentinels.</p><p>The robot extends its hand and catches Sam as it cautions him to stay out of restricted airspace. Sam protests that he didn’t do it on purpose…what are these monsters anyway…the X-Men’s hall monitors? Psylocke tells “mountain boy” that he’ll be okay…</p><p>In the carriage house, Bishop surveys the global situation by means of Tessa’s cyber-network. The news is bad everywhere. Storm was in Africa when M-Day hit and has not returned. Vange Whedon and her ward Marie D’Ancanto have taken up residence in her loft. Vange is a mutant-rights lawyer who, thanks to M-Day, has lost nearly all her clientele. And the government is leaning toward infringement on the rights of the remaining few more casually every day. Marie predicts that with the X-Men locked up by Sentinel guards, mutants who are now powerless may find themselves becoming helpless victims of anyone who wants to get even with them.</p><p>Meanwhile, in one of the X-Men’s conference rooms, Scott and Emma welcome Val Cooper and her government entourage. Val is appropriately sympathetic although she admits that she cannot empathize with the heroes’ situation. She introduces Colonel Reyes, head of security for the mansion, and Dr. Senyaka from the Center for Disease Control who immediately asks if the team has made any progress in determining the cause of this affliction. Scott and Emma reply that they haven’t but they are working on it.</p><p>As the conversation continues, Emma moves herself and Scott onto the astral plane to allow them to communicate in private about what is going on. Something is shielding everyone’s thoughts from Emma. She cannot read Val’s or anyone else’s mind. Emma can’t say if this is caused by a device or something else entirely…Dr. Senyaka throws an oddly confident smile at Scott and he wonders if even thought they can’t hear their visitors’ thoughts, perhaps their visitors can hear theirs.</p><p>Val continues the conversation by recommending that Emma call off her lawyers. Emma counters by suggesting that Val call off her Sentinels. Colonel Reyes interrupts with questions about Cerebra. Can this device track down former mutants? Emma insists that Cerebra will be of no use finding mutants that no longer posses the X-gene. The colonel instantly asks about back up records and last known addresses from before M-Day. Dr. Senyaka states that it is standard disease protocol to track all potential vectors.</p><p>Scott silently cues Emma that he deleted all the information from the computer’s memory. He lies and tells the doctor that Cerebra’s files were damaged in the recent power overload and that the contact information is no longer available. The tension grows palpable, and Scott punts: <i>We knew a Cecelia Reyes…</i></p><p>The colonel grows visibly more tense as he explains that Cecelia is his kid sister. She joined the X-Men and he never heard from her again. He abruptly begins to list the ground rules that the X-Men will follow until this “emergency” has passed. All residents are free to come and go, but the colonel reserves the right to send a Sentinel to accompany any mutant leaving campus. Emma responds that he only has five, but the colonel bats it back by asking her if she would like him to deploy a Sentinel for each of them…</p><p>Val closes the meeting by reminding Scott that they are here to help. The president considers mutants to be a strategic asset, and it’s in national interest to keep those assets safe. <i>Keep reminding yourself…we’re the good guys, Emma…</i></p><p>Back in Annandale, John and Rachel finish their road trip with a little grocery shopping. Rachel’s uneasiness becomes clear to John when he notices her staring at the photo of a Sentinel on the cover of a news magazine. He’s noticed that she tenses up every time she sees those robots, but all she’ll share is that the robots she knew weren’t friendly. John tries to soothe the young girl’s survivor’s guilt, but Rachel’s issues run deep…she can’t open up to him.</p><p>Later that night, Rachel chats on the phone with Kitty. Her grandmother has invited the entire extended family and she is a nervous wreck. Aunts, nieces, cousins…the house is bursting with relatives. In the future that is Rachel’s past, these people were all killed before she could ever get to know them. Now that she has the chance, she’s not sure she wants it…she wishes aloud that Kitty could come, but then jokes that with the driveway full there would be no place for her to park her Sentinel…Kitty makes Rachel promise to have fun, and says that they will talk later. Encouraged blessed little by Kitty’s pep talk, she steps out into the bustling crowd of company.</p><p><i>Hi…I’m Rachel…</i></p><p>Outside the house, in the dark of night, someone is watching the Grey household.</p><p>Unaware of any possible danger outside, Rachel is actually enjoying herself. She has met so many people…good, bad, and ugly…but they’re all family. Two relatives named Fred and Russell begin a conversation about mutant rights and concentration camps, and Rachel can’t help but sarcastically suggest that perhaps they should brand mutants with a big “M”.</p><p>A friendly young man swoops in and pulls Rachel from the conversation and escorts her away from the heated conversation onto the snow covered deck. He introduces himself as Terry Maguire, and there seems to be a bit of interest between the two. Before they can chat any more, Rachel’s grandpa shows up asking for a dance with his granddaughter. Rachel is embarrassed and telepathically tells him so.</p><p>He is amazed by her gifts and wishes aloud that they had known how to better cope when Rachel’s mom was alive. Rachel insists that they did a fine job…her mom saved the universe! John notices that Rachel is tense again, and she confesses that she doesn’t know how to dance.</p><p>Grandpa Grey places his arms around Rachel. <i>Then it would be my great pleasure to teach you.</i> Those are his last words.</p><p>In a flash of fiery fury, John Grey is blown to bits right before his granddaughter’s eyes.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Brief Description:</b></p><p>Rachel Grey is at a party in Annandale-on-Hudson with her relatives. They are enjoying the friendly atmosphere and catching up with the gossip, when the Shi’ar Death Commandos attack. The swiftness of their assault catches everyone by surprise. John Grey is the first to fall, but many more follow in his footsteps. Rachel emits a telepathic scream, which is heard by several X-Men at the Institute. Nightcrawler grabs the nearest two people to him, Shadowcat and Psylocke, and teleports the fifty miles to the house. The commandos proceed to massacre Rachel’s family, and the four X-Men provide what resistance they can. After a brief but intense battle lasting only twenty-four seconds, Rachel is the last X-Man conscious. She is slammed into the ground by the Commandos’ leader, Black Cloak, who pours something from a small vial onto her back. It burns into her flesh, forming the symbol of the Phoenix. From this moment on, Rachel will be traceable forever.</p><p><b>Full Synopsis:</b></p><p>(Annandale-on-Hudson, New York)</p><p>A party is in full swing at the home of John and Elaine Grey. They don’t know it yet, but things are about to become really scary. Nine Shi’ar warriors are monitoring the guests, and they take stock of the surroundings and defensive capability of those inside. They find this to be negligible. Unable to locate their primary target, Rachel Grey, they opt for their secondary target, John Grey. He is eliminated with one blast from Warshot.</p><p>Rachel is a combat-trained telepath. She <i>should</i> have seen this attack coming. The commandos are there on the orders of the Majestrix Shi’ar to erase the Grey genome. They intend to kill everyone inside.</p><p>It takes three seconds for a spear thrown by Black Cloak to crash through the window and go straight through the portly Fred Harriman, an in-law of Rachel’s on her grampa’s side. He was a philosopher-braniac for a conservative ‘beltway’ think tank. Now he has a gaping hole in his chest. Rachel, blood splattered and shocked, only <i>now</i> realizes what’s going down.</p><p>By the fourth second, some of the commandos are entering the house. Bekka Wallis, Rachel’s cousin and a teacher from Chicago, was just showing off her fiancé. They’d just bought a house together and were planning on having kids. She is enveloped in a swarm of tiny creatures called Colony that eat away at her flesh.</p><p>Rachel screams, and her telepathic distress call is heard at the Xavier Institute by Cyclops and Emma Frost. It’s also heard by Nightcrawler, Shadowcat and Psylocke. In the next three seconds, Sega is ordered by Black Cloak to secure the Grey’s home. Nobody comes in <i>or</i> out.</p><p>Phyllis Dennefer was Rachel’s gramma’s sister. When they were Rachel’s age, they snuck into the Plaza Hotel to see the Beatles. Gramma got a kiss from John Lennon. Aunt Phyllis lived around the corner from the Dakota. She was home the night John Lennon was murdered and heard the gunshots.</p><p>Her husband, Roy, had done two tours in Vietnam and taught at West Point. He’d also led troops in Desert Storm and was scheduled for deployment back to Iraq. They are outside the Grey’s home, waiting to go in, unaware of the danger inside. At the Xavier Institute, Nightcrawler realizes the urgency of the situation. He teleports, grabbing Kitty and then Psylocke, despite her wearing only a dressing gown.</p><p>After eight seconds, Warshot murders the Dennefers. Rachel’s Uncle Roger, a jazz cornet player, is killed when the sole female warrior, Hypernova, throws her energy daggers at him. The glowing white weapons fry his torso. Nightcrawler, Shadowcat and Psylocke appear on the Grey’s roof just in time to see the Dennefer’s fall, and just <i>before</i> the defensive shield is made operational. Kitty says they need more guys.</p><p>Only nine seconds has passed. Psylocke asks Kitty if she has a plan. “We save...” she replies, as she witnesses Kurt’s teleportation attempt fail. Sega’s forcefield has been switched on and it does its job in keeping anyone from leaving.</p><p>After seeing John Grey evaporated right in front of her, Rachel may be shocked, but her shock turns to anger. Now it’s <i>her</i> turn.</p><p>During the next three seconds, Psylocke appears next to Warshot with her psychic knife at the ready. Inside the house, Devo encases young Julian in a bubble and uses some form of gas to eat him instantaneously. Kitty sneaks up behind him with a baseball bat.</p><p>Fourteen seconds, and Rachel is entering the house. Psylocke is noticed and attacked by Warshot, who shoots at her. Fortunately, Nightcrawler manages to ‘port her away from danger just in the nick of time. Kitty slams the baseball bat into Devo’s back and he falls.</p><p>A second later, and Rachel is using her telekinesis to disperse Colony who has devoured Terry Maguire. He had eyes that sparkled and a smile to die for when he looked at Rachel only minutes earlier. They had only five minutes together, but for a telepath that can feel like a lifetime. He was going to call her tomorrow and invite her to the movies. He wanted to kiss her but now, after trying to save his kid brother, he lies dead beside him.</p><p>Nightcrawler appears with Psylocke right above Warshot, and Betsy wastes no time in plunging her psychic knife into their attacker’s face. For Kitty, her resistance came too late for Julian, and the pressure’s beginning to show.</p><p>Rachel sees her Uncle Liam, Pastor Liam, who has met the same fate as Terry Maguire. He loved Keats, Dylan Thomas and James Joyce. He had a voice like honey and his sermons were a celebration of language as well as faith. Nightcrawler and Psylocke teleport into the thick of the action. They can’t evacuate, so they <i>have</i> to win.</p><p>One of the commandos, Krait, who looks like a human-sized Eagle, tears through a vehicle outside and attacks Rachel’s cousins, Mary-Margaret and Kindra. They had talked with Rachel about boys, fashion, music and scandal and concluded that she was woeful about them all.</p><p>Rachel realizes that Kitty is in danger from Offset, a bug-like creature that catches Kitty by surprise. She asks Kurt to save Kitty, and also asks Psylocke to cover her gramma. Betsy replies that she has her, but she is enveloped by a hulking stone-featured creature named Shell. At least it keeps the creature away from Derry Campbell, another of Rachel’s cousins from Texas.</p><p>After nineteen seconds, Rachel Grey flies into the air to take out Krait with a telekinetic blast, but manages to slam them both against the forcefield in her fury. Psylocke, seemingly helpless, is confronted by Hypernova, who holds out her own energy dagger at Betsy’s face. Psylocke it seems isn’t as helpless as expected, and she generates her psychic knife from her left fist. She thrusts it through Hypernova as Shell crumbles around her. Offset takes Kitty and plunges something resembling an organic syringe into Kitty’s stomach. It has locked her solid and intends to feast on her body.</p><p>After twenty-one seconds, Nightcrawler is on the roof after saving Kitty from Offset. He tells her to remain on the roof where it’s safe. “Like hell!” she replies. At that moment, Rachel and Krait crash to the roof unconscious, knocking out Kurt and Kitty at the same time. Psylocke stands over her downed opponent, but is slammed unconscious by Black Cloak. Rachel manages to pull herself to her feet. She apologizes, even though there’s nothing to apologize for. Black Cloak recognizes her as being the primary target. The mist-form of Sega informs him that she’s untraceable, but Black Cloak replies that she won’t be for long.</p><p>Rachel lets loose a burst of her telekinetic power at Black Cloak, but the warrior remains unfazed by her attack. He shoves her to the ground with his spear and pops open a small vial he’s carrying. One drop of a strange yellowish green liquid is all it takes. It drops on Rachel’s back, and begins to burn a strange symbol into her flesh: a simple image of a phoenix. Black Cloak then knocks Rachel unconscious. “She will never hide again.”</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>A Plague Among Us:</b></p><p>After attending to some business in Moscow, Phoenix, Beast, Storm, Cable and Gambit are attacked by a mind-controlled Darkstar, their friend from the Winter Guard. After freeing Laynia from the control cast upon her, they learn that she was investigating some strange occurrences on Rebirth Island at the request of some of the locals. Gambit flirts with Darkstar as the X-Men offer their help. Laynia teleports everyone to Rebirth Island where they note the desolateness of the abandoned research station, until they are attacked by some droids. With the droids easily destroyed, the Black Death introduces himself and reveals his predicament, that the Russian authorities deemed his mutant power of influence too powerful, so they experimented on him with this virus. He is the one who mind controlled Darkstar into attacking the X-Men because he wants the Beast to help cure him of his condition. The Beast has no choice but to help him when the Black Death puts the others under his control. Beast begins his work while trying to call out to Phoenix, who is finally woken from her dream, and starts about setting the others free. The X-Men and Darkstar attack the Black Death and the “cure” that Beast was working on turns out to be stun gun, which knocks him out. Darkstar prepares to take him to the authorities so he can be helped and so they can all make amends for their wrong-doings, while the X-Men return home, everyone safe.</p><p><b>Garden State Slaughter:</b></p><p>Deadpool is in a bad state, and thinks back to a mercenary mission he was once on which involved a troubled young girl, who after he helped her committed suicide soon after. At the time he took full responsibility for her and buried her “Sandee Wade” along with some money which he swore never to use because it was blood money - but now he needs the money, and digs it up, hoping that Sandee will understand, after all, she is his family.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The story of Cassidy's first visit to New Orleans, and the only other vampire he knew.</p><p>After a scuffle with the local police, Cassidy makes his way to New Orleans where he meets Eccarius, who just happens to also be a vampire. This is the only vampire Cassidy has ever met, aside from the one that bit him 75 years prior. Eccarius speaks, looks, and acts as though he's straight out of a Anne Rice novel. Cassidy quickly realizes that Eccarius is a \"wanker\" after speaking to him. Eccarius offers him blood in a wine goblet and a place to sleep in a coffin, only solidifying Cassidy's belief that the only other vampire is a complete \"wanker\". The next night, Eccarius brings Cassidy to his underground sanctuary where the group \"Les Enfants Du Sang\" live. All of them are gothic rejects that all worship Eccarius and beg to drink his blood to become vampires. One of them is Roger who reads a long poem called, \"Eccarius Becoming (Loam Dreams)\". Cassidy tells them off and shoves Roger's poem down his throat while he and Eccarius leave the underground. After a heart-to-heart, the boys go to a church, Cassidy proves the myths about Vampires wrong. They go bar hopping, get drunk and then go back to the underground to call Les Enfants Du Sang \"wankers\" while mooning them. Cassidy wakes up the next night to find Eccarius missing. Cassidy tracks him down to a church and finds Eccarius feasting on a woman. Eccarius tells Cassidy he's murdered and fed on hundreds of people and kills everyone he feeds on. Cassidy shoves a cross through his head. Eccarius wakes up later, nailed down to a roof as the sun comes up. Cassidy tells him he's going to die for being a \"self-obsessed, pasty-faced death-fixated d!ckhead got up in a poncey suit.\" Eccarius' accent is gone as he yells at Cassidy before he dies.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><ul><li>Ranked #89 in Wizard Magazine's list of \"100 Best Single Issue Comics Since You Were Born\".</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>The first issue of the original Evil Ernie series.</p><p>Ernest Fairchild a very disturbed young man. Heavily bound and restrained he is a mental patient who is beyond the help of any normal method of psychiatric care. His mind is a turmoil of death and destructive fantasies. In his own head a beautiful woman called Lady Death rises from the grave before him and promises him eternal love if only he would destroy all human life on earth.</p><p>While under the supervision of armed guards he manages to break loose from his straight-jacked and chains, killing the guards brutally. Only Dr Price is robust enough to resist Ernie's rage and placing a gun to Ernie's head he has enough sense to stop before Price would be justified in pulling the trigger.</p><p>Bound again and in a padded cell Ernie's thoughts are of his parents. His seemingly normal and caring parents were violently abusive to young Ernie. Unsurprisingly Ernie becomes a problem child and is put into an experimental program where he is placed in a machine called the Dream Probe, meant to help him with his issues. Instead he dreams of his monstrous parents chasing him in a graveyard. In a flash of lightening Lady Death appears; a buxom goddess of a woman in scant clothing, pale skin and carrying a large scythe. She shows her love for Ernie by slicing his parents in two, drenching him in their blood. Ernie goes home seemingly a new boy.</p><p>This series would be reprinted in 1996 with new cover art and bonus artwork.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>In the fallout from HOUSE OF M and following last year’s surprise hit film-noir series-- MADROX, a new mutant team is forged! X-FACTOR is an investigative mutant agency including Madrox—the Multiple Man, Guido—the Strong Guy, Wolfsbane—the shape-shifter, Siryn—the chorus girl, Rictor—the living earthquake, and GENERATION X’s Monet—the pompous witch. Drawn together in the heart of District X, this rag-tag band of heroes has a lot of answers to find, and fast!</i></p><p><i>BONUS: A key player from HOUSE OF M will play a major roll in X-FACTOR! (No, it’s not Wolverine—sigh)</i></p><p><b>Issue Summary</b></p><p>Rictor stands on the snow-covered ledge of the building in Mutant Town that houses X-Factor Investigations. His breath hangs visibly on the air as he ponders his next decision.</p><p>Jamie Madrox AKA The Multiple Man provides the narration for this tension-filled scene. He explains that “X-Factor” refers to that unpredictable something. That unforeseen occurrence that changes everything in an instant. The things in life that you just don’t see coming. When that time comes and you don’t know how to handle it, that’s when you call X-Factor Investigations.</p><p>Jamie watches Rictor from a neighboring rooftop and wonders aloud what his old friend is up to. He wonders if this is a “cry for help” moment but decides that he doesn’t really believe in that and just finds this annoying. Still, since Rictor is a pal he can’t just stand around and do nothing. So Jamie does what Jamie does. He creates some dupes of himself to weigh his options. One particularly fatalistic dupe says it doesn’t really matter if he offs himself now since he’ll die in the upcoming nuclear holocaust anyway. Another thinks it should be Rictor’s choice and they shouldn’t interfere. Another insists that it’s too beautiful a night to die and that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Jamie decides that the last dupe has the right perspective to deal with the problem effectively. The dupe is enthusiastic about being chosen and rattles on about how appreciative he is.</p><p>Jamie orders the other dupes to toss the other across to the roof where Rictor is poised to jump. They toss the dupe who lands with a skillful roll. The real Jamie and the remaining dupes watch as the chosen dupe goes to talk down Rictor.</p><p>The real Jamie notes that the true problem with being a “multiple man” is that he can’t make up his mind on anything of importance since he can always choose every option by creating a new dupe to pursue each one that arises. No choice or direction is any more enticing since he never really has to choose just one.</p><p>The chosen dupe climbs down to where Rictor is contemplating his fate. He cheerfully says hello to Ric who asks what he’s doing there. The Jamie dupe says he’s there to keep him from doing anything stupid. Ric insists he not get too close and asks who sent him. The dupe replies that Rictor has made the nightly news. Ric looks down on the emergency crews and gathering onlookers and wonders if this is his fifteen minutes of fame. The dupe tells him that whatever it is, they can deal with it. Rictor explains that he’s not a mutant anymore and that that’s the one thing he can’t deal with.</p><p>Meanwhile at the Power Plant bar, Siryn is meeting with a young woman named Victoria. At Theresa’s request, Victoria has secured some information to help in taking down her boss, Mr. Manetta. Manetta was a con man whose schemes caused a lot of misery for the mutants in Mutant Town. Siryn tells Victoria that she’s done a great thing by taking this risk and that the lives of lots of people will be improved once Manetta is brought to justice.</p><p>Victoria reaches across the table and places her hand on Siryn’s as she confesses that she did it because of her love for the red-haired mutant. Theresa looks down in shock and gently removes her hand from under Victoria’s. She begins to say that Victoria will be joining the witness protection program and Victoria interrupts and asks if Theresa will be going with her. Siryn says that she never promised that. Victoria says she just assumed they’d be together given their feelings for each other. Siryn is thrown for a loop by this and tries to explain to Victoria that her feelings have to do with her voice. Victoria interrupts and gushes about how much she loves Terry’s voice. It’s then that Siryn notices that the pages Victoria brought her are blank. Victoria says this is impossible as Siryn realizes that it may mean someone may have switched them. Victoria panics as she realizes someone may be on to her.</p><p>At that moment, the windows shatter as a rain of machine-gun fires mows down Victoria. Siryn moves to Victoria’s side and tells her they’ll get an ambulance and she’ll be fine. She tells Victoria to stay with her but it’s no use. She dies in Siryn’s arms. In anguish, Theresa lets out a sonic scream of “NO!” that shatters all the glass in the area.</p><p>Back on the rooftop, Jamie’s dupe is surprised to hear that Rictor is now powerless and himself exclaims “No!”. Ric explains that 90% of the mutant population are now mere “saps”, homo sapiens. Jamie replies that he thought the popular term was “norms” and Rictor explains that he hates that terms because it implies that being human is “normal”. For him, normal was being a mutant and in perfect tune with the planet itself. He explains to the dupe that most thought he could just make the ground shake. In reality, he was linked to the planet and could sense every shift and movement in the earth around him. He could feel the planet’s power and now he feels like someone has stuffed his head in a bag. He confesses that before losing his powers, he pitied everyone a little bit because they didn’t experience the world like he did. Now, he’s no different than those he once felt sorry for except he knows exactly what he’s lacking in a way they never did. He ends by telling “Jamie” that he has no idea what it’s like to feel alone in a crowd. “Jamie” replies “You’d be surprised.”</p><p>At that moment, Strong Guy yells “Surprise!” as he leaps in front of the getaway car of the woman who shot up the Power Plant and killed Victoria. She manages to swerve out of the way but Guido grabs ahold of her bumper, which pops off as she speeds away. Siryn arrives and Guido expresses his relief to see that she’s okay since he saw the bar getting shot up. Siryn is clearly angry and tells Guido he was supposed to be providing back-up. He says that he was coming and that she had said show up at eight and that it’s only a quarter of. Siryn is still angry and tells him he could have known she’d get there early. Guido retorts that he’s Strong Guy not “Psychic Guy” and starts to ask why Terry’s so upset. She beats him to it and exclaims that Victoria is dead and that it’s all his fault. He tells her flat-out to go to hell and she says she’ll meet him there as soon as she’s cleaned up his mess. He twists the bumper angrily in his hands as she flies off.</p><p>Jamie watches his dupe talking with Rictor and says into his radio communicator that “he seems to have things in hand.” Jamie explains to his unseen ally that his dupe is keeping Rictor talking and no one jumps to their death in the middle of a sentence. He urges whoever he’s talking to to get there quickly nevertheless. Jamie notes that he himself has a perverse side that probably would commit suicide in the middle of a sentence just to be funny. Recently, his dupes have been manifesting as aspects of his own personality. This new aspect of his powers has him questioning the worth of “Jamie Prime” now that he’s providing himself with competition.</p><p>On the rooftop, Jamie’s dupe is explaining the dynamics of X-Factor Investigations to Rictor. He notes that he started out small with Strong Guy and Wolfsbane helping out part-time. Rictor is surprised to hear that Rahne is involved. “Jamie” goes on to explain that he recently got a million dollars and increased the size and scope of the operation. He won the million on a game show. When asked to “phone a friend” he called his dupes who were busily researching the right answers to the question. Rictor asks what the million dollar question was. “Jamie” tells him it was “Who wrote ‘Mefisto in Onyx’ and that he knew right away it was Harlan Ellison.</p><p>He goes on to explain how he’s been sending his dupes out to learn new things and how he’s amassed an array of knowledge and skills as a result. He tells Rictor he used the money to buy the building where X-Factor Investigations was set up. He also set up bigger offices and some apartments for himself and the new operatives he’s hired on. He admits that they aren’t up to code, but the authorities steer clear of Mutant Town or what’s left of it. Rictor jokingly refers to it as the “Great Power Outage of 2005” and asks why they aren’t investigating that. “Jamie” replies “Who says we’re not?!?” and divulges that they got tons of calls from ex-mutants and it’s one of the cases they’re working on. Rictor asks who exactly “we” consists of.</p><p>“Jamie” provides a quick roll call: Siryn, who has recently discovered she can use her voice to enthrall others to adore her when she is completely calm. He notes that it only works on humans but that they’ll gladly sacrifice themselves just like with the sirens of myth.</p><p>At that moment, Siryn catches up with the escaping shooter and uses her scream to drive her car into a light post. The woman gets out of the car, gun in hand. Siryn taunts her and begs her to try to shoot her. The woman refuses and turns the gun on herself to Siryn’s horror.</p><p>“Jamie” continues his roll call and mentions that M joined too. Rictor thinks he means the character from the Bond movies. “Jamie” clarifies that he means Monet St. Croix AKA M. Rictor seems put off by this, referring to her as “Supergirl-meets-Veronica Lodge” and notes that she looks down her nose at everybody. “Jamie” replies that it’s a really cute nose though. Rictor wonders if this is a sales pitch to try and get him to join. “Jamie” replies that they’d love to have him. Rictor reminds “Jamie” that he’s not a mutant anymore to which “Jamie” replies that 99% of detectives in the world aren’t mutants. Rictor says that he’s not a detective either.</p><p>As “Jamie” begins to reply, an amplified voice from below calls up to Rictor and calls him a “flaming idjit”. Rictor looks down and says a weak hello to Rahne Sinclair, who is standing down below with a megaphone. She is angry and asks him if he knows what’ll happen to him if he commits suicide. She heatedly explains (in exhaustive and gory detail) that it’s a mortal sin and he’ll spend eternity in hell being tortured endlessly by demons if he goes through with it. He meekly retorts that in Japan it’s regarded as an honorable death. Rahne does not let up a bit and asks him if this looks like Japan to him. She asks if he sees any Shinto shrines or if there’s a Toshiro Mifune film fest up the street. He admits that he doesn’t. She affirms that it’s because they aren’t in “Bleedin’ Japan!” She ends her tirade by asking if he knows where he is?</p><p>This same question is echoed by Siryn who is asking the same question of young Layla Miller who has just shown up at X-Factor Investigations. Siryn is sitting with her feet on the table staring at a shot of liquor she’s poured for herself. She asks what the girl wants and Layla introduces herself. Siryn bitterly says that she answered “who” not “what” and Layla asks the Irish mutant if she’s going to drink that. Siryn says no. She explains that she’s an alcoholic and only gets to stare longingly at it and dwell on the fact that a young woman is dead because of her. Guido chimes in and says that he thought it was <i>his</i> fault. Siryn apologizes for how she unloaded on Strong Guy, who says he’s been called worse (by her on occasion). He begins to explain that he has some info on the shooter, but Layla interrupts and finishes his sentence. She explains that the woman was an operative from Singularity Investigations, a security agency for the rich and famous. Guido asks who Layla is and how she knew this. Layla introduces herself again and announces that she’s joining the group.</p><p>Outside, Rahne continues to provide detailed descriptions of hellish torture via her megaphone until Rictor gives in. “Jamie” helps him to his feet and asks if he’s okay. Rictor says he guesses he is and asks if “Jamie” is the real thing or a dupe. He confesses to being a dupe and how Jamie Prime thought it best to send a more optimistic aspect of his personality to talk Rictor down. Ric doesn’t fully get it and the dupe goes on to explain that he’s not <i>really</i> the optimistic side of Jamie Madrox. Rictor seems surprised as the dupe explains that he just tricked Jamie Prime into thinking that. The dupe smiles widely and explains that he’s really the perverse side of Jamie’s psyche, the part that compels Jamie to do the unexpected. He draws Rictor in close and whispers to him that he’s the unpredictable side of Jamie’s nature, the fly in the ointment… the x-factor. With that explained, the dupe shoves Rictor off the rooftop.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Questions: What is the bizarre secret of Singularity Investigations and their boss, Mr. Tryp? Has Jamie Madrox turned homicidal? Who is Layla Miller and how does she know stuff? Who is Gloria Santiago and what's going on with her sister? Will Rahne give in to her temptation to kick Monet's butt? Can X-Factor's investigation of the \"Decimation\" possibly yield the mystery of the HOUSE OF M? Read X-Factor #2 and learn the answer to all, some, and possibly none of these questions!</i></p><p><b>Issue Summary</b></p><p>Protesters gather outside X-Factor Investigations. Inside, Siryn is determined to investigate the mysterious Singularity Investigations who were responsible for gunning down an important contact in X-Factor’s latest case. Layla Miller shuffles through office files as she cautions her against this course of action, bluntly stating that Theresa will meet with certain defeat in a one-on-one confrontation with Singularity Investigations. Siryn tries to brush this off with a bit of bravado, but the mysterious Layla Miller assures her that she won’t like what will happens if she tries.</p><p>Once again, Siryn and Strong Guy find themselves wondering who this odd young woman is who has so boldly inserted herself into X-Factor’s affairs. Layla tells them that the only way Singularity will take them seriously is if they manage to get their attention. She advises them to take on their next client who she predicts will arrive in a few moments worried about her sister. As Guido begins to shoo Layla out, Gloria Santiago arrives stating that she’s worried about her sister and needs X-Factor’s help. Layla simply smiles and pulls out a file she’s already created with the name “Santiago” on it. She states her name and once again that she “knows stuff” as she tells Gloria that X-Factor is eager to dive into her case.</p><p>At this same moment, Rictor plummets towards the ground after being pushed from a rooftop by one of Madrox’s dupe. Oddly enough, the dupe had just convinced Rictor not to commit suicide before shoving him off the roof. Seeing Ric falling, Rahne tries to force her way past a pair of police officers in order to save her former beau.</p><p>From nearby, Jamie watches in horror and wonders why his dupe would have done such a thing. Rahne transforms into her transitional lupine form and threatens the officers until they relent and let her go. She leaps into the air, fearful that she is too late to save Rictor’s life.</p><p>She slams into the building as Monet St. Croix arrives and catches Rictor herself. She tells Wolfsbane not to fear as she flies Rictor off for a private chat. As she departs, she comments wryly on the state of Wolfsbane fur and asks snidely if she’s trying out a new flea treatment. Rahne growls at her haughty new teammate.</p><p>The dupe who pushed Rictor tries to escape down an alleyway but is intercepted by the original Multiple Man, who was convinced that this was the optimistic side of his personality. He questions the rogue dupe about his actions and the boldly states that he’s the part of Jamie’s consciousness that tries to delude himself, the side of his persona that can’t be trusted. The dupe exults in being free and able to act independently at last and Jamie insists that he’s going right back inside. The dupe states with a smile that he can’t keep him trapped forever like a genie in a bottle. He tells Jamie that there’s no way he’ll know that it’s him either. Jamie draws the dupe back inside as the dupe declares “You’re not the boss of me!”. Jamie wonders aloud who it is then if not him and the dupe replies that <b>that</b> is the question.</p><p>As Jamie assimilates the errant dupe, a homeless guy asks if he’s still a mutant. Jamie answers in the affirmative and asks if the homeless man is too. He replies that God loves him and that he isn’t anymore. Jamie tells the guy to ask God what it is that he did to piss him off.</p><p>At the X-Factor offices, Gloria Santiago explains that her sister is a cleaning girl at an exclusive hotel called the Marquis and that she’s undergone a radical personality change and has become suddenly secretive. Guido asks bluntly why she thinks this is a case that merits X-Factor’s specialized services. Ms. Santiago suspects that an evil mutant is behind her sister’s sudden behavorial shifts. Siryn explains that the odds of this being the case have dropped dramatically since the events of M-Day and that any evil mutant left would likely be targeting world leaders not fooling around with the chambermaid at a hotel.</p><p>Layla interrupts and tells Theresa that if she wants to get to Singularity Investigations, Ms. Santiago’s case is the place to start. Guido asks how she knows this and Layla tells them once more that she’s Layla Miller and she knows stuff. Strong Guy asks what kinds of stuff and she replies “all kinds”. He asks how and she begins to say “Because…” and he finishes with an exasperated “…you’re Layla Miller.” She smiles and says he’s finally getting it! He replies that if she means a massive headache when referring to “it” that she’s absolutely correct.</p><p>Siryn agrees to take on Ms. Santiago’s case mostly due to her commitment to finding out the truth about Singularity. She asks Ms. Santiago for the information she has so far about her sister’s situation.</p><p>The scene cuts to a shot of the impressive skyscraper that houses the offices of Singularity Investigations. Siryn approaches and with a scream crashes through the office windows. As soon as she enters, she is enveloped by a null field that absorbs and deadens her sonic scream. She is quickly surrounded by armed guards who fire upon her, their bullets easily passing through the null field.</p><p>Turning from his desk, Mr. Tryp, the head of Singularity, notes that this would have been an exciting end to his day and asks why Siryn did not show up as expected. Hovering before him is a small glowing vision of the scene just described which he regards with great interest. He is speaking to a robed figure who looks like an ancient wizard complete with long green robes with gold trim and a stylized dragon logo.</p><p>The wizardly figure states that a new and unforeseen element has entered into events as he recalls them, clearly suggesting that he is from the future and for him the events leading to Siryn’s demise are past tense. Tryp demands more details but the old man is unable to provide them. He states that the period following the “decimation” of M-Day were a period of temporal confusion.</p><p>Tryp notes that there was great grammatical confusion as well given that the term “decimation” refers to the death of one-tenth of the population and the mutant population has been reduced by ninety percent. The old man dryly encourages Tryp to try arguing with the media.</p><p>Tryp asks if this will affect the important upcoming events involving Jamie Madrox, again indicating that the two share some knowledge of future events. The old man states again that he doesn’t know. Tryp reprimands him for picking now as the time for such uncertainty. He states that the older man had told him that X-Factor’s actions would lead to the re-empowerment of the disenfranchised mutant population. The old man states that this would naturally put them at odds with X-Factor but that this change in circumstances changes everything. X-Factor could now be responsible for maintaining the current status quo for mutantkind. Tryp suggests that any interference on their part could then result in them “slitting their own throats.”</p><p>The old man stoically states that this could be the case, theoretically. Tryp demands that his associate sort things out on his end and bring him more accurate intel. The old man reminds him to show some respect and that he is not a messenger boy. Mr. Tryp sarcastically restates his request and adds “pretty please with sugar on it.” As the old man vanishes to parts (or times) unknown, Mr. Tryp wonders aloud why being evil has to be so much work.</p><p>Back on the streets of Mutant Town, Rictor rides away on his motorcycle as M flies alongside him. She is relaxed, flying backwards with her hands clasped behind her head in a very nonchalant manner as the two move past a crowd of protesters. The signs of the protesters mark them as mutants who clearly want their powers and mutant status restored. As they pass, one ex-mutant shouts angrily to Monet asking if she has to flaunt her remaining powers. M callously replies that yes, she does.</p><p>As they move through the streets, Monet compliments Julio on his motorcycle and asks if she can have it if she’s not around the next time he needs a rescue. He comments on her attitude but she blows it off with another snide remark.</p><p>They arrive at the X-Factor offices and Ric comments on what a dump it is. M says that she’s done wonders at beautifying the interior. Ric asks how and she states that her mere presence improved the place. She begins to invite Ric inside but he hastily reminds her that he’s now powerless. She says that he’s still sharp-minded and quick and nearly as attractive as she is. She wonders where the downside is. He informs her that hanging around with mutants who still have their powers will only remind him of all that he’s lost. That and her boss, Madrox just tried to off him.</p><p>As he’s about to leave, Layla Miller comes out and gives him a coupon for a gas station up the street. He thanks her and rides off. M asks the odd young girl who she is and Layla responds “Layla Miller. I know stuff.” Snottily, Monet replies “How special for you.”</p><p>At the Marquis Hotel, Rachel Santiago knocks on the door of a famous actor named Vaughn. He states that the room is a mess and she smiles softly and states that an important star like him deserves the best. As she enters the room, he says that he does and grabs her forcefully from behind. She cries out as if surprised by this but then turns and lustfully pulls off her cleaning lady uniform. She notes that he clearly wants to get right down to it this visit, implying that this is not their first time together. From outside the window, Siryn clicks a picture on a tiny digital camera. She remarks that this hardly seems like a case of mind control to her!</p><p>Rictor pulls into the gas station to fill up with the coupon that Layla gave him. He can hear shouting from inside the station. A young man named Ronnie is arguing with his girlfriend who is apparently breaking up with him. From their argument, it’s clear that they were both mutants and she views their depowering as a blessing from God. Since he doesn’t see things the same way, she’s dumping him and he’s none too happy about this turn of events or losing his powers. He pulls out a gun and says that if they’re through it will be on his terms and that this way, she can thank God in person.</p><p>The woman tries to escape and runs towards Rictor begging him to call the police. Ronnie comes after her and Rictor hoses him down with gasoline. Ronnie aims the gun at Julio, telling him shouldn’t have interfered because he has no idea what it’s like. Rictor says that he knows all too well and warns him not to fire the gun. He does anyone and the spark from the hammer ignites the gasoline. Rictor and the girl ride away as Ronnie bursts into flames.</p><p>At X-Factor’s offices, Siryn shows Gloria Santiago the photos of her sister in the arms of the movie star. Gloria has a hard time believing her formerly modest sister capable of such a passionate tryst. Monet states that she doesn’t mean to sound unsympathetic, not that she is in the least but she hates her inability to hide it better, but that Ms. Santiago’s sister wouldn’t be the first girl to give it up for a major movie star. Rahne appeals to M to show a little compassion and M snidely replies that she’ll consider it once they get central air in the offices. Gloria hastily thanks them for the information, pays them and leaves. She passes Jamie in the hallway but she ignores him.</p><p>He enters the office and asks if that was a client. He then compliments Monet on the save earlier with Rictor. Monet asks where he’s been and why he pushed Julio in the first place. Jamie replies that he was trying to clear his head and explains that it was a dupe who pushed Rictor and that’s what he was trying to clear his head of. He says that it’s complicated as Rictor enters and suggests that they try and simplify it.</p><p>Later, Jamie reflects on how poorly things went in trying to explain things to Rictor and the others. He knows that they don’t trust him now and he can’t really blame them. As he ponders this Layla appears and tells him that he’s going to want to take the call when the phone rings. He asks who she is and how she knows and she repeats her mantra “I’m Layla Miller, I know stuff.” As Jamie asks who let her in, the phone rings.</p><p>Layla leaves to finish her filing as Jamie answers. On the other end, Gloria Santiago says that he has to help her. She is at the Marquis Hotel. Her sister lies in the bed, apparently shot in the chest. A police officer is standing with Mr. Vaughn who is wrapped in a sheet. He claims that he took the gun away after she fired it and she didn’t even struggle. The officer begins to read her her rights and states that she’s under arrest for her sister’s murder.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>With X-Factor’s forces divided between a client up on murder charges, riots in the streets of mutant town, and Monet doing a striptease, the only person who stands between a crippled Rictor and a would-be assassin is...Layla Miller?</i></p><p><b>Issue Summary</b></p><p>Siryn is asleep, dreaming happily of Ewan McGregor. She is talking in her sleep, commenting on how nice his light saber is and agreeing to swim down the toilet with him. She smiles and says softly that Liam is welcome to join them.</p><p>As she sleeps, Layla Miller creeps into her room with a flashlight and resets her alarm. A moment later, the alarm blares startling Theresa out of the dream. She lets out a short scream which shatters the glass face of the alarm clock. Jamie calls out from the hallway and notes that she’s awake.</p><p>Siryn asks how he knew and Jamie replies that all his Star Wars collectible glasses just shattered. Siryn tells him to grow up and he replies to get dressed, they have a situation. He tells her that Gloria Santiago has been arrested for killing her sister. Siryn is surprised and rubs the sleep from her eyes. Siryn says she’ll be ready to roll in five minutes and Jamie says he’ll warm up the car. Layla appears from nowhere and tells him not to bother. He asks why not and she simply replies, “You’ll see.”</p><p>Minutes later, Jamie is riding through the night sky clutching fiercely onto Siryn’s back. Jamie confesses to himself that he’s finding the prescient Layla Miller a bit disturbing. He wonders how she knows what she knows and is thankful that she’s on their side but questions how he knows this for certain.</p><p>At the Marquis Hotel, police have already roped off the crime scene and are questioning witnesses. Jamie jumps from Siryn’s back to the rooftop and she compliments him on his dismount. He notes that he spent two years training with the US Olympic gymnastics team… or at least one of his dupes did. She asks if there’s anything his dupes haven’t done on his behalf and he says “had sex”.</p><p>The roof door is locked and Jamie proceeds to pick it. Siryn asks if he’s serious about his dupes not having sex and he admits that they’ve been pretty active. She asks if he himself has been and he replies that he’s not sure. She asks what he means and he explains that he’s having a tough time remembering what he did and what his dupes did since memory is not linear for him. Siryn says that sounds creepy and Jamie agrees wholeheartedly.</p><p>At the crime scene, an officer questions the two and is about to block their access when Jamie produces a bar card and tells the man he’s the alleged perpetrator’s lawyer. This surprises Siryn. The officer denies them access to the crime scene but Siryn uses her voice to persuade him, throwing in several stereotypical Irish catchphrases. Jamie teases her about these and she tells him he’s walking home.</p><p>Inside the room, a detective is completing his questioning of famed actor, Jack Vaughn. Siryn interrupts and using her voice tries to force Vaughn to confess what really happened. She is stopped by Damian Tryp, Jr. of Singularity Investigations. He warns the detective of Siryn’s mutant powers and advises him to wear earplugs as he and his men escort her and Madrox out. He identifies himself to Siryn and gives her his business card.</p><p>Back at X-Factor’s offices, Rictor hears something happening outside and goes to check it out. He finds a small gang of thugs assaulting a former mutant. Rictor confronts them and tells them if they’re looking for trouble, then they’ve found it. The leader asks who’s going to give it to them. Guido steps from the shadows and says he loves a great entrance line like that.</p><p>The gang leader tells him to stay back and calls him “freak”. Guido says menacing “You talkin’ to me?” and Rahne appears in wolfoid form and says she thinks they were talking to <i>her</i>, as she lunges at them with fangs bared. The gang runs away and as Rahne is examining their victim, they hear the thugs screaming from around the corner. Rahne initially doesn’t care and is more concerned with their former mutant victim. But Guido convinces her to come with him to check it out. Since he has no powers to help, Rictor volunteers to see to the guy who got beaten up.</p><p>Inside, Monet is complaining about the condition of the building again as she gets ready to take a bath and the handles come off. Layla enters and asks what the problem is. Monet snidely outlines the current problems: why is she still here? When will she learn to knock and the fact that the faucet just came off of her tub. Layla doesn’t miss a beat telling Monet that she’s here to help, the door was open and that those are just the handles, the faucet is the thing the water comes out of. Monet sighs and says that if she wants to help then she can fix the tub and call her when it’s fixed. Layla smiles and eagerly gets to work.</p><p>Outside, Rahne and Guido discover a full-blown riot in Mutant Town started by “The Reals”. “Reals” refers to those humans who have chosen to persecute former mutants now that they no longer have the power to fight back.</p><p>Elsewhere, Siryn and Madrox meet with Gloria Santiago, who states that she has no idea what happened. She remembers going to the hotel to confront Jack Vaughn for taking advantage of her sister. She remembers him opening the door but everything after that is a blank. Jamie asks Siryn whether she thinks Gloria is in shock and Siryn counters that perhaps Singularity had her mind-wiped by a telepath. Jamie asks if she really thinks Singularity has those kinds of resources and Siryn tells him she got a vibe off of Mr. Tryp Jr. that tells her there’s more to them than meets the eye. She knows they clean up the messes left by the rich and powerful but senses there a bigger agenda behind their actions. She also reminds him that they owe Singularity some payback. Jamie suggests they bring Monet in to scan Gloria’s mind.</p><p>Monet is in her room dancing in a short silk robe and nothing more with headphones on. The song is “I’m Too Sexy” and she is singing along with it. As Rictor knocks on the door and asks if she has a minute, Monet sings the lyric “Oh yes, oh yes”. As Rictor enters, she sings “Too sexy for my robe” and throws it off. Rictor is pleasantly surprised to see a naked Monet “shaking her sexy butt on the catwalk”. He’s not as pleased when she notices him, picks him up and sends him flying into the hallway.</p><p>She angrily asks if anyone here knocks! He responds that he did knock and she replied “yes” when he asked if she had a few minutes. She argues that she had her headset on and he retorts that if he had X-Ray vision, he might have seen that, of course that would also mean he’d have already seen her naked, rendering the whole argument pointless to begin with. He gives up while he’s ahead and tells her he came to tell her there’s trouble on the streets and that Rahne and Guido could probably use her help. She slams the door in his face and he shrugs and says that she can explain herself to them later on why she didn’t give them a hand when they needed it.</p><p>Rictor makes his way downstairs and is blindsided by a punch from the guy he saved from the”reals” on the street. The punch knocks Rictor out and his assailant calls in to his boss, Mr. Tryp. He says that he has stolen a kitchen knife and will make it look like a suicide. Layla emerges from the doorway and says ominously, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”</p><p>Outside, the riot rages as tensions that have been mounting since M-Day finally boil over into violence. Guido takes on some of the bullying “reals” who retaliate and try and take him down. Rahne goes wild, clawing into the rioters indiscriminately. She jumps on Guido’s shoulder and yells out to the rioters to get out of Mutant Town. Guido adds “And stay out” and Rahne swears to God that they’ll kill them if they don’t.</p><p>Back at X-Factors offices, Rictor’s assailant reports to Mr. Tryp that he’s been spotted. He walks into the kitchen and finds Layla waiting for him. She tells him he’s wondering who she is, everyone does. She informs him that she knows who he is and that Singularity sent him. She knows that Singularity is aware that someone joined X-Factor who wasn’t supposed to and is screwing up their ability to read the future. She knows they suspected it was Rictor, who should have died perhaps but changed his mind and that he had come to finish the job. But they were wrong. She’s the one who joined up and is affecting the future.</p><p>The assassin hears this and pulls out a switchblade. Layla continues, telling him that she has to do this job, a job she hates. This job is to ensure that X-Factor doesn’t discover the truth behind the Decimation and that she must make sure that it sticks. She hates it because it means misleading X-Factor and that she lost her parents twice.</p><p>The assassin says that he’s about to put her out of her misery then. Layla tells him he’s not because of these and shows him the screws from Monet’s tub. He asks what that means and she replies “It means you’re screwed.” At that moment, the light fixture in the ceiling above him collapses and water from Monet’s tub comes rushing down on him along with the wiring from the light. He jeers that it missed him but a second later, he is painfully electrocuted.</p><p>Upstairs, Monet wonders why the lights went out. In the kitchen, Layla approaches the assassin with a flashlight. She tells him that he’ll be dead in five seconds when his heart gives out and that his mother will mourn his passing but his wife won’t. With his final breath, the assassin weakly asks who Layla is. She turns the flashlight up to eerily illuminate her face and replies sinisterly, “I’m Layla Miller. I <i>know</i> stuff.”</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Strong Guy and Wolfsbane square off against the police during the Mutant Town riots; Madrox, Siryn and Monet race time in a last ditch effort to prove their client innocent of murder; and Layla Miller fires a warning shot across the bow of Singularity Investigations. Plus, the shocking ending that will have the internet saying, \"Oh, they didn't just do what I THINK they did, did they…?\"</i></p><p><b>Issue Summary</b></p><p>The telephone at X-Factor Investigations is ringing incessantly, much to the annoyance of Monet St. Croix. She calls out to someone, <i>anyone</i> to answer the phone but finally relents and answers it herself. She floats in the air casually as she answers the call. It’s Madrox finally checking in. Monet tells him that the place is flooded, she punched out Rictor and the power is out.</p><p>As she floats through the office, she notes that the lights are coming back on. As she floats along, she notices a dead body on the kitchen floor. She is about to tell this to Madrox who tells her to shut up and listen. At the other end, Siryn asks again why they need Monet and Madrox has to tell her to zip it as well. He tells Monet to get to the police station right away so she can mind scan their client Gloria Santiago and get to the bottom of her sister’s murder. He tells her not to stop for anything.</p><p>When Monet asks what to do about the chaos in the office, Jamie tells her to have Layla deal with it. He admits that while the girl is weird, she does seem good at handling stuff. Madrox hangs up and Monet calls Layla into the kitchen. She flatly tells the girl she has to go out and that Jamie wants her to deal with the corpse on the floor. Layla is completely unfazed by this and simply replies “Okey-dokey.”</p><p>In Mutant Town, police and SWAT teams arrive in response to the mounting riot between Mutant Town’s residents and the band of “reals” who have come there to harass and torment them. Monet flies past the scene as Wolfsbane and Strong Guy address the assembled crowd and police. Guido introduces them to the gathered citizens as “Can-Crush-You-With-A-Glance Man” and “Once-Disemboweled-A-Fellow-Just-To-Watch-Him-Die Girl”. He gives them all a few seconds to digest exactly why they might be called that and what it means to their individual, long-term health.</p><p>Uptown at the police station, Monet, Madrox and Siryn review the current situation. Monet tells them about the riot and when Jamie asks why she just flew by, she reminds him what her boss told her, “Not to stop for anything.”</p><p>Siryn suggests that if he’s worried he could send some dupes to help out. Jamie says he has a better idea and sends Siryn instead. She agrees and tells them if they need her, just scream. Monet sassily says that that’s more her thing to which Theresa replies “Bite me.” Monet replies that that’s Rahne’s thing. Siryn throws this right back at her and sarcastically assures M that she’s sure that she will find her own thing one of these days.</p><p>As Siryn exits the police station, she is stopped by Damian Tryp, Jr. He compliments her on her strength and beauty and tells her that he’d hate for her to come to any harm. She asks if that’s a threat and he tells her it’s a “heads-up” and he thinks she’s on the wrong side. She tells him in no uncertain terms what she thinks: that Singularity serves the interests of slimeballs and hurts innocent people along the way and that she intends to change all that. As she flies off into the night sky, Mr. Tryp smiles and says “Finally, a girl I could bring home to kill Mom.”</p><p>Inside the station, M and Madrox discuss Gloria Santiago’s condition. Monet asks Jamie if she thinks that Jack Vaughn killed the sister. Madrox cites Occam’s Razor theory: that the simplest explanation is usually the one that’s correct. Monet notes that the simplest explanation is that Gloria killed her sister. Jamie begins to ask Monet to keep her psychic findings to herself and she finishes his sentence, adding in case the police are listening in.</p><p>He starts to ask her if she’d let him finish a sentence, but she interrupts and finishes that one too. She tells him her time is too valuable to waste and she moves closer to Gloria to begin her mental probe. She makes physical contact and Jamie asks if she has to for her powers work. She says she doesn’t but that for probes such as this it helps. As she probes Gloria’s mind, her eyes roll back in her head and turn dark. Monet starts to shake with fear and Jamie reaches for her hand to break the psychic rapport. Without breaking from her trance, Monet instinctively lashes out and punches Madrox. This generates a dupe who is unusually aggressive and tries to pick a fight with M. The real Jamie tells his “Fight Club” dupe to calm down and that M is on their side. The dupe tells Jamie that he’s always letting others push him around when he’s the most powerful mutant alive! He tells him that he finds the “real” Madrox disgusting.</p><p>Their argument is interrupted by the investigating detective. Jamie quickly absorbs his dupe and Monet claims they were just having a professional disagreement. The officer tells them to keep it down. He calls Jamie “counselor” and M asks since when is he an attorney. He replies since he passed the bar. He then asks if she found anything out. She tells him she’ll handle it. He asks what she means and she reiterates more firmly that she will handle it and it’s not up for discussion.</p><p>At Singularity’s offices, Mr. Tryp, Sr. tries to convince actor, Jack Vaughn to remain at their offices until the arraignment of Ms. Santiago. Tryp believes they can best protect him there. Jack reminds Mr. Tryp that he was voted number 3 on Premiere Magazine’s most powerful people in Hollywood list. Tryp feigns being impressed but Jack tells him that the studio wants him back on the West Coast right away. He throws in that as the customer, he’s always right. Mr. Tryp tells him that even a 300 pound woman in spandex thought she was right when she bought it and he should consider that. He wishes Mr. Vaughn a “Bon Voyage”.</p><p>Meanwhile in Mutant Town, Rahne and Guido face off against the police. Rahne and Guido tell the police to leave if they want to avoid further violence. Wolfsbane says that the “reals” came to Mutant town to beat up on former mutants and that she’ll see it end whether the police like it or not. The lead officer is not about to back down despite Rahne’s brusque and threatening manner. Guido tells Rahne to simmer down and the officer tells them that they do not get to control Mutant Town like their own private fiefdom.</p><p>Siryn arrives and tells him that they do, using her seductive voice to try and sway him. He’s not buying it and threatens her with a nightstick if she comes any further. Guido notes that her vocal persuasiveness isn’t working and she notes that his helmet and radio earpiece are probably blocking it. So she tries “Plan B”, which is basic assertiveness. She tells the cops to leave and to spread the word that Mutant Town is a haven for any former mutants who feel threatened or vulnerable and that X-Factor is there to protect them. He asks what will happen if they refuse and she simply replies, “I’ll scream.” Moments later, that’s exactly what she does, her hypersonic wail sends a wave of force through the streets so powerful that it knocks police cars on their sides.</p><p>At the airport, Jack Vaughn sits aboard a private jet from the movie studio where he is served by an attractive young waitress. He smiles at the pretty young woman, asking her to keep the drinks coming and to call him ‘Jack’. As he drinks his cocktail, he doesn’t notice as Monet flies up to his window and touches it. He leans back in his chair and tells the stewardess he could use a refill as he closes his eyes. She tells him she’s sure he could and that killing people is like eating potato chips, you can’t stop at just one.</p><p>His eyes open with surprise and instead of the cute blonde flight attendant; he sees the mutilated face of Rachel Santiago. He is shocked and in utter disbelief as he sees her and stutters out that she can’t be here. The zombie-like Rachel asks where else she would be, stating that she can’t visit her sister since she’s in jail for her murder. She tells Jack that they both know better though. She says that they also both know how Jack likes to play games with loaded guns and pretend he’s forcing himself on girls making them beg for their life. She tells him how this time he got startled when her sister, Gloria burst in and the gun went off. She reminds him how he thought quickly and contacted Singularity to cover it all up while Gloria was still in shock.</p><p>She cradles his cheek and he pulls away in horror. She whispers in his ear that they’re going to be fast friends now and she plans on sticking around all his life to remind him. He starts to call out “No!” and once more, he sees the flight attendant. He begins to rant that he’ll kill her again, no matter how many times it takes. Another member of the studio staff comes back and restrains Jack as he lunges for the stewardess making threats to kill her.</p><p>Later that night, Jamie Madrox is standing outside an electronics store and watching the news report of Jack Vaughn’s arrest as police wrestled the ranting movie star into a squad car. The news report suggests that Vaughn confessed to his culpability in the death of Rachel Santiago and that despite sparse details, it was expected that her sister Gloria would soon be cleared of all charges. As the clip concludes, Monet lands next to Jamie. The news moves on to the riots in Mutant Town and reports that no fatalities occurred thanks to X-Factor.</p><p>Police stated that they are happy to be working with the new organization which bears no ties to the mutant hunters or government team of the same name. Jamie continues to watch and notes what a night it’s been. He begins to commend Monet on a job well done and finally looks over to see that Monet has been deeply affected by it all. She begins to describe the things she saw in Gloria’s mind, the emotions she relived but then stops and begins to cry.</p><p>Jamie comforts Monet and realizes that he really doesn’t know how to handle women except when they’re trying to beat him up. Monet pulls away and through her tears tells Madrox that she’ll tear him in half if he tells anyone about this. Later at X-Factor’s offices, Jamie is shocked to fins a bill from a messenger service for one thousand dollars. As he asks himself “Why?” Layla Miller arrives from nowhere, fills his coffee cup and tells him it’s because they deliver anywhere and at anytime with no questions asked.</p><p>At that moment, security at Singularity Investigations receives a large crate. The security guard assures Mr. Tryp, Jr. that it doesn’t read as being dangerous or having any explosives inside. They are waiting for a crowbar to open it. Tryp tells them not to bother and pries open the crate with his bare hands. Inside is the body of the assassin they sent to kill Rictor wrapped in bubble wrap. The note attached says “Stay out of Mutant Town! XOXOXOXO X-Factor. Mr. Tryp, Jr. stares at it, his face showing no hint of emotion beyond a twinge of concern.</p><p>On the stoop outside X-Factor Investigations building, Rictor tells Siryn that someone tried to kill him. He tells Theresa that when he woke up the guy was gone and Layla said he just “packed up and left”. Siryn admits that the kid is weird and she’s heard that she “knows stuff”. Rictor hopes she knows why he’s still here. He confesses that he’s still feeling a bit sorry for himself and that he feels like he just wants to get drunk. Siryn tells him that’s no way to handle it and reminds him that she’s a drunk herself. Ric asks how she handles it then and she tells him she eats and invites him to get some breakfast with her. He declines and heads inside to fend for himself and she makes her way to the nearby café.</p><p>As she’s walking she feels a sudden sting in her neck and pulls out a dart of some sort. As she reacts to whatever was on the dart, someone clubs her over the head from behind. She falls to the ground and grabs her throat. A man steps into the light and stands over her before continuing to beat her with the club. As he leaves, he begins to whistle leaving Siryn’s unconscious body in the alleyway.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>An intense tale of a struggle for survival as a terrified, mute, and badly injured Siryn finds herself at the mercy of a demented captor...and her only hope of rescue is in the person of a powerless Rictor!</i></p><p><b>Issue Summary</b></p><p>Rictor enters a café in the wee hours of the morning in search of Theresa Cassidy AKA Siryn. The waitress tells him to sit anywhere and Rictor clarifies that he was just looking for a friend. The waitress asks how friendly he’s thinking since her divorce was just finalized.</p><p>He stammers a bit and explains that he’s looking for his friend who frequents the café for breakfast. He had passed on an invite earlier and changed his mind. He mentions Theresa’s name and the waitress immediately recognizes her as Siryn, the girl with the lovely voice. She shares how a cockroach once jumped out of her omelet and her startled scream shattered every glass in the place.</p><p>The waitress, Candy, tells Rictor that she hasn’t seen Theresa at all that morning and that she’d been there the whole time. Candy asks if Rictor thinks something bad may have happened to her and he assures her that Theresa is probably fine. Candy asks him to tell her “hi” when he sees her.</p><p>Rictor walks out into the morning rain and notes that it’s a straight walk from the X-Factor offices to the café and he would have seen Siryn had she headed back there. As he walks back, he wonders if she could have gone somewhere else and notes that he’ll find her cell phone number at the office and if that doesn’t help, he can use the x-shaped tracers that the entire X-Factor staff wears. As he walks past an alleyway, he fails to notice Siryn’s discarded X-tracer or the trickle of blood that flows into the gutter from the alleyway.</p><p>This same trail of blood leads to the back door of an abandoned theater in Mutant Town. Inside, a bespectacled and disheveled man sits on the edge of the stage threading a needle as he explains that it’s lucky he happened by when he did. He relates his story of how he was a doctor before his mutant powers emerged and his life was completed derailed and was ruined. This left him with nothing unlike many mutants with flashier mutations and now he doesn’t even have his mutant power anymore. What he does have is his medical kit, wits and now someone to talk to. As he says this, Theresa Cassidy, beaten and bloodied, sits in a front row center seat bound by cords and gagged with a fetishistic ball gag.</p><p>Siryn’s captor introduces himself as Doctor Leery and notes that he’s heard all the obvious jokes about his name. As he chats about these jokes, he gets closer to Theresa. She responds by kicking him square in the chest the moment he’s within range. Enraged, her kidnapper slaps her twice and calls her ungrateful for attacking him. He notes that she would be dead if it weren’t for him and that he reset the leg she just kicked him with. He says that he holds her life in his hands and is clearly intoxicated by the power that gives him. He grabs her forcefully and asks if she gets that. She looks up at him, her face bruised and the ball gag still in place. The look in her eyes speaks for her.</p><p>Dr. Leery apologizes and casually notes that he has anger management issues. He explains that that’s how his life became so filled with trouble. His mutant power only kicked in when he was angry and he lost it one night in the ER and things got bloody. Siryn strains against her bonds to no avail.</p><p>Dr. Leery notes how funny it is that he finally has someone here to talk with and he’s not in the mood. He steps down from the stage and removes the ball gag from Siryn’s mouth. She tries to speak but cannot. He notes that the wounds on her neck suggest someone paralyzed her vocal cords through a drugged dart. He shows her a scalpel and warns her that if she kicks him again, he’ll sever her vocal cords permanently. To drive his point home, he plunges the scalpel into her leg.</p><p>His point made, Dr. Leery spoon-feeds Theresa some vegetables from a can. He tells her he hated to do that since a doctor’s oath is to “first do no harm”. He asks her if she wants to live and she indicates that she does. He tells her that she can live there with him. He tells her that he finds the abandoned theater a great metaphor for the mutant race. Once thriving and magnificent, a thing of beauty, a work of art. But then the curtain fell and the drama was over. Despite great reviews, the show was over for mutantkind.</p><p>He tells her that he thinks X-Factor and the X-Men had something to do with all this. Siryn weakly tells him that he’s wrong and he disagrees. He says that he could survive as a mutant and now he doesn’t even have that! He places the scalpel on her neck and breaks the surface as he tells her that he wants to know who is responsible. He asks if it was her and she swears it wasn’t. He tells her that he once had great plans and now has nothing and that someone is going to pay for all he’s lost.</p><p>The doctor says that he bets she thinks he’s vermin but that he’s a person who once had dreams that have been squashed right and left. He needs something to hold onto and he’s picked her. He says that when a group suddenly loses power, you’ve got to look to those who still have it and wonder why and what’s in it for them. He says that kidnapping her might give her team some incentive to look into the source of the M-Day depowering. He says that a mere note asking them to investigate things might not get their attentions but one with a lock of her hair or a more significant body part might get them to do something.</p><p>In the alley where Siryn was attacked, Rictor finds her X-Factor communicator. He picks it up and looks around the alleyway. He finds a lock of Theresa’s hair on a chain-link fence. He looks concerned as he passes the stage door. Some instinct tells him to turn back rather than exit the alleyway.</p><p>Inside, Theresa swears that X-Factor doesn’t need incentive and they’ll find out what caused the power outage. She tries to convince him that they are there to help. He tries to get her to promise to restore things to the way they were and she says she can’t do that since there’s no way she can know how things will turn out. He says she’ll have to make the leap of faith with him and tells her to swear it on her faith and soul and all she holds dear.</p><p>As he says this, the scalpel gets closer and closer to her eye. Through a hoarse whisper, she tells him to go to hell and refuses to swear on holy things to make him think that she’s afraid of him. He tells her that she is afraid and she replies that he has no idea who he’s messing with. He says all he wanted was a little hope but if she won’t give him that he’ll take her tongue instead.</p><p>As he leans forward menacingly, Rictor calls out for Terry to see if she’s inside. Leery replaces the ball gag as Rictor enters the stage wings. As he enters the backstage area, Rictor realizes that calling out like that may not have been the smartest move. As he makes his way onto the stage, Leery sneaks up behind him. Rictor can hear Siryn who is bouncing up and down in her chair in an attempt to make some noise. As Rictor struggles to get through the heavy stage curtain, Dr. Leery raises his scalpel to stab Ric in the back. Rictor decides to simply crawl under the curtains.</p><p>In the theater, Siryn manages to get her hands loose and quickly removes the ball gag. She lets out a sonic scream which shatters Leery’s glasses and drives the fragments into his eyes. Rictor spins around and grabs Leery’s wrist. The two struggle for a moment for control of the scalpel as Leery threatens to kill them both.</p><p>He is ranting about how they stole his powers and life and how he wants them back. As they tussle, Leery gets tangled up in the ropes that control the curtains. They wrap around his neck.</p><p>Seizing the scalpel, Rictor cuts the rope and Leery is hoisted into the air as the sandbag hits the floor. Rictor finally gets the curtains open and sees Terry. He quickly leaps down to help her and asks if Leery did all this to her. She replies that she isn’t sure. Her voice is hoarse form the strain of the single sonic scream. Ric commends her on her timing. She tells him she hates playing the damsel in distress but that she can’t walk. He picks her up and carries her towards the door. Siryn thanks him and tells him weakly that she wasn’t afraid of Leery or of dying. Ric says that makes one of them. As he takes her out of the theater he tells her that “Candy says hi”.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>At last...some (or maybe all...or maybe none) of the mystery surrounding Layla Miller unfolds, as we learn things about her background that no one--not X-Factor and not the readers--will have seen coming. Plus: The aftermath of Siryn's brutal mishap, Guido goes jogging, and an unexpected doctor makes a housecall.</i></p><p><b>Issue Summary</b></p><p>The staff of X-Factor Investigations has gathered around their severely injured teammate, Theresa Cassidy. Siryn refuses to go to a hospital despite her injuries and the others try to figure out who is responsible for the beating she endured. They express concern that whoever attacked Siryn might try to finish the job if she’s admitted to a hospital. There’s also concern about how news of Siryn’s beating might impact the perception of X-Factor publicly, given that for many they are the last line of protection in a very hostile world following the effects of M-Day. The team talks about all of this as if Theresa isn’t even there, despite her efforts to remind them of her presence.</p><p>As they debate how to handle things, Rictor states that this is all Layla’s fault. During the entire discussion, Layla has been hanging back, silently listening to the others as a butterfly enters the room and lands on her finger.</p><p>Madrox attempts to assert himself in Layla’s defense and Rictor tells him to shut up. Ric points his finger accusingly at Layla and says that she came out of nowhere, claiming to “know stuff”. He’s convinced that she sent him to the gas station days earlier knowing that the girl he met there needed his help.</p><p>Guido tries to interrupt but Ric will not be deterred from voicing his suspicions. He goes on to note the way the assassin coming after him just happened to be in the right place at the precise moment to be electrocuted. Ric edges in on Layla and demands to know what’s going on and whether she knew what was about to happen to Siryn and if so, why she did nothing to stop it. Madrox steps in and begins to tell Rictor to back off when Siryn speaks up and says that she’d like to hear the answer to that herself.</p><p>Layla doesn’t respond. The butterfly is still perched atop her index finger as she turns and leaves the room. Before Rictor can go after her, Guido speaks up. He tells Rictor that he knows he’s angry about his power loss and that they all owe him for rescuing Siryn, but despite that if he doesn’t stay out of Layla’s face he swears that he’ll kill him. At this point, Madrox steps in and says that’s enough. He says that Siryn stays here and he’ll see to getting her some proper medical attention beyond the patch up job he did using his paramedic training.</p><p>Rahne goes to check on Layla who is sitting on the stoop outside. Rahne asks what she’s doing and Layla replies “Waitin’ for things to happen.” Rahne explains that she’s just returning from church and invites Layla to join her sometime. She asks Layla’s religion and the girl replies that she’s “between religions right now”. Rahne asks what that means and Layla shares that her parent died, she was orphaned and she’s got more pressing things on her mind than God at the moment.</p><p>Rahne starts to reach out and Layla interrupts, telling her about Siryn’s condition. Rahne asks by who and Layla corrects her and tells her the proper phrase is “by whom”. Rahne corrects her syntax and asks again who is responsible. Layla tells her that Rictor said that <i>she</i> is. Rahne declares this nonsense and that Rictor is being a jerk and Layla admits that he’s right. Rahne is shocked and asks if she truly was the one who hurt Siryn.</p><p>Layla has no time to answer. At that moment, Mrs. Charnoff from St Joan Orphanage arrives to bring Layla back where she belongs. She says that Layla called them and they’ve been worried since her sudden disappearance. Layla admits to Mrs. Charnoff that she ran away but that X-Factor has been looking after her. She introduces Rahne to Mrs. Charnoff, who expresses her relief. Rahne is confused and asks for some clarification on Layla’s situation. Mrs. Charnoff puts her arm around Layla and explains that Layla’s parents died in an auto accident and that during her time in the orphanage there were some incidents.</p><p>Rahne asks what types of incidents and Layla explains that she was a mutant with horns who could breathe fire and the other kids freaked out. She says she’s not a mutant anymore though. Mrs. Charnoff seems unusually pleased by this and says there’ll be no more problems once she’s back.</p><p>Rahne is not so certain as she’s seen firsthand how “embracing” people in Mutant Town have been of former mutants, now that they’re no longer a threat.</p><p>As they turn to leave, Mrs. Charnoff comments on Layla’s butterfly. Layla tells her that it’s dead and that it settled down on her hand and died. She says “bye” to Rahne who watches her go and then picks up the dead butterfly. She eyes it with a mixed expression of concern and curiosity.</p><p>(Layla’s memories)</p><p>Layla remembers her parents as a perfect suburban couple. Her mom talks to her in honeyed words and offers her fresh baked muffins. Her father calls her “butterfly” and they both tell her how glad they are that she’s back and how much they love her.</p><p>(reality)</p><p>The memory is interrupted by Mrs. Charnoff prompting the other orphans to tell Layla how good it is to have her back. The other kids look anything <b>but</b> pleased as they frown and sneer. Layla doesn’t look so happy either but says obligingly that it’s great to be back.</p><p>Back at X-Factor’s offices, a van marked “Castillo Pet Shampoo” is parked outside. Rictor asks what kind of doctor would drive around in such a truck and Madrox tells him “the kind who wants to keep a low profile”. Monet asks if she’s legit and Madrox assures her that she is. Ric asks how they know just as Dr. Castillo walks in. She comments on how great it feels to have your credentials questioned and Madrox tells her that his colleagues are just concerned. She replies that as a doctor it’s her job “not to give a crap”, so it all balances out.</p><p>She compliments Madrox on his stop-gap work on Siryn as she removes her rubber gloves. She tosses them to Monet and asks her to toss them. Monet asks the woman if she looks like a maid and Dr. Castillo replies that given her line of work she looks like a future patient. She snidely says that she’d hate to suture M’s next gaping wound with a blunt needle and again tells her to throw away the gloves. Monet sneers at the woman with her usual “whatever” response.</p><p>Dr. Castillo and Madrox look in on Theresa and the doctor notes that she’s given her something for the pain. She lists off Siryn’s injuries which include minor hairline fractures but no broken bones or internal bleeding. She theorizes that a wooden club or bat was used given the splinters she removed. Madrox notes that Terry was lucky and Dr. Castillo corrects him. She tells him that whoever beat Theresa up knew exactly how to hurt her the most but with minimal permanent damage. She says that this was a warning and if they had wanted Siryn dead, she would be.</p><p>At that moment, Rahne interrupts and tells Jamie they need to talk. He tries to tell her it’s not a good time and she insists and tells him it’s about Layla. Rahne fills Jamie and Guido in on what’s happened with Layla. Despite the mystery surrounding X-Factor’s young hanger-on and the little she has shared with them about herself and her way of knowing things, Jamie can’t help but feel that she somehow belongs there.</p><p>Guido interrupts and says that he thinks it was Singularity who attacked Siryn. Jamie asks why and Guido mentions that Singularity killed Siryn’s informant when she got too close to the truth and that X-Factor just took down their major movie star client. He suspects that the attack on Siryn was payback. Jamie asks if he has any ideas on how to reply to this warning. Guido smiles grimly and says “I surely do”.</p><p>Later that day, Damian Tryp, Jr. is jogging through Central Park. Guido jogs up next to him and tells him to keep running, they’re going to have a little talk. Guido mentions that he enjoyed the write-up about Tryp in the New Yorker and that it was nice of him to share his favorite Sunday afternoon jogging route. Tryp asks what Guido has on his mind. After exchanging faux pleasantries, Guido says that he knows what Tryp or one of his people did and sooner or later, he’s going to make him pay. Tryp stops and asks snidely, “You and what army?” Guido replies “Funny you should ask” and in the next clearing is a sea of Madroxes, upwards of fifty dupes stand in the woods glaringly at Tryp.</p><p>Jamie notes that despite the problems he’s had getting his dupes under control lately, they can all stand together when it comes to defending their own. Especially after the brutal attack on someone they care about like Theresa.</p><p>As Rahne and Jamie drive to St. Joan Orphanage, they discuss the encounter with Tryp. Jamie says they can’t prove anything, but perhaps their warning to Tryp will make him nervous and then he’ll make a mistake that will cost him. Both are convinced that Tryp and Singularity were behind Theresa’s beating.</p><p>They arrive at the orphanage and Rahne notes that the both of them are orphans as well. They guess that Layla’s powers manifested shortly before M-Day and that she may well have ended up at Xavier’s if things hadn’t shifted so dramatically following the Decimation. Rahne guesses that following M-Day she ended up with all the anti-mutant bias and none of the perks of being a mutant and this is why she sought refuge with X-Factor.</p><p>The two meet with Mrs. Charnoff who refuses to let them see Layla. She notes that they have no legal standing for visitation and then makes a somewhat veiled slight against them for being mutants. Rahne reacts by turning into her transitional wolf form and sneers at the woman. She tells Jamie that she has Layla’s scent and they can find her without this woman’s help. As Rahne leads the way, Jamie apologizes to the terrified Mrs. Charnoff and explains that Rahne sometimes gets a little “testy”.</p><p>Rahne tracks Layla with ease and Jamie notes that Wolfsbane can be single-minded and scarily effective when she focuses on getting something done. He’s not sure whether to envy this trait of hers or fear it and decides to do both. He realizes that as a multiple man, he tries to be all things to all people, whereas Rahne just claws her way through life and adversity.</p><p>They find Layla in a playroom and are appalled to see that her face has been beaten and she is sporting a pair of black eyes and several bruises. Rahne asks who did this to her and she replies “No one.” Rahne asks again more insistently and when Layla tries to tell her it’s nothing, Rahne transforms into her wolfoid form and screams out at the other children, demanding to know which of them did this to Layla. They all run away screaming and Jamie snidely compliments her on her interrogation techniques.</p><p>Rahne tries to console Layla who tells her that she deserved it. She explains that she really did know what was going to happen to Siryn and that she may have been able to stop it if she just flapped her wings. Madrox is confused by this and Layla asks if he knows about chaos theory. He says that he does since one of his dupes took a semester of quantum physics. He asks how she knows about it. She says that Jeff Goldblum explained it really well in <i>Jurassic Park</i>.</p><p>Basically, the theory suggests that the flapping of a single butterfly’s wings has the potential to cause a much greater effect as it influences the weather systems around it enough to create a tornado where one may not have arisen without the butterfly’s presence. Layla explains that this is what she does. She senses what is to come in advance and how things might turn out and if things are not going the way they are supposed to, she can alter it by doing some little things that influence the future. She says that she knew Theresa was going to be hurt and she let it happen because she knows that it was supposed to.</p><p>Jamie asks how she knows these things and Layla explains that she can’t tell him, she knows how she knows these things but if she tells him, she will die. She knows that telling this secret will cause her to be “struck down” and asks Jamie not to make her die. Jamie and Rahne look at each other, both stunned by what they have learned.</p><p>Rahne and Madrox meet with Mrs. Charnoff who refuses to allow them to take custody of Layla. She states that she is confident that they would never be approved as foster parents or allowed to adopt her. Rahne asks if she’ll be stuck there until she’s of age and when Mrs. Charnoff says yes, Rahne says they’ll fight it. Mrs. Charnoff coldly tells them that they’ll lose.</p><p>As they are about to leave, Mrs. Charnoff says that she hopes Layla doesn’t escape again and that if she did, even in the company of adults, that she wouldn’t even have the first clue where to look for Layla. She adds that with all the paperwork piling up, she’s not even sure she’d find the time to report it. It might all just slip through the cracks. She looks up at them with an odd but knowing look.</p><p>Later, Layla is sitting on the stoop outside X-Factor’s offices playing with the dead butterfly. Rictor is there with her and asks if she’s staying there now. Layla replies that she is. Rictor asks if she’s having fun playing with the dead butterfly and she says “kinda”. He comments on her black eyes and says that the rumor is some kids did that to her. Layla replies that she heard that, too. Rictor adds that it would have been easy enough for her to do that to herself and maybe she set it up to get sympathy from Rahne and Jamie. Layla simply says that that’s an interesting thought. As he leaves, Rictor says “I’ll be watching you, Butterfly.” And Layla says “okay.” She smiles softly as the once-dead butterfly on her finger takes flight.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Two Meetings, One in Person, One Not.” Think it’s tough to convince fans that one of Marvel’s mighty mutants was genuinely killed in action and never returning? Try convincing one of X-Factor’s members, lost in denial over the death of a loved one. Meanwhile, Jamie Madrox has his first face-to-face confrontation with Mr. Tryp, the mysterious head of Singlarity Investigations...and let’s just say it doesn’t go very well for Madrox.</i></p><p><u>Issue Summary:</u></p><p>Jamie Madrox is propelled through the window of Damian Tryp’s high-rise office building, dozens of stories above the street below. He – along with his dupe, created by the impact of the window – begin the long fall to certain death.</p><p>(earlier that morning)</p><p>In their office of X-Factor Investigations, Rahne calls out to Jamie, just arriving at the office, informing him that he just received a letter by courier from Singularity Investigations. When he asks what they want, she replies that “he” wants to meet with him. Further asked “he who,” Rahne tells him that it’s Damian Tryp, senior. The head of the company.</p><p>As he tries to place his coat on the hanger, failing to make the toss, Jamie wonders why Tryp wants to see him. Maybe he’s a fan of his work, Rahne suggests. Incredulous at this, Jamie reminds her that they got one of his clients thrown in jail for manslaughter and one of his operatives blew her brains out rather than having them catch her. A fan? Not likely.</p><p>After finally successfully placing his coat on the rack, Jamie asks to see the letter. He notes that it is at 3 PM that day and wonders aloud what’s the worst that can happen. To this, Rahne suggests that Tryp kills him. He should send a duplicate. It’s too easy not to. All he has to do is hit something and… <i>presto</i> - instant duplicate. Dismissing this, Jamie rejoins that he’s not afraid to face him. When Rahne quickly declares that he’s being an idiot, Jamie replies that he’s not afraid to be that, either.</p><p>Jamie and Rahne’s conversation is suddenly interrupted by a new arrival, who promptly greets the two. Looking up from the letter, Jamie greets the new arrival in turn, asking what brings them there. The new arrival informs them that they need to see Siryn… Theresa. They heard she’d been injured. Jamie replies that she’s well on the mend. In <i>great</i> spirits.</p><p>Upstairs, Theresa announces to the Lord almighty that she needs a drink. Holding a tray, Layla replies to Theresa that she’s in luck. She brought up a root beer with her lunch. Irritated, Theresa asks where they get off, calling soda pop “beer?” That’s just … un-American. She needs a real drink. Just one, swear to God. Just to ease the pain. Still trying to be helpful, Layla suggests that she could get her some more aspirin. However, Theresa replies that it’s not <i>that</i> pain. She was beaten half to death. She was held bound and gagged. Does she have any idea… any… how <i>humiliating</i> that was? How…</p><p>Interrupting as she places the lunch tray on a table, Layla asks Theresa if she wants her to bring her a drink. She’s an alcoholic. Why not just ask her to shoot her in the heart? It’s the same thing… Angered, Theresa points her cane at Layla, telling her not to dare lecture her. When Layla begins to defend that she wasn’t, Theresa replies that she was, the little sanctimonious…</p><p>A voice interrupts the escalation of Theresa’s rant, apologizing if this is a bad time. Turning to the new arrival, Theresa greets Scott Summers of the X-Men, calling him a stranger. Saying a proper hello to her, Scott informs her that he needs to speak to her about something, if it’s not too much trouble… In private, right, Layla says. Not waiting for a reply, she states that it’s okay. She’ll make herself scarce. Before leaving, however, Layla takes a moment to tell Theresa that she’s sorry. Sitting in a chair, Theresa apologizes back, saying that she was out of line just then…. Interrupting her, Layla places her hand on Theresa’s, rejoining that it’s not about that. She’ll understand later.</p><p>As Layla leaves, Scott asks what she’s doing there. When Theresa then asks back if he knows her, Scott begins to reply yes, but then thinks better of it. Instead, he states that he was just… surprised that some young girl is hanging around there… Who, uh… he stammers. Who <i>is</i> she? Cocking her head back, Theresa replies that she’s Layla Miller. She “knows stuff.” If Nostradamus was reborn as Wednesday Addams, that’s be her.</p><p>Changing subjects, Theresa asks if she can guess. Scott heard what happened to her and got all worried and wanted the details. Stumbling over his answer, Scott replies that he was worried, but that’s not… Regaining his composure, Scott tells Theresa that, as leader of the X-Men, there’re some things that fall to him, and they’re not easy to…</p><p>Sitting forward, Theresa asks Scott what’s going on. He explains that there was a plane… a plane full of innocent people and… Crazed at the slow pace of information, Theresa asks Scott to please just tell her what’s… Banshee was killed in action, he tells her bluntly. He’s sorry.</p><p>Explaining further, he tells her that a madman had taken over their jet, the Blackbird, and was flying it toward a planeload of innocent people. Sean took a run at stopping the Blackbird, but his sonic scream hasn’t been the same since Mystique slit his throat. Anyway, he blew straight at the Blackbird, and his sound assault didn’t slow it, and… The Blackbird hit him straight on. It was incredibly brave, Scott says, and he was honored to have fought at his side. All the X-Men were, and X-Corporation…</p><p>Trailing, Scott’s words end and he stands in silence as Theresa takes in his news. When she does not reply after a few moments, he says her name inquisitively. He then tells her that there’s going to be a reading of the will but he has some personal effects that he’s got there for her… Shaken out of her trance, Theresa asks about the reading of his will. When Scott confirms, Theresa asks why. It’s not like he’s <i>really</i> dead. To this, Scott Summers is speechless.</p><p>Later, at Singularity Investigations, Damian Tryp, senior, welcomes Jamie Madrox with open arms into his spacious office. Shaking Jamie’s hand, Tryp thanks him for coming. Well, he asked him, Jamie replies. So…</p><p>Returning to behind his desk, Tryp senior gestures to another present, telling Jamie that he believes he’s <i>already</i> made the acquaintance of Damian junior. Replying with an “Ohhh <i>right</i>,” Jamie recalls him from the park the other day. Shaking Jamie’s hand, Damian junior recalls it as well. It’s hard to forget forty of the same man standing there with bats, looking threatening. Well, you know what they say, Jamie replies. You never get a <i>second</i> chance to make a good <i>first</i> impression. Clearly not amused, Damian junior asks if he calls trying to scare him a “good first impression.” His own face the height of calm and dispassionate, Jamie replies that he guesses it depends on one’s definition of “good.” Indeed, Damian junior rejoins.</p><p>Walking to the stand, upon which rests a small statue of Romulus and Remus as infants, suckling the she-wolf that raised them, Jamie tells the two that he loves what they’ve done with the place. It oozes confidence and gravitas, with just a dollop of testosterone. And age. Like they’ve been in business for centuries. How long have they been around? Quite some time, Damian senior replies. It’s a family business.</p><p>When Damian senior directs him to have a seat, Jamie complies, leaning back with his hands behind his head. He suggests that Damian junior sit as well. These are <i>really</i> comfortable chairs. When junior replies that he knows, as he picked them out, Jamie rejoins with a “good on you, then.”</p><p>Wishing to get to the subject, Jamie tells Damian senior that, while he could just stay there, luxuriating in rich Corinthian leather and trading dazzling self-conscious repartee the whole day, he suspects that they both have other things to do. Agreeing, Damian senior informs Jamie that they want to invite him to join the Singularity Investigations family. When Jamie does not seem to immediately understand, Damian senior explains that they– how to put this… They want to sign him to an exclusive contract. Jamie takes a moment to take this in, before exploding in uncontrollable laughter.</p><p>Angry at such impertinence, Damian junior reminds his father that he told him that this was a waste of time. Still smiling, Damian senior replies that Mr. Madrox hasn’t heard the details… Wiping the tears from his eyes, Jamie agrees, asking, by all means, for him to hit him with the details. Is he talking all of X-Factor or just him? How about medical? Dental? Is there a signing bonus?</p><p>Growing serious, Damian senior replies that it is for all of them. They would investigate the cases they provide them, plus be put on a regular – and very generous – stipend. A guaranteed minimum. A “pay or play” deal, as it were. Yes, they provide medical and dental. A signing bonus is open to discussion.</p><p>Taken aback, Jamie tells Damian that he’s got to dig up a sense of humor. He wasn’t serious. Undeterred, Tryp senior then informs Madrox that they’ll buy him outright. Fifty million dollars for the whole operation, soup to nuts. To this, Jamie Madrox can offer only stunned silence.</p><p>In the common room of X-Factor Investigations, Guido finds Rahne, Rictor and Monet lounging in a melancholic mood. When he asks them why all the long faces, Rahne replies that they have bad news… Sean Cassidy is dead. Shocked at this, Guido replies that that’s too bad. He remembers him from “the Hardy Boys.” When Rahne is taken aback by this, Guido replies that he stared in the show with, what’s his name, Kirstie Alley’s ex. And he did a nice cover of “Da Doo Ron Ron…”</p><p>Rising to her feet, Monet rejoins that it’s not Shaun Cassidy, the actor. S-E-A-N Cassidy, the Banshee. Embarrassed by his error, Guido swears, saying that he feels like an idiot. Sitting back down, Monet suggests that he go with that feeling. Rictor tries to defend Guido, asking Monet to cut him some slack, but Monet replies with a sarcastic, <i>whatever</i>.</p><p>Ignoring the two, Guido asks Rahne what happened. She explains that Scott came by. He said Banshee died in combat, saving a planeload of people. Well, that’s how he’d have <i>wanted</i> to go out, Guido replies. He then asks how’s “Sy” been taking it. He bets she’s a wreck. Interrupting their conversation, Theresa sticks her head in. She informs the two that she was thinking they bring in Chinese for dinner tonight and asks who’s in. Seeing only silent faces, with jaws dropped, she assumes that his means Chinese’s no good.</p><p>Finally speaking up, Guido tells Theresa that he heard about her dad, and he’s… Dismissing it, Theresa asks him to give her a break. Half the X-teams are always mourning the other half, thinking them dead. If he’s thinking he’s dead, if he thinks she’s falling for it, he can just forget it. Her “da” is fine. He’ll turn up. Returning to the subject of dinner, she announces she’s finding the menu. They should leave their orders on the kitchen table. She’ll phone it in. With this, Theresa turns and leaves, leaving behind a dumbstruck group. Speaking first, Monet proclaims that “denial” really <i>isn’t</i> just a river in Egypt.</p><p>Leaning across Damian Tryp senior’s desk, Jamie Madrox tells his hosts that there’s no denying he’s impressed… Interrupting, Damian senior replies that they felt it only respectful to make him a serious offer. Oh, not the offer, Madrox corrects, placing his fist on the desk. It’s that they must be getting close to something in their investigation. Something big. Something they don’t want X-Factor to find out. Placing his own fist on his desk, Damian senior asks through gritted teeth what might that be? The Decimation, obviously, Madrox rejoins. He’s thinking he had something t do with it. “Oh, really?” Damian spits back. And how does he come to <i>that</i> conclusion? They’ve been spending the past weeks rousting the usual suspects. People who have a grudge against mutants. Bad guys who’d like to see them dead. No one admits to knowing anything. Now… they could all be lying… or maybe someone who hasn’t been on their radar until recently is involved. Someone like them, Damian replies. Yup, Madrox rejoins.</p><p>Sitting back, Tryp smiles. He tells Jamie that he’s beginning to think their offer was too high, if that’s the limit of their investigative thinking. “The Usual Suspects” will suffice if they’re Claude Rains… or even Kevin Spacey. Why hasn’t he considered going in the <i>opposite</i> direction? What, Madrox asks. Does he mean their friends? Their allies? They went to them first thing. None of them knows anything about it. So they say, Damian junior chimes in. Yeah, Madrox agrees with a quirk of the mouth. So they say.</p><p>Continuing, Madrox adds that <i>he</i> says that he still thinks they’re the ones who beat up Siryn. So he wouldn’t sneak up behind him if he were him. He’s <i>hate</i> to overreact. Now leaning over Madrox’s chair, Damian junior asks if he thinks their friends would have no reason to lie to him? Turning away, Jamie defiantly replies, “none.” <i>Everyone</i> lies, Mr. Madrox, Damian senior tells him. To each other. To themselves. Everyone.</p><p>“He’s not dead,” Theresa tells herself as she its on the edge of her bed, examining the box that Scott brought. Da’s not dead. Why don’t they get that? Is she the <i>only</i> sane one there?</p><p>Okay, okay, she tells herself, as she removes the brown paper wrapping of the box. Fine. She’ll play along, okay? Opening the box, she finds a DVD marked “to Theresa” and something wrapped in bubble wrap. Great, she says. Fine. Placing the DVD disc into the player, Theresa remarks that she knows what this is. It’s “Brigadoon.” He’s always swearing he’ll find a way to make her watch that damned movie, so… Theresa’s words trail as she hears the voice of her father from the television. “Hello, Terry,” he says. Stunned for a moment, Theresa eventually says hello to her father.</p><p>On the screen, Sean Cassidy stands before a stone keep, waving to the camera – and Theresa though it. <i>If you’re seeing this</i>, he begins, <i>then I’m afraid ye won’t be seeing me anymore. For that, I’m truly sorry. I’m hopin’ I went out in a blaze of glory, instead of… I dunno… getting meself drunk, falling off a barstool and breaking me fool neck. Either way… don’t waste too many tears. I had a good run, and catered to me better angels more than he devils… so here’s hoping Saint Peter will smile upon me.</i></p><p>I hear you’ve been introducing yourself as “Theresa Cassidy” lately, rather than Rourke. Hopefully, Maeve Rourke, your dear departed mother, won’t complain about it to her when I see her. I’m thinkin’ not. I’d like to think she would be pleased you’re trying to embrace your heritage. Lord knows I was flattered… and very, very proud. I don’t think I’ve ever told you enough <i>how proud of you I am.</i></p><p><i>Anyway</i>, Sean continues, pointing to the stone keep behind him, <i>Cassidy Keep will be yours, of course. Treat it well. Still… a castle is just cold stone, and money is heartless. So I wan you to be leaving you something… more.</i> With this, a horse moves into the camera’s view. <i>No, it’s not this horse</i>, Sean tells her. <i>That’s just for me dramatic exit. It’s something that me father passed on to me, and his father to him, and so on. And I’m bequeathing it to you. Scott will make sure that it accompanies this message. It’s just me way of showing that you’re me heir in every respect... and just how much I love you… something else I haven’t said nearly enough.</i> As her father speaks, Theresa glances down at the cylinder from the box, previously wrapped in bubble wrap.</p><p>Back on the screen, Sean has climbed onto the horse for his dramatic exit. <i>Hopefully, between now and the time you see this, I’ll have plenty more opportunities. Sadly… One never knows. And now,</i> he says, preparing the horse for riding, <i>it’s time to ride off into the sunset. Slán agat, me love</i>. With this, Sean rides off into the sunset and his dramatic exit.</p><p>Goodbye, Mr. Madrox, Damian senior announces to his guest. Asked by him if they’re done, he senior replies that he’s afraid so. He’s sorry they couldn’t do business. Well, Jamies replies, that being the case, let me say one final thing… Standing to his feet, Madrox points his finger accusatorially and announces, “You’re going down.” Pointing his own finger back in kind, Damian senior replies, “You first.” Picked up by an unseen force, Madrox is lifted off of his feet. Asking if he’s afraid yet, Damian senior throws Madrox towards the window, informing him that he really should have sent a dupe.</p><p>Jamie Madrox is propelled through the window of Damian Tryp’s high-rise office building, dozens of stories above the street below. He – along with his dupe, created by the impact of the window – begin the long fall to certain death. However, long before they reach the street, they begin to decorporialize and are reabsorbed by the original Madrox, standing on the roof of a nearby building. Watching this, Damian junior remarks in disgust that <i>that</i> figures.</p><p>Reabsorbing the duplicates, Madrox is glad that Rahne talked him out of being an idiot. With both dupes sucked back into him with what he needed to know… maybe Tryp will be a little fearful of <i>him</i></p><p>Back in his office, Damian Tryp senior remarks that at least they see each other <i>plainly</i>.</p><p>Calling back to base on his mobile phone, Jamie reaches Layla and instructs her to have the office swept for electronic bugs. Yes, he <i>knows</i> they did it two days ago, but she should do it again. Singularity Investigation’s listening in on them. She needs to call him back when she’s found them. And, he continues, eying the two rings he is wearing, Jamie notes that, when he gets back, they’ll have these DNA samples he took off Messrs. Tryp and Tryp analyzed… so they know exactly what they’re dealing with.</p><p>Eying Madrox from across the street from the hole in their office window, Damian junior tells his father that he didn’t need to tip his hand that way… literally. It was going to happen sooner or later, Damian senior replies. May as well be sooner. Realizing this was intentional, Damian junior asks his father if he <i>knew</i> if was dealing with a dupe. Of course, he knew, senior rejoins. As he said, everyone lies… To each other. To themselves. Certainly if they have reason to suspect listening devices are present. But let him think he was willing to kill him. That knowledge will eat away at him, make him nervous. And if it doesn’t junior asks. Well, then, senior remarks, they see how he reacts when he finds out he was <i>responsible</i> for the death of his parents. Let him stick <i>that</i> in his pipe and smoke it.</p><p>Smoke wafts past the now open and empty canister from Theresa’s father. Its contents, now in a pipe held by Theresa, are alit and smoldering. Sitting in her chair, enjoying the smoke, Theresa is silent in contemplation. Considering the pipe, he remarks that he’ll be back. He’s not fooling her. Nope. Not for a minute. “Nice try, da.”</p>",

The divisiveness of CIVIL WAR has spread to his own team, as half of them want to cooperate with the government, while the other half wants to take a stand against it. It’s Jamie’s decision that may well decide whether X-Factor stands or cracks apart...and things aren’t being helped by Quicksilver, who offers Rictor the opportunity to get his powers back -- but at what price?</p><p>Guest starring QUICKSILVER!</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Overview:</i></p><p>They have been a thorn in X-Factor’s side since the beginning, and now matters are coming to a head. In the first of a three part epic—“Multiple Disclosure”—X-Factor’s newest assignment causes them to once again cross paths with their arch rivals, Singularity Investigations. The result is revelations that strike to the very core of who and what Jamie Madrox is, especially when he learns that SI head Damian Tryp is responsible for one of the greatest tragedies.</p><p><b>Issue Summary:</b></p><p>(South of Wales, 1347)</p><p>In a small village, surrounded by woods, cries ring out. A number of the village’s populace has gathered outside a house, bearing pitchforks and torches. The voices call for “him” to be brought out. <i>Bring the creature out!</i> Leading the rest of the mob, one man calls Andreas, within the house. He heard them! He instructs him to get his demon son out… or they’ll burn him out. Both of them!</p><p>Opening the door, Andreas asks the mob leader what he would have of him. They’d have that… thing… pretending to be human. “Aye,” another agrees. He’s the cause of all of this! Of all what? Andreas asks. Of his poor mother’s death in childbirth? Of the plague sweeping the whole of Wales? Of his lies and accusations of madness? Why not lay original sin at his feet while they’re at it. Showing his son, who stands by his side, Andreas asks them to look for <i>themselves</i>… terrifying a young boy out of his mind. He’s sure they’re ever so proud.</p><p>Undeterred, one of the mob replies that whatever killed his wife in childbirth years ago… it wasn’t that <i>thing</i>. It’s a changeling, another exclaims. He knows it! They all know it! And <i>how</i> is he supposed to know <i>that</i>? Andreas asks. “His strength!” the man yes. “The way the very <i>air</i> protects him!” When Andreas protests, the man continues, pointing out the child’s knowledge. Far wiser than any child has a right to be. A <i>sure</i> sign of a changeling. When the incredulous Andreas asks if he would condemn the boy because he’s intelligent, the man replies that they condemn him because they’re dying, thanks to an illness spat up by Satan, and he’s Satan’s spawn!</p><p>Explaining further, the man tells Andreas that they already killed all the <i>cats</i>, those evil creatures, and <i>still</i> the disease spreads. So, another chimes in, they have to look elsewhere. Retreating back into his house, Andreas orders them to look elsewhere. He’ll not sacrifice his son to their rantings! With this, he slams the door. Now safe inside, the boy clings to his father’s leg, asking him if he’s going to send him out there. Replying that he won’t, Andreas tells his son, Dai, that they’re just scared fools. Given time, they’ll come o their senses. He promises that…</p><p>Their conversation is interrupted as the ceiling suddenly catches fire. Outside, the mob has begun to throw torches onto the roof, setting it ablaze. Inside, “Dai” raises his arm toward the blazing ceiling, telling his father not to worry. He’ll make it stop! They want winds? He’ll give them winds! That’ll blow it out! Andreas tries to warn his son not to do anything, as he’ll only fan the flames – or spread them… to the rest of the village. Unfortunately, Andreas is too late, and the flames spread as predicted.</p><p>A moment later, Dai finds himself on a nearby cliff, high above the blazing village below. Startled at his sudden relocation, he wonders how it happened. Then noticing the flaming village, he wonders what he has done. “What you had to do,” a voice tells him. Turning around, Dai behold a man wearing strange clothes. Had he any knowledge of men’s clothing centuries hence, Dai would know the garments worn by Damian Tryp senior was called a business suit.</p><p>Exasperated at the sight before him, Dai asks the strange what he is. His face cold and hard, Damian Tryp senior replies that Dai will understand… eventually. He knows that he did. A moment later, birds fly by, fluttering through Tryp. Seeing this, Dai asks him if he’s a ghost. When the stranger replies “not exactly,” Dai then asks if he is dead. From the fire. When Tryp asks to what fire he is referring, Dai turns around, pointing to the village and asking if he’s daft. However, he is amazed at the scene of the village before him. No longer ablaze, the village is actually whole and untouched. Another glance brings yet another surprise, as he sees the mob from earlier, once again gathered before his father’s house, demanding that he turn over Dai.</p><p>Now convinced that he is losing his mind, Dai declares that he <i>is</i> dead. He’s dead and going crazy. This is the end… No, Tryp senior interrupts. As cliché as this will sound, he tells him – this is just the beginning.</p><p>(present)</p><p>Damian Tryp senior is lost in thought, staring out of the window to this office. His attention is returned to reality by the voice of his assistant, Ms. D, who tells him that he’s getting an early start today. She supposes the early bird catches the worm. True enough, he replies. Although, at the end of the morning, you’re just left with a worm in your mouth. Still, he continues, a day is a day. Lives can begin, end and change in a day. So each must be treated as precious.</p><p>Returning to the business at hand, he asks what’s on the docket. Looking over her folder, she informs him that he has a light morning, but the afternoon is packed. Oh, and personnel rang up. Professor Buchanan called in sick. Smiling at this, she then adds that, all these years, Henry’s never missed a day before. Sort of the iron man of Singularity Investigations. Stroking his chin in thought, Tryp senior replies that even iron men have chink in their armor. He then asks her to get <i>Mr. C’s</i> number. He may have a call to make.</p><p>(Bloomfield, NJ)</p><p>In their house, Professor Henry Buchanan’s wife tries to console him. She tells him that this is insane. It’s eating him up. Agitated, he asks her if she thinks he doesn’t <i>see</i> it. Does she think he doesn’t… Calming down a little, he tells his wife, Alix, that he needs to think.</p><p>Not giving up, she tells him to talk to her. Tell her what’s going on. Is this about work? It <i>has</i> to be. Look, she tells him, it it’s just too much for him... they have money set aside. He can just quit and… Interrupting, he looks back at her with cold eyes. “Quit?” He chuckles at this idea. That’s right, he then says. Quit and find something else to… Standing up abruptly, he tells Alix that there’s no “quit” – doesn’t she get that? There’s no out! N resignation! <i>No! Quit!</i> They’ll… Interrupting, Alix asks what they will do. Frowning ever so slightly, he replies, “Disapprove.”</p><p>Thinking that her husband is being glib, Alix pleads with him. She’s his wife; he can trust her. Sitting back down, Henry replies that it’s not about trust. If he tells her what’s going on, he’s <i>endangering</i> her, and he won’t do that. Finally beginning to grasp the importance, Alix is more concerned than ever. If it’s that bad, she tells him, he has to go to someone. The police… The police are useless for something like this, he explains. The government then, she suggests. She has no idea of Singularity’s reach, he replies. They have people inside the government.</p><p>Well, Alix continues, not giving up, there must be someone he can go to. Some independent organization, some… Eying something on the front page of the paper, Henry’s eyes go wide. He interrupts his wife, telling her that he wants her to get out of town. Pack and go to her sister’s cabin in Seattle. She’s to drive there, pay cash for everything. Exasperated at the idea, Alix asks what about him. His eyes still glued to the paper’s front page, he tells her no to worry about him. Eying the front page of the Daily Bugle, with Jamie Madrox standing before a podium, he reads the headline: <i>X-Factor to Gov’t: DROP DEAD</i>. The caption below the photo reads, “Unpatriotic mutant team protests registration act.” “I think I’ve found help,” Henry tells his wife.</p><p>Jamie Madrox awakes in his bed with a great yawn. He half expected to wake up in prison, he thinks to himself. At the very least, he thought SHIELD would be kicking in their door… not just for their “up yours” press conference, but because he helped Aegis escape he other day. They <i>gotta</i> know it was him. Instead, nothing. Maybe they caught Aegis anyway and just decided to let him slide. After all, they already got their info for the registration act. Or maybe they’re watching to see if they’re part of an underground and nab more fugitives that way. The other shoe could drop on them at any time.</p><p>Rising out of bed, Jamie thinks that, if it does, he hopes it drops quietly. Stupid freaking headache. Geez… how much did he have to drink last night? Placing his robe on, he heads out the door to the hall bathroom. Well, he guesses he was entitled, he reflects. If you can’t get hammered burning every freaking bridge behind you, when can you?</p><p>As he walks, fastening his bathrobe, he thinks that it’s starting to come back to him. Bits a pieces. Weird. The whole team seemed so proud of him. Even the ones who disagreed with his decision. They said they respected him for making it. Said they thought it was gutsy that he stood up to Cyclops. “Gutsy,” he repeats in his head. How is it gutsy when your stomach is tied in knots?</p><p>Seeing that the bathroom is occupied, Jamie knocks on it, asking the occupant if they’re going to be in there long. Opening the door, the occupant replies that it’s all his. To Jamie’s surprise, the occupant is a duplicate. When he asks the dupe who he is, the incredulous dupe replies, “You, of course, you devilishly handsome fellow.” Replying that he knows, Jamie begins to stutter. How is he…? He means… when did he…? Replying simply, the dupe tells him that he bumped into a wall. Presto: him.</p><p>Now noticing the dupe’s pajamas and robe, Jamie asks about them. However, the dupe mischievously replies that he has his ways – then adding that they have an image to maintain. Can’t have the ladies seeing him so disheveled. Ruffling Jamie’s hair a little, the dupe tells him that that’s better. And now… Seeing the dupe begin to leave, Jamie asks if he has an appointment. Grinning wryly, the dupe rejoins that it’s more of a return engagement and walks to a bedroom door. Having had enough, Jamie tells the dupe that he’s right about that, and holds his hand out, reabsorbing his “Hef” dupe and “returning” him to his self. A moment later, Jamie has also absorbed the dupe’s memories of the previous night, much to his bewilderment.</p><p>Suddenly, Theresa emerges from the open door, wrapped in a robe and a smile. As memories race through his mind, Jamie stands in shock as Theresa gives him a seductive “Hello, there,” followed by a passionate kiss. Caught up in the moment, Jamie Madrox is more than happy to reciprocate.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, Theresa tells the dumbfounded Jamie that he… <i>was</i>… <i>fantastic</i> last night. “You too,” he replies, quietly. Moving to the now-unoccupied bathroom, she tells him that she guesses their previous relationship was just a warm-up, huh? “Guess so,” he replies sheepishly.</p><p>Still reeling from this, Jamie hears his name called from across the hall. Turning around, he sees Monet, standing in the doorway to her bedroom, wearing a long nightshirt. Without saying a word, she walks up to him, wrapping her arms around his neck and kissing him deeply, lifting her leg so that her foot caresses his leg. Caught up in the moment, Jamie Madrox is more than happy to reciprocate.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, Monet continues to hold her hand around his neck. Her eyes stare deeply into his. “Last night,” she tells him. Uh, uh, he rejoins. Leaning forward, Monet whispers into Jamie’s ears that now she knows why they call him “Multiple Man.” She will see him later. <i>Count</i> on it, she emphasizes.</p><p>Moving to the bathroom her self, Monet knocks on the door, telling whoever is in there that they had better now be taking a shower. Calling back from within, Theresa tells Monet to hold her water. Still thunderstruck at the last few moments, Jamie tries his best to make good his escape.</p><p>Moments later, he reaches the top of the stairs, but pauses before descending. Waiting for him at the bottom is the young Layla Miller. To Jamie’s nervous and apprehensive eyes, she seems to be waiting for him expectedly. As he cautiously descends, she declares him to be a dead man walking, then informing him that the downstairs bathroom is free. Still uneasy, Jamie continues to walk down, trying not to look at Layla, who regards him curiously. Jamie finally stops when his curiosity gets the best of him.</p><p>Turning back up, he asks Layla if… <i>she</i> and he… Grinning innocently, she tells him of course, not. When he quickly thanks God, she then adds that she’s saving herself for their wedding night. Jamie Madrox is beyond speechless.</p><p>Whistling to himself, Guido Carosella strolls down the sidewalk of Mutant Town, listening to a walkman. Rounding a corner, he is bumped into – most violently for the other man – by Professor Henry Buchanan, who is knocked off his feet. Still on his knees, Professor Buchanan quickly informs Guido that they want to <i>kill</i> him. Taken aback for a moment, Guido then asks <i>who</i> is. “They do!” the professor exclaims, pointing to a car, which has stopped abruptly before them. Oh, yeah, Guido snidely quips, he’d like to see them try. When he then sees a rocket launcher emerging from the window’s backseat, he then remarks that he didn’t wanna see them try <i>that</i> much.</p><p>Moving quickly, Guido positions himself between the professor and the car. A moment later, the rocket fires and the world erupts into flames behind Guido, in an explosive <i>BA-THROOM</i>.</p><p>The explosion is heard from within the kitchen of X-Factor Investigations by Rahne and Jamie. When Rahne rhetorically asks what the hell that was, Jamie informs her that it was an explosion. “Oh, you think?!” she yells back. Racing to the front door, they are joined by Theresa in her Siryn costume, who asks them if they heard that. Still incredulous, Rahne asks if she’s kidding. They heard it in <i>Brooklyn!</i> Reaching the bottom of the front steps, Jamie beholds the visage of the still-intact and alive Guido, though his clothes and skin are charred and covered in ash. Beside him is the relatively unscathed Professor Henry Buchanan.</p><p>Panicked, Jamie asks Guido if he’s okay and what happened, though Guido promptly responds with a “what?” When Jamie repeats his question, Guido apologizes, saying that he can’t hear him, as he’s got a ringing in his ears on account’o somebody fired a frickin’ <i>rocket launcher</i> at him from, like, <i>ten feet away</i>!</p><p>A short while later, as Guido is getting himself cleaned up, the rest of X-Factor tries to calm down Professor Buchanan, who – <i>interestingly</i> enough – works for Singularity. Bringing the professor a cup and saucer, Layla tells him “decaf, no cream, no sugar.” When the professor asks how she knew, Siryn sarcastically informs him that Layla knows stuff. Though agreeing with Theresa, Layla tells her that, in this case, she was just saying they only <i>have</i> decaf, and they’re also out of cream and sugar. She’ll do a grocery run later, she then adds.</p><p>Annoyed once again at the young girl, Siryn asks Layla if she knew that Guido was going to get himself shot up by a bazooka. Actually, no, Layla replies. It’s kind of strange. She almost <i>never</i> knows anything about him. Weird, huh? Not as weird as <i>she</i> is, Siryn rejoins, with a crooked smile. That’s true, Layla replies, thoughtfully.</p><p>Finished cleaning up, Guido joins the rest of the group, asking what’s up with the “prof.” In response, Jamie tells Guido that they were hoping he would tell them. Sensing it’s time to explain, Professor Buchanan tells the group that here’s the thing: He’s a micro-biologist. Mostly, his work for S.I. has been forensic, but for the past year they’ve had him working on… a virus. Narrowing his eyes, Jamie asks what <i>kind</i> of virus. One that would target and kill mutants, the professor replies.</p><p>Hearing this, Jamie’s voice lowers. In disbelief, he says, “the Legacy virus?” When the professor doesn’t seem to understand, Jamie’s voice raises to a shout, as he grabs the professor by the collar, yanking him up out of his chair. “You’re re-creating the Legacy virus?!? What kind of inhuman slime are you?!?” As Guido and Theresa try to calm him, Jamie refuses. He tells <i>her</i> to take it easy. <i>She</i> didn’t <i>die</i> from it. She…</p><p>Shocked back to his own senses, Jamie calms himself down. Closing his eyes, he reminds himself that the man’s not inhuman. He came to them for help. He obviously wants to stop it. Get it together, Madrox, he tells himself. Succeeding in doing so, Jamie apologizes. It’s just… they’ve faced a nightmare like this before, and it’s very… Emotional? Guido asks. Yeah, Jamie replies. It’s an emotional issue. He then asks the professor to accept his apology. Continuing to straighten his coat jacket, Professor Buchanan hesitantly does so.</p><p>Retuning to the subject, Rahne asks the professor if he has any proof of what he’s saying. Proof that would tie Singularity directly to this. Replying that he does, the professor tells them he has memos. Notes. CD-ROMS. Things he smuggled out of the office… while he worked up the nerve to do something about it. They’re in a safe deposit box at the Manhattan Bank, over on 34th and 6th. Turning to Guido, Jamie asks if he would mind escorting the professor to the bank and retrieving his files. He can take his car. Replying with a quick “You got it,” Guido places his arm around the professor and takes him to the car.</p><p>As they depart, Madrox considers that this may be it. The opening they need to bring S.I. crashing down... and it just walked right into their laps. Provided he doesn’t scare him off.</p><p>In his office at the medical center, Pietro Maximoff welcomes Rictor. He informs him that he had a <i>feeling</i> he’d show up sooner or later. But he didn’t expect it to be <i>this</i> much sooner. When Pietro offers him a seat, Rictor refuses, telling him that he won’t be staying. He’s… he’s not even sure why he came. Leaning forward on his desk, stroking his chin, Pietro replies that he assumed it was because he wanted him to restore his lost mutant powers. That he wanted the earth to <i>tremble</i> before his mere gesture once more.</p><p>The thing is, Rictor explains, the way he hears it, when Pietro restores powers, it doesn’t go exactly... <i>right</i>. He doesn’t know what’ll go wrong with him if he gives them back. His process is screwed up.</p><p>The “process,” Pietro responds, isn’t screwed up. It’s people. He clearly doesn’t understand what’s happening. And he’s going to explain it? Rictor asks, incredulous. If he’d like, Pietro replies. <i>This</i> oughtta be good, Rictor retorts.</p><p>Standing, Quicksilver tells Rictor that he’s acquired this ability… for a <i>higher purpose</i>. Something greater than he has brought him to this place… to this task. Once there were far <i>fewer</i> mutants. They were great, powerful beings, with power and presence. Whether you agreed or disagreed with their intent, there was no denying their inherent greatness. But, he continues, in recent years, their number has swelled beyond control. Quantity has offset quality, diluting the nobility of their species. What he is seeing now – “M-Day,” the Decimation – it’s part of a divine test. And his role is to help administer it.</p><p>When Rictor then asks a test of what, Quicksilver replies “worth.” Those who are deserving of getting their powers back become whole… will receive them that way. Those whose powers are warped and twisted, well… that’s just a reflection of their own dark and undeserving nature. So, he continues, the question Rictor must ask himself is not “what will go wrong?” – it should be… “Will I be judged deserving,” Rictor finishes. Pointing his finger at Rictor, Pietro says, “You tell me.” In silent contemplation, Rictor ponders the question.</p><p>Riding in the passenger seat of Madrox’s Hummer, Professor Buchanan vocally realizes that he hasn’t actually thanked Guido for saving his life. However, not knowing Guido’s name, he trips over it. Introducing himself, Guido tells the professor that he’s Guido. Guido Carosella. <i>Strong Guy</i>, for what that’s worth.</p><p>When Guido then asks him if he’s comfortable, the professor replies that he is – as comfortable as he can be in a Hummer. Recalling the earlier altercation, he then asks Guido if his Mr. Madrox is always that… high-strung. It’s understandable, Guido replies, if you consider that he died from a virus kind of like what he’s talking about. Taken aback at this statement, Professor Buchanan repeats the word “died” and then adds that he doesn’t understand. Replying that he doesn’t blame him, Guido excuses himself from the conversation, as his phone is ringing.</p><p>Picking it up, Guido begins a one-sided, abrupt conversation. “Yeah? Uh-huh. Okay. I’m on it.” Speaking up, the professor interrupts, informing Guido that he shouldn’t be talking on the phone while driving. There’s a law against it. He doesn’t want to be pulled over. Seeming to ignore the professor, Guido tells his Buchanan that there’s a change in plans.</p><p>Without another word, Guido violently rams the phone into the professor’s trachea, causing it to emit a sickening crunch. As he bites his lip in increasing anger, Guido hits the professor again with his phone, this time impacting his upper chest. Dripping blood, Professor Henry Buchanan slumps into his seat, very much dead.</p><p>Replacing the phone back to his ear, Guido tells the party on the other end that “that’s done.” He then adds that he’s gotta hang up. There’s laws against talking on a cell phone. He wouldn’t wanna be pulled over. On the other end, Damian Tryp senior tells “Mr. C” that he’s quite correct. They wouldn’t want that.</p><p>Giving further orders, he tells Guido to bring the corpse to the rendezvous point. Now calling out to Mrs. D, Tryp senior instructs her to inform personnel that Henry Buchanan won’t be back. It appears he has moved on.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Overview:</i></p><p>With Singularity Investigations’ plan revealed, X-Factor faces danger from a completely unexpected source as they race against time to save the lives of every non-mutant on the planet.</p><p><b>Issue Summary:</b></p><p>(years ago)</p><p>In a rural farmhouse in the country, the owners receive a visitor. Dressed in an impeccable suit, which contrasts against the simple clothes that they wear, the visitor is there to make a proposal to Joan and Daniel Madrox. His name is Damian Tryp. Receiving lukewarm response, Mr. Tryp tells the couple that he doesn’t think they truly appreciate how much his organization has to offer James… “Jamie,” one of them interrupts. “He prefers ‘Jamie.’”</p><p>Begging their pardon, he continues. If they have Jamie join the Singularity team, his future will be assured. They’ve actually been corresponding with Charles Xavier, Daniel explains, practically since Jamie was born… When Tryp replies that Xavier is not the right person to attend to Jamie’s needs, Daniel counters that he doesn’t know that he <i>agrees</i>.</p><p>That’s why he’s there to convince him, Tryp explains. He and Joan… they’re both scientists. People of learning. He would think their minds would be open to… possibilities. Their minds <i>are</i> open, Daniel replies. But he shows up there, out of the blue… somehow he knows everything about them and Jamie… But, continues Joan to Tryp, they know nothing about him… and he says he’s better qualified than Xavier… …Whom no one can dispute is the foremost expert on mutants, Daniel concludes. Well, Tryp rejoins with a wry smile, when did he say <i>Jamie</i> was a <i>mutant</i>?</p><p>For a long moment, Daniel and Joan Madrox consider Damian Tryp’s statement. Finally speaking, Daniel tells his visitor that he doesn’t understand. He said that he <i>knew</i> about his multiple powers. Obviously he’s a mutant! In the delivery room, the doctor slapped him and he split… From the moment he was born, Joan continues, it was evident. Except a mutant’s powers don’t <i>present</i> themselves when he’s born, do they? They surface when he’s an <i>adolescent</i>. How do they <i>explain</i> that discrepancy? How does Xavier?</p><p>When the best either can offer is that there are always exceptions, Tryp presses his point. Are <i>all</i> their scientific explanations that half-hearted and unconvincing? Let him tell them about changelings, he asks them. “Like the old legends about fairies and goblins switching our human babies for their own?” he is asked. <i>Legends. Stories. The arena of “once upon a time”</i> Tryp says. Very well: once upon a time… parents of children who were like Jamie… different… freakish at birth… They’d leave them overnight on piles of <i>manure</i> on Christmas Eve, hoping they’d be switched back. The infants died. The end.</p><p>“Homo superior,” Tryp continues, did <i>not</i> spring into existence overnight. Before them, there were being like Jamie. “Like <i>myself</i>.” <i>Changelings</i>, he continues, <i>Replacement people.</i> <i>Killcrops…</i> That’s his personal favorite. They were blamed for poor harvests. Heh. And ninety-nine times out of a hundred, they were <i>murdered</i> in infancy. But, nature is <i>ever</i> adaptive. “Homo killcrop” gave way to Homo superior, and the lethal change was buried until adolescence, <i>upping</i> the survival likelihood. Every so often, though, a Killcrop still… wait for it… crops up. Jamie, Tryp tells the Madroxes, is a genetic throwback to an even more dangerous time. His needs will be <i>different</i>. They <i>dare</i> not entrust him to anyone but him.</p><p>Having heard enough, Daniel Madrox thanks Damian Tryp for coming by… but they trust themselves to do what’s right by their boy. If she may ask, Joan interjects, <i>out of scientific curiosity</i>… “What is a Killcrop power?” Tryp finishes. They are varied, he explains. The most pertinent to them would be elemental manipulation. Winds, for example. Why, he could create a <i>tornado</i> that could kill the both of them, and no one would think it anything other than an act of God. “And who knows,” he concludes with a devilish grin. “Perhaps they’d be right.” With that, Damian Tryp bids the couple a “good day” and takes his leave.</p><p>Outside the house, Damian runs into the young Jamie Madrox, still in his pre-teen years and clad in the environment suit designed by his parents. Greeting Tryp with a question from what he overheard of the conversation with his parents, Jamie haltingly asks if he is not a mutant. Touching Jamie’s chin, Tryp replies that he doesn’t remember saving that. Does he remember him saying that? For that matter… does he remember him at all? His eyes now glossy under the spell of Damian Tryp, Jamie answers, “No.” Departing Jamie and the farm, Tryp replies that he didn’t think so.</p><p>(today)</p><p><i>He… what?</i> Jamie Madrox asks. “Did you say…?” He disappeared, Guido repeats, completely flustered at the news himself. How could Buchanan have <i>disappeared</i>? Madrox asks. He was supposed to bring him to the bank, Monet reminds Guido, stick with him and bring his back! He’s made a mess of it…</p><p>Interrupting, her Jamie tells Monet to shut up or he’ll… Considering his next words, Jamie changes tones, apologizing. Returning to the subject of Buchanan, he asks Guido just to walk him through this. He brought him to the bank… And the bank lady said he had to be alone when he opened the lock box, Guido continues. Rules or something. These days, with the government breathing down every super-guy’s neck, he didn’t want to cause a scene. Cause them more grief. So he waited in the lobby. So, Guido continues, he’s taking forever. He asks the bank lady to check on him… next thing he knows, she comes back, white as a sheet, says he’s gone.</p><p>Great, Jamie laments. A locked room mystery. He <i>sucks</i> at locked door mysteries. Probably someone who phases, Monet suggests. Like Kitty does. Grabbed him.</p><p>Distraught as ever, Guido asks how could he have screwed this up, but Rahne tries to tell him it’s not his fault. Placing his arm around her, Guido replies that it’s nice of her to say. As she goes to reply that she’s not just doing so, Jamie notices Rahne suddenly tense. Her eyes wide, she looks at the hand Guido has placed around her shoulder, her nostrils flaring. Jamie hears a low growl from her throat. However, it’s when he sees her glaring eyes stare at Guido’s immense hand and her furrowed brow that he asks her “What the hell…?”</p><p>As her face begins to transform lupine, ever so slightly, Rahne glances up at Guido. She tells him that she smells blood on his hand. Traces of <i>spittle</i>. He wiped it clean, but the scent’s still there. <i>His</i> scent. Buchanan’s. Genuinely shocked, Guido ask Rahne what she’s talking about. He told her… <i>Aye</i>, Rahne rejoins. She knows what he said. Still shocked, Guido proclaims that this is <i>nuts</i>! Why would he have his body fluids on his hands? “That’s what <i>I’d</i> like to know,” Jamie replies. Calling out Monet’s name, he orders her to <i>take him</i>.</p><p>Half a moment later, Monet has leapt to Guido, her outstretched hand making contact with his head. As Guido bucks at the contact, Jamie silently notes that only she could pull this off. She’s got the strength to hang on… and the telepathic prowess to push her way into Guido’s mind. See what’s happening. Within Guido’s mind, however, the battle is as fierce as the physical one. Another Guido, one much darker than the other, yells at Monet to knock it off; get out of his head. Keeping this “other” Guido’s self company are the grinning and smiling forms of Damian Tryp, Sr.</p><p>Back in the real world, Monet has her answer. She informs Jamie that Guido’s been flipped. He’s working for Singularity. To this, she gives the coup de grace. <i>She thinks he killed Buchanan</i>.</p><p>A moment later, Monet finds herself thrown through the wall of X-Factor’s building and into the sidewalk outside by a roaring Guido. Before they can react, Guido then quickly grabs Rahne and tosses her into Jamie, knocking him against the wall. Though Jamie is knocked out, his newly-created dupe calls out to Guido. “You want a <i>piece</i> of me?!?? You wanna dance? <i>Let’s dance</i>!!! The darker Guido now very much in control, snarls a “fine” before attacking.</p><p>However, Guido himself is laid low by the sonic scream of Siryn, who knocks Guido off of his feet and into the already crumbling wall. Returning to her feet, Rahne thanks Siryn. Her “doggy-ears” will be ringing for a week, <i>but thanks</i>. A thought occurring, Siryn asks the group where Layla is. As weird as she is, she doesn’t deserve to get killed by a tossed Monet. Appearing out from behind the rubble, Layla thanks Siryn for her concern, but she is fine. But, she should know… she is <i>so</i> not cleaning this up.</p><p>Just arriving on the scene, Rictor views the rubble and spies Guido among it. Calling out to him, he asks what happened. Are they under attack? Who…? Much to Rictor’s surprise, Guido suddenly grabs Rictor’s head in his immense grip, then yelling to the rest of the team to back off, or he’ll bust him like a piñata. Attempting to appeal to Guido, Jamie tells him that he’s not in his right mind. Jamie’s right, Monet agrees. This, right here… It’s <i>another</i> personality. She thinks it was created via hypnosis. Her probe brought it to the surface. He can…</p><p>Through gritted teeth, Guido interrupts her, telling Money that, if she doesn’t show up, Rictor is dead. When Rictor then feebly points out that that’ll just encourage her, Guido then tells him to shut up too… Guido’s words are replaced with searing pain. As he grabs his ears, yelling as, all the while, black smoke begins to rise from his back. Dumbstruck at the sight, the rest of X-Factor can smell the hideous stink of charring flesh. Though there is no visible damage, Jamie thinks that it’s like Guido’s burning from the inside out.</p><p>Not taking his eyes off of Guido, Jamie asks Monet if she is doing this. Emphatically replying that she is not, Money adds that maybe Tryp is. A failsafe… The answer, however, comes from another quarter, as the team sees the black smoke approach the outstretched hand of Quicksilver and dance around his fingers.</p><p>“Yes,” Quicksilver states to no one in particular. “Just as I thought.” When Jamie calls out to him, Quicksilver tells him hello, adding that he’s looking well. After Jamie then asks what he did, Pietro replies that he’d been curious to see what would happen if he applied the restorative properties of the Terragen Mists to a mutant who had <i>not</i> lost his powers. His theory, he continues, was that there would be a sort of cellular feedback, like an overloaded sound system. He was right. Guido will recover, but probably be out for <i>hours</i>.</p><p>Taking this in, Layla asks if he’s saying he can take down <i>any</i> mutant… “Just by <i>touching</i> them?” Monet finishes. It seems so, Pietro grins. <i>Interesting</i> development, isn’t it? By the way, Pietro then adds, as a former mutant… and a <i>close</i> friend, Rictor is under <i>his</i> protection now. <i>Anyone</i> who abuses him will be dealt with <i>harshly</i>… by <i>him</i>. Pietro asks them to spread the word. Turning around and departing, Pietro tells X-Factor to enjoy the rest of their day.</p><p>A little later, the members of X-Factor lounge in their HQ, trying to take stock of their situation, while Rictor watches over the shackled Guido. Speaking of Guido’s hypnosis, Madrox asks if it’s like the Manchurian Candidate. Mocking this, Layla tells Jamie that she thought he only watched film noir. Yes, she tells him. She thinks it’s just like the “Manchurian Candidate.” At some point in the past, Layla continues as she goes for a PDA phone attached to the computer, Singularity made Guido into a sleeper agent. They’d control him by calling his phone and speaking some sort of <i>code</i> word. Examining the phone, she confirms, telling them that in the incoming calls on his phone list a number traceable to <i>Singularity Investigations</i>.</p><p>Cursing, Madrox laments that he should have realized. When Rahne asks how, he replies that Guido was different from the <i>old</i> days. <i>Tougher</i> - more <i>threatening</i>… He didn’t call people “blorks” anymore… He chalked it up to his having that fallout with Lila Cheney he wouldn’t talk about…</p><p>Interrupting, Monet suggests that it <i>might</i> be that he couldn’t recall what happened with Lila and was covering. His kind of thing could cause <i>memory</i> gaps. Like the other day, she continues, when they were talking about Sean Cassidy dying and he thought it was the actor. Guido would have <i>known</i> they meant Banshee. Instead of getting mad, he should have…</p><p>With the conversation moving to the subject of her father’s death, Theresa interrupts, yelling that that’s enough. It’s a <i>team</i> screw-up, she says. They can <i>mea culpa</i> themselves to death over it, or they can <i>do</i> something about it.</p><p>Agreeing, Jamie suggests that they figure this out. They <i>know</i> Singularity is involved in developing deadly virus. They know Buchanan was part of it, and now he’s dead. Still engrossed in the PDA phone, Layla points out that Buchanan had copies of his research in a safe deposit box. But, Monet chimes in, if there were copies, there have to be originals. Which are probably in Buchanan’s office at Singularity, Rahne then adds. Or maybe at his home.</p><p>Having heard enough and made a decision, Madrox tells Layla that he wants her to do research into Buchanan. Get his home number. See if he has a wife. Find a… Seemingly oblivious to Jamie’s instructions, Layla has already acquired the information and has placed a phone call on the PDA phone. Addressing Mrs. Buchanan, Layla informs her that she has Jamie Madrox calling for her. Asked in turn who she is, Lyla informs Mrs. Buchanan that she is Layla Miller. She kn… Incredulous, Jamie interrupts, telling Layla to just give him the damned phone.</p><p>A few moments later, Mrs. Buchanan tells Jamie that, no, Henry doesn’t every do S.I. research there. He always makes a point of keeping home separate from work. Then asked about that, she replies that he works in the S.I. building, thirty-second floor. But… certainly Henry could tell him that himself. The thought occurring to her, Mrs. Buchanan asks where he is and if she can speak to him.</p><p>Stammering at what to say, Jamie is quickly saved by Layla, who whispers “incommunicado.” Relaying that, Jamie adds that Mr. Buchanan is at a secure location for his own safety. Wishing to add more, Layla then whispers that “he’s” worried about her, which Jamie passes along.</p><p>On the other end, Mrs. Buchanan replies that she knows. He told her to pack her bags and start driving. She was almost out the door when he called. He had the right idea, Jamie tells her. Does she have a cell phone number so they can stay in touch? Receiving it, Jamie repeats the number out loud for Layla to write down. He then instructs Mrs. Buchanan to get on the road. They’ll be in touch.</p><p>After Jamie has hung up, Monet sarcastically states what was not said. “Oh, yeah, and by the way, your husband’s dead and one of our guys killed him. But don’t worry, we’ll prorate you for our services.” Uninterested in her dark humor, Jamie tells Monet “not now.” Right now, he tells her, they figure out a way to get into Singularity. Try to get into Buchanan’s workspace and his files, assuming they’re still there.</p><p>Obviously, Rahne opines, they go in at night. A little <i>too</i> obviously, Jamie counters. They’ll have security. They’ll have guards. A night shift. Probably even booby traps. They don’t need stealth. They need <i>confusion</i> and everyone <i>gone</i>. A situation where they can get in and out. In short… they need the element of surprise.</p><p>As the group continues their discussion, Mrs. Buchanan finishes her preparations, writing a note to the mailman for holding their mail until further notice. After carefully placing it in an envelope, she holds it in her mouth as she uses her hands – and shoulders – to carry her bags. However, as she opens the door, shock causes her mouth to open and the envelope to fall to the front step. Standing in the doorway is a youthful man, well groomed and in a brown suit. Smiling wryly, he introduces himself as Damian Tryp and asks if he can <i>help</i> her with those bags.</p><p>Outside the building which houses Singularity Investigations headquarters, emergency vehicles, including police cars, an ambulance and a fire truck, arrive on the scene. Emerging from the building, along with the rest of Singularity’s employees, Damian Tryp Sr. introduces himself to Agent Brody of the FBI and informs him that he owns the building. He assures the agent that this is <i>nonsense</i>. Assuring Mr. Tryp right back, Agent Brody tells him that they at the FBI take bomb threats very seriously. In this case, he continues, someone called them, Homeland Security, the fire department and the police.</p><p>Unconvinced, Tryp Sr. tells Agent Brody that someone’s having him off. Their own security systems are… It’s impossible is all he’s saying, he concludes instead, thinking better of his earlier line. So, he suggests, the agent can send his men home and… Interrupting Tryp, Agent Brody says that he doesn’t have a choice. <i>They</i> don’t have a choice. This has to be done by the numbers. Everyone clears out and they do their job. End of story.</p><p>As the agent and Damian Tryp Sr. continue their conversation, two firemen in hazard suits make their way into the building. Once inside, they soon find two Singularity security guards at their posts, watching feeds on security cameras. Yelling an inquiry as to what the hell they are still doing there, one of the firemen orders them to get out of they will have them arrested and <i>dragged</i> out! Acquiescing, one of the guards states that if he gets fired because of this, he’s suing the city. Giving the guard a sarcastic “whatever,” the fireman instructs the two to get down to the street like everybody else.</p><p>As soon as the two leave, one of the firemen says “perfect.” A moment later, the firemen’s helmets have been removed, as Theresa and Rictor no longer fear getting caught. As Rictor manipulates some controls, Theresa makes a call via her radio headset. Identifying herself as “Screaming Mimi,” she informs “Schizoid Man” that “Big Brother” is no longer watching or recording. They’re free to go. Meanwhile, high above the street outside, Monet floats toward the Singularity building, with Rahne and Jamie in tow. Replying that he hears her, Jamie tells “Mimi” that they’re on it.</p><p>A few minutes later, the three are inside the building from the roof and begin their descent. When Rahne asks him how long until the squads reach the thirty-second floor, Jamie replies that he’s hoping at least half an hour, since they have to clear the first thirty-one floors. As they find and enter the floor of Buchanan’s office, Monet asks Jamie if he does realize that calling in a bomb scare is… Oh, what’s the word…? “A felony?” he asks. That’s it, she replies.</p><p>So is generating a virus to kill mutants and hypnotizing someone into murder, Jamie then adds. He’s fighting fire with firemen. His conscience is clear. Moving up behind Jamie, Monet tells him that she <i>loves</i> it when he talks tough. As Monet continues on, a surprised Rahne asks Jamie if Monet just grabbed his “rump.” When he defends that she was pushing him aside, Rahne rejoins that it sure <i>looked</i> like… Trying his best to change the subject, Jamie suggests that they go.</p><p>A moment later, Monet has found the Buchanan’s office and yells to the others. Moving to the room, Jamie also notices that Tryp’s office is just down the hall. He’ll go down there while they… Jamie’s voice trails as he looks into the office. Likewise, Rahne and Monet are struck dumb by what they see. It is a familiar-looking older man, dressed in green robes. His hair is silver-grey and flows to below his shoulders. His beard and moustache are of like length.</p><p>Addressing Madrox by name, the old man tells him that he thinks he should remain. He’s been waiting for him. His name is Damian Tryp, he says. He wishes to explain to Jamie why he’s on the <i>wrong</i> side… Why Singularity is trying to save the future of mankind… and how <i>X-Factor’s</i> activities may well destroy <i>everything</i>.</p><p>This said, the elder Damian Tryp suggests to Jamie that he have a seat. There’s water in the fridge if he’s thirsty.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em><u><i>Overview:</i></u></em></p><p>It all climaxes here: The final showdown with Mr. Tryp and Singularity, X-Factor’s desperate race to save all the former mutants from annihilation, and the truth behind the shocking traitor in their midst.</p><p><strong><u><b>Issue Summary:</b></u></strong></p><p>(years from now)</p><p>Clustered together in makeshift shelters beneath the surface of civilization, a few half-clothed humans attempt to eke out an existence. Some still wearing glasses and reading, they cling to a society that has left them behind. Others are more concerned with food, and hungrily share what little they are able to scrape out of what’s left behind by others. As a constant reminder of their plight, they feast beneath graffiti, which reads in large, scarlet letters – “no more humans.”</p><p>Suddenly, the repast is interrupted by arcing electricity, which ravages their bodies, killing them with only a few moments to scream in pain. The cause of their deaths are two figures, one male and one female, who are silhouetted in black, with only their fiery, electric-blue eyes flaring in the darkness. Continuing down the tunnel, the male calls for his counterpart to follow him down. A few moments later, they discover a larger room, a disheveled, crude laboratory, manned by two men in lab coats. In the center of the room is the elder form of Damian Tryp, floating over a concave hemisphere, his eyes closed and arms crossed over his bare chest.</p><p>Without a word, the female intruder opens her mouth and breathes fires, which engulfs both scientists. Making a straight line to the floating Tryp, the male reaches out for him, but finds his hand passing through. Suddenly, the entire base begins to self-destruct into flames, causing the two to take note. When they look back to where Tryp was a moment earlier… they find he is gone. Activating his wrist communicator, the male intruder calls in his report. “This is X-Factor unit 27. Target Tryp located and believed terminated.”</p><p>(now)</p><p>Speaking to Madrox, Rahne and Monet, the elder Damian Tryp explains that it is said that any sufficiently advanced technology will be indistinguishable from magic. The same could be said of sufficiently advanced biology. There is no scientific, rational means of explaining how on could just wave one’s hands and command the elements, or fly… or generate lightening bolts from one’s eyes. In the old days, the powerless “normal people” cried “witch” and burned or hung those who displayed such abilities.</p><p>In his day, however… in days to come… many, many years from now… the normal people just die. He is not a normal person. Never <em>has</em> been. When the humans were many and his kind was few, he continues, he despised them. But then the humans became few, and his kind many… and insane… Drunk with power, glorying their multitudes. He tried to warn them of their follow, he explains, but they did not listen. All right, actually… they did. They simple didn’t like what they heard. In fact, they didn’t like it a <em>lot</em>.</p><p>His greatest wish was for immortality, he continues, and he traveled far and wide, studied dark arts. Acquired much knowledge to achieve that aim. The old saying about being wary of what you wish for lest you get it is a very <em>sage</em> one. For a doomed race, humans excelled at sayings. Mutant powers can continue to mutate, given enough time. His being attuned to the elemental nature of the Earth linked him to their planet’s essence. He began to exist at all points in his own lifelines. A true “multiple man” if they will. His present and past forms are solid enough, since time has caught up with them. <em>He</em> is more… <em>elusive</em>… since the future remains mutable. There is, however, a problem.</p><p>His body – his very existence – has become unstable. So in the future, he developed machinery to perpetuate himself. Not unlike a feeble individual hooked up to life support. Thus does he continue to survive, aided by a small band of supporters… a band which, he fears, has shrunk to non-existence. They tried to protect him… he, an anomaly, existing simultaneously in all times but none. A living puzzle of quantum mechanics. Some people despise puzzles. Alexander the Great famously was confronted with the Gordian knot and “solved” it by hacking it in twain with his sword. His spirit lives on. “As do I.”</p><p>He has seen the future, X-Factor, he tells them. Their future. The future of all mankind. It is neither pleasant nor desirable. Nor is it one, he regrets to say… that he is, at the moment, a part of. “I am <em>trapped</em> between states of existence. I am neither <em>here</em> nor <em>there</em>. The reason for this… is because there are mutants. Lots of them. The reason there are lots of mutants… is you.”</p><p>As Madrox, Rahne and Monet look dumbstruck, the elder Damian Tryp tells them that he knows it’s a lot to process all at once. “It… certainly is,” Madrox replies, then adding that when you’re having that much manure dumped on you at on you at one time, the smell can be pretty over-whelming. Looking away slightly, Tryp rejoins that he suspected that he might have doubts. He is prepared to deal with them…</p><p>Suddenly turning into her half-wolf form, Rahne snarls with her fangs that she’s prepared to deal with him! Jamie attempts to wave her back, but Rahne is resolute. She tells him that she’s getting a <em>whiff</em> of a scent off of him. He’s not as “not there” as he’s trying to make them think! And, she continues, she’s betting he’s involved in what happened to Guido… which means…</p><p>Interrupting her, Tryp tells Rahne that one would think she’d have learned respect for her elders. Here, he says, let him grant her a peek at the shape of things to come. Quickly moving to Rahne’s position, Tryp reaches out his left hand, slashing the side of her lupine face with his fingernail, spraying blood. Rahne has already reverted to her human form when Tryp follows up his attack, tossing Rahne across the room. Madrox himself only has time to call out Rahne’s name before Tryp tosses him as well into several office chairs, generating a new duplicate at the same time. Temper, Tryp tells him as he does so. Hysterics will not aid him.</p><p>They are leaders, Tryp continues, referring to them both. They should conduct themselves accordingly. Beginning to rise, the newly generated duplicate is in panic. Swearing to himself, the dupe proclaims that the stuff Tryp is saying… he can’t take it! Keep him away! The original Jamie tries to calm down the duplicate, but he is inconsolable. Sprinting out the door, the duplicate disappears into the hallway, his voice trailing. “<em>You</em> calm down! I need to get out of here! I need to…”</p><p>“Order a pizza? For delivery? Yes, I’ll hold.” As she is placed on hold, Layla Miller sings along with the hold music. <em>Woman, the way you went your way, getting under my skin, bum bum bum da dum…</em> Reaching out to the phone console, Layla presses line two and makes a second call. Verifying that she’s reached Doug’s Hardware, she says hello to “Doug” and tells him it’s Layla Miller. Getting to business, she asks if he can shoot her over a pair of bolt cutters, like, now? Sighing at his response, she tells him okay, fine. “Good-to-Go” to win in the second race, 40-to-1 odds. Now when can she… Ten minutes? Outstanding, she tells him. Bye.</p><p>Reaching over to line one, Layla asks the pizzeria if they are still there. Finding that they are, Layla orders one regular pie, extra cheese. 367 Greenwich Avenue. Thirty minutes? Outstanding. Bye. Continuing to sing, Layla dials another number, shortly informing the party who answers that she would like to order a pizza to be delivered. Do they still have that thirty minute thing going? Outstanding, she replies to their answer response.</p><p>A strong wind blows down the street outside the Singularity building. Women struggle to keep their dresses from blowing up, as firemen and employees of Singularity wonder where this hurricane-like gust came from. Trying to regain control of the chaotic situation, FBI Agent Brody orders his men to get those people back <em>away</em> from the building. <em>Back!!</em> Turning back to whom he was just conversing with, Brody tells Damian Try Sr. that he’s going to have to ask him and his people to clear he entire area while… Agent Brody’s voice trails as he finds himself alone, the owner of Singularity Investigations having disappeared.</p><p>Back in the evacuated building, Damian Tryp Jr. congratulates his “father” on the distraction. He <em>thought</em> he’d appreciate it “my son,” Sr. replies. Turning to the subject of Alix Buchanan, Sr. asks his Jr. if she is being attended to. Replying that she is, Tryp Jr. adds that she’s being transported to a secure location. Good, Sr. rejoins. She’ll be valuable leverage. Repeating the word “leverage,” Jr. asks if his father thinks… That they’re under attack? Sr. asks. It’s always <em>safer</em> to proceed on that assumption. He’s betting it’s X-Factor. And he’s thinking they should take them down permanently. Moving to the elevator, Tryp Jr. replies that it’s about bloody time.</p><p>In the building’s security room, Rictor calls out to Theresa, telling her to come back to the computer station at which he sits. There’s some stuff in there she should be checking out… He thinks this may be related to the virus they’re trying to stop. It says “test subjects” – and he <em>recognizes</em> some of these names... They’re former mutants.</p><p>Not receiving a response, Rictor calls again over the wireless headset, even calling her temporary codename of “Screaming Mimi.” Is she copying this…? Finally responding, Siryn tells Rictor that she heard him. She’s just… a little distracted. It appears, she continues, that Singularity Investigations is rather well armed. When Rictor asks <em>how</em> well armed, Theresa replies “pretty darned,” as she gazes upon an arsenal room, containing automatic rifles, pistols, rocket launchers, machine guns and bombs.</p><p>On the 32nd floor, Monet checks Rahne’s pulse, informing the panicking Madrox to calm down. She can’t sense a thing if he’s this frantic. His brow furrowed in anger, the elder Damian Tryp informs Monet that what she will sense is that the young lady is in deep shock. She will recover. Humanity, however, will not, he continues, if they persist in their course to safeguard the former mutants. When Monet asks what he’s talking about, Tryp replies that she’s talking about the fact that, once having learned the truth behind the Decimation… X-Factor was instrumental in restoring the mutants to their powers. At a time when the X-Men did nothing, X-Factor got the job done, and thus became revered by all mutants.</p><p>But, he continues, they did not know what they unleashed. They tilted the balance in the other direction. “No more mutants?” Try “No more humans.” They unleashed chaos, but he senses it is better to show rather than to tell. And tapping her psychic powers will enable him to… As Tryp reaches out for her, Monet recoils, telling “Casper” that he’s not getting his ghostly hands on her. Fortunately enough, Tryp replies, he doesn’t have to.</p><p>Without further warning, blue arc of electricity shoot from Tryp’s forehead. Monet cries out and Jamie tries to dodge, except there’s nowhere to go, and the energy passes with through Monet and into him. For Jamie Madrox, the world shifts around him. There’s a rushing sound in his head, like he’s being thrown at high speed down a tunnel – and then he hears a voice in his head. His voice. Tryp-the-Eldest, Tryp-the-light-fantastic. And he’s telling Jamie that things happen for a reason. That the Decimation was part of the natural order. That their reversing of it went <em>against</em> it. That in combating the effects of chaos… they unleashed it even more.</p><p>Once again on solid ground, Jamie Madrox finds himself in what was once Times Square. Now in ruins, the cause of it is all around him, as a dozen of flying mutants wield unearthly energies, making havoc with the city. The bodies of several humans lie inert on the rubble strewn about him.</p><p>The meek don’t inherit the Earth, Jamie realizes. <em>Mutants</em> do. In this new world, the lessons of Charles Xavier are lost in a battleground of fire and fury. Absolute power corrupting absolutely. Conquering the humans isn’t that much of a chore. It’s accomplished easily enough. But it creates a power vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum. So the mutants turn against each other, in a war that lays waste to the populace… to the world.</p><p>Speaking to the horrified Madrox, Tryp’s voice says, “Now do you see? We’re creating a virus to kill all the former mutants… so they don’t recover their abilities. It was either destroy them… or destroy <em>you</em>. We’re prepared for both contingencies. Either way, <em>something</em> has to go. Because the world of my future… it’s no world at all.”</p><p><em>Get out of my head!!!!</em> yells Monet, returning herself and Madrox to the land of the here and now. His vision now bestowed, Tryp asks the two if they now see. Now, do they understand? Propping himself against the wall in order to stand up, Jamie replies that it’s lie. It has to be… all lies. It’s… Just rising herself, Monet coldly tells Jamie that it’s not. Her face turning to one of fear, she tells the startled Jamie that at least Tryp <em>believes</em> it’s not. That future… it… She tells Jamie that she’s going on nothing but instinct, but she… she thinks he’s on the level.</p><p>Still incredulous, Jaime asks Monet what she’s saying. That they just <em>roll over</em>? Let people die? Let… “No!” he finally yells. “<em>Screw that!</em>” Turning to Tryp, Jamie tells him that he may stink at making decisions, but not this one! He’s not letting people die! People are going to die whether he “let’s” them or not, Tryp rejoins. Beginning, he continues, with Alix Buchanan… the wife of the late, lamented Professor Buchanan. When this startles Jamie even more, Tryp says that he’s afraid so. You see… even as they speak, Mrs. Buchanan is being driven to a secure location. If X-Factor does not vacate this building immediately, her life is forfeit.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Singularity guard sits in an unmarked, white van, stopped in a traffic jam. When his partner returns and enters the passenger’s side, he informs the driver that he’s not going to believe this: Apparently, four pizza delivery trucks <em>collided</em> at an intersection, but it’s a Godawful mess. Traffic ain’t moving for blocks. Unconcerned by this, the driver replies with a “whatever.” It’s isn’t like their passenger’s going anywhere.</p><p>Unknown to either guard, the back doors of the van are swung wide open, a pair of bolt cutters propped against on of the open doors.</p><p>As they race down the hall, Rictor asks Siryn where they’re going. “Up,” she replies. She’s been tapping into the bomb squad’s talkback. They’re on the 18th floor. So they want to… Siryn’s words trail as a single dart impacts into her collar. Managing an “owww!” her eyes go wide in fright, as she mutters, “not again…” As she collapses, Damian Tryp Sr. grabs Rictor’s hands, causing him to drop the files her was carrying. Holding the gun that fired the dart, Damian Tryp Jr. tells Siryn that he’s afraid so. Another tranq dart to paralyze her vocal cords and mute her sonic power. Struggling as Sr. places his hands behind his backs, Rictor yells “Leggo!” Hearing this, Jr. mocks the famed “Leggo” strategy. That always works, he sarcastically quips.</p><p>Moving to the downed Siryn, Tryp Jr. grabs her by the hair and tells her he tried to give her a warning the first time. Apparently, it didn’t take. This time… When Theresa tries to respond, Tryp asks her if she has something to say. He didn’t quite catch it, he mocks. “Speak up, loud as you can.” Finally doing so, Siryn says, <em>Kevlar… collar… you slimebag… You think I wasn’t prepared this time…?”</em></p><p>Realizing what she means, Damian Tryp Jr. has but a moment before the sonic scream of Siryn hurls him backwards. Acting quickly, however, Tryp Sr. effortlessly tosses Rictor toward Theresa, knocking her over. Rather than press the fight, Rictor and Theresa begin to flee, but are halted by Jamie, who is carrying the unconscious Rahne. Ordering them to stand down, he tells them they have to bail. There’s a hostage situation. Alix Buchanan…</p><p>Interrupting, Rictor points to he files on the floor, telling Jamie that they’ve got proof! <em>Right there</em>! They can… Interrupting Rictor in turn, Damian Tryp Sr. counters that what they have are confidential files that belong to Singularity. What the have are intruders who triggered panic just so they could invade their headquarters. Picking up the files and folders, Sr. states that he’ll take their legal position against Rictor’s anytime. The authorities are, what? – Ten stories below? He suggests they get out now.</p><p>Still holding the unconscious Rahne, Jamie narrows his eyes and informs the Messrs. Tryp that this isn’t over. They should count on it. “Oh, definitely,” Sr. replies. “Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” Jr. adds.</p><p>After they have left, Jr. asks Sr. how they knew about the Buchanan woman. Replying that he has no idea, Sr. suggests that perhaps their future incarnation told them. No matter. It… Sr.’s voice trails as he notices something within the surveillance room, telling his son that it seems that they have <em>forgotten</em> something. Entering the arsenal room, they find a Madrox duplicate hunched over. When Sr. asks who he might be, the dupe replies that Jamie called him “gutless.” When Tryp sarcastically replies that he can’t imagine why, the dupe rejoins that he can.</p><p>Standing up, he informs Tryp that it’s because he fooled him. He <em>does</em> that. Messes with him… probably cause he’s pretty messed up himself. Does he wan to know why? he asks Tryp. Because he remembers. That’s why. He remembers <em>him</em>.</p><p>Continuing, his back to the Tryps , the duplicate explains that erasing memories is like erasing computer files. You think they’re <em>gone</em>… ‘cept they’re <em>not</em>. They’re just lots harder to find. But he found it… found the memory of <em>him</em> creating the storm that killed his parents. And that memory makes him what he is today. When Tryp asks back what that might be, the dupe replies that he’s that part of Jamie that compels him to do the unexpected. Turning around, the duplicate sports a makeshift vest of dynamite, which circles his torso. In his right hand, the duplicate holds a push-button detonator. Damian Tryp Sr. and Jr. look on in abject terror.</p><p>Continuing his proclamation, the duplicate tells the two that he’s the fly in the ointment… The spanner in the words. He’s unpredictable. He’s the X-Fac…</p><p>With the “klick” of a button, the upper floors of the Singularity Investigations building erupt in a fiery explosion.</p><p>Propelled into the air in the world outside, Jamie Madrox worries more about the sudden realization than his distance to the ground. Cursing repeatedly, Jamie suddenly remembers. Tryp was there… He was there, talking to his <em>parents</em> when he was a kid…</p><p>Jamie’s descent is suddenly halted as Monet grabs his wrist with her left hand, her right arm wrapped around the limp Rahne. Nearby, Siryn likewise has Rictor aloft with her sonic scream. When Monet yells for Jamie to snap out of it, he incoherently tells her that he told him that he… that he wasn’t a <em>mutant</em>… He’s… something else… He <em>threatened</em> them! He…</p><p>Trying to make sense of his ramblings, Monet asks Madrox what happened. He twisted loose from her! What’s… When Jamie replies, “He killed them…” she asks back who killed who. “Tryp,” Jamie replies. “He… He killed my parents.” It wasn’t a “freak tornado,” he continues. It was… was <em>him</em>. He must’ve been watching him for years after that, waiting… He killed them… and his dupe just killed <em>Tryp</em>… and <em>himelf</em>… “When the dupe died,” Jamie explains, “I <em>felt</em> it, and all the memories, they came… came flooding back… And the strongest feeling of all… he was… <em>relieved</em>… that they didn’t have to remember it anymore…</p><p>Disgusted at the surge of knowledge and emotions, Jamie asks Monet just to get him home.</p><p>Back at X-Factor’s HQ, Layla receives an interesting e-mail… from a Singularity account with an attachment. “Dear Layla,” she reads, “Here’s evidence of Singularity’s virus scheme. I’m trying an e-mail backup just in case we don’t manager to get the files out of the building. –Ric.”</p><p>“P.S.” she continues. “I still don’t trust you, you little freak.” Responding with an <em>awww</em>, Layla announces to Alix Buchanan that that’s so sweet.</p><p>Sitting behind, Alix tells Layla that she doesn’t understand. How did she know where she was to get her out? Where’s Henry? She… she… Shrugging her shoulders, Layla tells Mrs. Buchanan that she’s in shock. Does she know what’s good for that? Milk. Big glass of milk.</p><p>A few moments later, Layla stands at the open refrigerator, pouring milk into a glass. As she pours with a “ho-hum,” she is suddenly startled when a voice calls out to her. “So… <em>You’re</em> the reason we’ve had so much trouble,” the voice says to her. “We thought it was <em>Rictor’s</em> joining the group… but it was <em>you</em>. Standing before the frozen Layla Miller is the ghostly form of the elder Damian Tryp.</p><p>They should have been partners, the elder Tryp tells her. Instead, they’ve been operating at cross purposes. And now, his earlier selves are dead. Were he not <em>trapped</em> between time, he would be as well. Be wary, Layla Miller, he tells her. They <em>know</em> each other now. When chaos battles order, a balance is reached. When <em>two</em> chaotic forces battle… expect the unexpected.</p><p>With that, Damian Tryp has vanished, leaving Layla Miller alone, but still very much frozen in shock. Continuing to pour in her immobile state, her glass is now overflowing with milk, which continues to fall to the floor, forming a puddle as it splatters.</p>",

Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin, is visited in prison by his attorney that they have been given the location of Spider-Man plus two (Mary Jane and Aunt May) in a motel. Fisk soon declares that he wishes a \"bonus\" to be delivered. As Spider-Man plans their next move with Cap and others, an assassin has Mary Jane and Aunt May in the sights of a sniper rifle.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>A new art team debuts with Part 1 of the 3-part \"Universal Law.\" Inhaling large quantities of toxic gases would be a bad idea for most people, but surely not a super-hero like Mr. Majestic. He could inhale those gases and expel them in the vacuum of space. No problem...right? Right? A super-hero cliche is turned on its head in MR. MAJESTIC #7, Part 1 of the 3-part \"Universal Law.\" Written by the popular MR. MAJESTIC team of Joe Casey and Brian Holguin, the issue also marks the debut of the series' ultra-cool new art team of Eric Canete (SUPERMAN 80- PAGE GIANT #2; designer, Aeon Flux) and Juan Vlasco (Cable). To save Times Square from an airborne toxin, Mr. Majestic sucks it into his mighty lungs, planning to exhale it out of harm's way in the void. But the journey into space with the toxin inside him causes Majestic to have mysterious and surreal hallucinations, which will have serious consequences for our hero.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>The Illuminati is a secret organization comprised of several of the world's most powerful heroes: Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, Black Bolt, King of the Inhumans, Charles Xavier, founder of the X-Men and mutant rights activist, Reed Richards,founding member of the Fantastic Four, Namor the Sub-Mariner, King of Atlantis and Iron Man (Anthony Stark), founding member of the Avengers.</p><p>These six men have worked together to mold and shape the status of the superhuman world and the world around it.</p><p>How and what they have done together has remained a mystery...</p><p>UNTIL NOW...</p><p>Writers Brian Michael Bendis ( Avengers, Ultimate Spider-Man) and Brian Reed ( Ms. Marvel) have joined together with Jim Cheung (Young Avengers) to reveal this untold story of the Marvel Universe and the Illuminati's actions affect today!</p><p>Years back during the Kree/Skrull war, the Illuminati proactively try to keep the war from spilling over towards the Earth.</p><p><b><i>SPOILERS</i></b></p><p>Years ago...</p><p>[On a Capital Skrull Ship over Throneworld]</p><p>Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII is hearing from one of his advisors that the Kree-Skrull War is over on account of Rick Jones, a \"single human\". Outraged, Dorrek demands an explanation as to how their superior fleet had been defeated. The advisor cautiously lays down the factors: explaining that the Earth's population of \"genetic atrocities\" (mutants) and so-called superheroes posed the biggest threat, and in conjunction with the competition from the Kree, the Skrulls' attempt to conquer Earth with a frontal attack was impossible.</p><p>The two are interrupted by the teleportation of the Illuminati, who introduce themselves as Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, Iron Man of the Avengers, Prince Namor of Atlantis, Doctor Stephen Strange of the mystic arts, Professor Charles Xavier of the \"genetic atrocities\", and Black Bolt of the Inhumans. Mr. Fantastic quickly declares that they traveled there to inform the Emperor that they will not tolerate another invasion of Earth and warns him against even approaching Earth space. Iron Man and Namor promise the Emperor retribution should he disregard their warnings. Dorrek is offended by their presence and swears that the Earth planet belongs to the Skrulls while promising to wipe out the human race, starting with their families. In acknowledgement, Iron Man asks Black Bolt what he has to say...</p><p>The Capital Skrull Ship explodes from the inside out, and the Illuminati are safely teleported aboard the nearby Quinjet by Doctor Strange. Namor rejoices at the ship's destruction, watching with pride from a window as it crashes down into the water below. When the rest of the Illuminati do not share his satisfaction, Namor comments that he'll just enjoy it enough for everyone then. Just then, the Quinjet is fired upon by multiple Skrull ships, despite being cloaked. The assault comes too fast for Doctor Strange or Professor X to aid in their escape, and the Quinjet is blown to pieces. The Illuminati drift in space, helpless.</p><p>Skrull scientists look upon their captured subjects. Mr. Fantastic is stretched in captivity to an enormous length and width, and the scientists are curious as to what the upper limits of his extension are. Namor is laid within a heated cell, deprived of nearly all moisture in the air as the scientists mock his existence as a \"homo superior\". Black Bolt is held in restraints with a beam immobilizing his vocal chords as the scientists comment on the perverse nature of the \"Kree-spawn\" and the Terrigen Mists. Professor X is held suspended in a containment field while the scientists explore his mutant DNA. Doctor Strange is held upside-down inside a spinning containment field while the scientists are confounded by his mystical powers and have called in priests from the Vovco Islands to look into them. The scientists then move onto study Iron Man's armor, which lies in pieces on a lab table. They comment on its primitive design in comparison to Skrull technology and state that it will go into the Royal Trophy Room, now that it has been dismantled. After discovering the armor kept Tony Stark's heart valves working, they are anxious to see how long he will survive without it.</p><p>Tony Stark sits naked alone in the brig. He is greeted by the Avengers, who crash through to rescue him. Stark knows better however, and tells the Skrull imposters that they always underestimate their opponents, asking them how dumb they think he is. The Skrull Quicksilver and Skrull Scarlet Witch insist that the exercise was a waste of time, but the Skrull Captain America and Skrull Thor think otherwise. The Skrull Thor theorizes that Stark doesn't expect his teammates to come and rescue him because no one knows they came there. He assaults Stark, who quickly incapacitates the Skrulls in unarmed combat, noting the training the real Captain America had given him beforehand. He puts on some pants taken from a Skrull and moves on with a Skrull rifle, freeing Charles Xavier from his confinement. Once free, Xavier assaults the Skrull scientists around him psychically until they are begging him to stop. Tony asks him if he's happened to have seen his armor, and Xavier replies that he hasn't while expressing concern for Tony's heart. Stark helps him move down the corridor to rescue the others. Namor exclaims that he would very much like to hit something, and Xavier alerts the two that the entire Skrull armada has been called. They quickly free Doctor Strange, who casts a spell to keep Stark's heart pumping for a little while longer. After recovering Black Bolt, the Illuminati arrive where Reed Richards is being painfully stretched. Namor recovers Richards and they make it into a large Skrull ship for their escape. Tony Stark pilots the Skrull ship out of the hangar, shooting into the atmosphere. As a countless number of Skrull attack ships open fire on their vessel, Black Bolt motions for them to open the back pod-bay. Doctor Strange refuses, stating that they are almost out of the atmosphere. Reed asks Strange if he can cast an illusion spell to aid in their escape, and Xavier helps \"sell\" it psychically.</p><p>As the Skrull armada bears down on the Illuminati's ship, a gigantic psychic illusion of Galactus appears before them. Many Skrulls, in their panic, collide into each other as the Illuminati flies off to safety. As they pass quietly by Saturn, Namor exclaims that they will come for them. Xavier tells him that the Skrulls were coming for them already. Stark replies that Namor is right, but at the very least, they made it clear that if they DO come at Earth, then the fight will be a real fight. Maybe now they'll look for someone else to pick on. The Illuminati pause, and as their ship nears Earth, Tony says \"well, at least now they know it'll be a GOOD fight.\"</p><p>Back on Throneworld, Emperor Dorrek sits in his broken throne among the ruins of his chambers. He asks his advisor if they got what they needed from the [Illuminati], and the advisor answers \"yes.\" The Emperor sullenly declares that it was worth it. He orders that the priests of the sciences get to work, exclaiming that no matter how long it takes, he will wait.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Having just shot the White Queen, Scott Summers is attacked by Cassandra Nova. However, prepared for her, he shoots her as well with a smile. Elsewhere, Blindfold is confronted by the feral Beast, but she has been instructed on how to handle him, per a plan put into motion months before by Cyclops and the Beast himself: a ball of yarn. Elsewhere in the Institute, Danger and Ord of the Breakworld are met by both Hisako and a mentally-recovered Wolverine. Though both manage to hold their own, it is the mentally recovered Beast who defeats the two with a device he had constructed to use against Magneto. Moving down to seek out Scott, the trio meet up with Scott, Piotr &amp; Hisako – as well as Kitty and Emma, whom Scott ordered Kitty to rescue from her makeshift prison below the Institute’s foundation. To their surprise, Scott informs them that they are not really facing the Hellfire Club, but manifestations of Emma’s telepathy, caused by a telepathic suggestion by Cassandra when she was imprisoned so long ago. As the X-Men discuss this, they are unaware that the still-mentally controlled Emma is telepathically downloading Cassandra Nova’s consciousness into the unwilling Hisako. Just as the transfer is complete – and just as Ord and Danger press their attack – all of the players are transported aboard a SWORD spacecraft, which begins to rocket toward the Breakworld. Left behind, the prophetic Blindfold informs a fellow student that not all of the X-Men will return…</p>",

    "description": "<p>Though the X-Men can hardly believe it, Emma informs them that the Danger Room has mutated – becoming a sentient being… and is angry. Immediately, they take steps remove its computer functions by having Colossus tear through it’s “brain,” but the Danger Room defends itself by activating the X-wing jet, using it to crash through the mansion and then fire upon the team with its ordinance. Inside the Danger Room, the room continues to communicate through the animated corpse of Wing. First, it creates a hellish world to frighten the students, then changing it to a desert, which is then filled with skulls instead of sand. All the while, the Danger Room entity speaks with Kitty, explaining its actions through cryptic riddles as to its origin, purpose and transcendence. Kitty realizes too late that her teammates actions outside to destroy the entity is actually freeing it, which was its plan all along. Moments after Wolverine succeeds in destroying the sphere housing its command core, the Danger Room entity uses the wreckage of the Institute to create a robotic body – and then asks the X-Men if they “shall begin.”</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>There's no turning back now. Peter has made the most important decision of his life. As the sides square off for the looming Civil War, he'll have to live with it. Now the big question is, what will this decision cost him? Part 2 (of 6). Spider-Man has revealed himself to the world as being Peter Parker. We see the reaction of those who know Spider-Man and Peter Parker.</em></p><p>After revealing his identity to the public, much to the rage of J. Jonah Jameson, Peter worries so much about his decision that he throws up in the White House bathroom. Arriving back in New York, Peter discovers Jameson is suing him. While many of his pasts friends and enemies react to the revelation of his identity, Peter enjoys a night with MJ before Tony's televised press conference announces that Spider-Man will help apprehend rogue superhumans who refuse to register. Angry that Tony did not ask him first, Peter goes out for some air with MJ but they are stalled by a group of reporters, from which a gunman appears and attempts to shoot Peter. Peter stops the gunman and eventually confronts Iron Man, who apologizes for not telling him of his new role but reminds him that he promised to support Tony no matter what. Iron Man takes Spidey to meet other pro-Registration Act heroes who are prepared to confront their rogue allies.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>CIVIL WAR TIE-IN! “THE WAR AT HOME” With Civil War in full-throttle mode, Spider-Man follows his conscience... and fast becomes a lightning rod for controversy. Unmasked and vunerable, this is Spider-Man as you've NEVER seen him! As soon as Iron Man overhears that Peter will no longer support the Registration Act, he attacks him and a battle ensues. Now on the run, Peter, Mary Jane, and Aunt May must find a new place to live. Spider-Man decides to publicly announce his opposition to the Act and goes on live television. Iron Man decides that Spider-Man needs to be brought down.</em></p><p>Iron Man tries to shut down Spidey's armores costume with a voice command but the web-slinger, prepared for this, overrides the system. Escaping into the sewers, Spidey reunites with MJ and May, who are hiding out in Midtown High. Later, the three take a room in the sleazy Motel 40. Spidey, back in his original costume, visits the Channel 9 television studio, where he interrupts the weather broadcast to announce to the world that he was wrong to support the Superhuman Registration Act. Watching Spidey's TV announcement, Iron Man orders a \"Cape Killer\" unit to bring the wall-crawler in.</p>",

After her disastrous fight with a teen assassin leaves Anya up the creek without a paddle, it’s up to Spidey to lend a hand to the new kid in town! Maybe he can give her tips on how to deal with members of the press – especially when they happen to be your investigative reporter dad tracking your new identity! Meanwhile, the harsh reality of collateral damage hits Anya like a ton of bricks…and lands one of her teammates in Intensive Care. Enough with the destiny stuff already!

    "description": "<em>It’s Field Day at the Xavier Institute! As the New Mutants and the Hellions battle for bragging rights, a long shadow from one of their pasts falls over the Xavier Institute! </em><br />   <br />As the Field Day exercise continues, Sofia tries to fly over Santo, who is blocking the way into the hedge maze. Julian blocks the way above with his telekinesis by putting up an invisible wall, and he and Sofia end up in a battle of wills, distracting Sofia from the task at hand. After a bit of urging, David comes up with a plan, but Brian uses his powers on him, making the others all run away from him. Josh, Laurie, and Kevin make it to the other side of the hedge maze and proceed with the plan to use Kevin’s power to wither a path through the hedge wall. David goes after Nori and helps her out as she used her entire charge to escape. As Jay arrives to where the object is hidden, Kevin, Laurie, and Josh make it through the wall and see that there is a live dragon at the center. Kevin decides to use his power on the dragon, but Josh stops him. Laurie tries to use her pheromones, but before she has a chance, Jay uses his special singing voice to calm the dragon. After a quick conference over Brian’s use of his powers, the Hellions are announced as the winners, and Josh goes off on Sofia for her lack of strategy in leading them. Josh and Nori both suggest that David take over leadership, but David tells them that he stands by Sofia. Later, Laurie finds Sofia crying in their room and decides to go have a talk with Josh about it. Cessily finds Kevin working on his industrial art and they talk for a while, and Cessily shows him that, because she is made of mercury, he can touch her without hurting her. Unfortunately, that isn’t the touch he was looking for. Outside, Josh plays basketball with Victor until he spots Rahne and tries to get her to go out with him again, but when she says no, he spots Laurie. She asks if they can talk about the Sofia thing, and he agrees and invites her to go out for dinner with him on a date, which makes both Rahne and Kevin jealous. Kevin joins Cessily to dinner in the cafeteria, and after a quick talk, Julian agrees to let him sit with them. Nearby, Sofia expresses her fears to David that the squad is angry with her, and he does his best to make her feel better, though to little success. Dani is upset that Kevin doesn’t seem to be taking to the rest of her kids, and Emma takes the opportunity to tell Dani that it is her fault. And just to make things perfect, Agent Justin Pierce arrives to arrest Kevin Ford for the murder of his father…",

    "description": "<p><em>The school is divided over the fate of young Kevin Ford, the mutant whose very touch can kill. Will the Xavier Institute allow him to be turned over to the authorities? And it only takes a testy situation like this to set fi</em></p><p>FBI agent Justin Pierce asks Kevin Ford to turn himself in for the death of his father. Though the agent is sympathetic, Emma Frost and Dani don’t believe Kevin can get a fair deal and refuse. Later, Pierce meets Dani in the coffee shop and explains that they have to show that mutants aren’t above the law. Dani considers his words and Noriko eavesdrops on their conversation. Later, she and her teammates decide to smuggle Kevin off-campus. They are stopped by Pierce and Dani makes up an excuse for them. The next day is hard for Kevin, as all students gossip about his accidentally killing his father and he further isolates himself. Fed up with everybody’s behavior, Hellion holds a speech in the cafeteria, telling them they should be ashamed of their behavior. Later, Dani calls Kevin, and explains she has decided he can best be helped if he turns himself in for now, thus killing any trust the boy still had in her. After Kevin is taken into custody, the Hellions decide to spring him. Only the newest member, Icarus, protests and leaves. Hellion asks Wind Dancer to come instead and she agrees.</p><p><strong>Trivia</strong> : This issue features the first appearance of popular new X-men; <a href=\"../../pixie/29-40673/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Pixie</a> and <a href=\"../../loa/29-40672/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Loa</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The battle over the fate of young Kevin Ford turns explosive as the New Mutants go head-to-head with the Hellions! Loyalties betrayed! New alliances formed! And a new romance that doesn’t quite fit under school policy…</em></p><p>Icarus informs the New Mutants about the Hellions’ plan to break out Kevin Ford and adds that Wind Dancer went with them. The team decides to fight the Hellions and Elixir asks Wolfsbane to join them. When she refuses, he asks her to keep quiet about this. The team confronts the Hellions outside the station in Salem Center, moments before the Hellions can free Kevin. The two teams fight and Prodigy confronts Wind Dancer about the leadership issue. They come to terms with it and Sofia rejoins her team. With the added muscle and David’s talent for strategy, they win. In the meantime, Cyclops, Emma and Rahne have arrived, as Rahne did tell the others, while inside the station Dani is distracting the agents. Cyclops takes them back to school commending the New Mutants for trying to stop the other team but chiding them for taking things into their own hands instead of telling the X-Men. Two weeks later, charges are dismissed against Kevin and he is allowed to return to school. However, after witnessing the battle, he feels the Hellions are his true friends and wishes to be reassigned to their team. As a result, Icarus takes the empty spot on the New Mutants team. Surge makes some tentative peace with her roommate, Dust, Prodigy and Wind Dancer decide to be co-leaders and, after Elixir confronts Wolfsbane over betraying the New Mutants, they kiss.</p>",
