    "description": "<p><i>Celebrate the 20Th Anniversary of AC Comics with it's most successful title, Femforce!! As Dr. Mara delves into Synn's diminishing/expanding intellect, fantastic forces snatch the Girl From LSD into the far-flung future where, if you can believeit, \"Synn Saves The Solar System!\" Written and drawn by Bill Black, and guest-starring The Starmasters!!! After sucking soul energy from countless lost beings, the monstrous Kraken awakens and rises from the deep sea depths to ravage the planet. Only Nightveil, sorceress supreme, and She-Cat, feline cat goddess, stand in its path to block its conquest in the cataclysmic climax to \"The Curse of the Kraken\" by Tony Bruno and Scott Nemmers. Also, Eric Coile's masterful \"Cave Girl\", originally scheduled for Cave Girl #2. What if legendary actress/pin-up queen Irish McCalla had played the part of Cave Girl? Plus- an additional 16-page section that includes scads of sexy pin-ups by Ed Coutts, Brad Gorby, Heike &amp; Black, Eddy Newell and others, and the textual account of how Bill Black created Synn and the Femforce, profusely illustrated with art and photos!! Every copy signed by Bill Black and Mark Heike!! As mentioned elsewhere, due to a printing gaff, only a few of these books will be available here as back issues. All of the \"standard edition\" versions of this book, sold through the comics distributors, have sold out and are unavailable. We just had parts to assemble a few of these Special Anniversary Editions, so this is the only version of this book that will now be available- and when these are sold, FF 118 will no longer be available in ANY format. We may someday reprint this material in another format, but that will not be in the foreseeable future-so if you want this book, act now. 60 pages, black and white with color covers, standard comic book format.</i></p>",

A Femforce story out of the past, by new creators Paul Monsky on script, and Ed Coutts on art. Then, an actual vintage Golden Age tale starring Miss Victory, in a never-previously-reprinted Charles Quinlan production, last seen in Holyoke Comics' \"Veribest Sureshot #1, circa 1945. Yankee Girl fills in for Ms. V. at a political meet-and-greet and ends up in hot water in \"Driplomacy\", written by Mark Heike, and illustrated by yet another pair of first-timers, Gianluca Cerrutelli and Silas Dixon. All this, plus Part II of Jason Greenfield's text opus, \"Worlds of Justice: The Nightman Chronicles. Black and white with color covers, 44 pages, standard comic book format.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p><i>The second issue of the three-part \"Superbabes\" trilogy leads of with a 24-page barnburner of a conclusion to last issue's \"Out of The Past\" Femforce lead story, as the circe 1955 team of Miss Victory, She-Cat, Rio Rita, Blue Bulleteer and Blonde Bomber start out as the helpless captives of the villainess Rathschilde. When it becomes obvious that mere super-powers won't defeat their suddenly-savage opponent, brains, bravery and teamwork must save the day. And wait'll you see who was REALLY behind this time-twisted plot all along. Written by Mark &amp; Stephanie Heike, penciled by Jeff Austin, with inks by Mark, Jeff &amp; Steph. Then, the gorgeous gal-character guest-stories continue, with the dark-alley mystery of Femme Noir, written by veteran comics pro Chris Mills, drawn by all-time great Joe Staton, and inked by talented new embellisher Horatio Ottolini. The mysterious blonde distaff detective (and star of Chris Mills' supernaturalcrime.com website) trades pot-shots with gangsters, thugs and various outrageous characters in a stolen-artifact switcheroo called \"The Dingus\". Mauricio Hunt's teen heroine Kinetics ( you may remember her cameos in Femforce #99 &amp; 100 ) gets a feature story of her own, as the pert and perky super-powered alien must defeat an awesome rock monster while \"Going To The Movies\", as illustrated by Adriano Vicente Santos. All this plus pin-ups , too!! Color cover (by Mark &amp; Stephanie Heike) with black &amp; white interoirs, 44 pages, standard comic book size.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Historic 125Th issue! ALL NEW MATERIAL, NOT A SINGLE REPRINT!!!Guest-stars abound as the Femfoce title reaches the one and one-quarter century mark!! First- from out of the past, the supernatural sizzle of the being known as Firebeam!! Among the Femforce regulars, there is nothing but questioning and self-doubt with Ms. Victory, Nightveil and Synn-so leave it to Firebeam to thwart a plot to bring the spirit of the most hated man in world history back to life- without even knowing the villains behind it!! \"Drawn to The Flames\" with story and pencils by Mark Heike, and inks by Jeff Austin. Then, it's back to the fighting 1940's in a retro drama starring She-Cat, aided and abetted by the redoubtable Reddevil, and a surprise appearance by Ms. Scarab. It's \"Night of The Goddess\" , with story and inks by Chris Irving, and pencils by Chris Samnee. Move the clock forward a few decades, to a point just after Tara Fremont finished college, and you'll find her defending her newly-acquired Jungle Island in \"Danger Waits Down Any Path\", written by Paul Monsky, and drawn by Silvano. Then, two star-crossed supernatural entities find each other, when a desparate and forlorn Black Phantom turns to the ebony Darkshade, in \"An Immaterial Love Story\", with art and inks by Chris Irving, and pencils by Reilly Brown. Throw in a two-page recap of Reddevol's origin by Irving and Samnee, and you've got quite an issue. 44 pages, black and white with color covers, standard comic book size.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p><i>ALL-NEW!! NOT A SINGLE PAGE OF REPRINT!! Former FF writer/artist Don Secrease returns with a mysterious revelation involving his own addition to Femforce history, their one-time leader: Colt, the weapons mistress, in: \"Whatever Happened To Shorty?\" The mystery unfolds over the last year, as Femforce members MISS VICTORY, STARDUST, TARA, SHE-CAT, SYNN &amp; NIGHTVEIL take on various old Colt villains; like Montague Moon, Bric-a-Brac, Pinto, Tagg, and more. All easily dispatched, but as the FFers begin to wonder why their diminutive former leader was not available to defeat her old foes, Nightveil goes to the source- and finds a shocking revelation!! Script by Done Secrease, pencils by Secrease, Mark Glidden, Stephanie Sanderson-Heike, Sylvain Varreau, and Jeff Austin, with inks throughout by Mark G. Heike. Then, another Golden Age great is revived at AC as Rulah, the Jungle Queen (one-time bosomy brunette bombshell of Victor Fox's great \"good girl art\" comics of the 1940's) returns in all-new jungle action in \"Clash of the Gods\", written by Enrico Teodorami, with art by Antonio Conversano. See Rulah battle Kutulu, the giant jungle ape. Plus, a pair of Blue Bulleteer \"short subjects\"- \"Night of Countess Hells\", by Teodorani and Conversano, and \"Blue Bulleteer Captured\", written by Teodorani, with art by Luciano Bernasconi. Great glamor and action in the classic tradition featuring the longest-running female super-team in comics history. 44 pages, black &amp; white with color covers. Standard comic book format.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p><i>BIG 20Th ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL!! It's been twenty years of great Femforce fun, action and excitement, and to celebrate, longtime fan favorite Brad Gorby has written this 40-page, book length spectacular all-new, never-before -seen story: \"www.derfuerherdownload.com \"!! Lady Luger and Fritz Voltzmann are back, with a plan to bring their favorite kind of Fascism back to sweep the globe!! And- they've recruited several of their best Aryan buddies to help them pull it off- Valkyra, Ironjaw and-- The Frightenstein Monster?? This blockbuster saga is chock full of guest-stars, like Firebeam, The Scarlet Scorpion and The Justice Squad (Atoman, Carbonator, Lady Darkness, Beamer and Speedbolt- you remember them), and STILL only tells half the story, as this adventure is TOO BIG to be contained in one issue, it will be continued and concluded in FF #131. This epic is told in chapters, with pencil art on each by a different Femforce favorite artist- Scott Nemmers, Ed Coutts, Don Secrease and Gorby HIMSELF each draw a chapter, but Jaunty Jeff Austin is so good, we had to have him draw TWO!! Inks over most of the book are by the team of Mark and Stephanie Heike, with special individual chapters inked by Austin, Coutts, and Bossman Bill Black. All this encasec in a superb wraparound cover drawn by Da Gorbster, and inked and colored by Mark 'n Steph Heike. What more could you want?</i></p>",

    "description": "<p>FFUC#2 The Femforces's alien member, Stardust is in the spotlight this issue, as the upheavil caused by the death of Jason Burke (in Femforce #50 ) leaves her puzzled, coming from a civilization on Rur that discourages the feeling and expressing of emotion in any form. With the help of Nightveil's magic, she quickly takes a trip back to her homeworld, only to find the things she's seen on Earth have her questioning her Rurian upbringing. Back on Earth, her budding relationship with David Burke may lead to more interesting revelations- but neither she nor David have considered the impact of gonzo video journalism!! \"One Slip\" is written by Mark Heike(from an idea by Christie Churms), drawn by Dave Roberts and inked by Jordi Ensign It guest stars Queen Reina and Proxima. Then, Dusty ruminates on her origin and enjoys a solitary celebration of her birthday in \"Stardust Memories\". Story and layouts by Richard(The Count)Rome, and finishes by Mark Heike. (This story originally appeared in Femforce #26) Also, pin-ups by Chris Allen and Greg Horn. Color cover by Mark Heike, (from a design by Rik Levins) full color throughout. Standard comic book format.</p>",

With the D-Fly personna more and more dominant , change is the watchward. Fed up even with her temporary membership in the Femforce, she walks out on that, buys a motorcycle and hits the road.

Taking the misunderstood giant woman to her Jungle Island refuge for safe keeping, Tara hopes that she and her biotechs may figure out a way to shrink the GTS star down to normal size-and in the bargain, help Tara learn to control her own newfound growing powers. When a small cache of malignant energy left on the island by The Black Shroud's occupation some months before causes local wildlife to mutate, the twin towers must fight for their lives. Good girl art, giant cat-fights and all sort of bikini'd size-changing mayhem abound in \"Infestation From Space\", written by Drake Letcher, drawn by Jun Lofamia and Manny Pantaleon, inked by Jun De Filippe, Nar Castro and Sonny Delos Santos. It guest stars Ms. Victory, Madalyne Macabre, Synn, and She-Cat. Plus-Tara pinup by Gorby and Heike. Full color cover by Tom Simonton and Mark Heike, full color throughout. Standard comic book format.</p>",

The evil sorceress Vivarna now holds sway, and Nightveil's mentor fears the worst is yet to come- when that tremendous arcane force turned evil, The Darkshade arrives. Will even Nightveil herself be safe from its foul taint? \"The Devil On Dark Dhagor!\" is written by Bill Black, and illustrated by Black, Dick Ayers and Mark Heike. It features cameos by The Shade, Black Phantom, and Gorgana., and a short text feature on the history of The Shade. Then, Nightveil faces off with the hideous Gorgana in a mystic duel to the finish just outside NV's Everglades haven, in \"Swamp Demon\", written by Steve Ringgenberg, drawn by Mark Heike and inked by Bill Anderson. This is a reprint of a story originally published in Nightveil #1. Color cover by Bill Black and Mark Heike, interiors are black and white with graytones. Standard comic book format.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p> <p>This patriotic-themed issue presents red, white and blue clad heroes of the Golden Age of comics, skillfully reproduced in complete story form, from vintage comics in sharp, clear images. The Flagman and his kid sidekick, Rusty, battle not one but two Axis dictators in Nazi occupied France! Both Hitler and Mussolini guest star! The Eagle and Buddy , the dare-devil boy, fight sabotage at sea when Nazis sink the Navy's secret submarine... the PX-1! Miss Victory (AKA Joan Wayne) pits her prowess and pulchritude against \"The Devils With Wings\" led by Garto, King of the Falcons!! (sexy art by Nina Albright). Even though The Dart, a reincarnation of ancient Roman racket buster Cassius Martius, throws off our color scheme by wearing yellow, red and green, he and Ace, his juvenile partner, struggle against injustice to save a life-giving serum from destruction. The Spy Smasher rounds out the issue, even with his green and red, out-of-scheme costume colors. Believe me, kiddies, these are rare superheroics from Fox Features, Holyoke and Fawcett titles that you will only find in Men of Mystery. Color with black and white colors, 52 pages, standard comic book format.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p> <p>Men of Mystery #34 $6.95 There's something creepy going on in the AC Editorial offices- the superheroes have been usurped by Weird Men of Mystery! Can true love come to an undying monster? Read \"The Beautiful Dead\", perhaps the best of all the Dick Briefer Frankenstein chillers out of Prize Comics. When a voluptuos blonde creates wholesale murder, Dr. Weir and The Purple Claw discover \"The Devil is a Dame\" by Ben Brown, from Stanmore Publications. Can \"The White Spirits\" who menace jungle dwellers be from the Great Beyond? It's up to the mighty Jungle Jo and Lura, his buxom mate to determine in an eerie tale by Wallace Wood and Joe Orlando. One of the most bizarrre heroes in comics history, Fox Features' Stardust the Super Wizard, torn from the pages of Fantastic Comics, makes his first appearance in Men of Mystery this issue. The Claw- black hearted fiend of civilization- kidnaps Army generals only to be thwarted by the unearthly costumed hero, The Ghost, in an early Lev Gleason/New Friday Pubs. story by Bob Wood. This is a truly weird collection of rare Golden Age stories! 52 pages, black and white with color covers, standard comic book format.</p>",

The classic sleuth, Charlie Chan makes his first MOM appearance this issue, as does Bill Ward's outrageous \"good girl art\" icon from Quality Comics, Torchy.

Next comes a real surprise...Miracle Man! No, not THAT Miracle Man, but the costumed hero from the 1950's who clobbers a giant octopus in this story!! The Tomboy makes her first Men of Mystery appearance this issue,as she battles the cold-blooded villain known as Sound Wave!! Then, meet The Panther, an Australian costumed hero from the same era. Some of the most interesting material out of the Golden Age of comics, from publishers like Fawcett, Sterling, Curtis and more- from around the world.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Another stellar collection of the greatest costumed hero stories from the 1940's. This issue's headliners include The Fighting Yank, in \"Fireworks on the Fourth\", wherin a band of criminals tries to steal a vintage document signed by George Washington himself-drawn as a solo effort by Mort Meskin, and Catman and the Kitten in their untitled first meeting with their arch-nemesis, Dr. Macabre. An excellent story featuring some of the weirdest, wildest Bob Fujitani artwork you'll ever want to see! Then, straight out of Champ Comics, The Human Meteor makes his first-ever appearance in Men Of Mystery, as he and sidekick Toby the shoeshine boy stave off a Japanese air attack on San Francisco. Top flight draftsman Bob Powell handles art chores on \"The Deadly Hour\", a Strongman story originally appearing in Strongman #3, the Ajax-Farrel incarnation of The Black Cobra rings in to bust up a spy ring trying to sabotage the test trials of a new tank for the U. S. Defense department, in a tale rendered by Sheena artist Robert H. Webb. Four superb, full-story reprints utilizing the best reproduction techniques available, from comics originally published by Standard/Better/Nedor, Holyoke/Continental, Magazine Enterprises, Worth Pubs, and L.

Then, a MOM newcomer, Quality's National Comics feature, Wonder Boy debuts, as he overturns a submarine to stop Nazi sabatuers. And, Fox Comics Nightbird, not seen anywhere since Green Mask #9, February 1942, comes onto the scene to stop the murderous... Censor!! Fan-favorite Crimebuster gets the nod, as he stops \"The Overconfident Con-Man\", a story written by Charles Biro, and drawn by Norman Maurer, out of Lev Gleason Pubs' Boy Comics. Fiction House is represented by jungle man (from Jungle Comics- where else?) Ka'anga must hunt the blood spoor of the Phantom Queen- tastefully drawn by Maurice Whitman. Finally, it's dark fantasy from Charlton with Steve Ditko's Mysterious Traveler as he views an \"Escape\". Black oand white with color Mac Raboy cover .</em></p>",

Then, Manhunter takes on \"Fence, Incorprated\", as originally seen in Police Comics #66. Two more quality first-timers for the Men of Mystery series appear here, too- as Neon, The Unknown appears, in a story reprinted from Hit Comics #17, (with art by Alex Blum) and The Jester comes on the scene, from a later issue Smash Comics. Fiction House favorites Star Pirate (by Leonard Starr) and Kaanga (drawn by John Celardo) round out the Golden Age fun. Full-story, exact reprints of actual, vintage 1940's comic book stories from the industies' greatest creators.</em></p>",

New to MoM this issue is Ace Comics' top crime crusher, Magno (along with his costumed assistant, Davey) in a tale darawn by the distinctively quirky Rudy Palais, from 1946's Super-Mystery comics Volume 6, #2. Finally, we re-present what is artist Bob Fujitani's strangest superhero strip, with this great 1946 rerun of the one and only appearance of Captain Truth, out of Cambridge House Publishing's Gold Medal Comics #1. Must be seen to be believed!! Brilliant, perfect full-story reprints of actual Golden Age comic book stories from the 1940's.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>An all-star issue made up of some of the biggest stars in superhero comics of the 1940's, in crystal-clear, full-story reprints. Inside of a superb Alex Schomburg cover, you'll find Dollman, facing the unlikely villainy of...Polka-Dot? A wildly expressive strip drawn by the unsung great John Spranger. Then, it's that shambling mass of living matter known as The Heap, in a top-flight retelling of his origin, drawn by Ernie Schroeder. The Black Terror faces off against a colorful female vigilante in \"The Revenge of Red Ann\"; as rendered by Jerry Robinson and Mort Meskin. Then, it's Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, tackling \"The Ghosts of the Lion-Men\", by R. H. Webb and friends. This issue's first-time guest feature is Yankee Doodle Jones, illustrated by Lou Fine imitator (and Lou's brother-in-law, in fact) Charles Sultan. Plus, one-page featurettes from Space Mouse and Atom-Age combat, with art by Frank Carin and Dick Ayers. Great encore presentations of storis that originally appeared in Quality, Standard/Nedor, Fiction House, Harry \"A\" Chesler, Hillman, Charlton and Fago comics.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Another top-flight mix of rare, full-story reprints from the Golden Age of comics this issue, starting out with cover feature Minute Man. In addition to comics, Minute Man's publisher (Fawcett) produced a variety of products that featured their characters- including a series of Dime Action Books- small, illustrated storybooks in a format not too dissimilar from Whitman Pubs hugely -successful Big Little books. The Minute Man Dime Action adventure, \"Mystery of the Spy Ring\", with art by the Harry \"A\" Chesler studio, was among Fawcett's best. Here in MOM, we've taken the Dime Action illustrated book approach, and reformatted the illustrations into comic book panels, layed out horizontally, to tell the story in a manner closer to the standard comic book approach. Minute Man's Fawcett Comics stablemate Bulletman appears this issue, as well- but instead of usual partner Bulletgirl, here he goes into action with a flying canine cohort, in \"Bulletdog Takes Over\". Then, the distaff side of adventuring is represented by Jim Monney and Bob Turner's Wildfire, as she cleans out a castle haunted by thugs in a story straight out of Quality Comic's Smash #33. Next, the one and ONLY appearance of artist Bob Powell's futuristic, flying female, the one and only Atoma!! Fiction House joins the fray, with a well-illustrated (and untitled) Captain Wings tale. Plus- as a special feature, and action-packed effort starring the Original Blue Beetle- \"Last Chance\", with art by Ted Galindo and Ray Osrin.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Big 50Th Issue!!! The\" best of the best \" culled from comic's Golden Age are reprinted as usual this issue, starting out with the legendary Spy Smasher, stranded on a tropical island and at the mercy of Nazi killers in \"Winds of Death\", illustrated by Alex Blum. Then, from Down Under, it's a reprise of Australia's version of The Catman, and his partner Kit, as they must save beautiful Terry West and her father, The Professor, from the clutches of Capital Cities' crimeboss, Vic Stombelli, in a beautifully-illustrated cliffhanger drawn by John Dixon. Look for the conclusion of the story in MoM #51. Then, Bulletman and Bulletgirl save a man from attempted murder on the ski slopes in \"The Death Jump\", with art by Charles Tomsey. Then, counter-espionage takes The Black X into Finland and Russia, in the early days of World War II, in an untitled story drawn by Will Eisner, ortiginally seen in Smash Comics #10. Finally, it's Cold War superheroics as The Avenger flim-flams a coterie of Communists into believing that he is a \"Man From Mars\"; with art by Bob Powell. Top quality printing and reproduction on superb full-story reprints of material originally seen in the 1940's and '50's from publishers like Quality, Magazine Enterprises, and Fawcett.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Another Quality Comics- themed issue, with all stories reprinted from that storied stable of comic characters from the 1940's and '50's. Unheralded Quality artistic great John Spranger is highlighted, with TWO stories in addition to the cover illustration: Dollman faces his arch-foe The Undertaker on a cross-counrty train ride; (as originally seen in Feature Comics) then Manhunter takes on the master mechanic of lawlessness, Jawbone, from Police Comics #60. U.S. government master spy, Pete Trask- better known as T-Man, solves the case of \"The Elephant Who Loved Flowers\"- a tale from his own magazine, drawn by H. G. Hargis; and the glamorous Torchy has an adventure in babysitting, courtesy of artist Bill Ward. But wait- there's more!! As a special bonus, we're running an adventure of The Black Condor, drawn by the artist most associated with \"quality\"- be it the publishing company or the descriptive adjective- the great Lou Fine!! The 'Condor fights electrically-charged kite-men, straight from Smash Comics #6. Plus- last issue, we started a feature-length adventure of Australia's Cat-Man, with a promise to run the concluding chapter this month. Well, too much great Quality stuff went into this ish, so there was no room to run the whole finish to Cat-Man!! So- this issue sprts o two- page teaser, with the end of the story (we promise!!) in Men of Mystery #52!!</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Call off the dogs, it's Cat-Man and Kitten in the spotlight this issue, starting off with a great front-cover reproduction of the cover artwork from the first issue of his original Holyoke Comics series, as rendered by Charles Quinlan. Once inside, you get not one but TWO great Cat-Man features; first, a classic confrontation between the ferocious feline and his arch-nemesis, Dr. Macabre (aided and abetted by two elderly but murderous sisters) from Holyoke's Catman #30, as drawn by the awesomely atmospheric Bob Fujitani. Then, it's the fianal chapter of the Australian Catman and Kit story started back in MOM #50, as the down-under duo try to defeat gangster Vic Stombelli in their own secret hideout. It's beautifully illustrated by John Dixon. Lovely Mysta of the Moon makes an appearance, in a Matt Baker-drawn story entitled \"Revolt On Planet Xanthia\", and Fawcett Comic's Spy Smasher gets more than he bargained for when the masked crusader \"Visits The Dentist\". Not one, but TWO Men of Mystery first-timers appear this issue: the mysterious two-fisted detective from Fiction House Comics known as The Eye, in a gritty noir adventure drawn by Bill Bennilus- AND, a whimsical and wonderous escapade of Quality Comic's Kid Eternity, rendered by an unknown artist attempting to ape the great Mac Raboy !!</em></p>",

It starts Airboy, one of the most successful and longest-running characters to come out of the Golden Age of comics, featured in one of the youthful aviators most-requested (and scariest) adventures: \"Airboy and the Rats!!\" This tale is rendered by one of comicdom's unsung masters, Ernie Schroeder. Then, it's not one but two adventures of Quality Comics' green-clad, sassy and sophisticated female adventuress, Lady Luck; bothe rendered by Klaus Nordling. Fisrt, LL takes on a beautiful but deadly lady executioner called Miss Powerhouse; and in the second, sabotage on a dam leads to circumstances that have the social register believing that Brenda Banks ( Lady Luck's civilian identity ) has been killed. The, it's special feature star, The Green Lama!! The 'Lama may not have been a long-lived strip (tho' he did inspire both a pulp magazine and a radio show in the late 1940's) this issue's GL offering, \"An American Story\" sports top-flight art by Mac Raboy, considered by experts to be among the ten best aertists to come out of the comic book world of the 1940's- and this story features cameo appearances by Raboy himself, and hos actual Spark publications editor of the day, Joseph Greene. Then, there's the masked crimefighter known as... Zippo!! What can you say about this Hillman Pubs., yellow-costumed adventurer who fights atop hydraulic footwheels, except that this strip appears to be drawn by Arturo Cazeneuve. Finally, a humorous Jack Cole gem, an adventure with Plastic Man's pal, Woozy Winks!!</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><i>A big, thick book of vintage Golden Age reprints of the best in science fiction comics. Leading off another Reed Crandall “Interplanetary Police” story from the Buster Brown shoe store giveaway comics, this one entitled “Mirror Of Doom”, inked by Ray Willner, again co-starring the villainess, The Space Siren.Then, it’s Steve Ditko sci-fi with “The Planet That Vanished”, and “I Was Captured By The Abominable Snowman”. No G. A. s-f comic would be complete without something from Fiction House Comic’s Planet, and this volume has no less than SEVEN full story reprints from the run of that venerable comic. Unfortunately, like most Fiction House stories, they are untitled, but this issue includes: Mysta Of The Moon, by Chuck Winter, Auro, Lord Of Jupiter, by George Evans, Gale Allen, by Fran Hopper, Auro again, this time drawn by Graham Ingels, Futura, Star Pirate by Leonard Starr, and “The Martian Plague”, illustrated by Mike Sekowsky and Bernard Sachs. More ouiter space fun than you can shake a retrorocket at!! 76 pages, color painted cover, interiors are black and white with graytones. Standard comic book format.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p>It's time to decide Iphigenia's fate. Agamemnon, still torn over the goddess's demand that he sacrifice his daughter, seeks advice from Nestor and hears a story about Herakles's atrocities. Achilles turns to the army to support the girl, but finds that the final answer comes from Iphigenia herself.</p><p>The traditional legends of Troy provide two versions of the outcome--in one she lives, in the other she dies. Here, for your reading pleasure, is the definitive Age of Bronze version.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Strangers meet together to discuss the issues arising with Pilgrim, an ultra who is intent on destroying the Strangers. Lady Killer then holds a fashion show, unveiling her new line of clothes that are inspired by the Strangers. While at the fashion show, Rafferty arrives to kill an ultra. His victim is Elena LaBrava herself and when he attempts to murder her, he is stopped by Spectral. Rafferty gets an opportunity to escape, knowing he can't take on all of the Strangers, and is able to kill an elderly woman who was on the cable car during the Jumpstart, making her an ultra. Soon after the murder, Pilgrim and Byter arrive to recruit Rafferty, but Rafferty is the first to refuse him. While Rafferty and Pilgrim fight, Atom Bob jumps in and fights Pilgrim. Byter bites Atom Bob, providing a distraction for them to escape.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Lady Killer and Yrial decide to take Atom Bob to Europe so they can find a cure for his mental instability. Meanwhile, the other Strangers stay behind to figure things out. ElectroCute tells everyone they should take a long drive together and she rushes to get the car. As soon as she starts it, the car explodes. ElectroCute is in bad shape and her android body cannot heal itself in its current shape. Realizing the only one that could save her is J.D. Hunt, the Strangers make moves to hold J.D. Hunt while his scientist, Waddell, fixes ElectroCute. Waddell does his job and ElectroCute's body is healed. However, she immediately attacks her teammates and it seems that Waddell was able to reprogram her during the healing process.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Strangers all meet together and exchange stories, how Yrial and Lady Killer met an ultra named Taboo in Europe and how the others had to fight ElectroCute who was temporarily reprogrammed by J.D. Hunt's company. Meanwhile Paul Ntumbo, also known as Taboo, learns about the Strangers on his flight to America. He also learns about their first foes, TNTNT, and it sparks an interest in him to meet them. Taboo finds TNTNT and propositions them to destroy the Strangers, to which they agree. Taboo then takes the place of Torso, who was killed by Rafferty. TNTNT attacks the Strangers at their headquarters and the battle quickly escalates. TNTNT is defeated but they escape, leaving the Strangers to celebrate their victory.</p><p><i>This is the last issue of The Strangers</i></p>",

However, it seems that what his father really wants is the invisibility serum that Invisible Kid has created for the Science Police to use. When Invisible Kid informs <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\" href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" slug=\"brainiac-5\">Brainiac 5</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1264\" href=\"/cosmic-boy/4005-1264/\" slug=\"cosmic-boy\">Cosmic Boy</a> that his father is a Science Police Chief, they feel utterly betrayed. To make things right, Invisible Kid goes to his father with a sample of his blood, since he injected the serum. His father accepts the serum and mentions how he wants his son back, but that's all the Invisible Kid is willing to give. The serum actually held a computer virus that allowed the Legion of Super-Heroes to enter the Science Police databanks. The serum itself was stolen by a man named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1268\" href=\"/lemnos/4005-1268/\" slug=\"lemnos\">Praetor Lemnos</a>.</p>",
