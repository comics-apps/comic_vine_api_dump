    "description": "<p><i>To end his immortal suffering, he must slay one thousand enemies! Manji, a ronin warrior of feudal Japan, has been cursed with immortality. To rid himself of this curse, to regain his mortality, and to end his life of misery, he must slay one thousand evil men! His quest begins when a young girl seeks his help in taking revenge on her parents' killers . . . and his quest won't end until the blood of a thousand has spilled!</i></p><p><b>General Notes</b></p><p>Dana Lewis and Toren Smith's writing credits are as translators of Samura's original Japanese and Wayne Truman's lettering credit is for retouching, although some of Hiroaki's original lettering (such as sound effects, is left in tact).</p><p>Despite the solicit, the issue is actually not about those specific events and rather the solicit is an overview of the initial premise of the series. The young girl (Rin Asano) doesn't appear in this issue and her parents aren't even killed until the arc following this prologue to the series.</p>",

Except their days and nights of torture have given Giichi time to track them down. The bespectacled killer with the decapitating head-cuff is hot on their trail, and hungry to take out a few more Itto-ryu bad guys. They don't know it yet, but there' s going to be hell to pay. Lot's of \"killer\" characters are coming back to Blade, as grudge matches galore line up for continuous bloody swordplay.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Diana learns the secret of the Egyptian Amazons, while the Cheetah doesn't cope well with captivity.</em></p><p>The battle from the issue #32 is over and Wonder Woman is on a horse. Nehebka asks if Wonder Woman is alright. Even though they have survived a massacre, Wonder Woman asks if this is justified. They were only after Cheetah yet so many innocents died. Wonder Woman tells the Bana-Mighdall Amazons that perhaps this is the work of butches, not warriors. If she had only gotten here earlier. Her medicine was inadequate and she was too weak to pray to the Gods to help her. She then asks why the did not kill when they had the chance. Nehebka replies that the queen's last wish was to <em>not</em> kill her.</p><p>Meanwhile in a small shop police are investigating a crime scene. A man is dead while a woman tells them that a \"she-demon\" has killed him. One of the officers find a torn up photo of Wonder Woman and the woman tells them that she was the woman who had killed Cheetah and ended the bloodshed.</p><p>Back at Bana-Mighdall, Cheetah is imprisoned in a padded cell. Wonder Woman looks down at her and Cheetah is still in her barbaric state. Wonder Woman remembers Chuma telling her that Cheetah should return to her normal state by dawn, but it had been hours before that and she is still in her Cheetah form. Wonder Woman asks for forgiveness as she never meant to be so violent seeing as she was someone who represented peace. Then, an Amazon wearing an eye-patch walks in and she introduces herself in Faruka, in English. She introduces herself as Faruka, the one who called Julia and the former assistant to the chief priest – who Diana murdered. Wonder Woman tries to explain that she died from an accident, but Faruka isn't having any of it.</p><p>Wonder Woman says that she has been referred to \"Ariadna\" ever since and says that it sounds familiar but she does not know what it means. Cheetah rants back to Faruka, and she replies by pulling out a revolver but Wonder Woman grabs her arm from doing so. Queen Anahid had ordered Wonder Woman to be kept alive only so she could be killed by Faruka. She still thinks that the sacrilege is not resolved! Wonder Woman snaps back lecturing her about Bana-Mighdall society itself. She assures Faruka that Barbara Minerva will be punished, but not by them! She must do so – to honour a man named Chuma.</p><p>In a town called Bahafara, a man is driving Dr. Osman Suakin to the police station. His friend who is driving can't understand why he is helping an American. He replies that Professor Kapatelis had helped him understand the world much better. He is then greeted by Hussain and his men and fills Osman in on what has happened. Apparently, there have been many \"she-devils\". Hassain explains that at first he did not believe the people who have been claiming this but after they found dead bodies of women, naked and beheaded, they started believing. Osman then asks about the torn photograph and Hassain asks if he knows who that woman is standing next to Wonder Woman. Osman replies that he does, and that is why the reason why he is here.</p><p>Osman, in his hotel room, calls Julia Kapatelis and tells her about the dead bodies. Julia asks if one of the bodies is Wonder Woman, but Osman replies that they are all dark-skinned He also mentions a pygmy who was killed but eaten by vultures – it makes it hard to identify the body. However, Julia knows who it is - Chuma. Vanessa is upstairs, listening in on the conversation through the other phone. Julia tells Osman that she is on the next flight to Cairo. She tells Vanessa that a neighbour will be over taking care of her.</p><p>Back at Bana-Mighdall inside a temple, and Diana notices a strange glow. She walks towards the Girdle of Gaea, and as she does, her lasso glows along with it. Wonder Woman unhooks her lasso's and the girdle's energy combine. Just then, the temple starts shaking. Faruka tells Wonder Woman to step away but she is too transfixed. Not listening to Faruka, she tackles Wonder Woman but the energy surrounding her bounces her back. Guards rush in, ready to tackle Wonder Woman but Nehebka orders them to separate Wonder Woman from the girdle. She then shows Wonder Woman a pile of books and she understands the language that is used here, even though Nehebka does not. Diana reads it, and it seems as if Diana was not the priestess' murderer, but rightful executioner. Faruka however, is unconvinced.</p><p>Nehebka then starts recounting the Bana-Mighdalls' origin story. It was about three millennia ago when a sword fight had happened between King Theseus and an Amazon girl called Phthia. The king's son, Melanippus, and the Captain warned Theseus about this young girl. Melanippus asks what happened and before he can reply, Phthia yells that Theseus is a murderer and he points to the Queen's bedroom. Melanippus was born to a previous spouse, and she had never approved of the current one. Inside was Antiope's body, dead, with a dagger in her heart. The king says that he saw a shadowed body running from the room and does not know if it is Phthia's or not. He was so affected by the murder of Antiope that he did not hear the nurse's screams. Phthia was standing over his infant child looking like she was going to kill the child.</p><p>Phthia says that she was only shielding the baby, and that it had been Theseus of murdered Antiope. He killed her because she learned of his affair with Phaedra. Theseus tries to reason with her but she is not listening and tells him that he was always jealous of Antiope's power. He also wanted to kill Hyppolytus, the child, to end her blood line. Perhaps Melanippus had been right about her all along. Melanippus sent Phthia into the deepest and darkest of jails where she was tortured and Melanippus hopes to finish her off, by executing her. He requests permission to have her executed, but the king argues that Antiope was like a mother towards Phthia and there's no way she could've killed her. Melanippus bounces back saying that Phthia had always blamed men for her mother's death and everything under the sun.</p><p>Theseus hoped to find someone to blame and chose Ariadna, his former wife who he had banished from the kingdom, hoping to marry Antiope.</p><p>Wonder Woman then interrupts the story, saying hat she mentioned Diana's aunty. Faruka says that Diana could not possibly be an Amazon as she is too young, and as she has read from the ancient writings, Queen Hippolyta and her Amazons had been swallowed by the sea. Faruka continues, saying that the Tournament of the Crown will only show who can be Anahid's replacement. Wonder Woman apologises as Nehebka continues with the story.</p><p>Ariadna is found guilty to Antiope's murder and even Phthia's, though many questions raised suspicion, such as how she escaped from her exile and where Phthia's body had disappeared to. During the night when Ariadna was to be executed, the Amazons raided the kingdom, freeing her and from that day on, they knew there would never be peace between Man and Amazon. So from there on, Ariadna's name has meant \"Evil Intruder\" or \"One who must not be trusted\".</p><p>Later on, during the Trojan Wars, an Amazon captain called Penthiselea, who was Phthia's daughter, fought against Captain Eteocles who was Melanippus' son. Penthiselea killed him, and never had revenge tasted so sweet. Wonder Woman disagrees however stating that war is not glorious and that her glory was short-lived. Nehebka acknowledges what Diana says, but they had profited from it. Amazons were the best at battling and they became mercenaries, fighting alongside anyone who offered the right price. They also developed weapons during the time of modernisation and developed the Cobra-dart.</p><p>Meanwhile, the temple shakes again and Nehebka says that it is probably a mystic sandstorm and its coming towards the city. Pointing out from a window, Nehebka spots a light in the middle of the storm. Wonder Woman takes a look herself and is shocked by who it is. It is Hermes, acting how a god <em>shouldn't</em> be acting. He comes in with a booming voice, saying he has come to extract the betrayers of the Amazons.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Hermes joins Diana in retrieving the second golden girdle of Gaea, Steve Trevor and Julia Kapatelis arrive in Egypt, and Diana faces Shim'Tar, the new Queen of Bana-Mighdall.</em></p><p>Hermes comes and blasts the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall with his energy blasts while they fight back with their modern day weapons. Hermes is soon hit with a bullet and he falls. Wonder Woman places herself between Hermes and the Amazons and they then lower their weapons, to fulfil the wishes of the dead queen. Hermes then says he is here to retrieve the Golden Girdle of Gaea.</p><p>Meanwhile in a temple, Faruka is holding something with a cloth wrapped around it, and mentions something about the New Order finally taking over and that this item was crucial in the plot of Queen Anahid’s death. Faruka then opens the cloth and the item glows. She is met by two Amazons and requests them to take her to the one who waits.</p><p>Somewhere else in an airfield, Steve Trevor and Julia Kapatelis touch down and are greeted by Dr. Osman Saukin with General Masat. Julia explains that she is here because she is worried of the welfare of Wonder Woman. The four of them plan how to find Wonder Woman and General Masat asks how they will manage to prevent the loss of innocent lives. Steve replies by finding the whereabouts of the people who murdered the villagers of Syene Kesh and he presents a miniature Caduceus.</p><p>Back at the city of Bana-Mighdall, Wonder Woman and Nehebka argue whether to relinquish the Girdle as requested by Hermes. Nehebka refuses and says that Wonder Woman is pushing this too far. Wonder Woman replies that she has explained its history and belongs to Hippolyta. Nebekha explains that if that is the case, then Wonder Woman should give them back the lasso because it was forged from the Girdle, but she will not give it back simply because they asked her.</p><p>Not far away, a helicopter flies near the city and uses the Caduceus to help find Wonder Woman. Masat then spots something with his binoculars. The helicopter lands and Masat finds a body of a rebel fanatic named Colonel Hadal and wonders why they were out here in the desert. Masat then claims that this is now military business, and if the Amazon butchers are inside that storm, there is only one way to end this – by bombing it. Julia to her horror pleads him not to do so as Wonder Woman is still inside.</p><p>Wonder Woman and Hermes look down at Cheetah in the infirmary and she explains that if she had killed Cheetah, she would just become Cheetah herself and would be no better.</p><p>Meanwhile, in one of the city’s mosques Faruka addresses a group, telling them that Hermes is just another one of Anahid’s accomplices. One Amazons interrupts saying that if it wasn’t for Wonder Woman, Hermes could have destroyed them all, but a furious Faruka replies that since Anahid is dead, it is time for the New Order. Nehebka then enters the room and challenges her. Faruka gladly accepts, but she explains that she is merely a herald, and Nehebka’s challenge is behind her.</p><p>Hermes finds that his powers are not working and Wonder Woman suggests that is the Amazons having an effect on him. He tells her that he must retrieve the Girdle. Suddenly, he falls to his knees and says that it is a pain he has never felt before. Hermes tells her that is a job for an Olympian. Wonder Woman rushes after him with Cheetah in her arms. She seems him enter a building, and an Amazon called Batiri warns Wonder Woman not to enter. Then, Hermes is thrown back out by something inside.</p><p>Wonder Woman then hears the voice of Faruka and accepts the challenge the Faruka has presented to her. She then sees something thrown at her and uses her bracelets to deflect it. She then sees that it is the head of Nehebka. Faruka then introduces her new warrior; someone has a tiara like Wonder Woman - Shim'Tar!</p><p>Shim'Tar charges at Wonder Woman and her tiara blinds Wonder Woman which allows Shim’Tar the first punch. As Shim'Tar throws her punches towards Wonder Woman, she remembers something that Hermes had said: “…never felt such force before...not from anything mortal!” Wonder Woman then springs into action but Shim’Tar fights back and kicks Wonder Woman into a nearby tower.</p><p>Meanwhile, three jet fighters struggle in the sandstorm, when it seems to change direction.</p><p>Back in the city, Shim’Tar manages keep on beating Wonder Woman. Hermes, down below asks Batiri to take him to the Girdle. She agrees and takes him there, but is surprised to find that it has been removed. Suddenly, roars hits the city and an Amazon points upwards to find that there are fighter jets flying above the city. Julia is worried for Diana and Hermes but Steve assures that the planes might be able to spot them down below. Masat disagrees, as they have already been given orders – to blow the city apart!</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Hermes tries to adjust to life on man's world, while Diana faces discord among her Amazon sisters on Themyscira.</em></p><p>As the Amazons prepare for the Feast of the Five, they discuss the possibilities of outsiders joining them and Hermes loses his godly powers.</p><p>Hermes stands naked on top of Steve's apartment when a dove from Themyscira and the dove updates him on the Feast of the Five. Steve appears and is shocked to see his naked state and asks him to wear a bathrobe and where the dove has come from. Hermes explains that it has a brought a message from Princess diana. Using his powers, he allows for Steve to hear the message and the both of them listen to Diana's recount of recent events...</p><p>The Amazons are preparing for the event and Hippolyta tells Diana that she has put her in an awkward position. As the Amazons are sheltered from the horrors of the outside world, Hippolyta also understands Diana's opinion, who wishes to extend their culture to the outside world which rejected them in the first place.</p><p>Ipthime questions Diana's seriousness – she cannot be serious that she wishes for outsiders to attend the festival. Hippolyta replies that they have allowed men on the island, so why is this any different? Hellene responds that they should wait before allowing others to come. However, Diana reminds her that she had given Diana a chance. She asks whether the Amazons are to be left in yesterday's tragedies, or they can be the Amazons they are and spread their message of love and humanity to the outside world.</p><p>Ipthime replies and says that it appears Diana is a woman of Sparta, wanting the Amazons to go forth into the world with their swords or on them. Diana says that Ipthime twists her words. She responds, urging Diana to think about how the Amazons have not changed for a long time. Can Diana say that the outside world has?</p><p>In Massachusetts, Hermes explains that the rest of the message contains instructions on guiding the United Nation's representative to Themyscira for the Feast of the Five. But Hermes knows there is something more.</p><p>In Harvard University, Julia Kapatelis is reading in the library when Mr. Vicks enters with a letter in his hand. She opens it and is overjoyed by what it contains and rushes out of the room.</p><p>Back on Themyscira, Menalippe tosses and turns in her sleep. Penelope places her hand on Menalippe and urges her to wake up. Then, a charge of energy comes from Menalippe and knocks Penelope unconscious. Upon hearing the noise, Philippus and Euboea dash into the temple. Diana also appears and they find Menalippe next to Penelope and tells them she found her like this after waking up from her meditations. Euboea checks on Penelope. Diana asks Menalippe what she knows of this but Menalippe doesn't know that much. She then asks Diana if the outside world has tainted her trust for the Amazons and suggests that she flies Penelope to the Isle of Healing straight away. As she flying towards the island she wonders why Menalippe was so calm when her friend had been injured. Or maybe she was correct; maybe she was losing her trust in the Amazons. She then sees a dove approaching...</p><p>In Boston, Vanessa Kapatelis and her friend Lucy Spears have finished their English exams and Vanessa dreads that she will not pass her Geometry exam. Lucy asks if Vanessa has asked Diana for help. Vanessa replies that she didn't want to, as she had troubles in Egypt and she had to prepare for the Feast of the Five. It would just seem unfair to unload her problems on her. They say goodbye to each other and Vanessa makes her way to her mother. She then spots Eileen Flowers talking to some scruffy looking man. She calls out to Eileen and her friend gives a cold response. Vanessa just wanted to check if everything was okay and that they were waiting to take her home. Eileen asks coldly whether by \"they\", Vanesses was reffering to her and her new friend, Lucy.</p><p>The man then introduces himself as Mike Flowers, Eileen's flower. Vanessa reacts to his appearance and smell and Mike apologises for this and explains that he is the janitor and the incinerator has been broken and has been surrounded by garbage. Vanessa hears her mother call her from the waiting car and she waves goodbye. Mike and Eileen watch Vanessa get into the car and Mike comments on Vanessa, saying that she seems \"kinda flighty\" and Eileen nods in agreement.</p><p>Meanwhile in Themyscira, Wonder Woman makes her way through the storms and lighting and makes her way to Steve's apartment. She asks why there is a hole in the apartment wall and Steve reminds Diana about living with a god. Diana realises that he is talking about Hermes and explains he is not destructive by nature. Steve agrees and explains what has happened. That morning when Hermes received the message, he became pensive. Steve asked him what was wrong and Hermes finally broke down and explained that Hermes was worried about his essence. Steve then understood what he meant as the Caduceus was not as bright as it used to be. Hermes then shot through the roof and he felt that Hermes was perhaps feeling left out. As the God of Messengers, he should be able to pass through its realities but it appears as if the Fates have decreed that this is longer his gift Hermes needed someone to talk to and that is why Steve had sent the messenger back to Themyscira. Only Diana can help him.</p><p>In Beacon Hill, Julia explains to Vanessa that the National Geographics Society has agreed to fund her and this means that they are interested in Julia's theory on the location of the original Themyscira. However, Vanessa seems distracted. Julia wonders if she doesn't want to accompany her and wonders who will take care of Vanessa if she doesn't want to go?</p><p>As they enter the house, Vanessa empties the mail box and is excited because she has been accepted to Camp Monroe and urgently tells Lucy over the phone. Julia then realises that Vanessa has sorted out where she is going to stay while she is away.</p><p>In New Hampshire, Wonder Woman flies searching for Hermes and wonders if he does suffer from maelvolence and there is only one place he would take refuge – his Temple. As she approaches, she sees that it is in ruins with Hermes sitting on the rubble. She watches him as she holds his Caduceus, requesting that his power be returned. He shouts, \"Restore me!\" and energy arcs come from his staff. Wonder Woman prays that his wish is granted but there is an explosion of energy and Hermes is thrown backwards.</p><p>Wonder Woman asks if Hermes is okay, but he lashes out at her, throwing her back. She cannot bear to see Hermes like this so she unhooks her lasso and loops coils around Hermes in order to reveal his true self.</p><p>He stops his rampage and she then hears words of adoration and realises that Julia had been correct all along – that he had feelings for her. She then orders Hermes to release the demons in him and he murmurs, \"Yes\" and he then falls to the ground. He tells her that she can remove the lasso. Hermes replies that Gaea is selfish with her gifts, as the lasso can be corrupted only once and Barbara Minerva had already used that oppurtunity. He adds that there is nothing sadder in the universe than a fallen god. Diana tells him that he is <i>not</i> a fallen god. He nods and says that he promised to transport the dignitaries for them to attend the festival. He then asks Wonder Woman for her tiara. He uses it to cut himself and Diana is shocked to see blood coming from the wound. He adds that mortals cannot cross the void which is why he was going to guide them. But he can't anymore because he is just as mortal!</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Hermes bestows a gift upon Diana. Plus, delegates from man's world arrive on Paradise Island.</em></p><p>The twelve delegates make their way to Paradise Island. Little do they know that a plan is being hatched...</p><p>News reporters are about to visit Themyscira and a news reporter is informing people about it. She reports how Diana is about to forge past and present into the future and allow outsiders to visit her homeland. Asmund Lindel announced eleven of the twelve delegates to visit Themyscira and the other ten were hand picked by Wonder Woman and Julia Kapatelis. The people chosen were Maritza Nitumbe, Phyllis Haller, Vladimir Morakov, Robert Cantwell, Rabbi Benjamin Hecht, The Reverend Alan Witherspoon, Lin Koo Teng, Rovo Quashi, Henri Claude Tibet and Felix Zumac.</p><p>The reporter adds that the twelfth delegate is a rumour and only Wonder Woman knows. The reporter sends back to the news HQ and continues that they were supposed to be transported by Hermes, but he is no where to be seen. Then it cuts to the Kapatelis home where reporters are asking questions to Julia.</p><p>Meanwhile at the ruins of Hermes’ temple, Hermes tells Wonder Woman that he has reduced his Caduceus to six inches and that he has enhanced winged sandals that he had given her to take the delegates to Themyscira herself. He then fires a blast of energy to her belt and passes some of his power over to her and sees how the Caduceus now forms a part of her belt. She tells him that she can’t accept this gift; it’s blasphemy. Hermes replies that it’s not blasphemy to accept a gift from a God. He then bids her farewell and flies to Steve’s apartment to clear up the mess while Wonder Woman sets off in a opposite direction.</p><p>She heads towards Metropolis and swoops down to the Daily Planet office and sees Superman waiting for her. Up in the sky, they embrace and the people below woo for them and Superman suggests they go somewhere more private. As they fly out towards the countryside, Superman apologises about the public and apologises for the innuendo that annoys Wonder Woman. She replies that Themis finds it offensive and Superman asks who Themis is. She replies that she is the Guardian of the Social Contract between all beings. Her duty is to remind one another with courtesy and respect. Wonder Woman adds that Superman should come to Themyscira as “Clark Kent”. He replies that he cannot attend the Festival of the Five because of his double life but he has another reporter to replace him…</p><p>Later in Boston, Vanessa is speaking to Eileen flowers on the phone and tells her that Lois Lane will be the final delegate. Vanessa goes on to explain that they are the best of friends and that she has not been ignoring her. She also adds how she can’t understand why Eileen is so jealous of Lucy Spears. Vanessa says that she was hanging out with Lucy Spears in hopes of getting good marks so she can go to camp with Lucy instead of Turkey.</p><p>Eileen suggests that if she does not do well, she can always stay with <em>her</em>, but Vanessa replies that she does not want to stay in boring Boston. Just then, Eileen sees Wonder Woman on TV. Vanessa tells Eileen that Julia had been acting so differently ever since she had got her grant and all she ever talks about is her dig in Turkey. Just then, she is interrupted by her mother who waves an envelope in her hand. She tells Vanessa it’s from Mr. Westlake. Vanessa opens her exams and jumps for joy. Eileen realises that her friend will be spending her time with Lucy.</p><p>At the United Nations, Wonder Woman addresses the audience and speaks in her native tongue. Hermes translates for her. Wonder Woman explains that she came from a world hidden by mist for a long time, known only to them by the songs of Homer and by the philosophies of ancient men. She continues on about her time on Paradise Island, as a child who would always bruise her knees and it was them who had taken care of her wounds. Some have called her a feminist, a chauvinist, a Messiah and a few have called her a Goddess. But she rejects these titles, as she is none of these; only a humanist. Hellenic tradition says that there have been four Ages of Humanity, but now it’s time for a fifth, where they all help each other. Wonder Woman then loops her lasso around the twelve delegates and the Caduceus symbol on her belt begins to glow and soon surrounds everyone. Instantly, they are gone.</p><p>Meanwhile on Paradise Island, the Amazons are waiting for Wonder Woman’s arrival. Hellene comments that Diana is late, that the honourable delegates have probably changed their minds. Perhaps the Princess is too ashamed. Queen Hippolyta orders Hellene to be quiet, that everyone had voted a majority for this day to happen. Pythia calms the both of them down, telling that them that they are simply nervous.</p><p>In the city, Menalippe instructs her Amazon sisters to carry their baskets of golden apples and orders them to be spread out evenly as she does not want them bruised.</p><p>Back in the forest, Hippolyta is surprised on Menalippe’s whereabouts as she knows that the Oracle and Penelope are devoted to each other. Why is she not at her friend’s side? Hippolyta then instructs Philippus to send a messenger to check on Penelope’s condition. An Amazon called Niobe goes to the Temple of Healing to check on her, and one of the healers replies that it is strange that she is in such a deep sleep. Suddenly, Penelope sits up asking where Menalippe is. The surprised Amazons reply that she is helping up setting up the feast. Penelope climbs out of bed, asking why they have been letting her sleep when there is work to be done, but one of the healers grabs her arm and tells her that Epione, another healer, will not allow Penelope to go unless she sees fit. Niobe tells Penelope that she has been sick. Penelope then stares deeply into Niobe’s eyes and asks her if she looks sick. Niobe, transfixed, suddenly agrees that she has recovered. Penelope then tells them that they must not be late.</p><p>In the forest, the Amazons see a glowing orb in the sky and it comes down. The Amazons see Wonder Woman guiding the sphere with her lasso and as it touches down, it disappears and out comes the twelve delegates. The delegates are so surprised by the new environment and Queen Hippolyta steps forward with other Amazons, saluting and welcoming their new guests. Hippolyta then summons a chariot so Henri Claude Tibet can be carried into the city. Lois Lane finds this strange, as this is a race of perfect humans, secluded from the world for 3000 years seems fascinated by physical liabilities. Wonder Woman tells the delegates that it’s ten kilometres to the city and they make their way through the forest.</p><p>When the delegates finally make their way to the streets of Themyscira, they are met by many Amazons. Each of the delegates marvels at the sights surrounding them. Lois Lane goes crazy with the camera, taking almost everything in. High on a balcony, Menalippe, Penelope and Niobe watch and listen down below. Menalippe asks Penelope if she has recovered. She replies that “recovered” is not the right word. Menalippe asks what Penelope sees. She replies that she sees what exactly what Hippolyta and Diana want them to see… the Dawn of a New Age.</p><p>Elsewhere in an unknown location, their words come from a glowing applie held by Eris, the daughter of Ares. She has watched everything and realises that everything is going well according to her plan. She watches the unsuspecting image of Diana, Hippolyta and their guests.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Delegates from man's world experience the wonders of Themyscira, while Eris, Ares' daughter, lays a trap for the Amazon Princess.</em></p><p>Ares' daughter, Eris, is causing trouble for the Amazons.</p><p>The delegates are at an amphitheatre and watch a play about the origins of the Amazons. Amazons emerge from the centre of the arena, re-creating the time when the Goddesses created the Amazons. The play continues, showing how Hippolyta and Antiope were chosen as queens and given the Girdles. Together, they partnered with men and were taken over. Gaea renewed her spirit and called the Amazons to arms. They fought and once the war was over, Hippolyta wanted a peaceful existence while Antiope had bid farewell. Hippolyta led her group to a new island towards the Aegean Sea and Poseidon answered their prayers and parted the sea for them. It was a difficult journey as they feared the water would crash upon them. They finally reached the soils of Paradise Island and every Amazon had the gift of immortality. They then set a new task of building their new home, called Themyscira.</p><p>Menalippe comes to her conclusion of the play and Diana wonders why the oracle sounds so bored in her delivery. Even Lois Lane finds it strange and notices that Diana is embarrassed by such a delivery. As the play ends, Eris watches the events from her magical apple. After the play, Lois makes entries in her journal, describing how the Amazons are finalizing their preparations for the banquet. An Amazon named Clio points out the Golden Apples, neatly set out. Penelope points out that Menalippe should be thanked for that. Just before the banquet, the delegates are invited to mingling. Diana guides them. Felix Zumac wonders about the Garden of Eden and Maritza Nitumbe comments on the richness of the soil. Elsewhere in the library, Phyllis Haller, Alan Witherspoon, Robert Cantwell and Lois Lane are shown by Mnemosyne and the books that are available to read. Cantwell wonders about inbreeding and Phyllis Haller interjects, telling Mnemosyne to ignore him as they are just typical men. Lois continues writing in her journal, explaining what Amazons do when they need medical attention. She writes in her book about a small islet where healing is performed, and Dr. Vladimir Morakov is studying herbology in exchange for modern medical knowledge.</p><p>Back in the capital city, Asmund Lindel comments on the Chaos Wall around the island and asks whether Hippolyta has heard of the Iron Curtain or not, because the Chaos Wall resembles the Iron Curtain. Hippolyta replies that she doesn’t rule with terror. Lindel suggests that they remove it before Hippolyta makes her visit to New York. Hippolyta responds that the Chaos Wall is needed for defense and can be removed by the Gods if necessary.</p><p>Elsewhere, Henri Claude Tibet is being wheeled by an Amazon named Timandra, and Tibet asks about the architecture. Timandra replies that even thought she is an architect, her expertise is in the design of buildings. Themyscira’s city planner died defending Doom’s Doorway.</p><p>At the site of Doom’s Doorway, Hellene and Lin Koo Teng survey the statue commemorating those who died defending the doorway. Lin Koo Teng tells of a similar story, where her friends died defending Tiananmen Square and Hellene tells her that she shouldn’t be so bitter; it will drag her down and that she should forgive. Menalippe appears and points out that without death, there is no life. Hellene and Teng continue the tour and Menalippe says she will catch up with them as she looks up at the statue.</p><p>In the city, Diana, Lois and other few Amazons watch Rovo Quashi play the lyre and is asked if he has ever played it before. Quashi replies that he hasn’t. Diana and Lois leave the Amazons and Quashi and Lois takes this opportunity to interview Diana. The both of them talk about her views on peace, despite her baser aspects of human nature. They also talk about Myndi Mayer and her friendship with Julia and Vanessa Kapatelis. And finally, Superman. Lois had expected Diana to choke at the question, though Diana had smiled and asked her about Superman. Rabbi Hecht is then seen running out of the temple and rants about the Amazon’s beliefs regarding religion. Diana is furious at the thought of an outsider disrespecting their religion. Penelope explains to Diana that they do not want outsiders tainting their faith with other religions. Diana asks the rabbi to calm down, but only if Penelope apologises, however, it is unsuccessful. Lois then sees the opportunity for a big story. She now knows that the illusion of peace <em>is</em> in fact an illusion and if she could communicate with the outside world to tell people about this, she could, though a part of her is glad that she can’t. Diana then finds Menalippe and flies towards the Doom’s Doorway and down below, Hellene and Lin Koo see Diana fly, suggesting that they follow her. However, Hellene says that the feast will begin soon and will need to go back to the city.</p><p>Diana then reaches Menalippe and calls for her. She then hears a noise and finds that the statute has ripped off. She then hears Menalippe’s cries from a void below and Diana attempts to open the void some more to save her sister. She herself can’t move it open and wonders how Menalippe had done so in the first place. Diana does manage to pull apart the void and calls for Menalippe. The ground below her then disappears and she is kept up by strong winds. She then sees a light and Menalippe’s voice tells her that this is the way to freedom. Diana flies towards it to find a serpent which attacks her. She dodges it, but other heads of the serpent attack her as well. She is grabbed by one and it squeezes her until she cuts the serpent’s throat with her tiara. But the attack on causes an eruption of flames from the wound and her tiara is shot out of Diana’s hand. Twigs then tie around her ankle and wrists and she sees her skin turning into wood. She then sees Menalippe is standing beside Eris, Ares’ daughter. Menalippe tells Diana that their fate is with Ares. Diana turns completely into wood and everything goes black.</p><p>Night begins to show itself and the banquet has almost begun. Hippolyta wonders where her daughter and the oracle are. Of all people, how can it be them that are late? Lois replies that they are just being fashionably late, but Hippolyta replies that Menalippe cannot be late because without her, they cannot begin. Lin Koo tells Hellene that perhaps they should have followed Diana, but Hellene replies that they would’ve been late as well and it would be disrespectful to the guests and her queen. Penelope, in a vicious tone, says that they should begin, so they can go back to where they came from. Philippus reminds her of her rudeness, even to her sisters. She asks if there’s something on her mind. Philippus suggests a search party, but she is cut short when Diana and Menalippe walk into the chamber. They apologise for being late, and take a seat at the table, eyeing the Golden Apples. Lois is confused about their behaviour, remembering their talk earlier. Maybe she’s just hiding her true feelings in front of the guests? But Lois thinks otherwise… Lois knows that Diana has eyes that tell her true feelings, and that her eyes right now tell her nothing. Diana then announces, “Let the Feast of Five begin!”</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>With Diana held captive by Eris, the spell of the golden apples infiltrates Paradise Island and spreads across the island to all those on it.</em></p><p>Eris' plan are working in perfect order, and Wonder Woman can't possibly help with her own current status; it's up to Lois Lane to save her!</p><p>Hermes is having a vision of Diana where she is floating in a void. He holds Diana and he tries to wake her, because that way, he knows she will be safe. Though she does not wake when he calls her name. Bark then splinters her flesh and she is choking from her own foliage. She then disappears and Hermes realises that he must go after her if she is to reclaim her soul. Hermes cries out her name, surprising Steve Trevor while he is driving. Steve asks Hermes what the problem is and he rips the seatbelt and flies across the field calling for Diana.</p><p>On Paradise Island, Lois listens to Menalippe who performs the opening ritual but something does not stick with her. Lois stares at Diana who stares back rather coldly. Menalippe finishes speaking but before they can actually begin the feast, Diana stands up and starts addressing the crowd. Diana thanks Menalippe for addressing the crowd and asks everyone to eat the Golden Apples that are placed in front of them. Rovo Quashi is suspicious and tells Lois not to eat them and realises that she is not the only one who is suspicious. Lois and Quashi refuse to eat theirs and Diana asks why. Lois says that she is on a diet.</p><p>Back in Man’s World, Hermes is upset about Diana and her soul. Steve walks over and tells Hermes that they need to get to Hackensack by 3pm and asks Hermes to get back into the car. But Hermes refuses saying that her soul is no longer in the mortal plane. Steve asks if she is dead, but Hermes replies that her soul is elsewhere and closes his eyes to search for her again.</p><p>On Themyscira, everyone is having fun at the banquet, but Rabbi Hecht throws his meat onto the plate, claiming that it isn’t kosher. One of the Amazons convince him that the meat is done as he likes, but he calls her a liar. He accuses her of poisoning him. Vladimir Morakov tells him to calm down and enjoy it while he can as women are the only thing in which women are good for. The rabbi challenges him to a fight while Phyllis Haller tells him that his comment was inappropriate. Hellene agrees and suggests that the Amazons take over Man’s World. Reverend Alan decides to join in and says this is what happens when natural order isn’t followed. Mnemosyne asks whose natural order it is exactly. Robert Cantwell then joins in and takes the side of the Amazons and believes that the Reverend is disrespecting the Amazon’s beliefs. Henri Claude Tibet interrupts and warns the Reverend to keep his hand off Mnemosyne or else she would sleep with a strange man. The Amazons the accuse him of thinking only about sex. Maritza Nitumbe then accuses Philippe of following a white queen and not standing up for her rights as a coloured person. Cantwell comes in again and Marizta tells him to be quiet. Felix Zumac then accuses them of believing he is responsible just because he is Haitian. Asmund Lindel then stands up and orders everyone to be quiet. Diana stands up and tells him that he has no right to order them around and that the only reason why they are here is because she deemed it okay. Hippolyta joins in as well and reminds her daughter that she is queen.</p><p>Lois realises what’s going on and realises that this story would get her into journalism-stardom. She brings out her camera, though Lin Koo Teng grabs it off her, accusing her of being an American journalist and smashes it on the ground. Rovo Quashi tells her to calm down, saying that Lois couldn’t help because she wasn’t in Tiananmen Square. Lin Koo snaps back, saying that he could never feel what it’s like when close friends die. Robert Cantwell then grabs Lin Koo and a fight breaks out between everyone. Cantwell suggests that they get out of here and drags Lin Koo with him. Lois grabs Rovo with her and Diana spots them sneaking out, with a cold face.</p><p>In the void, Wonder Woman’s soul is floating around and is watching these arguments and fights and struggles to break free as she wishes to fix the problem. She then falls back into unconsciousness. Steve asks why Hermes cannot connect with Diana and he replies that her hope is cut off from her soul. Without this hope, there is only confusion and despair.</p><p>Back on Themyscira, the people fight goes out onto the streets of Themyscira and Lois and the other three who escaped run down an alleyway, straight in Diana. Diana asks Lois if she’s in a hurry to bring in her story and starts mocking her by suggesting some headlines for her story. Diana then says, “This Great Mission of mine. It was all a farce. An act. Designed to prove what miserable people we all really are!” Lois replies that she is the only miserable person on this island but Rovo points out that this isn’t the real Wonder Woman and points out the way Wonder Woman is acting right now, as she would never do so if she were her real self. Lois demands to know where the real Wonder Woman is. Diana then asks Lin Koo what she thinks and she replies that she has learned that leaders cannot be trusted. Diana is offended by such comment and lunges for her and Lin Koo runs from her. Diana looks for Lin Koo, and Lois sneaks up on Diana and throws a rock over her head. Diana then grabs Lois by throat, throwing her away. As Lois goes into unconsciousness, she then sees the real Wonder Woman in her vision and she is struggling, as if she is fighting something. All of a sudden, the fake Diana melts into a puddle and Eris watches these events in anger.</p><p>Rovo comments on the puddle which smells like the apples that were at the banquet. Lois asks Cantwell if he ate an apple and Cantwell says he didn’t as he is allergic to apples, and Lin Koo at one. Lois points out that the apples may have been tainted. Lin Koo tells her that does not feel any different from what she usually is. Lois tells her to listen to herself, as she can hear the hatred in her voice. Lin Koo doesn’t listen, though, and believes they are following the typical stereotype of a Chinese girl, that they are quiet and polite. Lois adds that between the Rabbi and some other Amazons, an argument had broken out and that she saw apples in the temple too. She also notes that Menalippe had brought the apples in and that Diana was looking for Menalippe. On the street, they hi-jack some horses and make their escape but Philippus spots them. Menalippe orders the Amazons to arrest them and kill them if necessary. The four gallop through the woods and taking several turns to lose their pursuers, they end up in front of the statue at Doom’s Doorway. They see the cave opening Wonder Woman had fell in to and Lin Koo tells them that that had been fully blocked.</p><p>Cantwell grabs a torch and tells them that he is going to investigate. They make their way slowly inside and it’s very dark, even with the torch. Rovo hears Wonder Woman’s voice. They follow the voice and Lois begins feeling Wonder Woman’s presence. She pushes the other people aside, determined to find Wonder Woman. Rovo yells a warning, but it is too late as Lois falls through a hole. She grabs a root with one hand and secures a tighter hold for herself. She then sees something in the darkness; it’s Eris standing on a rock beside a tree – and embedded in the tree is Wonder Woman who has been turned into wood.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The fate of Lois Lane and the rest of the delegates rests with Diana--but can Wonder Woman break free of Eris' clutches?</em></p><p>Eris's plans finally come to a standstill as Wonder Woman, the Amazons and the delegates work together and understand a greater understanding of peace.</p><p>Lois is stuck in the void and stares down at Wonder Woman in awe. She tells the others who have not reached her yet to get help. Meanwhile, Eris who watching all the chaos unfold throws an apple down into the void and an explosion of white light opens up a portal which shows what’s happening on Themyscira – Amazons fighting each other. Lois tells Eris that this will end and the Amazons will do so as well. Eris throws another apple into the blackness and many serpent heads make their way up to the unsuspecting Rovo Quashi, Robert Cantwell and Lin Koo Teng. The serpent heads make their way over the ledge and grab Cantwell and Lin Koo and are pulled down into the void.</p><p>Back in America, Steve asks what happened to Hermes’ Cadeceus. He replies that he had to give it to Wonder Woman so she could cross the void between Man’s World and Themyscira. Steve is furious over that answer, as Wonder Woman wouldn’t be in this position now if Hermes had a backup plan! Hermes then asks what the Air Force would do and Steve replies that they would find the aggressor. Hermes says that that is what he is trying to do. He says it has been more difficult than usual because someone is blocking him, and he vows to stop whoever is doing so.</p><p>Back at Themyscira, Lois calls for Diana and asks for her help and she realises that Lois is calling her. But Eris tells Lois that Diana can’t help her. Cantwell asks who Eris is, and she replies that she is the daughter of war, his mother and his aunt. She stands for all chaos and strife. Cantwell then realises that Eris is connected with the Golden Apples and apologises for not spotting this earlier. She tells them not to blame themselves, as she had even fooled the Goddesses, leading to the war in Troy. Now the Amazons are doing the same thing by destroying themselves, as the fruit hides all the barriers of hate. Eris continues to explain how the reporters will now report back to Man’s World with stories of failure and disappointment. Lin Koo races up, yelling that she realises that she is “Wang Mu”, the creator of disease and death. She then slips and is holding onto Cantwell, crying tears of fear. Lois tells her to be brave and she tells her that she is going to help her out. Diana can hear the voice of the people around her and hears a voice calling for her. It’s Rovo Quashi. She telepathically tells him that he should get back to the city. She tells him to listen to her voice and get out of here. He gets onto a horse and the horse makes its way back to the city.</p><p>Eris manages to catch the boy escaping and says that whoever wishes to aid Diana will be killed. Meanwhile, Lois has helped Lin Koo regain her balance and she overhears Eris muttering Rovo’s name. Eris summons an image of Menalippe, as if controlling her actions. Cantwell knows that something is about happen involving Rovo and decides to throw an apple towards Eris. It knocks out the apple that Eris is holding. Eris turns to him and tells him that he is sorry for doing so. The Tree of Discord comes to life and feeds on the people’s blood and draining their life force. Lin Koo screams for Wonder Woman to help them out. Wonder Woman hears Lin Koo and replies weakly that she will help them. She then sees a vision in the distance. It is Hermes, telling her that she can nothing here, and that she should focus her energy on Rovo, as he is their only hope.</p><p>In the city, Rovo rides through the city as the fighting continues on. Menalippe spots him and raises a spear to throw at him, though Hellene stops her and tells her that they will not harm the helpless. Penelope then knocks Hellene out. Rovo makes it to safety and the two Amazons run after him. Hippolyta is watching all this and sees Hellene unconscious and questions what they are doing.</p><p>Inside, Menalippe and Penelope look for Rovo. They go inside a room to kill the boy, when they find an ghost-like version of Hermes, telling them to not kill mortals. If they ever will, they will be sorry for doing so. He tells them to wake up and realise what they are doing. They must stop what they are doing or else he will finish off the job for them. The Amazons run out as Hermes falls to the ground, as his energy used to disguise Rovo has sucked the life out of him. Rovo is revealed to be holding Wonder Woman’s costume. Rovo communicates with Diana, asking what he should do next. Diana tells him to find her mother and tell her to go to Doom’s Doorway. Hippolyta and a few other Amazons find Rovo. She asks Rovo where her daughter is, while Diana pleads for Hermes to make them understand. She questions why her god would leave her in her most desperate hour of need.</p><p>Back in America, Hermes collapses, Steve realises that Hermes needs a good earned rest.</p><p>On Themyscira, something is happening to the three as Wonder Woman who is integrated in to the tree starts blinking, as if she is alive again. Eris looks through the portal and sees Themyscira opening its eyes and she sees the Amazons drop their weapons. Many of the people who were fighting realise what they were doing. Timandra realised she had knocked down Henri Claude Tibet, and helps him back up again. Alan Witherspoon drops his weapons as well and Menalippe sees what happens and says that the Amazons cannot stand for this. Other delegates join in and agree with Menalippe.</p><p>Eris, watching through the portal, cries out in anger as she realises that her plan has been foiled. Eris turns to Wonder Woman and tells her that this isn’t over. However, Wonder Woman’s hand move and the four delegates with her cheer encouragement while Eris yells in frustration. The tree explodes and Diana sets herself free from the tree and makes her way in front of Eris. She flies towards her friends and helps them, ripping away the branches holding Cantwell, Lois and Lin Koo. Eris tells them that the apple feeds the animal within them that creates hate in everyone, including Wonder Woman! But Diana replies that for every beast, there is a lamb. The apple that Eris was holding bursts into flames and screams of pain. Wonder Woman carries the four back to safety and Lois asks what Wonder Woman had done to that apple. Wonder Woman says she did nothing. Cantwell explains that without hate, the apples can do nothing and Diana tells them to let go of their anger as that is the only way home.</p><p>She leaves the four on the ledge to safety and Wonder Woman flies back to Eris, who fires her own energy blast at Wonder Woman. She blocks them in time to block to attack but she gets thrown back into a wall. Wonder Woman keeps defending Eris’ energy blasts while Lois watches on. Wonder Woman is holding them back and she wonders how she can fight back without anymore destruction. She calls Athena for help. Eris tells Wonder Woman that her gods can do nothing for her. Eris thinks to finish the fight off with a blast to Wonder Woman’s head. Just in time, she blocks it. Then, Eris is surrounded by the Amazons. Hippolyta carries a bow and an arrow which hangs around Wonder Woman’s lasso. Hippolyta fires the bow into the tree trunk, as Wonder Woman grabs the lasso. She wraps it around the tree, as the Tree of Discord cannot stand the heat of the truth of the lasso, and the tree bursts into flames. Eris throws herself into the void below and Diana dives down, wondering what is going on with the goddess. Eris shouts back that she has a different path to hers and says goodbye to Diana, adding that she is definitely something different, one for the Olympians. A huge explosion happens, signifying her disappearance. The explosion however makes the chamber unstable. Hippolyta calls out that Diana has been killed, but Diana makes it out of the rocks buried on top of her and Hippolyta reaches for her hand and pulls her out. When all is well, Lois tells Diana that she beat Eris, but Diana replies that they all beat Eris. All the Amazons and delegates feel a sense of a well-deserved victory as they come together and this is what perhaps drives humanity. That there is a promise, a promise of peace.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Letters from camp from Vanessa, Lois Lane's article about Paradise Island, and Diana's letter to Julia are all presented in this unique issue.</em></p><p>Julia Kapatelis is at an archaeological site and is digging for the ruins of Themyscira. The mail arrives from a jeep and Julia looks through the pile for Vanessa’s mail. She sits down to read it. Reading it, Vanessa says that she is having fun so far and has a crush on a boy called Dennis Dunn and wishes she had a real bra like her friend Lucy. Vanessa has to stay with nine and ten year old kids and a senior counselor and are to say the Pledge of Alliance which she finds annoying, seeing as this is meant to be a camp of fun and not school.</p><p>Curtis steps out of the tent for coffee and Marty follows him, asking how long they are going to stay here for, as it has been two months and nothing has come up. Curtis steps back inside the tent and Julia asks him if Marty is thinking of quitting. He then asks Julia if that is Vanessa’s letter and she nods and adds that she hopes she has made the right decision by allowing her to go to Summer Camp. She adds that she has a strange feeling. Curtis asks for the newspaper on Julia’s bed and asks if he can read it as she continues to read Vanessa’s letter. Vanessa had been on a nature hike and took a swim in the lake. She noticed that Lucy had a real bust and she looked like nothing next to her and knows that Dennis likes Lucy too. She adds that Lucy is so lucky, having her period as well. She asks her mother when she had her period. “Fourteen,” Julia shouts out. She then asks Curtis what news he is reading, and says it’s about Wonder Woman. He goes to read the first paragraph:</p><p><i>Amidst the rubble of fear and bigotry left in the dust of Eris' departure, Queen Hippolyta and her Amazons re-dedicated themselves to the spirit of fidelity and sisterhood that was the basis for their Feast of Five and this Themysciran Summit. Princess Diana, known to the outside world as Wonder Woman, spoke of her Gods and their dreams of fulfillment through humanity's common destiny. </i></p><p>Somewhat shamefacedly Amazons and delegates had returned to the city to clean up the aftermath of the recent brawls. Of all the Amazons, Menalippe suffered the most. She felt her complicity with Eris had disavowed her sacred trust with the Goddesses. Everyone, including the delegates, worked to persuade her that any one of them could have fallen and indeed had fallen to the tainted sweetness of the Golden Apples. But according to the article's author, Lois Lane, it will be a long time before the Amazon oracle can face her Delphi again.</p><p>Soon the disparate cultures stood and faced each other for a final time. For a little while they had come together but would it last? Queen Hippolyta spoke all the right words - about harmony and understanding, optimism and hope. She promised to come to the United Nations soon. But it is so hard to make plans with immortals as their time frame is so different from the rest of the world.</p><p>Asmund Lindel promised the queen would be made welcome whenever she comes. Then amidst tears and hugs, the Themysciran Summit ended. With the goodbyes done, Wonder Woman told them it was time to go and like a biblical angel, she had lifted into the air, looping her golden lasso around the waiting delegates. A shimmer of light enveloped them all and they faded from view, returning across Chaos and back to Patriarch's World.</p><p>Julia continues to read her daughter’s letter: Vanessa tells of campfire for dinner and they told and listened to stories and Lucy asked if Vanessa could tell her story about Diana. Vanessa was uneasy about this, as she wanted people to know her for her, not who she knows, but then again, Lucy was never the one to be jealous. Also, Dennis was there so she may as well tell her story. She told the story of how she dived off a cliff from Paradise Island and tries to be honest just like Diana, but finds it difficult. Sometimes she looks in the mirror and hates herself, but realises everyone has their own time to develop, as unfair as that is. Vanessa and Lucy then had a walk and Lucy said that having breasts is no big deal. Vanessa asks if there is something wrong with her, and Lucy reassures her that nothing is. She continues to write how Lucy is perhaps the luckiest girl in the world, being able to travel to Europe and told Lucy about it. Lucy replies that Vanessa is the lucky one, as her parents don’t treat her like a child and adds that because of that, Vanessa understands life better than her. Vanessa knows she’s saying something of importance here but doesn’t understand.</p><p>Outside, the archaeologists see something fall into one of their digging spots and pick up a pigeon with something wrapped around its neck and let Julia know. Back in the tent, Julia continues reading about Vanessa’s experience at camp: Vanessa ran into the changing rooms all excited and yelled to Lucy, “I got it!” Lucy smiled and knew what Vanessa got: her period. Vanessa apologises in the letter to her mother about being immature and now she knows better and promises not to be like that in the future. She tells her mother that she loves her. Curtis then comes in and sees that she is crying from the letter. He offers to leave the tent for some alone time, but Julia shakes her head and Curtis continues, saying that they have found a tired bird. Julia recognises it and reads Diana’s message.</p><p>She reads: Diana says that she had accomplished this journey, and but felt she was rude that she just dropped off and left the delegates at the United Nations, but all she could think about was Julia, Vanessa and home. She sometimes wonders what it’s like just living as a “woman”. She wonders what it would be like if she could just be normal like Julia and Vanessa. But she doesn’t mean “normal” as unimportant, but rather doing everyday things like Vanessa “studying” when she is really talking to her friend on the phone, and it shames Diana to say that this life makes her jealous. But Julia and Vanessa have loved Diana for herself. She continues to say that she was disappointed when she found Julia had her archeological dig with Vanessa being on camp. She also looked for Hermes and thanked him for helping her through the situation with Eris. But now, he is not omnipotent and is a mortal, though some humanity should do him good. However, Hermes doesn’t deserve pity. Even though he is sometimes arrogant, he does what’s best for humanity. He had given her the Caduceus when in fact he needed it to save his fading power. She continues, saying that she couldn’t contact anymore, so she went to Steve Trevor’s apartment. The land lord had given her some verbal abuse about Steve sending a woman to do his bidding. Diana flew off and was frustrated and thought of returning to Themyscira, but she doesn’t want to run home everytime she feels down and wonders if she could join Julia on the dig. She doesn’t want to be a nuisance, but Etta Candy is away on an assignment, and Superman is busy. The people at Meyer Agency didn’t seem to have time for Wonder Woman. She adds that she misses Julia and would like to join; is that possible? Julia asks Curtis if that’s okay and he says that they can use some extra help. Julia writes a “Yes” and sends the messenger on its way. Julia asks if the bird is sick, as it looks like it has fear in its eyes but the others suggest that it’s tired. They let the bird fly and it struggles for a while but makes flight.</p><p>In Beacon Hill, Diana is reading a book recommended by Vanessa and wonders what Julia’s reply will be.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bird making its way back to Diana looks startled, as something flies right above it. A huge winged figure makes the bird fall…</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The Silver Swan makes her return, with Wonder Woman caught in the middle of it all over again.</em></p><p>In a testing facility, Silver Swan is flying about. In a nearby building, Henry Armbruster and Mister Choi watch Silver Swan and monitor her readings. Silver Swan then releases her sonic cry and hits Wonder Woman straight on. A helicopter then arrives with Armbruster and Choi as its passengers and a technician shows the head of an android Wonder Woman but Armbruster thinks otherwise. Silver Swan approaches him and smiles, but Armbruster pushes her away. She says that she destroyed the body, and isn’t that good enough? Armbruster, angry at the result, punches her and yells, “What do I want from you? What do I want?” He then tells her to go home, and she flies off. Mr. Choi tells Armbruster that he should give her encouraging words every now and then, and reminds him that she has changed. Armbruster then asks about Professor Buchman’s stolen files, and Mr. Choi replies that they are closing in on them.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Julia Kapatelis’ house, Diana speaks with Steve on the phone. She asks how Etta is and Steve replies that she is fine. However, Diana detects something in his voice and tells him that she is lying. She asks if there’s anything wrong with the engagement, and Steve replies that there isn’t, so far. She pushes him but he prefers not to talk about it, and Diana says that she is always there for him. He then says that the event at Themyscira sounds like it was pretty crazy. She agrees and asks if Hermes is there. Steve says that he is, and that he wanted the both of them to come to the bar together, though now Hermes is off with some ladies. Just then, a redneck comes out and says that Hermes is dealing with his lady. Steve wraps up the phone call, and catches a punch that the redneck threw and throws him to the floor. Suddenly, Steve finds himself surrounded by many men, and Hermes tells the ladies that Steve is trained, from the military, so he is able to handle himself. But Steve finds that the numbers are becoming overwhelming and finds himself held back by two men while another throws a punch. But just before that fist can hit Steve, Hermes grabs the fist and breaks the wrist. With his blistering speed, he takes down the other men and Steve tells him to stop showing off. Hermes gives the bartender some money for the damage and takes the beaten Steve outside.</p><p>At another Kapatelis residence, the police are interviewing a neighbour, Mrs. Gloria Sullivan, who was keeping an eye on the house for Julia. Her husband had found her tied to a chair and called the police. Gloria explains that there had been two intruders, and one of them was a woman. The officer in charger tells the other officer to call for Inspector Indelicato as Wonder Woman is sometimes seen at this house.</p><p>Back at the Kapatelis residence, where Diana is staying, she sleeps in her bed. Her hearing then hears a series of footsteps outside the house. She changes into her costume and flies up in the sky, scanning for the intruder and then hears the sounds of gunfire and a man screaming. She zooms into the location and finds several ninjas. She asks them what they have done and they only return in gunfire. She deflects them with her bracelets and tells them that she does not want to fight, but they do not listen and she has no choice but to bowl them over with her strength. The ninjas then bring out their knives, but it’s no use against Wonder Woman. She asks if they are ready to talk yet, but one ninja opens fire once again and she replies with a hit against him. One of the ninjas slip away and manage to fire darts towards the injured man, but Wonder Woman, with her lightning reactions and beats the darts and manages to block them off. The other ninjas use their martial arts, but she outclasses them in every way, and finally, uses her lasso to round them all up and looks towards the injured man. She introduces herself and he says that he is Solomon Buchman. He tells her that the ninjas must not get to the files. She replies, saying she does not know what he is talking about, but she realises this name and remembers that he has heard it before. She asks him if she has ever heard of the Silver Swan. Just then, another gunshot can be heard from the house, and Wonder Woman races back to the house and finds another ninja who she stops, and a woman who says that Diana must take this to help Val, before she kills them all. Diana asks who this “Val” is, but before the lady can answer, she is interrupted by some more gunfire and flies back to Buchman as he fires his gun into the air. Diana then realises that the woman who was in Julia’s house was Maxine Sterenbuch, Valerie’s friend. Wonder Woman then hears the sonic cry and realises that it’s Silver Swan’s calling card. Before Wonder Woman can go after the Silver Swan though, the cry hits her and she falls to the ground. Maxine runs to where Wonder Woman fell and helps her to her feet. The both of them stare in awe at the spot in which the ninjas and Buchman lay, which has replaced them with an empty crater and Wonder Woman’s lasso.</p><p>However, Silver Swan has grabbed Solomon by the neck and Maxine tells her to stop this madness. Valerie is not the person she is now as she was always caring and loving, but now she has turned into this. Maxine doesn’t understand as she was always as good as anyone else but no one would believe what they said, until Armbruster turned up. Silver Swan replies quite harshly, telling her shut up and that Maxine is just wrong, that he had been right about her all along. Maxine had used Valerie and she will never forget that. Maxine replies that that’s not true and Valerie asks why she is standing with Wonder Woman, and Maxine replies that she feels safer with her. Valerie then tells her friend that she would never hurt her and that she was only trying to take the bag from her. Maxine holds out the bag for Valerie and tells her that she will prove that she is still her friend. With this distraction, Wonder Woman makes for her lasso and the Silver Swan then realises that she isn’t there. She tells Maxine that she lied to cover up Wonder Woman. At the same time, Wonder Woman is speeding towards Silver Swan. Silver Swan opens her mouth, as Wonder Woman flies towards her, with a explosion in the entire area.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The tragic past of the Silver Swan is revealed.</em></p><p>A continuation from the previous issue, dealing with Silver Swan's emotions. And it doesn't go so well.</p><p>Silver Swan releases her sonic cry while still tied up in Wonder Woman’s lasso. Maxine, Solomon and Wonder Woman crouch behind a rock while Silver Swan destroys the area around her. The screaming finally stops, and Wonder Woman pokes her head out to see where the Silver Swan is. She sees something like a deformity and Silver Swan cries out for Armbruster not to abandon her. She then flies off, taking Wonder Woman with her.</p><p>Elsewhere, some technicians are telling Mr. Choi that they have lost contact with the Silver Swan. The technicians tell him it will take half an hour to re-connect with her. Mr. Choi informs Armbruster of the problem and annoyingly tells them to quickly fix it. He then looks at a photo of Valerie and throws it against the wall.</p><p>Back with Silver Swan, continues flying, taking Wonder Woman with her. Diana reasons with her, but Silver Swan tells her if she doesn’t let go, she’ll kill them both. Silver Swan begins to get into a frenzy again, and Wonder Woman counters this with a flick from her lasso and throws the Silver Swan into the lake below. Maxine rushes to the lake and yells to Wonder Woman that Valerie can’t swim. Wonder Woman flies down and lifts her out of the water. Maxine asks why she had to be so rough on her, and Wonder Woman replies that she had no choice. Diana explains that Valerie isn’t hurt, but Solomon and Maxine are. Maxine pleads not to get the doctors involved, especially the police because the both of them broke in Julia’s house to find Diana. Also, the police will treat Valerie like a monster if they get a hold of her. Maxine continues to explain that this is all Hank Armbruster’s fault. He was the one that turned her into this. Maxine and Solomon had been trying to get Valerie out of his clutch, and that’s why the ninjas came and attacked him. Wonder Woman, confused explains that it felt as if Valerie didn’t want their help, though Diana had felt her pain when she grabbed hold of the lasso. Maxine explains that that was Valerie’s true self. She continues to explain that Armbruster uses Wonder Woman as someone Valerie could never live up to. Maxine says that with Diana’s lasso, they can now get inside her mind and help her out.</p><p>Wonder Woman is still confused though, and asks why Solomon had attempted to shoot Silver Swan and why would he want to help her now? Maxine pulls out some records Solomon’s father had been keeping. Armbruster had taken them and they stole it. So that’s why Armbruster wants them dead. They then hear helicopters coming towards them and Maxine says that it’s Armbruster’s men. The lead pilot radios his boss, saying that he can see three survivors. Armbruster orders him to kill everyone there, even Valarie, as long as they get the records back. Down below, they hear the helicopter warning them to release the Silver Swan and too give back the records. Wonder Woman questions them by asking who they are and demands that they identify themselves first. Meanwhile, Maxine is pleading with Valerie, asking her to help them out. Valerie replies that she can’t, or Armbruster will kill her. Valerie is still confused and wonders why her lover would want to kill her. Maxine reminds her of the things that Armbruster has done for her: nothing. Valerie stands up and cannot stand for her friend getting hurt. Valerie asks Maxine for the files. Wonder Woman tells Maxine that Valerie had the lasso around her so she is telling the truth.</p><p>Silver Swan flies up towards the helicopter and tells the lead helicopter to stop what they’re doing, in the name of Hank Armbruster. The pilot asks Armbruster if they need new orders, and Armbruster orders his men to stand by. Armbruster then seeks advice from Mr. Choi, and Mr. Choi tells him that Armbruster should’ve allowed her to visit Maxine. He then tells her to reason with her as Valerie seems as she is still on the side of her mentor and lover. Armbruster talks with Valerie and tells her to go home. She asks why she can’t talk with her friend and Armbruster orders her to come home with a scowl. He then orders his men to open fire on her. The helicopters then open fire on Silver Swan, and Wonder Woman flies up and blocks the bullets with her bracelets. Silver Swan pushes Wonder Woman out of the way and uses her sonic scream, destroying the cockpit of the helicopters. The helicopters ask if they can retreat, but Armbruster orders them to keep firing. With that, Silver Swan increases the intensity of her scream and begins to destroy the helicopters’ weapons. Silver Swan loses her breath and stops screaming. Exhausted, she falls from the sky and Wonder Woman flies to catch her as the helicopters fly back to base. Armbruster angrily questions Mr. Choi on how both Wonder Woman and Silver Swan can still be alive. Mr. Choi retaliates, saying that it should not be blamed on him. He was not the one who pushed her so hard. However, Armbruster has a smug look on his face. She will return to him – it’s just a matter of time.</p><p>On Paradise Island, an Amazon called Ismure enters the healing room as Epione heals Solomon. Hippolyta and Euboea watch the treatment and Euboea asks why this man is here. Hippolyta replies that Diana had brought him here and gave an Amazon’s promise that this man would completely heal and recover to Maxine. Euboea asks Hippolyta why they would bring him here if they are just bullet wounds. Surely Man’s World has dealt with bullet wounds before. Hippolyta wonders that too, though she is certain her daughter would’ve taken this man to a Man’s World hospital, so there must be a reason why he is brought here.</p><p>At Massachusetts, Diana thanks Etta Candy for taking care of Maxine and Valerie. However, something is troubling Etta and she feels that around Diana’s presence. Maybe it’s because Diana’s so beautiful, or maybe because they would’ve gotten married by now. Wonder Woman explains that they are nothing more than friends and that Steve loves Etta very much. Etta replies that it’s not a matter of love, but of time. She loves her job, but together with the Hermes, being around Steve could be a problem. Wonder Woman now realises how Etta feels and that she and the others will leave if she wants. Etta feels that that’s not necessary, as she has the video set up for them. Maxine and Valerie then come out of a room, with Maxine comforting Valerie, as they prepare to watch the video from Buchman’s laboratory. As the tape begins to play, they see the Silver Swan release one of her sonic screams to Professor Benjamin Bunchman, Solomon’s father. Maxine tells Valerie that she does not have to watch the video if she wants, but Valerie says that she wants to. Valerie explains that she was defending her and Armbruster, who Buchman was trying to kill.</p><p>The others do not believe her however and snarls, but Maxine asks her to tell her story from the beginning. Valerie says that she was ugly and unloved, until Armbruster appeared. He did not care for her looks. Though Valerie knew that he would lose money because of her, as he was a rich businessman. Armbruster offered his help, and had found Ben Buchman and given him money to make Valerie happy. Buchman had developed a special liquid and Valerie was dipped in it. When it was finished, Valerie was revealed in front of a mirror, and she was so happy with the result – she was beautiful. Valerie begins to cry as she realises that she has turned her back on the man that helped her out when nobody would. Diana reminds her that Armbruster had tried to kill her some hours ago. Valerie snaps back, saying that Diana knows nothing about men, especially coming from a woman who came from a female society. Diana replies that she knows enough about men that they wouldn’t hurt the woman they love. Valerie replies that she is wrong. Armbruster had in fact protected her from Buchman. Buchman wanted to experiment on her some more but she didn’t want to. Armbruster assured her that it was alright, so she climbed back in the tank. She then heard Buchman and Armbruster arguing, and then there had been a flash of light, and she woke up to find herself floating while the tank had exploded. She then saw Buchman was a monkey wrench in her hand, and Armbruster on the floor. It was obvious that Buchman was trying to kill Armbruster. She then had this urge to release something from her stomach. She kept building it up, and then released a sonic scream that destroyed the whole laboratory. Armbruster then taught her how to use her scream so no one else would hurt her.</p><p>Maxine then asks sarcastically, “Or still ugly, right Val? A fate worse than death.” Maxine then talks about the letters they had sent each other. Maxine does not care what Valerie looks like. How could she believe what Armbruster had said about her? Valerie replies that Armbruster still loves her. If Maxine had really cared, then she wouldn’t be trying to kill her. She brushes if off though, as she says that she will die soon anyway. Wonder Woman asks what that means and Valerie walks out of the room. Maxine suggests that Wonder Woman use her lasso on her, but Wonder Woman says that she shouldn’t as she is emotionally fragile, and that doing so could be very harmful. Etta then calls them to her computer, where she was looking at Buchman’s files. Etta says she looked over Valerie’s body scans, and that she spotted some weird. It seems as if there are differences in the body scans – that there are two Silver Swans! They then hear a noise from the other room and sees Silver Swan fly out the window up to a helicopter. Before she can react, she hears another noise where Etta and Maxine were, and find them being held at gunpoint by Armbruster’s men.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The lasso of truth brings to light the true past of the Silver Swan.</em></p><p>The confrontation between the Silver Swan and Hank Armbruster finally begins.</p><p>Wonder Woman wakes up in an electrified cage with her tiara and lasso removed. She demands to know where Maxine and Etta are. Mr. Choi replies, saying that she shouldn’t ask any questions. She tells him that she can simply break free, though Mr. Choi replies that she shouldn’t. Even though she could break free, even with her pain tolerance, doing so will cause Etta and Maxine’s cage to overload, causing them to die a death of being electrocuted. Mr. Choi also mentions her lasso, and what it did to him and how it compelled him to tell the truth. Mr. Choi then goes on to survey the monitors with Maxine, Etta and Wonder Woman on them. Maxine demands to know where Valerie is, and Mr. Choi tells her to be quiet, as she doesn’t know the politics of power. He then turns on a switch which sends a feed of Valerie hugging Armbruster elsewhere in the complex.</p><p>At the laboratory where Valerie and Armbruster are hugging, Valerie apologises for leaving him and Armbruster tells her not to worry over spilt milk. She tells him that if she keeps acting like this, he will eventually leave her. Armbruster tells her that she is weak minded, and will believe anything with a smile, and that’s how Maxine and Wonder Woman used it against her. Wonder Woman watches from her cage and the words that Armbruster is putting into Valerie’s head. He adds that Wonder Woman is just jealous of Valerie. Maxine yells at the video feed, but Etta tells her to calm down. Mr. Choi is like a poker player – there’s a certain time to change them, but for now Etta tells her that they should follow his rules for now. Etta speaks to Mr. Choi about the file she saw about the cat scans and points out that one was titled “Reversion Experiment”. Wonder Woman adds that when she battled Silver Swan, she saw something very ugly. Mr. Choi, with his poker face, doesn’t respond to this. Wonder Woman then asks why the Silver Swan hates her so much. Mr. Choi replies that she is a paragon of a perfect women, and that makes a perfect target for Silver Swan’s insecurities. An added bonus would be the ability to test out Silver Swan’s scream on Wonder Woman because of her durability. Maxine then chirps in, alerting Wonder Woman to Valerie making her way inside a tank, wrapped in bandages. Etta then tells her that this is Diana’s chance to prove what she’s made of. With that, Diana breaks through the cage, electrifying Maxine and Etta.</p><p>The monitors blow from the surge of electricity and Armbruster asks Mr. Choi on what’s happening. Mr. Choi tells Armbruster that Wonder Woman has broken out and that they have underestimated her. The technicians then tell Armbruster that they have to shut down to check for any damage to the equipment. Armbruster then asks his security guards if they have located Wonder Woman, but the security guards reply, saying that perhaps she had been killed in the electrocution. Armbruster then asks the technicians if Valerie has been harmed, and they reply that they can’t be sure because Professor Buchman has never been past this stage of experiments. Valerie’s brain could be damaged. Armbruster tells his technicians to continue, saying that if she dies, then so be it. Through the chamber, Valerie is outraged from hearing so.</p><p>Wonder Woman makes her way to Choi’s office, knocking the gun out of his hand. She grabs Choi with one hand and grabs her taken equipment with her other hand, and demands to know where Maxine and Etta are. Mr. Choi tells her and within a few moments, breaks open the cage with Maxine and Etta in it, still alive. Surprised, she asks how they survived. Etta tells her that they had been standing on a rubber waist trimmer. Wonder Woman carries them to Mr. Choi with the lasso wrapped around him. Maxine, angry, demands to know where Valerie is.</p><p>Back in the experimenting room, the power levels are off the charts as Armbruster demands to know what’s happening. The technicians inform him that Silver Swan is creating the power surges, and Armbruster tells Valerie to calm down or the experiment will be ruined. Suddenly, a massive explosion creates a disruption in the building. The ceiling begins to fall apart and Wonder Woman holds it up. As the dust settles, Armbruster makes a run for it with Silver Swan behind him. Armbruster looks for something to protect himself when Wonder Woman wraps him in her lasso.</p><p>Valerie uses her sonic scream to look for Armbruster when Wonder Woman steps in asking Valerie to stop what she’s doing. Valerie warns Wonder Woman that she will count down to three. When she hits one, Maxine steps in between them, and says that this will stop. No one will get hurt. Silver Swan replies, by saying that she loves the Silver Swan, and not Valerie as nobody does. Mr. Choi then chirps in, saying that Valerie should open her eyes and that she should not feel sorry for herself. Mr. Choi tells Armbruster to tell the truth. Armbruster, surprised, refuses but Mr. Choi says that the only way out of this situation is to tell the truth. There is no other choice anyway. Armbruster then begins to recount the events leading up to this one. Armbruster begins, saying that Valerie didn’t kill Professor Buchman, and that it was an accident. All Armbruster really wanted to do was make money, while Professor Buchman wanted to help Valerie, as the radiation made her ugly, though it gave her gift, and that was reshaping things with her voice. Professor Buchman wanted to help her by rearranging her molecules to fix her voice. However, Armbruster saw this as an opportunity to make money from this technology and maybe even become bigger than Lex Luthor. Professor Buchman was against this and said that Valerie would never agree to this, though Armbruster says that he seduced her and took advantage from there on. Maxine then interrupts asking whether Armbruster really loved Valerie or not. Armbruster replies that he never loved her – how could anyone love someone as ugly as her? Armbruster continues explaining, saying that Buchman was not fond of this idea because of work ethics. Buchman had then discovered Armbruster’s plans to sell this idea to overseas investors and Buchman didn’t want this risk to Valerie’s life. Armbruster and Buchman then got into a fight and then the explosion happened.</p><p>Silver Swan cries out in guilt from the fact that she killed an innocent man. Maxine replies that she didn’t kill Buchman, as Armbruster had said. Armbruster had lied about her killing Buchman. However, Maxine’s letters had almost revealed Armbruster’s plans and it had also surprised him that she teamed up with Solomon Buchman. Even though Silver Swan was powerful, her up against Wonder Woman on their first encounter was an unfair match, with Wonder Woman overpowering Silver Swan easily. Armbruster then decided that she needed a power up, so he put her through the experiment again. She had been powered up successfully, but she had been transformed into something uglier than before. Armbruster himself was shocked, but he played the lover by calming her down with alcohol. Mr. Choi then mentions some mutant type heroes and their powers. Wonder Woman replies in acknowledgement, and that it happened during the Alien Invasion. Armbruster then says that Choi believed there was something wrong with her gene that caused this. Mr. Choi advised Armbruster that this was fixable, and so Armbruster hired the top scientists to revert her back. She was reverted back, but she had lost her strong power. Armbruster decided to experiment on her some more and so she was brought back to the beautiful form of the Silver Swan. Before Armbruster could experiment on Valerie once again for more power, Maxine and Solomon had stepped in. Maxine says that Valerie had been nothing more than a money making scheme. Maxine then asks whether they told her the experiments could kill her. Choi replies that he gladly would’ve, though it was up to Armbruster, and he had not asked Choi to tell Valerie about the danger of the experiments. Valerie then glares at Armbruster who shows his frightened state. She walks towards him when Wonder Woman steps in between them, and reminds her that this is not Valerie. Maxine asks Valerie to come home, and Valerie runs into Maxine’s arms.</p><p>A few days later on Themyscira, Solomon thanks Wonder Woman on the Amazons healing them. Solomon is then told of the events that happened a few days earlier, and Solomon cannot believe this is happening. Wonder Woman replies that Valerie wishes to talk to him and explain what happened, but she is afraid. Solomon doesn’t want to talk to her either. Wonder Woman asks if he is afraid, and Solomon replies that he isn’t, as his life with his father is over now and has no direction now. Can Wonder Woman say the same?</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>A \"very special issue\" revealing the tale of Lucy Spears, young friend of Vanessa Kapatelis that took her own life.</em></p><p>George Perez and Mindy Newell write out a story that deals with the issues of teen suicide.</p><p>A priest at a funeral speaks about Lucy Spears, young friend of Vanessa Kapatelis. Mr and Mrs. Spears sob together, while Vanessa’s mother, Julia comforts her and Diana wipes her own tears away. It’s unfortunate that someone so young had wanted to take their life away. Lucy’s casket is later carried out and Vanessa says good bye to her friend. Julia watches and asks if Vanessa is too young for this. Diana replies with a question, asking if anyone is too old for this. Julia says that Vanessa had lost a brother when she was younger and never knew him. Julia scorns herself for her dig at Turkey. Diana says that she shouldn’t scorn herself over this. Perhaps it was herself that was selfish, making her own way over to Turkey. Julia says that she puts too much upon herself, and that she is glad that Diana came over to visit her. Julia remembers the day that she received the message about Vanessa. The team at Turkey had found a chalice and asked for Dr. Stavros Christadoulodou’s help because she had told Diana to rest after the evens of the Silver Swan. Then, she received the message.</p><p>Julia comes back to present time where she’s driving Diana, Vanessa and Eileen to the cemetery, following the hearse. Vanessa remembers when Lucy asked her what God looked like. Vanessa replies jokingly that he would look like Patrick Swayze and that she would look like Jennifer Grey, proving that God does like flat-chested women! Lucy told her to stop obsessing over breasts when Vanessa told her to stop obsessing over God and death. Vanessa had asked Lucy, “What is with you nowadays?” Now, Vanessa realises what was really with her. Vanessa then thinks about the day Lucy got caught raiding the boy’s bunks at camp. Vanessa was reassuring her that nothing too bad would happen. It would just be a small lecture and it would be over, but Vanessa had never realised what Lucy’s parents were really like. The group finally arrives at the cemetery where the priest begins to speak about Lucy. Vanessa looks over at Lucy’s other friends and remember the day when Vanessa asked about their plans after school. Lucy had bit back though, paying her out about playing with her Wonder Woman dolls. Lucy told her that they were too young to be playing dolls in junior high. Vanessa was hurt and ran off in the other direction. Lucy had told her new found friends that Vanessa liked to stuff tissue paper down her top, and upon hearing this, Eileen told Lucy that she had no right to hurt others just because she was hurt inside herself. Lucy’s new friends asked what that meant, but Lucy ignored it. Eileen went to console Vanessa, and told her that she shouldn’t be so upset. It’s just one quarrel, and there’s no doubt that the both of them will be friends again. Vanessa however, told Eileen to get away from her. Vanessa tells Eileen that she never realised all this. She never realised how lonely Lucy must have been. Eileen says that Vanessa is not to blame for this.</p><p>Julia and Diana look on to the two girls and Diana says that the both of them will definitely help each other out through these tough times. Julia talks about Diana being strong in this as well. She remembers when Diana had flown Julia all the way home so she could be with her daughter. Diana remembers when she visited her mother to ask about Lucy’s death. Hippolyta replied that being lonely is like a disease; it’s hard to deal with. They cannot ask for help, and they can’t hear it either. Diana replies that Lucy didn’t seem lonely, she was happy and vibrant. Hippolyta replies that perhaps Lucy was hiding her true feelings. Diana thinks to herself, and wonders if there was anything she could do to save her friend. Julia asks herself why Lucy had done this. It has hurt Vanessa deeply. Her grades are falling, and she’s rude to both students and teachers. She sits alone at lunchtime. The principal suggests taking Vanessa to a psychiatrist. The burial service comes to a close and Vanessa goes to hug Mr. and Mrs. Spears who are standing alone, over their daughter’s grave. Julia then remembers the day how things had changed when she had gone over to Mr. and Mrs. Spears’ house after Lucy’s death.</p><p>Mrs. Spears had yelled at Vanessa, saying that it was her fault. Vanessa started crying and ran towards the car. Julia had yelled back at Mrs. Spears, lecturing her for yelling at Vanessa and putting the blame on her. Mr. Spears had come out and told them to leave before he would call the police. Later that day, Eileen had come to visit Vanessa. Julia then regretted shouting at the Spears. Diana told her that she was simply angry and was only protecting Vanessa. Upstairs, Eileen was trying to convince Vanessa that it wasn’t her fault. It was Lucy who had the problems. Vanessa asks Eileen how she knows all this, and Eileen replies that she’s been through all this. Vanessa wonders how she had not seen this, and she scorns herself for being a terrible friend. Eileen hugs her and tells her that it is not her fault at all.</p><p>Diana then went to visit Lucy’s parents by herself. Mr. Spears told her to leave and should think that Vanessa’s lucky for not being brought up on murder charges. Mrs. Spears then appears and told him to stop being so rude. She apologises for his and hers behaviour from before and invites Wonder Woman into the house. Mrs. Spears brings Diana upstairs to Lucy’s room and she is shocked to see this entire Wonder Woman memorabilia. Mrs. Spears explains that Lucy was jealous of Vanessa because she had a Wonder Woman doll where Lucy had wanted that exact same one, but they had refused to buy her one. She explains that they told Lucy she was too old for dolls, and that if Vanessa had the real thing at her house, then surely, a doll wouldn’t hurt. If they loved her, they would’ve understood. The both of them loved their daughter and would do anything to make her happy. They let her enter beauty pageants. Lucy’s parents didn’t like them because they thought they were degrading, but Lucy said this money won would help her will college. They themselves should have realised what was happened. She was getting A’s in school, and she had wanted to become a beauty queen as well. Mrs. Spears explains that she never goes near the garage anymore because it was <i>her</i> keys that Lucy used to start the car while the garage door was closed.</p><p>Wonder Woman then bids them farewell and tells them that they have to fight through this and that they should never give up. The Spears thank her for her kindness and ask her to apologise on their behalf for Vanessa earlier.</p><p>Back at present day, Vanessa offers Mr. and Mrs. Spears a photograph with a chalk drawing of her and Lucy. Vanessa asks them for their forgiveness and Mrs. Spears hugs Vanessa, telling her that they know she loved Lucy as much as they did.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>It's a double-sized 'Nuff Said issue that ushers in a new direction for Earth's Most Reluctant Heroes! The lead story, written, penciled and inked by Erik Larsen brings his run to a finish, as the Defenders are brought by the curse to a realm in which there is no sound. They can't get along when they can communicate -- so how will they cope in a world where they can't? In the second story, written by Kurt Busiek and Jo Duffy, and drawn by Ivan Reis, the Defenders have had enough of the curse, and travel into the bowels of the Earth to petition Gaea to release them -- and her response sends the team and the series in a radically new direction! OVERLORDS: DEFENDERS AGAINST THE EARTH starts in February... but the action starts right here!</p>",
