    "description": "<p><em>A RICH GIRL THOUGHT SHE COULD DO WHATEVER SHE WANTED... SHE WAS WRONG.</em></p><p><em>Natasha Collins is the young, pretty daughter of Police Chief Collins. She lives a life of privilege; her beautiful mother Helena is the sole heiress to the Tunt family fortune, and Natasha has grown up in a world of luxury. Despite her wealthy background, Natasha is not an airheaded party girl; she is a keen student, top of her class, enrolled in an elite university and spends her spare time helping out at a soup kitchen for the homeless. But Natasha has a secret. She is a jewel thief known as “the sex burglar” who steals from the rich while they are distracted by having sex. She steals to help fund her favorite charities, but also just because she can.</em></p><p><em>NOW SHE HAS MADE AN ENEMY OF THE SERBIAN MOB</em></p><p><em>Unfortunately for Natasha, she chose the wrong target when she stole from the beloved daughter of an associate of the brutal crime boss, Vuk Draganovic. Vuk is the head of the Serbian Mob, and is feared throughout the city. Many innocent girls have come to rue the day their paths crossed with this Mobster.</em></p><p><em>THE MOB KNOWS HOW TO TEACH GIRLS TO BEHAVE</em></p><p><em>But what people don't realize is that Vuk Draganovic has a mole inside the police force. Detective Darinka O'Malley is a decorated cop and one of Chief Collins’ closest confidantes, but unbeknownst to the chief she belongs to Vuk. Literally.</em></p><p><em>THE MOB ALREADY OWNS A POLICE WOMAN WHO SERVES THEM AS A SLAVE, BREAKING ANOTHER GIRL’S SPIRIT WILL BE EASY</em></p><p><em>When she is not out at work for either of her bosses, Chief Collins or Vuk Draganovic, Detective O’Malley must be naked and chained in Draganovic's warehouse. Her body is used and abused by the mobster and his men. It is O'Malley who uncovered the Sex Burglar's identity and it is O'Malley who will bring her to Draganovic. Natasha.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p> </p>",

O'Malley is a dirty cop, who secretly serves the Serbian mob, from inside of her city's police force. But even more than that, O'Malley is a sex slave!</em></p><p><em>The beautiful, young Darinka serves her cruel mobster boss with all her body and soul. O'Malley is a completely devoted servant to her boss, Vuk Draganovic. She is a willing and enthusiastic slave. O'Malley is happy to be a slave, and wants only to earn the approval of her owner. For years, she has used her position as a police detective to take out her boss's enemies for him.</em></p><p><em> A TRUE SLAVE'S DEVOTION KNOWS NO LIMIT</em></p><p><em>Now, a new enemy has appeared. And this time, the enemy is one of O'Malley's oldest and closest friends. In order to serve her boss, O'Maley will have to betray a friend whom she has known for years! But O'Malley doesn't hesitate for even a moment. She would do anything for her boss; even betray the women closest to her.</em></p><p><em>THE MOB KNOWS HOW TO TEACH LITTLE GIRLS TO BEHAVE</em></p><p><em>O'Malley's friend is the ambitious, young assistant District Attorney, Alison Palmer. A potential career-making case has somehow landed in Alison's lap. The investigation of feared Serbian mobster Vuk Dragnovic became hers when the District Attorney mysteriously quit the case. Alison thinks she has a key witness, but as the old saying goes \"if you come at the King, you'd best not miss.\" Draganovic is the sort of man who takes slights personally, and Alison may come to regret putting herself in his crosshairs...</em></p><p><em>ANY WOMAN CAN BE BROKEN AND CONTROLLED, IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES</em></p><p><em>O’Malley has made it her duty to abduct the key witnesses against Vuk Draganovic, destroying Alison’s case. The woman who was planning to testify will now endure a lifetime of brutal punishment. But Vuk is not willing to stop there. He will also unleash his fury on Assistant DA Alison Palmer. He will bend his former enemy to his will and take over her life, just as he has done to so many other women before her. And his loyal slave Darinka O’Malley will be there to help him, every step of the way...</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em> ANYONE CAN BE BROKEN</em></p><p><em>Fans of the Bad Lieutenant Saga have come to expect a unique blend of non-stop sexual domination mixed seamlessly with in-depth character development and exciting crime drama. Part 4 of our story more than lives up to this series’ well-earned reputation.</em></p><p><em>Serbian mobster Vuk Draganovic is a master at turning women into his slaves. Throughout the course of our story, we have seen him take over the lives of Detective Lieutenant Darinka O’Malley (the daughter of his former enemy), Assistant District Attorney Alison Palmer (the lawyer who tried to prosecute Vuk for his crimes), and Natasha Collins (the daughter of the Chief of Police).</em></p><p><em>…BUT WHAT HAPPENS THEN?</em></p><p><em>Vuk’s most recent slave acquisition is former accountant Hannah Seacombe. Vuk’s trusted slave, Detective O’Malley, is giving Hannah an “orientation” to her new life as a modern-day slave. But while Hannah is learning to give up her old life and submitting to ever-increasing torture and sexual abuse, something very interesting happens…Hannah grows ambitious. Just how useful a slave can she become?</em></p><p><em>Using her skills from her old life, Hannah finds new ways to serve her boss’s interests. She puts her brains to use for her new owners, while at the same time taking cocks up her ass and piss down her throat.</em></p><p><em>THE REAL JOURNEY BEGINS WHEN RESISTANCE ENDS</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile, Police Chief Collins is still searching for his missing daughter Natasha. Collin’s has reached out to be mysterious outsider who claims they can help bring Vuk down. But what Collins doesn’t realize is that by now, Natasha’s personality has been completely re-written. “Natasha” is now a slave-girl named “Mackica” and Chief Collins’ daughter no longer exists.</em></p><p><em>Each girl responds to her slavery differently. But once a woman becomes a slave, there is no turning back. Each woman in our story has been taught her proper place in life, by use of brutal sexual abuse. And the more harshly the women are trained, the more radically they come to accept their situations.</em></p><p><em>A TRUE SLAVE’S DEVOTION KNOWS NO LIMIT</em></p><p><em>In the process of giving up their old identities, the slave-girls in our story form deep emotional bonds with their new owners and with each other. These bonds are often much stronger than any connection they felt with anyone in their old lives. Being a slave can quickly become the defining characteristic of a woman’s life.</em></p><p><em>Fans of the Bad Lieutenant Saga know that these comics have proven adult entertainment can be hot and sexy, while also being interesting and well-written at the same time. Artist Arieta and writer Robinja have created a complex universe, populated by characters who grow and change over the course of time. This is truly a comic not to be missed!</em></p>",

In honor of their long, and lucrative, business relationship Pasha has invited the McCoy family to his palace for a holiday. He’s brought along his wife and daughter as well, although they’re not exactly happy about staying in a country embroiled in a vicious and bloody civil war.</em></p><p><em>When Abdul-Hamad Pasha’s reign comes to an abrupt end at the hands of one his own soldiers, Al McCoy finds himself following his best customer down into the depths of hell. And they’re the lucky ones. Unfortunately his wife and daughter will find themselves wishing they too had been killed in the uprising when they’re forced to become slaves alongside Pasha’s widow, Yasmin.</em></p><p><em>General Mashud, the man behind the rebellion, quickly arrives to lay claim to his prize: Yasmin herself. He’s been longing after her for a long time, and now the little slut will obey his every command, or suffer the consequences. And fate has also delivered into his hands two gorgeous American sluts, and he’s going to use their tight, adorable bodies until they’re completely used up.</em></p><p><em>This is the McCoy family’s last holiday, and it’ll be filled with more sex, suffering and sadism than they ever thought possible. Even in their worst nightmares.</em></p><p><em>This is one family vacation you’ll want to see all the pictures of, that’s for sure. Another great comic from Cagri!</em></p>",

At least, that’s what Julia thinks, but what she doesn’t know is that the former anchorwoman, Wanda, is planning her revenge. Wanda lost her hand and foot to a car accident, and then Julia came along and took her job as well. Was Julia behind Wanda’s accident? Who cares, once Julia’s soft pink cunt is being pounded by Wanda’s prosthetic cock it doesn’t really matter if she’s guilty. She’s going to suffer regardless.</em></p><p><em>Julia’s claims that she’s innocent only serve to make Wanda angrier, and soon Julia’s punishments become even more cruel. Her punishments become ever more inventive and humiliating, including being forced to confront her fear of rats while getting her tight asshole fucked with a strapon and having to fuck and suck the revolting security guard from the TV station that she had fired. Julia finally breaks when Wanda shoves an electrified dildo up her ass, admitting her guilt while her shit tunnel fries…</em></p><p><em>Julia was on easy street, her whole life ahead of her. Now she’s just a quivering set of holes covered in cum, sweat, and tears. That’s what happened when Julia met Wanda!</em></p><p><em> </em></p>",

Her newest story is about the famous Valerio family, entrepreneurs and philanthropists on the outside but hiding a worldwide meth empire underneath. She’s going to expose Rocco Valerio for the world to see, and she’s going to do it by dating his son Marco.</em></p><p><em>Rocco didn’t build up his empire by being sloppy, however, and Nickie is exposedfor the sneaking rat she is. Marco is heartbroken to find out that the girl he loves is actually just using him to bring down his family, but his despair quickly turns to rage.

Now all that’s left for Nickie is the monster Marco will become to teach her a lesson.</em></p><p><em>Together with his father Nickie will have all her holes plugged with cocks, her ass and tits whipped repeatedly, and forced to eat dog food like the little bitch she is. Nickie will continue suffering until Rocco and Marco are sure that she’s learned her lesson, turning her into a humble bitch that will beg for cock on command.</em></p><p><em>Nickie was an undercover journalist. Now she’s just a trapped journalist, and the only story she’ll be covering is the story of her own enslavement…</em></p>",

    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>In the 9th century, Europe was just emerging from the fall of Rome. The Holy Roman Empire of Charlemagne was rising in the west, and it looked as though civilization might re-emerge from the strife and warfare of the barbarian hordes.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Until the Vikings came from the north.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Plunder and loot was the first and only thing on their minds. The undefended and unprotected people of the west were ripe for the plucking.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Viking longships ravaged both the coastlines and the river systems of Europe, their wanton destruction completely unchecked. Towns and monasteries were broken and ravaged and the remnants were put to the torch.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>The cowardly Vikings fled with each site’s most precious objects, especially their women...</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>In one particular village, there was a very spirited and rebellious girl. She tried to fight against the Vikings, but her efforts were in vain... they caught her, humilate her and even their female Viking leader, Adala, forced the girl to perform unnatural, lesbian acts. And they wrongly left her for dead beside the sea.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Many years would pass, and Adala wasted no time. She spread her reign of violence and terror far and wide, as far as water touched.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>But in her dominance she grew lazy and careless. It was only a matter of time until she was caught. A trap was set for Adala, and she and her crew were put to a brutal and violent death. The lord of these lands, Baron Victor, had anticipated her arrival, and to help him in his retaliation was a familiar face.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>It was the girl that Adala had hurt, violated, and humiliated so long ago!</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Baron Victor was a cruel and merciless man. He put each Viking man to the sword without even the pretense of trial. Each of the wild, hellion women was bound and brought back to his castle for a more “personal” inspection. To mark this great occasion, Lord Victor threw a feast for his most esteemed and noble guests, and for their dessert, he brought out the “main course,” a heavy helping of female Viking flesh!</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Each of the guests had their pick of the choicest parts and found each of the girls more delicious than they could’ve possibly imagined! Adala and her female companions were humiliated over and over by the disgusting and ruthless “guests” of Lord Victor.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>But the worst was yet to come. Flora didn’t want to participate in the night’s events. No, she wanted Adala all to herself.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Deep in the dungeons beneath the castle, Flora walked in and found the bound and helpless Viking mistress and her captive, female friends. Flora relished the sight of her former tormentor now tied up and completely unable to defend herself. Now, Flora could satisfy her thirst for vengeance in the cruelest and most painful way imaginable!</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>That is... if Lord Victor doesn’t have other plans...</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>In the Middle Ages, Mesta is one of the brightest beacons of light there is. In a world full of barbarism, warlords, and corrupt kings, Mesta is one of the few bastions of civilization and enlightenment. This has made it a prosperous and vibrant community as well as a target for those who would rather take than make. Mesta is ruled by the kind hearted and benevolent Lord Timothy Edgeworth, a man whose generosity is matched only by his fierce skill in battle. It is through his martial prowess that Mesta has survived as long as it has.</em></p><p><em>Unfortunately for the town and its inhabitants, Lord Fredrick II has laid his eye on their city. Lord Fredrick is a cruel and ruthless man with many a campaign season under his belt. He has laid waste to field and farmhouse, citadel and castle, and he is determined to bring Mesta under his control. The two great lords face off in a struggle of epic proportions. Many men, both good and evil, die above and below the wall, and the fighting is far from over.</em></p><p><em>Lord Edgeworth knows that his family is not safe. His beloved wife Evelyn and her stunning beauty is well known throughout the land, and even though his daughter is a fierce fighter, grown more accustomed to the bruises and scrapes of the sparring yard than the pleasantries and diplomacy of court, she is but one pretty girl amidst an army of cruel and sadistic men. Lord Edgeworth knows that this test of wills can end badly, and if Mesta falls, his family will not be spared.</em></p><p><em>He sends them off in a secret passage underground. This is his first mistake. The soldiers of Lord Fredrick have not been idle while they lost men and material on the walls of Mesta. They discovered this secret passage and a team of knights and men at arms have lain in wait for this exact moment.</em></p><p><em>Lady Evelyn and Lady Delia are captured and taken prisoner. With any other lord, with any other nobleman, they might have expected reasonable accommodations accorded due to their status. With Lord Fredrick, they are treated worse than animals. If they had known what would happen to them in the army camp surrounding Mesta, the two might have slit their own throats rather than be taken prisoner! Lord Fredrick is not interested in ransom. Instead, he seeks revenge against Lord Edgeworth and his stubborn refusal to surrender. Lady Evelyn and Lady Delia will suffer the consequences of Lord Edgeworth’s actions... but whether they will survive those consequences is another matter.</em></p><p> </p>",

Uncut gives me a chance to explore stories and scenarios that I couldn’t do with my existing series. You could also think of it as the comics equivalent of a DVD movie’s special features. More than just a vehicle for new stories, this comic series will give you more insight into the work that happens behind the scenes whenever I make a new comic.</em></p><p><em>This first issue of Uncut features a “what if?” story that happens in between the story pages 2 and 3 of “Confiscated Twins 4: Love Thy Neighbor”. It’s an “alternate reality” story that takes place after the twins Sara and Raquel Bauer are captured trying to escape from sexual slavery and before they are brought back to their owner.</em></p><p><em>This issue also features drawings and sketches for the Twins series that I ended up not using in the published comics, including notes describing each one. I plan to include more unpublished sketches in future issues.</em></p><p><em>Best regards,</em><br /><em> Fernando </em></p>",

Denise’s hot, tight cunt is one of those perks, and she’s going to be providing her fellow prisoner with rough, painful sex.

She’s the desire of every jock on the football team, the secret fantasy of all the male teachers, and the pride of the varsity cheerleading squad. And she’s also the dread of every geek, nerd and outcast at the school.</em></p><p><em>Janie Collins is the queen, and there’s nothing she enjoys more than publically humiliating the unpopular and ugly students attending her school. But Janie is about to push one geek just a little too far.</em></p><p><em>Marvin tries asking Janie Collins out to the senior prom, and she makes the mistake of refusing him in the most humiliating way possible.</em></p><p><em>Janie is about to find out that cruelty is a game that two people can play and it’s a game that Marvin is exceptionally good at. Being a member of the A/V club and a budding engineer, Marvin is good at building and electronics and he’s going to take his frustrations out on Janie’s hot, tight body.</em></p><p><em>She’s a whore and a slut, Marvin knows this. She may scream as his dildo-drill stretches and pummels her tight cunt, but the juices pooling between her thighs tells a different story. He’ll rip a few orgasms out of the bitch and then it’ll be time for a little well deserved payback.</em></p><p><em>Whipping her tits while electricity flows through her tender pussy lips soon has her begging to fuck his cock, but that won’t stop her suffering. She called his cock tiny when she was Janie Collins, queen of John Wilson High, but now she’ll scream for him to stop as he fucks her ass open again and again.</em></p><p><em>She is no longer Janie Collins, she’s just a dog. Less than a dog, she is simply a hunk of meat there to please cocks and suffer for their amusement.</em></p><p><em>She’s a beauty that finds herself in the hands of a geek, and she’ll never make fun of geeks after this…</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Hello there, officer! Mighty strange seeing one of you city folks up here. Now don’t you look fine and chipper in that nice uniformy get up and them fancy motorized wheels? Mind helping yourself to some of my fried fritters and powerful strong liquor? No? Well, suit yourself. Now what is it you got a mind for, coming all the way out here? Don’t see much of your kind in these parts. Most of us hill folk, we keep to ourselves, never mind bothering with them latest fashions or high falooting trends. Ain’t got much value out here where there ain’t no “cell phone reception” or “wi-fi connection.” Heck, I hear them satellites can’t see too good through the thick tree cover. Is that why you’re here?</em></p><p><em> What’s that? What’d you say? Two pretty girls gone missing? Why that’s a powerful shame. What’s their names? Megan and Madison? A blonde and a brunette gone biking in these here deep woods and ain’t been seen? Why no, officer. I ain’t seen nobody matching your description, though these old, hillbilly eyes might not mind a pretty sight like that, all juicy and precious and all. I hopes you catch my drift, but we got some queer folks that live in these places. Some powerful, unnatural types that never wandered out of old Appalachia since the war. No, not that war, earlier than that. Even earlier than that. Yessum. Abouts that old. </em></p><p><em> I tells you, I ain’t seen nobody matching your description of this here “Megan” or that there “Madison.” What kind of a female name is Madison, anyway? Sounds more like some uppity president than anything else! I tells you, we hill folk keep to ourselves. Even if anyone like that was to come, ain’t no way anybody else would tell you anything different! Now, if I was to speculate what might happen if one of them prettified, city girls were to come into the clutches of some of the meaner, ornerier types around here, it done send chills up and down my spine...</em></p><p><em>I imagine they’d be used over and over again. Some of them freaks out in the deep backcountry got some powerful growth in all the wrong places. Not sure those soft and pampered girlies would survive a hard fucking from some enormous giant with a big ole freaky, inbred willy!</em></p><p><em> If one of them girlies of yours was stronger than the other, I figure she might try to rescue her friend. Big mistake. We hill folk know these parts like the back of our hand. She might try to sneak in at night, but we got hearing that’d make an owl jealous. She might get caught too, and lordy lordy only knows what those inbred freaks might do to her too...</em></p><p><em> Don’t let their looks fool you, officer. They’re powerful strong and got a powerful hunger, especially for fresh girly meat... they’re crafty and sneaky too, full of tricks and thoughts that a more civilized mind might think perverted and insane!

Darker things have happened.</em></p><p><em> No telling what those deep hill folks might do to a pair of pretty girls like that. Might use them as breeding sows to ensure the family line, or they might get some queer notions in their head, see about fixing them a nice, hearty meal of bitch stew...</em></p><p><em> Of course, this is all speculation you understand there, officer.

I wish you best of luck there, youngin’ if you’re thinking of trying. These hills are rough on a soul, and ain’t no fancy, dandy machine of yours gonna make it over them hilly country.</em></p><p><em> Yessir, you have a nice day too.

    "description": "<p><em>CIA Report 0921473854</em></p><p><em>INTRODUCTION– A Miss Julie Sanders, star reporter for the International Gazette decided to do a feature on war crimes and atrocities, focusing specifically on a country in Southeastern Asia. Arrogant and brash, Miss Sanders decided that the best way to gain an in-depth and true expose concerning the situation on the ground was to go in without government support or notifying anyone of her plans. With only a single, female bodyguard to protect her (as no male bodyguards would dare associate themselves with a white, foreign woman), Miss Julie Sanders headed out into the jungle hoping to document the varied and multifaceted atrocities she witnessed deep in the jungle, far beyond the reach of roads, television cameras... or outside aid.</em></p><p><em>With the help of a Miss Taniya Sarducci, a native female bodyguard familiar with the area, Miss Julie Sanders stumbled across an army group of soldiers brutalizing the local population. Stealing the villagers rice, terrorizing its inhabitants, and performing illegal, intimidation techniques, Miss Julie Sanders was shocked at the sheer, shameless war crimes being performed right in front of her face! We believe that Miss Julie Sanders was so focused on gaining the perfect scoop that would propel her into journalistic stardom that she failed to realize that her movements were being noticed, and the army soldiers did NOT appreciate a white, foreign female barging into their country uninvited.</em></p><p><em>The soldiers find Miss Julie Sanders and Taniya Sarducci. Although the girls put up a fight, they are no match for these vicious soldiers of the regime. The girls are quickly taken captive and brought to a secret army camp, deep in the jungle and far from the prying eyes of American drones or satellites, so that they can be “interrogated” for information. Although Miss Julie Sanders believed she was protecting herself by informing nobody of her visit to the country, her actions ultimately worked against her... condemning her to a life of torment, abuse, and sexual slavery!</em></p><p><em>KEY FINDINGS –After being taken captive, Miss Julie Sanders is forced to endure the most hideous and shocking torment and humiliation imaginable! It is believed that Miss Julie Sanders and her companion were forced to engage in degrading and demeaning behavior, under pain of death... by fucking! The girls were made to satisfy the soldiers in every way imaginable, some undeniably war crimes of immense magnitude. The girls were made to suck cock, take dicks up their ass and between their legs, and admit that they were lesbian sluts and foreign spies! Miss Julie Sanders and Miss Taniya Sarducci were violated and debased in every way possible, but that was only the beginning of their suffering. The local government paid no heed to the Geneva Conventions or the International Court of Justice. Instead, the soldiers were given free rein to do whatever they pleased to these soft and helpless girls. They had let their imaginations run wild on many native village girls they’d caught on raids and “surprise inspections” throughout the country, kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery under false pretenses. But with a foreign, white girl, especially a spirited and feisty white girl from America, they could let their darkest and cruelest sexual fantasies come to life.</em></p><p><em>Miss Julie Sanders is beaten, abused, and used. She is forced to say many humiliating and disgusting things in order to save her own neck! But for every inch of submission she gives to her captors, it only drives them wilder and makes them want to abuse her more!</em></p><p><em>Poor Miss Taniya Sarducci fares no better. She is considered a “traitor” to the cause. Her fate is even worse than Julie Sanders! At least as a prized white slave, Julie Sanders’ safety is taken into consideration – she will sell for more on the slave markets of Asia! But Taniya... Taniya is sentenced to death... by fucking!</em></p><p><em>CONCLUSION – It is believed that without immediate assistance, Miss Julie Sanders’ life and sanity are in immediate peril! Miss Julie Sanders is being held by the cruelest and most sadistic minds on the planet, and unless something is done, she will be...</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Julie and Jessie are two new college freshmen, each hoping to land a big modeling career and looking to have fun on the town.</em></p><p><em> Jessie convinces her friend, Julie, to loosen up a bit and try to relax. College is where they can party and pick up hot, young boys.</em></p><p><em>The two of them head to the latest party to try to score big social points when a mysterious and handsome stranger comes up to them on the dance floor. His name is Sylvester Weinstock, and he’s a star agent of the Top Model Agency!</em></p><p><em>The girls have caught his eye. Sinister Sylvester tells the girls that he thinks they are perfect and that they’ll quickly skyrocket to become world-famous models. However, he also tells them that they have to act fast, or else they might miss their chance.</em></p><p><em>Poor Julie and Jessie probably wish they’d never met Sylvester!</em></p><p><em>Julie and Jessie board the first overnight flight to Los Angeles as quickly as possible.</em></p><p><em> Sylvester meets them at the airport with a shady looking limousine driver, but the girls are so thrilled at the limousine that they don’t notice that the driver looks kinda shifty and smells kinda bad.</em></p><p><em>But who cares!</em></p><p><em>They’re going to become world famous models! The driver takes their bags, and the girls climb into the limousine, and Sylvester closes the door behind them.</em></p><p><em>The girls are so excited to be in the big city, but they don’t know what the big city is. The limousine isn’t taking them to the high rises where modeling agencies usually are. It seems to be driving out to the suburbs, away from prying eyes.</em></p><p><em>When Sylvester gets a phone call, the situation only gets weirder! What is he talking about? Buyers in Mexico? Pussies, tits, asses, and legs? How rude!</em></p><p><em>But things only get worse from there. Sylvester manhandles the girls, making sure that their “goods are intact.”</em></p><p><em>The girls fight against him, but they’re completely helpless against his brute strength.</em></p><p><em>Soon they realize they’ve made a big mistake, and it’s a mistake that they will soon regret!</em></p><p><em>They’re driven to a farmhouse on the outskirts of town, and there they meet the big, fat, and ugly Mistress Penelope, a sadistic lesbian dominatrix whose perverse cruelty is only matched by her awful smell!</em></p><p><em>Even more terrifying, there’s an enormous bear of a man who goes by the name of Mickey, and he’s not only a violent, degenerate freak, but he’s hung like a bull elephant! His specialty is breaking pretty young girls, especially virgins.</em></p><p><em>For the girls, and especially for young and innocent Julie and Jessie, the farmhouse seems like a living hell.</em></p><p><em>Things couldn’t possibly get any worse, but neither Julie nor Jessie know how cunning and disgusting their captors are: Mistress Penelope violates all sense of privacy and decency and goes through Julie’s personal belongings.</em></p><p><em>It seems that Julie has a gorgeous, blonde cousin who also dreams of becoming a model! Jackpot!</em></p><p><em>But the most terrifying thing of all is that the sadists keep talking about some “party” that’ll be coming up in the next three days... Their captors sneer and grin. “You’ll have fun at our party! They really like pretty young girls like you!”</em></p><p><em>What could these cruel and depraved perverts have in store for the poor girls?</em></p><p><em>It can’t possibly be any worse than this hell...</em></p><p><em>Poor Julie and Jessie are in for the ride of their lives, and it won’t be one they’ll soon forget... or survive!</em></p><p><em> </em></p>",

The sick and fat old man has always been eyeing her ever since she went to live in his house, after her mother married the pervert, and Jenny has been sick of his clumsy advances and his lewd, disgusting eyes. She quickly leaves his mansion, but “daddy” tries to give Jenny a going away present. Jenny is not happy, and she quickly rebuffs him with a swift knee to the nuts!</em></p><p><em>When Jenny reaches New York City, she’s quickly snatched up by the prestigious lingerie company Victoria’s Sacred. There, she along with five other drop dead gorgeous models put on their first show at the luxurious Halton Hotel! Jenny and the other innocent girls, also recently turned 18, are so excited.</em></p><p><em>They’ve been told by their employer, a Madame Sabine, that there are big movie producers and directors in the audience. This might be their big break – their chance to get not only into the fashion industry but into Hollywood as well!</em></p><p><em>The girls are so excited, they fail to notice that something isn’t quite right about the members in the audience. Some of them are the typical fashion reporters – shy and pathetic losers who hide behind their cameras whenever anyone with a pretty face walks by, but there are some who are looking at the girls with a different kind of look – a predatory look that makes them feel uncomfortable.</em></p><p><em>Jenny notices a familiar face in the audience... an unwelcome face in the audience. Her sense of violation and disgust is overwhelming! What’s HE doing here?</em></p><p><em>The show is quickly concluded, and the girls are ushered into the bar of the Halton to give their potential Hollywood employers a more... personalized tour of their assets.</em></p><p><em>Most of the girls are tittering simpletons, completely unaware of the dark and sinister nature of their questions: “are these measurements correct?” “Tell me, have you ever had sex before?” “Do you like kissing girls?” For these young, naïve new models, fresh from their pampered and privileged lives, these questions are almost forgettable... though they do seem rather odd...</em></p><p><em>Jenny however gets some unwanted attention. She stands up for herself and slaps the rude and disrespectful man in the face! However, if she was expecting support from her employer, Madame Sabine, she is sorely disappointed when the enraged old dyke screams at her in the bathroom!</em></p><p><em>Things only get worse for Jenny and her fellow fresh faced models. They all pile into the van and head to the airport, excited at their future prospects! They don’t even notice the glass standing between their compartment and the driver. They don’t even notice the wicked black man driving their van with a look of vicious lust in his eyes. Before they even know what’s happening, it’s too late for any of them to stop it.</em></p><p><em>A vicious hell awaits the poor girls when they wake up! They’re paraded and humiliated on stage, but this is a different kind of stage than any of them was expecting!</em></p><p><em>Rather than getting catcalls on the catwalk, they’re being groped and molested by the smelliest, foulest, and nastiest fat men and disgustingly unnatural lesbian women while chained up and completely helpless! These Angels of Victoria’s Sacred have fallen from grace, and now they find themselves in the worst kind of place – sold as sex slaves to rich and powerful men and women who have no problems abusing and fucking the girls until they die!</em></p>",

These girls were spoiled rich kids with stunning good looks and sugar daddies willing to bow and scrape to their every whim and desire. They took a trip through the poor, impoverished African slums looking for a good time and a party that was off the rails. If these backward natives had a problem with that, they could go to hell! Brooke was here to have a good time, and nothing was going to stop her!</em></p><p><em>But one sad mistake landed the girls in the darkest depths of sexual hell! Tisha and Carly were caught in the vicious grips of the backwards natives and sentenced to lives of sexual slavery! Blonde, buxom Brooke managed to escape, but it’s hard to say that her fate was much better: Brooke finds herself the prisoner of a vicious, black African “massa” who forces the beautiful, blonde American girl to serve his every depraved and sadistic desire under pain of a vicious pussy flogging!</em></p><p><em>A strange act of kindness finds Brooke freed, but rather than finding safety and rescue, Brooke’s world only gets grimmer! The shabby bus driver finds Brooke and decides that he wants his own personal party, and Brooke will be the main attraction! The dark skinned weed smoker has his own sinister agenda for Brooke, and it does not include her freedom...</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile, Tisha and Carly are having their own problems. Sold into sexual slavery at the hands of an Arab sheik, their new robed master takes the poor, American girls out for a pleasure cruise on his ancient, Turkish galley. There, he hosts a very special party for some foreign dignitaries far out to sea into international waters, where the backwards, religious laws of the land do not apply. These latex clad lesbian beauties have their own sinister plan for poor Tisha and Carly, and it involves the most humiliating and depraved sexual activities that a straight girl can be forced to endure!</em></p><p><em>These rich mistresses have only one thing on their mind, the pain and suffering of their female slaves!</em></p><p><em>Tisha and Carly are forced to submit to their lesbian mistresses whether they want to or not! The screams of these helplessly bound girls only serve to excite and thrill their cruel mistresses! The Arab sheik watches, grinning and drooling lasciviously, his own rock hard cock visible beneath his white robes!</em></p><p><em>If these three American girls thought that their worst nightmares had come true, they hadn’t seen anything yet! The worst is about to come, and these girls are completely helpless to stop it! Perhaps it would’ve been better for them if they had learned how to be submissive, feminine sex dolls in college. These backwards, African natives have only one thing on their mind: break these girls, no matter what it takes! </em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>In the Age of Enlightenment, a time when civilization was expanding with science and democracy, there is a citadel deep in the heart of Europe that houses a sinister purpose and design. Called the Citadel of Desrochers, it is the domain of Duke Graff Martel, a strong willed man who earned his title not through lineage or pedigree but through strong armed political cunning. The king, a weak man, granted this man virtual autonomy within the kingdom to administer his lands and his estates as he saw fit. Unfortunately for the people of the land, Duke Graff Martel has only one goal on his mind: making money through the sale of tight, gorgeous noble women to the open slave market!</em></p><p><em>To do this, he has organized a secretive club known only as the BLACK RAVEN CLUB where the most perverted and sadistic of the European aristocracy gather in order to buy tight, white slave girls to use as they see fit! Lord Martel has many people interested in his wares, all the way from noble England to as far off as distant India, and he has no shortage of girls to sell.</em></p><p><em>Because of this, Lord Graff Martel likes to keep the choicest slave girls for his own, personal use. He has so many pampered and simpering girls at his disposal, that he has come up with some... interesting uses for them...</em></p><p><em>Why use a feather bed when a bed of slaves works just as well? Torment beautiful, pampered young women while having a good night’s sleep?</em></p><p><em>Sit upon a throne of girls, bought from impoverished lesser houses or won in open (and not so open) battle?</em></p><p><em>Or even better... use these girls as silverware...</em></p><p><em>There is no shortage of ideas that the despicable Lord Graff Martel has for his excess stock. But still, none of them compare to the newest arrival... the lady Anne Kingsley...</em></p><p><em>Purchased to help pay off her spendthrift husband’s gambling debts, the Lady Anne Kingsley is one of the choicest girls to come into the citadel of Desrochers in a long time. She is incredibly gorgeous, and her holes are incredibly tight. Lady Natalie, Lord Martel’s sadistic, lesbian mistress, personally inspects Lady Anne to ensure that she is fit and healthy and worthy of gracing Lord Martel’s firm, throbbing member. Lady Natalie inspects Lady Anne in ways that are both humiliating and invasive...</em></p><p><em>But that’s not all. Lord Martel knows that each girl that comes to his doorstep is always spirited and willful, used to being served and respected as members of court and stature. It is his job, no, his personal pleasure to disavow them of these illusions. They are, after all, useless cows only fit for one purpose: to please a man with every inch of their flesh!</em></p><p><em>Lord Graff Martel will take his time with the Lady Anne Kingsley and make sure she is well aware of her place... whether she will survive her “lessons”... well, that’s another story...</em></p><p> </p>",

William was a strong and proud member of the noble houses, and he could not abide the notion of his beloved sister being enslaved to some lowborn musclehead risen from the dirt. Although William’s heart is in the right place, his aim is not. The Duke did not gain his position by being a weak man. His honor earned in the various wars of the kingdom, he was a fierce fighter, and he took out the haughty William quickly and easily...</em></p><p><em>The one thing that the Duke hates more than spirited, fiery bitches are ungrateful bitches who aren’t pleased with their life as dick munchers and cum guzzlers! The Duke is intent on making sure that his pet learns her place.</em></p><p><em>She will suffer for her crimes with every part of her body. The inner circle of the Black Raven Club is even more violent and sadistic than its regular members, and the Duke has no qualms about Anne’s comfort or her safety...</em></p><p><em>And William will learn his own place as well. Duke Graff Martel has a dominatrix at his disposal, the Lady Natalie, and the only thing the Lady Natalie likes more than taming strong willed females is turning arrogant lordlings into obedient boytoys...</em></p><p><em>William will soon learn that he’s no match for the real world. Lady Natalie will turn William from a strong and powerful man into a quivering dick of a slave!</em></p><p><em>But these are just the appetizer to a larger entrée of pain and sexual sadism! Duke Graff Martel and Lady Natalie have darker, more perverted plans for their newest playmates...</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Anne, Elizabeth, and Mary were innocent, young beauties working in a dingy tavern on some colonial island in the middle of the sea. Or maybe they weren’t as “innocent” as first thought... These girls loved to prey on the lonely hearts of sea shackled men. Full of empty promises and teasing necklines, the girls would happily take each sailor’s gold and leave them with nothing but blue balls! With their cache of gold, the girls planned to sail off to bigger heists...</em></p><p><em>Unfortunately for them, their thieving ways finally catch up with them when they rob the crew of the notorious Black Cock the Pirate! The pirates want their gold back... or else! Unfortunately, the girls are not cooperative. Arrogant females used to being obeyed, they quickly talk back to the dirty, stinking, unshaven pirates, telling the pirates to piss off!</em></p><p><em>It does not end well for them... and it is unfortunate, for the dainty, delicate females!</em></p><p><em>Soon, Anne, Elizabeth, and Mary are forced into a life of high seas servitude and sexual slavery! These haughty beauties are quickly taught that they are nothing more than fuckmeat to be used however the crew desires! These lovelies are forced to do some of the most depraved and wicked things that a blue balled pirate, stuck for months at sea without a single fetching female to fuck, can imagine! Things soon become worse for the snatched snatch when they find out the ship is bound for the east and the markets of Arabia and China... those foreign devils have even more perverse and maniacal desires, and there’s nothing better to satisfy foreign lusts than helpless, haughty female meat!</em></p><p><em>That is... if they survive the crew first!</em></p>",

When it was time for her to arrive for her birthday party, she mysteriously failed to show up. When her parents went up to investigate, imagine their surprise to find their innocent, devout daughter not ready for the party but instead having her own perverse party... by playing with her pussy!</em></p><p><em>Shocked and disgusted by their daughter’s behavior, the strict, Christian parents punish her in the only way they know how: violently and shamelessly!</em></p><p><em>When this fails to quell her behavior, she is sent to a secluded boarding school, Heaven’s Manor, to cure her of her sinful, slutty ways. Unfortunately for the poor girl, the headmaster of the school, Father Roccasius, is not what he appears to be.</em></p><p><em>Rather than being a compassionate priest and guiding hand, he’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing: he takes the girls and forces them into sexual slavery, sold to the highest bidder!</em></p><p><em>Angela enters a hellish, nightmare world of strict bondage discipline and sadistic, sexual sadism! Her parents, sheltered and pious as they were, could not have prepared the innocent girl for this kind of disgusting, forsaken hellhole!</em></p><p><em>Angela has to escape... or things will get bad for her... very bad indeed...</em></p><p> </p>",

Writer Robinja and Artist Arieta are always trying new things, confounding audience expectations, and as a result, readers never know what to expect.</em></p><p><em>Following in the footsteps of the Erenisch comic series, the Bad Lieutenant Saga features a very strong, well-written story, in addition to amazing erotic artwork. The story moves seamlessly from extreme physical abuse, to complex emotional stories, to surprisingly funny moments and witty dialogue. All of it is held together by a film-noire inspired detective story.</em></p><p><em>This saga is truly something different.</em></p><p><em> A TRUE SLAVE'S DEVOTION KNOWS NO LIMIT…</em></p><p><em>Lieutenant Darinka O’Malley is a dirty cop. Despite being a decorated police detective, she is actually the secret slave of Serbian Mobster Vuk Draganovic. O’Malley has been the property of Vuk since she was a very little girl. And everything she has ever done, from training to be a detective, to making friends with people at work, was all secretly just so she could serve Vuk better. O’Malley thinks of her work life as just a “costume” that she has to wear.</em></p><p><em>Now the friendships that she’s built in her “costume” life are becoming important, and O’Malley will not hesitate to betray friends who have known her and trusted her for many years.</em></p><p><em>... SHE WILL HURT HER OLDEST FRIENDS, TO PLEASE HER MASTER</em></p><p><em>The daughter of Police Chief Collins has gone missing. Chief Collins naturally turns to his old friend Detective O’Malley to help him find her. But what Collins doesn’t know is that O’Malley is the one who kidnapped his daughter in the first place, and instead of helping him, O’Malley is going to throw off his investigation.</em></p><p><em>O’Malley has already helped enslave several of her friends. After years of carefully building up their trust and friendship, she turned them over to her Master to be abused and broken. She lives in an elaborate web of lies that she has spun to get people to drop their guard, and she strikes when they are most vulnerable.</em></p><p><em>She feels no guilt whatsoever for hurting so many people who trust her. Her only goal in life is to be a good slave to her owner. Nothing else matters.</em></p><p><em>She is a slave. She will do her duty.</em></p><p><em>PREPARE FOR A COMIC THAT TRULY IS LIKE NO OTHER!</em></p><p><em>With each issue, writer Robinja and artist Arieta prove that their skills are growing. This series truly does keep getting better and better. Robinja and Arieta continue to prove that <ins cite=\"mailto:Elizabeth%20Jovanovich\">BDSM</ins> comics can be erotic and sexy, while still having complex, well-written stories.</em></p><p><em>This comic features many scenes of sex and abuse of multiple women, as well as permanent mutilation, and life-long enslavement.</em></p>",
