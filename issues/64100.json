    "description": "<p><i>It will prove to be one of Batman's most challenging adventures as a new hero joins the Dark Knight's continuing cast of characters in BATMAN: SWORD OF AZRAEL. Azrael is the enforcer for the secret Order of Saint Dumas, a society whose existence dates back to the time of the Crusades. When this bullet-riddled angel of death crashes into the midst of a Gotham City parade, Batman is drawn into the mystery of Azrael, launching them on a quest that leads both Batman and the young Azrael to Europe where they separately investigate the systematic slaying of the members of the Order of Saint Dumas.</i></p><p>A man clothed in Medieval garb who identifies himself as \"Azrael\" attacks a man by the name of LeHah with a flaming sword, claiming the latter guilty of being a \"liar\", a \"traitor\", and a \"defiler\". LeHah, however, shoots the assailant with Teflon-coated bullets that bypass his bulletproof costume. Though Azrael is able to scar LeHah with his sword, he is ultimately overpowered by LeHah's bodyguards and is shot multiple times, sending him tumbling out of LeHah's penthouse and into the streets of Gotham, disturbing Gotham City's annual Founder's Day parade.</p><p>In the ensuing chaos, Azrael is able to commandeer one of the parade's horses, and makes his way to the home of his son, a blond, bespectacled university student. As he does so, the dying man strips himself of his costume, explaining to his son that \"Azrael\" must be kept a secret. He further requests that no doctors are to be called for him, and his corpse must be stripped bare and left for strangers to find. Lastly, he tells his son to open a package that he had left for him earlier, stating that it contains \"what you will need\", and urges his son to not fail where he, his father, had. Seconds later, the man dies.</p><p>Bruce Wayne, meanwhile, has taken an interest in the \"Vanishing Angels and Sudden Death\" that had disturbed the Founder's Day parade - especially since the penthouse of Carlton LeHah, an arms trafficker with no recorded past, was right above the scene when it started. As he changes into his Batman garb, Bruce states to Alfred that police had discovered a bulletproof vest - part of Azrael's costume - near the scene of the parade, and goes on to mention that the vest had been riddled with bloody bullet holes. The Caped Crusader wonders aloud how much willpower it would take for a man to keep himself alive, let alone conscious, with so many injuries.</p><p>As time passes, the university student obeys his father's wishes, and finds in the package a telephone number, forty thousand dollars in cash, and a letter instructing him to fly to a small airfield in Switzerland. After calling the number, and summoning two mysterious men that remove his father's corpse, the university student obeys the letter's instructions, and meets a man at the airfield who drives him to a small village. It is at the village that the student meets a dwarf by the name of Nomoz, as well as a giant named Heinrich. Nomoz explains that he is a teacher of \"The System\", and goes on to mention that the student's dead father was a member of a secret organization that dates back to the Fourteenth Century - an organization that he and Heinrich will prepare the student to join.</p><p>Back in Gotham, Batman continues to investigate LeHah's penthouse, and places a special laser microphone outside the window. Soon enough, the microphone picks up details of an arms exchange between LeHah and a man named Lescault that is to take place in a Swiss village known as \"Lucerno\". At said village, Nomoz shows the university student a medallion bearing an intricate design - the symbol of the Order of Saint Dumas, which, according to him, will turn the student into a \"bringer of death\". In the meantime, Commissioner Gordon meets with Batman, and informs him that witnesses claim the \"Vanishing Angel\" at the parade has held a sword when he entered an alley, only to come out of said alley empty-handed. The Caped Crusader investigates the alley in question, and finds Azrael's discarded sword on the steps of a cellar - a sword that bears the symbol of the Order on its hilt.</p><p>Little does the Batman know, however, that an ocean away, Nomoz is using the same symbol to put the university student through a brainwashing process to transform him into the next Azrael. When the student awakens, he is able to subdue Heinrich in a fight without even consciously thinking. Nomoz explains that the student's father had been utilizing hypnosis sessions on him since infancy - he already has all of the skills and knowledge to become Azrael within his subconscious; all that is left now is the physical training. Back in the Batcave, Bruce and Alfred learn of the symbol's origins from Barbara Gordon, AKA Oracle: the Order of Saint Dumas was a splinter group of the Knights Templar, who had continued the Crusades long after their \"official\" end, became wealthy from the loot they pillaged, and vanished by the Fifteenth Century - the prevailing theory being that they had retired to Switzerland to enjoy their riches.</p><p>As Nomoz continues to train the university student and informs him of the fact that his grandfather, great-grandfather, etc. had all been part of a long line of Azraels, Bruce Wayne and Alfred Pennyworth set course for Switzerland, determined to find the link between LeHah and the Order of Saint Dumas. The two eventually make it to the tiny village of Lucerno by helicopter, passing over the very chalet where Nomoz is training the next Azrael.</p><p>Just as the chopper prepares to land, however, LeHah fires an experimental missile launcher - the focus of his arms exchange with Lescault - at the chalet, destroying it in a burst of flame.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Batman has a dangerous encounter with the new Azrael, a new and important character making his debut in the Batman mythos with this miniseries, as the demon Biis wages a campaign of death against the Secret Order of Saint Dumas.</i></p><p><b>Continued from last issue.</b></p><p>As the chalet explodes from LeHah's attack, the helicopter containing Bruce and Alfred is sent crashing through the Swiss mountainside from the sheer force of the explosion. Though both men pass out for a few seconds, they survive the event largely unscathed. Bruce fills Alfred in on what happened, and correctly surmises that LeHah was behind the explosion. In the meantime, Nomoz and the university student are also revealed to have survived the explosion - the two had hidden in a small cellar beneath the chalet the moment that Nomoz had heard the suspicious sounds of the helicopter, for there was not supposed to have been any aircraft in the valley. In the meantime, Bruce constructs snowshoes for himself and Alfred with the crashed copter's metal rigging and branches from nearby pine trees, and the two men search for a way out of the valley.</p><p>LeHah, ultimately, is the worst off of the three parties - the explosion had triggered an avalanche on the mountainside, forcing him and Lescault to flee into their own helicopter. As the chopper became airborne, however, a stray stone from the avalanche had struck it, almost guaranteeing the death of the two men. As the helicopter tumbled through the avalanche, however, LeHah claimed to have seen the face outside the helicopter, belonging to \"Biis\". Moments after he had seen the face, the helicopter became level and still, and remained so for about a kilometer away from the avalance before responding to its damages.</p><p>Now alone in the wilderness of Switzerland, Lescault asks LeHah why the latter is telling him everything he himself had witnessed with his own eyes. LeHah states that he is not necessarily speaking to his partner; instead, he might be speaking to Biis, and indeed, the snow before the two men is blackened with a shadow resembling a demonic face. As Lescault concludes that LeHah has gone insane from the shock of their close escape, LeHah continues to \"communicate\" with Biis, thanking the entity for saving his life and pledging himself to the entity's services. As \"proof\" of his worthiness, the arms dealer then kills Lescault and leaves his body in the snow.</p><p>Bruce and Alfred, meanwhile, are still trapped in the valley, and the latter worries that they will not make it to civilization before nightfall. In order to give his friend better protection from the cold, Bruce gives Alfred his own parka, and changes into his Batman garb, complete with battery-operated heating filaments. Seconds later, the snowy ground before them erupts into a column of flame, and an enormous hovercraft emerges, which Batman immediately surmises is full of \"people with answers\". Nomoz and the university student, the occupants of the hovercraft, spot the Batman attempting to board, and Nomoz demands that he be stopped, over the student's protests.</p><p>The university student dons all the pieces of the Azrael costume his father once wore, and obeys his teacher's wishes, doing battle with the dark knight on the hovercraft's windshield. The two men quickly fall off of the craft, and continue to fight in the snow - once Batman realizes that Azrael will not listen to reason, he quickly begins to dominate the fight. Even Azrael's flaming sword proves no match for Batman, and Nomoz eventually calls a retreat, whisking Azrael away on the hovercraft and leaving the flaming sword behind. Batman and Alfred, unable to follow, choose to investigate the smoking ruins of the chalet, much to Nomoz's pleasure. The cellar beneath the chalet, after all, is stocked with enough explosives to wipe out all evidence of the Order of Saint Dumas - and in his hand is their detonator.</p><p>By now, LeHah has made it back to civilization after a long, hard trek through the subzero Swiss wilderness - a feat whose success he attributes to his \"protector\" Biis. The deranged arms merchant notes that he had made \"purchases\", and crafted a costume for himself to tout his support of Azrael's greatest foe: the Demon Lord Biis.</p><p>The Avenging Angel in question, meanwhile, has also made it to civilization with Nomoz, and is given the newest incarnation of the Azrael costume, complete with retractable flaming blades stored in the gauntlets, instead of an unwieldy separate sword. Nomoz goes on to explain that the Order of Saint Dumas has spent the last six centuries secretly using its wealth to establish charitable causes, and that it nurtures and protects its members - unless they defy the Order. LeHah, formerly the Order's treasurer, was such a man, and had looted the Order's Swiss Bank Accounts to build up his arms business. Azrael's father, the previous Azrael, was sent to punish LeHah, and failed in doing so - now his son must pick up where he left off.</p><p>At this time, a naked LeHah, his face painted deathly white in tribute to Lord Biis, speaks to his patron demon, and voices his intent to kill all of the Order's remaining members. According to LeHah, only a few dozen remain, spread out over Europe and the Americas, and once they are all dead, he and Biis will claim all of the Order's wealth for their own. Beneath the chalet in Switzerland, in the meantime, Bruce and Alfred continue to investigate the Order's secret bunker, obviously having avoided being blown to bits - a loose wire on the bomb in the bunker had prevented its detonation. As Alfred prepares food with the scant resources inside the bunker, Batman tinkers with a radio rig tuned to a relay satellite, intending to track the signal to find the rest of the Order's members and get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p>As dusk approaches, Nomoz and Azrael (the latter now no longer in his costume) leave their quarters, intending to search for LeHah. Nomoz has correctly deduced LeHah's plans, and adds that he had been unable to reach most of the Order's members; the only one he could contact had been a hospitalized man that lives the very city they are currently in. Even as they speak, however, LeHah is planning to assassinate the very same man, having successfully warned all the Order's other members (who are not aware of his betrayal) that their lives are in danger and they are not to contact anyone outside the Order. Many miles away, at the same time, Batman informs Alfred that he had used the radio and his many contacts as Bruce Wayne to track down all of the Order's members, and proceeds to radio for a rescue team to retrieve the two of them.</p><p>Nomoz and Azrael arrive at the hospital, but they are far too late - LeHah has already stormed in and slaughtered the hospital's staff, as well as the Order member. Nomoz demands that Azrael don his costume, but LeHah is quicker - with several rounds of gunfire, he sends the unarmored warrior flying out of the hospital window and into the streets below.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Captured, drugged, his identity as Batman revealed, Bruce Wayne fights a duel of wills with the demon Biis. Meanwhile, to track Biis across Europe, an uneasy alliance is born...between Azrael and Alfred!</i></p><p><b>Continued from last issue.</b></p><p>Bruce and Alfred arrive at the hospital just in time to witness the un-costumed and bullet-riddled Azrael falling out of the hospital window, and immediately rush to his aid. Bruce recognizes the youngster, and leaves Alfred behind to minister to him, while he himself plans to deal with the one responsible for the gunshots. The billionaire rushes into the hospital through the window that Azrael fell through without changing into his Batman outfit, noting that there are far too many witnesses around, and also that no one around knows of Bruce Wayne's persona as an air-headed playboy anyhow.</p><p>Right as Bruce makes it into the hospital, LeHah readies himself to kill Nomoz. His weapon jams at that moment, however, and the deranged arms dealer takes it as an order from Biis for him to retreat. Bruce pursues the fleeing LeHah, despite Nomoz (who insists that this is no business of his) attempting to trip him, and eventually comes to the hospital's storage room. LeHah, standing upon a tall shelf laden with pharmaceutical drugs, attempts to ambush Bruce by throwing a large jar of sedative at him. The ploy works, and Bruce is overcome enough by the fumes from the shattered jar to be unable to react quickly enough when LeHah pushes the entire shelf at him. The billionaire is crushed beneath the shelf and its dozens of chemicals, but musters enough willpower to emerge from the wreckage and charge LeHah.</p><p>Ultimately, however, the drug-weakened Bruce proves no match for LeHah, who easily overpowers him and knocks him into semi-unconsciousness. The deranged arms dealer than drags Bruce out of the hospital and into the ambulance that he himself had arrived at the hospital in, and, as he drives away, spots Alfred and Nomoz standing over Azrael's body. Before he can react, Bruce regains consciousness and attempts to escape, but LeHah subdues him again, overpowers Alfred when the Englishman attempts to assist his master, and drives off with the once-again unconscious billionaire. LeHah does not stop driving until he and his \"passenger\" are miles into the countryside, upon which point he awakens Bruce, injects him with a truth serum, and gloats over just how hopeless Bruce's situation is.</p><p>In the meantime, Alfred and Nomoz (with the Azrael in tow) drive toward another of the Order's safe houses, the dwarf holding a dagger at the throat of the butler out of suspicion. Alfred's suggestion that Azrael be given medical attention is shot down, upon which point he attempts to strike up a temporary alliance with Nomoz - the Order's members, he believes, will prove to be a great help in finding his master. Seconds later, Azrael reveals that he is alive - when LeHah had shot him, the gym bag containing the Azrael costume had been directly between his body and the bullets. The bulletproof fabric, folded many times over inside the bag, had shielded him from the bullets, preventing any of them from even penetrating his skin.</p><p>LeHah, meanwhile, is busy tormenting a helpless Bruce at the same hotel where he had first donned his costume, stating that he knows who Bruce Wayne is, and has discovered his dual identity as Batman by finding the costume beneath Bruce's street clothes. LeHah explains to Bruce why he had kept the latter alive: he plans to extract every bit of information that he can from Bruce, and take control of Wayne Enterprises and all of its wealth. Many miles away, Bruce's would-be rescue party faces dissension - namely, the fact that Nomoz is still not sufficiently convinced that Alfred should not be killed for knowing too much. Azrael protests the taking of an innocent life, but Alfred has a far better bargaining chip - he, after all, is in the employment of the World's Greatest Detective, a man who would easily be able to track down LeHah.</p><p>Even as the three plan their next move, LeHah has already entered the home of another of the Order's members, whom he slays with ease. LeHah then continues his interrogation of Bruce, intending to separate him from his many secrets. Bruce, however, calls upon the dozens of mind-control techniques he had learned during his youth - techniques he had used to discipline his mind in preparation for becoming the Batman - to resist the truth serum, much to his captor's fury. An enraged LeHah informs Bruce that if the latter possesses no useful information, he will be killed sooner than later.</p><p>Alfred, Nomoz, and Azrael learn of the LeHah's latest murder, and Azrael pieces together a pattern in LeHah's killings (much to displeasure of Nomoz, who insists that Azrael is meant to avenge, not think). The deranged arms dealer is apparently moving westward across Europe - the hospital murder had taken place in Geneva, Switzerland, and the second murder in Calais, France. Nomoz informs the party that, if this pattern hold true, then the next victim will be an Order member named Harcourt who lives in the English countryside, just outside of London.</p><p>Once again, LeHah proves quicker than the three, and arrives at Harcourt's estate sooner than they do. Harcourt blithely invites LeHah into his greenhouse, unaware of his true intentions, and LeHah dons Batman's cowl with a feral grin as soon as the old man's back is turned. In the meantime, Alfred's party arrives at the gates of Harcourt's estate, but are denied access by the guards. As Alfred unsuccessfully tries to bargain with the guards, Azrael dons his full garb and savagely subdues them, finally adopting the tone and role his father once had.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Azrael. Batman. The demon Biis...their three-way conflict ends in a fiery cataclysm beneath an oil refinery in the Southwestern USA. What emerges are two new allies, separated by a shadow of violence, bound by a shared secret...the identity of the man behind the Dark Knight's mask! The conclusion to this miniseries leads into Batman (1940) #488.</i></p><p><b>Continued from last issue.</b></p><p>Upon seeing Azrael attack their comrade, Harcourt's remaining guards charge the fiery angel, along with their attack dogs. Azrael completely slaughters the guards and the dogs alike with his flaming blades, much to Alfred's horror and Nomoz's approval. As Alfred wonders to himself how a shy, demure university student could suddenly turn into such a fierce killer upon putting on a mask, Azrael spots \"Batman\" inside Harcourt's greenhouse, in the act of murdering Harcourt himself. A dismayed Alfred immediately realizes that it is not Bruce Wayne inside the Bat-Suit, but Azrael crashes into the greenhouse without hesitation. Alas, the fiery angel is too late, and LeHah, having already successfully murdered Harcourt, escapes with the car that Alfred, Nomoz, and Azrael had ridden to the estate in the first place. Azrael attempts to stop LeHah by jumping onto the speeding car's roof, but is knocked off the car by the low-hanging branch of a tree beside the road.</p><p>As night falls, Azrael awakens from the trance that the costume has placed him in, and is severely reprimanded by Nomoz for allowing LeHah to escape. Alfred protests that the young man had understandably hesitated out of shock from seeing Harcourt's lifeless body, but Nomoz brushes the excuse aside, roaring that Azrael is nether \"decent\" nor \"humane\". Azrael himself brings a stop to the discussion, and the three work together to figure out the next place LeHah would have gone with the kidnapped Bruce: an abandoned oil refinery near Houston, Texas - the only piece of property owned by a member of the Order that resides in North America.</p><p>LeHah and Bruce are indeed within the oil refinery in question, the latter still clothed in the Bat-Suit belonging to the former. As LeHah prepares to torture Bruce some more with a red-hot knife, the bound billionaire mocks the deranged arms dealer, attempting to confuse him with questions concerning the \"demons\" that both of them serve. An enraged LeHah acknowledges that Biis is displeased by his wearing the heraldry of another, but adds that he will seek to please and pacify the Demon Lord with a sacrificial offering: Bruce's life. Bruce's ragtag \"rescue party\", in the meantime, has arrived just outside of the oil refinery, and as Nomoz commands Azrael to put on his mask and enter the trance once more, Alfred begs the youth to exercise restraint and not massacre everyone in his way like he did at Harcourt's mansion.</p><p>The youth sadly replies that he cannot think while in Azrael's guise; he can only act. A resigned Alfred then asks for the youth's name, to which he replies:</p><p><i>\"I... do not know. I have forgotten. I have forgotten who I am.\"</i></p><p>Azrael the dons the last piece of his costume, enters the trance, and tears the refinery's iron-mesh fence apart with his blades. Once inside the grounds, the party discovers a vehicle parked in front of a door - a highly suspicious fact for a supposedly abandoned refinery. The door in question, however, is made of steel too thick for Azrael's blades, and it is protected by an electronic lock whose one weakness is a power outage. As Nomoz prays to Saint Dumas for guidance, a once-again naked LeHah attempts to kill Bruce behind the door's other side, charging toward him with the knife.</p><p>Even with his arms bound, Bruce is able to stop LeHah's charge with a kick. This act of defiance buys him another few seconds, during which a bolt of lightning miraculously strikes the refinery, temporarily shorting out the power. LeHah ignores Bruce's taunting about whether the power outage could be a sign from Biis, picks up the knife, and charges the billionaire once more. Once again, Bruce thwarts his attempt with a kick, and LeHah gives up on the knife, optioning to simply shoot Bruce with his nine-millimeter pistol. Seconds before he pulls the trigger, however, Azrael crashes into the room, both of his blades deployed, and roars to LeHah the same words his father had.</p><p>In the ensuing battle, the little crude oil left within the refinery is set ablaze, trapping LeHah and the still-bound Bruce within a wall of flame. Alfred begs Azrael to save his master, but Nomoz insists that Azrael does not save, and orders the fiery angel to leave both men to burn. To Nomoz's surprise, Azrael indeed walks into the ring of flame to free Bruce, wrapping the weakened billionaire in the fireproof Bat-Suit and carrying him out himself when Bruce begins to lose consciousness. All of the men, save for LeHah, are able to escape the burning refinery right before it explodes.</p><p>Once outside, Nomoz roars to Azrael that the latter has disgraced his mission: he had disobeyed a direct command from his mentor. Azrael, however, takes off his mask and retorts:</p><p><i>\"I am not an angel. I am a man. My name is Jean Paul Valley. That was my father's name, too.\"</i></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>A Storm-centric annual issue! Preparing for her marriage to Black Panther, Storm must first right the wrongs of her past. Also, find out which X-Men got the invite to the “wedding of the century”!</em></p><p>This X-Men special features Storm as she faces the most important crossroads of her life! How does she react to T'Challa's proposal of marriage? How will it affect her role with the X-Men? Will she be able to lead two different lives at the same time. This leads into next month's BLACK PANTHER / STORM WEDDING!</p><p>A special prelude to the wedding of the century. In the beginning of the comic Storm is under alot of rubble of an African hotel that she and some other X-men were in. The other X-men escaped somehow but can't find Storm. They have to push their way through the war like city and are being fired on every side. Storm still in the rubble dreams about wheather she should marry T'Challa or not. In her dreams she is running from wild jackals the symbol of her inner struggle. People that have been close to Storm appear to try and help her, like Forge, Jean Gray, and Kitty. It's when she stops running and fighting the jackals we see the Panther Spirit get up and try to help her, which she stops. She stops him and tells him that IF she decides to marry T'Challa it will be as his equal and not otherwise. But back in the rubble children toy soilders find Storm's body. They are about to hurt her when she awakes and attacks. Later Storm and the other X-men meet up and attack the dictator in head of the attack on them, which turns out to be Storm's jealous Uncle. They later find out where to find Storm's grandmother and she tells Storm some things about her forgotten past.</p>",

Written by Frank Miller, with art by Todd McFarlane.</p><p>Batman travels to New York City, to investigate a series of brutal murders, who has apparently engaged in cutting the heads off of his victims. The killer, holds high tech weapons and equipment, and wants the brains of the homeless to operate his creations, thus the decapitations. When Batman meets Spawn, they mistake each other for the enemy, and engage in a series of battles, but upon realizing that they are after the same perpetrator, they work together operating on a strained relationship.</p><h2>Connection</h2><p>Though the book does not show evidence of appearing in Batman's nor Spawns main continuity, the book bridges a gap in Frank Miller's <a href=\"/dark-knight-universe/4015-56878/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56878\">Dark Knight Universe</a>, (previously know as <a href=\"/earth-31/4015-56469/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56469\">Earth-31</a>). It is believed that the book takes place somewhere in between <em>All Star Batman</em>, and <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>, but this is only speculation. There is speculation that a scar across Spawns face that shows in <a href=\"/spawn-22-the-hunt-pt-2/4000-39200/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-39200\"><em>Spawn #22</em></a>, is the result of a batarang thrown during a fight that the two engaged in. This is backed with evidence in the same issue with Spawn saying that he fought \"a bozo in black\".</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Pinup by Greg Capullo.</li><li>Pinup by Todd McFarlane and Frank Miller.</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The first of two SUPREME POWER specials!</p><p>“HUNTING THE ALIEN”</p><p>Now that the world knows his dark secret, Hyperion suddenly finds himself both alone and hunted. Four new super-powered individuals -- each based on a character from the original Squadron Supreme -- are after his hide, and they’ve got the will and means to take him down!</p><p>After the new team, which consists of Dr. Emil Burbank, Arcanna Jones, Nuke, and Shape, find Hyperion. Mark is not very pleased with the notion. Emil makes the team take Hyperion in with any force necessary.</p><p>Arcanna tries to find a quatum possibility which will render Mark harmless for a moment and at the same time, nuke fires off a blast a Hyperion. This event causes a strange event which Mark uses to escape. Arcanna feels uneasy about the quatum possibility.</p><p>Having failed to retrieve Mark, the team make their way home. As they cross a city, they discover an enormous crater which could only be created by a nuclear blast, but Nuke detects no radiation. Eventually, they see Hyperion in a new suite with a squadron of superheroes with him.</p><p>A random pedestrian explains how the world belongs to them now. How the world was torn with heroes fighting heroes, and now that group, is after Nighthawk.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Damon Lindelof, co-creator of the hit TV series Lost teams with superstar artist Leinil Francis Yu to bring their storytelling magic to a tale that will rock the Ultimate Universe! Dr. Bruce Banner has been presumed dead since his execution, following his murderous rampage through Manhattan as the Hulk. But when reports start cropping up of an unidentified creature appearing around the globe, Nick Fury begins to get worried. Not because Banner can turn from man to unstoppable monster in seconds...but because Banner's existence is the one secret that can bring down Fury. Fury turns to the only man he can trust: Wolverine. And he's only too glad to take care of Banner-by any means necessary.</em></p> <p>This is the first issue of a re-make of Wolverine's first appearance.</p> <p>It starts off by showing us a badly wounded Wolverine and a very shocking 2nd page, then the writer decided to \"Tarantino\" it and show us Wolverine meeting Nick Fury, Betty Ross and Jennifer Walters, during this time Nick Fury asks Wolverine if he could \"take out\" the Hulk quickly and quietly, when Nick offers Wolverine something in return he simply replied \"You said he's tough, it'll be fun\"</p> <p>Then they jump ahead to Tibet 4 hours before we find Wolverine, he is in a bar drinking and then he asks a local why their are no girls in this \"town\", the man replied \"I...... no speak....... english\"</p> <p>Then they jump to 91 minutes before we find Wolverine and he is in his \"suit\" and is following a man with these yaks, he eventually tracks him back to a mountain, with a really big door on the front, the man enters, shortly after Wolverine opens the massive door and finds a quite content Hulk with dozens and dozens of beautiful women lying on and around him, everyone including the girls look up and the man that had opened the door only to find a calm Wolverine who un-sheathes his claws and says \"Hi Bruce\"</p>",

    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After joining a nuclear protest group to impress his girl, Doreen Day, high school jock Ronnie Raymond realizes that they aren't just protesting - they're going to blow the Hudson Nuclear Power Plant sky high! He tries to stop them, seeing them plant dynamite near the nuclear reactor core, and they knock him out to take the blame for the disaster. Enter Professor Martin Stein, head of Hudson Nuclear, who again attempts to stop the protesters before it’s too late, meeting the same end as Ronnie. Just before the dynamite goes off, Ronnie reawakens to find the unconscious Professor next to him; while he attempts to flee with Martin, the bomb goes off, catching them both in a nuclear explosion. Their latent metagenes are activated, and they are fused together to form a single being. Ronnie finds that, because he was awake during the reaction and Martin asleep, he has control of the body, while the Professor is a passive observer who is only seen by Ronnie. They realize that they can alter the molecular structure of themselves and everything around them, and create a superhero identity for themselves: Firestorm, the Nuclear Man. As they fly off and bring the terrorists to justice, it is revealed that they were not alone in the accident: Stein’s scheming and dishonest aid, Danton Black, was also turned into a super-being by the explosion, but instead of joining together, he gets the opposite ability to split himself up into numerous, increasingly smaller versions of himself. He adopts the identity of Multiplex, and begins his life of crime as Firestorm’s arch-foe. Upon defeating the terrorists, Firestorm sees its own reflection, which causes Martin and Ronnie to split apart, frightened at the fact that their shared persona doesn’t look like either one of them. Unfortunately, after their split, Martin does not remember anything that happened during the merger.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><ins><strong>Firestorm826's Panel-by-Panel Story Summary (Spoiler Alert)</strong></ins></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Wowee! If the kids at school could only see me now!” cheers an exuberant Firestorm, “I haven’t felt this good since I made the winning touchdown in the Championship game with Central High!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Sense it: Something special is in the air tonight…Tonight, in the starlit winter sky of Manhattan, a hero is being born - - and he loves it!</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Firestorm soars happily over the Manhattan skyline. “Fan-taas-tic!” Firestorm yells, swooping low over a crowded street full of amazed citizens just below, “I can fly - - I can alter my own atoms - - I can even change things around me! Talk about a dream come true! I just wish I had all this this morning, when Cliff Carmichael was dumping on me! Man, I would’ve fixed his hash, all right…” A shocked woman points up at him, yelling, “That man - - he’s on fire!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Suddenly, a bystander distracted by Firestorm steps out into oncoming traffic. “Uh-oh! That guy down in the street, gawking at me! He’s gonna be creamed by that cab!” Firestorm cries out, “Unless…Heck, why not? I can alter atoms, right? One wave, and presto…No more cab!” Instantly, the speeding cab turns into a small flood of water that splashes harmlessly into the pedestrian, leaving the cabbie dumbfounded and still clutching the steering wheel. “Two tons of taxi into two tons of H<sub>2</sub>O! Neat trick’ if I say so myself!” Firestorm grins as he banks out towards the Statue of Liberty.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Harry, did you see that?” asks a shocked helicopter news reporter hovering near the statue. “One minute this flying joker was headed straight at our chopper,” he blurts to the pilot, “and the next minute, he flies right through us, like we’re not even here!” He cranes his arm outside the helicopter, trying to focus his TV camera onto Firestorm. “No problem, gents,” Firestorm calls down to them, “for a kid who can switch his atomic structure at will! The name’s Firestorm, gang, and in case you hadn’t guessed it - - I’m the world’s first Nuclear Man!</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A second voice speaks in Firestorm’s mind, a second persona that shares the Nuclear Man’s thoughts. “Very good, Ronald. You have tested your powers and found them adequate,” observes Professor Martin Stein, asking, “Time now to deal with more serious matters, agreed?”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie Raymond smiles and nods. “Right, Professor,” he answers, “For example, a first class jerk named Eddie Earhart - - that creep who made me what I am today! Not to mention almost killing me in the process!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Firestorm dives down close to the water and speeds toward New Jersey, kicking up a rooster tail wake in the waves behind him. “Here we are, Professor! Scenic south New Jersey…and the spanking new Brooks Nuclear Power Plant!” Ronnie announces, “Judging by that ripped fencing - - Eddie and his gang have already arrived, just as they said they would! Punctual bunch of crazies, aren’t they?” Ronnie eyes the plant’s exterior wall. “Let’s see, if I could fly through a helicopter - - ten feet of concrete should be a cinch!” Firestorm lowers his atomic density and passes right through the wall! “And it is!” Ronnie yells happily. “Be careful, Ronald!” Stein cautions. Ronnie answers, “The tag’s Firestorm, Professor - - for both of us, now!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Eddie Earhart and his gang are startled by the sudden and unexpected arrival of Firestorm. Several are in the process of setting up dynamite charges. “Eddie! Look!” a thug yells, “Some freak - - makin’ like a bird!” Firestorm flies in above them, calling out, “Hold that thought, you bozo - - and drop that dynamite!” Eddie glares at Firestorm. “Whoever he is, we can’t let him stop us blowin’ up this plant!” Eddie yells, barking at his henchmen, “Use your guns - - kill ‘im!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A moment frozen in time: the shouted command is like a sword cutting through the hero’s bravado - - slicing thought and flesh, and laying bare the bone of memory. Suddenly, this game has become deadly, and in shock, Firestorm’s mind jumps back to another game twelve hours before…less dangerous, perhaps, but to Firestorm, no less meaningful…</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie runs across a snowy school field in a game of pick-up football. “Hey, kid! The ball - - grab the ball!” a teammate yells to him. Ronnie looks back to find a long pass soaring right towards him. “No way! It’s coming in too fast!” cries a defender, “He’ll fudge it - - he’s got to!” Ronnie sprints and dives, leaping into the air…and catches the pass for a touchdown! “Wanna bet?” yells his teammate, “It’s a touchdown! We win!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">On the sidelines, the pretty Doreen Day has taken notice. “Cliff, he’s just marvelous!” she gushes with a smile, “The way he leaped for that ball - - he almost seemed to stretch those last few inches!” Doreen’s friend, Cliff Carmichael is unimpressed. “Come on, Doreen, be serious!” he scoffs, “How can you be interested in a common jock when you’ve got me?” Doreen watches Ronnie intently, answering, “Guess.”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie runs back to midfield to join the team. Doreen walks out to meet him. “You’re the new transfer student, aren’t you?” she asks, “I’m Doreen Day…I saw you during homeroom.” Ronnie answers, “Uh, hi. I’m Ronnie Raymond.” Doreen nods, replying, “I know. I peeked at the seating chart.” Ronnie smiles with a little bit of surprise. “Yeah?” he asks, taking a much closer look at Doreen this time. “Uh-hmm,” Doreen grins back.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Say hero, that was some catch! Two bits says you can’t do it again while chewing gum!” sneers Cliff. Ronnie whips his head around to look. “Is that a wisecrack?” he asks, a little annoyed. “You figured that out? Brilliant!” Cliff answers sarcastically. Doreen shakes her head. “Cliff! For Heaven’s sake!” she sighs. Cliff walks close to Ronnie. “Doreen isn’t the only one who checked you out after homeroom, Raymond,” Cliff taunts, “I’ve seen your transcript. You’re a true Albert Einstein. Tell me - - is it true that your newspaper reporter Dad yanked you from your last school ‘cause you flunked spelling your own name?”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie loses his cool and flings the football into the snow in frustration. “Listen, big mouth,” he snarls at Cliff, “I don’t know who you are or why you’re riding me - - but one more dig and I’ll turn your glasses into contact lenses.” He curls his hand into a fist, waving it near Cliff’s face. Cliff calmly bends down to pick up the football. “Ah, yes, the threat of violence! A typical reaction of the intellectual primitive,” Cliff gloats. “As for who I am, Einstein - - ask around,” he says smugly, “Everyone knows Clifford Carmichael. I’m the class whiz kid. Cross me at your own risk - - Butterfingers!” Cliff whips the football at Ronnie, and it strikes him hard on the chest. “Hey!” Ronnie cries out as the football bounces off of him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">If you’ve ever been insulted without reason, then you know how Ronnie Raymond feels now…Believe us, it’s going to get worse! “All right, class, when was Charles the First of England beheaded?” asks Mr. Taubman, the history teacher. Ronnie starts to raise his hand, thinking, “Easy! That was in…” Cliff bolts his hand up, blurting out, “1649, Mr. Taubman! By an Act of British Parliament!” Ronnie looks over his shoulder quickly at Cliff. “Huh? He jumped me on purpose!” Ronnie fumes.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Excellent, Clifford!” nods Mr. Taubman, asking, “And who replaced the dead King?” Ronnie starts to raise his hand again, thinking, “A cinch! I read that last year back in…” Cliff thrusts his hand up, calling out, “Charles the Second, Mr. Taubman - - during the Restoration in 1660!” Mr. Taubman walks over near Ronnie’s desk. “Very good, Clifford,” he replies, asking, “Now, who was Oliver Cromwell an…” Ronnie blasts his hand up, yelling out, “I know, Mr. Taubman!” The history teacher is surprised. “Eh?” he says as he gives Ronnie a sideways glance.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Young man, this is not a football field! There’s no need for shouting or rudeness,” Mr. Taubman chides Ronnie, adding, “Perhaps you were a star player on your team in your last school, but here, what counts is academic achievement!” He turns to the gloating Cliff, asking, “Clifford, will you answer the question please?” Ronnie hangs his head and groans in frustration, “Arrgggh!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Who is this kid named Ronnie Raymond, you ask - - and why is he important to Firestorm? Wait and see, dear reader…</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“I hardly know Carmichael, Doreen - -so why is he dumping on me?” Ronnie asks. He and Doreen carry their lunch trays through the cafeteria. “Jealousy?” Doreen suggests as they find a table and take their seats. “Of me? A guy who barely gets a ‘B-‘ average? Why should he be jealous?” Ronnie asks. Doreen smiles at him, asking, “Really, do you care, Ronnie?” He thinks for a moment, answering, “Nah, I guess not…”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie looks over his shoulder and sees Cliff watching him. “Liar! Who wants to look like a dummy in front of a smart lady like Doreen?” Ronnie asks himself, “Cliff made me look stupid and that burns me…” Cliff calls out to Ronnie in a loud voice. “Well, whaddya know! Raymond can chew and cut meat at the same time! A-maz-ing!” he teases with a grin. Ronnie grows steamed, yelling back, “Carmichael, I warned you!” He stands and whips around to face Cliff and….CRASH!</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Oh, no!” Ronnie gasps as hand splatters his lunch all over Doreen! “Man, have I blown it! Spilling my lunch all over Doreen!” he frets to himself nervously. “Doreen, I’m - - I’m sorry! I guess Carmichael’s right - - I am a moron!” he groans in embarrassment, abruptly turning and sprinting for the nearest exit.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Doreen stands up as milk and food run down her shirt. She stomps angrily over to Cliff, pointing and snarling, “Clifford, for a boy with a genius I.Q., you act like you’ve got the wits of a retarded oyster!” Cliff laughs with glee. “But I don’t look like a human lunchpail, Doreen dear!” he chortles, “Look at you! You’re as bad as he is!” Doreen scowls and yells, “Carmichael…You die!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile, outside… “I hoped I could find friends in this school, now that Dad’s promised to settle down at his new newspaper job,” Ronnie worries to himself as he steps outside into the school courtyard. “We were always moving from city to city before - - I never had a chance to make friends before we moved again!” Ronnie thinks. He closes his eyes for a moment’s peace. “But after today, how can I ever get people to like me?” he wonders dejectedly, “First grandstanding at that football game…then getting a teacher angry…and now, messing up my chances with a really neat girl! Raymond, you are a real loser!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">And, as a depressed Ronnie Raymond wanders the school grounds waiting for lunch period to end…worried eyes watch him from the offices of the school principal, Dr. Wallace Hapgood:</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Principal takes a puff on his pipe. He rests a hand on the window ledge as he watches Ronnie. “Ed Raymond is an old friend, but his son has me concerned,” Hapgood thinks, “He seems such a tense young man. Perhaps I’ll have a talk with him…”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">But Ronnie isn’t the only member of our cast vitally connected to Firestorm…At the new experimental Hudson Nuclear Power Plant, we’ll find another character equally crucial to our hero…the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who designed and built this installation - - Professor Martin Stein:</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Finished, after all these months…and years…it’s finally done,” Professor Stein smiles with pride. “Tomorrow the Governor arrives for the oh-so-necessary political ceremonies - - but as far as this man is concerned, the plant is ready for operation now - - today!” he thinks. He punches up a security camera monitor on a control panel, and his screen displays images of an anti-nuclear power demonstration going on outside. “The world’s first fully automated fail-safe nuclear generating plant - - quite an achievement,” he thinks as he watches, “not that those young protesters out there would admit it, even if they understood it. I don’t blame them for their fears, however, many nuclear plants are unsafe - - but not this one. This building has more backup computer controls than Washington has bureaucrats, and how much more secure can…eh?”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Suddenly, the control room door slams open and three men walk in swiftly. “Black! What the devil are you doing here?” Stein exclaims as he whirls around to look. “Protecting my rights, Stein,” Danton Black growls back. “Your rights? What…?” Stein asks confusedly. Black glares at him, gritting his teeth. “Danton Black is no man’s fool, Stein!” he explains, “When I worked as your assistant, you stole my plans for this plant…” Stein is outraged by the accusation and interjects quickly, “That’s a damned lie!” Black scowls at him, answering, “Prove it to a jury, Stein. Gentlemen, do your duty.”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Two men in business suits accompany Black. They approach Professor Stein and one hands him a lengthy legal document. “Professor, I represent the Nuclear Regulations Council. Until we’ve investigated Doctor Black’s allegations - - we’re forced to enjoin the opening of this plant!” one man explains. “But this is absurd! The man’s a crook!” Stein blurts in shock, adding, “I fired him for stealing equipment - - and now he frames me?” Black sneers at him as he turns to leave. “Life stinks, doesn’t it, Professor?” he asks, barking, “See you in court.” Stein crumples the injunction in his fist, glowering at Black. “I’d sooner see you in Hell!” he yells.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Stein looks around the control room, downcast and dejected. “Damn! I know how the public reacts! If this plant closes for any reason, people will believe it’s due to faulty design!” he worries, “Civic groups will pressure the government to keep the plant closed - - and all my work will have been for…nothing!” He pounds his fist on a control panel in frustration. “By God, no!” he cries angrily. “Injunction or no, I’m placing this plant online tonight,” he vows, “and no one is going to stop me!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Several hours later, rejoining our other cast-member…A telephone rings in the Raymond family kitchen where Ronnie is busy preparing dinner. “There goes the phone! Dad isn’t home yet - - sot it has to be him!” Ronnie thinks, “Just once, I wish he’d be like a normal father. With Mom dead, there’s no one I can…” He picks up the phone. “Hi, Dad!” he answers, “Oh, sure, Dad. Lots of work at the paper…can’t make it home for dinner…Disappointed? No, Dad, I don’t mind…honest…”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shortly after, Ronnie sits alone in the living room eating his dinner and watching the evening news. The broadcast is featuring coverage of the protests at the Hudson Nuclear Power Plant. “…protesters from the Coalition to Resist Atomic Power have marched outside the new plant all week,” the announcer’s voice explains, “Their leader, Edward Earhart, had this to say earlier today…” The screen cuts to an image of the reporter questioning Earhart. “Now is the time for all intelligent people to join in the battle against nuclear proliferation - - right here in America!” Earhart tells the camera, “It’s a cause demanding attention from all serious men and women - - and I’m proud to stand in the vanguard of…” Ronnie snaps his finger and his face lights up with inspiration. “That’s it!” he says with a smile, “I know how I can prove to Doreen I’m not a dumb jock!” He races to the phone and dials her number.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“…you’re joining Eddie Earhart’s group?” Doreen asks moments later, “Ronnie, is that wise?” Ronnie explains, “I just want you to be proud of me, Doreen.” Doreen is a little worried. “Me? What about you?” she asks, “Ronnie, your self-esteem is more important than - - Ronnie?” Clik! The line goes dead in Doreen’s ear. “He hung up!” she exclaims, “But - - he won’t do anything rash! Ronnie’s a smart kid. He’ll be okay - - I hope!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Not long after, on a shadowed street in Manhattan’s Upper West Side… “Hi - - uh, is this the Coalition Headquarters?” Ronnie asks at the doorway of a rundown building. “It sure ain’t the Sanford Arms, kid! Whatsamatter? Ain’t it fancy enough for ya?” asks the man that answered Ronnie’s knock. “No - - I mean, not that! I just expected - - something different,” Ronnie answers. “Don’t we all. My name’s Eddie Earhart, kid - - you might say I’m the Head Honcho.” Earhart puts his arm around Ronnie and invites him inside. “I’m Ronnie Raymond. I…uh…thought, if you want volunteers…” Ronnie offers. Earhart nods, replying, “We always want volunteers, kid. Grab a chair.”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie steps across the room to find a seat. “Eddie, hey - - what’s the idea?” an activist nicknamed Wolf-Man whispers, “We’ve got a big job tonight - - who needs a punk tagging along?” Earhart frowns at him. “You dummy,” he whispers back, “This kid’s got no ties to us, right? He’s new - - which makes him the perfect patsy!” Wolf-Man grins, grasping the scheme. “Smart! That way the cops’ll never connect us to the bombing!” he whispers. “There’s hope for you yet, Wolf-Man!” Earhart answers softly.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">And so, a short time later, a battered gray van thumps its way north on the Henry Hudson Highway - - while, within… “Funny, but you talk different from the way you sounded on TV,” Ronnie notes as he watches Eddie drive. “Politics, kid,” Earhart answers, “You wanna make an impact on the masses, you gotta sound special - - comprende?” Ronnie sighs, “Uh…I guess so.”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Soon, after an hour’s bumping drive into Westchester… “Isn’t this the experimental plant where you were demonstrating this afternoon?” Ronnie asks. “You’re real bright, kid!” Earhart snorts sarcastically, “Only tonight we’re gonna do more than just wave placards!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie looks on with confusion as an activist cuts a hole through the plant’s security fence with bolt cutters. He walks inside nervously behind Earhart. Several activists carry a heavy wooden crate. “Uh, but, listen - - isn’t breaking in like this against the law?” Ronnie asks anxiously. Earhart glares at him, answering, “Yeah. So?”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie stops and points at Earhart. “So? So - - maybe you better tell me what we’re doing here!” Ronnie demands. “Whadya think, kid?” Earhart snarls, “We’re gonna make an example of this joint - - by blowing it sky high!” Ronnie’s eyes get wide in shock. “No! People might be killed! I won’t let you…” Earhart rushes Ronnie. “Kid - - what makes you think you can stop us?” he yells. KRAK! Eddie surprises Ronnie with a left cross into his jaw and Ronnie falls unconscious into the snow!</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Professor Stein has been watching the altercation on the plant’s security monitor. “Hell - - and double Hell!” he thinks as he gets up quickly from the control panel, “With the plant officially shut down, there’re no security guards!” He runs to the hallway leading to the plant entrance. “I’ve been watching the monitors myself, while bringing the atomic pile to full power. And I think I’ve seen quite enough!” he decides.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Earhart leads his henchmen into the plant. Two carry Ronnie’s limp body between them. Professor Stein throws open the hallway door to confront the intruders. “You, there! Release that boy and get out - - before I call the police!” Stein yells. Earhart runs up to the Professor. “You shoulda called the cops first, Pops! Too bad - - for you!” CHUNK! Earhart pounds across Stein’s jaw with a vicious backhand blow! “YUNNGH!” Stein groans, collapsing in an unconscious heap on the floor.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Earhart’s men quickly unload the heavy wooden crate and busy themselves readying and placing dynamite charges. “Leave ‘em together over by the atomic pile!” Earhart orders his men, and they drag Ronnie and the Professor across the floor. “When this gizmo goes off - - there won’t be enough left of both of them to make one man! Let the fuzz figure that one!” Eddie tells his crew. He sets the timing fuse and activates it. “Now come on!” he orders “We’ve got us another date at the Brooks Atomic Plant in Jersey!” Ronnie slowly opens his eyes as the activists make their exit. He sits up, rubbing his jaw. “Uh…my head…where, what…?” he mumbles confusedly as he comes to.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">With a squeal of aging axles, the battered van speeds off, and as it does, it passes another vehicle heading in the opposite direction - - a car driven by Professor Stein’s treacherous former assistant, one Doctor Danton Black:</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Now is a perfect opportunity to sneak a look at Stein’s computer designs,” Black thinks as he stealthily exits his car, “then I can copy his plans to support my claim that - - eh?” He stops abruptly. “A hole in the perimeter fence, a broken doorlock - - both signs that someone has broken in here!” Black thinks, “If one of my enemies has beaten me to Stein’s material - - I may need to resort to violence!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Simultaneously, a dozen steps away…Tik-tik-tik-tik! An ominous sound catches Ronnie’s ear. “Dynamite - - with a timer set to explode!” Ronnie sees with horror. He sprints toward the device. “I can’t leave this old guy lying here!” he panics, looking at Stein, “Gotta grab the bomb before it…”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At another time and in another place, under different circumstances, both Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein would be dead in less than three seconds. Fate, however, has other plans! A few minutes ago, this plant was activated for the first time - - and in a way inexplicable, it now blooms to full fury - - catalyzed by the thundering dynamite detonation! A million ergs of radiation pour through man and boy like sunlight through a pair of windows - - very special radiation, unlike anything previously unleashed by man!</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">And they’re not the only living creatures touched by that nuclear fury - - for, in the corridor beyond, Danton Black is also struck by waves of ravaging radiation - - a tide so powerful, it slams him back into total unconsciousness! And as he sprawls there, flamelets dancing on the smoldering remains of his Yves St. Laurent sports ensemble, his body seems to shimmer momentarily - - before starting to shine with a soft amber glow…</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While, inside the main reactor room, Ronnie Raymond finds himself whirling in a bizarre maelstrom… “I feel - - like I’m melting!” Ronnie groans, “No, not melting - - merging! Like stereo images coming into focus! Atomic rings spin and whirl, drawing the two forms of Ronnie and the Professor closer together in an unbelievable nuclear fusion! “I’m changing - - but I’m still alive! Ronnie cries out.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Suddenly a single being with flaming hair stands where there were once two men! “Yet that isn’t possible! An explosion of that magnitude - - coupled with exposure to such colossal radiation…” Ronnie exclaims. He stops abruptly, thinking quickly, “Huh? Did I say that - - rattle off that scientific jargon? My mind feels like its crawling with information! Things I never knew before - - couldn’t even guess before!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The newly fused being stands in the blinding nuclear light. “Suddenly, I almost seem to know what’s happening inside me!” Ronnie says with amazement, “That wall - - I can look at it, and it’s as though I can ‘read’ its atomic structure - - just by glancing! Yes - - yes, I can!” The being looks around quickly, studying his surroundings in an entirely new way. “I can see how the wall is composed of various molecular combinations!” Ronnie says, “And if I can see that - - I can change it! All I have to do is just touch the atoms of the escaping gas and air - - and I can mend the shattered wall by rearranging the air’s atomic structure - - with all the ease of Aladdin rubbing his Magic Lamp! Fan-taas-tic!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie watches in wonder as nuclear energy flows right out of his fingertip. “Everywhere I look, objects seem so different! It’s like a fog breaking on a sunny day!” Ronnie exclaims, “Before, the world was hazy, indistinct - - but now, I’ve changed somehow, and I can see things more clearly than…” Ronnie stops abruptly as he looks down. “Whoops! Oboy - - talk about seeing things clearly!” he blurts, “Where’s my pants?”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The being flexes his arms and focuses nuclear energy in the palms of his hands. “Must’ve lost them in the explosion! The same explosion which made me something new - - a Nuclear Man!” Ronnie cries out, “Hey! If I can fix walls, I sure should be able to sew up a new pair of jeans! And since I’ve got the powers of some crazy super-hero - - I might as well have the duds to match!” In an instant, the being is clothed in an iconic red and yellow costume. “What is it you call the aftermath of a nuclear explosion?” Ronnie asks. “A firestorm! That’s it!” he decides excitedly, “That’s what I’ll call myself - - Firestorm, the Nuclear Man!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Then, abruptly, the air quivers as though in a heat wave, and the youth called Firestorm feels a splitting sensation, as… “There’s - - there’s someone else inside me - - in my mind!” Ronnie thinks as he senses another person’s presence in his thoughts. “W-Who…?” he asks anxiously. “The name is Stein, Ronald. Martin Stein,” the mental presence answers, “You’re apparently communicating with my subconscious. You might say I’m your other half…” Ronnie gasps. “Then - - that merging I felt after the explosion - - was real?” he asks breathlessly, “I’m you - - and you’re me!” Stein nods, answering, “And it seems we’re both the super-being you named Firestorm! We appear to be victims of an uncanny nuclear fusion!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie thinks for a moment, asking, “But - - if we’re both inside - - then who’s in charge?” Stein explains, “You are, Ronald, because I was unconscious during the accident - - my personality is in a passive mode! Our decisions will have to be made by you alone! I can only advise - - provide information - - and contribute half our strength!” Professor Stein returns their focus to more pressing matters. “Our personas are rejoining, Ronald - - for, if I remember properly, we have a mission to perform.”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie lowers their atomic density and they fly through the plant wall out into the sky. “Eddie Earhart!” Ronnie quickly recalls, “While I was coming around, I heard him mention a Jersey atomic plant! I’ll get him, Professor, but first I wanna test my new powers! Something tells me this is gonna be a gas!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">And, as the Nuclear Man swoops toward distant Manhattan, his atomic structure altered to less than the density of air, he leaves behind Doctor Danton Black - - who continues to glow weirdly - - though now he shifts position, and starts to wake, with a muffled groan.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A moment frozen in time: the wound of memory heals, and Firestorm girds himself for battle renewed - - with a grin!</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Gangway, losers!” Ronnie yells as he blasts into Eddie Earhart’s mischievous thugs, “You bozos have caused enough trouble for one night - - so get ready to pack it in!” Activists are knocked and scattered as Firestorm speeds through them. “Wolf-Man…Stomp ‘im!” Earhart yells. Wolf-Man picks up a 2 x 4 and swings it at Firestorm…but the wooden weapon simply passes right through the Nuclear Man! “Neat trick, huh?” Ronnie asks with a laugh, “Wait’ll you see the rest of my act! Mainly - - this!” SHOOOOM! Ronnie fires a restructuring burst at the floor underneath the miscreants, instantly opening a large hole and the stunned activists plunge! “Hey! Where’s the floor?” one yells. “Somebody throw me a rope!” another cries out. “Whoa, Momma!” a third chimes in shock.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Professor Stein detects a danger, warning quickly, “Ronald, to your rear.” One of Eddie’s thugs approaches with his gun drawn! “I saw him, Professor - - almost like I have eyes in the back of my head!” Ronnie says, whirling around to face the gunman. “Let’s see you duck a bullet, Buster!” the thug snarls as he aims his revolver, “Fancy suit or not, you’re a dead - - cucumber?” The thug stares blankly at the cucumber he now holds, placed there by a restructuring burst Firestorm aimed at the gun. “Chew on that, Micro-Mind!” Ronnie calls out to him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Reeeee-Reeeee! A swarm of police cars approaches rapidly. “Sirens! We must’ve set off the alarms - - now the fuzz are almost here!” worries Earhart, “Everything’s gone wrong! I wanted to make a splash, be important - - but I blew it, just like I always blow everything! Damn! My whole crummy life has been a bust! Flunkin’ college, losing all my jobs - - well, not this time!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Earhart makes a dive toward the dynamite charges, leaping right past Firestorm. “This time, if I’m going down - - I won’t go alone!” Earhart vows as he lights the fuse. “Earhart, are you nuts?” Ronnie yells in horror, “You’re setting off the dynamite!” Ronnie turns and sprints towards the explosives. “I have to move - - try something far-out - - and if it doesn’t work - - we’re all gonna end up part of the woodwork!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">KA-BLAMMMA! An instant of thunder, a second of flame, and then, incredibly, survival! Earhart looks around incredulously. “Wh-What’d you do? Wh-Why aren’t we dead?” he stammers confusedly at Firestorm. “We didn’t die because I absorbed the blast into my own bod,” Ronnie explains, “And brother, do I need an Alka-Seltzer! But first…” He slowly walks closer to Earhart, clenching both fists. “Why’re you lookin’ at me that way? The cops are here now - - you wouldn’t…” POWW! Ronnie smashes his fist mightily into Earhart! “Oh, wouldn’t I?” Ronnie asks as Earhart tumbles away like a dry leaf in a windstorm.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moments later, a fiery figure arrows up from the Brooks Nuclear Power Plant, soaring eastward across the muddy Hudson River…Eastward, to the isle of Manhattan - - and the street that Ronnie Raymond is beginning to call… “Home! Wait’ll Dad gets a load of me in this - - huh?” Ronnie stops abruptly as he sees his reflection in a large window. The face of the flame-haired Nuclear Man looks back at him. “A reflection in that shop window! Who the heck is - - me?” Ronnie cries out in shock. “But it isn’t me! What’s happened to Ronnie Raymond?” he yells, “I don’t want to be Firestorm forever! I want to be me! Me! MEEEEEEEEEE!”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">And, as suddenly as that (and as inexplicably as it began) - - the freakish fusion ends:</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">“Uhhhh!” Ronnie groans, “Seeing myself in that makeshift mirror must have been a trigger! Me and the Professor are splitting up…But for good…or only for a little while? Funny. Never thought I’d believe it, but maybe I’ll be glad if we never join again…yeah…maybe…”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ronnie bends down to help Professor Stein, who looks a little wobbly and disoriented as he tries to get up. “W-Where am I…?” Stein mumbles, “Last thing…I remember…an explosion!” Ronnie reaches an arm under Stein’s shoulder to steady him and help him walk. “Here, Professor. Lean on me,” Ronnie suggests. Stein looks at him with wide-eyed confusion. “Wh-Who are you?” Stein asks in bewilderment. “A friend, Professor,” Ronnie answers reassuringly, “Yeah…Can you believe it? A friend.”</p>",

Former policeman Travis Clevenger — aka Bloodhound — is in the third year of a 20-year prison sentence for brutally killing his partner. But his gift for profiling super-criminals leads the F.B.I. to offer him a chance at freedom if he'll help them track down a super-powered serial killer. All that stands in their way is a prison riot aimed at keeping him from leaving prison alive!</span><br /></div>",

    "description": "<p><i>Liz has been acting snarkier than usual, and Mary Jane is determined to get some answers--even if it costs her their friendship! At the same time, Flash and Harry make an awkward attempt at revisiting a time when they were the best of friends.</i></p><p>Mary Jane is trying on her Homecoming dress in the mall as a flaming pumpkin head shoots toward her. The projectile is stopped inches in front of her face by Spider-Man, who is fighting the Green Goblin in that very clothing store. Spidey stops the Green Goblin and tells MJ that he changed his mind about going to Homecoming with her, but instead of being thrilled, MJ tells him that she's going with her dream guy - Harry Osborn.</p><p>In a flash, Harry appears in a field of flowers, wearing a snappy suit. MJ steps into his embrace, and the two are about to kiss when Mary Jane's daydream is interrupted by her teacher. MJ and Harry, who was also sleeping, are told off for not paying attention.</p><p>Later, at the Coffee Bean, Harry and MJ discuss school. Harry reveals that his dad forbade him from going to Homecoming until he gets his act together and gets better grades. MJ is concerned, and tells Harry that they'll have to make sure he aces the next Physics test so that they can go.</p><p>Later, at home, MJ tries to call Liz. Liz has been avoiding her and not taking her calls, and MJ is worried about her friend.</p><p>At the library, Peter Parker tries to tutor Harry in physics. Harry just can't understand, and gets extremely frustrated. Harry offers Peter $100 to help him cheat on the test and Peter is so shocked that he leaves. He runs into MJ on the way out, and she consoles him, telling him that he can't expect to help everyone with everything.</p><p>MJ decides to tutor Harry, and tells him that she'll quiz him and give him a kiss for every answer he gets right. However, they both end up making out in the stacks and not studying at all, and decide that it isn't going to work out.</p><p>In class the next day, the two get caught passing notes and get detention. Harry reveals that he's happy about detention because the teacher keeps the Physics test on her desk. He asks MJ to help him cheat and get a glimpse of the test, but MJ has doubts.</p><p>Flash finds MJ at her locker, and he complains about Liz. Liz has been treating Flash even worse lately, and Flash is confused as to what has set the girl off. MJ decides to confront Liz, and finds her in a lecture hall. Liz tries to avoid MJ, but the two start talking. MJ tells Liz how Harry wants her to cheat, and Liz gets extremely angry, saying that she hates cheaters and that \"cheaters are the scum of the Earth. They're selfish jerks who take great pleasure in hurting their friends' feelings\" and stomps off. Although MJ doesn't know it, Liz is referring to the time she caught Mary Jane and Flash hugging after the football game.</p><p>At detention, Harry tries everything to get the teacher out of the room so he can see the test. Finally the teacher is called into the office to get some roses from her husband, but MJ intervenes at the last minute and says that she'll go get it. After detention, Harry is extremely angry that she ruined his chances and breaks up with her.</p>",

Get ready for the ride of your life! A perfect starting point for any new reader!</em></p><p><u>Flashback:</u></p><p>Professor X has been trying to contact the Shi'ar, to warn them that the vengeance-crazed Vulcan is on his way, but the Shi'ar refuse to respond, shunning Professor X ever since his marriage to Lilandra was annulled. With things still tense between himself and Cyclops, Xavier asks Nightcrawler for his help in cleaning up his past mistakes. He then enlists Warpath, anxious to leave the \"reservation\" that the Institute has become, and Marvel Girl, who yearns to return to Shi'ar space.</p><p><u>Synopsis:</u></p><p>In Egypt, Polaris is being hunted by members of an anti-Apocalypse cult, and fights back with her new tech-based magnetic powers. When Professor X's new splinter team suddenly arrives to aid her, Polaris is glad to see that Havok is a member, and surprised to see that Charles is walking again. He explains that the team plans to follow Vulcan into Shi'ar space and try to rein him in before any more lives are lost. Meanwhile, Vulcan enters Shi'ar space, and destroys the first Shiar ship he sees.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> <u><i>Overview:<br /><br /></i></u></em>A brand new era for the Uncanny X-Men begins here! Fresh off X-MEN: DEADLY GENESIS, Ed Brubaker takes the helm of Marvel’s mighty mutants. Billy Tan joins Ed for a story that won’t just affect earth, but will rock the foundations of the entire galaxy! Vulcan is out for revenge and has his sites set on the Shi’Ar Empire! Get ready for the ride of your life! A perfect starting point for any new reader!<br /><br /></p><h3> <u><b>Issue Summary:</b></u></h3><br /><br />(present) <br />The doors of a darkened room begin to creak open, before being shattered by the magnetic power of Polaris. She apologizes to Warpath and Havok. It’s a little more power than she intended to use. Havok asks her not to worry about it. It got the job done.  <p>Warpath looks inside and sees that it isn’t quite done yet. Two humanoid robots with caterpillar tracks sense their arrival and head their way. Havok readies himself, but Warpath is eager for action. He steams in, using his vibranium knives and super strength to rip apart the first security robot. Havok tells him he’s in his way, but James asks if he can’t aim. Havok replies, “Fine, have it your way,” before turning the robots into slag, missing James by the narrowest of margins. Nightcrawler appears above them, and tells them that this isn’t the time for games. Warpath contacts the Professor via a wrist communicator and informs him that they’re in.  </p><p>Above a mountainous forest, the blackbird is circling. Professor Xavier is at the helm, with Rachel standing behind him; her hands places on either side of his head. She feels she should be down there with the others, but Charles assures her that they are more than capable of clearing the access tunnels. What they’re doing is equally important. Once she absorbs the flight training from his memory, she’ll be able to teach the whole team while they sleep.  </p><p>Rachel folds her arms, responding with a hint of sarcasm that she loves how it’s okay to walk in their dreams, now that Charles needs her to be his telepathic hands. Darwin asks Charles if they’re staying out of the fray because of him. Charles assures him that they’re not - not entirely at least.  </p><p>(earlier that morning at the Xavier Institute) <br />Charles informs Cyclops that Darwin will be joining his team, but Scott refuses, stating that Darwin is not ready for fieldwork. Charles replies that he’s more than ready. He doesn’t plan on letting him out of his sight and, beyond that, he actually wants to go. Scott reminds Charles that Bobby always wanted to go, too, but that didn’t stop him from benching him until he was ready. Charles thinks that this is different. Darwin and Gabriel were friends. He may be the best chance they have to really reach his brother.  </p><p>Scott doesn’t care about that and, to be blunt, Vulcan is not the brother he is worried about. Charles says that he should be. And, he adds, Scott should also be worrying about his father, Corsair. He’s out there in the path of Vulcan’s fury as well. Scott doesn’t trust Charles to protect his family, including Rachel, out in space, but Charles says that he’s trying to prevent a tragedy, not <em>cause</em> one. Scott looks away, saying that the line has a tendency to blur, doesn’t it? Charles asks if he should just do nothing. Would that satisfy him? He’s trying to make up for what he’s done wrong. All Scott sees is him taking people he cares about into harm’s way. Havok appears and asks Scott to give Charles a break. He wouldn’t have let him go without him. As twisted as he is, Vulcan is a Summers and they take care of their own… remember?  </p><p>Alex places a hand on his brother’s shoulder, and says that he knows how mad he is at the Professor, but this is bigger than all of them. There’s more at risk. And, he adds, he’s an X-Man. He’s not just going to sit on his hands waiting for the sky to fall. Scott throws his arm around Alex’s shoulder and lightens up. He guesses his stubborn brother isn’t about to do that. Charles tells Alex and Darwin that they need to move. The stealth jet is hidden beyond the tunnels they’re in, but the Sentinels could find it. The others are waiting. Scott asks them just to come home safely… all of them.  </p><p>(present) <br />Charles and his team are standing in a verdant area with very futuristic-looking buildings in the near distance. Warpath is surprised that there is a hidden Shi’ar base inside a lifeless volcano in upstate New York. He asks again why it is that they didn’t just fly in through the top. Charles replies hat it’s because the opening would be nearly impossible to find, for one. Shi’ar holographic projection is hundreds of years beyond that they know. James asks what the other reason is. Charles informs him that their security would have disintegrated them, and Reed Richards would have been very unhappy with him. Experimental stealth jets don’t come cheaply.  </p><p>Rachel asks the Professor how long he’s known about the base’s existence. Charles replies that he knew that Davan Shakari, the emperor’s main man, once had a base in the States, but Lilandra never let him know where it was. She promised it had been abandoned. Until recently, that was good enough for him. He only found it by breaking a promise of his own. He allowed Reed Richards and Tony Stark to examine the Shi’ar technology he had. With what they learned, the helped him to find this place.  </p><p>Darwin asks if this is where Vulcan grew up. Charles replies that it was. He was part of a contingent of slaves who worked in the manor house. Darwin states that he never talked about his life before Moira found him. Charles admits that Davan Shakari was a spy, and this base was where visiting dignitaries came to meet with him, to decide if their planet was worth <em>absorbing</em> into the Shi’ar Empire. It’s no wonder that he kept his past to himself. Gabriel’s days here must have been a <em>nightmare</em>.  </p><p>As the team slowly make their way down into the base of the volcano, three Imperial Shockers are awakened form their slumber. A computer gives them their objective: find intruders and destroy. “Objective understood,” replies one of the Shockers.  </p><p>Back in the volcanic forest, Darwin still doesn’t fully understand. Why would the Shi’ar, if they are this advanced race, leave all this here for anyone to find? “Because they’re arrogant,” replies Rachel. Charles says he’s afraid there’s some truth in what Rachel pointed out, but it also has to do with their politics. When Davan Shakari was here, D’Ken was emperor. But, D’Ken was rendered catatonic, and Lilandra became empress, thanks in part to the X-Men. Lilandra evacuated her people from Earth out of respect for that… and out of love for him - love which has apparently diminished, on her end at least.  </p><p>As they walk, the Imperial Shockers monitor them. They deduce that Havok and Polaris are the most dangerous, with Rachel the next in line. They figure the rest will fall quickly after them. One fires a burst of energy from its palm. Warpath senses it, but is too late to save Lorna from being hit in the chest. She screams, as Warpath and Nightcrawler spot their assailants. Kurt teleports towards them and Rachel joins them on the offensive as Alex looks after Lorna.  </p><p>Charles asks Darwin to stay by him. Whatever it was that hit Lorna, Alex feels that it’s killing her. Charles points out that it’s a collapsing energy field. If he touches her he can probably absorb most of it, but it’s not solar. He won’t be able to control it, so it’ll hurt a lot. Alex doesn’t need asking twice, and he makes contact, screaming himself as the energy is transferred into his body and out of Lorna’s.  </p><p>Meanwhile, one of the Shockers grabs Warpath and bundles him hard against a wall. James realizes that the thing is faster than him, but that’s not such a big deal. He likes a challenge. He leaps at the Shocker, knife at the ready, whilst Nightcrawler teleports in and kicks another from behind. Rachel says that she had him, but as Kurt smashes its face into the ground, he informs her that these aren’t like the Shi’ar Death Commandos. They seem to feel no pain. He needs her to get in his head and find out how best to stop them.  </p><p>(The Imperial Shocker’s memory) <br />The phoenix symbol appears over Rachel’s left eye as she works her way into the creature’s mind. What she sees is horrific. He is a slave, being dragged by a chain wrapped around his neck. He is laid down on some kind of table where a small circular saw goes to work on his body. He is left a mindless cyborg slave.  </p><p>(present) <br />Rachel informs Kurt that they <em>want</em> to die. They were prisoners whom the Shi’ar experimented on, turning them into what they see there. There are devices in their brains, keeping them alive, but in the part of them that is still free, buried deep inside, they want to die. That’s all James needs to hear, and he snaps the neck of his opponent. Darwin wishes to help, but Charles tells him his adaptive power is more a defensive skill. Alex begins to recover, just as one of the Shockers appears behind Charles. Darwin growls and grabs the Shocker by the shoulders, pushing him backwards through a window and into a deep shaft. They both fall to the bottom, and as the Shocker splats, Darwin rolls with a certain degree of finesse, righting himself.  </p><p>The last remaining Shocker fights Rachel’s telekinetic hold on him, but James asks her not to worry. Plunging a knife through his face, he says the fight is over. Nightcrawler teleports after Darwin to ensure he’s okay, and finds him standing there, unharmed. Darwin explains that of course he’s unharmed. He adapts, remember? “Oh,” he adds, “I found the spaceship, too.”  </p><p>Beside them is a Shi’ar star cruiser; a small spaceship which has a tail end resembling a scorpion’s. It has a multi-faceted green window at the front and two arms at either side. The X-Men board the craft, and Charles tells Warpath that they will discuss his actions later. They may have been mostly machine, but the X-Men <em>do not</em> kill. James replies that he might agree with him, but the way he sees it, he was just freeing a slave from its torment.  </p><p>Everyone takes their positions, with Charles at the flight controls. The fuel is good and the power is fully charged. He asks everyone to strap themselves in. As he recalls, these ships are a bit rough on takeoff. The ship exits the building and out of the volcano, heading into space. “Oh man, this is so cool,” beams Darwin.  </p><p>Before long, the ship is a long way from Earth and, according to the charts, the first stargate is beyond the moon. After that there are four more jumps to Shi’ar space. Alex asks how long it will take them to get there, and Charles figures it’ll be about a day’s travel between stargates. Their ship can access them without any hacking because it’s from their own fleet. They should pass unnoticed until they can get a message out to Alex’s father. They spot the first stargate ahead of them. Charles informs them that it’ll take them out to the next point on the Shi’ar charts, far outside their own galaxy. Auto-Pilot should track to the next jumpgate, but he asks Alex to check the charts to make sure.  </p><p>Rachel wishes to speak about what she saw in the mind of the Shocker. She thinks the Shi’ar are monsters. Before they can continue their discussion, Alex informs the Professor that they have a problem. He’s not getting a reading for the next stargate, or any of the other ones in this sector. “According to the computer, the jumpgates have been <em>destroyed</em>. Charles looks out the window into the far reaches of space. “My god… it’s Vulcan. It has to be. He’s <em>stranded</em> us.” </p> <p><br /> </p>",

    "description": "<p><u>Overview:</u></p><p>Vulcan is mad. So mad he’s planning on destroying an entire intergalactic empire. The third Summers brother has set his sites on the Shi’Ar Empire, and when he’s finished with them, nothing will ever be the same!</p><h3><u><b>Issue Summary:</b></u></h3><p>(present)</p><p>Gabriel Summers, now known as Vulcan, is a powerful mutant out on a mission of vengeance for things that were done long before he was Vulcan. He recently learned of his true origin and, although the memories are too hard to bear, he cannot stop thinking about it.</p><p>(flashback to Gabriel’s birth)</p><p>Christopher and Katherine Summers were kidnapped from Earth by the Shi’ar Advance Scouts, while his mother was pregnant with Gabriel. Christopher tried valiantly to protect them from the evil emperor D’Ken, but his efforts were in vain, and he was forced to watch D’Ken ripping Gabriel from his dying mother’s womb. Gabriel almost died but he was placed inside an incubation-accelerator where he grew up to suitable slave age in only months.</p><p>(present)</p><p>Knowing these things would be bad enough for Vulcan, but having actually seen the images in his own memory and seeing the madman laughing over his mother’s corpse is enough to drive him across the great blackness of space. He wishes to find this Emperor D’Ken and make him pay. With each passing day, he wishes he hadn’t made Marvel Girl and Charles Xavier show him how he came to be, because he cannot wash these images away. So, he will have to burn them out instead.</p><p>He has lost track of the days since he left Earth but it’s been at least a week. He approaches a Shi’ar star cruiser at high speed. They are unprepared for him, and that’s something he’s been counting on. He ploughs straight through the ship, destroying it. Its crew float into space, helpless against their attacker.</p><p>(present)</p><p>The remains of the ship drift into the emptiness of space along with the crew. It’s almost too easy, thinks Vulcan. There must be more to the Shi’ar than this! He grabs a hold of one crewmember wearing a space suit, which allows him to survive the cold, oxygen-free environment of the vacuum. He asks the man if he understands him, to which he replies that he does. Shi’ar galaxians learn nearly every spoken language. He asks, though, how Vulcan manages to speak in the emptiness. Vulcan replies that his voice is pure energy, transmitting to his communicator.</p><p>The man asks why he has attacked them. They aren’t a warship. Vulcan tells him that they are Shi’ar - isn’t that enough? The man assures him that the Shi’ar are no longer a threat to Earth, but Vulcan asks rhetorically if that is supposed to erase the things they have done. He doesn’t think so. He asks how far away the Shi’ar homeworld is. The man replies that he will never make it to Chandilar alive. Throneworld’s defenses could hold back Galactus himself for days. Vulcan clenches his fist and asks if he’d rather die for his corrupt empire. The man quickly agrees to tell him what he needs to know.</p><p>He informs Vulcan that even at his speed, it would take several years to reach Chandilar. The Stargates are the only way to arrive more swiftly. However, only Shi’ar vessels may activate the gates. A man flying alone under his own power through the heavenly terrain, as wondrous as Vulcan may be, will not be able to activate them.</p><p>Vulcan figures he’ll have to find another ship, because he has business with his emperor, D’Ken, and he doesn’t intend to wait years to settle it. “D’Ken?” replies the man, surprised. He informs Vulcan that he’s waited too long. D’Ken has lain in the sleep of the near-dead for many cycles. Lilandra is empress of the Shi’ar. “What!” barks Vulcan. The man adds that he seeks vengeance on a ghost. He rages at history. Vulcan, having let the man go, flies towards him and replies, “No… I rage at you.” He unleashes a burst of energy from his hand that rips right through his unfortunate victim leaving him a smoldering carcass as he floats away.</p><p>Vulcan realizes that the man is right. He needs a ship in order to travel more quickly. He extends his arms outwards. Through his exposure to a massive amount of mutant energy, Vulcan was not only awakened from his own near-death state, but his abilities were elevated to omega-level. He now remembers his training and the words of Professor Xavier, and his senses reach out into the blackness around him, searching until he feels the power cells of three Shi’ar ships pulsing in the distance. Following their trail is straight-forward after that.</p><p>As he approaches the Shi’ar warships, they don’t hesitate to attack. They fire rockets at Vulcan but he explodes them before they reach. He is knocked backwards by the shock wave, but turns to fight. He only needs one of the ships intact, but he would like the ship’s crew to serve him of their own will. His brief memories of his father’s time with the Shi’ar show the Shi’ar to respect that which can defeat them. They respect what they fear. He knows that it will take most of his energy to destroy two of the ships, and he’s not even certain that it can be done.</p><p>Vulcan flies around the ships, causing their seeker missiles to follow him back towards them. Two of the ships are damaged; their power sources exploding when the missiles hit home. Their weapons, life support and artificial gravity shut down, and the two warships drift towards each other swiftly, until colliding, destroying both.</p><p>With the little energy he has left, Vulcan communicates with the remaining warship. He gives them a choice: either join their companions in death or surrender their vessel to his command. He gives the captain one minute to decide. The captain doesn’t know how weak Vulcan is now, but he does figure that he cannot stand against such a powerful figure. He clenches his fist. “We are defeated!”</p><p>Vulcan boards his ship and is hailed by the captain who offers him a sword. Vulcan tells him to keep it. He doesn’t need one, and the captain might want to fall on it at some point in the near future.</p><p>(later)</p><p>Vulcan is resting in his chambers when the captain arrives. Vulcan asks if his orders are understood. The captain replies that they will be followed, but he doesn’t understand why the stargates must be destroyed as they pass through them. It will cripple interstellar travel for the empire. Vulcan is sure it will, but he’s not that concerned about the Shi’ar. He’s thinking of the Earthmen who will follow him. The captain informs him that Earthers cannot access the gates, but Vulcan warns him not to underestimate them.</p><p>He then asks about Lilandra. The captain explains that Lilandra inherited the throne when great Emperor D’Ken was taken by illness. She is the youngest sister of the Neremani line. Her older sister is in exile, and her name is Deathbird. No one has heard of her for a while, but it is believed she still lives. Vulcan finds this information interesting. He suggests the captain take a seat, and then asks for a crash course on Shi’ar history. He needs to know what he is up against.</p><p>Days pass, and Vulcan’s knowledge of the Shi’ar grows with each of them. His newly acquired ship passes through the outer territories of Shi’ar space, spreading destruction in its wake. Vulcan watches from his seat on the command deck, knowing that his legend is growing with each attack. He also knows that rumor and fear of his arrival has by now reached the Throneworld. It’s a perfect plan, like that of his hero, Julius Caesar.</p><p>The Warbird exits another stargate, taking it into the inner realms of the Shi’ar Empire. Vulcan orders them to blow the gate, and the stargate explodes behind them. He orders his crew to prepare to repel the borders, but a crewmember informs him that there are no ships within scanning range. Then, another crewman informs Vulcan that they are being hailed from space. Vulcan thought as much. He orders them to put them on the comm.</p><p>Outside the ship, Gladiator and three members of the Imperial Guard are in the ship’s path, leaving their own ship behind. Gladiator informs the captain of the M’Kaedo that he is guilty of treason against the imperium. He is ordered to surrender his vessel and turn himself in for summary judgment, or face the wrath of the Imperial Guard!</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Prof. X and his new team find themselves between a hunk of space junk and a hard-place, as they search the wreckage of Vulcan’s path of destruction for the secret that will help them get to the Shi’Ar throneworld in time. But Marvel Girl’s presence on the outskirts of Shi’Ar controlled space has not gone unnoticed, and a new enemy with deep ties to her is unleashed!     <br /></i></p>(Chandilar) <br />The Shi’ar homeworld is bustling with life. From high in his tower, vice-chancellor K’Tor welcomes a visitor in the form of Commander N’Ruto. The commander informs him that the Imperial Guard has been dispatched to confront the rogue warship. With luck, they’ll make contact in the next day. K’Tor enquires about their stargates. The commander replies that fifty-five have been completely destroyed, along with the support ships and the crews that maintain them. The vice-chancellor is angry. They’ve only just finished rebuilding after the Earther’s treachery.  <p>N’Ruto reminds him that the empress proclaimed Xavier innocent in that matter, but K’Tor insists she was <em>ashamed</em>. He was her consort and he used his mind control to manipulate her into nearly destroying the realm. It was only through the ministry’s pressure that she dissolved their union and they were able to have Xavier banished. The commander asks if the empress knows of the attacks on the stargates. He is told that she knows only what the vice-chancellor’s superior decides she <em>needs</em> to know. At present her condition is fragile. She is being tended to. N’Ruto then announces that there is another matter he has just received word of… about the line of the Phoenix! This grabs the vice-chancellor’s full attention. </p><p>(the outer rim of the Shi’ar Empire) <br />Professor Xavier and his team of X-Men have come across a space station, and Marvel Girl uses her telepathy to determine whether the occupants are friendly or not. She senses only a skeleton crew, and their thoughts are tame. They should be able to ‘Jedi’ the crew into helping them. Charles gives the order to proceed, and dons a spacesuit to conceal his identity.  </p><p>Once on the station, they find just two men working there, and they welcome the team aboard. Charles feels that whatever facilities they have will be of great use as their own ship is nearly out of fuel. One of them looks out of the window and comments that it’s been too long since he saw such a model of starcraft. He enquires as to where they acquired such a vessel. Charles says Rachel’s name in a questioning manner, and she ‘Jedi’s’ the workman, informing him telepathically that he doesn’t need to know about the ship, and that he just needs to refuel it. The workman returns to his computer and forgets he asked the question, adding that their ship is unmanned so it might take some time. Charles wonders if his crew could gather supplies while they wait. The workman pauses a moment, before offering the run of the station to them. </p><p>Havok and Polaris take one route through the ship whilst Darwin and Nightcrawler choose another. Lorna mentions to Alex that she’s just noticing now, because he uses Rachel to do it, but asks whether the professor has <em>always</em> just pushed his will onto people like that? Alex reckons that he has, when the need arose. He asks if she remembers when Jean became the Phoenix. Charles made an airport full of people forget they’d seen any of them.  </p><p>Lorna says she misses Jean. And, she liked Scott better when she was around… a lot better. Alex agrees, but asks her not to forget that the Shi’ar are the people who killed Jean the first time around, and they’d do the same to the professor given half the chance. He doesn’t mind him pushing a few minds to get them on their way. Is that <em>bad</em> in the grand scheme of things? Lorna guesses not. </p><p>Elsewhere, Nightcrawler and Darwin have taken another route, and Kurt senses that something is troubling Darwin. The newcomer explains that he doesn’t like how the professor’s treating him. They’ve been in space almost a week, and he’s hardly let him out of his sight. Kurt agrees that he’s being overprotective, but Darwin is still new to the team. He guesses Kurt is right, and then asks why Charles is wearing a space suit. Kurt explains that he’s a wanted man in Shi’ar space. It’s a long story involving an evil twin, and Kurt would rather not go into it. </p><p>Meanwhile, Alex and Lorna arrive at a large door with a sword &amp; sickle carved into the doorway. They don’t know what it means, but Alex guesses this is where the security gear was stored when they <em>had</em> a security detail… before this place because the ghost station at the edge of the universe. He places his hand on a glowing white screen and the large door slowly opens. Inside, they discover the dead bodies of several crewmembers who appear to have been killed. Alex gasps. </p><p>Darwin and Kurt are looking for food, and Kurt thinks they’re heading in the wrong direction. Darwin notices a small sign written in Shi’ar, and explains that it means Food Storage. “You can read Shi’ar?” asks Kurt, surprised. Darwin replies that he looked through a few of the ship’s logs until it made sense. Now, through listening to the workmen speaking with the professor he can speak it pretty well, too. He utters something in Shi’ar. </p><p>Amazed, replies Kurt, before asking what it means. Darwin’s smiling face suddenly changes into a frown and he replies, “<em>Look out</em>!” Kurt turns just in time to see an assailant emerge from the shadows and shoot at him. He teleports instantly, but the blast shatters the window behind him and Darwin is sucked out of the station and into the unforgiving coldness of space. Kurt is unable to grab him as he hangs on to a ladder. </p><p>The alarm sounds and the blast doors are activated. Outside the station, Darwin quickly begins to adapt to his new environment. He discovers that he has no need to breathe, and both his skin and internal structure increase in density. He realizes that he must warn the professor that this place isn’t what it seems. Whatever that thing was, it <em>wasn’t</em> Shi’ar, and he’s guessing that neither are the men he’s dealing with. </p><p>Inside the station, Rachel suddenly takes a turn for the worse. She holds her forehead and complains of a sudden nauseating headache. She was trying to mind-probe the lead worker because of the way he kept looking at their ship, and then her headache came on strong. She feels that something’s wrong. She looks up to see Darwin approaching the station. He lands on the outside of the glass, held there by suckers that have formed on his fingers. He looks like he’s trying to tell them something. “What the hell?” exclaims Warpath. </p><p>From Warpath’s blind spot, a Warskrull appears having shape shifted from his previous form of a workman. He is holding a double-edged blade. “Die, Earthmen,” he says, grinning nefariously from ear to ear. He lashes out at James, but he ducks and grabs Rachel, calling out to the professor that this is a <em>trap</em>. Another Warskrull carrying the weapon fired at Nightcrawler sees Kurt teleport above him and he asks what he <em>is</em>. He likes to know what he’s killing. </p><p>Kurt warns him that he’ll be killing no one else today if he has anything to do with it. He teleports them both outside the station and leaves the Warskrull there before returning to the station. He notices that the Warskrull’s armor has formed a protective sheath over his head, and he hopes his friend can also survive out there. </p><p>Rachel is having difficulty moving, and it’s up to Warpath to take on three Warskrulls, all of whom are superior in size. He figures one of them must have an implant that is giving out some kind of feedback to Rachel. He reminds her that she’s not <em>just</em> a telepath. Another Warskrull grabs Charles by his helmet but, before he can do any damage, Havok arrives with Polaris and he blasts the alien. With his back smoldering, the Warskrull turns to his assailant and says he was hoping for a fight. Havok brings it on, pummeling him with his plasma blasts, but the Warskrull simply grins at him and thanks Alex for charging up his forcefield. </p><p>Warpath is being overawed by sheer numbers, despite his prodigious strength. Charles informs Lorna that one of the Skrulls must have an implant, which hurts Rachel, so she uses her powers to reach out and destroy whatever it is. The Warskrulls fall away from James in agony, and Lorna points to one that is still conscious. James gladly delivers a kick to finish him off. There is just one Warskrull remaining, and Alex is keeping him at bay. Charles helps Rachel up, and she isn’t happy about having her head messed with. She assaults the Warskrull, using her telekinesis on a molecular level to take him out. She leaves him alive, despite the fact that he wouldn’t have spared any of them. </p><p>Elsewhere, Darwin appears to have somehow found a way back inside the station. He descends a ladder that leads from what appears to be an access point. Kurt thinks he truly is a wonder. He himself survived a few seconds out there, but Darwin managed to adapt to his environment. He nonchalantly tells Kurt that it’s no big deal. He asks if Kurt can teleport through the door next to them, pointing out that, while he was outside, he was a few Shi’ar locked inside. Maybe they know what’s going on? Kurt asks if the space beyond the door is clear. It is, so he teleports inside.  </p><p>Soon, the X-Men are getting the full story from two surviving Shi’ar crewmen. They inform the professor about Vulcan’s destruction of their ship. They managed to escape in a shuttle, and they found the Warskrulls floating in space in the guise of their own people. They rescued them, and then it was too late. They told of being refugees from their system, having to evacuate due to a force moving through space, destroying all. They wanted a real ship, so they killed the workers at the station and took their places to lay an ambush. </p><p>Rachel asks why <em>they</em> were spared. He replies that the Warskrulls said their code wouldn’t allow them to kill any who saved them. It’s the first he’s heard of Skrulls having any <em>code</em>. Charles feels that the Skrulls aren’t without honor, however twisted it may be. He allows the Shi’ar to travel with them until they reach the nearest hub. Kurt doesn’t think that this is a good idea, but Charles is concerned that the Skrulls might break free before their signal reaches the authorities.  </p><p>Once inside their holding cell, the two Shi’ar chat about Charles who they recognize as being Lilandra’s former consort. For now they can do nothing, but when the time comes, they will deliver him to the vice-chancellor’s justice. </p><p>(the third moon of Phygim - high security prison) <br />The vice-chancellor visits a prisoner who is being held in powerful shackles. He asks the man if he knows who he is. He replies that he’s the man who put him there. The vice-chancellor says that he’s much more than that. He’s also the man who had his brothers killed and his mother sterilized; just as his predecessors have done with the descendents of Rook’shir for five hundred years, wherever they can find them. He looks at Korvus and says he is the last. </p><p>He asks if he knows why he is allowed to live. Korvus has no idea. The vice-chancellor replies that he knew there would be a day when he would need his services. He asks Korvus if he would like his sentence commuted; to roam freely among the stars. Korvus asks what he has to do. “What do you think?” replies the vice-chancellor, “Something that only the <em>Blade of the Phoenix</em> can do…”  </p>",

    "description": "<p><i>The X-Men find themselves deep within Shi’Ar space and even deeper trouble. The Shi’Ar have sent their secret weapon after an unaware Marvel Girl. Meanwhile, Professor X has his hands full with a band of rogue soldiers that have their sights on him. And they are out for blood!</i> <u><b> <br /><br /></b></u>Korvus has been freed by Chancellor K’Tor in order to do his bidding. Korvus looks at the Blade of the Phoenix, which hangs on a wall, and he can’t believe that it is real. It’s the sword of his ancestor, killed 400 cycles past. As he takes it in his fist, he thinks that this day should never have come to pass - Rook’shir’s own blade in his hands. </p> <p>(flashback) <br />Rook’shir flies away from a scene of utter devastation holding the Blade of the Phoenix. Rook’shir is the Shi’ar’s dirty little secret; the Shi’ar who became the <i>Phoenix</i>. He is an intergalactic outlaw with the power of the universe in his grasp. The Shi’ar form the first Imperial Guard in order to stop him from destroying the empire. They catch up with him, and Gladiator delivers the killing blow. However, an infinitesimal piece of the Phoenix force somehow remains inside the sword; a sword only able to be carried by his blood heirs. Korvus is the last of those. </p> <p>(present) <br />Korvus wields the blade, which crackles with energy. He is now the only one able to hold it, and he doesn’t feel that he deserves this honor. But, what choice does he have? Chancellor K’Tor reminds him that his task will buy him his freedom after all these cycles. Korvus grimaces, and replies that the deal has been struck. There’s no need to remind him of it. </p> <p>(weeks later) <br />The X-Men are still traveling through space and Warpath is becoming a little fed up, finding space travel boring. Nightcrawler, piloting the ship, hopes that he’s joking, but James means it. It’s been weeks since they’ve seen anything but asteroid belts and supernovas. If he wasn’t helping train ‘the new kid,’ he’d have thrown himself out of an airlock by now. Nightcrawler motions to the window and asks if he cannot see the <i>majesty</i> of what is around them. Even the black is deeper out there. Kurt could watch the stars pass them by for months without losing interest. James thinks he might get that chance. </p> <p>James explains that the outer stargates which their resident Shi’ar steered them to have helped their progress, but they’re a long way from the heart of Shi’ar space. Meanwhile, he’s going stir crazy and his senses are all over the place. He can’t even remember what grass smells like. Kurt agrees with that sentiment, adding that there are parts of who they are that they only notice when things are different. James says he needs to put his feet on some dirt and feel the wind. Kurt wonders if Rachel could create something telepathically, but James reckons that it may work for Scott and Emma, but it’s not the same for him. Anyway, he adds, Ray’s been so busy with the Professor, he doubts she’d have the time. </p> <p>Elsewhere on the Shi’ar ship, Rachel is standing behind Charles Xavier with her hands at either side of his head. He is trying to teach her how to use her powers with more subtlety, but Ray is becoming agitated. She feels as if Charles is always trying to work on her and trying to get her to link up. Charles apologizes. He didn’t know how she felt about this. He stands and heads for the door, telling her that he’ll leave her to herself. Kurt could probably use a break anyway. Rachel asks him to wait. She didn’t mean it like that. </p> <p>She tells him that she’s just being grumpy. It’s not Charles, though; it’s their Shi’ar passengers. She’s pretty sure that they know who Charles is, and they are purposely keeping their minds blank, like they’ve had training. Charles thinks it’s likely they have. Then, adds Rachel, there’s the thing with that <i>Deathsquad</i> who put the deathmark on her back. For the last two days, it’s like she can feel it getting hot beneath her skin. They <i>know</i> that she’s in their territory. She feels that the Shi’ar Ministry is tracking her. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in space, a small craft approaches the X-Men’s larger ship. Piloting the vessel is Korvus, and he asks his computer if he can access their loading bay unnoticed. It confirms that he can, but stealth mode will cease once docked. Korvus thinks that’s good enough. Once he’s on board they’ll know it, regardless. The computer takes them in. </p> <p>Back inside the ship, Warpath is with the newcomer, Darwin. He doesn’t want to spar right now, and James tells him that’s fine - he just doesn’t want him to mope around. Darwin explains that he wishes he was there because of what he can do, and not because he shared a mind with Vulcan for a few days. That was the worst experience of his life. He couldn’t do anything but watch while one of his friends went <i>insane</i>. “Yeah… that sucks,” replies James. The two Shi’ar crewmen walk past and bid them good day. They’re heading to get some food supplies. As they wander off, James comments that they’re up to something. Darwin knows, but what? It’s not like they could take on the X-Men. </p> <p>At that moment, Korvus’ craft enters the larger vessel and the alarms sound. James grabs his knife immediately and asks Darwin to follow the Shi’ar, but to stay out of sight. He has some party crashers to bounce. Nightcrawler joins him, quickly followed by Havok and Polaris. Alex asks what’s going on, and Lorna wonders if the Shi’ar have sabotaged them. The answer comes in the form of Korvus who is carrying the Blade of the Phoenix. “Wow,” exclaims Warpath, “That is a <i>really</i> big sword.” </p> <p>Korvus asks them to stop. He means no harm to any but the girl who was touched by the Phoenix. But, he’ll do what he <i>has to</i> to get to her. Warpath leaps at him, but is knocked off course by the sword, which sparks with energy upon impact. As it strikes, Rachel screams and her body is flung along the length of the corridor she is in. As James falls, Korvus warns them that they should listen to him. They can’t beat the blade. Polaris asks what if she takes it from him, then. She tries to remove it, but the sword emits a surge of energy that topples her. “Kurt?” asks Alex, looking for a little leadership. “Plan 9?” he replies. Alex is happy to do that. He unleashes a blast of energy at Korvus, but he directs it back at him with the sword. Nightcrawler, too, is dealt with similarly as he teleports above their assailant. “I didn’t want any of this,” Korvus comments as he stands over the X-Men’s unconscious bodies. </p> <p>Charles Xavier is alone on the bridge. He tries to communicate with Nightcrawler to find out what’s happening, but he can’t get through. He turns to see the two Shi’ar crewmen standing behind him. He orders them to the loading bay to find out what’s going on, but one of them pulls out a weapon. “We will not be doing that… Charles Xavier, <i>traitor</i> to the Emporium.” </p> <p>Meanwhile, Rachel holds her shoulder, which hurts. She wonders what that was, and Korvus explains that it was him. She and his blade are linked. The deathmark on her back glows gold as he speaks. She looks up at him from her prone position and asks if he’s it. They only sent <i>one</i> of them this time? They underestimated me… <i>again</i>!” She unleashes a burst of telekinetic power at Korvus, sending him sprawling. He gets to his feet, still clutching the huge blade. She explains that as she has telekinesis, she doesn’t have to touch him to hurt him. She doesn’t have to get anywhere near his big honkin’ sword. Korvus wishes it were that simple. He aims the sword at Rachel and fires energy at her. Rachel is hurled backwards, and she is dazed and bleeding as she tries to come around. </p> <p>Korvus stands over and raises the blade above his head, ready to behead Rachel. “I’m sorry for this…” he says as he brings the blade down. Rachel suddenly kneels up and catches the blade between the palms of her hands as it descends. As she holds it, the sword links her mind with Korvus. </p> <p>The pair of them speak telepathically, as memories are ripped from their minds to be seen by the other. They show Korvus’ family being hunted down by the Shi’ar and exterminated in cold blood. They show another family member being flogged as he stands in chains. From Rachel’s memories comes the aftermath of the Shi’ar Death Commandos’ attack on her family, and a vision of the future as she serves as a hound for the government. They see clearly what the other has gone through, and Korvus yanks the sword away from Rachel. He runs his fingers along its blade and tells Rachel that it is weakened. She <i>took</i> some of its power. Rachel corrects him, telling him that the sword took <i>her</i>. The Phoenix knows her and likes her. </p> <p>As the blade glows with its silver energy, a similarly colored Phoenix symbol glows around her left eye. She reaches for Korvus who wonders what she is doing. She asks him to hold still. His implant is about to blow up and she has to take it apart… carefully. Moments later and it is done. Korvus stands and sheathes the giant blade. He is surprised that he came to kill Rachel, yet she saved his life. Rachel informs Korvus that he’s seen him. He is the final descendent of Rook’shir, and she knows he couldn’t have lived with himself if he’d done it. Korvus agrees, and feels that they are very much alike. </p> <p>As they speak, they hear an alarm sound. “<i>My ship</i>!” exclaims Korvus. He doesn’t think that Rachel’s colleagues are in any shape to go anywhere, but Rachel tells him it must be the Professor. She uses her telepathy to try and find him, and discovers that he is gone. The small craft vanishes into the darkness of space, with a determined-looking Darwin hanging on to the tail. </p>",

    "description": "<p><i>The Shi’Ar Empire is crumbling at the hands of Vulcan! The X-Men, with Professor X captured, search for the one group of heroes that can save them and all of the Shi’Ar...the Starjammers!    <br /></i></p>(Trell’eari - retreat for the Shi’ar High Council and royalty) <br />Amongst beautiful surroundings, Majestrix Lilandra Neremani, flanked by two guards, asks a young woman named Karanda where Chancellor Araki might be. She replies that he’s had a communication and has had to attend to something. She asks if everything is to her pleasing.  <p>Lilandra assures Karanda that everything is fine. Being there has helped her more than she can imagine. She stumbles as she mentions what happened to her, but Karanda assures her that her lips are sealed. Lilandra tells her it’s kind of her to say so, but she was kind of a mess. Cassandra Nova almost <em>destroyed</em> her mind. However, she thinks it may be time to return to her duties. Karanda thinks the chancellor will be pleased to hear it.  </p><p>Elsewhere, Araki communicates with Vice-Chancellor K’Tor, watching him on a large screen. He has given Araki news of Deathbird’s escape. Araki thinks that it couldn’t be one of their own that freed her, in case they failed. Still, he’s stunned at how quickly this has transpired. K’Tor asks if he will need assistance, but Araki chastises him, reminding him who he is speaking with. K’Tor apologizes.  </p><p>Chancellor Araki turns to see one of Lilandra’s guards approaching. Araki quickly draws a weapon and blasts him with it. He then shoots the other guard, as well as Karanda. Lilandra is shocked and asks what he’s done. Araki smacks her on the side of the head with the weapon and she falls to the ground, unconscious. Araki tells himself that he has given the empire a chance at greatness. It’s something <em>she</em> could never understand.  </p><p>(meanwhile, far, far away) <br />The X-Men discuss their options aboard their spacecraft, with Korvus in attendance. Warpath doesn’t trust Korvus, but Rachel reminds him that he was forced to do what he did. Korvus adds that if he meant to kill him he’d have done it before he came to. Warpath flips and storms towards him, but Havok steps in-between the volatile pair and order them to stop fighting. He figures Charles and Darwin are more important than their squabbling. He reminds James that Rachel has seen Korvus’ mind and she trusts him. That’s good enough for him. Even if he wasn’t, he’s the only one who can help them right now.  </p><p>When Nightcrawler asks how they’re going to catch his ship, Korvus replies that they can’t. It’s a jumpship, which means it creates its <em>own</em> stargates. Lorna is disappointed, but Korvus tells her that there may be another way, if she and Alex are what Rachel says they are. Alex asks what he means. Korvus explains that they can help them create a stargate of their own.  </p><p>“We can what?” exclaims Rachel. Kurt asks for an explanation, so Korvus informs them that it’s simple. Before they built the gates, Shi’ar cruisers like the one they’re on made their own jumps. They only have to bring the jump engines back on line, but they’ll need a power source. That’s what they will be. He, Havok and Marvel Girl will feed the engines, and Polaris will control them.  </p><p>Polaris asks what she has to do. Korvus explains that their power isn’t the fuel they were built for, so she has to stop it from ripping them apart and leaving them stranded outside space and time. Kurt half-jokes that it sounds serious. Korvus replies that it’s worse than that, assuming they survive. When they arrive, their most powerful members will be spent, and their impulse drive will be offline. He looks out the window, and adds that following their teammates where his ship’s coordinates were set is out of the question. They need somewhere safe to rest and refit the engines before they leap into the fray.  </p><p>“The Starjammers,” Nightcrawler suggests. Alex was going to say the same thing. The professor had their most recent location in the navcom, and he taps away at the computer. Korvus is surprised that they know the Starjammers. Rachel explains that Corsair is Alex’s father. Korvus grins, and says that maybe their luck is <em>not</em> all bad.  </p><p>(Shi’ar High Council Starways) <br />Near a massive spaceship, the two Shi’ar that kidnapped Charles Xavier approach warily. They are cleared for landing and are asked to prepare to be scanned. One of them tells the controller that they are not the ones they were expecting, but before he can complete his sentence, the scan reveals three people aboard the craft, and no Phoenix Blade. They are ordered to surrender, as they have illegally entered the High Council’s causeway and will be considered <em>hostile</em>. One of the men asks them not to fire. They have a gift for the Vice-Chancellor. It’s the Earther, Xavier. Behind the two men, Charles sits bound and gagged; uncertain of his immediate future.  </p><p>The controller asks them to hold position, and the two men chat. They are nervous about entering the craft but, when they are cleared for landing in bay seven, they are warned not to deplane in the hangar. They will be boarded. One of the Shi’ar thinks they will be killed for certain. His comrade replies that <em>he</em> is going to kill him if they don’t if he doesn’t be quiet. The craft slowly enters the hangar.  </p><p>Meanwhile, back on the X-Men’s craft, Polaris practices using her augmented powers by taking things apart. Alex asks if she thinks she’ll be able to do it. Lorna doesn’t know, but with all the training she did with Rachel and the Professor during their downtime, her new powers are beginning to feel as natural as the ones she lost. She remains optimistic about their chances. She wonders how long it will be. Alex hopes it will be soon. They’ve been working on the engines all day.  </p><p>Lorna points out that Alex has been a little distant since they decided to do this. She thought he’d be looking forward to seeing Corsair, in spite of everything. Alex replies that he is. It’s been a long time, however, and he doesn’t even know about Vulcan yet - his other son. On top of that, they’ve blown it at every turn. They get stuck in space <em>and</em> allow Charles to be kidnapped. Lorna points out that it was Charles who brought them onboard, but Alex says it doesn’t matter. He should have seen it. Now they’re running to his father for help instead of bringing it to him. All they have is bad news. Alex turns and walks out of the room with a lot on his mind. Lorna picks up some objects using her power and says to herself that Alex is twice the man Corsair is. If only he’d realize it.  </p><p>In the engine bay, Nightcrawler and Warpath have become spectators as the shirtless Korvus works on the engines. He tells them that it’s nearly ready, but he hasn’t worked on engines like this since he was a boy. James asks if his father was a mechanic for the empire. Korvus replies no. This was after his death, when he was in the slave workforce… before he became a man and was locked away. Kurt and James pause a moment before making their excuses to leave. Korvus assures them that he’ll finish it on his own. He can’t sleep anyway.  </p><p>As they walk away, Kurt says that is seems like Korvus has been through worse treatment than many of them. “It appears,” replies James. Kurt asks if he still does not trust him. James thinks that there’s something about him; a scent that he can’t place. He doesn’t seem suicidal, however, so he guesses he can be trusted with the engines. Kurt tells him that he worries more about Rachel, and the effect that he’s had on her already. She took some of the Phoenix Force from his sword within herself. Even the smallest spark of the Phoenix in Rachel Grey could be a danger to them all. It could be much worse for Rachel.  </p><p>Elsewhere on the ship, Rachel has nightmares about Korvus and the treatment he underwent at the hands of his slave captors. She wakes with a start and decides to get up. She decides to grab a bite to eat but finds nothing appetizing. Instead, she grabs something to wear and heads to the engine bay to see Korvus. When she arrives, she tells him that he’s in her head. He reminds her that she’s the telepath. Can’t she shut it off? She asks if it’s happening to him, too. Korvus admits that something is; ever since they merged minds through the Blade of the Rook’shir. Rachel tells him that it’s like she has pieces of his memories mixed with hers. She asks about the sword, wanting a reminder of how it’s connected to the Phoenix.  </p><p>Korvus holds the blade in an outstretched hand and it fizzles with energy, revealing an image of the Rook’shir along its length. He tells Rachel that, hundreds of years ago, Rook’shir was possessed by what was then called the Phal’kon. He was where the Shi’ar legends of the Phoenix truly originated. They kept the story quiet, but knew long ago that the energy could join with those it chose. Rachel says that she thought Jean Grey was the first person the Phoenix connected with. Korvus corrects her. There were two others, each ending in disaster. Rook’shir destroyed worlds. He had the Phal’kon in him for only a few days, and he killed so many.  </p><p>He adds that when they finally managed to slay him, a small piece of the Phoenix remained within his sword. But, it’s not the <em>true</em> Phoenix. Rachel agrees. To her, it’s more like a faded blue shadow, or an echo of it. Rachel touches the sword, and reckons it’s not such a bad thing. It’s a lot less power but it’s easier to control. Korvus thinks it’s <em>too</em> easy. When he first held the blade, it opened his mind to the lives of those who carried it before him. It taught him how to use it. Rachel reckons that even a shadow of the Phoenix wants to be used. She notices Korvus staring at her and asks him to stop looking like that. Like what? he asks. “Like you know me,” replies Rachel. Korvus says that he <em>does</em> know her. He shouldn’t, but he does.  </p><p>Rachel and Korvus approach one another, so close that Rachel has her hand on his chest. Korvus tells her that he even knows why she is there in the new clothes she made instead of sleeping. Rachel tells him to stop, but she’s not that convincing. “It’s the same reason I can’t,” he adds. Rachel turns and Korvus holds her gently by the shoulder. “Oh, God,” sighs Rachel, “We’re <em>really</em> in trouble now.” Korvus smiles and says that he’s known nothing in his life but trouble. They’ll survive. He takes her head in his hands and kisses her tenderly. Rachel reciprocates, stroking his hair as they embrace, as if it was always meant to happen.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Charles Xavier is now a captive of Chancellor K’Tor. He is strapped uncomfortably into a machine that holds his head in place. Charles grimaces from the pain and of the knowledge of what might come. K’Tor is standing before him, gloating about what is going to happen to him. He explains that the machine is called the ‘kiss of agony.’ Its touch sears right through the brain. He wouldn’t know personally, of course, and it’s not as if he’s about to try the device on himself. Charles warns him that Lilandra will have his feathers for this. K’Tor slaps him hard across the face. He tells Charles not to try and use his mind-control on him. The collar he wears prohibits those abilities. Charles replies that he doesn’t have those abilities anymore.  </p><p>The machine forces Charles’ body upwards and places him in a horizontal position. K’Tor asks for forgiveness if he doesn’t take him at his word. In any case, he adds, he won’t have those abilities soon. The machine is loaded with nasty-looking blades, syringes and all manner of devices with painful intent. Charles cries for him not to do this. Lilandra will <em>kill</em> him. K’Tor grins, and informs Charles hat she will do no such thing, because she’s as helpless as he is now. The machine goes to work, and Charles screams in agony. The two Shi’ar that brought him in are observing from a nearby viewpoint and have no stomach for torture. They decide to leave it to the professionals.  </p><p>As the retreat to their quarters, one of them remarks that his wife will be pleased with their reward. From a dark recess, Darwin observes them approaching and, once they are within range, he attacks. He delivers a crunching kick to the face of one of the hapless crewmen, and his colleague draws his weapon. He warns Darwin that, if he fires his blaster, every guard on the ship will come running. Darwin looks focused and not to be messed with. He replies that he has survived a jump through space holding onto the roof of their ship. If he thinks a blaster is going to hurt him, he’s dreaming.  </p><p>He turns sharply and shatters the weapon with his fist. He then punches the Shi’ar in the face, destroying his nose and covering his face with blood. The crewman asks what he wants from him. Darwin snarls, “I want my <em>teacher</em>… and you’re going to help me save him!” </p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Eat your heart out, Red Baron! The X-Men take to the skies to in a dogfight against their newest foes, the Children! It's non-stop action and suspense in this penultimate issue to Mike Carey's first arc on X-Men. Plus, discover the secret the Children are still hiding that will turn the X-Men's world upside down!</i></p><p>'Hard or easy, Creed…you’re going to have to take your medicine…’ Dr. Henry McCoy a.k.a. the Beast, one of the senior X-Men, tells the brutish Victor “Sabretooth” Creed as he stands before him holding a needle full of a glowing green substance. Chained, Creed warns the Beast that if he brings that anywhere near him there is going to be blood – and hair – on the walls, before suddenly roaring loudly and leaping up, now free from his shackles.</p><p>X-Men squad-leader Rogue warns Hank to look out, as Creed is free. The Beast pulls back and thanks Rogue, joking that it would have been his observation also, but that it is always good to have a second opinion. Karima Shapandar, the super-Sentinel remarks that embedding adamantium chains in a brick wall doesn’t work because any restraint device is only as strong as its weakest link. ‘Sounds like your X-Men, don’t it, darlin’?’ Creed asks Rogue as he throws his chains around her and drags her over to him.</p><p>Creed smiles wickedly as he asks Rogue who her weakest link is, as there seems to be plenty of choice around here. Suddenly, the room is lit up as Samuel “Cannonball” Guthrie blasts straight at the long-time X-Men nemesis. When Creed collapses to the floor, Sam remarks that a brick wall makes a neat restraint device all on its own sometimes. Rogue congratulates her teammate on a good job, to which Sam asks ‘Was it?’ and informs her that he isn’t feeling all that good about it, so he thinks they should just finish it.</p><p>The Beast holds the needle and reminds Rogue that he has his own misgivings, all of which are on record. Rogue declares that this is Sabretooth, so if they can put him on a tight rein forever they could be saving countless lives. ‘”<em>Could</em>”?’ That eases my conscience by the width of a toothpick!’ Hank replies as he injects the needle into Creed’s bare shoulder before taking his leave. As he departs, Rogue exclaims that there is more at stake here than Creed’s civil rights, to which Hank replies ‘There always is’ and informing Rogue that he will be in the infirmary if he is needed. ‘Someone else can clear up this mess!’ he adds, motioning to all the rubble in the room.</p><p>Out in the corridor, Hang hangs his head in shame, before noticing three of the X-Men students down the hall. Mercury exclaims ‘Oh wow! I’ve seen her in the X-Men mission logs!’ ‘Yeah? Not looking like this you haven’t!’ Rockslide exclaims grinning, while anole covers his eyes. Hank goes over to them and asks the students what it is he is missing – what new wonder has arisen to enchant and divert them. ‘Oh’. Is all Hank mutters when he sees what the students are looking (or not looking) at – Lady Mastermind!</p><p>The sultry blonde is out of her medical bed and carries her intravenous with her, her outfit not covering much of her body as she greets the Beast and tells him that she has got some questions, adding that he had better answer or else she is dropping the “Lady”.</p><p>Elsewhere at the Xavier Institute: ‘The verdict of history? What do you mean by that, exactly?’ asks Nathan Dayspring Summers a.k.a. Cable. ‘Precisely what I say, Cable – how does the future remember us?’ asks the diabolical Raven “Mystique” Darkholme, before asking, specifically, how the future judges the part they play here and now in protecting the remnants of mutantkind? The man from the future examines some diagrams and replies that history is short on specifics, but that it remembers broad movements, not individuals.</p><p>Mystique disagrees, exclaiming that an individual whose actions are pivotal will always be remembered, like Hitler, or Ghandi. ‘And you’d like to know which you are?’ Cable asks. ‘Hardly’ Raven mutters in reply. Cable turns to Mystique and reveals that her name does survive in the databases of his time, ‘It’s a generic term for a traitor – as Judas is now’. Cable asks if that helps her, to which Raven asks ‘A traitor? To who?’ .</p><p>Cable informs Mystique that it was two thousand years in his past, so it is just a folk legend, before telling her that she is distracting him from the task at hand, as he is trying to locate the Conquistador so they can – ‘Damn. Found it!’ he exclaims, announcing that is where the good news ends.</p><p>Meanwhile, aboard the ship in question, the Conquistador, the Children of the Vault have gathered. ‘Is it this easy to penetrate U.S. airspace?’ Perro asks. One of the others informs Perro that they are cloaked, invisible to radar and telemetry. Perro remarks that the people of the streets will seem them as the Conquistador flies over their city while the military will not. He remarks that they should make this easier for them and orders Serafina to drop the cloak. Serafina points out that they are still more two thousand miles from – Sangre interrupts, ‘I know. We tried to hide, but that option is now closed to us’ he states.</p><p>Sangre exclaims that they come now as executioners – of the mutants then the humans – whose world they need for their own expansion. ‘So lets announces ourselves with due solemnity!’</p><p>Back at the Xavier Institute, the Beast tells Regan Wyngarde a.k.a. Lady Mastermind, that if she makes any sudden or hostile moves he may have to forget his Hippocratic oath. ‘If I move at all, McCoy, this sheet is gonna slip – and your Hippocratic oath’s gonna take a real hit to the head – or parts south. Regan snaps back. Beast tells the original Mastermind’s daughter that she flatters herself, but she is not his type.</p><p>An image appears before the Beast and Regan tells him that this is the last thing she remembers, back when the Hellfire Club was still paying her bills. ‘So how come I woke up on a slab in Doctor Frankenstein’s lab? And why is my head full of that Southern-fried fool, Guthrie?’ Beast helps Regan along, holding up her sheet and tells her that he will explain inside. Regan declares that she wants to know what is going on here – is she a prisoner? Beast states that he will explain inside again. ‘Can we come too?’ Rockslide asks. ‘That would be a <em>no</em>’ the Beast replies. ‘Aww, man!’ Rockslide complains.</p><p>Anole asks if Lady Mastermind was the woman they found in a coma and points out that she seems a lot better all of a sudden. Rockslide mutters that Professor McCoy has got healing hands. Mercury tells Rockslide not to be so gross and, referring to Anole, to remember that some people are a little more delicate than he is.</p><p>‘What? No way. Just – no way! That’s not possible!’ Regan exclaims as the Beast reveals to her that she has been unconscious for more than a year. Hank informs her that the X-Men discovered her in a private hospital where apparently she was being held incognito by a person or organization named Pan, but that is all they know for now. Hank adds that as far as her memories of Cannonball go, a woman who calls herself Serafina hacked into Regan’s nervous system and used her illusion powers to get into Sam’s mind. ‘That may even have been what caused you to wake up’ Hank adds.</p><p>‘I’ve been on my feet five minutes and already I’ve got a hit list!’ Regan exclaims. ‘Life is good. Where’s this chick at now? Bring her to me!’ Before Beast can reply, Emma “the White Queen” Frost telepathically informs Hank that some O*N*E* soldiers have turned up with a corpse, so they want to commandeer his freezer. Hank tells Emma to send them down, and asks her to tell Rogue that there is someone in the lab she might like to talk to.</p><p>Back on the Conquistador, the fiery Fuego and the blonde Aguja watch the military planes close in on them. ‘A show of force!’ Fuego remarks. ‘No…their hands are empty!’ Aguja declares as she raises her hands and uses her powers to implode the aircraft. Fuego begins sending out bursts of flame, destroying more jets and asks his teammate if they should keep score. ‘Why bother? We both know I’ll win!’ Ajuga replies boldly.</p><p>In the hangar bay at the Xavier Institute, Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops rushes in and orders Rogue to stand down. ‘You got a problem, Scott?’ Rogue asks. ‘Several!’ Scott replies. ‘Starting with the fact that you’re taking Creed out of our custody!’ Rogue explains that Creed has been neutralized as the Beast injected him with Nano-Sentinels. ‘You know, those little critters Cassandra Nova used on you?’ Rogue explains that they are inert now, but that Cable or Karima can activate them in a heartbeat.</p><p>‘And that’s my second problem. Those things –‘ Scott begins before seeing Cannonball about to open the hangar door and tells him not too ‘- Those things are lethal. I didn’t even realize they were still in existence!’ Rogue points out that Beast keeps tissue samples from all of the X-Men, so they just had to go through the samples until the found one from that time period. Rogue adds that Creed trailed this trouble across their path, so it seems only fair that he takes his share of it. ‘Plus there’s no one better at staying alive than he is. He’s proved that!’</p><p>Cyclops tells Rogue that if Creed is taken dead or alive by the enemy then she has delivered a mutant weapon of mass destruction right into their hands. ‘Does that strike you as a viable strategy?’ he asks. ‘Does it even strike you as sane?’ Scott’s future-son Cable interrupts, informing him that the Conquistador is airborne and in U.S. airspace, adding that a combat situation is no time to start overruling his own squad leaders.</p><p>‘Nathan, please. This is X-Men business!’ Scott exclaims. Pulling up her hood, Rogue tells Scott that, right now, Cable is an X-Man and reminds Scott that he told her she could pick her own team – an independent strike force that could handle stuff in the field while the others guard the mansion. ‘No arguments. No limits’. Rogue stands by her squad of X-Men – Iceman! Cable! Mystique! Cannonball! Sabretooth! Lady Mastermind! Karima! And tells Scott that she has chosen them, so he needs to live with it.</p><p>Outside the mansion, Lexington is in his Sentinel and sees the X-Jet take off. Lex informs James “Rhodey” Rhodes and asks him if he wants him to take this one. The former Avenger known as War Machine tells Lex to stay put, to which Lex asks him if he is following the comms chatter from the Midwest through. James replies that it sounds like a nasty situation but that they cannot do anything until they are called in for – and until then it is the usual game of “follow the X-Men!”</p><p>Cannonball is piloting the X-Jet and announces that they have a lock – ‘They’re four hundred miles and closing fast – very fast. They’re heading straight for us!’ Mystique approaches Rogue, and addressing her as “Anna” declares that she wanted to thank her for the faith she has showed in her, adding that she knows she had her doubts at first. ‘But to go into battle at your side means a lot to me’. Rogue asks her “mother” if she think she chose her because she has faith in her. ‘I think on some level you still care about what we –‘ Raven begins to say, until Rogue interrupts and tells her that the truth of the matter is it’s the opposite.</p><p>Rogue informs Mystique that she chose her because she doesn’t trust her an inch. ‘Someone’s got to watch you and never take their eyes off you. Guess it comes down to me’. ‘Maybe that’s what you tell yourself’ Mystique remarks, to which Rogue declares that it is the gospel truth. ‘Then look me in the eye as you say it!’ Mystique exclaims. ‘Say what? You killed Moira. You passed a death sentence onto Sean when you cut his throat!’</p><p>Rogue adds that it doesn’t seem like too long ago that Mystique was trying to kill her either, before telling Mystique that if it makes her happy to share risks then she can have a blast, but that is all they are going to share. ‘And on mission time, you call me Rogue same as everyone else!’ Rogue leaves Mystique, who stands silent. No one says anything until Cable tells the others they should find something to hold onto as the Conquistador is on visual – straight ahead and not slowing down! On the Conquistador, Aguja exclaims to Sangre that this is a collision course, to which Sangre simply replies ‘Yes. It is!’</p><p>Back in the X-jet, Rogue asks Cannonball if he is ready. ‘Ready!’ the former New Mutant replies. Rogue turns to Lady Mastermind and asks her if she is also ready. Now dressed in a Hellfire Club style outfit, Regan is concentrating hard and mutters ‘It’s what you brought me for, right?’ before declaring that she is ready.</p><p>At that moment, the X-Jet collides with the Conquistador – but it is only one of Lady Mastermind’s illusions. Aguja is surprised, but Serafina suggests to her blonde teammate that she adjust her eyes beyond the visible spectrum. Serafina then remarks that the X-Men are already aboard, believing that they have the element of surprise on their side.</p><p>Indeed, Rogue and her squad are on the deck of the Conquistador, and Rogue asks Karima Shapandar what it is they are seeing. Karima announces that there are lots of life signs, lots of movement, but most of it below them and to the stern. Rogue asks Creed where they came from last time. Creed points to a panel in the deck. ‘There. It still smells of them!’ he snarls. Rogue tells Creed to step out of the way before telling Cannonball that it is all his.</p><p>‘Big door or a small door, Rogue?’ Sam asks. ‘Whatever you’re in the mood for!’ Rogue replies. Sam begins blasting towards the hatch, when suddenly he collides with one of the Children of the Vault! ‘They call me Perro, X-Man – “The Dog”!’ the bulky super being reveals, adding that gravity is his dog and it does tricks for him when he whistles.</p><p>Suddenly the other Children of the Vault appear and Fuego unleashes a blast of fire, which Iceman blocks with a wall of ice. ‘Bring them down!’ Fuego exclaims, adding that they can discuss the finer details of each kill later. ‘Is that how you spend your evenings? Mostly I end up watching reruns of <em>Friends</em>’ Bobby “Iceman” Drake remarks, when Rogue shouts ‘X-Men – engage!’.</p><p>As Iceman and Fuego face off, Fuego declares that it looks like this is a stalemate, ice against fire, before revealing that he draws energy from around him to fuel his fires. ‘You understand? I feed on you. Until there’s nothing left!’ he exclaims, when suddenly Bobby screams as his body shatters.</p><p>Rogue approaches Sangre who tells her that she cannot take his powers because they are based on technologies she couldn’t even comprehend. He suggests she surrender and earn a quick death. ‘Always wanted a loud one, myself’ Rogue replies, before remarking that if the five here are all of them then she has seen better. Sabretooth battles Perro while Cable and Lady Mastermind team up to fight Aguja.</p><p>Rogue begins blasting Sangre with her flame powers while Sangre apologizes for giving her the impression that this is all of them. ‘Five people do not constitute a race. We are, as you might say, the tip of the iceberg. Karima finds herself at the mercy of Serafina before Sangre points out that they have arrived at their destination, meaning the battle is over. ‘Or the skirmish, I should say’. Sangre tells Rogue that if her precious new X-Men represent the future of her species.</p><p>The X-Men see that the Conquistador has arrived at the Xavier Institute and Sangre exclaims ‘Watch them die, now – watch the future obliterated at a stroke – and then you can meet the rest of my family!’</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>It's fight night! The X-Men battle it out with their mysterious new foes, The Children, right above the Xavier Institute! And when the dust clears, what decision does Rogue make that will shake the X-Men to their core?!</i></p><p>The Xavier Institute, where founding X-Man Henry “Hank” McCoy, aptly dubbed “Beast” is working in one of the med-labs. Recording an audio file, Hank remarks that the coroners office is stopping by to collect their John Doe at a little after Noon, however, in the meantime, his own pre-autopsy observations are as follows: the age of the man is approximately sixty, found dead of unknown causes outside the mansion gates earlier today. Beast adds that “John Doe” was seen walking immediately prior to that, although his initial inspection suggests that he died at least seven days ago.</p><p>The soft tissues substantially necrotized and blood coagulated - so how does a dead man walk again? Beast decides to examine the central nervous system, and is shocked, uttering his trademark ‘Oh my stars and garters!’ as he discovers growth in the central nervous system - <em>post-mortem</em> growth in both brain hemispheres! Beast exclaims that there are structures here he has never seen, when suddenly, a telepathic message from Scott “Cyclops” Summers, via his lover and teammate Emma “the White Queen” Frost declares that he needs everyone out on the lawn as they have a code-red! ‘Where would we be without the daily crisis?’ Hank remarks to himself.</p><p>Out the front of the mansion, Scott and Emma stand with their teammates Logan a.k.a. Wolverine and Piotr Rasputin a.k.a. Colossus. Several of the students are with them, while the Sentinel Squad and a handful of Office of National Emergency soldiers are on hand also - and everyone’s attention is turned to the giant ship that is floating in the sky above the X-Men’s home. The sultry White Queen tells Scott that, with their lives being as surreal and hallucinogenic as they are, it has been a while since she felt the actual need to do serious drugs. ‘So that’s obviously now what it appears to be, Scott’.</p><p>Cyclops tells Emma that, if this is indeed the Conquistador, then it means Rogue failed. Scott announces that he needs airborne reconnaissance, and the student Pixie asks him to pick her, while Julian Keller a.k.a. the telekinetic Hellion exclaims ‘No way! I’m combat ready!’. Wolverine suggests to Scott that they hold off for a bit and see what the “toy soldiers” can do, referring to the Sentinels that are making their way to the ship.</p><p>James “Rhodey” Rhodes, the former Avenger known as War Machine, and current combat leader of Sentinel Squad tells squad to deploy in fly-trap formation, while Lexington comes in from behind the ship so it wont have anywhere to run. But the Sentinel controller Slayton has trouble when he experiences clear-air turbulence. Rhodes copies that and notes that it gets stronger the closer they get to the ship - when suddenly all of them are forced to the ground.</p><p>Cyclops remarks that the ship has some kind of repulsor field, while Emma informs him that they are psi-shielded too, she cannot ready anything. Scott orders the students into the basement and to close the blast doors, before telling the X-Men to get into their battle stations and assume the worst!</p><p>Meanwhile, aboard the Conquistador, Rogue and her team of X-Men - Iceman, Cable, Cannonball, Mystique, Lady Mastermind, Karima Shapandar and Sabretooth, are being held prisoner by the Children of the Vault. The X-Men are unable to act because a strange woman in a red outfit with some sort of globe around her head holds them in stasis.</p><p>The grey-skinned Sangre claims that there is no malice here in what they do, in fact if anything, they act out of a kind of compassion. He tells the X-Men that, instead of lingering for a few generations in slow decline, the X-Men must all die now, quickly, almost painlessly. Sam “Cannonball” Guthrie turns to Rogue and asks if there is any point in asking why they can’t just live together. Sangre explains to Cannonball that the strong drive out the weak, but that it was never the plan.</p><p>Sangre explains that the Conquistador was designed to be a time-capsule - set to open only when global catastrophe finally erased humanity. The powerful Serafina informs the X-Men that the energies unleashed by M-Day released them early - so now they must eradicate both mutants and the humans. Rogue assures the Children of the Vault that the X-Men will not let them do that, and jokingly offers them Jersey City, ‘But that’s our final offer.</p><p>Sangre reminds Rogue how just five of the Children of the Vault hammered the X-Men into the ground and asks how she thinks she will prevail against his entire kindred. Rogue answers Sangre’s question by offering him one last chance to surrender, and warning him that after that it could get ugly. Sangre is annoyed, and tells Rogue that he did her the courtesy of explaining why they have to die, but empty wordplay bores him. He orders Serafina to charge up and fire. Serafina does as she is commanded, looking towards the sun for her power, she selects her target - the mansion and the area around it, which she intends to cauterise to a depth of ten meters.</p><p>Back on the ground, Emma remarks that this does not look good. Cyclops unleashes a powerful optic blast, but the shield surrounding the Conquistador absorbs everything. He turns to Wolverine and Colossus, so the armored Russian mutant lifts up the bar-brawling Canadian X-Man and tosses him to the sky in their traditional “Fastball Special”, while Wolverine suggests that their enemy might have to drop that shield before they can fire on the mansion. Wolverine slams against the side of the boat, but cannot drive his claws in to hold on - so he falls back down to the ground - hard. Gathering himself as shards of concrete fall from him, he mumbles ‘Guess that’d be a no’ before exclaiming that he hopes Rogue has a “plan B”.</p><p>On the Conquistador, Sangre asks Rogue is she would care to watch. Her back turned from Serafina and Sangre, Rogue replies ‘Reckon not’, to which Sangre replies is a pity, for he is always impressed by the sheer spectacle of the sun catcher, when suddenly, the sun catcher explodes, much to the horror of Sangre. ‘Looks like the solar power’s out. You got anything that works on diesel?’ Rogue asks smugly, before she reveals that the X-Men cheated, as it seemed like the thing to do.</p><p>Rogue looks towards her “mother” Raven Darkholme a.k.a. Mystique as the former villainess morphs out of Cable’s form, and Rogue remarks that Cable should take most of the credit. Raven admits to Rogue that she was beginning to feel the strain, but adds ‘Though it is always nice to play with the phallic symbols’ and fires several shots at Sangre. Holes now formed in his body, Sangre reveals that they have stored power in their suits, that this changes nothing, before calling out to his brothers and sisters.</p><p>The Children of the Vault leap into action as Sangre orders them to be quick and cold. ‘Show no mercy!’ he shouts. Rogue remarks that there is an obvious emphasis on the quick, because once their “batteries” run down, then they are nothing more than “John Q” citizens, so all the X-Men have to do is wait. ‘Now this - this is my kind of show!’ Victor “Sabretooth” Creed, a deadly villain bellows as he tears the head off one of the Children of the Vault.</p><p>Serafina introduces herself to new X-Men recruit Karima Shapandar, a former humanoid Sentinel, and Serafina informs her that she can talk to machines, and takes control of Karima’s weaponry, blasting at Mystique. Sabretooth comes up behind Serafina and remarks that there is something special about killing women, though he doesn’t know why that is. Serafina reveals to Creed that he has machines in his blood, very tiny ones, and forces him to the ground, her wires connecting to him as she mocks that there is something special about killing misogynists.</p><p>Elsewhere aboard the Conquistador, Regan Wyngarde a.k.a. the sultry Lady Mastermind is trapped in a room, ‘N-no! Please don’t!’ she exclaims to two of the Children of the Vault, one of whom is Aguja, the other an obese man. Aguja and the fat man unleash their powers upon Lady Mastermind, only for them to destroy part of the room. ‘Wow! Just look at that! Turns out I’m not really here. You must be seeing things!’ Regan exclaims as she stands in safety behind a pillar.</p><p>Also in the room is Fuego, and Regan remarks ‘And I’m guessing so is your pal with the smoking habit!’, and while Aguja and the fat one stand defenceless, Fuego sees them as Lady Mastermind and Cable, and unleashes a powerful burst of flames onto them, burning them to a crisp. ‘Can you say “Friendly fire”?’ Regan asks.</p><p>Back on the deck, Cannonball goes over to Serafina, and addresses her as “Sarah” and tells her to get away from Sabretooth, for although he is scum, he doesn’t deserve to die. ‘I keep telling you, Sam, it’s Serafina!’ the powerful woman replies. Serafina tells Cannonball that he should have run as far as he could from this fight, as he might have lived to father real children. ‘We lived together for twenty years!’ Sam exclaims. ‘Twenty minutes!’ Serafina corrects him. ‘I loved you!’ he replies. ‘Yes. Because I told you to!’ Serafina reminds him.</p><p>‘Then none of it mattered. None of it was real. Thanks…that’s all I needed to know!’ Sam exclaims, before picking Serafina up and blasting all around the skip at an extraordinarily fast pace, before slamming Serafina down hard into the deck. He then returns to his teammates, all battling furiously against the dozens of Children of the Vault.</p><p>Fuego battles Rogue and asks her if she is done. ‘Rejoice in your fires. I bathe in them. They feed me!’ Fuego exclaims as his flames engulf Rogue, until suddenly, his flame becomes diminished. Rogue is fine, despite Fuego claiming that he absorbed her. When ice begins to form on his body, he sees Bobby “Iceman” Drake and snarls ‘I killed you!’ The founding X-Man replies ‘Yeah? Well I’m returning the favor!’ and shoves a huge ice shard up through Fuego’s body.</p><p>Sangre drips like liquid metal into the control room, then reforms his body, admitting that he underestimated the X-Men, though he believes not fatally. He remarks that the Conquistador herself is a weapon and needs no outside power source - ‘Mass, momentum and thirteen thousand gallons of fuel should be enough to finish this!’.</p><p>The ship twists in the sky, knocking everyone off their feet as the Conquistador floats towards the mansion. Cannonball blasts down to the roof, then back up to the underside of the Conquistador, pushing it upwards with the help of the Sentinels. ‘Good to see you, pal. Ain’t inertia a real kick in the teeth?’ the driver of the Sentinel asks. Sam replies that he appreciates the assistance but that ‘Nothing that looks like you is a pal of mine!’</p><p>Serafina survived Cannonball’s assault and enters the control room, where Sangre is surprised that she left the battle. ‘As did you, my brother’ Serafina points out. Sangre informs her that he had to key in a ramming maneuver, adding that if the mansion is destroyed, the X-Men will be destroyed also. Serafina smirks and holds a gun up to Sangre, then fires bullet after bullet into his body, which reforms quickly. Sangre realizes that this is not Serafina and remarks that whoever this is, they should know that bullets can not harm him.</p><p>Mystique reveals herself, telling Sangre that that is rather muddy thinking for the “master race”, as not all bullets are slugs of metal. Raven explains to Sangre that those bullets are thermite, which, just as a by-product, turn water into hydrogen as they detonate. ‘Enjoy!’ Raven jokes before firing bullets at the window in the control room so she can make her exit, while Sangre calls out to his brothers and sisters, that he needs their help, while Mystique tells Rogue to get the team off the ship. Raven is forced off the ship thanks to Sangre’s body blowing up behind her, though she is rescued by Iceman on one of his ice-sleds. Raven smiles at Bobby as she thanks him. ‘Hey, don’t mention it’ Bobby replies.</p><p>Later. ‘It’s just hanging there in the sky!’ ‘We could sell tickets!’, ‘We may have to. Garbage men won’t touch!’ are the remarks that go round now that the Conquistador hangs over the Xavier Institute like a bad smell. Sabretooth goes over to Sam and asks him if he took out that “piece of skirt” just to save him. ‘Pretty much’ Sam replies, to which Creed offers to pay Sam back with some inside information: ‘First time you turn your back on me, you’re dead!’</p><p>Cyclops and Emma go over to Rogue and Scott admits to Rogue that she does know how to pick a team after all, and welcomes her home. Motioning to Rogue’s dirty costume, Emma adds ‘And the look is you, too’. ‘Thanks, Emma, sweet of you to notice’ Rogue replies sarcastically, before remarking that you get a whole different perspective from way up there in the clouds. Then she delivers a surprising announcement. ‘We’re not staying. We just came to pack our things!’.</p><p>Epilogue: The Jungles of Ecuador, in the old Sentinel factory. ‘Be silent now. Hear me speak. Sangre is dead. And our brothers and sisters. <em>The X-Men killed them!</em> But in his wisdom, Sangre foresaw what would happen if we lost this battle - he saw two possible outcomes: success, and outright destruction. The Conquistador burned and it took our secrets with him!’ exclaims the woman who held the X-Men in stasis on the Conquistador.</p><p>The mysterious woman remarks that, in the hold, they had placed three thousand animal carcasses, gene-sculpted to resemble human bodies, which the X-Men will see, smell, and believe are the bodies of the Children of the Vault. The woman remarks that if they could not destroy the X-Men, then the X-Men had to be convinced they had destroyed the Children of the Vault so that they would stop searching.</p><p>‘So that the great plan could continue at its own pace! We will be ready soon, and I promise you this…they will not see us coming!’ the mysterious woman walks up some stairs with Perro at her side, and dozens more Children of the Vault behind her!</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Having barely survived their first mission as a team, Rogue’s squad immediately find themselves up against another new mysterious threat! What does the man called Pan want with the X-Men, and what is he willing to do to get it?!</i></p><p>Inside a dimly lit office in a high-rise building, a man stands in the shadows and remarks that he was beginning to think that they have over estimated “them”. ‘Pan! You startled me!’ exclaims a woman as she turns to the man called Pan. Pan remarks that at last they are moving, to which the woman tells Pan that they shouldn’t get their hopes up, as it has been a week since they raided the hospital. The woman adds that the X-Men are chasing something, ‘But it might not be you’ she tells Pan.</p><p>Pan addresses the woman as Turlow and mutters ‘Nonsense’ before asking her if she has backtracked their computer searches. Turlow replies that she has and that they cracked the discs very quickly, but that they are assuming a lot here. Pan replies that they are assuming that one of their American associates - Goynes, or Stuart - will crack. ‘That’s a near certainty’. Turlow asks what would happen if it isn’t “her” that comes - what if it is one of the other teams? ‘We break them down for parts. And throw out another hook!’ Pan exclaims.</p><p>Elsewhere, another dimly lit place, this time a bar, where a busty blonde woman is having a drinking competition with a man, while a dozen or so others watch and egg them on. The woman exclaims that she beat him by a nose. ‘That was incredible’ mumbles the slurring man. The blonde woman tells the bar tender to set up another round, this one’s on her. A friend of the man called “Stag” exclaims ‘You got beat by a girl! Her liver’s what, half the size of yours?’</p><p>The woman exclaims that, truth of the matter is, there was only ever one man who could beat her at this game - Calvin Goynes. ‘A hell of a drinker and a hell of a lover!’ some people in the bar turn to a handsome blond man and one of them shouts ‘Hey, Calvin! You never told us you was a love machine!’ Confused, Calvin exclaims that he doesn’t know - until he realizes what is going on. ‘Oh no…’ he utters, before rushing away.</p><p>The blonde woman leaps over the table, ‘Thanks, boys. It’s been fun!’ she exclaims before revealing her true identity as she calls out and asks if Karima is listening, that she has found Calvin and gives Karima the directions Calvin is heading in. Stag mumbles ‘Wait a second, you made us finger a friend?’ and angrily calls Lady Mastermind “Baby doll” and tells her that she is going to bleed. With her illusion gone, Regan Wyngarde stands before them in her X-Men costume and asks the men how they are at jungle warfare, and using her powers, makes the men believe that they are in a jungle with a tiger in front of them.</p><p>Regan begins attacking the men as she explains to them that that it is just an illusion - like the illusion that she drank all that liquor and that she paid for it with real money. ‘But hey, whatever gets the job done, right?’. After disposing of the men, Lady Mastermind rushes from the bar, using the X-Men’s communication devices to contact her teammate Karima Shapandar, who is flying overhead, Regan informs Karima that she ran into a little trouble and lost the rabbit. Regan calls Karima “Cybergirl” and gives her the location of Goynes.</p><p>‘Mastermind, my name is Karima Shapandar or Omega Sentinel. <em>Not</em> Cybergirl!’ Karima replies, before announcing that Goynes is in her sights, and radioing to Rogue, informing her that Goynes is crossing the lot up ahead of she and Iceman. Karima informs Rogue of where the gate is and advises her to take a right turn. Rogue runs along, with Bobby “Iceman” Drake following her on an ice-sled, and tells Karima not to worry, as the gate is right here - well, it is after she uses her flame powers to rip through the fence.</p><p>The four X-Men converge in the lot and Rogue grabs Calvin Goynes, telling him that they would like to talk about his last job at the Fordyce Clinic. ‘I sure hope you’re in a chatty mood!’ she exclaims.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the Conquistador, Westchester County, at an elevation of 800 Feet, high above the Xavier Institute. Nathan Summers a.k.a. Cable tells the X-Men’s leader Scott “Cyclops” Summers that he will be down in time for Beast’s meeting, as he and Cannonball are just finishing up here. Scott tells his sort-of-son that he is doing an amazing job here, as the last time he looked, the Conquistador was a burned out hulk. ‘With the combined resources of the X-Men, anything is possible’ Cable replies.</p><p>Scott remarks that, to be honest, he is amazed that the Office of National emergency are letting Rogue’s squad take the Conquistador. Cable explains that Mystique still has some contacts in the Federal Government and she called in a favor or two, adding that the O*N*E* are happy so long as they disarm the Conquistador and keep it out of U.S. airspace. Scott admits that is where he no longer understands, and asks why Rogue feels the need to take her squad away from the Xavier Institute. ‘It doesn’t make any sense. Now, of all times, we need to stick together!’</p><p>Cable assures Scott that it is not his decision, nor his team, and adds that he is only visiting, before pointing out that Rogue feels with the Sentinels here that there isn’t much freedom of action. Scott assures Cable that they will deal with the Sentinels when the time comes, to which Cable points out that, until then, the O*N*E* are monitoring the X-Men’s every move, so Rogue feels she will be more useful to the X-Men as a whole as a free agent.</p><p>Scott decides that perhaps it is for the best and points out that Sabretooth can stay here in their custody, which means he will not pose a risk to the students. Scott then turns to Sam “Cannonball” Guthrie and asks him if he is going along with this. Sam tells Scott that, honestly, it will be a relief for him, as since his brother died, this place has got too many memories for him. ‘Every time I walk through the door it’s like stepping on his grave’.</p><p>Scott tells Cannonball that Jay’s death took a piece out of them all. ‘Kind of you to say so’ Sam replies, to which Scott remarks that it makes it more important to keep faith with what Icarus died for. Sam tells Scott that each of them has their own way of doing that. ‘And Rogues, well, let’s just say it’s different from yours’.</p><p>‘Yeah! Do it! Scorch the scumbag! It’s five past payback time!’ Regan exclaims to Rogue who holds Calvin by the shirt and threatens him with a flame-ball in her hand. Iceman and Karima stand nearby also as Rogue informs Calvin that the natives are getting restless, and that they pulled his name and part of his address off a database that they found at the Fordyce Clinic, reminding him that the Fordyce Clinic was dissecting mutants on behalf of someone known as Pan. ‘I’d sure love for you to tell us why!’</p><p>Wide-eyed, Calvin replies that he can’t, ‘You don’t know what he’s like!’ Calvin exclaims before informing the X-Men that they closed up shop after M-Day. Calvin claims that he never did any of the cutting, just gene splicing from prepared samples. Karima takes hold of Calvin while Rogue removes on of her gloves, warning Calvin that the trail is going cold and as they are in kind of a hurry, this is his last chance. Calvin shouts that they can’t let her touch him. ‘You’re super heroes! You have to play by the rules or you’ll lose your licenses!’ ‘There are rules? Shoot. I wish somebody had told me that!’ Rogue touches Calvin Goynes, and his memories become hers.</p><p>In Flashback / Calvin Goyne’s memory:</p><p>‘No, wait, I’m still missing something. You’d infect the mutants - the subjects - with this virus?’ Calvin asks a man sitting before him. The man replies that he actually intends to infect himself with Strain 87, which is the whole point, and asks Calvin if he has heard of Mary Mallon. Calvin replies that he hasn’t, to which the other man informs him that Mary Mallon is the original Typhoid Mary. He explains that Typhoid Mary was a carrier of the S. Typhi virus and gave it to everyone that she touched. The man explains that he plans to be Typhoid Mary in reverse, and if the treatment works, he will give it to Calvin also.</p><p>‘So will I need a VISA?’ Calvin asks. The other man replies that he can come and go by Sea Eagle, so it will be an easy commute. Calvin calls the other man Doctor Palance, and tells him that he can’t wait, as what he is doing here is incredible and totally unique. Dr. Palance replies ‘Not totally’, and that inspiration comes from the strangest sources. ‘Remind me to tell you about it someday!’ he adds.</p><p>Present / Reality:</p><p>‘Well that’s a hell of a coincidence’ Rogue mutters as Goynes falls to the ground. ‘Anything useful?’ Iceman asks his team-leader. Rogue announces that she has found out who Pan is - ‘He’s Richard Palance!’ Bobby asks Rogue if she means the geneticist who used to be a friend of Professor Xavier’s. Rogue replies that Palance was more like a colleague of Xavier’s and reveals that she has met him once, way back, Professor X consulted with him on her “condition” when she first joined the X-Men. ‘Anything else?’ Bobby asks.</p><p>Rogue puts her gloves back on and informs her team that Goynes has got holes in his memory - big, ragged-edged ones, but that there is something called Sea Eagle. She repeats what she heard in her head - “You’ll come and go via Sea Eagle”. Rogue informs her team that she has a location over the East River and suggests they go take a look. As the team begins to take their leave, Karima asks Regan what she is doing. Kneeling beside Goynes, Lady Mastermind replies ‘Nothing’ before remarking that she is placing a few nasties way down in Goynes’ brain stem, reminding Karima that he cut pieces out of both of them. ‘Sweet dreams, Calvin. Like, never’ Lady Mastermind remarks to the unconscious Calvin as she walks away from him.</p><p>Back at the Xavier Institute, Cable, Cannonball, Cyclops, Emma “the White Queen” Frost and Dr. Henry McCoy a.k.a. the Beast have all gathered, and Henry informs his teammates that he has collated all the evidence they have managed to scrape together. ‘I’m hoping maybe one of you can tell me whether it adds up to a threat or a bad joke!’ Beast continues, remarking that a man walks two hundred miles to visit them and falls down right outside the front gates, dead. Beast reveals that after examining the man, he discovers eight days worth of organic decay. ‘He was dead when he started walking. That’s the punch line’.</p><p>Sam asks if they know who the man is, to which Beast replies that, the short answer is, he was nobody. ‘Name: Paul Brunner, profession: civil engineer’. Beast adds that Brunner lived in Hagerstown, where he was hit by a truck last Saturday and pronounced dead - ‘Then he got up and walked away!’ Cable remarks that this is very Twilight Zone before asking why it is the X-Men’s problem. Hank tells Cable that he is glad he asked, before turning to Emma and asking for a virtual environment, ‘You never know who’s listening in these days!’</p><p>Thanks to Emma’s powers, the quintet appear to be standing in Brunner’s brain, as Hank points out the interiors. ‘Nice. Roomy’. Emma jokes. ‘And recently redecorated!’ Hank points out, motioning to where some structures have no counterparts in the normal human nervous system. Beast motions to the ventromedial lobe, explaining that it controls emotion and reveals that Brunner’s had swollen to four times its normal size. Cable asks if they are talking about a mutation, to which Beast replies that Brunner’s DNA was homo-sapien, but his educated guess is that something hitched a ride in Brunner’s brain and moved all the “furniture” around until it felt comfortable.</p><p>Beast reiterates that Brunner walked here, the “parasite” got out and Brunner’s body fell down. ‘So ideally, I’d like to know two things. Where did this thing come from in the first place? And where is it now?’</p><p>Elsewhere, a warehouse behind a wire fence with a dirty old sign that says “Sea Eagle East” on it. A man in a lab coat carries some computer equipment and remarks that this is absurd leaving all this equipment behind. Several henchmen-like men are pouring oil everywhere, while another tells the man in the lab coat, Doctor Stuart, that he has to do what he is told, they all do. ‘But the waste! It’s criminal!’ the doctor exclaims. ‘Pan says what goes. Pan says what stays!’ the man exclaims, before ordering everyone to back off, as when he drops the match, this place is going to go up like - ‘Wait!’ someone shouts, interrupting the other man.</p><p>‘Wait for what, Kochanski?’ the senior henchman asks, pointing out that the place is all primed and ready. ‘I know!’ Kochanski replies, before putting out the match that the commanding officer lit. ‘Change of plan!’ Kochanski exclaims, to which the other man asks him what he thinks he is doing. ’Change of name, too!’ Kochanski exclaims as he kicks the other man in the stomach, before slamming his head to the ground. ’Mine’s Mystique!’ “Kochanski” announces, revealing herself as the shape shifting X-Woman.</p><p>The other henchmen race to attack Mystique, when Iceman arrives on an ice-sled. ‘This looks like a job for the X-Men!’ he shouts. ‘Cue music and titles! He jokes as he goes about covering the men in ice. Mystique returns to her default blue-skinned, red-haired form as she tells Iceman that one of the first-year students could have taken this opposition. ‘Whoever Pan is, he can afford better help!’</p><p>Rogue, Lady Mastermind and Karima join the “party” and Rogue exclaims that back at the Fordyce Clinic, the henchmen fought the X-Men almost to a standstill, so she doesn’t mind if it goes down a little easier this time. Iceman asks Rogue what it is they are looking for, to which Rogue replies that they are looking for locations, for if Pan is holding other mutants, they have to find out where, and if they can find out where he is operating out of, then that’s a bonus.</p><p>Lady Mastermind suddenly kicks one of the henchmen <em>hard</em> in the face, so hard that blood pours from his mouth. ‘What? He moved!’ Regan exclaims. Rogue tells the rest of the team to go inside, as she wants to have a little talk with Lady Mastermind. Mystique, Iceman and Karima walk away as Rogue asked them to, and Rogue turns to Regan, ‘I’m giving you the benefit of a whole lot of doubts’ she tells her. ‘So? You looking for gratitude?’ Regan replies. ‘Not hardly’ Rogue snaps back, before telling the daughter of one of the X-Men’s deceased enemies that she just wants to get a couple of things straight.</p><p>Firstly, Rogue reminds Lady Mastermind that she is only here because of her personal stake in this, and secondly, she is only wearing that uniform because her wardrobe amounted to one white sheet. Lady Mastermind stands her ground and doesn’t look at Rogue while she is being told that while wearing the uniform, she must behave like an X-Man. ‘Or so help me I will rip it off your back and you’ll walk home naked!’ ‘Like to see you try, girl!’ Regan mutters as Rogue goes to join the others.</p><p>After a moment, Lady Mastermind joins them too, and Rogue orders everyone to spread out, as they have a lot of ground to cover. Iceman suggests that they don’t turn the lights on, as this whole place stinks of kerosene. ‘You look better in subdued lighting, anyway’ Mystique tells him. ‘Yeah, I get that a lot!’ Iceman mumbles. Raven picks up a file containing a bill of landing and some customs dockets. ‘They had their cover nailed down tight!’ she points out.</p><p>Rogue and Karima approach some strange machinery or equipment and Rogue asks Karima if she has any guesses as to what this might be. Karima replies that she is reading higher temperature and humidity on the far side of the arch, ‘It’s almost certainly a teleport gate!’ Suddenly, Rogue exclaims that they have been suckered. ‘What do you mean? Karima asks. Rogue points out that if they had a teleportation device, why would they be leaving in a truck? She quickly asks Karima to shut it down, but it’s too late, as several deformed creatures appear.</p><p>‘Plague dogs…you’re off the leash!’ one of the fleshy creatures exclaims. Another of the creatures warns Rogue that she cannot use her fire powers unless she wants to burn her friends. ‘You think I’m gonna be needing them sugah? Seriously?’ Rogue asks as she punches the creature, only to her horror, she finds herself caught in its fleshy being. ‘Seriously - we had you from the moment you walked in here!’ the creature exclaims.</p><p>‘X-Men! We need support! This is an ambush!’ Karima shouts as she unleashes her powers on more of the creatures, only to get taken down herself. The creature, who is addressed as Lupus tells Rogue that her powers wont work on them because they are too far from the human template now. Another of the creatures informs Lupus that more of the X-Men are coming, to which Lupus remarks that they will come too late, as they have got who they need now. He orders the beacon to be triggered, and the other three race onto the scene, Lupus and the other creatures teleport away with Rogue and Karima.</p><p>Elsewhere, Rogue lies on the floor and regains consciousness when a voice above her exclaims ‘Such a pleasure to see you again, Rogue - although much has changed since we last met!’ Rogue sits up and sees Dr. Palance standing before her, remarking that a pandemic is a disease that wipes out civilizations. ‘My aims are modest - but for you, the end will be the same result!’</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Mike Carey (ULTIMATE FANTASTIC FOUR) and Chris Bachalo (UNCANNY X-MEN) take over the X-Men, or at least what’s left of them! As old threats are still having their effects, new, more deadly threats emerge from the unlikeliest of places. Threats that spell doom for the X-Men. Plus, what could possibly strike terror into the heart of...Sabretooth!? And who are The Children? This is the book you’ve been waiting for! A perfect starting point for any new reader!</i></p><p>Alaska, specifically at the S.H.I.E.L.D. secure holding facility designation Utopia. ‘Seven months or seven years, Gallagher, I’m afraid you’re still going to get the same answer’ a scientist exclaims to his colleague, before remarking that ripping things apart is a lot easier than putting them back together, and that the Hand did well. ‘Our best decontamination scenarios have no effect on this subject!’ The scientist motions to the monitors and points out that what is being shown are some highlights from last weeks tape.</p><p>(On video)</p><p>‘To kill! To kill and then to die! For my master’s glory! For the humbling of man and the ending of days!’ exclaims a very distraught man.</p><p>(Reality)</p><p>Sitting at a desk covered in computers and equipment, one of the scientists asks if they can increase the time compression. The other scientist replies that their subject is living a month of subjective time for every hour in the simulator, and thinks that any more than that and - suddenly he stops mid-sentence. The first scientist asks him what is wrong, to which the second exclaims that the wall he is touching is hot. ‘Well, we are over a thermal vent’ the first scientist points out. The second reminds him that they are also insulated to a tolerance of eight hundred Celsius.</p><p>The second scientist radios to Colonel Chambers, informing him that he thinks they are under attack, when suddenly his entire body goes up in flames, followed by his fellow scientist. A quintet of strange beings enter the lab through a scorching hole in the wall, and the grey-skinned man known as Sangre thanks the flaming Fuego. Sangre addresses the dark-haired woman as Serafina and tells her to get to work, assuring her that they will make sure she is not interrupted.</p><p>But suddenly, a troop of guards enters the lab, and one of them orders ‘FREEZE!’ The large bulky man asks Sangre if this makes things worse, as all these men have seen them. Sangre addresses the bulky man as Perro and exclaims ‘Perro, all these men are about to die!’ Adding that Serafina will take care of any digital evidence. Sangre uses his powers, causing small bubbles to appear around all of the soldier’s heads and he remarks that Sabretooth, on the other hand, has remained stubbornly alive, ‘And he knows - as the expression goes - where we live!’ After Sangre’s powers have done what they were supposed to, he remarks that this is curious, as death by drowning is meant to be peaceful - which was obviously not the case for the soldiers. ‘I’m sure that’s a big issue for all of us’ the young woman with fabulous blonde hair replies.</p><p>Serafina stands by the mysterious man who is strapped up to the wall, a contraption covering his face and body, and Fuego asks her if she has everything that she needs. Serafina replies that this machine runs total immersion scenarios, so once she interfaces with it, she will be able to generate her own. The young woman concentrates, then announces that she is in, ‘Now what should I wear, do you think?’ she asks. Suddenly, Serafina has interfaced, and appears in a dank, dark dungeon, where a naked man huddles in a corner. As a brilliant light appears behind him, he turns to it, and sees a blonde woman wrapped in cloth, and Serafina, in disguise, replies ‘I am your guardian angel, Jean-Paul Beaubier. And I have come to raise you up - that your enemies may be brought low!’</p><p>Meanwhile, in Westchester County, New York, at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. Three members of the mutant heroes known as the Uncanny X-Men - Rogue, Emma “The White Queen” Frost and Bobby Drake a.k.a. Iceman are currently interrogating a chained Sabretooth, who is a constant thorn in the X-Men’s side. Victor Creed, as he is also known, declares that he is talking to Xavier and no one else, adding that they shouldn’t try pulling anything on him, as he knows Xavier’s scent. Emma reminds Creed that she has already told him his request is not possible, and warns him that he is starting to try her patience.</p><p>‘Is that right, sweetheart?’ Creed replies mockingly, before asking Emma if it more a case of her being rattled because she cannot read him. Rogue offers to soften Creed up a little by broiling his brain inside his skull. Emma doesn’t even respond, to which Rogue mutters ‘Just a suggestion!’ Creed smirks and stares Rogue right in the face, telling her that she is big and brave when he is on a leash, otherwise - ‘Otherwise it’d be a whole different kind of conversation, Creed!’ exclaims the handsome Bobby as he transforms into ice-form and leaps on Creed, with a jagged piece of ice pointed at Creed’s stomach, Bobby adds ‘And you’d be holding up your half of it with punctured lungs!’</p><p>Iceman holds the sharp ice up to Sabretooth’s face, though the deadly mutant just tells Iceman to get him “Charley-Boy”, as it is the organ-grinder he wants, not the monkeys. The three X-Men depart the holding cell, and Bobby admits to the women that his show of force was unnecessary and uncool, and apologizes for it. ‘We’re hardly operating under Geneva Protocols, Robert’ Emma replies, adding that if it comes to that, then they have no right to detain Creed in the first place. Emma explains that, if anything, she was hoping either Bobby or Rogue might have made Creed angry, for in the past, rage has caused him to drop his mental defenses.</p><p>Rogue asks Emma if she got anything, to which Emma replies ‘Not much’, but that he was in Nogales yesterday - the same Nogales where some madman obliterated an entire city block. Emma is certain that Creed didn’t see the destruction, but that it left echoes in his mind, and beyond that, all she is reading from him is pain and exhaustion and fear. ‘Pain? You sure about that, Emma?’ Rogue asks. Entering an elevator, Emma replies that she is, and explains that Creed’s healing factor has been slowed by about ninety percent. ‘But I have to admit - it’s the fear that’s exercising my mind’.</p><p>Back in Alaska, Serafina is still linked up to the interface, and after using her abilities to search for information in one of the computers by linking up to it, she reveals that there are 275 active personnel and 18 visitors present. Fuego exclaims that they are all dead, so the checks are exact. He then asks about the security systems. Serafina replies that she isolated the base as soon as they were within scanner range, assures Fuego that nothing came in and nothing went out. Motioning to a monitor which displays the X-Men walking around the complex, Serafina reveals that she also ate most of the data from the base system, leaving only a few misleading images - and the trail points to the X-Men.</p><p>‘And Northstar? Can we use him?’ Fuego asks. Serafina replies that she believes so, and that if Northstar kills Sabretooth for them, and along the way he can kill his former comrades too. She informs her cohorts that the Hand have filled Northstar to the brim with hate, so that’s all the motive he needs. Serafina looks at Northstar, still tied up, and adds that she has given him a little sweetener too - the sweetest there is.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Xavier Institute, Professor Charles Xavier himself, no longer a mutant thanks to M-Day, watches over and over again the news report of the destruction of Nogales, where the only survivor, a small girl, said that an angel told her the X-Men did it. Standing across from Xavier’s desk is high-ranking government official, Dr. Valerie Cooper - current Director of the Office of National Emergency, member of the National Security Council, former liaison to X-Factor, and long term supporter of the X-Men and mutants in general - tells Charles that the O*N*E* are looking for some answers here.</p><p>Samuel “Cannonball” Guthrie sits on a sofa as Xavier tells Dr. Cooper that he understands that and asks if sending the O*N*E*’s Director to get them is meant to flatter, or intimidate him. Valerie asks Charles if he thinks this is funny, and reminds him that an entire city block was erased ‘Not by an explosion, but by - well, you tell me!’ Val informs Xavier that the crater is a perfect hemisphere, and that buildings have been sheared off clean as if by - ‘By a point of singularity! An artificially generated black hole’ Charles exclaims, interrupting Val. ‘I follow your thoughts, Val. At least, until they magically turn to me and my X-Men’.</p><p>The good Doctor reminds Charles that he has seen the tape, that these lunatics were flying under the X-Men’s colors. ‘True or false, that’s not likely to have been random!’ Charles gets to his feet and points out that O*N*E*’s Sentinels log all of the X-Men’s comings and goings, and he assumes that Valerie has consulted that log, and that it has naturally established the X-Men’s innocence. Val reminds Charles that the X-Men have been able to dodge Sentinel Squad’s surveillance before, adding that she would bet he could even tweak their memories so they didn’t realize he had gone for the hat trick.</p><p>Charles informs Valerie that he doesn’t have those powers anymore, and that even if he did, the Sentinels are all shielded, so it is not the answer. ‘Probably not’ Val replies, before asking Xavier if she can interview Sabretooth. Charles assures Valerie that once she has the necessary authorization she can, adding that they cannot compel Sabretooth to talk to her. ‘This stinks on ice, Charles. And that expression on your face isn’t one I ever expected to see there. You’re enjoying this!’ Valerie exclaims. Charles turns from Val, asserting that his people are innocent. ‘Until proven <em>guilty</em>. I’ll let myself out!’ Valerie exclaims, before leaving Xavier’s office and slamming the door, hard, behind her.</p><p>After Valerie has left, Cannonball exclaims, ‘Okay, I guess that’s a wrap! As you were,<em>Mystique</em>!’ With that, Xavier’s form begins to shift, and he is replaced by that of Raven Darkholme, Mystique, who was impersonating the professor the whole time. The sultry villainess-turned-X-Man informs Guthrie that she found the imposture degrading and did not see the point. Sam smiles and tells Raven that it gives Professor X and the others a head start, adding that it was Cyclops’ idea. ‘Gotta get into that team spirit if you’re gonna be an X-Man!’</p><p>‘Am I to be an X-Man? The rumor mill unaccountably misses me out’ Raven remarks, before asking who drew the short straw. ‘Rogue. Way I hear it, she asked for you!’ Sam reveals. ‘Are you <em>serious</em>?’ Raven replies. ‘Well you know what they say. Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer!’ Sam exclaims. ‘And which am I?’ Mystique asks. Sam turns back to her from the door he is about to close, and smiling, he replies ‘You tell me, Raven. It gets a little tough keeping score around here!’ Mystique does not look impressed by that last comment.</p><p>Interlude: Deep Space, aboard the Shi’ar scout ship, Arna’rail. The Captain asks his crew member at the monitor why they sounded an alert. The monitor operator replies ‘Standing orders, Captain’, reminding him that anything that cannot be explained must be considered a threat. The Captain asks the monitor if this is her first voyage through the gates, and informs her that that is an order which is quietly forgotten, ‘The void is filled with what we can’t explain!’ The monitor operator remarks to the Captain that something small - as small as a man - flew past them, heading away from the Terran Gate, and now something very big is moving in from the opposite direction - ‘Towards Earth, and towards us!’</p><p>The Captain asks how the “second something” reads, to which the young officer replies ‘Like - nothing, Captain!’ the young officer replies, explaining that it is a net of energy so faint that it can be barely sensed at all, but that it is extended across a vast distance. The Captain frowns, before asking his officer if she believes in Sharra and K’ythri. ‘Y-yes, sir. Of course, sir. Why do you ask?’ the young officer replies. ‘No reason. But that belief may give you some slight comfort. As an atheist, I face death with wholly negative emotions’. With that, the strange large mass, what seems to be some pink form of energy, engulfs the Shi’ar vessel, ripping it apart.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Selkirk, Western Canada. ‘The cards are on the table, Jeanne-Marie. It’s all up to you now’ a voice remarks. A gun sits at a desk in a messy room. The bed is unmade, clothes and papers are strewn across the floor. Empty liquor bottles lie by the rubbish bin, and bottles of pills sit on the desk. ‘So - there’s a mission? Is that? Another mission? Something for me to do?’ Jeanne-Marie Beaubier, a.k.a. the super heroine known as Aurora, formerly of Canada’s premiere super heroes, Alpha Flight.</p><p>‘Something for all of us to do. You - me - Aurora. We have to have full agreement on this!’ Aurora says, continuing to have a conversation with one of her personalities. Taking the gun, Aurora puts it to her head. ‘Everyone has to play their part. Otherwise it’s just going to get worse. And worse. Until - ‘ Jeanne-Marie is cut off mid sentence, as something smashes into her room. Startled, Aurora fires the gun, but her hand jerks upwards so it does not hit her head. ‘This is not your time to die, Jeanne-Marie. Far, far from it!’ exclaims her twin brother, Northstar, dressed in his original costume as he stands beside her and declares ‘This is the day of your rebirth!’</p><p>Elsewhere - at the Camara Roja Vault, which has the current location of 620 West, 1200 North. Fuego, Sangre and the blonde girl stand together, and Sangre tells his comrades that they have done well today, but that S.H.I.E.L.D. is far from the strongest opposition they will face, though of course they are no push over. ‘You rose to the occasion magnificently’. The blonde girl with fabulous hair asks if that is why Perro and Serafina get to go and play with the X-Men - ‘While we come home early and say our prayers?’ Addressing her as Aguja, Sangre asks the young woman if she thinks this is a game. ‘Yes. A zero-sum game. One spin, one winner!’ Aguja replies. Sangre remarks that if it is, the prize is species-survival - ‘So we must make very sure that the humans and the mutants lose!’</p><p>Back in Westchester, ‘Welcome back, Miss Shapandar - how many fingers am I holding up?’ asks the Beast as Karima sits up in her bed. ‘Three, which is your full compliment, Dr. McCoy’ Karima replies, before remarking that a more pertinent question would be ‘Where are my clothes?’ As Karima wraps a blanket around her, Hank informs her that she didn’t have any when she came in, and asks if it was a wild night. ‘Mus have been. My internal clock is off by thirteen weeks!’ Karima replies, before remarking that someone did a real number on her, and asks the Beast if he has any ideas about who.</p><p>The Beast turns to Rogue, who informs Karima that she was being held at the Fordyce Clinic and that she had been partially dismantled. Rogue adds that the name “Pan” was mentioned, and asks Karima if it means anything to her. Karima replies that she doesn’t think so, but that she does remember the Fordyce Clinic, as she heard a call for help, it was telepathic, weak enough to be called subliminal, so she followed it. The Beast and Rogue turn to the bed next to Karima, where a young woman is lying hooked up to various life-support tubes, and the Beast suggests that it could have come from Karima’s fellow inmate, Regan Wyngarde, adding that Regan was a very powerful tele-sender, and even comatose that would still be true.</p><p>Rogue asks Hank if he thinks any of this is tied to what went down in New Mexico, to which the Beast replies that, given the time frame, it is unlikely, then asks Karima if she was in Nogales recently. The Super-Sentinel replies that she cannot say for certain, but she doesn’t think so, adding that for the last three months she has been - suddenly, she turns quickly, and her mechanical hands are ready with a charge as she confronts Wolverine a.k.a. Logan who has walked up beside her. ‘A little hair-trigger there, aren’t you, darling? Remind me never to come up on your blind side again!’ Logan jokes.</p><p>Karima sits back down in bed and apologizes to Logan, telling him that it was just instinct. ‘Instinct I can get behind. Programming - not so much’. Rogue asks Logan if he is here to talk to her, to which Logan replies that he is. ‘Fine. I was expecting you sooner, to be honest’ Rogue remarks. Logan tells Rogue that she should have come to him when she decided to keep Creed here, and again when she started to question him. ‘You scared I’d want to start cutting pieces out of him?’</p><p>‘Don’t you?’ Rogue asks. Logan replies that it doesn’t matter a damn if she thinks she can handle it, before telling her that when it turns out that she is wrong, ‘You know how close you are to the ragged edge?’ There is a pause, before Logan pops one claw right in front of Rogue’s face. ‘<em>That</em> close? Lordy!’ Rogue exclaims.</p><p>Outside, Perro looks over at the Sentinels and remarks to Serafina that he has always wanted to fight one. Serafina tells her companion that it is a fight which is not for today, as it is safer to work through their proxies - ‘Who’ve never seen our faces or heard our names’. ‘Safer, but less satisfying’ Perro replies. As Serafina adjusts the helmet on Northstar, Perro remarks that it is also less certain that they don’t have their resources. Serafina informs him that she has altered their DNA in some interesting ways, and repaired some of the grosser breaches in Aurora’s mind.</p><p>The French-Canadian twins stand motionless as Serafina exclaims that she is going to steal them a little extra power - just to shift the odds a little. With that, Serafina seems to warp space itself, and the sun becomes completely covered with darkness. Serafina turns to the former Alphans, and after removing their helmets, she declares that the mission begins. ‘Go. Do what <em>must</em> be done’. With that, the twins speed off.</p><p>‘The Hell? You think it’s an eclipse?’ asks someone on the grounds of the Xavier Institute. ‘This is no eclipse!’ someone else replies. Inside, Cannonball and Iceman are watching television, and Sam “Cannonball “Guthrie asks what happened to the TV - power outage? Bobby “Iceman” Drake opens the curtains and looking outside points out that they have four power generators, before suggesting that they go check on the X-babies, when suddenly, Northstar and Aurora come smashing into the room. Iceman is shocked at seeing the man who once had a crush on him, and exclaims ‘Northstar! What the Hell are you doing here? You’re supposed to be - I mean, I was there when you…’.</p><p>Bobby’s words trail off, but an unemotive Jean-Paul replies ‘Death is a state of mind, Drake. A test of will. You come out of it like a slingshot stone, with a new trajectory, a new momentum. Let me show you!’ With that, Northstar and Aurora stand firmly as the room around them goes up in flames - and Iceman explodes!</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Northstar and Aurora are back! Awoken by a mysterious new threat, the twins have been let loose in the Xavier Mansion, leaving a path way of destruction and death. Their mission: Kill Sabretooth!</i></p><p>The Xavier Institute… ‘Serafina? What are you doing?’ Perro asks the enigmatic and powerful woman. Serafina replies to her well-built companion that she is watching through the X-Men’s own security cameras. She reminds Perro of Sangre’s orders - to cover their tracks by killing Sabretooth - so they can then move on, at their own pace, with the grand design. Serafina adds that, so far, she thinks it is going very well. Serafina points out that the X-Men couldn’t anticipate the enhanced powers they gave to the Beaubier twins, so the X-Men think they know what they’re dealing with - which is a fatal mistake.</p><p>Jean-Paul and Jeanne-Marie Beaubier a.k.a. Northstar and Aurora respectively. They are founding and long-serving members of Canada’s premiere super hero team, Alpha Flight. Long separated since Northstar joined the X-Men and Aurora was captured by Weapon X, the mutant twins have recently been reunited - to kill the X-Men. A mighty explosion destroys a room at the Xavier Institute - a room with two members of the X-Men in it - Sam “Cannonball” Guthrie and Bobby “Iceman” Drake. Not only is Iceman Northstar’s former teammate whom he had a not-so-secret crush on, but Iceman is currently being blown apart.</p><p>Serafina confirms to Perro that Iceman is down, but Cannonball has escaped by using his powers to shield himself from the explosion as he blasts into open air above the Institute. However, Serafina isn’t concerned by this, as she doesn’t believe Cannonball represents any real threat.</p><p>Back inside the mansion, Wolverine a.k.a. Logan, Piotr “Colossus” Rasputin, Scott “Cyclops” Summers and Emma Frost, the White Queen, have gathered and march down a hallway. Logan asks Cyclops what is going on, to which the X-Men’s mighty leader explains that the perimeter has been breached, there was a twelve second power black out and a scream that sounded like Bobby. Scott is about to tell his teammates to keep the students back until they know what is going on, when Cannonball comes careening through the window and crashes into Colossus.</p><p>His clothes torn by the explosion, Cannonball informs his teammates that it is Northstar and Aurora and that they seem to be out for blood! ‘Don’t ask me how he’s not dead or what they’re doing here!’ Cannonball suggests to Emma that she lock onto the twins before they move, but that means Emma has to switch out of her diamond-hard form to use her telepathy. All witnessed by Serafina, Emma’s body responds to her will within a hundredth of a second - but to the Beaubier twins, at their current power levels - that is a window as wide as the world, and they race into the hallway and knock the White Queen to her feet. The speed of light is 186000 miles per second. The speed of the servos in Cyclops’ visor is considerably slower. Northstar steps into the gab and exploits it elegantly, causing Cyclops’ optic blast to ricochet all around the hallway.</p><p>Standing outside, near the Institute, Serafina remarks to Perro that it has been twenty-seven seconds since they sent the twins in, and that she was expecting better, before seeing on the cameras that, at last, Northstar is moving to the primary target while Aurora mops up the last of the remaining opposition.</p><p>Back inside, ‘Mr Beaubier! Wait!’ exclaims the student Victor Borokowski a.k.a. “Anole,” extremely surprised to see the man he once admired, Anole explains that he was coming to see what all the noise was about, ‘I can’t believe this! You’re alive!’ Excited, Victor asks if what happened to Northstar was all part of some plan or something. Jean-Paul stops in his tracks outside a secure room. ‘Victor,’ Jean-Paul says. ‘You were working undercover? You could have told me!’ Anole exclaims. Jean-Paul tells Victor that it is good to see him, but that he must leave him, as there is danger. Victor puts a hand on Northstar’s back, only for the confused Northstar to elbow Anole in the face, causing his former pupil to fall to the ground unconscious.</p><p>‘Focus!’ exclaims Jean-Paul, clutching his head before ripping open the doors to the vaulted room. But before he can get much further, ‘Sorry about the bare knuckles, Jean-Paul!’ Rogue exclaims as her gloveless fists punch him in the face. Jean-Paul falls to the ground as Rogue remarks that if the power goes out, someone has to come down here and evacuate the cells. ‘Guess you forgot that’ Rogue mutters before telling her former teammate to not bother getting up, for even if he can, she has taken all his speed. Northstar does get to his feet and reveals to Rogue that the angel that sent him here gave him more than enough power to finish the job. ‘And she promised me the joys of Heaven when I’ve killed you all!’ Rogue replies by telling Jean-Paul that he will sure as Hell have to earn them.</p><p>Back outside, Perro asks Serafina what is happening, reminding her that he cannot splice his consciousness into machines like she can. Serafina replies that Northstar has engaged Rogue, while Aurora is finishing off the others and the Sentinels still haven’t reacted, as their size prevents them from entering the mansion.</p><p>Aurora draws X-23 in close, slowing down on purpose, because as Aurora carries no weapons, X-23 senses no danger. But at twice the speed of sound, weapons are irrelevant when your fingertips will pierce steel - like Aurora does to X-23. Aurora turns her attention to Cessily Kincaid a.k.a. Mercury, and as the young mutant approaches Aurora, who has been trained in combat by none other than Wolverine, Aurora uses her speed to separate Cessily’s liquid-metal body. Serafina remarks that it is all clear now, when, suddenly - ‘Jeanne-Marie. We can’t do this anymore!’ exclaims a second Aurora as she appears behind Jeanne-Marie.</p><p>‘N-no!’ cries Jeanne-Marie, while the “reflection” of herself exclaims ‘We’re falling apart. Don’t you see? We’re killing ourself. Try to remember when we were only one mind. One pair of eyes.’ The real Jeanne-Marie begins to protest, ‘I’m not -’ she begins, until the “reflection” exclaims ‘You don’t know who you are. You never did!’ She leans down to the real Jeanne-Marie and tells her that she is leaving. ‘I think I’ll manage better on my own’. Aurora snaps and pushes the other away, ‘You can’t!’ she exclaims as she begins to punch her, ordering her to get back inside, when suddenly Aurora begins to weaken as a steam begins to appear around her and eventually make her pass out.</p><p>The “reflection” Jeanne-Marie reverts to her true form of Mystique and exclaims ‘Iceman? Is that you? If so, thank you for the very timely assistance!’ Bobby exclaims that he came back - ‘Steam to ice to -’ he begins to struggle, exclaiming that he cannot breathe, and passes out, half-ice half-man. Mystique goes over to Bobby and remarks that this will certainly count as a humanitarian gesture, but that it is a pity no one is here to see it, and with that, Raven Darkholme places her lips on Bobby’s and breathes life back into him.</p><p>Back in the vaulted section of the mansion, Rogue combats Northstar using his own speed against him. But the recently-deceased former X-Man tells Rogue that she cannot damage him, for the same force that shields him from friction takes the power from her blows. Rogue replies that it cuts both ways, pointing out that every time she gets through his guard, she steals a little bit more of what is keeping him moving. Jean-Paul declares that speed-dueling isn’t just about velocity, and adds that some things you only learn through experience.</p><p>Racing down a corridor with Rogue trailing behind him, Northstar exclaims that creating wind shear is one such thing, then, turning back to Rogue, he adds that turning momentum into power is another, and smashes Rogue to the ground. Jean-Paul exclaims that this wont hurt and remarks that he doesn’t have the time right now to make it hurt. ‘But dead is dead, right -’ suddenly, Jean-Paul is struck in the head by a blast, and in enters yet another former X-Man, the warrior Nathan Summers a.k.a. Cable who declares that he is really sorry to interrupt, but that the door was open so he just knocked and walked on in. Standing over Jean-Paul’s motionless body, Cable remarks that part of Jean-Paul is screaming at himself for what he just said about Rogue, ‘So I think you’ll probably thank me for this someday.’</p><p>‘No! It’s going wrong!’ Serafina exclaims. Perro asks how is it going wrong, to which the enigmatic young woman replies that an additional variable has entered - something they did not anticipate. Perro reminds Serafina that he told her they should have done this themselves, to which Serafina replies that he should tell Sangre that, because it was Sangre’s plan to hide their full power until it was too late for the X-Men to stop them. Serafina points out that, right now, the proxies have let them down, so she is going to go in. Perro is surprised, and as Serafina begins walking towards the mansion he calls out to her that she is exceeding the brief.</p><p>Serafina replies that the brief is to deal with Sabretooth and anyone he may have spoken to. She asks Perro to tell Sangre that is what she intends to do, before assuring him that she will stay cloaked, so nothing will see or sense her unless she wants them to. Approaching the security gates, Serafina exclaims ‘Voice identification Emma Frost. Accept and log new voice sample’. The computer beeps and the gates open, allowing the powerful young woman into the Xavier Institute.</p><p>Nearby, several O*N*E* soldiers are gathered, and one of them asks if they are going to go in. Another replies that he is unsure, as it sounded like a riot in there, but now there is no sound. Up inside two of the Sentinels which are supposed to protect the X-Men, students and The 198, one of the operators mutters that this is a thrilling detail, while the other replies that if something got past them and into the house then they will see “thrilling” when Rhodes finds out. Undetected by everyone and everything, Serafina slips into the X-Men’s home through a damaged wall.</p><p>Shortly, Serafina stands in amongst the X-Men who have all gathered together - Wolverine, Cyclops, the White Queen, Rogue, Iceman, Cannonball, Colossus and Shadowcat. Aurora lies on the ground, while Cable brings in the unconscious Northstar. Upon seeing his son, Cyclops asks Cable what he is doing here. Cable replies that the short answer is that he wants to know what is going on. ’Looks pretty obvious from here, bub’ Logan remarks while Cannonball tends to Iceman. Cable replies ’Does it?’ and informs the X-Men that they may not be aware that the sun went dark for three seconds - or that most of the energy - billions of joules - was siphoned off to a site only half a mile from the Xavier Institute.</p><p>Cannonball picks Iceman up and remarks that it seems like what happened has to be connected to this attack. As Cable puts Northstar down beside Aurora, Emma points out that the Beaubier twins do not have solar-based powers, or a reason for doing this. Cable asks the X-Men if they are sure that Northstar and Aurora are the only enemies they are facing. Cannonball tells his former X-Force leader that, to be honest, they are not sure of anything. Adding that they didn’t even know Northstar was alive until five minutes ago. Carrying Iceman out of the room, Cannonball tells Cable that it is good to see him again and that he hopes he sticks around a while to help them figure this out. With that, Sam leaves the room informing everyone he is taking Bobby to the infirmary, unaware of course that Serafina is following him.</p><p>Colossus turns to Wolverine and asks him what the matter is, to which Logan replies that he isn’t sure, but that it is like he is smelling a hole in the air - something isn’t right here. Rogue exclaims that what isn’t right here is that Northstar knew about Sabretooth being here, adding that she thinks Creed might have been the main target. ’Creed is here?’ Cable asks. Rogue informs Cable that Sabretooth showed up yesterday, on the run from something but he will not say what.</p><p>Cable suggests that he might be able to help, to which Emma informs him that she has already tried to read him and failed. ’Do you even <em>have</em> your psi-powers anymore?’ Emma asks snidely. ’Yes and no,’ Cable replies, before explaining that he wasn’t planning on reading Sabretooth, just playing him. Cyclops kneels down by Northstar and Aurora and asks what they should do with them. Emma announces that the Beaubier twins’ minds are both full of broken glass, that they saw an angel, but she is quite sure that the angel was a post-production effect. ’You mean like your hair?’ Rogue asks, before informing Cable that Sabretooth is in the basement and that he can give it a shot, as she doesn’t see how much they have to lose now.</p><p>Shortly, Cable smirks at Victor “Sabretooth” Creed, telling him that it is his luck day, as he just had a narrow escape from a co-opted assassin. ‘And you’re about to have another one from me’. ‘Ya think so?’ Creed replies. Cable replies that he does, to which Creed asks why that would be. ‘Because you’re not stupid and this is a no-brainer’ Cable replies, before revealing to Creed that he knows he turned up here looking bruised and battered, and asks if his healing factor is giving him problems. Creed replies that it is fine now and asks Cable if he can cut him loose so they can spar a little.</p><p>Cable remarks that perhaps Creed needs an in-depth examination. ‘Maybe you need a shrink,’ he exclaims, pointing out that some believe your state of mind can affect your immune system. Cable puts a couple of fingers to Creed’s forehead and tells him that stress and exhaustion all takes its toll - it takes away that fine edge that makes one feel a little sick. ‘What are you trying to do to me, scar face?’ Creed asks. Cable replies ‘Nothing. Just putting ideas in your head’ Cable adds that he may not be able to read Creed’s mind, but he can write to it, planting suggestions that will slow him down or throw him off in a fight, brining him down to everyone else’s level. ‘I doubt you’d like it there’ Cable tells him.</p><p>Face-to-face, Creed goads Cable - ‘Try it, soldier-boy. Dive in. Deeper you go, harder it is to get out again!’ Cable doesn’t respond, so Sabretooth pulls back muttering that he was going to use this information to buy his way into the Xavier Institute anyway, just in case the X-chumps were feeling less noble than usual. Creed reveals that they are called the Children of the Vault. ‘They’re not mutants, but they’re not human either’ he reveals, adding that the reason they want to kill him is because he knows they exist. ‘So I guess you all just joined me on the endangered species list!’</p><p>Meanwhile, in the med-lab, the Beast stands by Bobby’s bed and tells him that evaporating then recondensing is an X-Men first, before asking him how it is done. Cannonball and Karima Shapandar stand by the bed also and Bobby replies that he doesn’t know how he did it, for although he was still conscious and still aware, he found that if he concentrated he could sort of coalesce - pull himself together again. Beast tells Bobby that they are all glad he did, before explaining that he is going to take a reading of his core-density, when Karima announces that it is eighteen percent down on normal mean values, and that salt and potassium are down by a quarter.</p><p>‘Almost suspiciously precise, Miss Shapandar’ Beast remarks, to which Karima replies that the Sentinel technology in her body makes analyzing mutant abilities a part of her core functionality. ‘Yes, of course’ Beast replies, before turning back to Iceman and prescribing bed rest and a bath of liquid hydrogen to have him feeling perky again in no time, adding that it will mean he will have to be sealed in the med-lab. ‘You’ll be fine, Bobby’ Sam remarks, to which Iceman replies that right now he feels like a slush puppy, and asking Sam to thank Mystique for him, as she kind of came through when he needed it.</p><p>Sam waves goodbye to Bobby as he and Beast leave the room in the med-lab where Bobby is sealed in, unaware that Serafina is watching them. Serafina follows Sam, then walks over to the bed where Lady Mastermind a.k.a. Regan Wyngarde is recuperating and reads her chart. ’Forgive me, Sangre. I can’t resist!’ Serafina remarks as she uses her powers to enter Lady Mastermind. Sam senses something wrong and calls out ’Hello? Somebody there?’, when suddenly, he finds himself in a strange place, dark, with photographs all around him. Serafina stands behind him and tells him that there is no point in struggling, that if he relaxes into this, his mind may even remain more or less intact. ’Now…what game shall we play first?’….</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>The X-Men discover the truth behind their mysterious new enemies! It's time to take the fight to this new and dangerous threat...but are their enemies closer than the X-Men think?</i></p><p>(In dream-sequence)</p><p>‘Company life. Company funeral. Company hymn,’ exclaims a well-dressed woman as she strides towards an equally well-dressed man sitting at his desk. The blond man turns, ‘Huh? Oh. Hi, Sarah!’ he exclaims, smiling at the dark-haired woman. Sarah apologizes and tells Sam that he looked so serious sitting there, and asks if there is anything she can help with. Sam replies that, honestly, he doesn’t know, that he is not sure what is “eating” him. He remarks that he should be happy, as he has been working towards that promotion for two years now, but he just feels that something is missing.</p><p>Sarah tells Sam that he needs to get out more. ‘Oh yeah?’ Sam asks. ‘Yeah, flex those muscles you’re not using!’ Sarah exclaims. ‘Any particular muscles you had in mind?’ Sam asks, to which Sarah jokingly tells Sam not to get sassy with her. ‘Okay, no sass. I swear, this is a sass-free zone!’ Sam exclaims, before asking if they can talk about this over dinner. ‘Dinner? Oh, you think?’ Sarah replies. Sam replies that he does, to which Sarah remarks that she thinks he likes to move fast. Sam asks if that bothers her, to which Sarah replies “Not in the slightest”.</p><p>(Reality)</p><p>Sam “Cannonball” Guthrie lies sprawled on the Xavier Institute’s infirmary floor, with the deadly and powerful Serafina standing over him, hooked up to the unconscious Regan Wyngarde a.k.a. Lady Mastermind.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the basement of the Xavier Institute, the savage Victor “Sabretooth” Creed asks his fellow mutants surrounding him if they are sure they want to hear the whole thing – as it gets pretty nasty. Rogue tells Creed not to waste their time, and that if he wants sanctuary with the X-Men then he has to tell them what this is all about, otherwise they will hang him outside for the crows to peck at. ‘Sure Rogue, sure. Any chance of a beer to lube my throat a little?’ Creed asks. Rogue just glares back at Creed, as does Scott “Cyclops” Summers and his son from an alternate future Nathan Dayspring Summers a.k.a. Cable. Creed jokes that they can save the beer for later and that they can toss another log on the fire as “Grandpa Victor” will tell them a story….</p><p>(Shown with flashback images)</p><p>‘I was in Peru. And I was killing this guy’. Creed begins. Cable asks Creed what “guy” he is talking about, and who was paying him, whether he was working alone or now. ‘Give us some context!’ Cable exclaims. ‘Well pardon me, Cable. I forgot about “Once upon a time”!’ Creed snaps back, before revealing that he had a tail-gunner on this one, a real nut job by the name of Pasco, who had a mutant power, a force field, ‘Mostly he just carried my stuff’.</p><p>Creed reveals that they had a shopping list of about two dozen names and one real big commission, but it was a double-blind deal so he had no idea who wanted these guys whacked. Although it was easy money, Creed thought that it was a little dull, a most of the people he was murdering turned out to be scientists, not to mention senior citizens, so they didn’t exactly make a fight of it. Except for the last on, Casales, who turned out to be interesting. Bleeding to death, Casales pleaded with Creed ‘Please…let me tell you…let me tell you…’.</p><p>Turns out, Casales was the one that hired Creed and Pasco, and he wanted to die as he was on some kind of guilt trip, he and all the other scientists did something awful a long time ago and it kept preying on their mind. But staring death in the face, Casales didn’t like that, and he tried to bargain with Creed, going on about something incredible, something unique, sealed inside a vault. ‘He says it’s the most precious thing in the whole damn world’.</p><p>Creed and Pasco still killed Casales, and took a look at his files to find out what he was talking about. This “vault” was a ship named the Conquistador, a ULCC-type tanker with a Panamanian registry. It piqued Creed’s curiosity – half a million tons dead weight, and a hull beefed up to about eight feet thick. Creed regrets that he didn’t leave Casales to bleed out a little, as he could have got some more information from him.</p><p>(Present)</p><p>‘What? That come across as cold? I keep forgetting how delicate you people are…how easy it is to get under your skin!’</p><p>(In dream-sequence)</p><p>Sam and Sarah date, have fun together, have their first kiss, get married, and have two children….’What – what is this?’ Sam exclaims one day to Sarah at the dinner table, their infant children with them. Sarah asks Sam what he means, ‘Aren’t you happy?’ she asks. Sam tells Sarah that she knows he loves her, but there seem to be holes in his head – things he ought to remember but cannot seem to focus in on them, and he is beginning to wonder if there is something wrong with him. Sarah scowls.</p><p>Later, at a hospital, the doctor holds up the scans of Sam’s brain and informs Sam and Sarah that they are perfectly normal, and assures him that he can come see him any time. Leaving the hospital, Sarah tells Sam that he will live until he is ninety. ‘Yeah, I guess’ Sam mutters in reply, before asking where the kids are. ‘The kids? Oh, I wrote them out. You’ll forget about them in a second. I liked it better when it was just the two of us!’</p><p>(Reality)</p><p>Outside the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, a deranged old man approaches the gates, his eyes black, several teeth missing from his mouth, and wearing dirty, tattered clothing. He puts his hands up to the gate, so one of the O*N*E* soldiers asks him if he wants to move along. ‘Quiet! Quiet!...are you even there, my pretty one?’ the old man exclaims. The second solider informs the old man that this is private property under the jurisdiction of the Office of National Emergency.</p><p>‘Yes, yes. I’m here! I saw you from so far away and I came to find you!’ the old man declares, ignoring the soldiers, then keeling over to the ground. The two soldier’s stand over him. ‘I didn’t even touch him, Callister! You saw me not touch him’. Callister replies ‘Yeah, I saw’ and tells Donnie not to worry about it, ‘From the state he’s in and the smell – I’m surprised he made it this far!’</p><p>Back in the basement, Sabretooth reveals that after finding out about that ship, he couldn’t get it out of his head, he wanted to know what was on it.</p><p>(Shown with flashback images)</p><p>Creed and Pasco “borrowed” themselves a speed boat and headed out from Callao, and although it was a hell of a trip, the previous owner of the small boat was a drug runner, so the speed boat was fast. They found the Conquistador, exactly where Casale’s files said it would be – where the ship had been for the past thirty years with no crew and an unlisted cargo. The Conquistador was out in international waters, where no one would like twice at her and no one would have the authority to inspect her either.</p><p>Creed asks the X-Men and Cable if he mentioned what day it was that he and Pasco boarded the Conquistador. ‘It was November 2nd – maybe that rings some bells with you’. After boarding, Creed and Pasco began pulling hatches open, banging on walls, trying any thing they could to find a way into the ship.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a flash, like someone took a photo, and Pasco gives a yell. Creed thought Pasco might have found something, but instead he just cut up his knuckles banging on the door. Creed was going to tell him to stop snivelling, when he realized what that meant. ‘November 2nd, 3.00pm in the afternoon, and Pasco had just joined the biggest club in the world. <i>Homo Sapiens</i>’.</p><p>The deck began to hum under their feet, and big, powerful engines somewhere came to life. The sky went a funny read color, and it was around then that Sabretooth realized that, perhaps he and Pasco had worn out their welcome. Several begins emerge from panel on the ship and hover above Creed and Pasco. One of them spoke, and for once, Creed’s gutter Spanish came in handy for something besides ordering beer.</p><p>The mysterious super begins begin attacking Creed and Pasco, so Creed attacked back, gutting the skinny one that spoke, but it was pretty clear that Sabretooth was wasting his time. ‘You know how we’re supposed to be 98% water? Well, he was a couple of shots over the limit!’</p><p>The next thing Creed knew, the world’s the wrong way up and he is falling side-ways towards a big wall of a guy who is smiling like it is Christmas. The big muscular guy hit Creed harder than he had ever been hit in his life, breaking his jaw, neck and even part of his shoulder. What saved Creed from them, was Pasco, who they set on fire. As Pasco no longer had his force field, he was carrying all of their indecencies, and as everything goes up in flames, Creed manages to dive off the ship and into the water.</p><p>(Present)</p><p>‘And that’s all she wrote. Motherless sons ’ve been on my back ever since’ Creed concludes, explaining that every time he thought he lost them – Bolivia, Mexico, Arizona – they keep popping up again and trying to gut him. Creed reveals that one time he went to ground and they walked right by him, close enough that he could hear them talking, and announces that they call themselves something that translates to “The Children of the Vault”.</p><p>‘November 2nd’ Cable remarks. ‘M-Day!’ Rogue exclaims. ‘Sure, why do you think Pasco lost his ring of confidence?’ Creed remarks. Cable leans towards Creed and exclaims ‘A million mutants lost their powers and you keep yours. What was God thinking?!’ Creed tells Cable to look around him, ‘You see how the world works? If there’s a God, he looks like me!’ Cable tells Rogue and Cyclops that they need to check this out, and they need to do it now. ‘The longer we leave this, the worse it’s going to get!’</p><p>(In dream-sequence)</p><p>Sam sits alone on a couch, pensive; his thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of Sarah who asks him if he is okay. Sam replies that, if he had to guess, then he would say that no, he is not okay. Sarah asks him what the matter is, to which Sam replies ‘Everything is the matter! Our whole life, it doesn’t hold together!’ He asks Sarah where he met her, as sometimes he remembers it one way, and sometimes another way, before mentioning that he has this vivid picture in his head of her being seven months pregnant.</p><p>Sarah exclaims that they are hallucinations, but Sam declares ‘<i>No</i>, Sarah!’ before asking her if she is somehow hypnotizing him. ‘Of course not!’ Sarah claims, to which Sam asks if he is schizophrenic or delusional, lying in a hospital somewhere drooling down his chin? “Sarah” tells Sam that he shouldn’t be able to think around her blocks, although Regan Wyngarde’s powers are new to her, so she tries to adjust the interface a little….</p><p>(Reality)</p><p>‘Oh…’ Serafina exclaims. ‘These yours?’ Logan a.k.a. Wolverine asks her, holding up the wires that connected her to Lady Mastermind. Claws bared, Logan remarks that, to be honest, he is relieved Serafina exists, as he was beginning to think he was going crazy, like there was a dead zone all around Serafina, a moving blind spot. ‘”Going crazy”? I know all about you, Wolverine. I believe that would have been a very short trip!’ Serafina replies as she tosses some devices at the powerful X-Man.</p><p>Wolverine tells Serafina that it is obvious she doesn’t play well with others, and remarks that it is okay, because neither does he. He slices the devices that Serafina tossed at him, except one lands on one of his claws, causes them to grow, and forces Wolverine to the floor. Serafina informs Wolverine that adamantium has thirteen allotropic forms, unstable and short-lived, but virtually poisonous. ‘This is a brief taste of adamantium nine’.</p><p>Cannonball sits up, ‘Sarah! Don’t! Please don’t!’ he exclaims. Serafina introduces herself not as “Sarah” and tells Sam that she lied about her name, and species, before kicking him in the face and revealing that the Vault reproduction is asexual, but she wanted to try the other kind, admitting that she is weak and should have resisted, but asks when else she could have done it without actually touching him? Serafina tells Sam that she enjoyed their time together – all four minutes of it – and assures him that she will remember him when all of his kind is gone. With that, she vanishes. Sam and Logan gather themselves, and Logan asks Cannonball if he has been consorting with the enemy.</p><p>Cyclops, Rogue and Cable are joined by Emma “the White Queen” Frost, and Raven Darkholme a.k.a. Mystique. Cable informs them that this hologram projector will let them see what he sees, and since he lost his telepathic powers, he finds the global Info-Net a useful substitute. Cable announces that all of Creed’s targets were biologists, most of whom were researching global warming and eco-catastrophe, all except for Bella Pagan, who was a temporal physicist.</p><p>Cable reveals that Bella Pagan and the others began working together in 1970 and gave a demonstration of temporal acceleration, which is denounced as fraudulent. He adds that they also share a paper on parallel evolution which is ignored. Cable explains that the speed of evolution is set by the intergenerational gap to make evolution run faster – all that is needed is to bring more generations to maturity in a given time frame, and two years later they persuade the Chilean government to lease them the Conquistador, the scientists re-fit it and abscond – and the chaos surrounding the 1973 coup conveniently destroys most of the records.</p><p>Rogue asks Cable if he thinks the scientists succeeded in building an accelerator, then turned the Conquistador into some kind of time machine. Cable explains that the accelerator would not have let them travel through time, as it would be a sealed space, within which time moved more quickly by a factor of several hundred times. Cable remarks that in the three decades the Conquistador was at sea – assuming it was inhabited – the people inside it would have lived through six thousand years.</p><p>Emma asks Nathan if he is saying that the children are mutants, to which Cable explains that they aren’t, they are fully human, but that after so many centuries of genetic drift, they have to count as a separate species, and the technologies they have developed are as formidable and dangerous as any super power. ‘Yeah. You got that right!’ exclaims Wolverine as he helps Cannonball along, and joins the conference.</p><p>Rogue asks Sam what happened to him, to which Sam replies ‘I got married – it’s a long story!’ Scott asks Sam if he is okay, to which Sam replies ‘Not hardly’, and Wolverine explains that he was bushwhacked. Logan informs everyone that they had an intruder in the house and it fits the profile Cable is describing, as the intruder spliced herself into Lady Mastermind’s nervous system and did things with those illusion powers that Regan Wyngarde couldn’t do on her best day alive.</p><p>Cable declares that they do not have much choice, to which Mystique asks why they don’t just throw Sabretooth at these other species and apologize for the misunderstanding. Cable points out that it is not just Sabretooth that they want, reminding the X-Men that the Beaubier twins were unleashed on them and opened a black hole in the middle of Nogales, just to hide their very existence – not to mention they can draw enough energy out of the sun to make the sky turn dark at Noon. ‘So I think we need to know why exactly they’re so shy!’</p><p>Rogue agrees and suggests they go and ask them, to which Emma asks her if she thinks they will stay put and wait for her to come. Rogue points out that they are on an oil tanker, a big old ship that weighs half a million tons – ‘They’re not going anywhere!’</p><p>‘Serafina! We are not well pleased with you!’ exclaims Sangre. Perro and Fuego are also present, as Serafina exclaims that she is sorry, claiming she was led astray by her enthusiasm and admitting that she thought she could succeed where their puppets failed, but she was wrong. Sangre asks her if the X-Men saw her before she could kill Creed, to which Serafina replies they did, and since she was uncertain whether she could kill them all, she withdrew. ‘Hah! Wonderful!’ Perro exclaims sarcastically, remarking that one error leads to another, and having failed to kill Creed they have now announced themselves to the X-Men. ‘This is a farce!’</p><p>Sangre remarks that it does not matter, as it was inevitable really that they would clash with what is left of Homo Superior. He adds that the time for hiding is past, despite all of their efforts. The Conquistador floats in the air, high above the ocean, and as the sky reddens, Sangre announces that at the very least, this will serve as a dress rehearsal…for the greater carnage that is to come!</p>",

(a subsidiary of the Beyond Corporation©) put NEXTWAVE together to fight Bizarre Weapons of Mass Destruction. When NEXTWAVE discovers that H.A.T.E. and Beyond© are terrorist cells themselves and that the BWMDs were intended to kill them, they are less than pleased. In fact, they are rather angry. So they make things explode. Lots of things. Starring Monica Rambeau (formerly Captain Marvel and Photon), Aaron Stack (Machine Man), Tabitha Smith (X-Force’s Meltdown), monster-hunter Elsa Bloodstone and The Captain! Guest-starring Fin Fang Foom!!! If you like anything, you will LOVE NEXTWAVE!!! BOOM!!</em></p>",

Meanwhile, the feral hero Dingo is on the hunt for a fellow kindred, but there are others in these woods also hunting for Kindred, and Dingo just made their list. Plus, Backlash helps Quentin test the limits of his powers. This issue includes six handbook style dossiers including Backlash, Taboo, Crimson, Aries, Dingo, and Omni.

Air Force bombs and missiles are useless against it, so how can the B.P.R.D., on the verge of total collapse, hope to stop it? The answer lies in a dream and in the bottom of a dresser drawer of a man who never existed.</i></p><p>Number 22 in the B.P.R.D. series.</p><p>Katha Hem has been summoned by the frogmen and The Black Flame. It's leaving a trail of destruction across the United States.</p><p>The Black Flame, taken hostage by the frogmen, is used as a beacon to lead it while the Army is using various weaponry to destroy it, unsuccessfully.</p><p>Director Manning is refusing Ben Daimio's resignation at the B.P.R.D., while Liz Sherman is having another vision, helped by the mystic powers of Johann Kraus, leading her to a mysterious artefact in Roger's room.</p>",

Curtis Carr, High-Tech, then uses his Neural Overload Net to capture Mr. Lawson and escape.</p><p>The scene changes to Deathlok. He is in the cybernet. We find out that he has gotten a job as a freelance computer consulter. To help his roommate, Jesus, pay for bills. He is fixing a computer, while writing a letter to Tracy, his wife, when we arrive. Computer informs Deathlok that an old Cybertek file was opened. Deathlok tells computer he is busy and to get information to tell him later.</p><p>The scene turns to Rock Hill, South Carolina at the Coporate Headquarters of Magnum Munitions. Mr. Lawson is being chewed out about the break-in by Moses Magnum. Mr. Magnum gives Mr. Lawson one last chance to redeem himself by retrieving the stolen data.</p><p>The scene changes to Stark Prosthetics in Denver, Colorado and Curtis Car who has just returned. He plugs the stolen data into his computer and quickly rips it out because the data is being traced.</p><p>The scene changes back to Magnum Munitions. Mr. Lawson is informed that they have traced the stolen data's signal. Mr. Lawson tells an employee to get the Terrordome ready. Mr. Lawson is going to go retrieve the data and kill Curtis.</p><p>The scene changes back to Curtis who has put his High-Tech suit back on and says he knows that they are coming and he will be ready for them with a big surprise.</p><p>The scene changes back to Deathlok in the cybernet. Computer informs Deathlok of the trace. Jesus starts banging on Deathlok's head to get him out of cybernet. Jesus asks Deathlok to help him carry some heavy items but Deathlok says he will later but now he has to go to Denver.</p><p>The scene changes to Jesus and Deathlok walking to the airport and Deathlok is informing Jesus why he has ot leave. Jesus asks if going on a plane is such a good idea. Deathlok asks why and the scene changes to Deathlok flying in a plane to Denver. The man in the seat next to him terrified. He asks the attendant for coffee to give to the man and in the process scares her.</p><p>The scene changes and Deathlok is breaking into Stark Prosthetics. He is about to open the door to Curtis's office when it is blow apart and Deathlok with it. Deathlok and High-Tech fight until Deathlok overpowers him and says he just wants to talk. High-Tech says he's sorry he thougt that Magnum had sent Deathlok after him. Curtis explains he stole the information so that he could help improve his research to make prosthetic limbs. Deathlok sympathizes with him and tells him his story. Whle waiting for Terrordome to arrive Deathlok helps with the prosthetic work. Terrordome arrives and Deathlok and Terrordome battle until Deathlok destoys it. Deathlok puts Mr. Lawson in Curtis's care until the police arrive. Curtis says he will turn himself in and also offers Deathlok a job at Stark Prosthetics.Deathlok refuses the offer and returns home.</p><p>There are two quick panels where Deathlok is on a plane and continuing his letter to Tracy. In the letter we find out that Moses Magnum in order to drive off suspision from himself about the Terrordome incident denies that Curtis stole any information and therefore Curtis was released.</p><p>Epilogue: We are back at Magnum Munitions Headquarters.

    "description": "<p><em>Firestorm tests his powers dealing with two loan sharks shaking down an old man on a busy Manhattan sidewalk. Ronnie tries to impress a random girl to prove a point to Professor Stein but it doesn't go as planned. Professor Stein is left disoriented at the Hudson Nuclear Plant after transforming back from Firestorm. Danton Black accosts the Professor as he is being questioned by police that responded for the Plant explosion. Ronnie has a dispute with Cliff Carmichael. Clark Kent broadcasts a news report about Firestorm. Multiplex, the Multiple Menace, appears and wreaks havoc. </em></p><p><ins><strong>Firestorm826's Panel-by-Panel Story Summary (Spoiler Alert)</strong></ins></p><p>Scene: The much-maligned isle of Manhattan! Dramatic personae: Two gangsters, an old codger, and the Nuclear Man. Time: When else? Right now! </p><p>“Just what I’ve been looking for - - a chance to give my powers a little workout!” Ronnie thinks as he happens across a street mugging-in-progress, “Besides, I’ve got time to kill…School doesn’t start for an hour!” </p><p>On the sidewalk just ahead, two thugs are working over a defenseless man. One holds him tightly with his arms behind his back while the other pummels his stomach with punches. “Youse is three days late wit yer loan payments, Mortie,” one says between punches, “Mister Oswald don’t like it when stiffs welch on him.” Mortie stares back, wide-eyed and scared. “Please, gimmie anudder day!” he begs, “Tomorrow’s my payday - - honest!” The thug rears back, readying another punch. “Sorry, Mortie,” he scoffs, “The Mob don’t like welchers…”</p><p>Suddenly, Firestorm appears overhead! “And I don’t like the Mob!” Ronnie yells down. “Say what?” the thug cries out, asking, “Who da heck…?” Firestorm scowls at him, aiming a nuclear fingertip at him. “Call me Firestorm, you creep - - as in the Nuclear Man!” Ronnie glowers as atomic energy flows from his hand.</p><p>ZAAZZK! A gesture, and instantly, a beam of sheer energy lances white-hot to the pavement below - - where the atomic structure of the concrete is suddenly altered - - turning cold cement into gloppy hot tar! </p><p>The two thugs find themselves suddenly immobilized in the sticky goo as two NYPD officers arrive. “Uh…Geewhiz…Dat guy saved my life!” Mortie cries in relief as Firestorm leaps skyward. “No applause, please,” he calls out with a playful grin, thinking, “I wish Doreen could see me pull stunts like that! Man, would she be knocked out!” Down below, a confused onlooker wonders, “Gosh…I wonder how he makes his hair burn like that? Sure must hurt like hell!” </p><p>Stein tries to bring Ronnie back to reality. “Actually, Ronald, I rather doubt that most women - - your Doreen included - - are all that impressed by feats of physical prowess,” he suggests. Ronnie soars over the busy streets as curious onlookers point at him and wonder. “That shows what you know, Professor,” Ronnie replies, “You may be terrific with test tubes, but when it comes to girls, you know zip!” Stein sighs at the exuberance of youth. “Ronald,” he answers, “I am older than you, after all, I’ve had experience…” </p><p>Ronnie quickly comes to a landing near two young couples walking along on the sidewalk. “Nuts! I’ll prove I’m right!” he thinks, “There’s a foxy lady right now!” The two couples look on in amazement as the Nuclear Man walks up to them. “Wow! You’re Firestorm, aren’t you?” one young man asks. “Yep,” Ronnie nods. “I saw a news report about you on TV last night!” the young man continues, “Say, Cynthia, this is the fella who captured those bombers at the atomic plant!” Cynthia looks at Firestorm nervously. “His h-hair…it’s burning…” she sputters. </p><p>Ronnie scoops up a discarded newspaper in his hand. “Just an illusion, Cynthia,” he tells her nonchalantly, “But if you want to see something that’s not a trick…watch this!” FOOF! Instantly, Ronnie rearranges the newspaper into a bouquet of roses! “You didn’t - - you couldn’t - - this can’t be happening - - I think I’m going to…Oooooohhh…” Cynthia stammers woozily and then faints! Her friends scramble to catch her. “She’s fainted - - and her friends look most displeased!” Stein warns, advising, “An exit is indicated, Ronald.” Ronnie steps back a bit defensively. “You’re right!” he gulps. “What’d you do to my girl, you freak?” Cynthia’s boyfriend yells. </p><p>In a quick nuclear flash, Ronnie leaps skyward. “Oh, rats!” Ronnie groans. “I knew I shouldn’t have become Firestorm again, but I just had to try it one more time, after the fun I had last night - - but it looks like I can’t even be a super-hero without messing up my chances with girls!” </p><p>Stein tries to reassure him. “You’re much too hard on yourself, Ronald,” he suggests, asking, “We saved that old man’s life, didn’t we?” Ronnie is still worried. “Yeah, but wat that my half of our persona working - - or was that you, Professor?” he asks. “You forget, Ronald,” Stein reminds him, “Because Martin Stein was unconscious when we first became Firestorm, my persona is in a dormant mode. You, Ronald, are in charge of our body - - always!” </p><p>Firestorm is silent now, thoughtful as he returns to the site of the Hudson Nuclear Power Plant in southern Westchester, where Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein were first joined…Concentrating, Firestorm now severs that link once more - - and the two halves of the Nuclear Man become separate beings, each with his own dreams! </p><p>Firefighters and police work the scene around the Hudson Nuclear Plant. Professor Stein staggers off towards the first responders, disoriented and confused from the transformation. “The Professor’s dazed - - just like he was when we last split up!” Ronnie thinks, “He never remembers what happens to us when we’re Firestorm, and maybe that’s good. One thing I don’t need is someone bossing me around…I like the Professor…even though he’s a lot like Cliff Carmichael. They’re both geniuses…but at least Professor Stein doesn’t show off…” </p><p>Ronnie thinks back to his first meeting with his arch-rival. “It’s Carmichael’s fault all this happened to me, I guess,” Ronnie recalls, “If he hadn’t made me feel like a dumb jock in front of Doreen Day, maybe I wouldn’t have tried to prove myself to her…After all, that’s why I joined Eddie Earhart’s Coalition to Resist Atomic Power - - to show Doreen I wasn’t as stupid as Carmichael said! But it turned out I was stupid - - because Earhart’s idea of resisting atomic power was blowing nuclear plants sky-high, and using me as a patsy to take the blame! The plant he chose was one designed and built by Professor Stein - - that’s why Stein and I were together!” </p><p>Ronnie walks along, slowly making his way to Bradley High. “Why we didn’t die during the explosion, I’ll never know - - but we didn’t - - we became Firestorm!” he remembers, “Now we can fly, alter our own atomic structure, even alter things around us! Last night, after we stopped Earhart’s group before it could blow up another plant, I wondered if I’d ever become Firestorm again…When I woke up this morning, I knew I had to…so I came up here, found Professor Stein, and did my thing…though I don’t know how! So that answers one question…Firestorm lives. Now I want to know - - how about Ronnie Raymond?” </p><p>And, as the frustrated teenager boards an elevated train bound for New York, back at the Hudson Plant, a bewildered Martin Stein listens to an angry cop… </p><p>“…so when the Fire Department arrives to put out this little blaze, Stein, you’re gone - - and now you show up - - without any idea where you’ve been - - or why?” the officer says suspiciously, asking, “Are you crazy - - or am I?” Stein rubs his forehead wearily. “I’m sorry, Officer, but I just don’t know what happened,” he answers, “I remember those hoodlums breaking into the plant, striking me - - and I remember waking here next morning…” </p><p>Danton Black stumbles up, clothes tattered, looking angry and disheveled. A news reporter films the breaking scene. “Liar!” Black yells out, pointing at Stein. “Eh? Black!” Stein blurts, “How did you get in here? What happened to you - - you’re a mess!” Black walks up to confront him. “Unimportant! Tell them the truth, Stein!” he growls, “I’m suing you because you stole my plans for this reactor - - and so you tried to destroy the plant to conceal your theft!” Stein quickly grows furious. “Black, you’re a fraud!” he barks back angrily. “You’ll regret that, Stein,” Black warns, shaking his fist, “Danton Black has an excellent memory for those who cross him!” </p><p>He turns and staggers away. “Particularly since you fired me as your assistant!” Black thinks, “That’s why I’m going to crucify you in court! That’s why I came here last night, to copy your designs - - to ‘prove’ my case against…” His thoughts trail off abruptly and he doubles over, clutching at his temples. “Aaaarrggghh,” he groans, “Splitting headache…!” He looks up dizzily, his vision blurred. “My head’s been in agony since that explosion last night - - pain cutting right through my skull, tearing it in two!” he moans, “My God, I’m even seeing double! Have to get away! Can’t let Stein see me like this! Lord - - what’s happening to me?” </p><p>More on Danton Black later; right now, let’s look ahead several hours to the end of the school day, as… </p><p>“This Firestorm character sure is something else!” Doreen says with a smile. She holds a newspaper with prominent headlines announcing the arrival of Firestorm in New York. “You like him, Doreen?” Ronnie asks knowingly. “Sure,” she sighs. Cliff Carmichael overhears their discussion. “You ask me, the man’s obviously a mental midget,” he scoffs, “He’s as hung up on violence as you are, Raymond!” Ronnie glares furiously at Cliff, rearing back his fist. “Nobody asked you, Carmichael,” Ronnie snarls, “And speaking of violence, that reminds me - - I still haven’t thanked you for your wisecracks at lunch yesterday!” </p><p>Cliff feigns fear at Ronnie. “Oh goodness! King Kong’s on the rampage again!” he teases, adding, “Please don’t get physical, Mr. Raymond. Principal Hapgood might not approve!” Ronnie reconsiders. “Aw, what’s the use? Everything I do is a botch,” he grumbles as he walks away, “I can’t even paste a guy without my girl getting mad.” Cliff looks over at Doreen, pointing his thumb at Ronnie. “Your girl? Ha!” he snorts. “Clifford…Dry up!” Doreen scolds him. </p><p>Soon after, at the Raymond home…Ronnie and his Dad sit in the living room together watching the evening news blaring from the TV. “…where he intercepted two Mob muscle-men in the act of harassing a victim of well-known loan shark, Oscar Oswald. We’ll be back with film on New York’s new super-hero after these messages,” the newscaster explains. </p><p>“First time Dad’s been home for supper in a week,” Ronnie thinks, “I know he’s been busy getting adjusted to his new job on the newspaper…but I wish he’d spend more time around the house…” His thoughts trail off and he thinks of the news coverage. “Say, Dad…how about this Firestorm guy, huh? Neat, right?” he asks. “I don’t approve of costumed vigilantes, Ronald,” his Dad replies, pointing at the screen, “Having Wonder Woman in New York is bad enough - - but now, with this self-styled ‘crimefighter’ - - well, frankly, there should be a law.” Ronnie sighs and grabs his jacket. “Look, I’m gonna go out for a walk, okay?” Ronnie asks. “Eh? Of course, Ronald. Do what you want,” his Dad replies. </p><p>Ronnie walks out into the moonlit driveway to shoot some free throws while he thinks. “Terrific. Even my Dad disapproves of Firestorm,” he worries, “What’s wrong with me? I do something right - - just for a change - - I just want them to be proud of me…I just want them to be proud…”</p><p> Meanwhile, in another city a few miles south… “And that’s the news tonight, from WGBS-TV in Metropolis, this is Clark Kent, hoping your news is good news. Goodnight,” Clark smiles at the camera. A graphic of Firestorm with the caption, ‘New Hero?’ is on the screen behind him. Clark gets up from the anchor desk and makes his way out of the news studio. “That special report from New York, about that strange new super-hero…Possibly it’s none of my business, but I like to keep on top of these things,” he thinks as he finds his way to an isolated supply closet. “Naturally, that isn’t a job for a TV news anchorman…” he decides. Moments later, Superman appears flying swiftly above Metropolis! “What it is,” he says with a smile, “is a job for…Superman!” </p><p>And, as the Action Ace cuts through the twilight sky toward the murky environs of New York - - in the Hudson Nuclear Power Plant, a grim Martin Stein goes about the work of repairing equipment damaged in the previous evening’s explosion… </p><p>“Another delay in opening the plant!” he frets. He busies himself using robotic arms inside an isolated chamber to move radioactive materials. “If I were given to paranoia, I’d suspect a conspiracy!” he worries, “I designed this structure to be totally fail-safe…and completely automated, needing only one pair of human hands to operate its main controls…Yet despite all my efforts, I still don’t have permission to bring this plant on line.” </p><p>He watches as the robot hands lift and pivot with a metal beam in their grip. “Danton Black’s court order prohibits me from activating the plant until his accusations have been answered before a judge - - and now the Governor is worried because he believes the plant might have been seriously harmed by yesterday’s bombing!” He grows frustrated. “Idiots, all of them! I….eh?” A clumping noise thumps out from nearby, interrupting his thoughts. Stein calls out anxiously, “Is someone there?” </p><p>A voice answers ominously. “In a word, dear Professor,” it snarls, “Yes!” THROMP! Stein is hit on the back of the head and falls to the floor! He turns and is stunned by what stands before him! “I – I must be seeing double!” he stutters, “Wh-Who are you? What do you want?” he asks the two identical men in front of him. “You can call us Multiplex, Stein! Multiplex - - the Multiple Menace!” Multiplex says doubly, “And as for what we want here - - what does anyone want from a nuclear power plant? Hahahahahaha!” </p><p>Simultaneously, one borough away… Ronnie gets back up off the ground after inexplicably being knocked over! “Wow! My jaw’s throbbing like someone just belted me - - but not me!” he exclaims, realizing, “Someone hit Professor Stein - - and I felt it! We must be tied together, even when we’re not Firestorm - - but who cares about that!” Ronnie gets up and starts running. “If someone’s hitting the Professor, he needs help!” he blurts, “And he’s just about the only friend I have!” </p><p>Ronnie’s Dad walks out to talk to his son and sees him sprinting down the driveway. “Ronnie, I’d like to - - Ronnie?” he calls out, “Son, where are you going? Ronnie? Ronnie?” Ed Raymond is puzzled. “He doesn’t hear me? Or - - did he hear me and decide not to listen,” he wonders, “What’s wrong with that boy? Sometimes I feel as though…I don’t even know him…” </p><p>Seconds later, at a subway station downtown… “Heard Dad calling me, but this is more important!” Ronnie thinks as he runs to the train platform, “I’ve got to get to Westchester - - fast! Blast! No train in sight!” He runs down around the edge of the stairway, trying to find a secluded spot out of sight. “I can’t just stand here! The Prof needs me!” he frets nervously, “Gotta try something…Don’t know if it’ll work, but if it does, I don’t want anyone to see me…If I can feel the Professor being hit even when we’re miles apart - - maybe we don’t need to be together to fuse into Firestorm!” </p><p>Ronnie closes his eyes tightly, trying to focus his mind. “I’ll concentrate - - force myself - - remember what it was like - - the joining, the changing,” he thinks desperately, “Try! I have to try! Have to - - WAH-HOO!” he cheers as atomic rings appear and quickly transform him. A bystander on the platform looks around at the empty area where a cheer just sang out. “Wah-hoo?” he thinks curiously.</p><p> Suddenly, it happens: Across a distance of twelve miles, two bodies fuse together - - and where Martin Stein crouched in consternation - - Firestorm now stands in a blaze of ruby-gold light!</p><p> “Unwelcome company, Professor?” Ronnie asks, quickly surveying the duplicate Multiplexes. “Yes, Ronald,” Stein answers with relief. “They seem to be two parts of the same man,” he explains, “and apparently they want to steal nuclear material from the pile!”</p><p> One Multiplex works an airlock valve wheel. “Stein’s vanished - - but someone else’s joined the party!” the other Multiplex blurts as he turns to face Firestorm. “Forget him! Help me with this airtight door!” calls out the Multiplex at the valve. “Cocky pair, aren’t they?” Ronnie thinks.</p><p> The airtight door opens, and the twin Multiplexes scramble inside. “Exposure to intense radiation gave us our powers - - and according to our calculations, continued and increased exposure will add to our strength - - making us stronger than any man alive!” Multiplex schemes.</p><p> Ronnie runs after them. “Okay, that does it. I’m gonna knock heads together,” he thinks, clenching his teeth as he watches Multiplex. “Don’t be impetuous, Ronald!” Stein cautions, “There’ll be time enough for the attack - - for now, observe and learn!” Ronnie looks at Multiplex through the airlock window. “Observe what? Two guys drinking up atomic energy like it’s Coca-Cola?” Ronnie argues, “Forget it, Professor! You can stand around gawking if you want - - Me, I’m for action!” Ronnie lowers his atomic density and passes into the airlock. “Ronald, wait! Their powers are unknown!” Stein warns, “You may be heading into…”</p><p> KAWHAMO! The twin Multiplexes punch into Firestorm with incredible force! “Unnnhhh…that smarts! A guy walks through walls, he begins to think he can handle anything! But I’m in this mess up to my elbows now,” Ronnie thinks, asking Stein, “So help, huh?” </p><p>Multiplex rushes him. “I just realized you must be one of Stein’s friends,” he says, “That’s why you’re here isn’t it? To protect Martin Stein?” POWWW! He pummels Firestorm again. “That makes you more than an annoyance - - it makes you our enemy!” he yells as he strikes again, bellowing, “DIE!” </p><p>Ronnie stumbles back, rubbing his chin. “I don’t believe you said that! Talk about melodrama!” Ronnie replies, “I’ve read less corny dialogue in a comic book! You guys want a fight, fine! But give me a break, willya?”</p><p> CHAROOM! Ronnie thrusts himself forward, wrapping an arm tightly around each Multiplex as he slams into them. Their momentum carries them across the room, smashing through a concrete wall! “Excellent strategy, Ronald!” Stein exclaims, “The fail-safe mechanism will seal the plant before it leaks radiation - - but now you have room to maneuver!” </p><p>So he would have, but for one crucial consideration: The men named Multiplex are more than just a team - - they act with a precision that defies understanding - - and when they strike, it is simultaneously, with a strength that is each of their strengths squared! THOOOM! The identical Multiplexes strike with a synchronized punch! The blow is devastating - - and as far as Firestorm’s ego is concerned, humiliatingly ill-timed! </p><p>The impact from Multiplex’s double strike blasts Ronnie through the plant wall and out into the air. High above, Superman has arrived on the scene. “If that’s the Nuclear Man, he looks like he needs assistance more than he can give it!” Superman thinks. He banks down as the twin Multiplexes leap out of the hole in pursuit of Firestorm. “I’d hoped we might have a new member for the Justice League,” Superman worries, “but now - - I’m just not so sure!”</p><p> Now they descend, each half of Multiplex teleporting into the one beneath to slow their fall, repeating the process tirelessly - - until, as they near their goal…Ronnie staggers to his feet after coming down into the street outside the plant. “I can repair my injuries on the atomic level - - but I’m too shaken to do it without time to concentrate!” he groans, looking up at the rapidly descending Multiple Menace. “These creeps won’t give me the chance - - unless I get them first!” </p><p>Multiplex lands in front of Firestorm. “Now, boy, we’ll learn your connection with Martin Stein!” he sneers, “Why you arrived just after he disappeared! Choose silence over cooperation, and I swear, you’ll regret - - eh? Gesturing! And these objects are coming alive!” Multiplex is suddenly caught by surprise. Ronnie uses atomic restructuring to form two giant nutcrackers that reach out and snatch the two duplicates!</p><p> “Not alive, turkeys! Just mobile under my atomic touch!” Ronnie explains, “A glance at those objects lets me ‘read’ their molecular structure - - and then rearranging that structure is as easy as tying shoelaces!” Multiplex squirms in the tight grip of the giant nutcrackers. “Think you’re smart, eh, punk?” he snorts. “No more than the average atomic-powered hero!” Ronnie answers. “You’re a million laughs, kid!” Multiplex retorts, “But if you want a real chuckle - - try this one on for size!”</p><p> Multiplex swings his fist, smashing into a nearby fire hydrant. SPOOSH! It ruptures, and the powerful stream of water gushes right into Firestorm just as he flies over it! “YEOWW!” Ronnie yells, thrust back upwards wildly by the hydraulic blast! </p><p>Borne upward on a column of pressurized water, Firestorm barely has time to free himself before… “Watch it, Sonny!” Superman says as he plucks him out of mid-air, “Keep those eyes open for low-flying helicopters!” Ronnie feels the impact of someone behind him. “Huh?” he blurts. “Don’t you think your time would be better spent crashing into the bad guys rather than innocent passers-by?” Superman asks. </p><p>Ronnie looks back and gasps in shock. “Who the - - ulp! It’s - - it’s - - it’s…” he stutters in a mixture of confused excitement. “Say it,” the Man of Steel suggests. “Superman!” Ronnie cries out in amazement. “Right the first time,” nods Superman, asking, “Er, much as I’d like to chat - - haven’t you forgotten something?” Superman points at the street down below them. “Hmm?” the distracted Ronnie mumbles as he looks down, groaning, “Oh, great!” He smacks his forehead in frustration. “Multiplex! Both of him, gone!” he exclaims, “While I hung around with my tongue out like some star-struck teenybopper - - they escaped! I had them - - and I blew it!”</p><p> Superman and Firestorm land in the street near the still-spewing fire hydrant. “Relax. Everyone makes mistakes,” Superman reassures him. “You don’t!” Ronnie blurts back. “Think so?” Superman asks, adding, “Remind me to tell you about a former friend of mine named Lex Luthor!” Ronnie looks back and forth quickly. “Where could they be?” he wonders. </p><p>Ronnie walks dejectedly, fixing the fire hydrant with a restructuring burst. “While I’m repairing myself I’ve got to think - - try to remember any clue…” Ronnie ponders. Superman watches his young friend. “He’s so eager, so desperate to succeed,” thinks the Man of Steel, “He makes the Red Tornado look like an underachiever!” </p><p>Stein takes an analytical approach. “Ronald…remember what Multiplex wants, by his own admission,” he explains, “Atomic energy to increase his strength! Apparently he requires it for survival as a duplicate being…and where is the nearest nuclear plant - - apart from my own Hudson Plant? A plant he’s already drained?” Ronnie thinks quickly. “State University - - they’ve got an experimental pile in their physics lab!” Ronnie recalls. “Gotta run, Superman!” Ronnie calls as he leaps skyward, “Just maybe - - I’ve got my lead!” </p><p>Some few minutes later, on the campus of State U., just north of Central Park in Manhattan…The twin Multiplexes busily work at breaking into the experimental pile. “More energy - - and we’ll have all the power we need!” one twin says. SCRUNCH! The gloved hand of his twin rips at the door. “If we can rip twelve-inch lead shielding off a wall,” he answers, “imagine what we‘ll do to bank vaults!”</p><p> With a low chuckle, Multiplex drops the ten-ton door to the ground, but when they step within the green-lit reactor room… “Bank vaults? Really, fellas, I’m disappointed,” Firestorm announces as they walk in, “I thought for sure you jerks were out to rule the world or some dumb thing, and now I find out you’re nothing but a pair of second-rate safecrackers!”</p><p> Multiplex looks at him in surprise. “You! How could you get in here - - an airtight room?” he asks in disbelief. “Through the wall, bozo - - How else?” Ronnie asks. The two Multiplexes break into a sprint, running for the atomic pile right behind Firestorm. “Doesn’t matter! We’re too fast for you, fool!” Multiplex growls, “See? We’ve already reached the atomic pile!”</p><p> Ronnie wheels about and fires a nuclear burst. ZZZOMM! It rockets through the air, but Multiplex sidesteps out of the way! The burst smashes into the atomic pile. “Ha! You’re so rattled, you can’t even hit us with your blast-beams!” Multiplex laughs, “You had your chance, your one chance, and you missed! Now it’s our turn!” </p><p>The twin Multiplexes reach their hands out to make contact with the atomic pile. “A moment, and we’ll have absorbed the radiation in this pile!” one duplicate says. His twin suddenly recoils in discomfort, doubling over and clutching his hand over his face. “No! We’re weakening - - draining our own energy!” he groans. “Something’s wrong with the pile!” he exclaims. “It’s - - it’s empty - - and the absorption effort - - is backfiring!” his twin blurts. “What’s happening?” he yells in shock. “In two words, couplet - - You lose!” Ronnie yells. BALAMMO! Firestorm blasts both duplicates with stunning punches! The twin Multiplexes tumble back and fall, unable to continue the fight. </p><p>Superman strolls into the airlock. “Nicely handled, Firestorm,” he smiles, “But what did you do?” Ronnie explains, “That off-target blast wasn’t off-target! I used my atom-altering power to change the uranium in that pile to harmless phosphorescence…When they absorbed it - - I guess they just blew a fuse!” Superman and Firestorm bend down and remove the helmet-masks from the two Multiplexes. “Recognize them, son?” Superman asks. “’They’ is a fella named Danton Black,” Ronnie explains, “Let’s get them to a hospital.” </p><p>Shortly, at the Downtown Medical Center… “Weird. Black must have been at the Hudson Plant when Earhart’s bomb went off,” Ronnie thinks. He stands in a hospital room watching doctors tend to Multiplex. “He was caught in the same radiation blast as we were,” Ronnie figures, “But in his case, it had a fission effect, instead of the fusion that joined us…Now without a radiation charge, the ‘split-up’ that made Multiplex is wearing off.”</p><p> The two Multiplexes shimmer in rippling yellow light, and slowly their two separate forms merge back into one body. “Thing is, will Black remember what happened?” Ronnie wonders, “And if he gets near a reactor - - will it happen again?” Stein looks over the single Multiplex warily. “True, Ronald,” he answers, “I fear this was just - - an introduction!” </p><p>And, after the unconscious Danton Black has been removed to a high security area of the center… “Son, you’ve got promise,” Superman tells Firestorm with an appreciative smile. “I do?” Ronnie says with eyes wide in excitement. “You aren’t ready yet, but someday - - maybe soon - - I just might nominate you for the Justice League,” Superman explains. </p><p>“You will?” Ronnie gasps. Overjoyed, Ronnie leaps up into the sky. He banks, dives, and barrel rolls in glee. “Fan-taas-tic! Maybe I’m not such a screw-up after all!” he cries happily, “Outa my way, world! Nothing can stop me now!” </p><p>Guaranteed: This is nowhere near - - the end!</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Firestorm drops in on Cliff Carmichael outside Bradley High School. Professor Stein flies to the Mohole One project in the Arctic Circle, invited there by a former student who needs Stein's experimental condensor unit for the prototype Thermafrost energy generating system. A freak accident in the Thermafrost unit creates...Killer Frost!</em></p><p><ins><strong>Firestorm826's Panel-by-Panel Story Summary (Spoiler Alert)</strong></ins></p><p>“Ronald, this is outrageous! You may indeed be late for school, but I’m overdue at a military airbase!” Professor Stein cries out in irritation as Ronnie dives down out of the sky over Bradley High School. “Our dual identity as Firestorm is a privilege and a responsibility - - not an alternative for the subway!” Stein chides, asking, “Ronald are you listening?” Ronnie focuses intently on his target below. “I hear you, Professor Stein, but I just caught sight of a worm I know,” Ronnie replies, “So ‘scuse me while I give the creep a thrill!” </p><p>Ronnie swoops at high speed out of the sky right above…Cliff Carmichael! “YAAH!” Cliff yells in out in surprise, dropping his textbooks as he dodges out of the way. Firestorm turns and lands quickly next to Cliff. “Y-You’re that Firestorm guy, the one all the newspapers are writing about!” Cliff stammers, nervously looking up at the Nuclear Man, asking, “Wh-Wha-What’re you doing at Bradley High - - a-an-and what do you want - - with me?” </p><p>Ronnie leans down menacingly, grabbing Cliff by the shirt. “Clifford Carmichael - - I want words with you,” Ronnie snarls through gritted teeth, “My sources claim you referred to me as a ‘mental midget - - hung up on violence!’ Is that true?” Cliff answers hesitantly, “M-Maybe I was a l-little rash,” he sputters, gasping, “Urrk!” Ronnie scowls at him. “I’ll warn you once, Carmichael…Nobody likes a smart mouth, and if you’re making cracks about me…or anyone…I’ll plant you where you’ll bring up roses!” Ronnie threatens. “Ga-ga-yulp!” Cliff stutters back anxiously. </p><p>Ronnie releases Cliff’s shirt and Cliff sits back cowering. “Aw, lookit the guy - - I’ve scared him so much he’s speechless! This is just too easy!” Ronnie thinks as he leaps skyward. “Are you done, Ronald?” asks an impatient Professor, adding, “If so, there’s a slim chance I can still catch my plane…provided you ferry me out to Long Island!”</p><p> Ronnie turns sharply and comes to a landing near Bradley High. “Sorry, Professor, no can do!” he answers. Stein grows frustrated. “What? Ronald, I may be the dormant persona in our dual ego, but I resent the way you cavalierly hauled me from my Westchester nuclear lab - - all the way into Manhattan - - just so you could intimidate your high school rival!” he complains. Ronnie walks them to an isolated spot. “I said I was sorry, okay?” he answers. </p><p>Martin Stein’s persona replies with angry silence, which lasts until the Nuclear Man drops into a concealing alley - - concentrates - - and splits, once again, into teenaged student - - and middle-aged scientist. </p><p>Then… “How on Earth did I get here?” Professor Stein asks in disoriented bewilderment. He rubs his forehead and glances around. “I should be on Long Island…at the airfield!” he frets anxiously, “My God, I must have had another black-out…the fourth since the accident at my nuclear plant!” He starts walking out of the alley towards the street. “Am I losing my mind?” he worries, “Lord in Heaven - - what’s been happening to me?” </p><p>Ronnie walks back toward Bradley High, looking over his shoulder at the confused Professor. “I feel lousy about this,” Ronnie thinks, “treating the Professor and our ‘Firestorm’ persona like a private taxicab…but heck, I didn’t ask for this scene, did I?” Ronnie heads in to his locker and gets his textbooks for class. “It’s too bad the Prof never remembers being Firestorm,” he thinks, “But that’s because he was unconscious when we were hit by all that radiation…” </p><p>Ronnie looks up and sees his nemesis Cliff Carmichael approaching. “Uh-oh! Here comes Carmichael!” Ronnie thinks, “I better get ready for a real put down.” Ronnie calls out, “Uh…Hi, Cliff. What’s doing?” Cliff walks with his head down, looking somewhat demoralized. He glances up at Ronnie and returns his gaze to the floor as he shuffles past. “Oh…Hello, Raymond,” Cliff says softly, “Have a nice day…seeya later…” Ronnie smiles as his defanged rival continues down the hallway. “Well, now I know one way to keep that big mouth zipped,” Ronnie thinks happily, “though it’s kinda like swatting flies with a bazooka…” </p><p>Doreen spots Ronnie in the hallway. “Say, there’s Ronnie! I wonder what he’s doing after the basketball game tonight?” she thinks, calling out, “Howdy, handsome. Got a date for the…” Her voice trails off as Ronnie walks away without noticing her. “Still, even though scaring Cliff with Firestorm isn’t the sort of thing I’d do twice, it’s nice to know it’s there!” Ronnie smiles as he heads to class, “Now if only I could figure a way to use the Professor’s smarts to help me pass my chemistry exam…” </p><p>“Ronnie? Ronnie?” Doreen calls to him. He keeps walking, lost in his daydreaming. “Of all the nerve! He didn’t even hear me!” she thinks with a touch of irritation, “Either that - - or I’ve just been dumped! I’ll give him one more chance after school, and if he ignores me again…” </p><p>A huge military transport jet takes off from an Air Force base on Long Island. Professor Stein, able to make his flight, worries about his punctuality. “My apologies for being late, General Casper,” he explains, “but I was - - ah - - detained in Manhattan for an emergency meeting.” The General eyes Stein a bit skeptically. “Could you explain to me again, why I’m needed so desperately in the Arctic?” Stein asks. </p><p>“It’s not you, Stein, it’s your experimental condenser,” the General replies, “The brain-boys up at Mohole One are trying to find ways to use heat from the Earth’s core for energy…They built the plant in the Arctic so they could use the natural cold for cooling and superconducting...” Stein opens his briefcase and lifts out his prototype. “…but they need this condenser to make the system practical!” Stein continues, “I understand now, General.” The General nods, adding gruffly, “Then let’s zip it, Mister. We’ve got a ten hour trip ahead of us - - and if there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s a trap-flapping egghead!” </p><p>And so, ten and a half hours of uneasy silence later, the Arctic clouds part before the descending Air Force craft to reveal - - “Mohole One, Stein!” General Casper announces, “Take a good look - - it just might be the last hope of an energy-starved world!” The jet lands a few minutes later and taxis near the sprawling complex.</p><p> </p><p>“Obviously, Casper doesn’t think much of my own work with nuclear reactors…not that I blame the man,” Stein thinks as he walks down the stairs from the jet. “Even with the highest safety standards, such as those on the plant I designed myself - - a reactor is still a dreadfully chancy device,” he thinks, “If this Mohole project can relieve the energy problem, perhaps I should shift my efforts, or…eh? That woman - - waving at me…”</p><p>Stein steps off the stairs to a group that has assembled on the tarmac awaiting the jet’s arrival. One woman began waving to him as soon as he emerged from the plane. Stein walks up to meet her. “Lord in Heaven, it’s Crystal - - Crystal Frost!” Stein exclaims in surprise, “I haven’t seen you in years, since you were my student at Hudson University!” She gives him a warm smile as he rests his hands on her shoulders to take a good look at her. “It’s Doctor Frost now, Martin. I’ve come a long way,” she explains, “The cooling system on this plant is mostly my design - - in fact, you’re here on my recommendation…”</p><p>A man behind Dr. Frost steps up impatiently. “Don’t hog the man, Frost,” he interjects, adding, “Professor Stein, my name’s Loew…and I’m Project Director for Mohole One.” Loew turns to two other men next to him. “This is Doctor French and Professor Clair,” he continues, adding, “We’re all looking forward to working with you.” Dr. Frost looks perturbed that she has been pushed out of the way. Dr. French extends a handshake to Stein. “Zair is much we have to discuss, mon ami,” French says. Clair nods in agreement. “Quite. Your paper on thermal resistance was truly illuminating, Stein,” he adds, suggesting, “Let’s get inside - - out of the cold.”</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Frost fumes at her colleagues. “Yes, why don’t you?” she thinks, “And while you’re at it, ignore me completely?” She stands watching the men exchanging pleasantries. “It’s been this way since the project started. This male clique…isolating me, shutting me out…simply because of my gender!” she thinks angrily. “Well, now that Martin’s here, that will change…”, she figures, announcing to the others, “Gentlemen, if you don’t mind…Professor Stein came here for a purpose. With your permission, I’ll show him our problem.”</p><p> </p><p>Soon, in the massive refrigeration unit which dominates several acres of the project compound… “Don’t let the others mislead you, Martin…This is my brain-child,” Dr. Frost explains as she and Stein observe the huge and complex system. Dr. Frost raises her arms with pride as she looks over her creation. “Because of the tremendous heat we’ll soon be piping up from the planetary core, we need a super-efficient system,” she explains, “This…What I call the Thermafrost!” Stein surveys the complicated machinery and equipment. “An automatic relay keeps the temperature in here comfortable when the central door is open,” Frost continues, “But when it’s shut - - the unit drops to minus 1000 degrees Centigrade - - instantly!” Frost leads him along the pathway next to the machinery. “If you’ll step outside, I’ll show you where the difficulty lies…” she directs him as Stein makes some adjustments to his condenser prototype.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s so good to be near him again, to know that we’re finally together, after all these years…” Dr. Frost thinks happily. “All my life, I’ve wanted only one thing…To be respected for myself, not for my womanhood or my beauty,” she recalls, “Throughout childhood, I was constantly tormented by my peers for my aloofness…but I’d hoped, when I entered college, that the tormenting would stop…”</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Frost’s mind drifts back to her time at Hudson University. “For a time it seemed that it had,” she remembers, “Studying engineering physics under Professor Stein, I found myself accepted as a scholar first, a woman second…I think that’s when I fell in love with Martin Stein…and I believe he secretly fell in love with me…As for other men - - I found them boring, patronizing and aggressive. None of them desired me for my mind, as I’m sure Martin did.”</p><p> </p><p>She thinks back to encounters with men on campus. “When I snubbed them, they called me ‘The Ice Maiden,’ because they thought I was afraid of love…” she thinks, “But the truth is, I’ve never been afraid. I’ve only wanted one man, a man who would treat me as an equal…not like Loew or French or that idiot Clair. They ignore me because of my womanhood…but Martin…”</p><p> </p><p>Stein examines the equipment as she reminisces. “I think I understand your problem, Crystal,” he announces, “You’re pulling too much power through your condensers. Using my device…” Dr. Frost peels off her glasses and walks up behind Professor Stein. She wraps her arms around him, resting her head just behind his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“To hell with the project, Martin. Isn’t it time we were honest with ourselves?” she tells him softly, “I love you, Martin. You see me as more than a woman…” Stein is shocked by her amorous advance. “Of course I do, Crystal. You’re a scientist, I’m a scientist…How else should I see you?” he answers a bit nervously, “And what in God’s name has all that got to do with love?” Dr. Frost’s smile melts away and she looks horrified. “You - - don’t - - love me?” she asks in dismay. “Crystal, I’m confused,” Stein answers, “Didn’t you ask me here to help you with the cooling system?” Dr. Frost anxiously steps away. “Yes! No! I…” she stammers, “Damn you! Of all the men in the world, I thought you’d understand me! But you don’t care!” She turns and starts to storm off. “Crystal, what…?” Stein asks. “Oh, go talk with the rest of the men!” she scoffs, “I hope this gives you all a good laugh!”</p><p> </p><p>She walks alone back to the Thermafrost unit, upset and emotional from Stein’s rejection of her feelings for him. “I should have known. I was a fool to think Stein would be different…but like every man, he’s blind…and stupid!” she fumes. “How could I have made such a fool of myself?” she ponders, “Behaving like some schoolgirl, simpering and whining - - as though I needed him! It’s not like me, not like me at all!”</p><p> </p><p>She notices the door ajar to the system’s interior. “Eh? The Thermafrost unit - - we left the self-locking door open!” she worries, “As long as it’s open, the unit holds a normal temperature…and the unit isn’t build to operate in such heat! Some crucial element might have been damaged!” She hastily walks inside to check the system. “This is all Martin’s fault! If he hadn’t distracted me, I would have seen this…”</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly her shoulder bumps the door and it starts to swing closed. “Oh my God,” Dr. Frost gasps in horror, yelling, “The door - - I’ve knocked it shut!” She watches helplessly as the door latches closed, automatically triggering the unit to instantly plunge the room temperature to minus 1000 degrees Centigrade!</p><p> </p><p>Several hours later, Dr. Frost’s absence has been noticed by her colleagues and they gather near the Thermafrost unit. “…no sign of Doctair Frost anywhere, mon ami,” Dr. French observes in his heavy accent, “We have searched zee compound twice in zee past two hours. She is nowhere!” Stein shakes his head with worry. “I can’t help feeling this is my fault…” he says somberly. “You can’t mean that, Stein,” Clair questions.</p><p> </p><p>Stein sighs. “I do, Clair,” Stein explains, “As a student, Crystal was always withdrawn…perhaps psychotically so. She seemed to be in constant conflict with herself…and because I once tried to draw her out I’m afraid she misinterpreted my motives…When we were talking earlier, she said…” Loew quickly interrupts, asking, “Where? Where were you talking?” Stein nods at the unit. “Here, outside the Thermafrost unit,” he replies, “Then she told me to go away, and I…” His voice trails off with fear. “Lord…you don’t suppose…?” he asks nervously.</p><p> </p><p>Doctor Loew rushes for the door, grabbing the locking wheel. “Quick! Someone help me get this door unlocked!” he cries out, “Maybe the unit malfunctioned! Doctor Frost might still be alive, by some miracle! But we’ve got to hurry!” He finally forces the locking wheel to budge, rotating it quickly to unlock the heavy sealing door. “There! It’s opening!” he says, warning, “Stand back, there’ll be a blast of cold air from…” Stein peers inside. “Great Jehoshaphat!” he yells in horror, “Someone’s in there! Moving! It’s Crystal!</p><p> </p><p>TRABOOM! The door blasts open and a huge angry tempest of frozen air sweeps out from the Thermafrost unit! The group of men is blown back helplessly by the power. A female form slowly emerges from inside. “Wrong, Martin Stein! Crystal Frost is dead, killed by your rejection! And the instant she died - - Killer Frost was born!” she hisses as she walks towards them. “Something happened in that super-cold Thermafrost,” she explains, “Every atom and molecule in my body has been frozen…crystallized!” She walks next to Dr. Loew and reaches her hand to his chin. “You men once called me an Ice Maiden,” she says, “Now you’ll see how right you were…” She kisses Dr. Loew. Instantly, he freezes solid!</p><p> </p><p>The other men look on in terror and scramble to get away. “What’s wrong, Martin? You’re running from me,” Killer Frost calls, asking, “Don’t you love me anymore? Won’t you hold me in your arms?” She walks slowly after them, the body of Dr. Loew standing behind her. A look of horror is on Loew’s face, his body covered head-to-toe in arctic blue ice. “Or are you afraid…you’ll become…like him?” she asks.</p><p> </p><p>Several armed soldiers suddenly appear in the corridor. They sprint toward the Thermafrost unit with their rifles at ready. “What’s this? You’ve called the Project Security Force?” Killer Frost says as she watches the guards approach.</p><p> </p><p>“Cripes, what kinda girl is that?” a soldier asks in shock. “Whatever she is, we better surround her till General Casper gets here!” another answers. “The scientists have all fled! It’s just us…” a third soldier yells to his squad mates.</p><p> </p><p>“True, fool! And soon it shall be - - just me!” Killer Frost shrieks at them. She raises her hands, pointing at the soldiers, and…SHHSH! Icy beams flow from her fingertips into the oncoming men. Instantly, ice begins to form over them!</p><p> </p><p>“She’s throwin’ ice!? Lookout, before it - - AAAHH!” a soldier cries out. “Unn - - freezing over! Can’t move! Can’t even - - yuhh!” another groans as super-cold waves flood his body.</p><p> </p><p>With a brittle laugh like ice breaking, Killer Frost rises on a swirl of cold air, in swift pursuit of the fleeing scientists - - and one scientist in particular named Stein!</p><p> </p><p>And, at that very moment in Manhattan’s Bradley High...The gymnasium stands are filled with students and spectators to watch tonight’s basketball game. “Ha! I’ve got you cornered, Hamilton! Ain’t no way you can make the basket from here!” a defender yells. “I can’t,” Hamilton answers, “But Ronnie can! Do it brother!” Hamilton feeds a pass to his teammate Ronnie trailing the play. Ronnie grabs the ball and dribbles to the post. He jumps and shoots and…</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a score by Ronnie Raymond!” the P.A. announcer calls excitedly, “Bradley High leads by twelve points!” The crowd cheers happily as the teams start the next play. “Go, Ronnie, go! Go, Ronnie, go!” yell several students. “Heeeey Ronnie!” Doreen sings out to him as he runs in front of her. “I don’t care if I am mad at him!” she thinks, “Ronnie makes the rest of these guys look like they’re standing still!”</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie jogs into position. “Wow, I just wish Dad were here tonight, instead of at his newspaper!” he thinks as he surveys the happy crowds, “It’s great to feel part of something - - to have people like you! After all the other schools I’ve gone to, this is…” He suddenly recognizes his girlfriend waving to him excitedly. “Hey, there’s Doreen!” he thinks.</p><p> </p><p>Something unusual near her catches his eye. “But - - isn’t that Principal Hapgood in the row behind her?” Ronnie thinks, “He looks upset - - worried! Who’s that guy he’s talking to?” A man in a long tan trench coat leans next to Hapgood. He rests his hand on Hapgood’s shoulder and his wide-brimmed hat is pulled low, obscuring his face. “Dr. Hapgood is one of Dad’s oldest friends!” Ronnie thinks, “If something’s wrong with…” Hamilton’s voice nearby interrupts Ronnie’s thoughts. “Wake up, Ronnie!” Hamilton yells, “It’s your ball - - Go, my man, go!”</p><p> </p><p>But fate is about to deal Ronnie Raymond an unkind blow, for, simultaneously - - many miles to the north… “You’ve reached a dead end, Martin Stein…Your own!” Killer Frost tells him ominously as she closes in. Stein cowers against a wall, cornered and unable to get away. “Kiss me, Martin! Kiss your scorned lover!” she says threateningly, “Kiss the lips of Killer Frost!” She clutches his head and kisses him!</p><p> </p><p>“Yeow!” Ronnie yells out in shock. “All of a sudden, I’m freezing!” he thinks anxiously, “Only one possible reason - - something’s happening to Professor Stein!” Ronnie drops the ball and sprints off the court as his teammates look on in bewilderment. “Ronnie, are you nuts?” Hamilton calls to him, “It’s your shot!” Opponents scramble for the loose ball. “No time out was called!” the referee tells the players, “The ball is still in play!”</p><p> </p><p>The crowd gasps, unable to comprehend Ronnie’s sudden turnover and quick departure. “Bradley High - - loses ball - - recovered by Rollins” the P.A. announcer calls out. “What a bozo!” Cliff snorts, “I knew it all along!” Doreen glances at Cliff. “Oh, Ronnie…” she worries.</p><p> </p><p>But, in the locker room, out of sight of teammates and audience, Ronnie Raymond is undergoing a dramatic change, a change that sends him hurtling through space instantaneously - - to form the composite Nuclear Man…</p><p> </p><p>“Holy Hannah! This is danger?” Ronnie thinks as he looks in the instant after fusion to find himself in the arms of a woman that is kissing him. “Wow, I could handle this sort of trouble all the time!” Ronnie thinks, kissing her back, “I must’ve misread the Prof’s signals, but just so the trip isn’t a total waste, I’ll - - huh?” He quickly feels something amiss. “What’s going on? I can’t break away - - and I’m starting to ice up!” Ronnie thinks nervously, “I’m freezing!” Ice starts to form across his face as he struggles to pull away.</p><p> </p><p>It takes only seconds, and then, drawing back, Killer Frost finally sees her victim, and snarls with anger… “Impossible! Somehow Martin slipped away while I was reaching for him, leaving this costumed fool in his place!” she rages. She quickly turns and moves away, floating mysteriously a few feet above the floor. “He may have escaped me momentarily…but he will not stay hidden for long!” she vows as she heads off down the corridor.</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie stands motionless, ice hanging thickly down from his body. “Professor…help me…” Ronnie pleads. Ice obscures his face, and the flames of his hair have gone out. “You can’t imagine my gratitude for your appearance, Ronald,” Stein answers, “but I can provide little help but advice! Only you can provide the decision to act! Use your nuclear heat, Ronald! Thaw yourself - - quickly, before the frost reaches your brain!”</p><p> </p><p>Dimly, as though through a curtain, Firestorm hears distant shouts, the tinkling of ice, a high-pitched laugh…The sounds are a spur, and with an effort, he stirs his cold-numbed thoughts, and activates the atomic furnace of his body…while, in the distance, the shouts grow fewer…and fainter…with each passing moment! Seconds become minutes, and, when ten of those have passed, a threshold is reached - - and exceeded - - with a satisfying - - SHOOM!</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie flexes his body and the ice crackles off and falls away! His hair erupts in nuclear fire! “I’ve cracked the ice! I’m free!” he cries out, leaping in pursuit of the Ice Maiden. “One thing I just don’t get, Professor: Why is it Ronnie always travels to where you are, when we become Firestorm?” Stein thinks for a few seconds, then looks at Killer Frost. “An interesting problem, Ronald,” he answers, “perhaps suited for pursuing another time.” Ronnie follows in the direction of the sounds down the corridor. “Gotcha, Professor,” he replies, “Once I pass through this wall, I can…”</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie lowers his atomic density and phases through. “There she is!” he yells as he flies into the room. SKRASK! Killer Frost attacks, unleashing a barrage of jagged ice shards! “Whoops! So much for the benefit of surprise!” Ronnie thinks as he barely dodges the frozen daggers, “I blew that one - - big!”</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie lands and aims his hands quickly at Killer Frost. He unleashes bursts of nuclear heat at her. “You better fill me in on this lady fast, Professor,” Ronnie asks, “But until you do, I’ll stall her with some heat blasts! After all, if she can toss icicles like spears, then she’ll probably just hate - - say what?”</p><p> </p><p>Incredibly, Killer Frost smiles and basks in the radiant heat flowing from Firestorm, absorbing it with no apparent harm! “She’s eating it up!” Ronnie yells in disbelief, “She actually likes the heat treatment! But that doesn’t make sense!” Killer Frost seems to be gaining power. Ronnie halts the heat blasts. “She should be melting, and instead, she’s grinning - - and she’s stronger than ever!”</p><p> </p><p>Killer Frost raises her hands above her head, aiming cold blasts into the ceiling. “Now what? Firing blasts of her ice-power into the ceiling?” Ronnie asks anxiously, asking, “Has she flipped - - or have I?” Suddenly, the ceiling collapses! “Gangway! Now I get it” Ronnie cries out, “Icing up the ceiling, she made it too heavy to support its own weight! It’s coming down like a hail of cannonballs! If even one of them hits me…” THOOM! KRASH!</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie ducks and dodges the heavy debris. “Only one way to deal with that!” Ronnie exclaims, “Besides heat, I’ve got another nifty power: I can rearrange atomic structure with a flick of the wrist, changing those ice spears - - into half-pound snowflakes the size of Frisbees! Put that in your hat, Ice-Lady!” Killer Frost looks on in amazement. “Whoever you are - - whatever you are,” she gasps, “Your power is incredible!”</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie turns to face her. “Glad you think so, sister - - ‘cause here’s where I use it on you!” Stein tries to stop him, yelling as Ronnie unleashes a restructuring burst, “Ronald, don’t try it! You’ve never used your nuclear touch on organic, living beings! The reaction is unpredictable!”</p><p> </p><p>ZAWHOOM! The nuclear touch ricochets right back at Firestorm! “Yaaah!” Ronnie yells as the blast smashes into him, knocking him to the ground. “You sure called it, Professor…My blast must’ve boomeranged,” Ronnie says, rubbing his neck, “and it whomped me something fierce!” Killer Frost sees her target down and moves away around the hallway corner. “You may be dazed, Ronald, but apparently you’re not seriously injured,” Stein observes, adding, “Just don’t lose Doctor Frost!”</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie quickly gets up and leaps down the corridor. “Lose her? If I had my way, I’d never go near that crazy lady again!” he replies, “See what I do for you, Prof? Still mad because I use us for a bus sometimes?” Stein replies, “I see that you are a complicated young man, Ronald. You have a good heart - - though you are somewhat immature!” Ronnie turns the corner and sees Killer Frost just ahead. “Oh, yeah? This conversation’s getting on my nerves, Prof!” he answers, “Why don’t we just put it on hold until after I - - yeeowie!</p><p> </p><p>KRASH! A section of wall slams into Ronnie’s chest, knocking him back sharply! “You underestimated me, boy! Because of my femininity, you thought me weak!” Killer Frost yells out, “But I am strong! Strong!” The huge wall section settle to the ground on top of Firestorm! “This frozen wall will have flattened you…a pity, since I have so many questions!” Killer Frost says, asking, “Who were you? Why were you here? How did you get your powers? Now those questions will never be answered…” She kneels down next to the wall. She curls her hand around the edge to lift it, looking underneath. “Eh?” she blurts in surprise, “Gone?”</p><p> </p><p>Below her, Ronnie looks up at the floor overhead. “Good thing I can alter my atoms to slip through solid objects…otherwise there’d be more on that floor than a puddle of melted ice! Whew!” he thinks as Killer Frost grows enraged. “So now what, Professor?” Ronnie asks, “Like the lady said, she’s a heckuva lot more powerful than I ever imagined! Which brings up a point you’ve never explained - - who is this Killer Frost cutie? And howcum she had you in a bearhug when I arrived?”</p><p> </p><p>Stein sighs, explaining, “Crystal Frost is a sad woman, Ronald, a victim of social pressures which demanded more than she could provide…” Ronnie nods. “Too bad for her. I mean, I’m sorry she’s had a tough life - - but right now, she’s trying to kill us, so let’s drop the psychoanalysis stuff and figure a way out of this mess! She’s got ice powers - - what else?” Overhead, ice begins to seep through the ceiling from the floor above and faint cracking noises ring out. “Apparently, she also absorbs heat - - otherwise your nuclear fire would have melted her,” Stein explains. “Uh-huh…go on…” Ronnie listens.</p><p> </p><p>Literally lost in conversation with himself, Firestorm doesn’t hear the creaking of freezing beams above him…Her hearing sensitized by her icy shell, Killer Frost has pinpointed the murmur of Firestorm’s voice, and though she can’t understand the words, she doesn’t really have to…She knows what she wants…and what she wants is his death!</p><p> </p><p>SHOOM! Suddenly, the weakened floor gives way! Killer Frost plunges through on top of Firestorm! “Oboy!” Ronnie gasps, barely dodging out of her path. “Don’t you ever quit?” he asks, “This is getting monotonous!” She lands and gets to her feet, aiming another salvo of ice lances at him. “Ronald, I have it!” Stein announces excitedly. “So give it to me, already!” Ronnie tells him as he ducks.</p><p> </p><p>“When you first arrived, you tried fighting her with heat…and we quickly realized that she was immune to temperature changes,” Stein rapidly explains, “But, Ronald, we were wrong!” Ronnie bends to dodge another ice barrage. “That’s what you think! I could toss this lady in a furnace and she wouldn’t even bat an eye!” Ronnie exclaims.</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly, Ronald!” Stein continues, “To review - - she first showed herself when the Thermafrost unit was opened, and by opening the unit, we activated the automatic controls - - which raised the temperature instantly to ‘normal!’ Until then she was immobile - - frozen! In the same way, she absorbed heat from the men she kissed - - freezing them by the absence of warmth, not the presence of cold! This leads us to one conclusion, Ronald! Killer Frost needs warmth - - she thrives on it, lives for it! Without it - - she should be helpless!”</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie quickly surveys the room. “And that gives me an idea!” he exclaims. He takes aim at Killer Frost. “Imbecile! What are you doing?” she shrieks at him, “You can’t harm me with your - - eh?” The bursts from Firestorm rocket past her and the walls begin to transform. Killer Frost looks back and forth around her quickly. “Or - - can you? You didn’t aim at me,” she blurts, “You’ve changed the atoms in the walls - - created some sort of - - refrigeration unit?”</p><p> </p><p>Killer Frost trembles suddenly, feeling her energy weakening. “NO!” she yells, “You’ve turned this room into a Thermafrost unit!” Ronnie turns from her and lowers his atomic density. He thrusts himself through the wall. “Come back! You can’t do this!” Killer Frost yells after him.</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie passes through the other side and quickly lands. He turns back, facing the Thermafrost unit’s window. “That’s where you’re wrong, Frost,” he calls back, aiming a nuclear burst into the system controls, “I’ve already activated the freezer…and it’s already begun…”</p><p> </p><p>Killer Frost looks out at him through the window. “Noooooo! she cries. She steps next to the window, a thick pane of glass the only object between her face and Firestorm’s. “Please…I just wanted…to punish them for hurting me…Please don’t leave me…in here…please…” she begs tearfully. She quickly resumes her rage. “Damn you! You’re like the rest! Like all of them!” she yells in fury, “If I could get out, I’d kill you! Kill you! K-k-kill - - k-k-k-k-k….”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice gets softer and softer. Slowly, she stops moving, her body frozen in an angry, tormented stance. Ronnie looks through the window into the unit at her. “Did…Did it have to be this way, Professor? I never wanted to hurt her…” Stein looks in at his anguished former student. “You had no choice, Ronald,” Stein says reassuringly, “Perhaps now, for the first time, you understand the responsibilities of your power…Perhaps the brash young boy…is becoming a man.” Ronnie walks slowly out of the Thermafrost unit area. He walks past a long line of frozen soldiers and scientists, encased in ice as if time has stopped. “I just wish it didn’t happen so fast…” Ronnie says softly. “It always does, Ronald,” Stein replies, “It always does.”</p>",
