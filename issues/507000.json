    "description": "<p><em>Going to the hospital for a physical is never on the top of anyoneâs list of fun summer activities. For Melissa Collins, she could think of a dozen things sheâd rather do with her day. The successful career woman is constantly on the go, bouncing from meetings to power lunches. Sheâs always been aware of her beauty, and how itâs helped her get ahead in the business world. Considering her good looks one of her top assets, sheâs careful to make sure sheâs in perfect physical healthâ¦ even if it means undergoing uncomfortable physical exams twice a year.</em></p><p><em>Life hasnât been kind to Dr. Ned. Born a dwarf, he seemed destined to go through life as an outcast. His stunted body was an automatic target for teasing by bullies and girls alike. But what he lacked in height, he made up for in brains. Ned worked feverishly to get his medical degree and establish a thriving practice. But success has never brought him a curvaceous woman to flaunt in public. Without a sexy babe waiting on him hand and foot, he feels like a homely runt. Wanting what taller men seem to get so easily, he burns with repressed lust and anger.</em></p><p><em>For Melissa, sheâs come to expect people to automatically cater to her needs. Her natural charisma has made her successful, and sheâs accustomed to getting her way. Although sheâs a sensual young woman, she keeps romance at armâs length. Her past relationships have been sweet, but never wild. When her new doctor, a leggy blonde woman, innocently flirts with her, sheâs shocked! Embarrassed, but also furious at the casual flirtation, Melissa demands to see a new doctor.</em></p><p><em>When the dwarf doctor realizes the sexy brunette is his new patient, he plans to take care of her body in ways she canât possibly imagine. The busty Melissa will turn heads as he parades her around as his devoted, submissive girlfriend, or in other words, his miserable sex-slave...</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The smells of the medial ward have always put Gina on edge. The young woman wrinkles her pert nose as she waits for her routine physical exam. A metallic tang of antiseptic hangs in the air along with the cloying scent of cheap chlorine. She senses something elseâ¦ but canât put her finger on it. Ether? Or maybe chloroform? But that canât beâ¦</em></p><p><em>The constricting leather cuffs on her wrists wake the beautiful brunette. Her senses reel and the harsh fluorescent lights are almost blinding. The glare is painful, and she tries to shade her eyes but something binds her hands firmly to the bed frame. Straps? She tries to focus on the heavy restraints but they swim before her. The only thing clear in the sterile examination room is the pounding of her heart, which grows louder every minute!</em></p><p><em>Dr. Nerd. The deformed doctor. The medical midget. Heâs heard them all and hates every one. Every nickname is a sarcastic jab at his size. Some men may quietly take the taunts but not him. When youâve got a beautiful woman hanging on your arm, people look up to you. And the more sexy and voluptuous the woman, the more respect you get. All heâs got to do is find the perfect woman. One who is completely under his thumb and terrified to leave his side!</em></p><p><em>Dr. Nerd runs his hands over Gina's body, feeling her smooth skin shiver beneath his touch.</em></p><p><em>She stares at him, eyes wide with horror. This canât be happening to her, she thinks. Desperately trying to squirm away from him roving hands, the straps binding her to the exam table constrict further. She yanks at the harness with increasing panic when a low chuckle brings her back to the doctor.</em></p><p><em>The look of lust glittering in his cold eyes is startling, and she can only watch helplessly as he reaches for his bulging medical bagâ¦</em></p><p><em>A dreadful journey to a world of humiliation and despair begins for beautiful Gina...</em></p><p> </p>",

Every corner of the remote house has been turned into a training facility where young, buxom women are taught to submit to his sick commands. Rusty cages and sturdy chains line the garage, and not all of them are empty. Two figures cower in the corner waiting for the approach of the half-pint horror: Dr. Nerd!</em></p><p><em>Melissa wrapped her arms tightly around her nude body, shivering in the dank garage. No matter what humiliations heâs planned, she thinks, at least he wonât take her to that freezing pool. The doctor is a disgusting toad of a man, but even HE wouldnât do that to them again, right?</em></p><p><em>Tammy threw her arms in front of her face to protect her from the fall, but hit the hard mat with a sickening thud. The shock sent bolts of pain up her arms and legs, and her breath was knocked out of her. How could he be so strong? His greasy bald head barely came up to her large breasts, and his knuckles almost scraped on the floor as he plodded along the hallways of the hospital. Suddenly he had the vicious strength of some inhuman monster as he tossed her around like a doll. Before she understood what was happening, her wrists were bound by thick ropes and a heavy coil slid over her neck.</em></p><p><em>She tried to cry out in terror but was yanked spread-eagle before him. He was a midget but he towered over her as she struggled helplessly at his feet. âBad girl,â he chuckled. âAll my girls have to learn to crawl before me. From now on youâll never take another step like a normal woman. Youâll crawl before me like a bitch in heat!â</em></p><p><em>The tranquilizer dart punched into Melissaâs breast and she doubled over in pain. Another dart whistled past her head as she fell to the grassy field. They were shooting again! She saw the edge of the forest and forced her nude body to start running.</em></p><p><em>Her firm, long legs moved unsteadily beneath her and she shook her head to clear the fog which sprung up behind her eyes. The flesh on her back crawled as if she could feel the crosshairs center on her spine as she lunged towards the safety of the forest. She had to get out of there, she thought. Sheâd been through so much, survived degradations which left her whimpering in humiliation every night. But it would be for nothing if they caught her in the open and dragged her back to the lodge. She heard menâs laughter behind her, growing louder. As she gasped for air she heard the distinct click of a gun being cocked and another dart being loaded into the chamber of the rifleâ¦</em></p><p><em>A dripping trail of slime ran down her thighs and pooled on the concrete floor. Tammy thought she had wet herself until she realized what it was. It was evidence of that demonic runt, a sign that she belonged to him now. There was nothing he couldnât make her do, and he proved it again and again. She slammed her eyes shut and rocked back on her heels as the filthy slime oozed from her once virginal slit...</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Life in Russia can be dreary and boring. Although the nation was certainly becoming more upscale and prosperous, these girls dreamed of something more, of something better than merely being arm candy to a fat and corrupt Russian oil baron or government bureaucrat in a cold, dead wasteland.</em></p><p><em>Natasha dreamed of glory, fame, fortune, and the beaches of California! Oooh, the boys looked soooo dreamy over the television.</em></p><p><em>But how to get there?</em></p><p><em>It didn't take long for Natasha to get a bright idea: she'd become a Russian bride!</em></p><p><em>Those dating sites were everywhere on the Internet, and it'd be MUCH easier for her to find some stupid, American loser.</em></p><p><em>She'd just find some fat, desperate slob who wanted a beautiful, Russian bride. He'd pay for everything, and once she got there and became married, she'd dump and divorce him before the day was over, much less before he got any bright ideas.</em></p><p><em>It seemed like the perfect plan. What could possibly go wrong?</em></p><p><em>Quite a lot, in fact!</em></p><p><em>Natasha will get a quick lesson that nothing in life comes easy, and she'll soon learn that if you want to play someone for a sucker, you'd better be careful not to become a sucker yourself.</em></p><p><em>Things start to get crazy almost from the moment she touches down. She's starting to get a bad feeling about this, but it's too late to turn back now.</em></p><p><em>She gets into a car with a complete stranger, claiming that her \"husband\" is busy, and the drive is a lot longer and further out than she'd ever imagined.</em></p><p><em>And Natasha sees things, things that will come to haunt her very, very soon. And she'll learn that the Internet is as much a weapon in another person's hands as it was in her own.</em></p><p><em>\"Heh, stupid commie! I bet you never heard of Yoogle search!\"</em></p><p><em>Life beco mes a vicious, hellish cycle for Natasha, a constant regimen of humiliation, abuse, and sexual slavery!</em></p><p><em>\"Tell me you like it, you Bolshevik bimbo, or I might have to institute a purge!\"</em></p><p><em>She'll learn that, no matter how bad life seemed in Russia, there were places that were much, much worse!</em></p><p><em>\"It seems this little Red sympathizer is a party loyalist. Maybe we gotta reeducate her, eh?\"</em></p><p><em>\"We'd better plug up her Red hole. Don't want no propaganda leaking out!\"</em></p><p><em>And things only get worse.</em></p><p><em>Her captors find out she has a friend, a pretty, blonde friend just as tight and sexy as she is. Maybe it's time for an International Summit, eh Russkie?</em></p><p> </p>",

Safe at last, they think!</em></p><p><em>But they are quite wrong...</em></p><p><em>The remote castle is inhabited by a sinister Countess and her threatening, malformed, twisted servants.</em></p><p><em>The Countess spikes the girls' drinks and they wake up to find themselves chained and naked in a sinister medieval dungeon. The place is full of old, menacing punishment devices dating from the days of the Spanish Inquisition...</em></p><p><em>With a leering grin on her face, the Countess tells the horrified girls that she is a very hot woman but she has never been able to achieve orgasm. Her only chance of having her first climax is through group sex with other women, she has decided. Watching how other women reach climax will perhaps make it possible for her to do the same. And if the women are subjected to cruel and painful abuse, then her own chances will be even better!</em></p><p><em>In other words, the infamous Countess is a cruel, kinky lesbian.</em></p><p><em>The girls are thoroughly humiliated and punished by the Countess and her sick staff. Their only offence is that they are young, beautiful, and can have orgasms.</em></p><p><em>The desperate captive girls are made to suffer the most intimate physical humiliaiton, witnessing each other's terrible plight.</em></p><p><em>Theyâre locked in a place that is out of this world and out of this time, naked prisoners in a forgotten medieval dungeon...</em></p><p><em>No light, no fresh air, no clothesâ¦ just damp, rats, horror, pain and abuse at the hands of their sinister guardians. And all for the sake of the Countess's sexual satisfaction...</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Sandy was on cloud nine! She just turned 18 and Jonathan, the dreamy captain of the football team had just asked her out! Life couldn't get any better! He was the boss, a perfect gentleman, not at all the kind of screwed up perv all her friends insisted he was. How could such a handsome, perfect man be so bad, anyway?</em></p><p><em>After the movie, Jonathan drove them to a lookout above the city. The sunset was so romantic. If this was a dream, Sandy never wanted to wake up.</em></p><p><em>Sandy sat up in her chair as she looked out towards the city. Jonathan, however, looked at Sandy's sweet tits. He leaned in closer and wrapped an arm around her. Then he slipped a hand under her skirt...</em><br /><em> \"Jonathan? What are you doing?\"</em></p><p><em>Boy was she mad! Once in the back seat of his hotrod, her prince charming turned into a horny toad! How did her cool cat turn into a brute? Her magical dream was quickly turning into a nightmare!</em></p><p><em>She wished it was a nightmare... at least then she would wake up!</em></p><p><em> \"I knew youâd chicken out on me! You cockteasing little tramp! No chick</em><br /><em> makes a fool of Johnny, do you hear me? Nobody! I even stole some</em><br /><em> rubbers from my old man and dammit, Iâm going to use them!\"</em></p><p><em>But even in her darkest dreams, she didn't expect what was going to happen next...</em></p><p><em> \"Sounds like the little lady wants her dance card punched by someone else, boy-o! Why donât you take a hike?\" \"Lemmie guess. Goodie two-shoes gets wet for cock but is two shy to spread her gams and beg to be fucked. Is that your problem?\" \"Let's do it slasher style, babe! That means bent over and beaten like a red-headed stepchild!\"</em></p><p><em>Just when she started to think the nightmare is over, it takes a turn for the worse... much, much worse.</em></p><p><em>Sandy stops the first car that crosses her way, and she's filled with relief. Finally! She's safe, and she can go home and forget everything that happened! Boy, did she feel dirty. She couldn't wait to wash out all her holes. And what would mommy say? Maybe she'd help her out...</em></p><p><em>A man gets out of the car, and he has a terrifying leer on his face. Sandy didn't know it then, but she couldn't have picked a worse car to pull over. The man wasn't going to help her. In fact, he was the worst kind of man around, the kind that would make those goofy greasers look like genuine gentlemen! He was a white slaver, and he just struck gold!</em></p><p><em>Sandy was stripped naked, gagged, and chained in a dog's kennel with two other frightened girls. The man is even worse that she could've possibly imagined or feared. Mean and cruel with a taste for fine, far out, female flesh, he's not above taking a taste of the latest cunts he's just collected...</em></p><p><em> \"Now you mongrels play nicely. If I hear any barking from you,</em><br /><em> and Iâll beat your tails black and blue!\"</em></p><p><em>But every good slave worth her holes needs to be sold. The white slaver offers them to an ugly, filthy, dirty man. The man is dark, twisted, and eager to take out his nasty, sadistic, cruel fantasies on the helpless bound beauties on display before him. There's nothing like young, fresh, unmarked girls to satisfy his undeniable cravings. The man isn't just filthy; he's filthy rich! He knows what he wants, and he has the money to get it!</em></p><p><em> \"Iâm looking for firm titmeat. Something that a man of my position can really sink his teeth into.\"</em></p><p><em>The man takes a look at Sandy, and his eyes light up. He knows what he wants, and he wants her!</em></p><p><em>Sandy descends into a living hell of humiliation and terror! This man is a complete and utter psychopath, a vicious criminal who isn't afraid to use violence to get what he wants, a criminally insane man with no regard for the coppers or the law, never mind simple decency or human safety.</em></p>",

Although theyâd been acquitted by a corrupt judge, the townsfolk decided to hang the lot of themâ¦ legend had it that their ghosts still haunted its decrepit walls.</em></p><p><em>These young girls decided to spend the night in the haunted Bergenson mansionâ¦ and they found out that the legends were trueâ¦ much to their despair!</em></p><p><em>Cecil and Evans Bergenson, the sons of the family, continue their perverted spree of flesh fucking and cunt busting from beyond the grave, with poor Danni and Trixie on the receiving end! The ghosts sate their age old lusts on young, nubile, female flesh!</em></p><p><em>But things get worse for the girlsâ¦ much, much worseâ¦ when the boysâ cruel and vicious, old world father, finds the girls. Old Jaeger Bergenson has very outdated ideas about how âproperâ women should behave, and heâs not shy about using more primal, more barbaric methods to instill discipline in a lusty, wayward generationâ¦</em></p><p><em>One thing is clearâ¦ the girls are to receive their due punishment for flashing their bits in publicâ¦ whether they survive is another matter!</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>Several months ago, a police report had been filed regarding the disappearance of two young girls, a Madison and Megan, who were last seen on a bike ride through a remote wilderness in old Appalachia. Nothing had been found of the girls, and they were presumed to have been runaways who did not wish to be caught. Officer Sullivan attempted to interview the locals who lived in the area. None of them had seen anyone matching the description of Megan or Madison, and they seemed quite hostile to Officer Sullivanâs questions. Some even insinuated that terrible things would be done to any âoutsidersâ who were caught in the âhills.â</p><p>Some wild stories were mentioned about pretty young girls being caught, used, and abused physically and sexually by some distant, mutant, inbred hillbillies deep in the Appalachian wilderness. It was stated that these mutant inbreeds would take the girls and fuck them over and over and over again in an attempt to âcontinue the line.â It was insinuated that these mutant inbreeds would attempt to impregnate the girls and fill them with their foul, mutant seed. The girls would take the blame for anything that went wrong and would be punished severely.</p><p>Even escape attempts were stated to be futile, as these mutant inbreeds would know the local area quite well.</p><p>Officer Sullivan was again dispatched to the local area in response to another missing persons report regarding a Vivian, Kim, and Holly. The locals whom the officer had interviewed before were just as unfriendly as before, if not more so. One particular interviewee seemed particularly suspicious, stating that the âcleanâ girls would be used to âcontinue the lineâ whereas the other ones, the unfit ones, would be either cast aside to some kind of disgusting, doglike creature barely a man at all, to be used sexually over and over and over againâ¦</p><p>And worse was implied still, that the girls who continued to disappoint might meet an even crueler fate...</p><p>None of the missing persons who were reported have been found. As the supervising officer, I strongly recommended that we close the case. There is no reason to suspect that any of the persons reported (Megan, Madison, Vivian, Kim, or Holly) are in the area, and police resources would be better used in other methods.</p><p>Though I would shudder to think what might happen to those girls if they were in the clutches of some kind of mutant, inbred, abominationâ¦</p>",

Wrongly convicted of serious crimes, they are sentenced to the Lost Girls Reform School. Powerless against the staff and guards, the girls can only obey as they are marched into the wicked school...</em></p><p><em>The schoolâs Slave Trainer is a demented thug who thoroughly enjoys using the inmateâs bodies to satisfy his every sick desires.</em></p><p><em>The new girls are brought to the schoolâs medical center where they are giving a shameful examination. Fully naked and on display, nothing is hidden from the doctorâs eyes and hands. Claiming heâs examining them for smuggled narcotics, the doctor uses this excuse to probe deeply into every area of the girls bodies.</em></p><p><em>Mortified by their treatment and shameful experience, the girls are presented to the director of the school for enrollment. The Headmaster is an old, lecherous man who sees the new girls as nothing more than an outlet for his lusts, before he gets rich selling them on the Slave Market.</em></p><p><em>Using his position of authority, the Headmaster plants drugs on Vicki and accuses her of smuggling them into the school! Gleefully entrapping the poor women in another crime, he wastes no time in breaking down their resistance to his will. Fearing his power and cruelty, Kelli tries to comply with his sick demands expecting a small fragment of mercy, she finds none...</em></p><p><em>Both girls are taken by a butch lesbian guard to be washed and clothed in the schoolâs uniform. The uniform is nothing more than a low-cut top, showing plenty of cleavage and ending right above the hips. With their pussies on display to the staff, the bull-dyke helps herself to their unwilling bodies.</em></p><p><em>The classes are merciless prisons, where schoolgirls are taught how to please their future Masters in every way imaginable....</em></p><p><em>Tammi, a lovely redhead, is singled out for a lesson in abuse. Futilely struggling against the teacher, she is taken by the powerful Slave Trainer who handles her like a toy, a mere plaything to his perverted lust.</em></p><p><em>Far below the classrooms, Tammi is reunited in the schoolâs training dungeons with her sister. Chained and helpless, the sister can only watch as the Slave Trainer breaks Tammi in every disgusting way imaginable. Unable to save her sister, the torment is horrific.</em></p><p><em>As the day for the Slave Auction arrives, the new girls are subjected to more severe training by the perverted staff...</em></p><p><em>The Slave Auction begins, and five girls have âgraduatedâ from the Reformatory to the Auction, Kelly and Vicky among them. Wealthy men and women from across the world have arrived for the opportunity to buy a beautiful white girl to play in whatever way they see fit.</em></p><p><em>Determined to use the girls in their darkest most violent sex fantasies, the bidding is intense...</em></p><p><em>One by one, the girls are sold off, all traces of dignity and self-respect gone. Knowing that resistance will be met with instant punishment, they submit to the most disgusting games imaginable. Thoughts of escape taunt them and add to their misery.</em></p><p><em>Once sold, the girls become property of their new Masters for the rest of their miserable lives. The ruthless owners quickly take charge of their new possessions!</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Sabrina and Ginger are more than two college roommates on vacation. The sexy young women became friends and then lovers when they moved in together during their first semester. Since then, the high-spirited sophomores have been inseparable.</em></p><p><em>When Ginger was contacted from a long-lost uncle living in Mexico through Fakebook, she quickly arranged a reunion and invited her lover along.</em></p><p><em>What better way to enjoy the warm sands of the Mexican beaches than in the arms of her busty blonde girlfriend?</em></p><p><em>Sabrina held Ginger lovingly, caressing her back and arms as they stood in line at the airport. When the people around her gasped in surprise she held her girlfriend closer, cupping the redheadâs firm breasts and sliding her hand over her sexy hips.</em></p><p><em>She nibbled on Gingerâs ear, and snickered at the whispered comments around her. Mexico has got to be more open minded than the States! Sure, sheâd never been over the border, but Mexico thrives on tourism. Surely theyâve seen it all before, and kissing her lover in public wouldnât cause such a fuss!</em></p><p><em>The adobe walls of the grimy police station didnât look promising. Ginger was kicking herself for getting them in such a mess. How could she have been so dumb?</em></p><p><em>Their host didnât meet them at the bus station, and the village wouldnât have cell phone reception for another decade at least!</em></p><p><em>She looked at the building again, and her shoulders lowered in resignation. The locals said the police station would have a phone they could use, but the place looked almost abandoned.</em></p><p><em>Grabbing her heavy suitcase, the pert young woman walked towards the door. Well, she thought, whatâs the harm in trying? The worst that could happen was they could turn her down and send her and her girlfriend on their way.</em></p><p><em>The police officerâs uniform was stained with sweat and tobacco juice, and the man inside was even more slovenly. His hairy arms pinned Gingerâs hands above her head, while his partner grabbed her body possessively. She opened her mouth to scream but a swift backhand across her cheeks made her bite her tongue instead. Blood filled her mouth, and stars flickered before her jade green eyes. The men were ripping off her clothes, and she couldnât stop them!</em></p><p><em>From far away she heard the screams of her girlfriend calling for help. Her heart froze in her chest. Sheâd never been with a man before, but the bulges in the police trousers told her that was about to change!</em></p><p><em>Sabrinaâs arms ached with the pain of trying to support her weight. Sheâd been chained to the ceiling of the musty cell in the police station and could do nothing but try to keep her balance. Her legs throbbed with agony as she tried to stay on her feet. Ginger huddled before her, staring with misery at the fat cop whoâd kicked her.</em></p><p><em>âOn your knees, pet,â he growled. âYou come to Mexico flaunting your immoral ways and donât expect to pay the price? Youâre gonna learn how we do things here, and we donât tolerate slow learners!â</em></p><p><em>He scratched his crotch and advanced on the poor young woman.</em></p><p><em>âIâm gonna train you real good in how to please a man, and your girlfriend is gonna watch!â</em></p>",

Interceptor holds many of the last pirates below decks bound for England. These men will get a speedy trial and a public hanging.</em></p><p><em>Two women are along for the voyage, Lady Vanessa Reisenfel and Lady Nancy Drake.</em></p><p><em>One, Vanessa, sails for love. Captain Randall Spears and Lady Vanessa Reisenfel are to be married upon their return to England. But fate has other plans as strong wind and full sails speed the H.M.S. Interceptor toward home.</em></p><p><em>The other woman, Lady Drake, sails for revenge. Her parents were assaulted and killed by the same pirates now held prisoners in the galley. Ragged Lady Drake visits them and verbally and physically abuses the criminal pirates on their way to a dismal fate in England.</em></p><p><em>Suddenly all thought of love or hate and revenge are forgotten when a dark sail is spotted on the horizon. Pirate William Morgan's ship is approaching!</em></p><p><em>The assault is imminent...</em></p><p><em>As the battle rages and the cannons fire a broadside, a boarding party of cut-throat pirates swing across onto the Zephyr and begin to dispatch the crew.</em></p><p><em>The promise of fresh young women drives them into a frenzy...</em></p><p><em>Many pay with their lives but the battle wages ill for the redcoats aboard the Interceptor. One shot apiece and no time to reload!</em></p><p><em>Then hand to hand as the pirates close in upon them. Cold steel rings out against flesh. Pistols find their mark as many a brave man falls.</em></p><p><em>Soon the deck is smeared red with the blood of pirates and patriots alike.</em></p><p><em>One by one the crew of the Zephyr are dispatched or captured.</em></p><p><em>The pirate William Morgan is in firm control of both ships.</em></p><p><em>Nancy Drake never makes it below decks. She's been captured, strung up and put on display for Captain Morgan's inspection. The bound officers can only watch as the woman meets her fate at the hands of a new captain and crew.</em></p><p><em>Nancy wails as her dress is torn open.</em></p><p><em>The pirates laugh and point as her firm proud breasts spring free of the modest clothing that soon lays in tatters around her feet.</em></p><p><em>Soon her words turn to screams as the lash rains down across her pale flesh. Some laugh, others drool as they watch her wriggle and writhe under the vicious ministrations of the leather crop.</em></p><p><em>To Nancy's dismay, the more she struggles, the lower her dress fall exposing more of her soft creamy flesh to the lash.</em></p><p><em>After a thorough search of the ship, the pirates find Vanessa and Randall hiding in a packing crate.</em></p><p><em>They waste no time in introducing them to the captain. Dragged by her hair, Vanessa feels her beautiful dress being torn from her body. Screaming and struggling is useless and dangerous, it only fuels the pirate's lust to watch her twist and buck as they strip and grope their new prisoner.</em></p><p><em>Tears flows at the humiliation of her situation. Soon she's completely naked. Captain Morgan laughs as his men strip her and string her up.</em></p><p> </p>",

Looking up, they see their cousin Beatrice. The girl is locked in a tiny cage suspended from the tower. She has been sentenced to a horrendous public death by starvation for rejecting the lustful advances of the much older Duke of Valois...</p><p>The now terrified girls are chained up in a cold, wet dungeon. They were noblewomen only a week ago, and now they are the captives of their hated enemy, at the mercy of the groping hands and sneering comments of the dungeon guards...</p><p>Next day, the Duke of Valois and his noblemen hold a party to celebrate victory. The female attendants are the defenseless captives taken in the attack on the rival castle. Nieces of the Duke of Villiers, guests, servants... The orgy is heaven on earth for the victors and a hell of shame for the unfortunate young prisoners.</p><p>But the Duke is far from being fully satisfied. Yes, he has defeated his hated rival and has seized all his properties and enslaved the women, but the Duke's beautiful young daughters were never found...</p><p>Suddenly, to the infamous Duke's surprise and delight, news arrives that the Villiers sisters have finally been captured.

The Duchess, a sadistic lesbian, joins in...</p><p>After weeks of continuous humiliation and abuse, the two sisters are the stars of the Victory Day celebrations...</p><p>Everybody in the region, nobles and peasants alike, attend the event accompanied by naked slavegirls seized in the Villiers' Castle...</p><p>To the further humiliation of the young sisters, they are the prizes in an obscene lottery.</p><p>Two happy, excited winners take possession of their hot prizes ...</p><p>The plight of the once admired noblewomen is now even more desperate... The peasants who own them hate all nobles, but hate this family in particular. The girls are going to pay dearly for their noble status, for their good looks and for being who they are...</p><p> </p>",

Well, we finally have enough evidence to nail his ass! 'Big Joe' has been attacking young, rich white girls, abusing them and turning them into prostitutes for too long. He's always managed to avoid arrest so far. But now we have the bastard!â</em></p><p><em>Lt. Samantha Long looked around at the men and women in her team. Her eyes lingered for a moment on the lovely Veronica, who was sitting quietly in the back row. Her heart skipped a beat. She was on duty and should be all business, but she couldn't help remembering how Veronica had looked, naked and warm and welcoming, in her big bed the night before...</em></p><p><em>She shook off all thoughts of her lover and returned to the business in hand. âTonight we go in and break the son-of-a-bitch. No mistakes this time, everything has to be done by the book. We have the warrants, the DA is waiting to charge the gang and I know you'll all do a good job. So letâs do it.â</em></p><p><em>That night, Samantha and Veronica catch the two thugs red-handed, abusing one of their victims.</em></p><p><em>Big Joe and his fellow thug threaten the young officers... \"Fuck you, butch! No cunt cop is ever going to take me in!\"</em></p><p><em>The trial proved a disappointment for the two inexperienced officers... \"Due to the alleged victimâs failure to press charges, and in the light of the overwhelming evidence of police brutality, this court has no option but to dismiss the case.\"</em></p><p><em>In court, Big Joe threatens the girls... \"Your cunts are mine, bitches! Iâll be back for them when youâre least expecting me.â</em></p><p><em>The press and their superior officers blame the girls for the failure...</em></p><p><em>As promised by Big Joe, a week later, Samantha and Veronica are the naked, bound captives of the two dangerous thugs...</em></p><p><em>Payback is dreadful... relentless... and ruthless!</em></p><p><em>It's hell on earth for the trapped girls...</em></p><p><em>The two bastards vent all their hatred and sick lust on the now defenseless female officers...</em></p><p><em>Big Joe has big plans for his two young beauties. He's a pimp and heâs more than happy to add the gorgeous white chicks to his stable....</em></p><p><em>Nobody will ever find them where they are being held and nobody seems to care too much either. The two young feminist officers were just a problem for their fellow cops and Big Joe knows it...</em> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Chrissi is a sexy, bright student who leaves her small town life behind to pursue her future. But her sheltered life has left her unprepared against the harsh cruelties of the world.</em></p><p><em>Living a secluded existence, the young student is oblivious to the dangers around her as she hitches a ride into town to start her first day of college classes, and her new life. When a sinister truck pulls up to offer her a lift, she unthinkingly climbs in.</em></p><p><em>With little past experience with meeting strangers, she is startled by the driverâs menacing appearance but undeterred....</em></p><p><em>Against better judgment, she stays in the cab as it turns off the highway and onto a rutted road winding through the countryside.</em></p><p><em>Trapped in the sinister truck, Chrissi is rendered helpless when a sudden, brutal assault by the driver pins her in the seat, and seals off any chance at escape. Transformed by lust and savagery, the driver gloats over his nubile prize...</em></p><p><em>Heart pounding with terror, the young woman can only plead with the driver as he begins his conquest of her body and dignity. Not used to the depths men will sink to in the throes of lust, she is sickened by his demands, and the rough treatment inflicted on her tender flesh.</em></p><p><em>Awaking in the back of the dilapidated truck, horrified by what she's experienced... Chrissi is more determined than ever to escape.</em></p><p><em>Her mind still reeling from the cruelty she's endured, Chrissi is horribly aware of how unprepared she is to be on her own, away from the safety of her house and family. Inside the rotted dwelling, she finally understands the depths of the driverâs sick fascination with the total domination and humiliation of women.</em></p><p><em>Aware that she is nothing more than just another mindless doll to the brutal hick, Chrissi desperately tries to escape the stinking, filthy figure towering over her. Cowering in terror, she pleads with her captor futility as his lust grows.</em></p><p><em>Not satisfied with only the physical domination of the young woman, the loathsome hillbilly plans to add Chrissi to his farm as a breeding sow, to produce his twisted offspring....</em></p><p><em>Shaken and exhausted by endless nightmares, Chrissi awakes in the filth to meet the other members of the depraved family nesting in the wood....</em></p><p><em>The unnatural family is centered around Mommas cruel ogre of a woman whose violent lusts are only satisfied through repulsive humiliation and degradation of the most primal sort.</em></p><p><em>Feeling and unendurable shame at the acts she's participated in, the young girl leaps at her once chance to flee the nightmare of the crumbling hell-house hidden in the woods. But the long confinement has weakened her body, and left her vulnerable to the hicks inhabiting the woods, who know far more about its ways than a young girl out on her own for the first time. A momentâs inattention dashes her plans... and brings her face to face with Momma's unleashed wrath...</em></p><p><em>Broken almost to the core, Chrissi's hell has just begun. The enraged driver hauls the terrified girl back to the ghastly shack to present her to the rest of the family, and delivers a strong warning about any thoughts of disobedience...</em></p><p><em>Fearing for more than the loss of her purity and dignity, Chrissi struggles to hold onto her very sanity as she's participates in the most vile and loathsome acts of perversion with the family's figurehead: Grandpappy. The wizened fossil is only too eager to debase the young woman and use her for his ancient lusts. Her will failing, and body abused and exhausted, Chrissi knows she must act soon or be trapped with the degenerate family forever!</em></p><p><em> </em></p>",

The prison walls echo with the cries from other prisoners, but give no answers to the fear-maddened young woman.</em></p><p><em>Colonel Wasp doesnât limit her cruelty to men, but glorifies in the power she holds over her shipment of female captives.</em></p><p><em>Whether they are actually guilty of the crimes theyâve been accused of is of no importance to her.</em></p><p><em>What matters is that they provide her with feminine entertainment for the long journey to the Martian Penal Colony.</em></p><p><em>As the delivery ship blazes towards Mars, Mad Satan sits in the middle of the colony awaiting their arrival like a fat spider in a steel web.</em></p><p><em>His last shipment of sexy captives didnât last long, and if the new young inmates donât satisfy his cravings, there will be hell to pay!</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>An island of steel and iron rises out of the Caribbean Sea . The Platform is an isolated world on the water. Its crew seethes with pent-up frustration, until a sexy, young woman arrives and faces the full force of their hunger for âentertainmentâ!</em></p><p><em>Caroline Collins has never been on an oil platform before, or worked with such rough men! Everything sheâs learned before arriving at The Platform will be useless in her sudden fight to get back home!</em></p><p><em>The âDeep Crack Drillerâ is an engineering marvel. An impressive monument to manâs mastery over nature. The oil platform is able to withstand anything that nature can throw against her steel walls. But living within this city on the see, a group of men practice their own mastery over the rigâs newest resident.</em></p><p><em>Caroline Collins has taken her first step on the solid deck of the oil platform. Itâs not a step sheâs taken willingly, but out of necessity. As a recent college grad, she expected that good jobs would be hard to find. But finding a job as an inexperienced geologist proves to be next to impossible. When she sees a job opening on the offshore driller, she jumps at the opportunity.</em></p><p><em>She thinks she can handle the hardship, hard work and isolation. But when she meets the rough crew she begins to have second thoughts.</em></p><p><em>Mr. Redondo has been working in the oil industry for all of his life. His years of drilling in the relentless Texas heat have made him a man to be feared. The punishing work has turned his body into a pillar of knotted muscle and wire sinews. He has little respect for the men working on his crew. For women, he has none. Especially for the bright, perky college graduates like Caroline!</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Redondo runs his oil platform like his own private kingdom. Anchored deep within the Caribbean Sea , the platform is out of reach from government oversight and the laws of civilization. Redondo has carefully selected his crew on the monolithic structure. Men who only understand brute force, and only one law: survival of the fittest!</em></p><p> </p><p><em>When Caroline steps onto the Deep Crack Driller as its new geologist, she might not ever step off it again. Women on the intimidating platform have a bad habit of falling prey to industrial accidents in the dangerous environment. They simply vanish, with only the hulking crew of the rig knowing the full story behind their sudden disappearance!</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Caroline feels desolated when she first enter the common area of the Platform, her home for the next year. The place reeks to putrid fish and sweat. Dirty is everywhere. And what's worse, on the big plasma screen a bondage movie is showing. A gagged, naked girl is being branded in a horrible scene. The screams of the unfortunate fill the creepy room making speech impossible.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Being alone for over 50 years can push anyone over the edge, especially someone with a dark secret like Bernie. Heâs a foot loving fetishist whoâs been unable to indulge in his lust for beautiful womenâs feet strapped in sexy, slutty shoes.</em></p><p><em>His obsession boils over into mania when he meets the busty blonde saleswoman at his favorite shoe store.</em></p><p><em>Sheâs got everything heâs ever wanted in a plaything! No more than twenty, a full mouth with pouty lips, a huge rack, narrow waist, tight firm ass and stunningly beautiful.</em></p><p><em>But most importantly, sheâs got a heavenly pair of legs perfect for jerking off onto...</em></p><p><em>Old Bernieâs got to get her alone if he stands a chance of making his perverse fantasies come true!</em></p><p><em>I knew she was doing it on purpose! Showing off her tight ass in clothes only a slut would wear! She must have known that Iâd been watching her from the store window. Iâd seen her strutting around the aisles of come-fuck-me pumps and ladies boots, bending over to straighten the rows of leather flats causing my pants to bulge in longing.</em></p><p><em>She pretended not to see me, treated me like I was invisible. Hell, as far as she cared I didnât even exist. I was three times her age and am an overweight slob. Thinking that a loser like me would have a chance with a babe like that is a sick joke.</em></p><p><em>Her sexy legs could have walked themselves off the pages of my favorite porno magazine. Hot damn! I thought she had a killer body when I spied on her from my vanâ¦ took those candid photos while she worked out at the park or walked to workâ¦ but that was nothing to seeing her whimpering at my feet bare-ass naked. Her toes curled in fright as I leaned over her, my hairy crotch only inches from her face.</em></p><p><em>âYou liked tempting me before, eh? Thought I was too much of a pathetic worm to speak to you, let along ask you on a date. Stupid bitch! What do you think of me NOW?!!â</em></p><p> </p>",

So it seemed like fate when they fell in love with each otherâs brothers. Carla fell in love with Jessicaâs brother, Brian, the star quarterback of the college football team. And Jessica fell in love with Carlaâs brother, Peter, the quiet philosophy major with the sensitive brown eyes. They had a joint marriage ceremony, with Peter and Jessica, Carla and Brian, sharing in their joy.</em></p><p><em>Of course being poor college students, they had to do their honeymoon on the cheap, but what better way to celebrate their new romances then by visiting the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec, Canada? Nothing but a pair of tents, some food, the wilderness, and their love for each otherâ¦</em></p><p><em>And the meth smuggling poachers that use the woods as their hideawayâ¦</em></p><p><em>The poachers quickly decide to have some fun with the fresh meat that has stumbled into their hunting grounds, forcing the siblings to pair off and fuck each other in a humiliating display of incest while the poachers laugh at their shame.

Honor demands vengeance, but now Li is plunged into a fight with no rules, and everything to lose!</em></p><p><em>When China was ruled by brute strength, the strongest survive. Only those skilled in warfare could rise to power, and their rule lasted only as long as they could hold their sword to their enemyâs throats.</em></p><p><em>In this fiery caldron of war, only the most elite fighters were trusted enough to be bodyguards.

And Li HongJiao is about to see how quickly General WangLun changes from a simple-minded thug, to an inhuman brute!</em></p><p><em>Action doesnât get any hotter than this! Only the exotic setting of ancient China could contain such a story of breathtaking beauty, and mindless savagery! Every page explodes with hot action!</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Powerful men in the government are funding the most gruesome experiments ever known to science, all directed by the shadowy Dr. Horace Bone.</em></p><p><em>Countries across the globe have been trying to get their hands on him for decades, be the twisted genius has always managed to escape right before they can close the net. The doctor leaves behind chilling evidence of his work, frightening machines and a trail of broken bodies and minds.</em></p><p><em>The women who are unlucky enough to find themselves strapped to his examination table are never the same.</em></p><p><em>Agent Kitty lunged at the wiry form draped in a blood-spattered lab coat.</em></p><p><em>Her mind raced as he cowered in fear. He was trapped! All of her training for this mission was finally coming together.</em></p><p><em>She knew that the doctor seemed unstoppable, always managing to vanish as though protected by some dark force. Adrenaline coursed through her veins and her legs pumped as she closed in on him. This time would be different. This time the madman would face justice! He would either rot in prison, or end his life twitching on the slippery floor of his barbaric operating room!</em></p><p><em>The rusty chains snapped shut on her wrists, the pitted metal scraping her smooth skin. She cried out as her arms were yanked wide. She couldnât move!</em></p><p><em>She knew her mistake, sheâd let them see how dangerous she was. Although most men thought the buxom young woman was a knockout, few understood that she could become a furious killing machine as well.</em></p><p><em>Her shoulders strained as the chains were pulled even tighter, lifting her feet from the gore-smeared floor. They wouldnât give her a chance to escape. Theyâd make sure she was in no shape to offer any resistance when they finally unlocked the cuffs. A gasp of horror lodged in her throat as she saw the guards pick up the heavy whips and step forwardâ¦</em></p><p><em>Dr. Bone ran his tongue over the broken tooth, wincing in sudden pain. Sheâd pay for that!</em></p><p><em>He didnât mind the bruises that covered his face or the blood which flowed down his chin. Bodies are weak things, he thought. Iâm a doctor, I should know! But Iâll never stand for a woman daring to touch meâ¦ acting as though she has the right to shout orders or think without permission.</em></p><p><em>Oh this one was a hellcat, all right. Tough and beautiful with muscles as hard as steel. Just the subject Iâve been looking for!</em></p><p><em>He flipped the switch on the machine before him and grinned at the cackling hum of electricity which flowed from it.</em></p><p><em>A terrifying buzzing filled the air and the floor shook from the machines power. She may be strong, he thought, but even steel can be twisted into any form I choose!</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Dr. Horace Bone received funding from Beijing to conduct experiments. If his research bore fruit, the government would be able to control its citizens with absolute certainty.</em></p><p><em>However, Dr. Bone had another agenda on his mind, a special project that the government would never find out: he wanted to control not just people, but the most beautiful, most gorgeous, most proud and arrogant women and bend and break them to his will!</em></p><p><em>If he could do that, then the entire world would be under his control! Half of the human race would live to serve him, and the other half would be too busy fucking to stop him!</em></p><p><em>It was the perfect plan.</em></p><p><em>S.L.U.T. had their best, Agent Kitty, to stop Dr. Horace Bone and make sure his research never came to fruition. She failed in her task, and now she's caught in his evil clutches. She was stronger than his other test subjects, but she too would soon succumb to his devious expertise.</em></p><p><em>S.L.U.T., worried about Agent Kitty, quickly dispatched Agent Amber and Agent Blondie to find out what happened to Agent Kitty and, if necessary, put a stop to Dr. Bone's wicked ways.</em></p><p><em>The girls quickly penetrate into Dr. Bone's dank, dark lair and they find Agent Kitty, being abused and brainwashed! They try to stop the sick Horace Bone but they are no match for his brilliant mind.</em></p><p><em>He had been waiting for them all along, and he'd already devised the most perfect plan to bend them to his will while slowly breaking down their resistance.</em></p><p><em>He enjoyed toying with his test subjects. The best part of the game was watching them squirm, thrash, and fight. He enjoyed listening to them scream and curse his name and swear all kinds of violence and brutality against him.</em></p><p><em>He enjoyed it because he knew they would shout empty words. It was just like when he was a little kid, and he'd rip off all the legs of an ant and watch it wriggle in the dirt before him. This time, though, it wasn't some useless insect, but a proud, arrogant, and stubborn woman who thought she knew better. That made it much more delicious. That made it much more amazing!</em></p><p><em>He toys with these girls just as carefully as when he was a child. He doesn't merely rip off all the legs at once. No, Dr. Horace Bone has learned the art of pain and humiliation. He knows to take it slow: the better to prolong the agony, the shame, and his own sinister, abominable pleasure at breaking women and forcing them to serve their masters, men!</em></p><p><em>His art as a surgeon is unmatched, and that does not bode well for our helpless heroines!</em></p><p><em>Agent Amber and Agent Blondie were sent here to rescue Agent Kitty and stop Dr. Horace Bone. But they didn't know what a dangerous foe he was. Soon, Agent Amber and Agent Blondie will need rescuing themselves, but there will be no one to save them as Dr. Horace Bone breaks out his tools and his most devious device to date!</em></p><p><em>What will happen to poor Agent Amber and poor Agent Blondie? Only the sickest, most twisted, most disgusting thing imaginable! This is just the beginning of their descent into Hell. The doctor has arrived, and he's ready to operate!</em></p><p><em>Agent Amber and Agent Blondie are certainly in for a shocker! Dr. Horace Bone doesn't play around when it comes to his fresh-faced, female victims. He wants to show them the meaning of pain and agony! When he's done with Agent Amber and Agent Blondie, they'll be the most obedient little fucksluts... or else!</em></p><p> </p>",

For the most part, receiving money from the taxpayer will work, but he is an expensive man with expensive tastes, and with the global economy struggling, even mad scientists must find new revenue streams.</em></p><p><em>Fortunately for Dr. Horace Bone, he has a healthy supply of something that will never go out of style: sex slaves to satisfy the most disgusting, sinister cravings of the wealthiest, most influential, and most wicked men on the planet!</em></p><p><em>Tonight is a very special night, and his own secret club has a special show for his most esteemed guests.</em></p><p><em>CEOs, government officials, and drug kingpins have flown in from all over the world for this once in a lifetime event.</em></p><p><em>Their secret, shadow nemesis, the S.L.U.T. agency, will finally receive a shocking comeuppance.</em></p><p><em>Three of their most cunning, most skilled, and best trained agents will receive a savage and cruel punishment!</em></p><p><em>The men who arrive in the club have their own personal grudges and grievances against the entire S.L.U.T. agency.

    "description": "<p><em>Pearl danced under the spotlights, the colored beams playing over her firm body as she swayed to the pulsing beat. She gripped the microphone tightly, bringing it slowly towards her full lips. She always made sure that the casino audience was under her spell, but tonight she felt something different in the electrically charged atmosphere. Tonight, theyâd get the performance of a lifetime! The tempo increased, sending a thrill up her firm legs and causing her hips to sway provocatively. Cheers erupted around her.</em></p><p><em>Most young women dream of getting to the top, but singing sensation Pearl has the looks and talent to actually make that dream come true. Sheâs been the main attraction at the luxury Yucatan Casino for over a year. All she needs is for someone in the entertainment industry to notice her and give her a break. Unfortunately for the busty singer, sheâs been noticed by the wrong sort of talent scout!</em></p><p><em>Pearlâs breath caught in her throat as the ropes dug into her ribs. She tried to steady herself, but the bonds covered almost every inch of her tanned body. Mentally cursing herself, she struggled to break free.</em></p><p><em>How could she have not seen this coming?</em></p><p><em>Sheâd heard stories of unscrupulous directors taking advantage of innocent starlets, promising them fame and fortune only to have them star in two-bit adult movies. But Victor sounded so honest and said all the right things.</em></p><p><em>How could she have known?</em></p><p><em>Burning with shame at being tricked so easily, she yanked at the ropes again, the heavy cords rubbing her wrists raw.</em></p><p><em>She didnât know who the other woman was, but could tell by the fear in her eyes that the thugs had been using her as a warm-up act, with Pearl destined to be the main attraction.</em></p><p><em>The womanâs eyes were red from crying and she stumbled across the room with faltering steps like a puppet with a few broken strings.</em></p><p><em>Pearl saw the woman was holding something like a large syringe. With a sudden shock, Pearl recognized what it was and what it was going to be used for!</em></p><p><em>Most people thought Twiggy was the brains of the gang, and Bruno was the muscle. After all, why else would a powerful man like Vincent Stave allow the Mohawk-haired punk to hang around his mansion?</em></p><p><em>Twiggy sneered, rubbing a greasy hand over the lump in his tattered leather pants. He knew Vincent didnât hire him for his smarts. He was the secret weapon the boss kept around whenever he needed a strong-willed woman tamed!</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><i>I</i><em>n Italy, during the time of the Renaissance, as great discoveries and works of art were reshaping the world into the one we know today, the height of manâs triumphs was built on top of a festering, crumbling faÃ§ade of corruption and vice.</em></p><p><em>Run by a secret organization that sought to abuse its power for the âgoodâ of humanity, the church mutated into a shadow of its former self. While sculptors carved form from the rock and painters brought light to rooftop cathedrals, while farmers tilled waving fields of grain and merchants plied the waters of sea and ocean alike, a secret shadow war was boiling and bubbling beneath the surface, threatening to spill out into the streets and burst like an ulcerated boil upon an unprepared populace.</em></p><p><em>Fighting against this secret power corrupting the heart of the church was an ancient Order of Assassins, sworn to defend and protect freedom and the weak.</em></p><p><em>Two beautiful women belonged to this order, Maria and Lina. They were very good at their work.</em></p><p><em>They became known as The Shadow of the City, and the church feared and hated them.</em></p><p><em>Unable to tolerate this blatant, unrestrained, and insolent provocation, the church sends its most competent servant as bait to draw out this âShadow of the City.â Captain of the Guard, Saul Macchione makes public appearances, masquerading as Archbishop Christophe, hoping to lure out these callous murderers and bring them to justice.</em></p><p><em>His efforts do not unrewarded.</em></p><p><em>Soon, Captain Saul Macchione has not one but two assassins in his grasp, and much to his surprise, they are stunningly beautiful women. The Archbishop will be most pleased... most pleased indeed!</em></p><p><em>Later that day, Captain Saul Macchione brings the bound and helpless beauties to be judged and tried before the Archbishop Christophe himself! The holy man listens to these rebellious, arrogant girls and quickly deems them guilty!</em></p><p><em>Their punishment is swift, sadistic, and perverse!</em></p><p><em>They do everything to humiliate and shame their beautiful captive, and they succeed!</em></p><p><em>And the Archbishop Christophe does not restrain himself from participating.</em></p><p><em>He too uses pretty Maria in ways that only the sickest and most twisted of men could possibly imagine!</em></p><p><em>These girls are clearly a threat to himself and his organization. They could not possibly be working alone. There must be someone else who hired them, who directed them, who controlled them from even deeper underground. The Archbishop Christophe pontificates about these girlsâ heresies and ignorance and their inability to comprehend the grandness of his own, divine mission. He claims that they are too short-sighted to see the grand picture, but it is all simply an excuse. Sure, he may root out the source of the assassins, and that would be great too, but it is much, much more important to break these girls of their arrogance, their rebellious spirit, and their every will to live!</em></p><p><em>Archbishop Christophe sets Captain Saul Macchione to the task.</em></p><p><em>It is a task that the captain will take to with GREAT relish!</em></p><p><em>Deep in the catacombs beneath Rome, Captain Saul Macchione strips the girls of their remaining dignity and marches them deeper and deeper beneath the earth into the crumbling intestines of ages past.</em></p><p><em>There are wicked and cruel dungeons that were built back earlier than the memories of cities, nations, and empires dare remember, a shadowy place long forgotten and lost to the sun and the streets where ordinary people walk. But the churchâs corrupt, inner circle remembers these places and uses them extensively. The many and varied instruments of interrogation and cruelty are well-worn and as devious as their original inventors. The girls quickly realize that things are about to get much, much worse for them.</em></p><p><em>Captain Saul Macchione is nothing if not methodical. Fortunately for him, and unfortunately for the girls, he LOVES the task set before him. His cock throbs at the thought of slowly twisting and breaking these girls until they would give up every bit of their precious selves in order to avoid more pain. He takes them to task with the ardor and fervor of a man possessed. Captain Saul Macchione knows how to break people, and he is especially skilled in breaking beautiful, haughty women.</em></p><p><em>Captain Saul shows no mercy, and neither do his minions.</em></p><p><em>The girls will learn the meaning of pain and suffering and humiliation! No matter what they do, there is no hope for them down here! Their pleas fall on deaf ears, for there is no promise that they can give to a man who loves to break women and hear them scream in complete and utter agony!</em></p><p><em>âYouâd best pray to your God, because he canât hear you down here!â</em></p><p><em>âMany girls march in here, but strange enough, none ever leave!â</em></p><p><em>There are no limits to a man who is drunk on sadistic lusts and power. Maria and Lina will pay for their crimes, both real and imagined, and these Shadows of the City will disappear into a much darker, depraved, and perverted shadow that does not see them as people or champions of freedom and justice. To these dark dungeons, buried beneath the earth and hidden from the world, Maria and Lina are only two tight, gorgeous, sexy, and horny bitches to be beaten, fucked, and broken.</em></p><p><em>And the fun has only just begun...</em></p><p> </p>",

Thomas Newman is gussied up in his most expensive suit, one that no ordinary trucker should be able to afford. Aboard the helicopter is a bevy of high powered individuals, two U.S. Generals, a sultanate Prince, and a secret member of âthe partyâ from across the Pacific. One of the Generals, General Andrews, is a friend of Thomas Newman and a frequent visitor to the Slave Factory. He has told some of his friends about the place, and they are curious to see what kind of sadistic and perverted delights are hidden withinâ¦</p><p>Thomas Newman spares no expenseâ¦ and no fleshâ¦ to ensure that his visitors receive the tour of a lifetime! The facilities are extensive and designed to ensure top quality product for the buyersâ¦ even if that means a living hell for the girls going through their terrible training!</p><p>As the tour goes deeper into the Slave Factory, the training gets more intenseâ¦ more extremeâ¦ anyone who would be normal might be horrified at what they seeâ¦ but for these high powered individuals, all they want is more...</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Deep in the bowels of Thomas Newmanâs Slave Factory is the âInterrogation Roomâ where he keeps his most prized possessions, ready to âplayâ for him or any high powered clientele he might bring with him. Today, he has a special treat for his guests, two U.S. Generals, an Arab Prince, and a Chinese, communist minister: Agent Lindy and her poor sister Helen!</em></p><p><em>General Andrews always had a problem with how sneaky and underhanded the CIA was. General Martin just hated all the uppity white bitches that would always talk smack to a poor brother like him. Prince Amir and Mr. Chen are simply sadists who enjoy nothing more than forcing a white female to do their sick bidding.</em></p><p><em>The party is just getting started, and Agent Lindy and her sister Helen are the main course on the menu! They will be mere playthings to the four wicked and twisted menâ¦ whether they survive is another matter!</em></p><p> </p>",

As Helen is about to discover, after her car breaks down on a lonely mountain road, Tom is a slaver and in the back of his truck sheâll be hauled off to become one of his expensive top-quality fuck sluts.</em></p><p><em>In a dark, abandoned factory Helen and the other girls that have been taken will learn what it takes to become the best pleasure slaves in the world. Their pussies will be undergo severe stretching and fucking sessions on hard plastic dildos until they start begging for the pleasure of a real human cock. Repeated whipping and clamping of their big tits will make their nipples especially tender for their new masters. Yet these are only the first steps.</em></p><p><em>Helen and her fellow sluts-in-training will have to learn to fuck, suck, and suffer like true whores before theyâre allowed to leave the factory and begin their new lives as fuck meat. Theyâll learn to mount dildos no matter how many sharp ridges they might be covered in, and theyâll learn to obediently worship the warm, pulsing cock of any man who wants them. Cum will taste as sweet as wine to these girls by the time theyâre fully trained.</em></p><p><em>But maybe there is hopeâ¦Helenâs sister Lindy is in the CIA and sheâs come looking for her sister, but will she save Helen in time?

    "description": "<p><em>One of the most bloody wars in history took place towards the end of the 19th Century, the Taiping Rebellion. The rebellion was led by a visionary who had been told in a vision that he was the younger brother of Christ. He set up the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and controlled large areas of Southern China. At least 20 million people died in the fourteen years of fighting between the Heavenly Kingdom and the Qing dynasty. There are no statistics about the rape and pillage that accompanied the warâ¦</em></p><p><em>The Heavenly Kingdom believed in the equality of men and women, so there were female soldiers and female Generals in their armyâ¦</em></p><p><em>One day General Shen Sue was leading a group of soldiers when they met troops of the Qing Dynasty Imperial Army. The General and four of her female soldiers survived the battle. The Imperial General gave orders to take them off into the woods. Groups of three soldiers carried them off and stripped them naked.</em></p><p><em>The men had not had contact with women for several months. They were hungry for sex. When they saw the Generalsâ lovely naked breasts they could not believe their luck.</em></p><p><em>In different parts of the wood, the four soldiers and stripped and abusedâ¦</em></p><p><em>Things get very complicated for General Shen Sue when the girls return. The enemy has discovered that one of them is her sisterâ¦</em></p><p><em>The General has little choice. To save her sister, she swears allegiance to the Imperial forces, and is obliged to take part in the Imperial Generalâs very public Initiation Ceremonyâ¦</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Oliver and Laura, a brother and sister duo, took a trip into the south Pacific to try and have some fun in the sun. Sister Laura wanted some quality family time, but Oliver was too busy playing with the âgirlfriendsâ heâd picked up in Singapore. Disgusted by her brotherâs behavior, Laura tried to find a secluded space on this deserted, Pacific island so she could relax and work on her tan...</em></p><p><em>Unfortunately for lovely Laura, the island wasnât as deserted as it seemed from the shore. Sheâs found by a native hunter who is enchanted by her beauty. The hunter brings lovely Laura back to his tribe, pleased to have provided his friends with this exotic and exquisite white playmate...</em></p><p><em>Laura is brutally used by the natives. Her beauty overwhelms them, and they lust after her pure, white flesh...</em></p><p><em>And even worse, the natives seem to have mastery over some kind of exotic incense. Whenever itâs inhaled by a woman, it sends her into a hot and horny sexual frenzy! Lovely Laura loses her mind and finds herself lusting wildly after cock, especially big, thick, black native cock!</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile, Oliver is worried about his sister. Laura has been gone for nearly two hours... where could she have gone? He and the girls go searching after Laura, blissfully unaware of the horrors that await them all...</em></p><p><em>Will the teenage tourists escape this island of insanity?</em></p><p><em>Or are they doomed to an awful fate?</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>One of the most bloody wars in history took place towards the end of the 19th Century, the Taiping Rebellion. The rebellion was led by a visionary who had been told in a vision that he was the younger brother of Christ. He set up the Taiping Heavenly kingdom and controlled large areas of Southern China. The heavenly Kingdom believed in the equallty of men and women, so there were female soldiers and even female Generals in their army...</em></p><p><em>In the previous part of our story, the army of the Quing dynasty captured 4 rebellious female soldiers and their female general. After torturing the helpless women, the men of the army got their captives to betray another female general, Xiao Miyun.</em></p><p><em>Now, in part 2 of our story, the beautiful prisoners of war are marched to the capital and presented to the magistrate for \"interrogation.\" They know that the horrors they have endured so far were only the beginning...</em></p><p><em>The Qing dynasty has many ingenious devices for torture. The magistrate forces the female general to watch as her soldiers are subjected to new horrors, one by one. Everyone expects the magistrate to tell his men to use the women sexually, but strangely, he does not. The women are whipped, stripped naked, hung from their fingers and subjected to horrible pain. But the magistrate does not let the men use them sexually...</em></p><p><em>But it turns out that the magistrate was just saving the best pussy for himself. Finally, after forcing the female general to watch her soldiers' torture, the magistrate has the female general herself taken down the dungeons...</em></p><p><em>They use the female general's body in every way they can imagine. She is totally helpless and powerless to resist. The men of the Quing dynasty quickly reduce her to nothing more than a cock-sucking slut.</em></p>",

Only Lei Baoâs loyalist soldiers were even allowed to watch. Now, Lei Bao announces that the entire town will get to enjoy the female prisoners of war.</em></p><p><em>The women are forced to participate in a humiliating parade, so that the crowds of cheering men can laugh at them. Then Lei Bao does the unthinkable; he allows even the lowly, common men to fuck his prisoners in a giant city-wide gang-bang.</em></p><p><em>The women must be taught that even the lowest of men are still above women. These women tried to rise up and claim equal rights to men. An example must be made, not just for the rebels, but for all the women of China; to make sure that women never again try to become equal to men.</em></p><p><em>The torture of the female rebels will be legendary. Their suffering and sexual abuse will be so great, that it will echo across history, and frighten women in China for generations to comeâ¦</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>You and me donât know each other, buddy. Thatâs a good thing. You see, when somebody gets too greedy and starts cutting in on my bossâ business thatâs when Iâm called in. I fix problems so they donât bother my boss no more. Sometimes I solve problems in a back alley or sometimes at the end of a pier. It donât matter. When I take a case I see it all the way through no matter how ugly things get.</em></p><p><em>Take this one case I had. Leggy brunette, 21 years old, smart as a whip. Too smart, if you ask me. Thought she could pull a fast one on the company. Youâd think that a high-falutin college grad with a Ph.D would know better. Guess not. Ph.D must stand for âpretty hot dameâ because this one was a looker all right. Me and my partner were looking her up and down as she was crying on the floor before us.</em></p><p><em>Maybe it was my partner that scared her. Heâs got an ugly mug, so that makes sense. Her eyes were wide with terror as he strapped her onto the metal table. Guess all his scars made her tremble, or it was because the table had hinges and springs so it could beâ¦ arrangedâ¦ in any way we wanted.</em></p><p><em>She might have been crying because of me. Iâm not much to look at and Iâve got a violent streak a mile wide. I had to show the dame who was boss, ya know? Make her understand real good that when I say do something, she better do it. She didnât like it much, but tearing her clothes to ribbons with one hand while my other handâ¦ Well, you can probably picture what I mean.</em></p><p><em>But I donât blame the chick for losing it when she heard the howling from behind that steel door. You never seen a doll so terrified, it was like sheâd been turned to stone! That racket sounded like an entire zoo rolling down a hill. But the thing making that howling has never been seen anywhere outside of a nightmare. I guess it could smell her fear! Yeah, that creature gets restless around feeding timeâ¦</em></p><p> </p>",
