Waking up with your face shoved in the stinking, smelly snatch of another woman under threat of a bamboo caning isn’t the best way to start the day. But Hannah knows what the punishment will be if she doesn’t put her tongue to good use keeping her spoiled, Chinese mistress happy. She swallows her pride and a whole lot more if it means less punishment from her demanding mistress.</em></p><p><em>But as much fun as Mistress Chyou is having with her new, white pet “Meimei”, the bills are piling up and her own tastes are evolving as well. Chyou is an accomplished gold digger, a hot ticket on the Chinese meat market. She has no lack of suitors to pay for her expensive tastes. But why waste her own perfect, youthful body to “pay back” these solicitous paramours when she has another set of tight, young holes to keep her “boyfriends” happy?</em></p><p><em>“After all, why ruin MY girlish figure when YOU do better?”</em></p><p><em>Hannah will wish she was dead by the end.

The villains try everything to bring these women down… bribery, threats, intimidation … but nothing works on these dedicated young officers.</em></p><p><em>Don Giordano, next in Linda Crow’s sites, is not happy at the prospect of a jail sentence. He calls a meeting of the remaining families and they agree it’s time to eliminate the cop bitches…</em></p><p><em>And … they have a trump card, FBI Chief Frank Harris! Chief Harris likes money and dislikes Agent Crow. She refused his sexual advances - in front of the other agents. For that humiliation, Chief Harris vows to see her brought down.</em></p><p><em>The gangsters set up a fake drug delivery at a warehouse on the docks and Linda Crow takes the bait. Her boss assigns her to take photos of the delivery. It’s her big chance to put the bastards in jail.</em></p><p><em>That is Linda Crow’s LAST MISSION as an FBI agent. The following day the news reports her death in a car accident.</em></p><p><em>Cruelly chained and gagged in Don Giordano’s limousine, the young agent attends her own funeral… That is to be her last trip outside. From that day forward, former FBI agent Linda Crow becomes Don Giordano’s unwilling sex-slave…</em></p><p><em>\"From now on and for the rest of your fucking life, you only get laid by one man. And it's me. You better get used to it...!</em></p><p><em>Linda’s life becomes a non-ending round of degradation, humiliation and pain as the Don’s private cum-slut. Her huge, gorgeous tits are Don Giordano’s favorite fuck toys. He drools over her quivering breasts as he lavishes attention to them in every way imaginable. But the rest of her long-legged, well-rounded, firm white body isn’t ignored or neglected either...</em></p><p> </p>",

Well off the normal tourist paths in a Mexican town not far from the U.S. border, Hotel Eden is a training camp for young, beautiful, female sex slaves of every size and color.</em></p><p><em>The Hostel is frequented by local drug lords and many of the women held there are the daughters, sweethearts and even wives of competing drug lords. Once trained, the women have no choice but to serve El Hombre in his depraved sex club.</em></p><p><em>Eva and Maria are the newest to arrive at Hotel Eden. The internet website they used to make their reservations never hinted at what awaited them. Within a few minutes of checking into their room, they are overcome by the perverted El Hombre. He doesn’t personally train every woman, but Eva appeals to him and he likes her feisty spirit...</em></p><p><em>\"Yeah, very beautiful... Big, hard nipples. Great boobs… More than a handful with plenty spilling over... Just begging for attention... Begging to be pinched ‘n squeezed... and bitten ‘n sucked! I love pink, rosy nips!\"</em></p><p><em>What happens next is a merry-go-round of sexual humiliation; a nightmare of perversion and depravity...</em></p><p><em>Eva escapes, but doesn’t get far...</em></p><p><em>She soon finds out the true nature of Hotel Eden. Every room is occupied by a beautiful woman being trained or punished with every sexual device and in every way that can be imagined... Each room is worse than the previous one.</em></p><p><em>Quickly brought under control by El Hombre, Eva is punished for her resistance.</em></p><p><em>\"Ah, chica, here you are… running wasn’t smart.<br /> Now the punishment will be very severe… <br /> Every part of your hot body will feel my fury.\"</em></p><p><em>Eva is then forced to participate in the huge sex orgy held nightly for El Hombre’s customers. There are private rooms for special clients and well-stocked dungeons for sadistic perverts. And an unlimited choice of very special women with very expensive price tags.</em></p>",

She’s just moved to China with her husband Richard, and is exploring the exotic city of Shanghai.</em></p><p><em>While her husband works, the young bride wanders through the mysterious foreign markets happily unaware that her sexy body has attracted the attention of a gang of thugs.</em></p><p><em>Taking a wrong turn, Sofia accidentally walks down a dark alley and finds out for herself that Shanghai has a very dark side!</em></p><p><em>The chaotic bustle of Shanghai is an illusion hiding a shadowy network of markets which specialize in human merchandise.</em></p><p><em>A blonde, foreign visitor will bring in a good price once the market samples the good first!</em></p><p><em>Before Sofia can understand what has happened, she is moved from one dark location to another. Each time getting further and further away from her increasingly worried husband.</em></p><p><em>Whenever she thinks she’s seen the worst side of Shanghai, the sprawling city shows her another face even more cruel.</em></p><p><em>Sofia realizes that to survive in a foreign land, she must endure the unendurable.</em></p><p><em>Forced to participate in acts she finds abhorrent, the innocent housewife looks for any opportunity to escape from this underworld of perversion and return to the life she was snatched from.</em></p><p><em>But in the hands of her foreign captors, she knows that time is not on her side.</em></p><p><em>Shanghai’s black market is extensive, and it’s roots run deep. Wherever there’s a perversion, and a buyer willing to pay good money for it, the market will supply the product… even if the product is kicking and screaming.</em></p><p><em>Sofia’s mind rebels at the humiliations she has to perform, especially on stage!</em></p><p><em>The rowdy crowd of Chinese men shout at the newest attraction and hurl disgusting suggestions at the blonde tourist… telling her how she can debase herself further for their pleasure.</em></p><p> </p>",

Beautiful young women could expect far worse: a lifetime of subjugation and enslavement!</em></p><p><em>While studying abroad, Julie became so caught up in her class work that she accidentally let her student visa expire.</em></p><p><em>Now she has been sold to a twisted couple who has designs on the busty brunette far different from the bright future she’d imagined for herself.</em></p><p><em>They plan on turning the strong-willed student into a lithe fighting machine, even if they have to break her to do it!</em></p><p><em>Julie shifted on the wooden bench, trying to relieve the searing cramps shooting up her firm legs. The ropes tied around her ankles were lashed firmly to the stone walls of the room, spreading her in the most humiliating position she could imagine.</em></p><p><em>She was fully exposed, helpless to her owner’s lustful gaze, probing fingers and horrific machines. A sob caught in her throat as she thought about the machines...</em></p><p><em>She tried to twist away from the cruel device, but she had been strapped firmly to the frame of the ghastly training structure.</em></p><p><em>Her hands were numb, the constricting bands cutting off her circulation with the slightest move. But instead of bringing relief from the torment, the pain grew worse. She concentrated on the burning sensation of the rough ropes on her smooth skin, trying to block out the pain which grew inside her from the owner’s twisted machine.</em></p><p><em>The girl is in for a serious training as a 'CUNT COMBAT' fighter. But first, the sadistic couple who owns her has to break her in...</em></p><p><em>The canvas mat must have been stretched over a concrete floor. The force of the throw punched the air from her lungs as if she’d run straight into a brick wall.</em></p><p><em>Julie’s head swam, and she tried to focus on the figure lunging at her.</em></p><p><em>The other woman was an illegal immigrant just like her, but forced to engage in the bloodsport for the slim chance of winning her freedom.</em></p><p><em>Her skin was slick with sweat, and her wild main of hair flew behind her like a banner.</em></p><p><em>Julie’s eyes widened in panic and she threw herself to the side in a desperate attempt to avoid getting pinned.</em></p><p><em>In this sadistic sport getting pinned was only the start of the humiliation a victorious woman would inflict on the beaten opponent!</em></p><p><em>Only one can win... the other, the loser, is severely punished in front of the crowd. It is part of the show!</em></p><p><em>And she's punished by her disappointed Master and Mistress back at home...</em></p><p><em>But Julies' misery doesn't end here... Convinced that they will never get a good 'CUNT COMBAT' fighter out of her, they decide to sell her to a slave shop.</em></p><p><em>To Julie's horror, a young couple buys her... as a breeding slave!</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Ariel and Chelsea never imagined they’d appear on the nightly news, at least not like this! Ariel, the pretty brunette daughter of one of Andersons leading citizens, always daydreamed about being a news anchor. She often pictured herself confidently reading the stories of the day behind the news desk, smiling for the camera. Now her picture is on every channel as the town searches for any trace of her and her beautiful blonde sister.</em></p><p><em>Chelsea struggled to stay on top of the obese man’s body. Her slender legs squeezed his hips as he bucked beneath her. She gave a gasp of panic as she felt herself starting to slide off of him again, and threw her weight forward to keep her balance. He was such a fat slob! No wonder he had to resort to extremes to get a woman! He was disgusting, and not just because he waddled when he walked or the rolls of fat which covered his gut. He seldom bathed, and his breath smelled vile. But worst of all was his temper which flared up at every opportunity.</em></p><p><em>She felt a jolt of panic as she started to topple off of his quivering bulk...</em></p><p><em>“Dammit, bitch! Where do you think you’re going?” Grabbing her tender breasts in hands like steel claws he forced her down into her knees. Chelsea sobbed uncontrollably and shot a look to her sister who was waiting in the corner for her turn. She looked miserable and helpless.</em></p><p><em>Ariel bit her tongue to keep her teeth from chattering. The freezing pit she’d been thrown into was a nightmare!</em></p><p><em>She wondered what sick mind could think up such a thing.</em></p><p><em>She was naked, and the icy dank started to seep into her bones. She felt her arms and legs cramp and her fingers go numb.</em></p><p><em>She shivered and suddenly tasted blood. She’d bitten her tongue until she bled.</em></p><p><em>She tried to look over her shoulder to see her sister, but the iron collar locked tightly around her neck kept her from moving.</em></p><p><em>She felt frost on the collar, and the cold metal bit into her skin.</em></p><p><em>Was she going to get frostbite, she wondered?</em></p><p><em>If she got any colder she’d go into shock, she knew that.</em></p><p><em>Her naked body shivered again.</em></p><p><em>That wouldn’t stop HIM, of course. He would think it was funny to see her fighting for breath, struggling to keep alive against the relentless cold.</em></p><p><em>Then he’d probably take her out and come up with even more horrible ways make her wish she were dead!</em></p><p><em> </em></p>",

    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>The economic troubles of the 21st century only got worse as the leaders of the world tried desperately to salvage the situation. In the end, it just wasn't enough, and society collapsed completely as nations were torn apart not by external enemies or foreign militaries but by the angry, average citizen, enraged at the injustices and failures of governments to solve the world-wide economic crisis.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>The nation-state model was no more, but the people still needed something to replace it.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>They banded together in clans, tribes, and gangs for safety and protection. Some people, though, came together for a completely different reason: to fulfill the deepest, darkest, and most twisted desires of men who had the power and the toys to get the job done.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>The B.C.C., or Black Cunt Catchers, was one such clan.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Things change, times change, and the world changes, but there is one thing that never changes: human nature.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Men want women.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>That's a fact, and there were sick, disgusting men who wanted the prettiest, daintiest, and most pure women to break and mold into their own personal, mindless sex-slaves! Wherever there's a demand, there will be a supply, and the B.C.C. were there to give men what they want.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Officer Delmar Woods worked for the B.C.C., based in the ruins of old Los Angeles, California.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Even if the United States of America was no more, there was still a healthy, sexy, delicious population of beautiful, desirable females who roamed the abandoned streets and alleys of the metropolitan husk.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Delmar Woods didn't just work for the Black Cunt Catchers, he was their top, elite officer. His C.C.S., or Cunt Catcher Squad was the best in the entire organization.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>He swept the streets of L.A., and he never came back empty handed.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>The one thing Delmar Woods was good at was catching fine, fat puss and making them ready for market! He ran a tight unit, but he never failed to reward his men for a job well done... and as the top officer of his Cunt Catcher Squad, he had the privilege of owning his own, personal slavegirl for his own, personal use. His mama always told him not to break things, but Delmar didn't listen all that well...</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Delmar is a vicious, merciless hunter who gets the job done! No doubt.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>But Delmar has stiff competition from a lesbian, sadistic bitch: Officer Keisha, who commands her own Cunt Catcher Squad.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Keisha's Squad is made up of the most vile, twisted, and brutal men in the entire Black Cunt Catcher organization. Most squads can make their quota, but Keisha's squad has this bad habit of bringing back girls broken, battered, and in pieces... Keisha could easily beat Delmar, if she didn't find such sick, lusty pleasure in watching her men break poor, defenseless women.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Officer Keisha didn't mind. She had her eye on a pretty young thing, all caramel black and delicious looking, good enough to eat. Mama always told her not to play with her food, but Keisha didn't listen all that well...</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>The Black Cunt Catchers didn't run on charity. They were a well-funded organization with a lot of rich and powerful clients. At the end of the week, an auction was held, and the women they'd caught weren't treated with decency or respect. Oh no. They were herded out on the runway like cattle and put on display for the buyers... these lusty, horny men and women had no shame. They knew what they wanted, and they weren't afraid to show it! The crowd isn't content just to watch the meat walk by, oh no. Many of the buyers want a closer, more intimate inspection, and some even get personal with the merchandise and want to get a feel for the goods themselves. Even some of their girlfriends were getting in on the fun too, getting wet and horny just imagining breaking these stuck-up, snotty white girls and bending them to their will... such pretty, defenseless girls in the hands of the most twisted, merciless men and women imaginable!</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Officers Delmar Woods and Keisha watch from the private box of Sheik Ahmed, one of their richest and most powerful clients. He wanted to organize a special expedition, a personalized hunt for some prospective new allies. Officer Delmar knew not to cross the old man, but stupid Keisha was too proud to let some fat, disgusting man push her around. She dared to insult Sheik Ahmed and then stormed off to blow off some steam on her new, helpless prize...</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>The Sheik's new friends are taken out to the Mojave Desert with their “hunt” all strung up and ready to run. Compared to the buyers at the auction and the Black Cunt Catcher squads, these guys were even worse! Society may have gone to shit, but technology marched on, and these hunters had new toys they were just itching to try on sexy, virgin tartlets!</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>They just bought these fresh faced new fuckholes, and they were eager and anxious to draw out the poor girls' misery and suffering! There would be no relief for these poor, young things. They were at the mercy of ruthless, brutal men who had only one thought on their mind: breaking and pounding virgin puss!</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>They release the girls, but they know the poor things won't get far...</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Don't miss this brand new comic from an amazing, brand new artist: Igor! The scenes you'll find are stunningly colored, beautifully drawn, and amazingly rendered. This is an amazing story that you don't want to miss! Watch gorgeous, shapely young women used and abused by sick, merciless men!</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The kingdom of Meszria, Stronghold of civilization in the eastern marches and symbol of justice for the hardy tribes of the plains. The walled city which has risen unchanging from the stony hills for generations has fallen. The city of King Brandoc is dying And the vultures are circling to tear living meat from its ancient bones. Five years of conflict have warped the invading army. Nights freezing in the mud and mire have driven them to the point of savagery. Endless days of gory battle and hunger create a need that nothing but a woman begging for her life can fill.</em></p><p><em>The light of the city fires washes their sweaty faces in a bloody glow.</em></p><p><em>The barbaric army advances...</em></p><p><em>The city has been under siege for months. Starvation has weakened the defenders. When the walls fall with a deafening crash, they are cut down in an orgy of violence.</em></p><p><em>The lucky ones fall quickly under sword and axe.</em></p><p><em>The unlucky ones twitch and scream in the streets, alive enough to witness the fate of their loved ones, but unable to do anything but watch and pray for the end.</em></p><p><em>The city square, once a place of beauty and quiet dignity, is transformed into a market for captured flesh.</em></p><p><em>Princess Astrid’s hands involuntarily flew to her heaving breasts as she huddled in the inky shadows of the city street. The castle had fallen, and the savage invaders were tearing through the marketplace, yanking daughters from their mother’s hands and hauling away every beautiful young woman.</em></p><p><em>She stifled a scream of horror. They were killing innocent civilians!</em></p><p><em>More than one aged grandfather or overprotective mother fell under the sword as they tried to protect the women from this horde.</em></p><p><em>Any efforts to stop the bloodshed were futile, Astrid knew.</em></p><p><em>She gathered the folds of her cloak tightly around her firm, lush body and crept towards the Western gate. If she could flee the violence of the burning city for the security of the mountains, she just might stand a chance…</em></p><p><em>The jeweled bodice ripped from Queen Raelyn’s lush body, her firm breasts springing free. From the corner of her eye she saw her bound husband strapped to the foot of their bed…. The same bed the hulking barbarian was going to use to ravage her body… all while her husband watched!</em></p><p><em>She burned with shame as thick, calloused fingers caressed her body, grabbing the tender flesh of her thighs and probing her moist slit.</em></p><p><em>The leather whip twisted in the air like a cobra before it struck her ample breasts. Immediately a blood-red welt appeared where the braided thong had landed, and the courtyard shook with her hysterical screams. She tried to fill her lungs with air, but her head was ringing with pain and it was a agonizing struggle just to breathe. The chains which bound her to the stake chaffed her skin, and her arms cramped with the pressure of trying to support her slumped body. The lash hovered in the smoky air once again, and fell…</em></p><p><em>The young woman had never been with a man before. Her first time would be with him, naked and humiliated on the floor of the throne room while dozens of peasants watched and jeered! His swelling cock ached for relief, and the horrified woman sobbing at his feet would give it to him… exactly how a captured sex-slave should be used!</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>T</i><em>he world has changed. War is coming.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>The common people can feel it in their bones, they can feel it in their flesh, and they can smell it in the sex-soaked Pits of the Orcish legions. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>It began when the barbarian king Jiskall, better known as The Black Bull, led his Orcish legions over the mountainside from distant places, now unknown. They crashed down on the kingdoms of the land and utterly destroyed all who stood in their path. The lordships, towns, kingdoms, and empires that once stood in his path were utterly destroyed. Their lands were salted, their crops razed, their homes and villages burned to the ground, and their fields left overflowing with blood and ash. Those that survived, the most beautiful and delicate girls, were left to the Orcish hordes to a fate worse than death! Rumor and panic spread before the armies of The Black Bull, and entire towns and villages emptied before his arrival, desperate to escape before the savage and brutal Orcs appeared, slaughtered their men, and violated their women!</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>History became legend. Legend became myth, and things, which should not have been forgotten, were lost. The happy people who had once lived in these lands were replaced by an ever growing horde of Orcish warriors, crude in behavior, vicious in battle, and lustful for human female flesh. Jiskall, The Black Bull, settled those lands and named his empire Argunda, and the land rotted under the weight of so much Orcish flesh and human female slaves. Jiskall gathered around him only the most sinister and vicious of people as his advisors: Astrar, the Beast; Sebastian, the Spider; and Ella, the Bloody Whip. The surrounding kingdoms were so afraid of the Orcish army now seated at their doorstep that they would do whatever it took to please and appease The Black Bull. Anything was better than to become a victim of the Orcish legions. Even if it meant sending off all their prettiest women, if it would appease The Black Bull, it was worth it.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>In time, though, even this tribute was not enough. New sources of female flesh were needed to feed the Orcish Legions and the black, thieving traitors who gathered like vultures to the land of Argunda. The nearby lands were tapped of all their prettiest and most beautiful girls to the point that their liege lords and kings had to sacrifice their own, royal relatives in order to appease the demands of The Black Bull. Lavinia, thriving ever in the shadow of Argunda, was ruled by the fat and cowardly King Leopold.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>When the “tax collectors” of Argunda came, they were dissatisfied with the proffered fare. King Leopold had to give away his freshest, choicest slavegirls, tight and raw and completely untrained, in order to satisfy the wicked men of Argunda.

It was said that the only ones who surpassed her beauty were her daughters, Princess Lana and Princess Luna. It was said that this Queen Elizabet Goldenhair welcomed all women from all races and nations and offered them a world free of patriarchal injustice and abuse. It was a haven, a sanctuary for beaten and frightened women throughout the known world.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>This news interested The Black Bull.

Queen Elizabet Goldenhair is now aware of the threat of the Argundan army and the Orcish legions. She is troubled by what she saw in the chained Orcish Howlers. Thera cannot stand against such a wicked and lustful force alone. It must seek allies, or else her queendom and all its innocent and virginal women will be in danger.</em></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Forces gather and plots abound as royal intrigue comes to a boil. War is coming, and it will affect everyone from the most trusting and loyal soldier to royal, female flesh. Kings, Queens, Princesses, and barbarian lords will clash. A storm is coming, and there can be only one victor.</em></p><p> </p>",

Leaving their dorm room behind, the two girlfriends chart a course that will take them to every nightclub and hot spot along the West Coast. The summer days are long, and each morning brings the possibility of adventure and romance for the two fun-loving students.</em></p><p><em>When the season starts to draw to a close, Mia and Sherry reluctantly turn their thoughts back to schoolwork and the coming semester. With their bank accounts nearly exhausted, the friends make their way to a bus terminal to catch a ride back home.</em></p><p><em>Saying goodbye to the friends they’ve made on their trip, the sexy young women don’t realize that they’re saying goodbye to more than just their vacation. They’re also saying goodbye to everything they have ever known!</em></p><p><em>Sherry is a blonde knockout, who always knows how to have a good time and isn’t afraid of meeting new people or having new experiences. The spirited young woman knows that her smile and curves can get her anything she wants, but has always kept her feminine power in check. What’s the use of flaunting her good looks, when she’s just looking for some innocent fun? Besides, she has to keep an eye on her naive friend, Mia.</em></p><p><em>Mia has always been the more reserved of the two, but that doesn’t mean she’s a wallflower. Her lustrous red hair turns plenty of heads, and the wiggle in her walk can make even faithful husbands stop in their tracks. But such games are just innocent fun to the friendly redhead, and hanging out with her best friend is more fun than getting serious with any boy.</em></p><p><em>A sheltered life has protected the beautiful girls from harm, but once they decide to experience adventure on the road, nobody is around to protect them.</em></p><p><em>For each safe dance club in the city, there are dozens of alleyways and abandoned buildings crawling with low-life scum who would kill for the chance to get their hands on the shapely girlfriends.</em></p><p><em>The Longest Journey starts in California... and twists its way through the darkest dens of corruption... before winding up on the Dark Continent itself: Africa!</em></p><p><em>This is not a first class journey.... to a luxury lodge in a National Park... but a dreadful voyage to hell!</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>When Olivia was recruited by an Ivy League college she knew she’d have to prove herself against students from all over the world. But the buxom young woman wasn’t worried in the slightest. With a stellar GPA and a body to die for, the bright college girl quickly became the most popular girl on campus. And now she’s just been promoted to head the cheerleading squad! Life couldn’t get any better for her, and she’s ready for any challenge that’s thrown her way.</em></p><p><em>Amehd eyes the perky blonde from across the cafeteria. He knows that his fellow students think of him as a slow witted clown. He’s only been in the country for a few months, and isn’t eager to make friends. Back in Barafain the people line the streets to watch the swarthy young prince pass by...</em></p><p><em>But over here it’s a different story. The women are rude and willful. But that new girl who turns all the guys heads might be worth the effort. After all, what college girl isn’t impressed by wealth, right?</em></p><p><em>The guy couldn't be more wrong ...</em></p><p><em>And Olivia couldn't have made a worse mistake.</em></p><p><em>Wearing the burka felt like being stuffed in a canvas sack. The shapeless cloth scratched her bare skin and rubbed her raw with every movement. Olivia struggled to control her breathing.</em></p><p><em>The burka was hot and clung to her shapely figure. Where was she? The last thing she remembered was having a drink while waiting for her friends to arrive at the local bar. Suddenly her stomach tied itself in knots and her vision blurred. After that… nothing.</em></p><p><em>The marble lining the walls of the harem room sweated from the heat generated by the bodies crawling on the floor.</em></p><p><em>Dozens of young women crawled across the richly carpeted floor, their eyes wide with fright. Olivia wrinkled her nose at the thick musk in the air. It was a mixture of sweat and fear. She gagged when she realized that it was coming from her.</em></p><p><em>Emir Abdul shifted his massive bulk in the custom designed chair and enjoyed the site before him.</em></p><p><em>The three new women were trying to hide behind each other, eager to avoid attracting his attention. The silver bells sewn into their harem garments jingled with every nervous movement. He smiled and ran his tongue over his thick lips. Yes, these would do nicely for an evenings entertainment.

    "description": "<p><em>Olivia, the buxom valedictorian, has suddenly disappeared from the college where she was the most popular student on campus. Her mother was worried that something might have happened to her strong willed daughter, but a message on Fakebook explained everything. Olivia fell in love with the swarthy son of a wealthy emirate family. Amehd had everything that Olivia detested; a greasy smile, distain for Western values and the manners of a pig.</em></p><p><em>Mrs. Hamilton shrugged her shoulders. Love really is blind!</em></p><p><em>Obsessed with the mystery behind her daughters sudden infatuation with a sleazy Middle Eastern womanizer, Mrs. Hamilton eagerly jumped at the chance to fly half way around the world and see the happy couple herself. Olivia sounded so different on Fakebook from the young woman she once was. Almost as if there was someone else pretending to be her own daughter…</em></p><p><em>Mrs. Hamilton felt her stomach lurch as she watched her future in-laws tear into the feast. They had money, no question about that!</em></p><p><em>The desert palace was as large as any European castle. But the smell! How could people live like this? The stench of unwashed bodies hung in the air as the harem girls in skimpy gauze costumes struggled to serve the overflowing platters of exotic dishes in chains.</em></p><p><em>It’s like being in a circus! Where do they find women willing to degrade themselves for these ignorant savages? And why did each serving girl have a look of absolute terror in their eyes?</em></p><p><em>The way of life of her future in law's is thousand miles away from the snobbish life Mrs. Hamilton is enjoying in America...</em></p><p><em>Soon, Mrs Hamilton was shattered into a billion pieces...</em></p><p><em>She's now the slave of her future in-law's... and treated accordingly...</em></p><p><em>The slave trainers black skin was glossy in the gloomy basement, almost as if it had been oiled.</em></p><p><em>He was a pillar of muscle and sinew. He looked like a man, but moved like a jungle predator with eyes always hunting for it’s next victim. The blonde moaned at his feet, her once beautiful face distorted in terror. He likes his job...</em></p><p><em>Feeling her tears fall onto his sweaty thighs, he felt himself grow with desire. She was almost broken, now. A few days ago she would have been sickened at the thought of dating someone like him, now she was ready to push herself beyond her limits to please him... and her Prince! Once the college colleague she publicly humiliated...</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>The first time I ever heard of General Tata was on the TV at home. I remember getting ready to go partying with Mia, my best friend...</p><p>The TV News reported that Lorna Collins had been freed during a dramatic rescue mission, but the truth is that Tata kept the beautiful woman hidden in his fortress. I didn't have a clue what had happened to her, and neither did anyone else.</p><p>After that I forgot all about General Tata and his country. I had more important things on my mind, like partying with my friends and spending daddy's money.</p><p>Then, almost a year later, my life took a horrible turn... Mia and I were coming back from a party in San Francisco when we missed the last bus that could take us back to the college where we lived. Not wanting to spend another minute in the seedy bus station we accepted a ride from a strange man who promised to take us home.</p><p>That was our fatal mistake.</p><p>We ended packed in crates and shipped overseas. I spent a month on my knees, chained inside the suffocating shipping container with almost no water or food. I didn't have room to stand. I was entombed with my own shit and filth. I had to use cat litter like an animal. In the stench and heat I thought I'd go insane before someone opened the box.</p><p>My only companion in the darkness was a dildo they'd locked in with me. I spent days curled in a ball clutching the buzzing vibrator in my sweaty, grime-streaked hands.rison. And then, when I was sure my life was over, <em>the panel was ripped open and 4 black faces leered at me.</em></p><p><em>I'd arrived in Tata's devastated country. The place which once seemed so far away and unimportant suddenly became terribly real.</em></p><p><em>I had arrived in Hell on Earth.</em></p><p><em>One year later</em></p><p><em>I fell into a sort of comatose state. I can't even remember his words, only that they were offensive and threatening. The suffocating heat, the oily grease, his rancid sweat, his stinging saliva, his revolting tongue, and his cum. Gallons of hot, thick, relentless cum everywhere. But worst of all was the misery, the humiliation, and the horror I felt.</em></p><p><em>Dongboy, Tata´s Mandingo enforcer, took care of us when the old ape was not around. His strength was enormous, and only surpassed by his brutality. His muscles were huge, but he had the brain of a rat. He couldn't comprehend anything but the urging of his gigantic dick. He was dangerous though, and could snap a woman's neck with two fingers.</em></p><p><em>Extreme cruelty and hate was everywhere. They treated us worse than livestock.</em></p><p><em>The more they hurt us, the more they humiliated us, the more they enjoyed it...</em></p><p><em>When an important guest arrived, like His Highness Abdul Abduyala Almerinejat, great Emir of Baranfain, we have to serve as waitresses...</em></p><p><em>Punishments were cruel, arbitrary and extremely humiliating....</em></p><p><em>Life in the military compound was Hell on earth. Tata and his crowd of drunken, drugged assassins knew nothing but cruelty! Their rampant, massive cocks throbbed all the time. The desert rats were loving humiliating us! They mixed with an ancestral hate for whites combined with unleashed lust. The more they hurt us, the more they humiliated us, the more they enjoyed it. To them, we weren’t human. We were toys for their twisted amusement.</em></p><p><em>Women had no hope in this country, especially foreigners like ourselves.</em></p><p><em>We were less than dirt to the dark skinned natives. The chains on our ankles and gags prying our mouths open told us what we were. We were slaves!</em></p><p><em>I used to have a bottle of perfume which cost as much as barrel of Russian caviar. I’d put a few drops behind my ears when I went out dancing with Mia at the clubs. With my long blonde hair cascading down my back I knew that I could have any guy in the place.</em></p><p><em>Now my hair was matted with sweat and grime, and my skin reeked of sex and terror. I longed for a hot bath, something to scrub away the filth which stuck to my lips… my thighs… But the only way a slave gets clean is by being chained to a concrete wall while the guards blast her with hoses.</em></p><p><em>I cried.</em></p><p><em>The tears left clean trails down my cheeks. How much longer before my new owner came back? My heart froze as the door slammed open!</em></p><p><em>Saliva ran down his rubbery face, and he smacked his thick lips with anticipation.</em></p><p><em>“I’ve never seen such a worthless piece of meat like you. You ain’t gonna last long here, infidel slut. Get any ideas of equality and respect out of your pretty head. You’ve got only one purpose in life now, worshiping my thick black dick!”</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><i>P</i><em>rince Ahmed and his sick family have sunk to new lows. New monsters arrive, and new toys are used to grind the poor harem girls into dust!</em></p><p><em>No matter how much these women plead, apologize, and submit, prince Ahmed and his family will not relent! Only more cruel punishment will come!</em></p><p><em>Abandoned by her father, Olivia Hamilton has no one she can turn to for help. The only person who knows what has happened to her is her mother, and she’s just become the newest captive in the prince’s growing harem of international sex slaves!</em></p><p><em>Ahmed’s hunger for white women hasn’t been satiated since we last saw him. If anything, it has only gotten worse. If there was ever a hell on Earth, these poor, helpless, captured girls would be caught in it!</em></p><p><em>Prince Ahmed must return to the United States to continue his education. While there, he will most certainly find fresh, unsuspecting victims for his voracious, sick appetite.</em></p><p><em>But first, he needs to be sated before he takes the long plane trip across land and sea...</em></p><p><em>Ahmed eyes the girls, well-trained sluts that have been taught to serve and service him and his every filthy, disgusting, sickening desire. Even the most well-trained and submissive of his harem are given no mercy. They are treated just as sickeningly as the rest. If anything, they are treated worse. One wrong word in their carefully crafted script, and they are punished in the most devastating way imaginable! One poor girl finds this out, to her horror!</em></p><p><em>Olivia is the preferred personal pet-slave of the Prince. She has been kept in constant servitude. Never allowed to rest, sleep, or recover, she is continuously used and abused by Prince Ahmed! Worst of all, Prince Ahmed knows how to hold a grudge. Even after all the abuse that poor Olivia has suffered, it isn’t enough to redeem herself in his eyes. He still remembers the humiliation he felt in the school cafeteria, and he will make sure she remembers it too for the rest of her miserable life!</em></p><p><em>Not even Olivia’s mother, Mrs. Hamilton, is spared by her own sick, twisted captor. Ahmed’s mother is enjoying Mrs. Hamilton in her own, sick, lezzie way. Prince Ahmed learned his worst and most monstrous habits from the best: his own mother and father!</em></p><p><em>Ahmed’s mother is satisfied with Mrs. Hamilton, as long as the white cow knows who’s in charge. The Arabian queen “rewards” the beaten and broken Mrs. Hamilton in increasingly sickening and disgusting ways! There is no mercy for the once-frigid, white MILF! She is the perfect target for every ounce of sickening perversion that the Arabian queen wishes to dish out.</em></p><p><em>The Emir of Barafain also has his own toys to play with. There is a hot, delicious new black nigra that he is eager to use until she is completely used up! He has a taste for pretty, black girls... “bruises don’t show up as easily!”</em></p><p><em>What will happen to poor Olivia? What will happen to poor Mrs. Hamilton?</em></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Brooke finds fun wherever she goes, and no wonder! She’s a spoiled rich girl with stunning good looks and an unlimited bank account. If she can’t find an off-the-hook party, she’ll start one!</em></p><p><em>Her buxom friends Tisha and Carly are along for the ride and have no problems making fun of the villagers they see living in poverty. After all, if the backward natives can’t find enough to eat it’s their own fault, right?</em></p><p><em>Driving through the slums and taking photos to show their friends back home is a blast, but the angry stares the sullen villagers give them made their skin crawl....</em></p><p><em>Once the sun sets, it’s time to go back to the resort where the REAL action is.</em></p><p><em>A sprawling cabana on the beach is the perfect place to party with other tourists on vacation. Brooke wrinkles her nose in disgust when she sees the shabby bus driver skulking at the edge of the outdoor party.</em></p><p><em>Sure, it’s his country… but doesn’t he have enough sense to see he’s not wanted here?</em></p><p><em>The three friends commit the worse mistake of their young lives....</em></p><p><em>The next day a roaring crowd detain two of the girls in their hotel room...  and drag them to the elder for punishment....</em></p><p><em>The black man grabs her hair and yanks her forward into the screaming crowd.</em></p><p><em>The mob roars like a zoo at feeding time. The rope tightens around her neck and she gasps for air. They're going to use her like a cheap hooker, if they don't rip her apart first!</em></p><p><em>Tisha screams alongside, and she whirls around in panic. The old man has forced her friend to her knees and is shoving her face into his filthy crotch.</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile, a strange woman in a burka has saved Brooke from the crowd. She offers the girl shelter...</em></p><p><em>Brooke is so scare that she can't figure out it's a trap. She finds herself locked up in a dark and tiny stone cell for days with no food or water... She's desperatly lonely. She can't talk or beg to anybody. No one has come to see her yet....</em></p><p><em>The fate of Tisha and Carly gets worse and worse after the elder's verdict...</em></p><p><em>Finally Brooke meets her captor. The door slams open, jolting her from a nightmare-riddled sleep. The walls of her cell are damp with mold.</em></p><p><em>How long has she been left alone? Maybe a week?</em></p><p><em>Her blurry eyes see the towering black man enter the room, lugging a large basket filled with depraved sex toys.</em></p><p><em>His first words are terrifying.... “From now on, you call every black man 'MASSA'\"</em></p><p> </p>",

After all the humiliation he’s suffered... first from Olivia, then from her snotty mother, and then from his lovely “wife” Jasmine... every single bitch who’s ever done him wrong has been firmly put in her place! Ahmed is finally living the life he’s deserved! He is, after all, a royal prince of the Emir of Baranfain... why shouldn’t he get what he wants?</em></p><p><em>But it doesn’t take long for his humiliations to return... after having so much pussy at his beck and call, it seems he can’t “perform” as well as he used to... his own father and mother are quick to notice during the devilish debauchery of their perverted breakfast!</em></p><p><em>It becomes a family squabble of the most sadistic and savage kind! The family soon starts to compete to see who has the best trained slaves... and their white, female fuckpets are the ones who really get the short end of the stick!</em></p><p><em>The girls are forced to perform for their masters and mistress... they have to suck cock... suck pussy... and hold back their orgasms under threat of extreme pain!</em></p><p><em>Prince Ahmed’s own harem comes up short, and his rage is explosive! His poor slavegirls won’t know what hit them when he finally lashes out!</em></p><p><em>But still, even in these depths of cruelty, Ahmed needs a little “help.” Princess Jasmine hired a brainy little nerd to work the labs, and he’s been cooking up something special for the Prince...</em></p><p><em>It helps Prince Ahmed get the job done... but something isn’t quite right in this perverted wonderland...</em></p><p> </p>",

In this backwater town, the saying is different: you can’t escape the long, thick cock of the law! Now a man might have a different opinion, especially one who is decent and upstanding, but Police Chief Kallahan, a sadistic, lesbian mistress, is no such kind of man. There’s a special kind of cruelty meted out from women to women, and Chief Kallahan, alongside her deputy Laverne, have no qualms about inflicting as much pain and punishment as possible…</em></p><p><em>Not only does the MILF mom, Mrs. Taylor, suffer for her “crimes,” but Sheriff Lester’s loyalties are tested as well, in ways he definitely didn’t sign up for. Rookie deputy Wilson is put through his paces and reminded that things are different in these here parts…</em></p><p><em>And Chief Kallahan’s needs are revealed in shocking and horrifying ways. Nobody will miss a stuck-up city slicker gone missing around here. Police “equipment” is expensive, after all, and Chief Kallahan has a powerful need for a lot of “tools of interrogation…”</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile, back at the Mugshot’s abode, the girls are put back into their rightful place: at the receiving end of the Mugshot family and friend’s crotches!</em></p><p><em>But things have a way of coming around as the mysterious Preacher calls all parties involved. An ominous Judge Dikson is waiting… and he will decide the fates of everyone… soon…</em></p><p> </p>",

Descended from an ancient line of nobility is no protection for the beautiful Princess Lhyra. Captured from her peaceful planet where she ruled in decadent splendor, the innocent young woman finds herself at the mercy of the Slavers Guild.</em></p><p><em>The mind-numbing shock of being reduced to the status of a pleasure-slave is made worse when she realizes her fate wasn’t accidental. She’s been snatched by order of the feared dark lord himself: Baron Slavos!</em></p><p><em>A wet tentacle wrapped around her thigh, leaving a trail of slime as it slid over her smooth skin. She recoiled in horror, but the metal cuffs held her firmly suspended from the ceiling of the vast room. Other women were bound in a semicircle on the metal platform, a humiliating display of wares being sold on the slave market.</em></p><p><em>The women were of different heights and builds, a variety of blondes and brunettes to fit the appetites of the buyers.</em></p><p><em>The only thing they had in common besides sex appeal was a look of horror on their beautiful faces.</em></p><p><em>The hot star-drive pulsed beneath her, its metal searing her skin as she lay sprawled over the smooth cowling. The throbbing of the powerful machine made a fearsome growl in the hold of the spaceship, but was drowned out by the panicked beating of her heart. She looked up at the swarthy man towering over her.</em></p><p><em>Her inborn dignity and pride had vanished when he’d chained her to the floor, and now she could only look up at him in misery as he slowly unzipped his pants. His mouth curled into a sneer, and tears sprang from her eyes, falling down her inviting cleavage to sizzle on the engine below.</em></p><p><em>The mask had been polished to a mirror finish, and reflected her agonized face back at her. The Baron was human, she could tell from his nude body, his powerful muscles rippling under a layer of sweat from the jungle planet’s sweltering heat.</em></p><p><em>But the mind behind the mask was alien, a twisted mass of lusts no more human than a fungus. That much she knew from the orders he’d given her… the things he made her do…</em></p><p> </p>",

Along the coast, small villages huddle quietly in the night, trusting the winter months to keep the inhabitants safe from harm.</em></p><p><em>The few barbarian raiders which infest the land keep to themselves in the cold seasons. Life is hard enough, and even thieves and cutthroats struggle to keep warm until the distant spring. Vikings are a different breed though, and thrive in the biting winter gales.</em></p><p><em>\"The suffering of Women captured in a raid doesn’t stop once their bodies have been<br /> defiled and wombs filled with their captors foreign seed. Some are used as guides,<br /> directing their tormentors to undefended villages. Forced to lead the violent<br /> invaders to their homes, they watch helplessly as their kin are captured as<br /> slaves or slaughtered without pity.\"</em></p><p><em>Any helpless women unlucky enough to be captured by the burly heathens is ripped from her home and shipped back to their harsh country. Women don’t last long in the craggy deathlands of the north, and fresh, shapely beauties are always in demand to warm beds and satisfy aching Viking balls!</em></p><p><em>\"Onward, you weak willed cunts! Thank the gods you’ve brought treasures<br /> from your homes. they’ll pay for the cost of your voyage!\"\"The naked young women throw their weight against the yoke, but their numb<br /> feet slide backward across the frozen ground. The wagon groans under the<br /> weight of their possessions. Anything of value has been plundered, and what<br /> couldn’t be taken has been burned. The Vikings have left nothing behind but<br /> charred bodies and families who can only pray for their missing daughters.\"</em></p><p><em>Mary’s head whipped back as the Viking pulled on the long tresses of her raven-dark hair.</em></p><p><em>An iron-shod boot struck out and clipped the back of her knees, forcing the struggling woman to the ground. She clutched the frayed tatters of her nightdress around her buxom figure, and looked up at the savage men who towered over her. In the wavering torchlight she heard babbled pleas for mercy, and recognized the voice as her own.</em></p><p><em>“Please,” she wailed, “don’t hurt me! Take any treasures you want. Gold for your captain and brandy for your bellies. Just leave me and my daughters in peace!”</em></p><p><em>Their red-rimmed eyes grew wide with lust before Mary realized her mistake. They would take everything she owned right in front of her, including her daughters!</em></p><p><em>\"All the things of their childhood are reduced to ash before their eyes,<br /> and the wooden gags muffle their sobs of despair. The frost-tinged wind<br /> whips over their skin, and they shudder in cold and misery.\"\"P-please, sir... take anything you want.. but leave my sisters and mother alone...<br /> I won’t resist.. -sob!- have mercy on us!\"</em></p><p><em>Her daughters were bound cruelly in front of the Vikings. They pawed the young woman’s naked bodies, pinching their tender flesh and making them wiggle and scream behind the gags which stretched their mouths open invitingly.</em></p><p><em>Mary cried in horror at seeing them being displayed to the shaggy men, and wept with impotent rage.</em></p><p><em>She couldn’t protect them from the violent men which had raided her home and taken everything of value. They’d plundered the castle and now were going to do the same to her!</em></p><p><em>The man’s slimy tongue licked the tears from her face, and covered her cheeks with a thick trail of saliva. She recoiled from his touch, but the heavy bonds held her in place.</em></p><p><em>His grasping hands slid down her smooth belly and cupped her womanhood possessively. “This is mine,” he said. “Everything here belongs to my clan including your hot slit, bitch!”</em></p>",

Beautiful Vicki Redfern, a fresh-faced 18 year old girl from the states had come to the country to make a name and a career for herself, but neither mother nor daughter expected the horrible hell that would follow!</em></p><p><em>A cruel, tattooed Latino by the name of Gustavo had his eye on Vicki from day one, and when the willful girl refused his advances, he decided to call in his mommy. Unfortunately for Claire and Vicki Redfern, Gustavo’s mommy was one of the cruelest and most sadistic prison wardens in the entire country – a vicious lesbian who went by the name of Mistress Melanie! Vicki Redfern was captured under false pretenses and brought to the F.S.C.C. – the Foreign Sluts Correctional Center!</em></p><p><em>Desperate to save her daughter, Claire Redfern went all the way to the top... to Colonel Chavez himself. This proved to be an enormous mistake, one that Claire Redfern is now deeply regretting!</em></p><p><em>Life within the prison walls of the F.S.C.C. is worse than Claire Redfern could even imagine in her darkest nightmares. Beholden to the whims of her cruel captors, she is forced to humiliate and degrade herself for the pleasure of the male and female guards who own her completely, all in the hopes of saving her daughter from an even worse fate!</em></p><p><em>Miss Claire Redfern is forced to submit herself to the will of a sadistic, lesbian mistress and to please her mistress with every hole she has!</em></p><p><em>Claire is shocked at the extent to which the F.S.C.C. has embedded itself into this South American country. She is given a small tour of the facility and is horrified to see that there are other white, innocent, helpless girls who are brutalized, used, and abused by the prison staff in the most unimaginably awful ways!</em></p><p><em>Claire will be made to drag herself through the mud as she struggles desperately to save her daughter and herself from the cruel hands of Mistress Melanie and the wicked Gustavo!</em></p><p><em>Things only get worse from there as the two American beauties are taken to the country estate of Colonel Chavez himself! Colonel Chavez remembers Claire Redfern and remembers how she spurned him earlier, back when she was nothing more than a well-dressed slut in a powersuit. He, most of all, is glad to see the proud woman brought down a peg... or two... or three.</em></p><p><em>Will these women escape the hell of a vicious, misogynistic South American dictatorship? Will they finally find safety and salvation in a visiting, American businessman?</em></p><p><em>Or will things get worse... much, much worse?!</em></p><p> </p>",

They had been working among the poor, helping many of them to cross the border and escape from the cruel dictatorship of Coronel Cisneros... Mary Ann suspects that things are going very wrong when the guards at the checkpoint rip her blouse open and take her bra off, revealing her magnificent breasts...</em></p><p><em>The Rev. Stevenson is taken away and charged with treason, for which there is the death penalty. Mary Ann has no choice. To keep her husband alive, she must cooperate. She is taken to the female prison, known as the FSCC (Foreign Sluts Correctional Centre), and is welcomed by the woman who runs it, a cruel lesbian known as Miss Melanie. Mary Ann is taken away for her first session of correctional treatment. She is tied to a table and abused by a group of soldiers as well as by Miss Melanie herself and her idiot son Gustavo...</em></p><p><em>One day the military come to inspect the girls’ progress. An exhibition is laid on for them, in which Vicky, the daughter of a foreign aid worker Claire Redfern, puts the girls through their paces. There is not a soft member in the military junta as the girls are forced to exhibit the most intimate parts of their naked bodies...</em></p><p><em>Vicky has gradually come under Miss Melanie’s influence and will do everything her mistress tells her to. Her mother Claire watches helpless as her daughter puts the girls through her paces. Is Vicky doing it because she has to, or because she wants to?</em></p><p><em>The mother watches in horror as the daughter takes the girls to the brink of orgasm again and again and then denies them the relief their bodies so badly need...</em></p><p> </p><p><em>When the show is over, the girls walk over to meet the members of the junta and offer them their mouths...</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Humiliation, public and private, is the key word.

Her parents going away for the weekend sounded like the perfect setup for a house-rocking party with her friends. But now she’s stuck babysitting her blonde sister while they’re away?</em></p><p><em>That’s so unfair!</em></p><p><em>She loves Dana, everyone does. But does that doesn’t mean she wants to spend the next two days stuck at home with no one to party with but her sister! Maybe that nice guy next door can come over and hang out. He’s always seemed so friendly…</em></p><p><em>Dana could feel Keith’s eyes on her shapely ass as she walked down the street. She laughed silently to herself and added an extra swivel to her hips as she walked before him.</em></p><p><em>Did he think he actually had a chance with her? HA!</em></p><p><em>Keith was a nice guy and had a great body, but he was just… Keith. She was used to seeing him around the neighborhood just like she was used to seeing the streetlight in front of her house or the fireplug on the corner. Her full lips curled into a teasing smile.</em></p><p><em>Sorry buddy, she thought, you’re a nice guy but you know what they say. Nice guys finish last! She gave an extra wiggle to her hips and kept walking.</em></p><p><em>The rope digging into her shaved crotch felt like it was slicing her in two! She bit down hard on the suffocating dildo gagging her and tried to raise herself up on the manacles which were spring bolted to the ceiling. Sweat broke out on her forehead as her long legs strained to lift her higher. Where was she? Her mind whirled in red haze of agony.</em></p><p><em>She had walked into Keith’s house and then felt him lunge at her from behind, covering her nose and mouth with a strange smelling cloth. After that, nothing until she woke up in this hellish cell. Her breath came in ragged gasps. Her hands were slipping! She moaned in horror as she slid down the rope, its coils burning across her raw slit!</em></p><p><em>Willis shot a wolfish grin at the trembling brunette. His coal black eyes widened in sick lust and anticipation.</em></p><p><em>She mewed like a kitten behind her gag and scrambled to get further away from him, but the chains clamped around her legs immobilized her. He grabbed at her beasts through the bars of the cell. Squealing in fear she thrashed against the restraints, causing Holly and Dana to scream in a chorus of terror. Oh yes, he’d enjoy breaking this tasty wildcat!</em></p><p> </p>",

The teenage beauties are taken far off the beaten trail where inbred, insular rednecks lurk.

They don’t like these gentrified, city slicker ways, and they have their own nasty, perverted ideas of how women ought to be treated!

    "description": "<p><em>Deep in the swamp, Wilbur and Bubba have broken in their newest pets and taught them how to behave like good girls. But that’s not enough for these bondage obsessed brothers. They want to make their acquisition official, and that means bringing in a backwater preacher to make sure the girls and boys are wed together in holy matrimony…</em></p><p><em>Unholy matrimony is more like it! What kind of preacher has prison tattoos and a missing finger? Even worse, he talks like a zealot and has the gaze of a crazed madman, a cruel psychopath. He wants to make sure the girls meet his sick standards of womanly virtue… whether they are submissive enough to the orders of their masters… whether they love to take cock in all their holes… and whether they are secret, lesbian sluts! This “preacher” will put the girls through their paces. Whether the girls will survive his religious rituals is another matter…</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile, Mrs. Taylor is still caught in the vicelike grip of the Mugshot family and friends. Keith, Mrs. Mugshot, and retarded brother Chuck have their fun while the Mexican Lupe and black Willis watch with eager, horny eyes. Mrs. Taylor is still full of spirit and frantic to escape. She has to find her daughters! Thanks to a slip of the tongue, retarded brother Chuck let loose that the girls had escaped, and she intends to make good on her own attempt… but there’s no promise that she’ll find help anywhere else in this redneck backwater world… out of the frying pan and into the fire… things may have been bad as a sex pet in the Mugshot’s basement, but things might be even worse in the “town” she finds herself in…</em></p><p><em>Things aren’t looking good for the Taylors! What kind of horrible atrocities will they have to endure? What kind of sick, sexual lusts will they have to satisfy? Will they survive, and if they do, will they still be the same innocent, sweet girls who first entered this nightmarish world?</em></p><p><em>All that and more will be revealed in this exciting new issue. You don’t want to miss this continuation of redneck roughhousing, the Hotties Next Door epic, brought to you here exclusively at Dofantasy.com!</em></p><p> </p>",

Based on the French novel, <strong>Le Roman de Boddah</strong> by <strong>Heloise Guay de Bellissen</strong>, this adaptation—a work of fiction—recounts real-life events from Cobain’s life, as narrated by his childhood imaginary friend, Boddah.</em></p><p><em>Through the eyes of Boddah, readers get a front row seat to the highs and lows of one of music’s most influential voices like they’ve never experienced before. Trace the arc of modern rock’s greatest icon from the dark clubs of Seattle to the bright lights of the world stage… and all the angst, horror, and thrill that came with that ride in this captivating graphic tale.</em></p>",
