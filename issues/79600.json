    "description": "<p>The TMNT are enjoying Donatello's latest creation - a sewer hot tub. April decides that bathing in warm sewer water isn't anything that she's interested in doing and heads off to stand watch. Raph explains that Cudley the Cowlick brought him home after his outer space adventure with the Mighty Mutanimals.<br />Meanwhile, in Dimension X, Krang discovers an unexpected ally on Morbus, the garbage world where he'd been banished to by Cherubae.<br />Back on Earth, April discovers an approaching intruder - who turns out to be Master Splinter. The Sensei tells O'Neil that it's time for her next lesson, and he admonsihes the TMNT. Splinter's not happy that his four mutant students are lounging about. The riled rodent orders the Turtles to get busy finding the Shredder before anything else terrible happens. Raph is happy to be proactive, but the Sensei reminds him that he needs to work with his brothers rather than on his own.<br />Slash demands that Krang help him find his palm tree - or die! The brainy alien quickly surmises the circumstances and promises to take Slash to a world filled with palm trees, and thus Krang has found his next minion. The two set off together and Slash explains that he was sentenced to a prison term on Morbus - as many other unsavory characters have been. The toxicity of the place usually kills prisoners, but some can survive in the environment.<br />As the Turtles transverse the sewers, they come upon a group of men who are assembling a bazooka.<br />Back on Morbus, Slash and Krang spot a landing spacecraft. As the villains close to investigate, two armed guards escort a chained prisoner named Bellybomb off the ship. The guards read Bellybomb's long list of offenses and ask him if he has any last words before they abandom him on the toxic planet, to which the cosmic criminal replies, \"You neglected to mention my unpaid parking tickets.\" Krang is most impressed with the toothy alien.<br />The TMNT discover that the men in the sewer plan to use the bazooka to fire a missile through the street and into an armored car's vulnerable underside. The Turtles launch an attack on the would-be thieves.<br />Slash attacks the guards holding Bellybomb and the two criminals charge into the ship to battle the remaining law men. Krang looks on happily and as he crawls towards the craft, decides that it's time to find a new body.<br />The Turtles easily defeat the well-armed bandits and tie them up, while the villains in Dimension X commandeer the prison ship and set a course for Earth. </p>",

The deadly duo then make their way to the zoo, where they apparently begin to fire their weapons upon caged animals.</p><p>Meanwhile, the TMNT are facing their worst (and weirdest) foe yet - the head of Krang on the body of Shredder! With little time to spend gawking at this oddity, the TMNT brace themselves for another attack by Slash, Bellybomb and the Krang-Shredder monstrocity. Early on, Raph entices Slash to run off in search of his palm tree, making the odds better for our heroes. Shortly, Slash finds a pet store and breaks the window to gleefully steal a small plastic palm tree.</p><p>Eventually the Turtles' teamwork enables them to get the upper hand in the fight. Raph rips Krang off of Shredder's body, while Mikey twirls his nunchukus and forces Bellybomb to get a giant whiff of his own toxic breath, thus disabling their remaining adversaries. Just as the Green Team is ready to celebrate, Bebop and Rocksteady arrive with a huge array of animals that they've freed from the zoo and level their guns at the Turtles. The TMNT drop their weapons as Shredder awakes. Saki relunctantly states that the Turtles saved his life and dejectedly walks off, but before he gets too far, Leonardo reminds his old foe that he owes the Turtles now. With is head bowed, Saki replies, \"I know... I know.\" and disappears into the night.</p><p>Bebop and Rocksteady load the spaceship with their animal companions from the zoo, as well as Krang and Bellybomb, and head for outer space. The Turtles worry that both Shredder and Slash are on the loose again, and make their way back to the sewer.</p><p>Bebop and his partner drop Krang and Bellybomb back on the toxic waste planet before returning to the jungle world - which they've decided is home.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A spacecraft lands in the icy mountains of Tibet...<br />In New York City, Master Splinter settles down to meditate and rest. As the Sensei begins to dream, he finds himself in the mountains of Tibet and comes upon a Yeti named T'Pau. T'Pau tells Splinter that 3 of his associates have \"ceased to be\" around the same time that the snowman has had visions of a strange creature that he fears is up to no good. The Yeti asks Master Splinter to help him, before he too ceases to be.<br />Splinter awakes and tells the Turtles to prepare to leave. The Turtles are reluctant, as April is on her way over with pizza. The Sensei grows angry with his students, and as they make their peace, all five are suddenly transported to Tibet (just beore April arrives with the food).<br />Our heroes spot the cave entrance to T'Pau's home and climb the mountain to get there. Inside the cavern, they find the Yeti in the robotic grasp of a strange octopus-faced alien. The Turtles attack the intruder, but he has a staff that quickly disintigrates anyone who makes a move. Splinter is the first to go, followed by Raph, Don and Leo. Mikey manages to disarm the fishy faced foe, but the creature activates a device on its writst and both T'Pau and Mike vanish.<br />Later, Mike wakes up inside a room with T'Pau. The Turtles picks the lock on the door and the two head out to investigate. They find two guards, but Mike makes short work of them. Eventually the duo find a door and the ninja kicks it down, revealing the control center of the spacecraft. Inside are the alien, some guards, as well as Splinter, Don, Leo and Raph. The Sensei introduces the alien as Boss Salvage and he explains that he has only come to Earth to save the rare species before the planet is ruined by toxic waste. He's already collected the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot and a Merman and planned to save T'Pau as well. The Yeti becomes agitated and states that while things look bad for the Earth, there is still time to save it - and in fact, many people are working hard to do so. After the snowman's invigorating speech, Boss Salvage agrees that there is still hope.<br />Everyone says their goodbyes and T'Pau transports the TMNT and Splinter back to the sewer, where they enjoy some pizzas with April.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A chemical company in Innsmouth, Massachusetts is illegally dumping toxic waste by paying two men to load their truck full of the muck and pouring it out in the hilltowns of the state. The factory is also illegally burning waste, causing deadly dumes to rise out of their chimneys. An owl and a crow accidentally fly through the lethal steam and fall into the smokestack. Inside the facilities, a factory foreman trips over the truckers' cat and angrily tosses it into a vat of waste. All three animals are pumped out of the factory via a drainage pipe and arise in new mutated form - with a vendetta against humanity.</p><p>One year later, April is driving to Boston to write a story about toxic waste when her rental car gets a flat tire. O'Neil is in the middle of nowhere, but notices that Innsmouth should be within walking distance. After a very long trek, April is found by an Innsmouth police officer, who takes her to the station. The sheriff tells April that he'll have her car repaired, in th emeantime, she can grab a bite to eat at the local diner. As soon as April leaves, the lawman calls the restaurant and tells the waitress to \"take care\" of O'Neil. The woman slips something into the reporter's milkshake. When April gets up to leave the diner, she suddenly feels very ill and falls to her knees in tear-inducing pain. A teenage girl named Beth Ann shows up and helps April stand up, telling her that they have to go, before \"they\" show up. O'Neil is suspcious and heads off on her own, only to be grabbed by the sheriff, who tells her that she won't be permitted to leave. April runs off and soon has the entire town chasing her in eerie silence.</p><p>O'Neil manages to give her pursuers the slip and makes a call to the TMNT. Mikey answers the phone and thinks that it's a prank. As he hangs up, we see that April has been snatched out of the phone booth.</p><p>Master Splinter asks Mike who called, and he states that it was a prank asking for April. The guys remind him that no one knows that they're friends with the reporter and only April knows their phone number - so it had to be O'Neil on the phone! Mikey slaps his forehead in disgust as the TMNT pile into their van and race out to save April.</p><p>The Turtles make it to Innsmouth and find it quiet - oddly, people are walking the streets like zombies, taking no notice of the mutant teens. Beth Ann arrives and leads our heroes to an old house where April has been taken. The Turtle teens break into the abode just in time to stop the cat, owl and crow mutants from forcing April to drink some toxic waste. Raph sends the evil mutants flying with a kick and a battle breaks out. The TMNT vanquish their foes with ease, sending them flying out of a window. Mike apologizes to April for thinking her call was a prank, but the reporter is so thankful to see her friends that she doesn't mind. After the cheerful reunion, Beth Ann points out that the bad guys have flown the coop.</p><p>One week later, the factory has been closed down. April reports to the police chief that the mutants were created by illegal toxic waste. The three had been adding the same waste to the townspeople's food and water supplies, which put them into a zombie-like state and allowed the mutants to control them. The lawman thanks April for her help and April says goodbye to Beth Ann.</p><p>As April rides off in the Turtle van, we see the three shadowy forms of the evil mutants watching our heroes depart.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The issue opens with Splinter teaching the Turtles about Japanese mythology, where a male god named Izanagi is accompanied by a female god named Izanami, who watches as the male removes his eyes and creates the sun and the moon with them. Together, the two formed the Japanese islands.</p><p>The TMNT, Master Splinter and April have stowed away on a plane headed for the Land of the Rising Son. Leonardo asks April to reiterate her tale, and the reporter reluctantly agrees. O'Neil explains that she had been in Chinatown when she ran into Fu Sheng and Chu Hsi, and soon after ninjas had shown up and kidnapped Fu Sheng. Chu changed into the form of the Dragon and fought the ninjas, but they used a powder to knock him out and revert him to his human form - and then they took off with both Chu and Fu.</p><p>April and Splinter then began investigating Chinatown looking for clues, and eventually found some thugs involved in the kidnapping. When they began questioning one of the villains, strange ninjas dressed in white attacked them. April was shocked to discover that when the white ninjas were dealt a severe blow, they dissipated into a sorcerous vapor. After defeating the strange ninjas, the thug told April and the Sensei that Chu Hsi and Fu Sheng had been taken to Hiroshima, Japan. Just as her tale concludes, the plane begins its descent to the Japanese city.</p><p>Meanwhile, we see a youthful Japanese girl kidnapped by some ninjas garbed in black, who take her to a secret warehouse headquarters near the ocean. There, she meets a new villain, wearing a Samurai mask and calling himself Chien Khan. Khan states that the girl's soul will serve them well, when Fu Sheng interrupts and states that it is his soul that they seek. We then see that Chu is lying unconscious on a table, and Chien Khan states that he desires neither the old man's nor the young girl's soul - but that of the Warrior Dragon that resides in Chu Hsi - and he intends to get it, with the assistance of Fu!</p><p>Meanwhile, the TMNT and April scam their way out of a jam at the airport by convincing the securtity guards that they're American actors in costume. One of the guards recognizes April as a famous reporter and escorts our heroes to their \"limousine.\" As soon as possible, everyone ducks into a sewer. Splinter announces that they'll need to look for clues topside once night falls, and the group heads to the east under the Sensei's orders. The TMNT are surprised to find that the sewers are newer than those of NYC, since they thought the Japanese city was older than their home, and Splinter explains that everything had to be rebuilt after the city was almost completely destroyed during World War II.</p><p>As they transverse the sewer, the group stumbles into a group of young men, who do not take kindly to the presence of our protagonists. Splinter attempts to negotiate a peaceful meeting...</p><p>Back at the docks, Chien Khan revels in his opportunity to appropriate the soul of the Warrior Dragon. The villain demands that Fu assist him and the old man refuses - until Khan threatens to kill the girl.</p><p>Unfortunately for the Turtles, as they try to negotiate safe passage through the sewer, a group of black-grabed ninjas attack the youths. Having started the fight, the ninja retreat to leave the battle to be fought between the TMNT and the young men, who think that the Turtles are \"oni\" (demons). The TMNT win the fight and move on, as there's no sight of the ninjas who had begun the struggle. Splinter states that they will go to the Peace Memorial at the heart of Hiroshima - the Sensei's comments are overheard by one of the ninjas, and he retreats to Chien Khan's headquarters and tells him the news. Khan tells Fu Sheng that his friends have arrived to try to help him - so the masked villain sends his most trusted warrior to defeat the Turtles - the fox named Ninjara.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Man Ray, Jagwar, Dreadmon, Mondo Gecko, Wingnut and Screwloose have been knocked unconscious by a group of skeletal robots controlled by the evil corporate weasel, Mr. Null - the devilsih dude hellbent on ruling the universe. Leatherhead and a shape-shifter named Azrael are still standing, but the gatorman's gun runs out of ammo and he is overpowered by the cybernetic psychos. Azrael changes into an eagle and escapes.</p><p>Before Null can kidnap the Mutanimals, the TMNT, Ninjara and Splinter show up and the fight is renewed. A laser beam that Leo deflects with his swords nicks Man Ray's shoulder which awakens the mutant and he joins the fray. Eventually all of the Mutanimals recover and battle escalates. As laser beams and robot body parts fly, Null manages to capture Azrael when she returns to human form and punches her in the face. Null then carries the unconscious woman through a secret doorway hidden in the nearby rocky hills.</p><p>Mr. Null meets with four shadowy figures, the foremost looking like the Grim Reaper, who states that the group is ready.</p><p>Meanwhile, with the help of the Turtles, the Mutanimals finish mopping up the Robo-Skeletons. As the group exchanges greetings, Jagwar notes that Azrael is missing. Leonardo points out that Cudley is also gone and wonders if they're together, but Dreadmon states that he saw Azrael flying off in her eagle form.</p><p>Man Ray then explains that the Mutanimals have come to this place to search for Jagwar's mother, Juntarra, who was kidnapped by the Grim Reaper. A nearby giant skull is where they believe the Reaper to be - but when they found it, Null's robots attacked them. Thus the fishy mutant surmises that Null is working with the Grim Reaper. Jagwar points out that the stoney desert they're now standing in was a lush tropical jungle before the Reaper arrived. Ninjara notices a fire in the jungle far off and everyone rushes to investigate.</p><p>When our heroes arrive, they discover four zombies with torches setting fire to the jungle. Jagwar and Dreamon destroy the monsters quickly. When the heroic mutants turn to look at the fire, four shadowy figures emerge from the flames...</p>",

    "description": "<p>The four shadowy figures ended up being Death, Famine, War and Pestilence - evil forces of nature who have allied themselves with Null and defeated our heroes. As this issue opens, Null has the TMNT and Mutanimals shackled to posts. Jagwar demands to know why Null has destroyed the rain forest and kidnapped his mother. The evil corporate devil explains that he did it to make the Earth inhospitable to all life.</p><p>Splinter asks Null what he plans to do with his captives and the villain explains that they will all be slowly electrocuted to death on the posts. Ninjara snarls for him to get it over with, but Null delays and states that he will not be the one to push the button that begins the execution, he has someone else in mind for that task. The demon then he walks off to his hidden headquarters in the hills.</p><p>When Null gets to his destination, he discovers that both Azrael and Juntarra have escaped.</p><p>Azrael arrives at the spot where our heroes are tied and attacks the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In his efforts to capture the eagle, War crashes through the posts holding some of our heroes, freeing them. A battle ensues while Don quickly frees the others.</p><p>In the distance, the cowboy known as Kid Terra spies on the Reaper, who is controlling War, Famine and Pestilence by means of puppetry. Juntarra is with Kid - she runs off to help her son while Terra heads up the cliff where the Grim Reaper is preoccupied with the battle below. Kid Terra punches the bonehead, but Null arrives on the scene and shoots the cowboy, who falls from the top of the cliff to the ground below.</p><p>The battle between the mutants and the Horsemen continues, while the Reaper seizes the Kid's lifeless body.</p><p>Juntarra, Ninjara and Azrael corner Null - who freaks out when faced by three powerful women.</p><p>While the Reaper is preoccupied with the Kid's body, Screwloose finds the puppets that the deathly villain was using to control the other Horsemen. Screwloose grabs the puppets and smashes them on a rock - causing the real monsters to disappear into thin air!</p><p>Null pulls a gun and keeps his adversaries at bay, before sprouting bat wings and escaping.</p><p>Our heroes gather around the Grim Reaper as it holds Terra's body. Kid is having a vision about a hallway full of doors... he finds one cracked open, bright white light escaping from it. Kid opens the door...</p><p>The Reaper laughs with satisfaction and holds a glowing orb high above his head, gloating that it has captured Kid Terra's soul. Juntarra grabs the Reaper's scythe and smashes the skeleton to bits - Azrael leaps and catches the Kid's soul and places it on his head, where it seeps back into his body. Once he's absorbed his soul, Kid Terra stirs back to life!</p><p>The Reaper's bones turn to dust and Kid asks someone to remove the bullet from his chest - Raph states that he can do it with the right implements.</p><p>Jagwar is finally reunited with his mother.</p><p>Mondo comments, \"After all this, I can only say one thing... WHEW!\"</p><p>Off in the distance, the Grim Reaper's dust reforms into its skeletal form and rides off on its horse.</p><p>Later, Kid Terra peacefully recovers from his impromptu surgery as the Turtles wonder where Cudley the Cowlick could be.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The issue begins with Master Splinter recounting his first hand experience witnessing the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima back in 1945 (Note: TMNT Adventures utilizes the same origin for Splinter that was used in the cartoon, in that he was once a man named Hamato Yoshi as opposed to being the pet rat of Yoshi, as he was in the original comic book from Mirage). Our heroes have arrived at the Industrial Exhibition Hall, one of the few structures that withstood the force of the blast. It has been left in its decimated state to remind everyone of the horrors of war. Splinter reveals that this is the first time that he has seen the building since that fateful day in 1945.</p><p>The Sensei is interrupted as Ninjara arrives on the scene and a battle erupts between the TMNT and her sorcerous white ninja forces.</p><p>Back at the docks, Fu Sheng agrees to help Chien Khan if he promises not to harm the girl. The Khan agrees and then states that it has taken Ninjara many years to steal all of the artificats required to perform the ritual.</p><p>The Turtles continue to battle Ninjara as Fu Sheng prepares the transformation powder for Khan. The Warrior Dragon is released and is now under the control of Chien Khan, who sends him on a mission.</p><p>The TMNT are fairing well in the battle when the Warrior Dragon arrives on the scene. The Turtles notice that something is wrong with their friednd, so they hop on board to see what he's up to. Ninjara also manages to climb onto the Dragon, as she threatens to cut out Raph's heart.</p><p>At the warehouse, Fu Sheng admonishes and uncaring Chien Khan for ordering the Dragon to destroy a nearby nuclear power plant and use its power to open a gateway to a world of demons.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Chien Khan negotiates with a demon lord named Noi Tai Dar. Khan offers the souls of all mankind to the hellspawn, as he seeks vengeance against humanity and wishes to see them destroyed. Noi Tai Dar states that if Chien Khan will open a doorway for him, he will see it done. To open the passage, Khan must sacrifice a life and the Warrior Dragon must unleash the power of the nuclear power plant.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dragon, under the control of Khan, begins to destroy the nuclear power plant. The TMNT attack their friend to try to stop him, to no avail. Ninjara is enraged when she discovers that the Warrior Dragon has been ordered to destroy the power plant - she is disgusted that Chien Khan would allow more radiation to foul Japan considering the bombing in 1945.</p><p>Chien Khan prepares the young girl for sacrifice while the damaged nuclear power plant opens the gateway for the massive demon. The hellspawn attacks the Dragon, who comes to his senses after being blasted by a bolt of energy. The mighty Warrior is dismayed at what his actions have caused.</p><p>Master Splinter tries to meditate to find a solution to their enormous problem as the Warrior Dragon attacks the demon. The Sensei notes that he feels another great presence nearby...</p><p>Leo asks Ninjara what Chien Khan has planned, and she reveals that the summoning requires both a power source and a sacrifice. Apparently Khan hasn't performed the sacrifice yet, as Noi Tai Dar is still tied to his power source - but once Khan completes his part of the ritual, the demon will be free to destroy all humanity. Leo determines that since the demon is too powerful for them to fight, they must stop Khan from making his sacrifice. Ninjara states that his headquarters are far from where they are, and Leonardo tells her that gives them all the more reason to hurry.</p><p>Master Splinter stays in his meditative state, noting that the spirits are coming closer... behind him, two gigantic forms begin to appear in the sky... it's none other than the gods, Izanagi and Izanami!</p><p>Fu Sheng breaks free of his bounds and smashes into Chien Khan, preventing him from sacrificing the girl.</p><p>Izanagi blasts Noi Tai Dar with a beam of light from his eyes and destroys the demon.</p><p>Chien Khan's helmet is knocked off by Fu Sheng's attack - revealing Khan to be a dog-faced man! Chien punches a shocked Fu Sheng in the face and then returns to his sacrifice, but the TMNT and Ninjara arrive in time to stop him. Khan is livid and calls Ninjara a traitor before ordering his henchmen to kill our heroes - but the villains are no much for the Turtles and their new foxy ally. Suddenly, the roof of the building is ripped apart by the Warrior Dragon, who has returned to save his friend Fu Sheng. The old man is fine, but Chien uses the distraction to strike Ninjara and make his escape.</p><p>Raph helps Ninjara to her feet, and everyone breathes a sigh of relief for another hard fought victory.</p>",

    "description": "<p>After the struggle against the demon Noi Tai Dar, our heroes seek activities to soothe their souls.<br />Leonardo and Master Splinter train on a hillside. The Sensei explains to Leonardo that a true swordsman must empty his mind of all thought when doing battle - there must only be flow, the swordsman must become one with his blade. Splinter has little trouble disarming and defeating his student, and Leonardo tries to take in the lesson before the two break for lunch.<br />The pair join the other Turtles, Fu Sheng, Chu Hsi, April, Ninjara and the girl Chien Khan kidnapped in the previous issue for some sushi. Raph isn't happy about the menu, and Ninjara needles him by saying \"I thought you weren't afraid of anything!\"<br />Leo notes that Japan is where all of their lives began - it is the home of Master Splinter as well as the Foot Clan. The Sensei agrees, and asks his students to explore their homeland, so that they can better understand their teachings and origins. The Turtles eagerly agree and ask where to begin, and Splinter tells them to first separate from one another. Mike joins the girl and the two head off to fly a kite. Ninjara takes Raphael to visit some stone monuments. Donatello decides to check on how the containment process is going at the nuclear power plant - but he chooses to go alone. Splinter asks Leo to continue his lessons. Fu Sheng is left alone, as April and Chu are wrapped in conversation.<br />Ninjara and Raphael arrive at the shrine. The Turtle wonders why there are so many crows around, and the fox explains that they are probably drawn to the dark power contained in the Torii. Raph asks if these monuments are really a gateway to a dimension filled with demons, and Ninjara assures him that it is true - the Torii are a gateway to the Yomi, or Underworld or \"Land of Gloom.\" Raph feels compelled by the Torii and Ninjara warns him to be careful, as they contain mesmerizing power over those who are open to it. The Turtle begins to stutter and Ninjara orders him to \"Let it go!\" in the nick of time. Shaken, Raph leans on the fox for support and thanks her for her help. Ninjara notes that Raph has an affinity to the Torii, and she tells him that she likes that. Suddenly, the foxy ninja smells something on the wind... cologne? We see four human figures hidden in shadows, spying on the mutants.<br />Donatello is watching helicopters pouring cement on the nuclear power plant. The men are burying the radioactive plant in concrete, the same way that Chernobyl was sealed. Don finds the solution somewhat pedestrian, but is impressed by the engineering involved. His thoughts are interrupted as two crows fly by - and then a strange white energy ball forms in front of the mutant. Donatello wonders if it's an after effect of the demon's sorcery, or of the radiation.<br />Leo and Splinter continue to train, but once again Leonardo is unarmed. Splinter reminds him, \"Be one with your sword, Leonardo.\" The Turtle thanks his mentor and the teacher thanks his student as the sun begins to set.<br />Mikey and his friend exchange haikus as they fly a large kite decorated with a yellow dragon.<br />Feng Shu trains Chu Hsi to control the spirit of the Warrior Dragon while April practices with her katana. After a time, Chu manages to shrink the gigantic form of the Warrior Dragon down to his normal height. April is impressed.<br />Ninjara and Raph attack the people spying on them - it's the gang of youths from the sewer fight! Raph states that they mistakenly thought the Turtles were allied with Chien Khan's ninjas, and one of the men incredulously declares, \"Mistakenly?! Yet you keep company with the greatest thief in Japan?!\"<br />Donatello watches the energy ball as it transforms into the Yin Yang symbol and speaks to him, explaining that it is all things feminine as well as all things masculine - for it is the Tao. Don is bewildered at first, but then smiles and introduces himself. The Yin Yang asks Donatello to follow it, and it leads him up a mountain. Once he reaches the top, Donatello can see that the men have finished filling in the damaged nuclear power plant, and the concrete forms the Yin Yang symbol.<br />\"There is ebb, there is flow,\" the symbol explains, \"There is give, there is take. Every saving has its cost. Tao is all.\" And with that, the Yin Yang symbol disappears.<br />Raph and Ninjara put the finishing moves on their opponents. Raph wonders aloud why the men attacked them, and the last one standing notes, \"It was you who attacked us! We came seeking...<br />April and Chu share a kiss by the moonlight. April breaks away and says that they need to slow down, and Chu agrees. He takes O'Neil by the hand and the pair head off to join Fu Sheng for dinner.<br />Leonardo and Master Splinter continue their training. The pair lunge at one another, and both their blades shatter upon impact. </p>",

On cue, the mighty Sumo wrestler named Tattoo arrives and tells the Turtles that his pet chihuahua, Inky, has been taken hostage. The mob has threatened to kill the massive man's best friend if he doesn't take a fall in his next match - Tattoo states that he can't lose the match as it will ruin his career. The TMNT vow to help him get his pooch back without having to throw the match.</p><p>While Tattoo is engaged in his Sumo match, the TMNT, Ninjara and the Warrior Dragon infiltrate the mob headquarters and rescue the fiesty pup. Tattoo wins his match and the Turtles return Inky to his beloved master. The wrestler awards Leonardo a katana as thanks for saving his dog.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Master Splinter, Ninjara and the TMNT have traveled the globe to visit the Sensei's old teacher, Charlie Llama, in the Crystal Palace in Tibet. On their way they met a four armed tiger man named Katmandu who was on his way to the Palace to guard the Llama. Unfortunately, upon their arrival, our heroes find the palace in shambles - and a four armed skeleton escapes their grasp.</p><p>As Katmandu and Leo ponder where the skeleton may have gone, a young pregnant woman named Jang La explains that she has come to the palace in order that Charlie Llama (the fourteenth reincarnation of the Buddha) can serve as her midwife during the birth of her child. She also points out a distant palace among the mountains that the Dervish skeleton has escaped to.</p><p>Katmandu explains that this building is the home of the evil sorceror Mang-Thrasha. Typically, the wizard does not involve himself in the lives of men - so the tiger warrior is surprised that he has kidnapped Charlie Llama. As the protaganists decide what course of action to take against Mang-Thrasha, Jang La suddenly goes into labor. The TMNT take her back inside the Crystal Palace and make her as comfortable as possible. Soon, a group of monkey monks called the Tantric Monkeys arrive. Leo, Mike, Raph, Ninjara and Katmandu leave for Mang-Thrasha's palace as Master Splinter, Don and the Tantric Monkeys help Jang La during her birthing.</p><p>The group of heroes arrive at the foot of the mountain holding the evil sorceror's palace and soon run into a strange mist. Raph and Ninjara are separated from the others due to the fog. Mike, Leo and Katmandu are attacked by two dervishes. Meanwhile, Raph and Ninjara spot the palace and begin to climb towards it - when the mutant turtle loses his grip and causes an avalanche that carries both ninjas down the mountain.</p><p>Leo, Mike and Katmandu discover the four armed skeleton Dervish in the mist and Katmandu makes short work of the bone brain. The trio heads into Mang-Thrasha's unlocked palace and find the wizard accompanied by a large Chinese militia. The sorceror states that he plans to ally himself with the Chinese and hand Charlie Llama over to them. The Chinese government will then force Charlie Llama to tell his millions of followers that he is not the Buddha and that his spiritual claims were all lies, thus ending the any threat that the Chinese might lose control of Tibet.</p><p>Suddenly, Raph and Ninjara come crashing through the wall and a battle ensues. While the Turtles and fox fight the militia, Katmandu rushes to Charlie Llama's side - but as he stands guard over his master, the Buddha dies comfortably on his bed, due to natural causes.</p><p>At that moment, Jang La has her baby, much to the delight of the Tantric Monkeys.</p><p>With the death of Charlie Llama, Mang-Thrasha's plans are ruined.</p><p>That evening, Charlie Llama is burned upon a funeral pyre. Ninjara laments for Splinter that he has traveled all this way to speak with his mentor, only to lose him upon arrival. Splinter smiles and states that while the Master he knew is gone, he will return later, when the new incarnation of the Buddha (Jang La's child) has grown up.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Continuing their journey, the Turtles, Ninjara and Master Splinter find themselves in the deserts of Iran, where they sneak aboard an oil freighter heading for Oman. Our heroes then cross the sands of Saudi Arabia, heading for Al Hadidah, which is nearby Mecca, where the legendary Black Stone is kept. Ninjara reveals that the Stone is highly prized by thieves, and it is said to be fifth most difficult item in the world to steal. When the group arrives in Al Hadidah, a large crater in the Earth's surface, they decide to camp for the evening. While they rest, Master Splinter tells them the history of the area and that of the Black Stone and its importance to the religion of Islam. Splinter also states that since they are so close, they must at least take a look at Mecca.</p><p>The next day the mutants ride out on camels, and Ninjara tells the tale of a second stone. According to legend, two stones fell - the Black Stone, as well as a White Stone. Reportedly a nomad disappeared with the White Stone before anyone else arrived on the scene. Supposedly wealthy men have been selling the stone for the past 3,000 years and have been trying to steal its Black twin - as legend has it that the man who holds both Stones will live forever.</p><p>The protaganists pass by another caravan of six camel riders. Pleasant greetings are exchanged and the groups continue on their separate ways - although one of the other riders seemed to recognize Splinter...</p><p>Later, the TMNT find an abandoned city, long ago forgotten when the trade routes changed. The team takes shelter, as a huge sandstorm looms on the horizon. Unbeknownst to them, a falcon has taken news of their arrival to an unsual eagle-headed mutant, who resides nearby.</p><p>Back at the abandoned city, the Turtles are attacked by a group of men. As they fight, the eagle-headed mutant flies into the fray and smashes into Michaelangelo. We discover that this new threat goes by the name Al 'Falqa, and he's under the impression that our heroes have stolen the Black Stone of Mecca. The Turtles and Splinter manage to convince their flying foe that they have not taken the artifact. Al 'Falqa explains that he was sure they had taken the Stone, as it was reported that six riders had escaped with it. Suddenly, the sandstorm is upon them. Everyone tries to take cover, but Master Splinter is overcome by the force and passes out due to lack of oxygen.</p><p>From a distance, the Shredder watches the scene via his binoculars and laughs.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Once the sandstorm has passed, Shredder arrives on the scene and lifts the unconscious body of Splinter, cursing his existence. Ninjara, Al 'Falqa and the TMNT arrive and a battle breaks out, but our heroes are soon trapped inside a force field created by a new villain, the cat mutant cyborg from the future named Verminator-X!</p><p>Verminator-X kicks the force field bubble and sends our team rolling through the sand. The villains then climb onboard their camels and take Master Splinter with them as they ride off into the desert.</p><p>Several hours later, the force field finally collpases and frees our heroes. Al 'Falqa sends his falcon ally, Talyn, to find their foes. The bird soon finds Shredder and his new henchman. Verminator-X spots Talyn and fires, but his shot only wounds the bird rather than killing it.</p><p>Talyn tells Al 'Falqa that Shredder is camped at a nearby oasis, and the eagle mutant leads the Turtles through a foggara (an underground aqueduct) to the spot.</p><p>Verminator-X and Shredder are waiting for a time-slip portal to open, which will give them the means to escape with their prize - the stolen Black Stone of Mecca.</p><p>The Turtles discover Foot Robot guards and attack, while Ninjara and Al 'Falqa battle Shredder and Verminator-X. The TMNT mop up the Foot bots with little trouble, but they soon find Master Splinter held hostage by Verminator-X and their arch enemy. Leonardo reminds Shredder that he owes the Turtles for freeing him from Krang. Shredder reluctantly turns the Sensei over to the TMNT, just as the time slip opens and the villains escape with the Black Stone...</p><p>Except they didn't escape with the Stone! Ninjara had used her thieving skills to replace the Black Stone with a fake while Al 'Falqa kept the criminals busy. The mighty eagle mutant is overcome with gratitude and kneels in praise with the real Black Stone of Mecca.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Our heroes continue to cross the desert when their old acquaintance Cudley the Cowlick arrives and informs them that Mr. Stump, head of the Intergalactic Wrestling Federation, wants them to appear on his show again. The Turtles are so tired of walking the desert that they agree to have Cudley take them across the galaxy to Stump's asteroid to see what he has to offer. Master Splinter isn't happy that they've cut their tour of the world short.</p><p>Upon their arrival, Stump tells the TMNT that he wants them to take part in his wrestling tournament. If they agree, Cudley will take them anywhere and anytime in the universe as payment. Donatello angrily notes that all they'll be getting for their appearance is a ride home, a fact that Stump acknowledges. Master Splinter points out that the Turtles had agreed to come here, so if they want a ride home...</p><p>The TMNT head to the locker room to don their wrestling costumes, where they meet Cryin' Houn', Ace Duck and Trap. Trap informs the mutant dudes that Stump has decided that this time, since it's a tournament, they'll have to wrestle each other! The winner of the tournament will then have to take on El Mysterio for the title.</p><p>As Ace Duck begins the tournament against a werewolf named Bloodbath, Master Splinter and Ninjara discuss her relationship with Raphael. The Sensei admits that while he intitially didn't trust her due to her partnership with Chien Khan, he has come to trust her completely - but it is difficult for him to accept her relationship with Raph, as it means that his sons are growing up. Ninjara hugs Splinter as they view the beauty of outer space through a gigantic window.</p><p>At this point, the main event begins - the TMNT in a free-for-all against one another. After a long bout, Donatello finally manages to pin Raphael and win the match. El Mysterio (Cryin' Houn' in a costume) arrives in the ring, but Don is too quick for the lumbering four-armed wrestler and quickly pins him as well. Donatello is declared the winner and receives a kiss from the ring girl.</p><p>Soon, Cudley is flying through space, carrying our heroes home.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The TMNT, Ninjara and Master Splinter set sail for home when they're met by a terrific storm that capsizes their tiny craft and washes them ashore a nearby island. When our heroes awake, they're welcomed by local natives who think the mutants are emissaries of the ocean god.</p><p>Then, much to the Turtles' surprise, Christopher Columbus and his soldiers arrive. The invaders surround our heroes while Columbus congratulates himself for discovering a new route from the west to the east. The captain orders one of the Turtles to be separated from the rest and taken to his ship - Donatello is chosen.</p><p>Later that night, Don is awakened by Columbus, who explains that he's seeking enough gold to recover Jerusalem, his personal crusade.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the beach, Columbus' soldiers begin to assault the local women, and the Turtles leap into action. The mutants make short work of the soldiers and head out to rescue Donatello.</p><p>On the ship, Donatello meets a strange creature, an Earth spirit called the Other. The Other explains that the TMNT had arrived on this spot exactly 500 years after Columbus had done the same. The locale is one of Earth's \"power spots,\" where the sacred energy of the planet collects. So the Turtles' arrival on the Power Spot on such a historic anniversary has triggered a temporal overlapping, causing the mutants to travel back in time to witness Columbus' arrival.</p><p>The Other also explains how the \"discovery\" of the \"new world\" lead to fiasco for the native inhabitants of the land, from killer disease to enslavement. The Earth spirit then hands Don his bo staff and disappears, just as Mikey arrives. The borthers hug and then make their escape - a huge storm has arrived once again, and everyone jumps into the sea.</p><p>The next morning, Donatello awakes to find a cruise ship anchored offshore. Our heroes get on board the craft, which carries them back to New York City.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As Ninjara and Raph head back to the sewers, the foxy ninja sees a sign advertising a mastadon exhibit at the Museum of Natural History. The image reminds Raphael of a story, which he relates to his gal pal: April interviewed Dr. Selena Davis, curator of the Natural History Museum, regarding her controversial theory regarding her intent to create clones. Soon thereafter, a homeless man who had once been a great reporter investigates a stry about a monster, and discovers a mutant mammoth man! The beast roars at the fellow, who runs for his life. Moments later, the mutant collapses and dreams of how he had been frozen in ice thousands of years ago, only to be thawed by Shredder and turned into a monster - but befriended by four green turtle men. After an adventure with the TMNT, the mastadon dude had fallen into an icy river and was thought lost, but he had survived and remained hidden for months. Recovering from his flashback, the mammoth man then spots some life-sized dinosaur sculptures being hauled by a truck and sets off to follow them... \"home.\"</p><p>As it turns out, Dr. Davis had managed to get a strand of hair from the mammoth man from his earlier adventure - and has used it to create her own clone of the creature! As she and her two henchmen prepare to bring the clone to life, they see a news report regarding the \"riverfront monster\", none other than the original mastadon mutant himself. Davis sends her cronies out to retrieve the mammoth man. The two men have no trouble in luring the beastie to Davis' secret headquarters at the museum.</p><p>At the same time, April and the Turtles were discussing the possibilities of their strange friend surviving the icy waters when the news report came in, and the ninjas head out to investigate. After a long search, all they manage to find is a clump of hair, which they take back to their lair so Don can analyze it. Mikey sees a TV ad for the dinosaur exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum and jokes that perhaps the mammoth dude has gone there to see the exhibit. Raph scoffs at him, but Donatello thinks Mikey is on to something, so the gang pile into their van and head off to the museum.</p><p>The Turtles break into the building and soon find their friend caged by Davis and her henchmen. The Turtles order the scientist to free their ally, but she orders her clone to attack and a battle ensues. Enraged, the original mastadon dude breaks the bars of his cage and clobbers his clone. Unfortunately the force of his attack causes the museum to buckle on its foundation and it begins to collapse. The TMNT and April make their escape in the nick of time.</p><p>Shortly, the original mammoth man digs out of the rubble, carrying Davis and her assistants. April finds a police officer, who doesn't know what to do - so O'Neil arranges for the mastadon dude to be shipped via boat to Arctic Island, where he will finally be truly at home.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The TMNT, Ninjara and Splinter are relaxing in the lair when an intruder arrives - a fox dude that turns out to be Ninjara's brother, Naga. The young fox states that he has come because Ninjara's grandmother has been captured by a hunter. Raph demands to know how the mutant found their secret lair, and Naga states that Ninjara gave him directions. This upsets Master Splinter and the TMNT, and Ninjara apologizes, saying that she only told her brother where she was. Raph isn't appeased by her apology, but before an argument can erupt, April suddenly appears on the TV giving a report about a giant, four armed creature attacking the city. The Turtles announce that they've got to investigate, but Ninjara states that she has to leave with her brother. Raph asks Splinter if he can accompany her, and the Sensei grants him permission and tells his student that he must release his anger concerning Ninjara giving away the address to their lair.</p><p>Of course, Raph doesn't do this. The three stow aboard a plane to Japan, and Raph badgers Ninjara about telling her borther the secret. Ninjara screams at him to shut up and the two fall into angry silence, leaving Naga to awkwardly try to make peace for the duration of the long, long flight. Once the trio lands, they take a boat to an island hidden by clouds, the home of Naga and Ninjara. The children welcome the foxy ninja home, but an Elder is not happy to see her because she has left her people. Kenji, Ninjara's old boyfriend, tells our heroes that the Council of Elders has decreed that no rescue will be attempted for Ninjara's grandmother.</p><p>The next morning, Raph, Ninjara and Naga set out on their own to rescue the foxes' grandmother. No sooner have they entered the forest when Ninjara and Raphael are ensnared by a trap net. Ninjara orders Naga to cut them free, but the youth reveals that he's made a deal with the hunter - he's offered the man Raphael in trade for his grandmother. The hunter arrives and decides that he will keep both Raph and Ninjara as his trophies. Naga tries to argue, but the hunter smashes him in the head with the butt of his rifle and then shots the netted Raphael with a tranquilizer.</p><p>Raph awakes in a cage next to Ninjara in the hunter's trophy room. Naga and his Grandmother are there as well, though they are not caged. The man gloats, which sends the Elder fox into a rage and she attacks. Naga uses the distraction to open the cages, and Raphael punches him in the face for betraying them. Ninjara notes that they can settle their dispute with her brother later, right now they need to escape. A fire bursts into life and the mutants head outside, where they find themselves stranded upon a high cliff. Grandmother explains that they'll have to escape via the Underworld - a place Raph is not interested in visiting, but a huge explosion rips out of the hunter's building as his ammunition begins to ignite. The blast convinces the Turtle that they'll have to go through the Torri gate to make their escape. Just then the hunter arrives and begins firing his pistol at our heroes. Raph is able to hold him off while the Elder fox opens the gateway to the Underworld. The four mutants jump through the portal, but the hunter chases them and manages to get through the gateway before it closes.</p><p>The five outworlders arrive in the Underworld and are welcomed by a demon, who tells them that they can leave via the Torri that they arrived in. The hunter makes a dash for the gate, but rather than passing though a portal to his dimension, he simply plunges through the framework and falls into the pit. The demon asks if she had forgotten to mention that it only works for the pure of heart. Grandmother decides to test if the demon is telling the truth, and walks through the Torri, vanishing. Naga is next, and he too disappears. Ninjara and Raph embrace, and then run to the Torri holding hands.</p><p>The couple pass thorugh the Torri and arrive on Ninjara's home island, where they are greeted by Grandmother and Naga. Ninjara compliments her kin on her fighting ability and Raphael makes peace with Naga.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Splinter meditates upon his life, from the time that he was a young man named Yoshi learning the martial arts from his Uncle Gyogi, to his years at Osaka University studying history and philosophy, to his life as a member of the Foot Clan. Eventually Yoshi left the Foot to continue his religious studies in Tibet, where for one year he was taught by the Charlie Llama. At the end of World War Two, Yoshi returned home and witnessed the atomic bomb being dropped on Japan. He managed to escape death and later rejoined the Foot, where he was framed for murder by none other than Oroku Saki, who desired Yoshi's position in the Clan.</p><p>Yoshi was cast out of the Foot Clan and traveled to America, where he took up residence in the sewers of New York City. Soon, he discovered four turtles in a green ooze and cleaned them up. That night, Yoshi transformed into the mutant rat we know as Master Splinter. As you know, the turtles also mutated. Splinter decided that since they would be outcasts from society, he must teach the turtles how to survive, thus he became their sensei and taught them ninjitsu.</p><p>Years later, Saki arrived in New York City with his branch of the Foot and began his criminal empire. Splinter decided that he and the Turtles must stop his old foe, and the battle was on.</p><p>After contemplating his past, the Sensei investigates a noise in the sewer and discovers that his students and Ninjara have prepared a birthday celebration for him.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The Titans search for a teenaged runaway who is mixed up in a smuggling ring, and also have to stop a biker gang from ruining a hippie gathering.</em></p><p>The Teen Titans arrive in Hippieville, U.S.A, in search of a runaway, named Ken Matthews. They consult with Eddie the Guru, who aids teens in assimilating into Hippie culture. Matthews is performing courier work with a shady character, known as Tram the Trucker. During one of Matthews' parcel drops, he is spied by a local beat cop, and flees the scene. The officer pursues Matthews, right to the Teen Titans. Kid Flash corrals Matthews, who expresses an anti-authority stance. Before Matthews can be questioned, Captain Rumble arrives. Captain Rumble hates the Hippies, and immediately incites his gang into carrying out violence against them. The Teen Titans quickly subdue Captain Rumble, and his thugs, but in the confusion, Matthews slips away. Matthews returns to his girlfriend, Karin.</p><p>Matthews, having failed to deliver the parcel, lands Tram the Trucker in trouble with his boss, Big Arnie. Tram the Trucker sends out his two henchmen, Ironhead and Buster, to round up Matthews. They find Matthews at his girlfriend's apartment. Karin drops an industrial mobile on the two goons, buying her and Matthews time to escape. The Teen Titans adopt Hippie attire, and code names, to better blend into Hippie culture. As Ironhead and Buster close in on Karin and Matthews, Wonder Girl intervenes. While Wonder Girl is occupied with beating down the two thugs, Karin and Matthews escape. Robin's Hippie disguise brings down the wrath of Captain Rumble's gang upon him. Robin easily subdues the two bikers, only to be run down by Captain Rumble. Using a string of beads, Robin lassoes, then pulls, Captain Rumble from his bike.</p><p>Ironhead and Buster, having recovered from their beating, once again close in on Matthews. This time, Kid Flash disables their truck, while rendering them unconscious. Matthews, again, slips away. Robin surmises that Matthews may try to lose himself in a large Hippie gathering, or \"Happening\", occurring in the park. The Teen Titans arrive, just as Captain Rumble rides in. Once more, violence breaks out between the Hippies and Captain Rumble's forces. The Teen Titans intervene. In short order, the cycle gang is, again, defeated. Ironhead and Buster catch up to Matthews, only to be beaten down, once more, by Wonder Girl. Robin convinces Matthews to lead the police to Big Arnie and Tram the Trucker, who are both arrested. Robin reunites Matthews with his parents. Matthews, realizing that he's just not cut out to be a Hippie, is grateful for the opportunity to return home.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The Titans prevent an invasion from another dimension that occupies the same space as Chet Walters' school.</em></p><p>Atop the Hillsdale High School rooftop, the Teen Titans eavesdrop on a conversation between Chet Walters, his father, and Principal Downs. Walters desperately tries to convince the older men that the school will soon become the beachhead for an invasion force from another dimension. His pleas falling on deaf ears, Walters leaps through the window, to escape being taken to a clinic \"for observation\". Wonder Girl takes off after Walters. As Walters races through the school grounds, he is taunted by his classmates, including his own girlfriend, none of whom believe in Walters' wild stories. Wonder Girl grabs Walters and brings him to the Teen Titans.</p><p>Walters explains that while he was painting graffiti on the side of the water tower, he was drawn to a glowing, green button. Pressing it transported him to an exact replica of the school, occupying a parallel dimension. There he learned of the plot to invade the Earth. Walters fled the alien invaders, barely making it back to his home dimension. The Teen Titans travel to the water tower, and repeat Walters' prior actions. They, too, are drawn into the alien dimension. The Teen Titans fight a running battle, throughout the school, as they try to elude the aliens' search and destroy squads. In the physics lab, the Teen Titans discover that Downs is really an advance scout for the alien invasion force.</p><p>Kid Flash attempts to destroy the dimensional bridging device, but instead merely disrupts it's function. The two dimensions begin to bleed into one another, allowing the aliens to invade the Earth. Robin attempts to evacuate the school, only to find that the faculty and students are being drawn into the aliens' dimension. Fighting another running battle through the school, the Teen Titans double back to the physics lab. There, they find Walters and Downs locked in combat. A stray shot from Downs' weapon destroys the bridging machine, sealing the warp between the two dimensions... with Walters on the other side. Kid Flash races at super-speed, fast enough to pierce the dimensional barrier, and retrieve Walters. With Walters vindicated, the Teen Titans take their leave.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The Titans recover Queen Elizabeth's stolen scepter.</em></p><p>Kid Flash, Wonder Girl, and Aqualad are in attendance, at a Command Performance, for the Queen of England, in Buckingham Palace. Suddenly, the Mad Mod appears, to steal the Royal Scepter. Kid Flash races up the stairs to nab the Mad Mod, only to be beaten back by a beefeater. Wonder Girl momentarily gets a hold of the Mad Mod, but a blow to her head, from the Royal Scepter, sends her crashing back down to the floor, on top of Aqualad. The Teen Titans had come to England, at the bequest of the Queen, to attend the Command Performance. Upon arrival, they were presented with dress costumes. While Wonder Girl, Kid Flash, and Aqualad partook of London's social scene, Robin toured the city's historical sights. By happenstance, the Boy Wonder is accidentally locked inside the Tower of London, and thus is absent for the Command Performance.</p><p>Kid Flash races after the Mad Mod's getaway van. Strangely, Kid Flash is quickly overcome with fatigue, and resorts to stealing a motorbike, to continue his pursuit. Aided by the London fog, Kid Flash is able to keep out of sight, as he chases after the Mad Mod. Unfortunately, the lack of visibility cuts both ways, as Kid Flash crashes into a haystack. On foot, Kid Flash catches up with the Mad Mod at the Chalk Charger, a seedy pub. Eavesdropping on the Mad Mod's conversation, Kid Flash learns that the Royal Scepter has been buried in the \"ear\" of an enormous chalk carving of a horse. Kid Flash retrieves the Royal Scepter, only to be brought down by the Mad Mod. Kid Flash radios the Teen Titans that the Mad Mod plans to bring the Royal Scepter to Loch Ness. Aqualad closes in on the Mad Mod's submarine, and retrieves the Royal Scepter from it's hiding place, within a large vase.</p><p>Fatigue, too, overwhelms Aqualad, who is unable to swim fast enough to escape the Mad Mod's net. The Mad Mod ties Aqualad up, within a tower, leaving him to die, from dehydration, when his hour out of water has elapsed. Aqualad summons the Loch Ness monster to the tower. As the creature pushes itself into the tower, it's mass displaces the water down below, causing it to rise high enough to engulf Aqualad. The monstrous size of the creature also brings the tower crashing down, freeing Aqualad. Wonder Girl pursues the Mad Mod to Stonehenge. She, too, is able to reclaim the Royal Scepter, from the Mad Mod's hiding place. Not without immense effort, though, as her Amazonian strength seems to be failing her. A mob of druids descend on Stonehenge, to offer Wonder Girl their adulation.</p><p>The Mad Mod's gang fight their way through the druids, allowing the Mad Mod to subdue Wonder Girl, and take back the Royal Scepter. Kid Flash, Aqualad and Wonder Girl reconvene, each noting the absence of the Boy Wonder. The team tracks the Mad Mod to his likely hide-out, the Ungrotty Grotto, in Cornwall, England. En route, the team change out of their dress uniforms, into their old costumes. Immediately, they feel the full strength of their powers returning. Somehow, the Mad Mod had sabotaged their dress uniforms to sap their abilities, giving him the edge in their conflict. The Teen Titans arrive at the Ungrotty Grotto just in time to see the Mad Mod hurl a body over the cliffs, and into the sea. Aqualad dives in, desperate to save the Mad Mod's unfortunate victim. Before Aqualad can reach the figure, a Killer Whale clamps it's jaws down over the passive form.</p><p>Kid Flash takes out the Mad Mod's minions, while Wonder Girl chases after the Mad Mod. A hastily pitched rock sends Wonder Girl tumbling over the cliffside. The Mad Mod then darts into the maze-like depths of the cliff grottos. Aqualad shoves seaweed pepper pods into the Killer Whale's blowhole, causing it to relinquish it's grip on the figure. The figure turns out to be a dummy, with the Royal Scepter hidden inside. A fatal miscalculation finds the Mad Mod trapped within the grotto at high tide. Just before the water fills the cavern, submerging the Mad Mod in the cold sea, Aqualad arrives to rescue him. The Teen Titans return the Royal Scepter to the Queen, then meet up with Robin at their hotel. The Boy Wonder goes on a tirade over how he missed the Command Performance, prompting the team to keep mum about their adventure.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The Titans and Starfire safeguard the crown jewels of Sweden from a jewel thief.</em></p><p>The Teen Titans are summoned to Stockholm, to aid in preventing renowned jewel thief, Andre Le Blanc, from stealing the crown jewels of Sweden. The Communist hero, Starfire, has been brought in on the case, for his prior experience in dealing with Le Blanc. From the start, Starfire does not get along with the Teen Titans, particularly Kid Flash. The Russian teen is forthcoming with details pertaining to his origin. He and his archaeologist father were investigating a meteor impact in the Yenesie River, in Siberia. They discovered the wreckage of an alien spacecraft, deep in the impact crater. The curious boy descended into the crater, alone one night, and was subsequently bombarded with strange alien radiation. The exposure super charged his cells, endowing him with enhanced speed, strength, and stamina.</p><p>Le Blanc strikes at one of Stockholm's jewel marts. A not quite unconscious security guard manages to activate the silent alarm, summoning the Teen Titans and Starfire. Kid Flash leads the charge, but Le Blanc floors him with a hastily tossed display pedestal. Starfire closes in on the fleeing thief. Le Blanc spins around unexpectedly, and kicks Starfire in the face. In a matter of seconds, Le Blanc makes his escape. Starfire take Kid Flash to task for getting in the way of his attack. The two teens nearly come to blows, before Robin steps in and diffuses their conflict. In his secret lair, Le Blanc goes over the building schematics for the the Stockholm jewel mart. Certain of his success, Le Blanc sends a taunting message to the Teen Titans, and Starfire. Unable to work together, the Teen Titans take their leave of Starfire.</p><p>During the day, Le Blanc secrets himself within the Sheldorf Diamond Center. After nightfall, Le Blanc, avoiding all security measures, makes his way over to the crown jewels. The Teen Titans, however, are also on the premises. Aqualad encounters Le Blanc first. Aqualad chases Le Blanc into the center's ventilation shafts. Le Blanc, however, doubles back out, and seals Aqualad inside the shaft. Kid Flash races after Le Blanc. The wily jewel thief leads Kid Flash into a trap. Tripping an electric eye, Kid Flash triggers an explosive device, set to detonate if Kid Flash makes another move. From the shadows, Starfire observes the Teen Titans struggles with Le Blanc. Robin and Le Blanc briefly trade blows, before Le Blanc gets the better of the Boy Wonder. Robin is left bound to a spiked chandelier, which will impale him should he tug on the ropes binding him.</p><p>Finally, Wonder Girl, too, is defeated by Le Blanc, who leaves her bound by her own magic lasso, the end of which he inserts into an electrical outlet. The crown jewels at last in his grasp, Le Blanc prepares to depart, when he is confronted by Starfire. The Russian teen chases Le Blanc into the subway station. There, Le Blanc once again bests Starfire, leaving him to die on the subway track. The arrival of the Teen Titans surprises Le Blanc. Starfire has freed them all from the traps Le Blanc left them in. Le Blanc hurls a grenade at the Teen Titans. Wonder Girl catches it with her magic lasso, and disposes of it. Kid Flash pulls Starfire off the subway line. When Kid Flash loses his balance and stumbles towards the oncoming train, Starfire rescues him. Le Blanc tosses the crown jewels into the sewer, forcing Aqualad to retrieve them. Robin confronts Le Blanc, and mercilessly beats him into unconsciousness. Though separated by their conflicting ideologies, the Teen Titans and Starfire achieve a respectful accord, and part as friends.</p>",

Something terrible lies buried in the Carrion Cove section of Genosha, a secret that, if placed in the hands of Magneto, could make him immeasurably more powerful. And although the Master of Magnetism has brought some semblance of order to the civil war-torn island nation, there are many people who fear his growing power. Among those people: Earth's Mightiest Heroes! Now, for the fate of the very world, it's Magneto vs. his own daugher and her teammates, the Avengers!</i>",

The males all oblige and offer her alcohol and cocaine. Afterward, Patty gets out of the tub and spreads herself out on a beach towel; requesting that the guys all line up and have their way with her sexually.</p><h4>Story: \"Bimbos From Hell\"</h4><p>After a nerd takes Dio, Ozzy Ozbourne, Richie Blackmore and the Mr. Ed song and plays them backwards on his computer, he summons Patty, Cherry, Lola and Ellie Dee, each decked out in rocker girl clothes. Cherry proclaims that he's summoned the band \"Bimbos from Hell\" and introduces each member. She states that Patty plays the drums when she's not busy fornicating or performing oral sex and that \"she'll do it anytime anywhere with anyone,\" to which Patty replies \"it's true, tee hee!\" Cherry then offers to grant the nerd any wish he desires, who then chooses to become the chief executive officer of Megatron. Transported inside the main office of Megatron, Patty immediately appears beneath his desk and requests to perform fellatio on him. She gets her wish once the nerd realizes the stress and hassles of being the head of a company and is transported back home.</p>",

    "description": "<h4>Story: \"Cherry has an Anxiety Attack\"</h4><p>Penciler: Larry Welz</p><p>Author: Larry Welz</p><p>Inker: Larry Welz</p><p>Cherry Poptart is hopeful that her friend Ellie Dee will be able to score a couple of tickets to the coming weekend's Aerosmith concert, but if not, she is confident that she will be able to get in one way or another. As she's walking to school, a guy working on his car, a group of boys fighting, and a guy trying to get into his stuck locker, all get distracted by Cherry. Her appearance even stops another teen from using a gun to commit suicide. As Cherry enters the World Lit classroom, she begins to slip into fantasy upon sight of the teacher, Mr. Le Mort. She pictures herself topless, giving the man fellatio as he, book in hand, reads 18th century literature. Cherry then gets fully naked and guides his penis into her vagina from the rear as he moves on to a chapter by Sir Walter Raleigh. Back in reality, Cherry is overcome with embarrassment as she realizes that she had been masturbating unknowingly, much to the laughter of her friend, Patty Melt and the rest of the class. Flustered, Cherry rushes out of the classroom and heads to Ms. Renfrew, the self-image counselor. Cherry begins by stating that she feels she is lacking self-esteem, causing an outburst of rage from the counselor. Ms. Renfrew shouts that she is sick of spoiled brats like Cherry who constantly complain about how tough they think they have it. The counselor apologizes immediately afterward, confessing that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Cherry lends a sympathetic ear, feeling sorry that the woman has to listen to the troubles of so many, without anyone there to listen to her own. She then gives Ms. Renfrew a shoulder massage, followed by a hug. When the counselor concedes that the gestures may not be enough, Cherry French kisses the woman and begins to undress her. The girl then compliments Ms. Renfrew's breasts and vagina before forcing herself on top of her and performing cunnilingus. After finishing making love, Cherry immediately feels a heightened sense of self esteem, and Ms. Renfrew states that she can not wait to share these new feelings with her husband, Roy. It's at that point that Cherry realizes that Mr. Le Mort is her husband and that she had kept her last name.</p><h4>Short: \"The Codex of Weird Head For Men &amp; Women\"</h4><p>Penciler: Mark V.

She then requests the dolphins do some tricks for her, such as dancing backwards on their tails. Working the graveyard shift, Cherry is glad that she gets to be there all by herself with the dolphins. She decided that she's waited long enough to do \"a little hands on research\", so she strips off all of her clothing and jumps naked into the water. Cherry splashes around with the dolphins for a few moments until one of them, Newton, rolls over, exposing it's erect penis. The aquatic mammal then gets very protective; not allowing the other dolphins to get near the girl. Newton communicates with Cherry, which she understands perfectly, and requests fellatio. Cherry is happy to oblige, but is taken by surprise when she is thrust underwater. She then decides to try climbing on to the dolphin's penis in the missionary position and begins fornicating until the two climax underwater. After the intense session, Cherry climbs out of the tank and feeds the dolphins some more fish. She then meets up with her boss later on who asks if Cherry had any thrilling breakthroughs or unusual behaviors. The girl replies \"not really\" but then says that another dolphin, Daphne, wants to take another swim with him, like the two had done the previous summer.</p><h3>Illustrations</h3><p>Illustrations include \"Robo Cherry\" - a spoof on the character RoboCop, Cherry's Mom, Pepper Poptart, relaxing at home by lifting her dress up to masturbate, and a naked Cherry slyly asking her canine companion what he's like to do next.</p>",

    "description": "<h4>Short: \"Performance Piece\"</h4><p>Cherry Poptart covers her naked body in Hershey's chocolate syrup to demonstrate how it can sometimes be misconstrued with fecal matter and cautions the reader to know the difference before they start licking.</p><h4>Story: \"Cherry Gets it in the End (Mom Does, Too)\"</h4><p>Cherry, who has just been dropped off at her house by her male friend Jimmy, offers him to come inside \"for a diet soda an' a blowjob\", to which he agrees. After giving him the beverage, she says to follow her upstairs. Jimmy questions if Cherry's mother, Pepper Poptart, is home. Cherry confirms this and says that she's currently having sex with the paperboy in the den. Inside her bedroom, Cherry French kisses Jimmy and starts to undo the zipper on his pants so that she can perform fellatio on him. All of the sudden, a male voice yells \"CUT!\" and the panel pans out to show Cherry and her friend on a set and surrounded by a film crew. The director states that there has been a couple of script changes, much to Cherry's confusion. A man named Ronald Plush then steps in to explain the situation, stating that he has bought out Cherry international, along with all its assets, and now owns the production. Two members of the film crew then hoist Jimmy away and replace him with a large, new male named Tiny. Cherry attempts to pick up where she left off, but is unable due to the small size of Tiny's penis. The director throws the man out and brings in a new replacement, Leroy. He then tells Cherry to remove all of her clothing, to which the girl enthusiastically complies. Cherry once again attempts to perform fellatio, but is unable to fit her mouth around the tip of Leroy's penis. Ronald Plus says just to</p><p>move forward to the anal sex, stating that it's all in the contract, to which Cherry requests some Vaseline and Valium. The girl then handpicks several more guys to participate in the scene. It is then that Pepper, dressed in sexy lingerie, shows up and offers to give her daughter a hand. Pepper then fellates a few of the guys while Cherry gets double penetrated. Ronald, unable to control himself, orders Cherry to fellate him as well. Seeing this, Pepper sneakily moves one of the guys over behind Plush so that he is ravished by him. Cherry then questions if this is how things are going to be now that they've been taken over. Pepper French kisses her daughter and quickly reassures her, stating that she had sex with his entire legal staff the night before and that he will be broke within six months.</p><h4>Short: \"Happy Whatever!\"</h4><p>Cherry, completely naked and surrounded by confetti and balloons, jumps out of a giant birthday cake, though she is not exactly sure what the occasion is.</p><h4>Story: \"Blazing Two-Breasted Bambi Action with Sgt. Cherry and Her Squealing Commandos\"</h4><p>Sgt. Cherry Poptart, Corp'ral Patty Melt, Prahvit Lola Palooza and Private Ellie Dee have become soldiers during Operation Desert Storm. Their daily training involves her having group sex with all of their male subordinates until they receive a fax to go to the Pentagon. There, they receive an order from President Dick Shrub to station in Saudi Arabia. There, they pass the time by masturbating until the time comes to infiltrate the hideout of the evil Soddom Buttreim. It is then that they incapacitate his forces, before Cherry equips a strap-on and reams the warmonger.</p><h4>Story: \"The Codex of Good Head and How To, For Men &amp; Women\"</h4><p>Penciler: Mark V. Bode</p><p>Author: Mark V. Bode</p><p>Inker: Mark V. Bode</p><p>A short showcasing the different ways for females to perform fellatio and men to perform cunnilingus.</p><h4>Story: \"Cherry Presents: Flashin' Fashion\"</h4><p>A naked Cherry requests to play \"dress up\" and shows off her various outfits, which includes a two-piece which helped her win a bikini contest, a \"Women Against Pornography - NOT!\" tank top, a black bra and panties, her mother's corset, jean shorts which have been almost entirely ripped, sneakers, panty-hose with high heels, a harem-girl costume, a dominatrice girdle complete with leather boots, and a bondage outfit made entirely out of thick rope.</p><h4>Story: \"Slut du Jour\"</h4><p>This marks the first time that the character Patty Melt has been central character in a story. Looking for something to do one afternoon, Patty phones up her buddy, Dick, and asks him if he wants to bring his friend Jack over to her place for a little fun. A bit leery that they might not be enough, she then decides to call a few other guys just in case. She eagerly greets them all at the door and initiates a large, and crowded, group sex session. At the end, Patty's body becomes so slippery from the fluids that she slips away from the mass of guys, jokingly saying that she hopes that they're all having a good time.</p><h4>Story: \"Wine High\"</h4><p>Cherry and Ellie Dee are driving in a convertible through California's wine country when they spot some hot-air balloons rising in the distance. Deciding to check it out, the two girls stumble upon a high-class wine-tasting party held at Chateau Sonapa. The maitre d' stops the two females and asks if they are of legal drinking age. Cherry responds by pulling down her top and flashing her right breast, to which the maitre d' graciously lets them enter. Upon closer inspection of the hot-air balloons, Cherry and Ellie Dee decide to have a race in order to win the affections of the male pilot. Midway through the flight, Ellie's balloon runs out of gas, while Cherry fellates and fornicates the pilot in hers, and ultimately wins the race. The male pilot remarks that \"she has a good head for extending flight time\" to which Cherry responds by giving a thumbs-up.</p><h4>Illustrations</h4><p>Illustrations include Cherry wearing nothing but a corset and panyhose stating that she willfully chooses to be a sex object, Pepper lifting up her business skirt to show that she isn't wearing panites, and a bottomless Ellie Dee using a special vibrator that is hooked up to her personal computer to masturbate.</p>",

    "description": "<h4>Story: \"Slumber Party from Hell\"</h4><p>Penciler: Larry Welz</p><p>Author: Larry Welz</p><p>Inker: Larry Welz</p><p>Cherry Poptart, Patty Melt, Lola Palooza and Ellie Dee use a ouji board in an attempt to contact the spirits of the dead. In doing so, they accidentally bring Elvis Presley back to life, but the meeting is short lived when the Ghostbusters show up and capture the apparition. Quickly after-wards, Patty notices a strange erect penis protruding from the center of the ouji board. Mistaking it for John Dillinger's, she touches the penis which transforms her into a hellish demon and compels her to masturbate with a crucifix. A priest immediately enters to exorcise Patty, but the possessed girl pounces on him to perform fellatio. The priest then engages in intercourse with her, but the orgasm sends him crashing through the wall. Next, a couple of religious televangelists stop by to try their attempt, but Patty</p><p>breathes fire at them, forcing them to retreat in panic. Finally, the \"Earth Mother\" is summoned through the ouji board, who screams at all of the evil spirits inside patty to leave. The spirits fearfully comply, returning Patty back to normal. The Earth Mother then explains that to close the portal opened up by the ouji board, the five of them must form a naked circle and dance around it. As per Patties, suggestion, the females follow up by getting high and performing cunnilingus on each other. After creating enough energy, the Earth Mother manages to close the portal and then vanishes.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The alien four armed creature continues to attack the city, now accompanied by an even stranger four legged beast Mikey dubs \"dino-dog.\" Leo, Don, Mike and Splinter attempt to stop the destruction while April and a slimey reporter named McIntyre broadcast the story. Leonardo cuts off one of the armored figure's arms, sending it into a painful retreat. The dino-dog leaps at the camera crews filimg the action and embeds itself into a news van, where it lays unconscious. The armored warrior then grabs one of the video cameras from a newsman and takes it to an abandoned alley. The Turtles discover that their adversary is blind, but in short order it attaches the camera to its head and uses it to see.<br/>Leonardo approaches the being, holding the severed arm. The Mutant Turtle apologizes for the attack and tries to give the limb back, but it suddenly springs to life and chokes him! The other Turtles implore the alien to release their brother. The creature slowly begins to assimilate the English language. After releasing Leo from its grasp, the alien explains that it is a Triast, one of a race of sentient, silicon-based lifeforms created by the Mergia.<br/>The Mergia had created the Triasts to work for them, but after time, the Triasts desired freedom, and a war broke out. The battles lasted for years, until the Triasts themselves created the \"dino-dogs\" called \"Battle-Beasts\", which gave them the upper hand in the conflict and sealed their victory. The Triasts tried to lobby for equal rights with the Mergia, but the creator race wouldn't accept the terms (even in defeat), so they fled the planet. This Triast's master left it with a final insult, taking its eyes before he left, leaving it blind. The Triast explains that the Battle-Beast accompanying it, named Qark, is helping it track its master. The alien pair have followed their prey to Earth. The former slave was able to retrieve one of its eyes from the wreckage of the space craft. It then explains that it needs all three of its eyes before it will be able to see properly.<br/>Mikey asks the alien of its name is Sarnath, and sure enough, it is. The Turtles take Sarnath back to their lair, where they receive a call from April, who informs the terrapins that McIntyre's TV show \"Inside Affairs\" is about to broadcast live footage of the captured Qark. Sarnath states that he can see what Qark sees, and the \"dog\" is surrounded by cameras. Donatello reattaches the symbiot's arm and then hooks up a monitor to the video camera that the alien is using to see, giving everyone a clear view of Qark's predicament.<br/>Donatello breaks into the control room of the TV studio and destroys the circuit box, sending the theater into darkness. The Turtles free Qark, just as the lights return - leaving our heroes in the spotlight. Leo shouts \"Vanish!\" and our heroes make their escape, leaving the studio full of bewildered reporters. April mocks McIntyre for losing his big story, and the man suspects that she's involved with the mysterious \"green men\" due to her smug attitude.<br/>Outside, Donatello explains to the disheartened Sarnath that his other two eyes were transported 100 years into the future. The other Turtles lament that the whole world has seen them, thanks to McIntyre's live broadcast. Splinter states that they'll have to maintain a low profile for quite some time and then Sarnath invites them to accompany him to Dimension X. Mikey is excited about the idea and Leo muses that they could try to fnd out what happened to Cudley the Cowlick. Splinter consents, and Mike, Don and Leo head off to the other dimension with Sarnath.<br/>Meanwhile, Raph and Ninjara are having a picnic in Japan when Sarnath's ship arrives. Ninjara and Raph join the others, and as they head into space, Leonardo tells the pair about their unexpected TV appearance.<br/>Back in the TV studio, McIntyre studies the footage of the TMNT.</p>",
