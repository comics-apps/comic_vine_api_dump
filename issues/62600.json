    "description": "<p><em> <u><i>Overview:</i></u></em><br /><br />Now begins the fall of the Shi’ar Empire! Vulcan and Deathbird have started their coup and they brought help: former mad emperor, D’Ken!<br /><br /></p><h3> <u><b>Issue Summary:</b></u></h3><br /><br />(Council Starways) <br />The great D’Ken delivers a rousing speech as his people cheer his return. Vulcan stands alongside Deathbird, watching the true emperors return to glory. Only days ago, Vulcan wanted to kill D’Ken with his bare hands. But, so many things in his life have changed since he and Deathbird escaped from the prison moon.  <p>(flashback) <br />Deathbird and Vulcan fight their way out of the prison, mercilessly killing or maiming many Shi’ar soldiers on the way. They work together well, almost instinctively. Vulcan admires Deathbird’s ruthlessness immediately. The people she murders were once her people, but she makes them pay with blood for keeping her prisoner, whether they were aware of it or not. They finally make it to a small jumpship with which they depart the moon.  </p><p>Deathbird takes the controls and Vulcan questions her as to who exactly the Secret Order are, and why one of them was willing to die so he could set her free. Deathbird isn’t entirely trusting of him, despite his actions on the moon. She wants to take it slow. Vulcan tells her that he had been told she was dead. She replies that many thought she had died in space, but the Imperial Guard captured her before death’s hands closed around her throat. Since then, she has been imprisoned. When Vulcan asks what now, Deathbird offers a wry smile, and replies that now they will burn out the stars… until the time is right.  </p><p>In the days that follow, Vulcan realizes that in Deathbird he has found a kindred spirit. They leave a bloody trail in their wake. She keeps secrets from him, but she shares other things: exhilaration, destruction and even passion. They soon become lovers, and Vulcan experiences emotions more intense than anything he’s experienced in his brief life. Soon, their stolen jumpship is the only place that matters to him. But, he knows it can’t go on forever.  <br /></p><p>Eventually they make their way to the emperor’s hospice to meet with Chancellor Araki, who bows upon her arrival. She asks if K’Tor’s messages were true. Has her brother recovered? Vulcan is surprised to hear her ask this. He thought <em>she</em> was going to be empress again. Deathbird replies that she lost her taste for ruling long ago. Araki presumes that he must be the Earther; the son of Corsair. He tells Deathbird that he can be allowed no further. Vulcan clenches his fist, but Deathbird holds out her hand to stop him doing anything impulsive. She informs Araki that Vulcan is her companion and he goes where she brings him. Araki reminds her that the Imperial Guard probed his mind and determined that he has a blood feud with the great D’Ken.  </p><p>Vulcan grins and asks Araki if he thinks anyone could stand in his way... any of his soldiers? Again, Deathbird tries to calm him down by saying what is past is past. Vulcan doesn’t think she can know how he feels, but Deathbird grabs his cloak. “You think I don’t know how it feels to yearn for <em>vengeance</em>? Haven’t you learned <em>anything</em> of me at all?” She kisses Vulcan and asks him to put aside his wrath. There are bigger things at stake there. Chancellor Araki turns and heads inside the building with Deathbird and Vulcan following. She asks Araki once more if D’Ken has recovered or not. Araki replies that it’s a little more complicated than that.  </p><p>He takes them through a room with several glass tubes inside it. In the tubes are Shi’ar telepaths; the best that the empire had to choose from. They chose them all. When Deathbird notices aloud that they are now all as catatonic as her brother was, Araki informs her that his treatment is experimental. They’ve spent years slowly knitting his mind back together since his exposure to the M’Krann Crystal. Even limited contact with his thoughts was enough to drive most of the telepaths insane.  </p><p>He then leads them to a large chamber where D’Ken lies in a bed; cables attached to his forehead and body. Deathbird asks what K’Tor meant by progress in his report. Araki replies that their most recent scans show something new. It appears that while he has yet to awaken, the telepaths cured D’Ken to some degree. His mind is calm and his brain patterns are nearly normal. However, the three divisions of his minds cannot communicate. The connections between them have been <em>severed</em>.  </p><p>He continues to inform Deathbird that their doctors believe that, over time, his mind will grow new neural pathways, and then he’ll awake as strong as ever. Deathbird asks how long that might take, but Araki says that is unknown. This isn’t the news Deathbird had hoped for, but Araki assures her that their forces will follow her as faithfully as D’Ken. Deathbird doesn’t think that is the case. They do not love her as they loved him.  </p><p>Vulcan mulls over what he has heard. He asks if neural pathways are partially constructed of electrical impulses in Shi’ar brains. Araki asks what he is suggesting. Vulcan believes there might be another option.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a Shi’ar craft flies through space on a mission to scan the outer moons. The captain asks his lieutenant why he has changed course. The lieutenant replies that he thought he saw an energy flare as they were leaving the atmosphere. Now he’s picking up a reading of a ship on the surface, not far from the emperor’s hospice. He puts it on screen, and the captain can see that it is Deathbird’s. The lieutenant asks how she could possibly know that their forces would be so weak this day. The captain intends to ask the chancellor that very question, and calls for the warships to be recalled.  </p><p>Back at the hospice, Araki tells Deathbird that Vulcan cannot be trusted. He wants D’Ken’s <em>death</em>. Deathbird reminds her chancellor who is giving the orders. She says that, if Vulcan swears he won’t harm her brother, then she believes him. Araki begins to complain, but Vulcan assures him that he’s doing this for Deathbird, not for him, D’Ken or anyone else. There’d be no honor in killing him like this, anyway. He wouldn’t even know the difference.  </p><p>Soon after, Vulcan has his hands placed at either side of D’Ken’s forehead, channeling energy into his brain. It’s easier than he thought it would be. With the gentlest of touches, he feels the dead pathways that D’Ken’s neurons used to travel throughout his brain, and he reignites them. D’Ken wakes with a start. He sits up quickly and splutters, trying to catch his breath. “<em>By the gods</em>!” exclaims Araki. Deathbird places her arms around Vulcan’s shoulders and tells him that he constantly amazes her. Vulcan coldly replies that he will kill him eventually. She should know that. Deathbird figures she will tame him of those urges before then. She licks his ear and whispers, “Let the past be the past.”  </p><p>D’Ken asks Araki to help him to his feet. The chancellor asks him to take it easy. He’s been away from them for some time. As D’Ken stands, a call comes through informing him that they have a problem. Their ships have returned and scouts report an entire battalion advancing towards their position. Araki replies that it’s about time that their Secret Order emerged from the shadows. “Open fire.”  </p><p>Things move quickly and brutally after that. As Vulcan joins Deathbird and soldiers working for the Secret Order in battling the encroaching Shi’ar troops, he realizes that he’s witnessing a major split among the Shi’ar. Much as Caesar crossed the Rubicon to claim what was his, this is Araki’s opening move to restore D’Ken to the throne and restore the Shi’ar Empire to its old ways. Araki assists D’Ken as Vulcan and his team makes short work of the soldiers. Part of Vulcan hates himself for making it possible. Part of him knows that he should have just killed D’Ken where he lay. However, there is another part of him that cannot stop glancing at Deathbird. He seems unable to refuse her anything. He’s never felt anything like this before. So, for now, he stays by her side to see what the coming days will bring.  </p><p>They leave the planet in a large ship and, as the days pass, they bring the unexpected. One day he is relaxing with Deathbird when a recovering D’Ken asks his sister to leave them. He has things to discuss with her Earther. Deathbird replies that she doesn’t think that is wise, but D’Ken assures her that he will not be harmed. Deathbird says that it’s not <em>Vulcan</em> that she’s concerned about. Vulcan stands and asks her to go. He wants to hear what D’Ken has to say.  </p><p>Alone, D’Ken tells Vulcan that Araki has informed him of his history, and apparently they have met before. His memory of those days is still hazy, but he remembers his father of course… Corsair. But his birth, he confesses, is lost somewhere in the blood rage he felt that day. Vulcan tells him that if he’s looking to appease him by referring to his mother’s death as his birth, it is not the way to go. D’Ken asks why he would seek to appease him. He is the great D’Ken, and everything Vulcan is today, he owes to him. But, he does have a debt that he means to repay.  </p><p>Vulcan asks how he intends to do that. D’Ken informs him of an arcane Shi’ar law. According to the texts, <em>any</em> child born in the high palace on Chandilar may rise to become royalty. Though it was never intended to allow one such as Vulcan into their midst, his sister’s affection for him is plain and his power formidable. He would rather have Vulcan at his side than at his back. As they chat, the ship they are in heads towards an operational stargate. D’Ken informs Vulcan that he wants him to marry Deathbird. He’s asking Vulcan to join the imperium as they rise once more. <br /></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Pietro Maximoff, formerly known as Quicksilver, betrayer of mutantkind, is at his lowest ebb. Crushed and defeated, his only hope and refuge lies with the Inhumans. Re-united with his wife Crystal, will his desperate ambitions lead him to an even greater betrayal? </em></p><p>It’s dark out there... but Pietro can hear voices discussing his fate...</p><p>A familiar voice to Pietro asks Spider-Man what he did to him. Spider-Man tells Crystal he knows how this looks, but explains that he’s one of the good guys. Pietro starts to wake up, and is surprised to hear Crystal’s voice. Crystal again asks Spider-Man what he did to Pietro. Spidey promises he didn’t do anything, and that they were just talking. Crystal doesn’t believe that. Spidey points out they were standing on the roof, and Pietro just... fell.</p><p>Crystal gets even angrier hearing this, finding Spider-Man’s explanation hard to believe. Spider-Man knows how that sounds, but... Crystal doesn’t let the webslinger finish his sentence, thinking he is lying. She powers up and attacks Spider-Man with her elemental powers. Pietro calls out to Crystal, who is relieved he’s alive and thanks her god, Randac. Almost with no breath left, Pietro confirms to his estranged wife Spider-Man didn’t do anything. He also didn’t fall... he jumped. Spidey adds that he tried to save Pietro. His web even slowed him down some but the guy still hit the ground pretty hard. Crystal asks Pietro why he would jump.</p><p> </p><p>Pietro faints again. Crystal takes a look at his neck, thinking his spine is broken. Spider-Man tells Crystal they need to bring Pietro to a hospital, and asks if Lockjaw can take him. Crystal is certain that Earth’s hospitals won’t save Pietro, and asks Lockjaw to stand behind her. Lockjaw does and starts growling at Spider-Man, who is a bit scared by it. Crystal asks her loyal dog to taker her and Quicksilver home, and Lockjaw teleports them all away! Spider-Man tries to ask them to wait, but is too late... the Inhumans and Pietro are already gone. Peter wonders where Crystal’s “home” is.</p><p> </p><p><i>Attilan... </i></p><p>Crystal, arriving home holding her former lover in her arms, demands to be brought to a healer!</p><p>A short while later, the rest of Crystal’s loyal family has brought Quicksilver to the care of the healer Kalikya. Standing behind a window and looking as Kalikya places her hands on Pietro to patch him up, Medusa promises her sister she doesn’t need to worry, as Kalikya is one of the Inhumans’ finest healers. Gorgon thinks Pietro shouldn’t be here. He knows Black Bolt gave Crystal permission to answer Pietro’s distress signal, but didn’t gave permission to bring him back here. Crystal explains to her cousin that Pietro was dying. Should she have left him to die instead?</p><p> </p><p>“Of course not,” Medusa adds. Pietro may remain with the Inhumans until he is fully recovered. Gorgon still doesn’t like it, remembering that trouble follows at Crystal’s husband’s heel like a sick dog. Medusa, a bit angry, asks Gorgon if he’s questioning his monarch’s decision. Gorgon promises he would never do that, but he is curious as to how Maximoff came by his injuries. Crystal confirms that what they heard is true. Many of the human mutants have lost their abilities, and Pietro is one of them. Gorgon hopes that perhaps this will teach Pietro humility. Crystal rather believes that Pietro would find it... difficult... to live as a normal human, and it seems that his injuries were self-inflicted.</p><p> </p><p>Crystal touches the window with her hands and can’t keep her eyes off her husband. She keeps staring at Quicksilver, before she realizes that Black Bolt gives her a questioning look. Medusa mentions they will talk about Pietro’s future when he is well. As Medusa and Black Bolt leave, Crystal and Gorgon stay behind. Crystal knows Gorgon never approved of her marriage with Quicksilver. Gorgon adds that Crystal’s marriage was the first between Inhuman and human, and now, looking at Pietro being healed up by one of their own, they can look at the result. Crystal disagrees. The result of their marriage was Luna.</p><p> </p><p><i>Days later, when Pietro is as good as healed... </i></p><p>A happy Luna meets up with her father in his room, who is surprised to see her so big. Luna smiles she knows she has grown, as she’s six years old now. She also brought her dad a present. She had her friend, San, make it especially for him, and it’s the only one like it. She hands Pietro a box. He opens it and finds a red stone inside it. He smiles it’s beautiful and Luna smiles hearing that. She goes to sit next to Pietro on his bed, and asks why he never comes to see him. She wonders if it is because her dad is human and that humans don’t get along with Inhumans.</p><p>Pietro promises that isn’t the reason. He confirms some humans... <i>many</i> humans, actually, distrust anyone who appears superior to them. “But I’m not”.... Pietro says, but he doesn’t finish his sentence. Luna mentions that some of her friends hate humans too, because they attacked them so the Inhumans had to come live here on the moon. Pietro gives her a sad look, but Luna tells him not to. After all, <i>she</i> doesn’t hate him! Pietro and Luna laugh together, not realizing that a smiling Crystal watches them around the corner.</p><p> </p><p><i>Again some time later... </i>BR&gt; Wearing his costume again, Quicksilver and Luna walk through the big city of Atillan together, holding each other’s hand. Pietro asks his daughter where he is taking him today. Luna wants her dad to meet Videmus, who is a communicator. They enter a big house and meet Videmus on a balcony, and Luna introduces the two to each other. Videmus welcomes Pietro and sees it as a big honor to be of service to him. Pietro isn’t entirely sure what service Videmus intends to provide. Luna explains that Videmus can make her see what her dad is thinking. All Pietro has to do is think of a picture and she’ll see it, too.</p><p> </p><p>Videmus reminds his honored guest he has no sight of his own. He depends on others for his vision of the world and hopes Pietro will show him something splendid. Videmus stretches his eyes onto the minds of Pietro and Luna. Seeing lots of colors, Videmus mentions to Pietro that his mind is a vortex. He must focus on a single image. Pietro asks Luna what she would like to see. Luna wants to see the ocean, so Pietro thinks of an image of the ocean, with lots of fish in it. Luna is amazed. Luna asks Pietro if it’s true that, when she looks up at the Earth, all the blue is water.</p><p> </p><p>Not far away from the moon, the Earth can be seen in its full glory, but a mysterious, red energy light is orbiting it.</p><p> </p><p><i>Afterwards... </i></p><p>Quicksilver has been brought to the throne room, and asks Black Bolt for permission to undergo Terrigenesis. Medusa explains to Pietro that isn’t possible. The genetic council has forbidden humans from exposure to the Terrigen mists, and that this ruling stands for all time. To this, Pietro proclaims that he is <i>not</i> human! All he wants is to have his mutant status restored, and he believes the mists would do that.</p><p>Medusa calmly tells Pietro he is... he was... a <i>human</i> mutant. She reveals that, long ago, the process of Terrigenesis was opened to all Inhumans without regulation. The resulting mutations were often radical... monstrous. The damage to the Inhuman gene pool was disastrous. It has taken many millennia to restore the balance. Now every Inhuman must undergo rigorous genetic screening before being allowed to transform. That screening automatically blocks persons of human descent.</p><p> </p><p>Pietro wants to know what that means for his daughter. Medusa says Luna is excluded from the mists, as it would be unsafe for her ever to be exposed to them. Pietro angrily states he doesn’t accept that! Medusa apologizes, but this isn’t open to discussion. Quicksilver disappointed leaves the room, leaving Black Bolt wondering.</p><p> </p><p><i>Later that night... </i></p><p>Pietro visits Videmus at his home, and overlook the city from it. Videmus knows for sure that must be a wonderful view, though Pietro replies Videmus can’t really see it. Videmus rejoins that he can, if Pietro allows him. He attaches his eyes on Pietro’s mind again, and asks him to turn a little to his right. Videmus is impressed to see the Earth rising. Videmus asks Pietro to what he owes this visit.</p><p>Quicksilver explains Luna told him Videmus is revered as an educator. That he retains images and information from his mind links. Videmus can imagine it’s rather like the computers the humans are so found of. He asks Pietro if he seeks knowledge. Pietro wishes to learn of the Mists of Terrigen. Videmus tells Pietro to clear his thoughts. He has to make his mind a palimpsest upon which he may inscribe his histories.</p><p> </p><p>Videmus reveals it is now almost 25,000 years ago since the Inhuman geneticist Randac isolated the catalyst for human evolution. It is an incredibly rare mineral, which exists in crystal form. Randac named the crystals “Terrigen.” At the correct temperature, when exposed to water, the crystals react to produce a vapor, known as the Mists of Terrigen. These mists are pumped into the flux chambers during the process of Terrigenesis. The crystals themselves are kept in a sealed cavern below the surface of Attilan, where they are constantly exposed to the heat and saline water. It is from this source that the Mists are collected.</p><p> </p><p>This cavern is guarded by the Maledicta siblings, a tradition which has continued in their family for millennia. Their duties are largely ceremonial. No Inhuman would ever dare to enter the chamber without authority of the council. Videmus doesn’t envy the guards, believing their minds must scream with boredom. He further explains that at the entrance to the cavern is an airtight chamber, which serves as a barrier to prevent the escape of vapors from the lower levels. Only those who are appointed by the council to maintain the crystals may enter. And they must wear protective suits to avoid exposure to the Mists. To enter without protection would be to risk irreversible genetic trauma. No more than a dozen honored members of the Inhuman race enter the cavern each century. It is the holiest, most sacred place imaginable... the living heart and soul of the Inhuman culture. To desecrate those hallowed grounds would be unthinkable.</p><p> </p><p><i>Not long after hearing the story... </i></p><p>Pietro walks toward the room where the Mists are stored. He spots one of the guarding Maledicta siblings, and quickly knocks him out. He drags them to a safe spot so they won’t be seen by anyone. Pietro presses a button, and a door opens, allowing him to enter the chamber. He bathes into a pool where the Mists are stored... and is exposed to them! Pietro feels his hands shaking. He looks at them, and can’t control it anymore! Suddenly, his entire body seems to fall apart!</p><p>Eventually, Pietro manages to control himself. His body is restored back to normal, and Pietro feels he failed. He doesn’t feel any different now, and did everything for nothing. He leaves the room, noticing the other Maledicta sibling. Pietro realizes that, when the other guard is discovered, the Inhumans will have no doubt who attacked him. At best, Pietro thinks, he will be expelled from Attilan and sent back to Earth. But that means he will never see Luna again, and wonders what Crystal will think of this.</p><p> </p><p>Pietro goes back to his room, where he is shocked to discover he isn’t alone. He looks at an older version of himself, holding the glowing red stone Luna gave him earlier! This version, remaining calm and sitting in a chair, says “hello” to Pietro...</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>What do Art Adams, Joe Kubert, Pete Woods, Rags Morales, Kevin Maguire and Eric Wight have in common? No, they're not the latest rogues in Superman's gallery! Rather, they're just some of the talents DC has assembled to deliver ACTION COMICS ANNUAL #10, the place to catch up on all that's new to Superman's world - and to catch a glimpse of things to come in future issues of ACTION!</em></p><p>Lex Luthor is exploring through the jungle thinking about the different ways he could <i>kill</i> Superman. The idea that most intrigues Lex is death by Kryptonite. To him, that would be the most ironic way.</p><p>Young Clark must live his life carefully. He cannot play games such as baseball out of fear of hurting his friends. On his way home, he sees a rocket speeding towards Earth. He flies up to attempt to stop it. On the ground, a slightly older boy emerges speaking Kryptonese. He says, \"son of Jor-El.\" He has no other memories.</p><p>At the Kent farm, Clark brings the boy into the storm cellar where all of Clark's Kryptonian artifacts are. The boy sees a flag with an S-shaped symbol that he recognizes as the symbol for the House of El. The two believe that the boy must also be from Krypton. They decide that his name should end in \"El.\" The boy takes \"Mon\" as the first part, seeing it on a calendar. Thus, he is now known as Mon-El.</p><p>Clark and Mon-El secretly prevent accidents to save lives. Clark even gets to play \"baseball.\"</p><p>Having nightmares, Mon-El is haunted by a phrase, \"You don't belong here...\" Determined to discover whether or not he truely is Kryptonian, they go into storm cellar to see if Kryptonite has the same deadly affect on Mon-El as it does for Clark. As soon as Clark removes the lead box containing it, Mon-El becomes deathly ill.</p><p>He now remembers that his name is Lar Gand and that he is from the planet Daxam. Lead is extremely poisonous to his people. There is no cure. Mon-El figures that being sent Lar to the Phantom Zone, where time stands still, is the only way he can survive.</p><p>Clark is left \"alone\" again.</p><p>Thanagarians investigate why three of their police cruiser have become lost in a certain sector. They are greeted by three Bizarros who only have one word to say to them, \"Hello.\"</p><p>A two page spread showing the different parts of Superman's Fortress.</p><p>Jor-El and his mentor Non discover that Krypton is doomed to explode. The Science Council refuses to hear of it. General Zod and his troops take them away on charges of heresy. They are given a warning by the council and told that their discssion on the destruction of Krypton was forbidden.</p><p>Jor-El works secretly on a rocket as Non speaks to the people. General Zod begins to believe the word of Non. Non is soon taken away in the night. Missing for two days, he was found outside of the city with a fresh scar on his head. His intellect had been taken away.</p><p>Outrage, Zod speaks to Jor-El and demands that they destroy the Council. Refusing to believe that violence is the answer, Jor-El doesn't take part in the attack. Defeated, Zod, his lieutenant Ursa, and Non are captured. Jor-El steps in and rather than have them sentenced to death, ensures that they are placed in the Phantom Zone, where they still will have a chance at life.</p><p>Zod vows that he will return to rule and will make Jor-El his slave as he is a slave to the Council. Jor-El will bow before him as will his son, Kal-El. Jor-El disagrees.</p><p>Luthor is discussing the different affects the different types of Kryptonite have on Superman. He discusses green, red, blue, and gold. Not being able to decide on which should be used to kill Superman, Lex uses all four to give Metallo and upgrade. This marks the beginning of Lex's Revenge Squad.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In this, the first appearance of the Ultimate Black Cat, young Peter meets a real woman!</p><p>The Black Cat breaks into a building to steal a tablet, and in the process the guards experience lots of \"bad luck\" caused by the Cat! After she beats a hasty retreat from the scene, Felicia encounters Spider-Man up on the rooftop. Spidey gives chase, and the two skirmish. After the Black Cat easily beats the young hero, she informs him that he crossed a Black Cat, and will get seven years bad luck! She gives him a smile, and disappears into the night!</p><p>Later on, Peter confides in Mary Jane that he is thinking of giving up being Spider-Man, and asks her what she thinks. Mary Jane tells peter that it would be nice to have a more \"normal\" relationship.</p><p>Then MJ's dad arrives and demands an explanation from Peter. You see her dad has read her diary and now knows that MJ fell off a bridge and almost died, if not for Peter saving her! He then forbids Peter from seeing MJ anymore, and threatens him until Aunt May kicks him out of her house!</p><p>After Peter is left alone to ponder what has happened, he sees a television report concerning the Black Cat, and the reporters think thad Spidey and the Black Cat are working together!</p><p>It can only get worse for our hero................</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Ethan Daniels is a typical bachelor who suffers from one, infallible truth: dealing with the opposite sex can be complicated. One night, he bumps into a mysterious woman who will change his life… and maybe even the world.</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>Ethan Daniels lives in Pennystown, a small community in the middle of nowhere. His interactions with the ladies has been nearly non-existent. As such, he misinterprets many innocent situations to be come-ons. For instance, while working at the Teenie Weenie, Pennystown's grocery store, Howard and Ying-Ma McCallister's daughter asks Ethan to squeeze her melons, which he interprets as grabbing her breasts. (She clearly means her cantaloupes.) Later at the bar, the town flirt sits on Ethan's lap and tries to get him out of a funk. Ethan takes the gesture to mean that she wants to sleep with him. Hoping to make his ex-girlfriend jealous, Ethan kisses Alexis. She flips out and sends Ethan into a tailspin.</p><p>Having been humiliated by the event with Alexis, Ethan flips out and begins verbally abusing all the women in the bar, including the McCallister's daughter (whom he had invited). Each of the bar patrons are shocked at Ethan's behavior and the town cop tosses Ethan out and into the rain. Embarrassed, Ethan shouts. The rain suddenly stops. Everyone looks at Ethan as if his rage has stopped the rain. Ethan drives off in a frenzy.</p><p>On the road, Ethan nearly hits something. He hops out of his car and finds a naked girl in the road. She is hurt and passes out in his arms. He takes her to his car and drives her to his house to patch her up. A grizzled man and his son emerge from the bushes to see the girl taken away by Ethan. They swear that they will find the girl and kill her.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>“The Bottom” Part 1 (of 6)</p><p>The Fist of Khonshu is back and badder than ever, courtesy of acclaimed novelist Charlie Huston (Caught Stealing, Six Bad Things) and red-hot, fan-favorite artist David Finch (New Avengers).</p><p>Marc Specter used to talk to God. His god anyway. Khonshu -- God of the Moon, God of Vengeance -- saved Spector’s life, brought him to glory, made him a hero. Made him Moon Knight. But what Khonshu gives, he also takes away. And once he takes, he takes for good. Spector learned this the hard way, spiraling into madness, depression and worse. But he also remembers. Remembers what it felt like to jump off the top of a six-story tenement, cloak spread behind him. Remembers the feel of cartilage and bone exploding beneath his fists. Remembers the fun stuff. Now Specter wants back in the game. Will Khonshu hear his prayer?</p>",

    "description": "<p>Billy Batson is a young orphaned child. He lives in an abandoned building and is terrorized by an older street thug named Lagreen who takes any money Billy gets and beats him if he doesn't cooperate. As Billy sits in his room during a storm, Lagreen barges into his room.</p><p>Earlier, Billy was enjoying some hot soup with an older homeless man, Talky. Billy sees a man that looks like his father across the street. Billy follows him into the subway. They get on a red and yellow train with a yellow lightning bolt on the side. The train makes a stop and the mystery man tells Billy to get off.</p><p>Inside a big cavern, Billy sees seven statues, Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, Laziness, and Injustice along with an old man sitting at the end of the room. Billy assumes he's God but he tells him he's just a wizard. He says his time is short and he needs a replacement.</p><p>The wizard chose a magic word for Billy comprised of the name of heroes whose powers he will gain: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. Upon saying \"Shazam,\" Billy is transformed into Captain Marvel.</p><p>Marvel is told he has a new host. Just then, his time is gone and the wizard is seemingly crushed.</p><p>Back in his room, Billy utters the word, \"Shazam!\" and Lagreen is thrown out of the window.</p><p>Later Captain Marvel flies back in time with Billy to the Rock of Eternity. The Rock sits at the moment of the Big Bang. Billy wants to go to the top of the mountain to see what lies before our universe was born. Captain Marvel tells him that it is forbidden. Inside, they talke to the spirit of the wizard. Captain Marvel believes that Billy should be living a better life. The wizard discovers that Billy has a younger sister that he was unaware of.</p><p>About to utter the magic word, Billy is stopped. Using magic at the Rock of Eternity would cause a terrible paradox. He is told to wait outside. Just then, the eyes of the seven statues open. This indicates that something big is going down back on Earth.</p><p>Going to get Billy to head back, they find he is not outside. His bottom of his shoes can be seen floating above the tip of the mountain. Marvel snatches him down.</p><p>Billy awakes back in his room. Thinking it was a dream, he hears the noise of police sirens and helicopters. Out the window he hears a women call for help. Going down, he finds the two preying on the woman are not men, but rather alligators dressed in clothes that can talk. They tell Captain Marvel that their leader, Mr. Mind, will be looking for him.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The seeds of Ms. Marvel’s upcoming new status quo are planted here! Killer robots! Contagious zombies! Impatient teen side-kicks! Could it get any worse for Carol Danvers? You bet – because as our heroine battles the cybernetic psychopath known as the Doomsday Man, she learns a terrifying truth about herself! All this, plus Araña and Wonder Man! Writer Brian Reed (New Avengers: Illuminati) and penciler Roberto De La Torre welcome onboard new cover artist Greg Horn (She-Hulk) – and get you ready for next month’s new era!</em></p><p>Carol Danvers, Ms. Marvel continues to fight inside an A.I.M. facility where the Doomsday Man was kept. She finds herself fighting a horde of zombies. It turns out that they are contageous. The slightest touch turns that person into a zombie.</p><p>Thinking she can defeat the Doomsday Man as she did in the past, Carol finds that he's had some <em>upgrades</em>. She has also become infected by a zombie. Doomsday Man takes advantage of this and nearly defeats her.</p><p>Thinking she's about to die, Carol sees a bright light and hears voices. Somehow, her broken rib and zombie infection have been healed.</p><p>Tired of waiting outside, <a data-ref-id=\"40598\" href=\"/ara-a/40598/\" slug=\"ara-a\">Araña</a> ventures inside to join the fight. Doomsday Man tears her carapace off, not knowing that it's not just a costume but part of Anya.</p><p>Enraged, Carol knocks Doomsday Man outside and gives him a serious beat-down. She tears Kerwin Korman out of the Doomsday suit. With a \"thank you,\" Korman passes out.</p><p>At an A.I.M. bunker, it seems that involving Ms. Marvel with the Doomsday suit was a plan to test it out. It seems that there is a group of A.I.M. members that wish to kill their leader, <a data-ref-id=\"3709\" href=\"/modok/3709/\" slug=\"modok\">M.O.D.O.K.</a>.</p><p>At the hospital, Anya's father yells at Carol to stay away from his daughter.</p>",

Using diamond dust, red wavelength uvb lights, and dressed in her Batgirl costume, Cassandra attacks Supergirl. The narrative shifts back and forth from the fight to flashbacks of her father seemingly experimenting on her, telling her that she's <i>special.</i></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the fight, she sees Boomer beaten and chained overhead. Captain Boomerang is at first relieved to see that Supergirl has responded to his attempts to contact her to rescue him, but is shocked to discover Kara is ignorant of his calls. Kara is trying to explain when Cassandra takes advantage and slashes Kara's stomach with a energy katana, drawing blood. Grabbing her from behind, Cassandra and Supergirl are both surprised when some crystal-like blades protrude from Supergirl's back and stomach wound, impaling Batgirl's shoulder and side. Kara places a call to Powerboy to help her with the injured Boomer, interrupting Powerboy from adding another photo of her to his secret shrine to her. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Exodus returns from being banished to Nowhere.</p><p>On a S.H.I.E.L.D. hellicarrier, Rogue, Cable, and Mystique talk to Director Maria Hill about using their technology to help Northstar and Aurora. They want to try to continue the treatment S.H.I.E.L.D. started on Northstar after he had been brainwashed by the Hand. They also hope to cure Aurora of her schizophrenia. The VR programming would allow them to relive their entire lives. Hill reluctantly allows them provided they do not get in her way.</p><p>As the programming is in progress, the hellicarrier is attacked. Exodus and his Acolytes, Random, Frenzy, and Tempo infiltrate the carrier. The S.H.I.E.L.D. computer is hacked into which causes an overload which puts a stop to the programming before it is complete. Northstar and Aurora come out with their minds scrambled. Their minds seem to have been merged into one. Confused, they simply run at high speed. Eventually, they decided to stop running and face their confusion together. Joining hands, they generate a bright light. Seemingly cured, they help put a stop to the Acolytes.</p><p>The three X-Men give chase but are intercepted by the Acolytes. As they fight, Exodus is in the hellicarrier control room and constructs a make shift Cerebro unit to detect mutants. It is his plan to find all the new mutants being born after the Decimateion and create a new Genosha. The X-Men arrive and inform Exodus that there aren't any new mutants. The results of the Decimation have changed the human genome and the x-gene is no longer present.</p><p>Enraged, Exodus and his Acolytes leave. They soon venture to Antartica where Exodus bows down in front of a man in shadows with red eyes who is well-known in the X-universe.</p>",

While at the Arcade, Mr. Fantastic fixes some of Arcade's stuttering, twitchy robots. This irrates Arcade to a point that we wants to hurt Mr. Fantastic in his Funhouse of Doom. Reed is having a hard time understand what people find fun at the Arcade because its so pointless. One of Arcade's robots lures Mr. Fantastic to the Funhouse of Doom. Once in the funhouse, Reed's powers are neutralized but he defeats the traps with a mixture of intellect and cunning.

    "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>A searing vision of Spider-Man’s future, brought to you by rising star Kaare Andrews (INCREDIBLE HULK).</p><p>The rumors are true -- he’s back. Come down from the mountain like a righteous wraith of vengeance, dispensing rough justice and then swinging off into the night. Things were going well, too…that is, until Mayor Waters dispatched his contingency plan -- the newly reassembled Sinister Six -- and things got complicated. Now Peter Parker isn’t just fighting for his very life, but to keep alive the spark of hope that’s been squelched under Waters' boot. But first, he’ll have to contend with the thing that was formerly known as Otto Octavius.</p><p>Following the defeat at the hands of the Sinner Six, Spider-Man is carried off by the seemingly dead remains of Doc Ock and his mechanical arms. He is taken to the cemetary where Uncle Ben, Aunt May, and Mary Jane are buried. Spider-Man flashbacks to when Mary Jane was lying in a hospital bed. He is saddened that she had been poisoned with radioactivity from him. He wasn't by her side as she passed on. As crime was occuring outside, she told him to \"Go get 'em, Tiger.\"</p><p>In the office of Mayor Waters,' J. Jonah Jameson is dragged in by Reign officers. Jameson believes that Waters is a monster but it turns out it is really his aide, Edward Saks. Saks appears to be bonded with the symbiote Venom.</p><p>In the city, as the Webb System is active, not allowing anyone to enter or leave the city, the children working with Jameson's underground decide to take on masks and fight. Venom reaches across the city consuming people as the sacrifice to protect the city.</p><p>As Mary Jane's corpse is seemingly dragged away from Peter, he follows. At her coffin, he enters and emerges in his \"red and blues.\"</p><p>It appears that the true Spider-Man is back just in time to take on Venom.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>X-23’s bloody past continues to unfold, and the man called Wolverine is haunting her every step of the way! What is Trigger Scent, and what are the Facility’s plans to re-capture X-23? And what does the Kingpin of Crime have to do with it? Captain America and Daredevil are along for the ride as X-23 digs her claws deeper into the Marvel Universe, and not everyone is going to make it out alive.</em></p><h3>Spoilers</h3><p>X-23 continues to be held captive and questioned by Captain America and Matt Murdock. She tells them more about the Trigger scent that makes her kill anyone marked with it. The conditioning began when she was eight years old. She tells how she was used to kill an assassin that was blackmailing Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of crime.</p><p>Back when she went to her Aunt Debbie's and was hanging out with her cousin, Megan, X-23 was discovered. Her aunt's boyfriend turned out to be a Facility agent. The plan was put in place for X-23 to kill them with use of the Trigger. The agent was preparing a kettle of tea mixed with the scent. He calls Megan and asks them to pick up a prescription for her mother. On the way home, X-23 sees a newscast of the announcement by Professor Charles Xavier that they were mutants. X-23 catches a glimpse of Wolverine on a television.</p><p>As Megan and X-23 arrive, Megan accidentally knocks into the agent and spills the tea on him. As she helps to pick him up, he begins to panic, hysterically asking \"Where is X-23?!\" Marked with the Trigger, X-23's eyes go red as she pops out her claws.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The thrilling conclusion to the Skrull organ story line pits the Heroes for Hire against Ricadonna’s cadre of villains and an army of the Corporation’s android assassins. Meanwhile, the recently fired Tarantula sets out to take revenge for the murder of her father by killing Ricadonna. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Ricadonna has undergone a physical transformation from crime lord to super-powered freak show!</em></p><p>The Heroes for Hire track Ricadonna to her lair where villains are being implanted with Skrull organs. The Heroes for Hire fight their way through a cavalcade of b-listers and robots while Misty and Tarantula try to take down Ricadonna. Ricadonna is clearly more powerful than Misty and an violent intervention by Tarantula saves her life. Ricadonna decides its best to leave and grows wings to fly off. Colleen crashes her into the Skrull organ machine before the team destroys the building. Ricadonna survives and now is completely green like the Skrulls. The Heroes for Hire offer their condolences to Tarantula who recently lost her father to Ricadonna's assassins and her sister to the Stamford explosion that started Civil War. Tony Stark outfits the team with a new and improved base. The issue ends with a kid coming into the Heroes for Hire headquarters with a jar full of coins saying that he needs to hire a hero.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Quicksilver’s hopes of rebuilding his life are dashed as he is rejected by Crystal and humiliated by the Inhumans. But they will all live to regret the way they have treated him when Pietro carries out a terrible revenge. </em></p><p>Quicksilver is shocked to find an alternate, older version of himself waiting for him in his room, and demands to know what this is all about. The other Pietro smiles he knows it’s disorienting to come face-to-face with yourself. He adds that Pietro’s first thought must be he passed out in the cavern and that all this is a dream. “No,” the real Pietro says, “this feels...”. “Too real,” the other Pietro adds. He jokes that maybe he’s an Inhuman, one who has the ability to mimic his form. But he knows exactly what Pietro is thinking, so that makes him also a mind reader. He claims the truth is simpler. He knows what Pietro is thinking because he remembers it!</p><p>Pietro asks his older self what he is saying. The older Pietro explains they didn’t fail. The process of Terrigenesis restored their speed, but in a different form: “Time travel,” the older Pietro devilishly grins. The real Pietro asks if that means his other self has traveled there from the future. He hasn’t. The other Pietro explains they can only travel forward in time. At this moment, every atom in Pietro’s body is vibrating so quickly that he has been shifted out of synch with the space-time continuum. That means the real Pietro has travaled here from the other version’s past. Fourteen days to be exact. Pietro doesn’t buy that, because his other version looks so different.</p><p>The other Pietro admits he doesn’t look at his best, but mentions time travel can have a debilitating effect. He’s confident Pietro will find that out soon enough. The other version wants Pietro to listen carefully to what he is about to say. He reveals Pietro’s time here at the other universe is limited. He has moved through time, but is still anchored to his present. For a short while Pietro can remain here in his future, as if running on the spot, but when he tires, he will be pulled back to the past, to the precise moment he left. That will happen in a few minutes. He continues to say that Pietro will return to the night <i>they</i> entered the cavern. The guard they attacked has been found, and their presence in the cavern is detected. At this moment, the alarm is being sounded.</p><p>Pietro fears that means he will be discovered. “No,” the older Pietro smiles. Quicksilver will return to the exact moment he left, but to this location. And when Pietro goes back, he will find himself here, in their room. Pietro will respond to the alarm, join the crowd rushing towards the cavern. He will make himself noticed to establish an alibi. Pietro asks what happens then. He wonders what the use of this ability has, and what effect it has on... both of them. The other Pietro mentions that a single exposure to the Mists was not enough. They have to find a way to access the cavern again.</p><p>Quicksilver says this isn’t easy and needs to be sure this is all real. The other Pietro understands. Pietro touches his other self’s chest. The other Pietro smiles that the sensation of déjà vu is quite extraordinary. Pietro feels as if he has stepped outside of himself. He wants to know if they are two people or one. Pietro stares at his hands and feels strange. The other Pietro explains that’s because Pietro is about to leave. But before Pietro leaves, he has to take something with him. It’s important. Pietro is handed over the glowing red stone, the sculpture Luna gave him earlier. Pietro takes the stone, and asks his other self if there’s something he needs to know, why he doesn’t just tell him. Pietro vanishes and, after his younger self is gone, the other Pietro grins it’s because he didn’t.</p><p><i>Shortly afterwards... </i><br />Pietro emerges back into his room, and can hear the alarm going off. He looks at Luna’s stone he stored on a bookshelf, and remembers what Luna said to him when she first gave the stone to him, that “it’s the only one like it.” Pietro places the stone he received from his older self next to the one he got from Luna, and can’t help but wonder what would happen if he didn’t join the crowd and remained in his room.</p><p>But, Pietro does go outside and stops a man walking among a panicking crowd, asking what’s happening. The Inhuman explains the alarm from the sacred cavern is going off, which is strange, because it never sounded before! All of the Inhumans sense an imbalance in the ambience of the crystals.</p><p>After thoroughly searching through the Terrigen caves, the Maledicta twins bow ashamed before their king. They beg for forgiveness but, they say, if the sanctity of the Mists has been violated, that means the desecrator has evaded them. Medusa asks Crystal where her husband is. Crystal can see Pietro standing in the crowd, which means it couldn’t have been him. Medusa can see Pietro as well, and hopes her sister is right about that. Among the crowd, Videmus is using his powers to tap onto each Inhuman’s mind to discover the culprit.</p><p><i>Later, at Quicksilver’s room... </i><br />Crystal asks her husband if it was him who entered the room. Pietro doesn’t see how Crystal can even ask that question. Crystal gently places her fingers on Pietro’s lips, not certain if he has changed too much or too little. Pietro removes her hand, and asks Crystal if there is a chance for them. Crystal admits she thought so, but now isn’t sure. She mentions that Medusa has asked her to inform him that in the future, Pietro will be accompanied at all times when he leaves this apartment.</p><p>As Crystal leaves, Pietro mocks to himself he won’t be turned into a prisoner. He touches his head, wondering how time travel works. He did it before by instinct, and now is determined to learn to control it. He recalls his other version said something about his every atom of his whole body vibrating. He wonders if he could visualize time rushing past, by making hours pass like seconds. Pietro moves really fast forward in time, and again meets up with his other self, who was already waiting for him!</p><p>Pietro asks his other self what day it is now. The other version smiles it’s eight days in Pietro’s future. The two Pietros realize they can take objects with them through time, but they can only be inorganic, nothing that lives. They can take Luna’s crystal, but not when they are being watched. The other Quicksilver believes they must leave Attilan and return to Earth. The real Pietro isn’t sure about that. The other Pietro informs his younger self that six days from now, he will come meet him again and he will be ready that day. Then, Pietro will know what to do. They <i>will</i> get the crystals. The other Pietro knows about this because he has already seen it happening. They will take the crystals back to Earth and then they can start to undo this mess. They’ll restore all the mutants who lost their powers, and give them back what Wanda took from them.</p><p>The real Pietro wonders about Luna. He’s not going to repeat their father’s mistake. He will not leave Luna again. The older version tells Pietro he’s going to talk to his daughter. He’s going to ask Luna to return to Earth with him. Pietro wants to know what she will say. The older version simply replies Pietro will find out soon enough. Pietro wants to take the red crystal back, but before he can, the older version reminds Pietro not to worry about Jolen, as he has dealt with him. The real Pietro doesn’t even know who Jolen is.</p><p><i>Seven days earlier, the home of Crystal Maximoff... </i><br />One of the Maledicta twins drops Quicksilver off at Crystal’s home, but reminds him he will be waiting for him here. A female guard opens the doors, and tells Pietro her highness is in the gardens, and suggests to announce his arrival. Pietro tells the guard there’s no need for that, as he will find her. He finds Crystal in her beautiful garden, talking to another man. Pietro hides behind a tree to spy on them.</p><p>Crystal compliments her gardener, Jolen, that he has worked wonders with this garden. It looks like an entirely new species. Jolen admits it is just that, and takes a red flower from a tree, which he named after Crystal. He places the flower in Crystalia Amaquelin’s hair, saying that she earns the most beautiful plant in Attilan, as she is its most beautiful woman.</p><p>Pietro angrily runs towards the two, demanding that Jolen takes his hands off his wife! Both Jolen and Crystal are shocked to see Pietro. Quicksilver smacks Jolen in his face and Crystal begs him to stop this. Jolen falls on the ground, bleeding. Pietro grabs him by the throat, but Jolen tells Pietro he just made a mistake. He betrayed his bestial nature, declaring that means like a wayward beast, Pietro must be crushed. Jolen uses his powers to control the plans and has vines trap Pietro, crushing his bones. Jolen informs Pietro that he mustn’t waste energy struggling to escape, because that won’t work. Pietro isn’t sure about that.</p><p>Crystal asks Jolen to release her husband and he does so, and apologizes for this. Crystal says it’s okay, as the fault wasn’t his. Pietro promises Jolen he will see him later. That’s just fine by Jolen, who will be ready at any time. Crystal tells Pietro he probably now sees why they can never be together... because of his ridiculous, childish jealousy! Pietro thinks he has good reason to be jealous, as Crystal has betrayed him before. He will <i>not</i> be humiliated by her affairs. Crystal becomes angry, thinking she feels something for that “boy,” Jolen. Pietro calmly takes the flower out of Crystal’s hair and crushes it, trying to make a point. Crystal angrily reminds Pietro he doesn’t own her. He never has, and never will. She goes back inside her home, and leaves Pietro alone.</p><p><i>Two days later... </i><br />Quicksilver sees Luna playing with Lockjaw in her room, and tells her it made him very happy seeing her again. Luna feels good about it too, but sees her dad is looking sad again. Pietro sits on his knees, and tells Luna he may have to return to Earth soon. Luna thought her dad was here to stay. Pietro doesn’t want to leave Luna, but there are reasons. Things he claims Luna is too young to understand. Luna doesn’t want Pietro to go.</p><p>Pietro asks Luna what she would say if he asked her to come with him. Luna doesn’t think her mom would ever allow it, to which. Pietro doesn’t think they need to tell Crystal. Luna doesn’t think there’s any way they could leave without her mother knowing about it. Pietro wonders if Lockjaw does what Luna tells him to do. Luna smiles he does, because she’s the only one who plays with the dog. The others just use him to go places. She hugs Lockjaw, glad that he will do anything she says. Pietro asks Luna if she’s absolutely certain about that. Luna is, and realizes what her dad is thinking off. Pietro gently touches Luna’s head, telling her she doesn’t need to decide yet. They can talk again later. But, he does remind Luna, she mustn’t talk about this to anyone. She asks Luna if she understands what he is saying. Luna just quietly stares at her dad.</p><p><i>Nine days later... </i><br />Pietro has shifted into time again, and thinks he’s getting better at this. The older version thinks Pietro is getting good enough, and informs him they’ll do it tonight. He doesn’t want to wait any longer. He has everything they need: tools and a container for the crystals. He mentions that Videmus has been very generous, and their ever-present shadow, Goran, never sees a thing. The older version does feel sorry for Goran. He asks the real Pietro to listen carefully. He wants Pietro to go back to his present and rest. When he’s strong enough, he has to jump forward as far as he can beyond the time when they’ve left Attilan for Earth. He’ll do the same and meet Pietro at the cavern.</p><p>Quicksilver worries about the guards, as they can’t be seen. The other version promises he’ll take care of it. It’s less complicated if his younger version doesn’t know about it. He just wants Pietro to be ready, and bring a golden knife with him. Pietro gets a bit scared, not understanding what the knife will be used for. The older version confidently promises Pietro he doesn’t have to worry, as it will be all right.</p><p><i>Twelve days later... </i><br />Pietro, holding the golden knife in his hands, enters the caverns and meets his older version around a corner. Pietro doesn’t think this makes any sense, believing he doesn’t need to be here. The older version tells Pietro he can trust him, and that it has to be like this. He wants Pietro to wait here. He enters the caves.</p><p>Goran spots the real Quicksilver and holds his sword ready for action. He knew something wasn’t right! Pietro asks Goran to stay back, as he doesn’t want to do this. Goran refuses, but before he can say anything else, Pietro stabs his knife through Goran’s chest!</p><p>Meanwhile, the older Pietro dives into the pool where the Terrigen Mists are stored in, and secrets some of it inside his container. The older versions steps a few minutes back in time, right before Goran discovered the real Pietro. The older version sees Pietro stabbing Goran, and mourning his death. On that moment, the real Pietro sees his older self and realizes his other self knew about this. He wants to know why he wasn’t told about this. The older version doesn’t think it would have made any difference. This is the way it <i>always</i> happens.</p><p><i>Eleven days earlier... </i><br />Quicksilver, carrying the container over his shoulder, tells Goran he’s taking a gift to his daughter. He doesn’t think that really needs his attention. Goran apologizes for it, but he’s just doing his duty. Pietro thinks Goran’s duty will be the death of him. Pietro opens a door and asks his daughter if she’s ready to leave. Luna is surprised today is the day they are going to Earth. Pietro explains to Luna they don’t want to worry her mother. He has Luna write a letter saying that she’s happy to go with him and that he promises to send Luna back whenever she wants.</p><p>Luna has Lockjaw teleport them all to Earth, but still believes her mother is going to be mad at them.</p><p><i>A few moments later... </i><br />Luna, Pietro and Lockjaw land in a dark alley on Earth. She isn’t impressed and wonders why Earth smells so bad. Pietro wants Luna to send Lockjaw back to Attilan, but has to tell him not to bring anyone else there. Luna does what her father asks, and tells Lockjaw it’s a game, like when they play hide-and-seek. She’s hiding now and her mom mustn’t find them. Lockjow gives Luna an uncertain look, but teleports away. Pietro thinks they need to move quickly, confident Crystal will follow them, with or without Lockjaw.</p><p>A few moments later, they arrive at Pietro’s apartment, which has nothing in it but a bed and a chair. Luna wonders if they are going to stay here. Pietro knows this isn’t what Luna expected, but promises it isn’t like this everywhere. He promises they’ll go someplace better soon. Luna wants to go to the ocean. Pietro promises they will go there soon. But first, there is something he wants Luna to do. He shows her the container, which holds the Terrigen crystals. It’s the birthright the Inhumans tried to keep from her.</p><p>Luna remembers that the council said it was too dangerous for her to be exposed. Pietro’s eyes glow a bit, teaching his daughter that people lie. Luna is scared and doesn’t want to do this. Pietro opens the container and the Mists come out of it. He promises Luna she can trust him, as he would never do anything to harm her.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Quicksilver’s betrayal is discovered and Crystal leads a group of angry Inhumans in hot pursuit. Meanwhile Pietro lifts the lid on a Pandora’s box of dark forces, which threaten the future of three races -- mutant, human and Inhuman. And the first casualty could be his own daughter. </em></p><p>Attilan, the moon… </p><p>Lockjaw is back home, but Crystal has already discovered the unwanted departure of her daughter. In a furious rage, she traps Lockjaw in her elemental powers and demands to know where Lockjaw took both Pietro and Luna. Lockjaw becomes scared and tries to run away, but Crystal won’t let him. Karnak tries to calm her down, but she can’t; not after her daughter has just been kidnapped! Medusa reminds her sister that according to Luna’s note, she left of her own free will.</p><p>Crystal doesn’t buy that: Luna is six years old! Of course she wanted to go. She knows Luna must have built up a fantasy of Earth as a wonderful, magical place, and that Pietro probably encouraged that. Medusa tells Crystal that Pietro is Luna’s father, and perhaps she should spend time with him. Crystal asks Medusa if she has seen Pietro lately. She knows something is seriously wrong with him. She thinks that maybe if Black Bolt and Medusa had children of their own, they might have <em>some</em> idea of what she’s feeling right now!</p><p>Black Bolt and Medusa quietly glare at Crystal. Finally, Medusa promises her sister they will contact Reed Richards and request the Fantastic Four to locate Pietro. But for now, they must ask Crystal not to pusue them. Crystal asks Medusa if that’s really <em>her</em>decision. Black Bolt gives his sister-in-law a serious look, making it clear he made the decision. Medusa allows Crystal to appeal to the council if she wishes. She knows this is hard, but she’s certain Pietro loves Luna. Crystal admits that. In that case, Medusa is certain Luna is safe with him. With full confidence, Crystal mentions that being loved by Pietro... has it consequences.</p><p><em>Earth... </em></p><p>Quicksilver has the Mists return back into his container, and asks Luna how she feels. Rubbing in her eyes, Luna feels a bit... light. Her head’s going around, and her eyes feel strange. She opens them and looks at her father, however Luna is shocked when she can see Pietro in a complete blue color. Further, when he calls out her name, lots of colors appear. Luna explains she can now feel what her dad is feeling... and finds it beautiful.</p><p>Suddenly, Luna becomes frightened when she sees a black spot in Pietro’s body. Pietro can’t see it and asks Luna what it is. Luna sees something dark in her dad, which is spreading all over him. She asks Pietro if he can feel it, and if it hurts. Luna doesn’t like this, and doesn’t want to see the dark stuff anymore! She turns away from Pietro, who tries to cheer her up. He touches her shoulders, promising she doesn’t have to worry. He thinks what Luna is seeing is only scary because it’s new. He’s certain she will learn to control her powers.</p><p><em>Later... </em></p><p>Pietro and Luna have moved to a house at the ocean. Luna stands outside on the beach, wearing dark sunglasses. She stares in front of her. Pietro, holding a newspaper in his hand, walks outside his new home and meets up with his daughter. Luna asks her dad if he has been time jumping again, and if that is next week’s newspaper he’s holding. Luna wonders why her dad doesn’t just pick the jackpot instead of the little prizes. That way, they would have all the money they need.</p><p>Pietro starts reading, explaining he doesn’t want to draw attention to them. Especially not now. He reads an article about the Inhumans, which says that they have already traveled to New York and demand the return of stolen artifacts. Pietro explains to his daughter that in six days, the Inhumans will be coming for them.</p><p><em>Time passes. It’s night... </em></p><p>Luna walks back inside her home. She stops for a while, and looks behind her. She calls out the name “Lockjaw,” but sees nothing but a few big footsteps behind her, and her own as well. Deciding not to give it much thought, Luna meets up with her dad, who is sitting on his bed. She asks Pietro why he’s afraid of Black Bolt. She wonders if he did something bad when he took the Mists.</p><p>Pietro stops inhaling the Mists, and explains to Luna he had every right to take them. He knows the Mists are a natural resource, and feels Black Bolt is wrong to keep them only for the Inhumans. He’s confident the mutants who lost their powers need the Mists of Terrigen. And he’s going to give those mutants their powers back. As Luna inhales the Mists as well, Pietro informs her they will be going to Genosha.</p><p><em>Later, at the ruins of the island Genosha... </em></p><p>Callisto sits on her knees in the ruins of a house. She picks up a bone and puts it right through her hand! Though she starts to bleed, she doesn’t scream out in any pain. Suddenly, she hears a helicopter landing nearby and goes to check it out. Callisto is startled to see Quicksilver and Luna stepping out of the aircraft, and wants to know what they are doing there. Callisto explains to Luna that her grandfather has told many things about her. Luna says hello to Callisto and, as she takes off her sunglasses, asks Callisto if she can look at her.</p><p>Calissto doesn’t see why not, as everyone else does. Luna’s eyes start to glow, and when she stares at Callisto, she can see the woman’s body glowing as well. She puts her glasses back on, and thanks Callisto. Luna then informs her dad that Callisto hurts herself. Callisto admits that, and thinks it’s nice Luna got herself a super-power. She asks Pietro how his daughter is still a mutant when the rest of them aren’t. Callisto quietly stares at her hand, and sees a hole in it. She closes her fist, and calmly confirms she does hurt herself.</p><p>Almost babbling, Callisto explains to Luna she used to be special too. All of her senses were heightened. She could see in the dark, hear a leaf fall. If someone sliced a lemon half a block away, Callisto could taste it in the air. Her skin was so sensitive, and making love was... Callisto stops talking right there, not wanting to discuss that in front of the kid. She further says that, now, she feels like being wrapped in lead. She’s actually shortsighted. Callisto asks Pietro if he can believe that she thinks she’s going to need glasses. She admits she hurts herself because everything is numb... dead. She just needs to feel something.</p><p>When Luna suddenly tells Callisto that her father can give her powers back, Callisto wants to know more. A short while later, Pietro has informed Callisto about the Terrigen Mists, and suggests she inhales them. Callisto asks if Pietro’s certain this is going to work. Luna thinks that perhaps Pietro could time-jump and find out. Pietro replies he could do that, but it wouldn’t change anything. He feels Callisto must find out for herself, as she has nothing to lose. Callisto won’t pretend to understand what Pietro is talking about, but she gets the “nothing to lose” bit. She starts inhaling the Mists, and Pietro reminds her to take deep breaths. Regular deep breaths. Luna also tells Callisto not to worry about the dizzy feeling, as that always happens. Callisto stops inhaling, asking Luna if that’s so.</p><p>Not far away, Magneto stands on a balcony and holds binoculars. The device spots visitors on the island, and Magnus can’t help but wonder who would want to come here now.</p><p>Pietro asks Callisto how she’s feeling. Callisto triumphantly stands up, and feels better now: she can smell the rain coming. Her powers are back! She can’t thank Pietro enough. Pietro explains he wants to do this for everyone he... He quickly changes his phrase, saying that he wants to do this for everyone who lost their powers. If only he had more. When Callisto asks what the stuff is she inhaled, Luna explains it’s the Mists of Terrigen and that her father took them from the Inhumans. Callisto doesn’t like that idea, because she knows they shouldn’t mess with the Inhumans. Luna thinks it’s alright, believing the Inhumans don’t even know the Mists are gone.</p><p><em>Meanwhile on Attilan, at the chamber of Terrigan... </em></p><p>Goran explains to Videmus, who uses his powers on the minds of the guards to find the culprit, that it’s the Maledicta family’s duty to guard the chamber. Their family has tended this post day and night for twenty-seven generations now. Videmus mentions he’s well aware of the history of the Maledicta clan, claiming he knows more about it than Goran himself. But, Videmus also says, he is a member of the council and is ordering all of the guards to accompany him to the royal palace at once. Black Bolt has need of them.</p><p>Goran agrees to come, if the order comes from their king. The Maledicta siblings both follow Videmus and ask him what the crisis is, as the city seems peaceful. Videmus doesn’t want to hear any questions, promising Goran will learn soon enough. Goran thinks something’s wrong, and runs back inside the chamber. Videmus doesn’t want Goran to disobey him, but he ignores that and heads back inside. Goran’s brother apologizes for his sibling, but Videmus says it’s okay. What will be, will be.</p><p><em>Some time later at the palace of the Royal family... </em></p><p>The Maledicta sibling and the other guards bow before the Royal family and ask what duty their liege requires of them. Medusa doesn’t understand that, and asks why the guards are there. Videmus tells Medusa that the guards are here to arrest him for high treason. Black Bolt calmly looks at Medusa, who in turn is rather shocked by the revelation.</p><p><em>Shortly, back at the chamber of Terrigen... </em></p><p>The guards find Goran dead. Goran’s brother apologizes for not listening to him. More guards come running scared, having discovered that the caverns have been violated, and that some animal has taken tools to steal some of the crystals. Medusa asks what about the Mists themselves. The guard explains it will take many years for the crystal formations to repair themselves. He thinks unless the crystals are recovered, there will be no Terrigenesis. Gorgon angrily demands to talk to Videmus.</p><p>Back at the palace, Gorgon wants to know why, of all people, Videmus betrayed them. Medusa wants to know as well. She knows Videmus is a historian, who has no greater respect for the Inhuman traditions. She wants to know what reason he could have to do this. Gorgon wants to know the name who conspired with Videmus. Kalikya and another Inhuman enter the room, carrying a beaten up Jolen over their shoulder. He states to the Royal family Pietro was responsible for this!</p><p><em>Genosha... </em></p><p>Quicksilver asks Callisto how many mutants who have lost their powers remained on this island. Callisto isn’t sure, but thinks maybe a dozen have. He asks Callisto to find them and bring them to him, and to tell the mutants he can save them. Callisto does as told and is overjoyed. She has never felt so alive!</p><p>As she takes off, it starts to rain. But the pain feels like acid on Callisto’s skin, and she can’t bear the agony! Magneto meets up with her and asks what’s wrong. Callisto shouts that every raindrop feels like a needle in her flesh! It’s too much! The light is blinding her. She can’t stand the stench of Magneto’s sweat in the air. She can hear insects, billions of them, crawling under the ground. She can feel her nails growing! Magneto goes to sit on his knees, and asks Callisto how this happened. Callisto reveals that Magneto’s own son did this to her.</p><p>Magneto is anything but happy to hear Pietro’s name...</p>",

Naturally, our Merc With a Mouth is going to find it first, right? Well...only if he can outwit that superspy known as the CAT, and slide by the undulating charms of three gorgeous and deadly snake chicks--that's right--Black Mamba, Asp and Diamondback are back in business as the B.A.D. Girls! And what's Cable doing during all of this...? Well, keeping an eye on Deadpool, since whoever owns the hard drive could very well own the world...</i></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>From the pages of New X-Men, the resident bad boys (and girls) of Xavier's get their own miniseries. The Hellions spend the summer in California, where they'll discover the dirty secrets from one of their pasts and will face a temptation that will determine whether these kids will be heroes or villains.</em></p><p>(Two days ago)</p><p>In her office at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, Westchester New York, the school headmistress Emma Frost a.k.a. the White Queen thanks her prized student, Julian “Hellion” Keller, for stopping by. Emma informs Julian that the X-Men have been called away on important business, so she will not be able to attend Prize-Giving tomorrow. Julian looks away from Emma, and protests, reminding her that they are going to win the big prize, and as she is their advisor, she has to be there.</p><p>(Yesterday)</p><p>Danielle “Dani” Moonstar, advisor to the New Mutants and former New Mutant herself, stands at the podium on Prize-Giving day. Dani tells everyone that it has been a big year for everyone, and as the students are all aware, a new field day program was put in place that allowed for squads of students to compete against each other. Dani announces that she would like to award the trophy to the squad that performed the best, adding that it should come as no surprise to anyone who followed the standings.</p><p>(Two days ago)</p><p>Emma tells Julian that she is very proud of them all, before asking him to be honest in that it hasn’t been the smoothest year for the Hellions. ‘Smooth? My team works like a machine!’ boasts Julian. Emma admits that they do and that their tactical skills are quite impressive, but reminds him that the squad itself has had a few bumps along the way.</p><p>(Yesterday)</p><p>Despite her own squad not being the winners, Danielle smiles as she asks the Xavier Institute students to join her in congratulating this years winners in the field day events…the Hellions! Dani does a roll call for the Hellions, introducing them to any students that may be unaware of who they are, while Julian holds the trophy high up in the air.</p><p>(Two days ago)</p><p>Emma points out to Julian that his team has alienated all the other squads as well as almost getting the school into legal trouble. Julian tells Emma that if she wanted all the squads to get along then she shouldn’t have put them in a position where they have to compete with one another. Emma tells Julian that there are ways to accomplish their goals, ways to succeed without putting others down, adding that she wants him to be better than that. Julian mutters that he will try.</p><p>(Yesterday)</p><p>Delivering his winning speech to all the students at the Institute, Hellion declares ‘Hey, losers! You can try to take this back next year, but it’s never gonna happen. You may as well inscribe “Hellions” on this trophy permanently“.</p><p>(Two days ago)</p><p>Julian frowns, but the White Queen puts a hand on one of his shoulders, telling him that he has great potential, pointing out that she wouldn’t have allowed him the name “Hellion” otherwise. Emma then admits that she has no doubt Julian could become an X-Man one day, before telling him that he cannot keep getting in himself into trouble, doing whatever he thinks he needs to do to succeed.</p><p>Emma reminds Julian that people who have power and use it to do and get whatever they want are labeled <em>villains</em>, adding that she was on once, before telling him that she doesn’t want that life for him. As Julian turns to leave the office, Emma informs him that she wants him to use the Summer to reflect on this, but Julian replies that there is no time for reflection as he has his squad coming to his family’s house in California, adding that they have big plans for the Summer.</p><p> </p><p>Emma replies that regardless, she is glad they will all be together, as perhaps they can all learn a valuable lesson. Julian mutters that he understands Emma is not going to be at Prize Giving, and he has received his lecture, so can he go now? ‘Things need to change, Julian’ states Emma. ‘Right, Miss Frost. I’m on it. Trouble = bad’. exclaims Julian.</p><p> </p><p>(Today)</p><p>Julian and the rest of the Hellions are surrounded by security guards at the airport. ‘Stop right there! We don’t want any trouble!’ announces one of the security personnel. Most of the Hellions hold their hands up as another of the security guards tells them to stand down, as there is no way a boy made of rock and a girl made of metal are getting on this place!</p><p>Julian comes to his team’s defense and informs the guards that they have tickets and identification, so they have a right to get on the plane like everyone else. The “boy made of rock” Santo “Rockslide” Vaccarro tells the officer to bet his butt that he is getting on this plane. The “girl made of metal” Cessily Kincaid a.k.a. the current bearer of the codename “Mercury” whispers that maybe this wasn’t such a good idea.</p><p> </p><p>Pessimist member of the Hellions, Kevin “Wither” Ford, mumbles ‘Here we go again’ before asking Julian why he doesn’t get it, that mutants like them have no rights. The most reasonable of the Hellions, Afghani refugee Sooraya “Dust” Qadir suggests that they should cooperate. Hellion’s lackey Brian Cruz a.k.a. Tag asks Julian what his call is, as he will play it either way. Julian reminds his teammates that they have a Summer vacation waiting, so they need to get on the plane! ‘Right!’ shouts Rockslide as one of his hand detaches from his body and is fired across the lobby, knocking one of the guards aside.</p><p> </p><p>The airport security guards start shooting at the Hellions, but Julian puts up a telekinetic shield which they bullets cannot penetrate. He asks Mercury to disarm the officers, and Cessily does, by using her liquid mercury body to extend her hands and grab the guns of two of the officers. Wither tells Julian that he will not use his powers to kill anyone, to which Hellion replies that he wouldn’t ask him to, and tells Brian to keep Wither safe.</p><p> </p><p>‘Hold still, Kevin. Tag, you’re it!’ exclaims Brian as he touches Kevin’s sweater, resulting in several of the airport guards running away from them. ‘Must get away!’ ‘Must run away!’ Angrily, Kevin turns to Brian and mutters that he gets enough of people running away from him because of his death touch, and asks Brian not to do that again, pointing out that he could have tagged himself and they would have just run away.</p><p> </p><p>Tag doesn’t respond, and Julian quickly changes the subject by asking where Sooraya is. The security guards gather themselves around a corner, and the commander tells his officers to stop, as whatever that kid did to them is wearing off. He begins to explain that they need to regroup, when suddenly, a dust storm appears out of nowhere right in front of them, and Sooraya can be seen inside it, she asks the guards to please not shoot, as there must be some way to resolve this.</p><p> </p><p>As Sooraya lets her dust storm fade away, Julian and the others come up behind her, and Julian reminds Sooraya that he is in charge of this squad and points out he didn’t send her out to chase the officers down, as she could have gotten herself hurt. Sooraya informs Julian that she did not chase the security guards down to fight, and reveals that that they are now willing to talk and suggests that the Hellions should be also. ‘Fine, lets talk’ declares Julian.</p><p> </p><p>Shortly, the six Hellions are in the airport security guards office, where the commander tells the kids that they are in a lot of trouble, asking them if they know how much damage they could have done or how many passengers they could have hurt. Julian points out that the did no damage and harmed none of the other passengers, before excusing himself to make a phone call.</p><p> </p><p>The officer asks the Hellions how he is supposed to put them on a plane. Motioning to Mercury, he points out that there isn’t a metal detector in the world she could get through. ‘I just want to go to California - I’ll go as luggage’ pleads Cessily, but Rockslide tells her that she shouldn’t have to go as luggage.</p><p> </p><p>Wither speaks up and tells the officer that they have heard this all before, that they are dangerous and can’t be trusted with their powers, before backs up Cessily, reminding the officer again that they are just trying to go on vacation. The security officer asks how he is supposed to tell the passengers that they will have to fly with a group of dangerous mutants.</p><p> </p><p>Julian smirks as he finishes his phone call, informing the officer that he has just talked to his parents lawyer and that he should be expecting a call any minute. The officer tells Hellion that talking to a lawyer is not going to change his mind, but Julian points out that he didn’t say his parents lawyer was going to call him. On cue, the phone rings, and another of the security personnel answer it, informing the commander that it is for him - the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p> </p><p>‘I can’t believe you can’t get a meal on a plane anymore!’ complains Hellion as the plane the Hellions are on soars towards California. Turning to the stewardess, Julian asks if he can at least have another bag of pretzels. Sitting in front of Hellion and Tag are Mercury and Dust. Cessily asks Dust if she has ever been to California before, to which Dust simply replies ‘No’. Cessily reveals that she has been once before and went to Disneyland and everything - back when she was a kid before her body transformed into metal.</p><p> </p><p>Cessily explains that her parents never quite know how to deal with her like this, and when she goes home, she stays inside a lot so her parents wont have to answer any questions, before adding that she thinks her parents are relieved that she is not coming home for a few weeks, not to mention that this gives her a chance to spend some time with Kevin.</p><p> </p><p>Dust asks Mercury if she really likes him, and Cessily replies that she does, before asking Sooraya if her parents are cool with her taking off for Los Angeles. Glancing out the window, Dust replies that she doesn’t know, and reveals that she was kidnapped from her home in Afghanistan several years ago, then sold into slavery, and although she has tried to track her mother down, since the war, it has been difficult. ‘…oh…’ utters a surprised Mercury.</p><p> </p><p>Across the aisle, Santo brags to Wither that they totally taught the security guards a lesson, to which Kevin replies that there wasn’t much he could do. ‘You got power, Kev. Maybe not as much as me, but…’ exclaims Rockslide until Kevin interrupts, pointing out that Santo can use his powers, while he wont use his because when he did has Dad died. Santo apologizes, ‘Course you won’t use it,’ he remarks, before telling Kevin that he is still one of them.</p><p> </p><p>Julian turns to Tag and informs him that his parents will be in the Caribbean for a month, adding that it is no big deal, as they go away all the time and they will have the house to themselves. Tag replies that it is outstanding, before asking Julian if his parents really do know someone at Homeland Security. Julian replies that his parents know lots of people, that they are super-connected, adding that none of it is inherited.</p><p> </p><p>Hellion reveals that his parents fought their way up from the working class - a total rags to riches story - and now they are corporate bigwig billionaires. ‘Then why are we flying coach?’ asks Brian, holding up a bag of <em>Cheapos</em> pretzels.</p><p> </p><p>Later, the Hellions arrive in Los Angeles, and are escorted through the airport by a security guard. Julian tells the officer that he doesn’t need to follow them, as they are leaving. The officer just replies that he has got his orders. ‘Fine’ mutters Julian before telling his teammates that he is sure there is a car waiting for them and that they will soon be on their way. But outside, Julian is stumped - no car. He exclaims that he doesn’t understand, as his parents always arrange a car to pick him up - even when they are out of town. ‘Right. Cab then?’ mutters Tag.</p><p> </p><p>Later still, a taxi drops the six Hellions off at the Keller Mansion, ‘Whoa! This place is awesome!’ declares a awestruck Santo. ‘Welcome to Paradise, boys and girls!’ boasts Julian. Entering the mansion, Julian calls out ‘Thomas! I’m home!’ Wither asks Julian who Thomas is, and Julian explains that Thomas is their butler, adding that he hopes his Mom and Dad didn’t give him the month off. Mercury tells Julian that it is no big deal, as she is sure they can manage without a butler.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Julian sees his father standing on the landing and is confused, telling his father that he thought he was on vacation. ‘Clearly. I see you’ve invited some…friends’ states Mr. Keller, before rhetorically asking Julian if he called their lawyer, invoking their connections. ‘But, Dad…’ Julian begins to protests, until his father asks confirms that it was to get he and his friends off the hook for fighting with airport security. ‘What were you thinking?’</p><p> </p><p>Julian’s father tells his son to come with him, as he and Julian’s mother need to talk with him. Julian protests that he wants to get his friends set up - ‘NOW!’ is his father’s reply. Sooraya suggests to her teammates that it might be best if they leave, but Rockslide declares that she must be kidding, as he wants to check out the swimming pool!</p><p> </p><p>In the dinning room, Julian sits slumped at the table as his father tells him that he dragged their names through the mud today. Julian exclaims that he has already tried telling him that they wouldn’t let he and his friends go on the plane. ‘Always making trouble’ mutters Mr. Keller before pointing out that Julian’s brother, James, is off in New York managing their business, before asking Julian what it is he is doing. ‘I’m sixteen. I can’t work in the business, I have to go to school!’ Julian points out.</p><p> </p><p>‘Yes. A very special school,’ mutters Mr. Keller, while Julian protests that he has to go there as he needs to master his powers. ‘So you can create scenes at the airport?’ asks Julian’s father, before telling Julian that he has no sense of discretion and that he is very fortunate his mutation is easily hidden, that he can pass as human. ‘I shouldn’t have to!’ declares Julian. Julian’s father suggests to him that he could use his power only when he needs to, that he could keep it hidden, before pointing out that he doesn’t think, that he has no sense of the bigger picture.</p><p> </p><p>Julian’s mother explains to her son that what his father is trying to say is that they fear he does not have his brother’s sensibility. ‘I’m not James, Mom’ mutters Julian. Mrs. Keller understands that, and tells Julian that he will walk his own path, before standing by her husband and informing Julian that they have worked too hard for everything they have - they cannot risk that. Julian asks his parents what it is they are saying, and his father reveals that they have reworked their will, informing Julian that his brother will now be inheriting the family business and the family money.</p><p> </p><p>‘You can’t do that!’ Julian yells, before turning to his mother for support. Mrs. Keller tells Julian that it is not the end of the world, that they are still his family and his is still welcome here, as are his friends, but that they need to protect their assets.</p><p> </p><p>Shortly, Dust watches from behind a shrub as the Kellers go to their limousine. Julian’s mother exclaims that she cannot wait to be on that beach, as her nerves are so frayed. ‘Soon, dear,’ her husband says.</p><p> </p><p>At the swimming pool, Rockslide yells ‘Cannonball!’ as his leaps into the water, creating a huge splash. Dust cautiously approaches her teammates as Brian complains that they are wet. ‘Yeah, like they don’t have towels in this place’ jokes Santo. Dust informs her teammates that it appears Julian’s parents are leaving, when suddenly there is a loud crash. Cessily suggests that they go and check on Julian.</p><p> </p><p>Running inside the mansion, Tag calls out to Julian, asking him if he is okay. ‘Fine. Why do you ask?’ responds Julian, standing in the middle of a ransacked room. Cessily tells him that they heard a crash, before asking what happened. Julian turns to the computer in the room as he declares that he needs to find a lawyer, revealing to his teammates that his parents have disinherited him. Kevin asks if it is because of them, but Julian declares that it is because of nothing, before muttering that they think they can just cut him off, well he is going to fight.</p><p> </p><p>Julian tells his teammates that they have to help him, they have to find something they can use. ‘Like what? Something illegal?’ asks Brian, before pointing out that Julian said his parents earned their money. ‘Yeah, right’ mutters Kevin, exclaiming that no one gets that rich that quick, and tells his team that they are going to go through everything, before asking ‘Why are you guys so wet?’</p><p> </p><p>Shortly, the Hellions are pouring through various folders and files, Tag asks Julian if his parents spent ten thousand dollars on his twelfth birthday. ‘You don’t know parties in L.A. - it’s hard to compete’ replies Hellion as he searches along a blank wall for something, mumbling that he knows it is here somewhere. Cessily finds a file that says eighteen months before Julian’s twelfth birthday they only made thirty thousand dollars for the year, and asks how they can go from that to ten thousand dollar parties.</p><p> </p><p>Searching some files on the computer, Wither informs everyone that Julian’s parents company went international a few months after the party, remarking that it is a quick turn around. Julian smiles as he discovers what he was looking for - his parents’ safe! It opens, and Julian pulls from it some documents. ‘The “Kingmaker”? You gotta be kidding me. What were my parents mixed up with?’ he asks.</p><p> </p><p>Soon, Julian has set up six candles in a circle and stands over them. Sooraya tells him that she is not sure this is a wise idea, but Julian exclaims that he doesn’t know if this scroll is a joke, or if his parents have serious secrets, but either way, wants to find out. Sooraya points out that he could be disturbing dangerous forces, but Julian assures Dust that if this Kingmaker was dangerous then his parents wouldn’t have had the stones to deal with him.</p><p> </p><p>Cessily informs Hellion that she has found the sage and thyme, and Wither has the matches. Julian asks where Brian and Santo are, as Sooraya tries to talk him out of it, but is interrupted by the arrival of Tag and Rockslide who have brought chips and sodas. Dust approaches Cessily and asks her to explain to Julian - but Cessily interrupts Dust before she can tell her what to explain. Mercury tells Sooraya to relax, which is what vacation is for. She points out that Julian doesn’t seem upset anymore and if doing some silly spell takes his mind off his parents, where is the harm?</p><p> </p><p>Kevin agrees with Cessily, and asks Sooraya if she has ever heard of a spell that involves candles, spices and a phone. ‘How real could this thing be?’ Julian, Tag and Santo take their places around the circle and tell the others that they are ready. Kevin and Mercury sit down, but Dust remains standing, until Julian tells her that it will be fine.</p><p> </p><p>Julian explains to everyone that they have to light a candle, place the sage in a circle around the candle and sprinkle the thyme into the flame. Sooraya remarks that she is still unsure, as Julian picks up the phone and dials the number that was listed on the scroll. Placing the phone back on the ground, a voice states ‘You have attempted to contact the Kingmaker. Please speak your name’. ‘Julian Keller’ ‘Brian Cruz’ ‘Santo Vaccarro’ ‘Cessily Kincaid’ ‘Kevin Ford’ and finally a reluctant Dust: ‘…Sooraya…Qadir…’. There is silence. ‘Now what?’ asks Tag.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning: The guys are in the kitchen having breakfast, and someone remarks ‘That was totally lame’. Julian agrees, declaring that he should have known his parents weren’t cool enough to be mixed up in magic. Julian smiles when Cessily and Sooraya enter. Julian greets them and asks Sooraya if she slept well, reminding her that he told her nothing bad would happen. Dust thanks Julian and replies that she slept well. Cessily asks Julian if he is feeling any better, when the doorbell rings.</p><p> </p><p>Hellion tells Mercury that his parents will come around, that they always do, before exclaiming that he is going to take everyone out today and show them L.A. as his parents left some cash behind. Julian opens the door, ‘Mr Keller? Julian Keller?’ ‘Yeah, can I help you?’ asks Julian. ‘You called. I am the Kingmaker’. Julian and the other Hellions stand wide-eyed as a well-dressed man enters the mansion, informing them that they are each granted on wish - whatever their heart’s desire. ‘So choose now, the clock is ticking…’.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i><b>Overview</b></i></p> <p>Planet Hulk: Allegiance, Part 4</p> <p>The wedding of the Hulk! That’s right. In an effort to keep peace amongst the different races of Sakaar, Hulk smashes but he also loves…and takes a queen. As PLANET HULK moves toward its monumental end and WORLD WAR HULK looms on the horizon, don’t dare miss this critical moment of what may be the Hulk’s most epic tale! <br /></p> <p><br /><b><i>Spoilers</i></b><br /><br />After liberating the planet Sakaar, the Hulk has been made an emperor. He continues to let the parasitic species, the Spikes, drain energy off of him for their help in overthrowing the Red King and to prevent them from feeding on the innocent. Bruce Banner is briefly seen after the Spikes feed on the Hulk for over seven hours.<br /></p> <p>There is still some hostility as the Red King's former soldiers still fight against the new regime. Soon a fight breaks out among two of Hulk's group, Elloe and Miek. The solution is to fight to the death in the arena. As the fight begins, Hulk jumps down and starts fighting them. He tells them to fight him or die. Knowing that would be futile, they follow his order to embrace each other rather than have Hulk kill them.</p> <p>The Elders of the Shadow People meet with Hulk later to discuss the treaty they had with the Red King. Rather than retain the Shadow Guard, Hulk's only wish was to have a queen.</p> <p>Hulk and Caiera soon complete the Shadow Ceremony. Caiera asks to know all of Hulk and he transforms into Banner. Hulk wanted her to see all of him. Approving, the ceremony continues.</p> <p>As the people get their queen, Brood and Miek, upset at being <i>forgotten</i> for the time, decide to get a little action of thier own. As they are engaged, they discover the shuttle that Hulk arrived in that the Red King had ordered his men to salvage after Hulk arrived. A recording by Reed Richards, Doctor Strange, and Iron Man can be seen where they aplogize to Hulk for betraying him. It seems that it will be time for Hulk to remember that betrayal.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The Inhumans are betrayed by one of their own. If their culture is to survive, Black Bolt must find Quicksilver. On Earth the word is out – Quicksilver is promising to restore lost powers to former mutants, and Magneto is not happy.</em></p><p>Genosha. Pietro remembers… </p><p>He explains the island state was once home to millions of mutants. This is where his father’s dream of power became reality, until Cassandra Nova, the evil twin sister to Professor Xavier, unleashed the Sentinels, and the dream was trampled beneath their iron feet. Pietro and Wanda gave Magneto his dream back. For a while, Genosha was the glittering jewel in the crown of their dad’s mutant empire. It was Pietro’s gift to him, and he threw it back in son’s face.</p><p>Pietro remembers how everything fell apart, and Magneto hang there in mid-air in front of him, furiously shouting at him what Pietro has done in his name. On that moment, Wanda said the magic words: “no more mutants.” Magneto ended up losing his powers, just like Pietro and Wanda themselves, and their dad finally knew despair. Today, of the sixteen million who once lived on Genosha, all that remain are a few demoralized former mutants.</p><p>Quicksilver has gathered these mutants around him, and explains to Wicked, Hub, Unus, Hack, Purge, Freakshow and Shola that he and Luna are offering them their powers back. All they have to do is say “yes.” It’s as simple as that. Wicked knows nothing is ever as simple as that. Hub wants to know why they are chosen, as there are millions of de-powered mutants all over the world. Unus asks Pietro where Magneto is, and if he knows what Pietro is doing. Hack thinks the discussion is stupid, and doesn’t see why they shouldn’t just trust Quicksilver. Freakshow reminds his friends that either way, they are running out of canned food. Shola recalls that Pietro told them those Mists restored his powers and asks for a demonstration.</p><p>Pietro agrees to give them that. He explains that before he... changing his phrase, Pietro states that, before M-Day, he was fast. Shola smiles that they all know that. But after that certain day, Pietro states, he was no faster than anyone else. Until he was exposed to the Terrigen Mists. To himself, Pietro concludes that actually, his powers are a trick of sorts. He time-jumps an hour into the future, walks a few yards and returns to the present. He demonstrates this power to the former mutants, and makes it seem like he has quickly ran behind them.</p><p>Purge is impressed at the speed. Wicked agrees to do it and inhales the Mists. Pietro explains the process will only take a few minutes. Hack asks Wicked if anything is happening. Wicked touches her head, and is thrilled when she sees her spirits are floating all around her again! Freakshow inhales the Mists next and transforms into a huge dragon. Purge gets his enhanced strength back, but Shola isn’t sure if he wants to do this. His explains his power has drawbacks. Every time he slept, he relived the death of one of the millions who died there. He thinks that, if he gets his power back, the nightmares probably return as well.</p><p>Wicked tells Shola it’s his choice to make. Personally, she would think having power to knock over tall buildings is worth a little pain. Purge tries to encourage Shola to inhale the stuff. He doesn’t know what’s in those Mists, but he never felt so pumped up before! A happy Wicked shouts this is so cool, as she has missed her spirit guys. Purge jokes to Shola that he hears Wicked admitting she digs rotting dead people. While Unus inhales the Mists next, Purge thinks this is a question of attitude. He thinks Shola just has to tell himself dead people are good and that they are his friends.</p><p>Pietro asks Luna if she sees it now. This is just the beginning. Soon as all the former mutants of the world will flock to him, he will restore them all. Luna takes off her sunglasses and her eyes glow. She thinks something is wrong. Wicked suddenly hears some spirits calling her a “wicked girl.” The scared girl turns around, and sees the spirits of... her parents?! Her dad wants to know why his daughter left them to die. Her mom states she always knew Wicked was a nasty, selfish little tramp. Wicked shouts she didn’t summon her parents and wants them to go back where they came from. Her dad doesn’t want his girl to tell them what to do. Wicked draws her parent’s spirits back inside her.</p><p>Hack asks her if she’s okay. Wicked mentions this wasn’t supposed to happen, as she doesn’t want her parents back. Pietro tries to calm Wicked down by saying she doesn’t have to worry about the few anomalies in her restored powers. Suddenly, a voice demands that Pietro tells the mutants the truth. It’s Magneto! Magneto, holding an unconscious Callisto in his arms, wants Pietro to admit that the Mists of Terrigen aren’t a cure, but instead a <em>curse</em>! He informs everyone that his son Pietro has poisoned them all!</p><p><em>Meanwhile, on Attilan, homeland of the Inhumans... </em></p><p>A heavily beaten up Jolen reveals to the Royal family that it was Pietro who murdered Goran and stole the Terrigen Mists. Medusa wonders how that’s possible, as Pietro went back to Earth ten days ago. How could he return there without their knowledge? Jolen says that Pietro has his powers again, but not just the speed. He can reproduce himself. He explains that, while Quicksilver was fighting him, there were three Pietro present! The three Pietro attacked without warning and beat Jolen up. Then, they vanished.</p><p>Gorgon wants to know if Pietro came for the crystals, he wonders why Pietro attacked Jolen. Crystal thinks it’s because Pietro is petty and jealous and spiteful. Gorgon doesn’t understand, but Medusa doesn’t think that’s important now. Their main concern is that Pietro can apparently teleport here from Earth at will. Videmus denies that. Pietro doesn’t teleport: he simply travels through time. He reveals Pietro was exposed to the Mists several weeks ago. They restored Pietro’s speed in a new form. He stole the crystals while he was still in Attilan, by traveling through time. Pietro took them when he left with Luna.</p><p>Gorgon becomes angry hearing that Pietro has had the crystals on Earth all this time, and that Videmus knew about it but didn’t say anything. Medusa tells Videmus that his king wishes to communicate with them. Videmus attaches his eyes on Black Bolt’s head, so they can telepathically communicate with another. Black Bolt wants to know why Videmus did this, because he thought that of all his subjects, he thought he knew Videmus best. In that case, Videmus says, Black Bolt knows he had the welfare of their people at heart. Black Bolt asks how that can be, as he doesn’t see what they are without Terrigenesis. He reminds Videmus he has endangered the very thing that makes them Inhuman!</p><p>Videmus denies that. He tells his lord that it requires more than a chemical process to make an Inhuman. Their race was forged in the heat of conflict, and that is what made them so strong. Videmus feels that here on Earth’s moon, Black Bolt has created a sanctuary. He has made everyone safe. And what, he asks, do they do in their complacency? They eat, drink and make merry! The young Inhumans know no challenge beyond the rivalry of the sports arena. Their battle skills degenerate. Videmus fears that, soon, their culture will be as barren as this dead rock on which they are squatting. He thinks he has given their people a reason to live. Now, they will experience the exhilaration of an uncertain place. Terrigenesis is not their right; it is a privilege, which should be earned through struggle and hardship.</p><p>Black Bolt asks Videmus if he thinks war is the glorious end he seeks. Videmus states he knows his lieges heart. He knows it irks him to be surrounded by pomp and opulence, that a life of ease doesn’t become him. Videmus feels he has given Black Bolt what his heart desires. Black Bolt angrily shouts at Videmus he doesn’t know him. How can he think that he would thank Videmus for this?! He demands that Videmus speaks, as he will pronounce his judgment on him.</p><p>Videmus knows that Black Bolt would have him condemned for his crimes. He promises to live out his natural life in solitary confinement. And, Videmus shall never again join his mind to that of another living soul, nor see again through another’s eyes. He accepts Black Bolt’s decree. Videmus takes his eyes back, and now can see nothing but black, cold space. Gorgon thinks Black Bolt is too merciful, and knows Videmus deserves death. Medusa tells Gorgon he is wrong about that. There is no mercy in Black Bolt’s judgment. As the guards take Videmus away, Crystal asks her cousins, if it isn’t too much trouble, if they will perhaps now help her find her daughter.</p><p><em>Genosha... </em></p><p>Luna happily runs towards her grandfather, and Pietro can’t stop her. Magneto is glad to see Luna again after all this time. When she wonders aloud what’s wrong with Callisto, Magneto explains to his granddaughter that Callisto told him that Pietro restored her mutant powers, but that it was different. Her senses became too acute. She couldn’t stand the pain, so she shut it out. Now, Callisto has gone into a deep coma. Pietro wants to take a closer look at Callisto, as she was fine when she left him.</p><p>Magneto angrily slaps Pietro in his face, demanding that he stays away from her. Pietro doesn’t take that slap as a surprise. After all, the last time they met, his dad tried to <em>kill</em> him. Only this time, Pietro grins, his dad isn’t Lord Magneto. He is just a man. While Pietro is so much more.</p><p>Pietro stands still, and reminds himself he has done this before with Jolen. He simply time-jumps thirty seconds into the future. Then he does it again, each time stopping at the same point in time, until two other versions of him appear to help out. All the Quicksilvers attack Magneto at once, who doesn’t understand what his son is doing. The Pietros all hit Magneto in his face, shouting at him that they owe their father this a hundred times over! Luna begs her dad to stop hurting her grandpa.</p><p>Shola agrees with the little girl. He doesn’t know what Pietro’s problem is, but he says Magneto has had enough. Pietro shouts that all he ever wanted to do was please his dad, but he barely acknowledge his existence! But he thinks that, now, Magneto has noticed him! Luna touches Magneto’s head. She can feel that he isn’t a bad person. He is just very sad. She glides her fingers through Magneto’s hair and sees lots of beautiful colors in him. Luna thinks she can help her grandpa out by taking away the sadness. Magneto wakes up and pushes Luna away from her, wanting her out of his head!</p><p>Luna says she was only trying to help. Magneto doesn’t want his ability to feel taken away from him! He knows Luna was shutting down parts of his mind. He doesn’t want her to do that to <em>anyone</em>. Luna wonders if that means she can’t use her powers. All of the Pietros tell Luna not to listen to Magneto. He explains she only has had her powers for a short while and is certain she will learn to use them without harming anyone. Magneto is shocked to discover Luna’s powers came from the Mists, and that Pietro used them on his own daughter. He can’t believe what kind of a monster his son has become. Quicksilver becomes furious, and doesn’t want Magneto, of all people, to tell him how to raise his child. He demands that Magneto gets out of here and crawls back into whatever rat hole he has been hiding in. He swears that if he ever sees Magneto again, he’ll kill him. Luna starts to cry and begs her dad to please not fight.</p><p>Magneto agrees to leave, but only for the child’s sake. He just wants Pietro to promise he’ll take care of Callisto. He has to bring her to the mainland, as she needs to be in a hospital.</p><p><em>A day later, at the Baxter Building in New York, home to the Fantastic Four... </em></p><p>Reed explains to his team and the Inhumans that sometime yesterday, the former mutant Callisto was taken to the Victoria Hospital on Mahé Island in the Seychelles. She was teleported into the middle of downtown traffic by the Genoshan mutant Hub. Hub later told him that Callisto lost her powers on M-Day, but regained them in an extreme form after being exposed by what Hub described as “a DNA-altering drug.” Reed’s guess is that the Inhumans will find Pietro and the stolen crystals on Genosha.</p><p>Medusa thinks Luna must be on Genosha as well. Ben recalls that they may have kind of butted heads with Quicksilver a few times in the past, but he’s confident he would never hurt Luna. Johnny tells Crystal he agrees with that. Crystal thanks Johnny for that, and hopes that he is right. Johnny smiles at her. Reed mentions he should warn the Inhumans their intel comes from communications between the Seychelles and the White House. He wouldn’t normally eavesdrop on the government, but this case is different. Medusa tells Reed Black Bolt understands and appreciates the FF’s friendship. All the Inhumans do. Reed admits that the point is that they aren’t the only ones knowing what’s going on in Genosha.</p><p><em>At the same time, at the Office of National Emergency, at the Pentagon in Washington DC... </em></p><p>General Lazer finds it hard to believe they are dealing with a DNA-altering drug. One of his co-workers confirms it’s actually that. But the guy has learned that the president is concerned. He explains they have been moving towards a position where the mutant situation was becoming controllable. The president fears that, if mutants are recovering their powers, it would be considered as a setback. The man adds that the situation in Genosha introduces an unknown factor, and the president would like that factor to be contained. Lazer totally agrees. He orders to scramble the ground troops; meaning squads Delta and Gamma. And, Lazer wants his jet prepared for takeoff. He will be leading this mission personally.</p><p><em>Back to Genosha, where... </em></p><p>Karnak reads on the scanner he received from Reed that the device is picking up two major groups and a number of solitary life forms. It discovers two individuals who appear to be teleporting, and one of them is too big to be human.</p><p>Not far away from them, Lockjaw stands alone, and howls.</p><p>Karnak continues to explain that the other person seems to be jumping randomly every few seconds, and just joined the group in the buildings they can see in front of them.</p><p>Inside one of the buildings, Hub teleports back to her teammates. She falls on the ground, and Wicked asks her if she’s alright and where she has been. When Hack asks if Hub succeeded in bringing Callisto to a hospital, Hub confirms and guesses Callisto is in good hands. But it’s taken her close to twenty-four hours to get back there. Her internal radar is definitely on the blink. She reveals that, in her last attempt to teleport back there, she ended up in the middle of the ocean, about thirty yards down. She knows if she had sunk any deeper, she would have blanked out.</p><p>Wicked calls that totally dangerous. Hub tries to dry her hair, and agrees with what Wicked just said. Hack guesses Hub’s radar will come back eventually. When Hub then asks how things are going, Wicked is ashamed to say things aren’t so good. Freakshow isn’t talking, and Hack thinks the poor guy is stuck in his monstrous form now. Shola has been acting weird as well. He woke up screaming last night, and Hack thinks Shola’s nightmares are back.</p><p>Nearby, an exhausted Shola desperately tries to stay awake, in order avoid the nightmares.</p><p>Pietro isn’t with them right now, and sometimes just disappears. He literally... disappears. And when the guy comes back, he just walks in like nothing happened. Purge is creeped out by Quicksilver. They all look at Luna, who keeps inhaling the Mists. Hack mentions that he heard Pietro talking about giving them all a second hit. He figures it will fix the glitches with their powers.</p><p>Suddenly, a large shadow appears above the youngsters. It’s an attacking Black Bolt! The Inhumans follow after their king and surround them. Crystal demands to know where her daughter, Luna, is. An angry Gorgon is eager to fight Pietro. Wicked asks her friends what they are going to do about this. Shola appears, and is certain the Inhumans will take back the Mists. Freakshow hears that and doesn’t like it, fearing that means he’ll stay trapped in his current ugly form. The kids open fire on the Inhumans, and the battle quickly rages on.</p><p>Pietro grabs Luna and tells her they need to leave. The two run away, and don’t notice they are being watched by Lazer and his troops. Lazer orders one of his agents to take Quicksilver out, and Pietro gets shot! He falls on the ground, dropping the container holding the Mists. Luna panics, but Lazer meets up with her and tells her it’s okay: they are Americans. Luna can’t believe they just hurt her father. She takes off her sunglasses and, with glowing eyes, stares at Lazer, promising he’s going to be sorry he just did that.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Just how far will Pietro go to restore the powers of former mutants? As Inhumans battle the last surviving Genoshans the consequences prove to be horrific. Don’t miss this one. The repercussions from this finale will echo into CIVIL WAR in the months to come...</em></p><p>The island of Genosha… </p><p>Luna shouts at General Lazer and his soldiers, who shot her father in the back. This confirms what she always heard from her cousin, Gorgon: that humans aren’t real warriors. One of the soldiers reads that it looks like Luna has powers and asks if he should take her out as well. Luna, with glowing eyes, hears that the soldier is afraid of her and stares at him. The soldier looks Luna in her eyes, and freaks out. He states he isn’t afraid of her at all, and on his knees begs for forgiveness and doesn’t want to be hurt.</p><p>Lazer explains to Luna that her father isn’t injured. He was shot with a tranquilizer pellet to make him sleep. He promises the pellet barely penetrated Quicksilver’s skin. But, Lazer also promises Luna that, if she uses her powers on one of his soldiers again, his men will open fire and their weapons <em>will</em> fire bullets. Luna can’t believe the soldiers would shoot children. Lazer states he wouldn’t have Luna shot; but the same thing doesn’t count for Pietro! Luna’s eyes start to glow again. Lockjaw appears behind the soldiers and angrily growls and attacks them!</p><p>Luna asks Lockjaw to teleport them out of there. Quicksilver gets up, and asks Luna to wait. They can’t leave the crystals behind. However, Lockjaw does as told and teleports himself, Luna and Pietro away; without the crystals. Lazer picks up the container holding the crystals, concluding it looks like they’ve got what they came for.</p><p>None of the soldiers nor Lazer realize that, not far away, a quiet Magneto stands on a hill and has seen everything that happened.</p><p><em>Nearby... </em></p><p>Medusa tells the combatants that this battle is futile, explaining the Inhumans simply want what is theirs. Unus mocks that, in that case, the Inhumans should have asked nicely because they are on Genosha now, which is <em>his</em> land. He attacks Karnak, who tries to hit him, but misses. Unus grins that his full name is “Unus the Untouchable.” Karnak continues to try to hit him, but Unus simply doesn’t get hurt. Karnak thinks this is impossible, saying that no barrier is without a flaw, and that no shield is unbreakable.</p><p>Unus continues to smile at his victory, but then something weird happens to him. A pink glow starts to surround Angelo’s body, and he can’t breathe anymore. His force field starts covering up his entire body, and he can’t get out! Hub tends to him and asks Hack if he can mind-link with Unus, but the boy can’t. Unus’ force field is keeping him out. Hack thinks this has happened before. Unus has lost control of his powers, and it’s blocking everything: sound, air, even light waves. Hack begs for everyone to stop fighting and tells them that Unus is dying!</p><p>Karnak places his hands on Unus’ force field, offering his help. Hub smiles it’s okay now, noticing that Unus’ force field is already shutting off again. Hack thinks he knows why: it’s because Unus is dead. Shola is freaked out by this. He never really liked Unus, but wouldn’t have wished him to die like this.</p><p>With Black Bolt standing behind her, Medusa apologizes for what happened, but thinks the former mutants now know why the Terrigen Mists never should be used on humans. They’ve got to have them back. Magneto meets up with them, and explains to the Inhumans that the crystals are gone. Medusa asks Magneto where he has taken them. Magneto states he has no use for the crystals, as he has seen what the Terrigen Mists do to his people. He would return them to the Inhumans if he could. He explains that there are soldiers here, and that they took the crystals with them.</p><p>Gorgon wants to know what kind of soldiers were there. Magneto informs it were Americans, who looked like some kind of special forces. When Crystal asks Magneto if he has seen Luna, he explains to Crystal that Lockjaw took her along with Pietro. Crystal asks if her daughter is all right, which Eric confirms. Medusa states that if the Mists are no longer on Genosha, their quarrel with Magneto is over. Gorgon, however, wants to know where the soldiers are now.</p><p>Suddenly, Lazer and his troops stand right behind the Inhumans and the others! Lazer thinks they are dealing with an invasion force, however Magneto reminds Lazer that this isn’t U.S. territory, and thinks he could ask Lazer the same question. Lazer corrects he was talking about an invasion of Earth. Medusa explains they are on a diplomatic mission, and are simply there to retrieve stolen cultural artifacts. One of the soldiers finds the body of the dead Unus, and informs Lazer about this.</p><p>Lazer jokes the Inhumans have a strange idea of diplomacy. Medusa explains Unus died as a result of his illicit use of the Terrigen crystals. Lazer believes the crystals sound dangerous. Medusa confirms the Mists are just that, but only in the wrong hands. That’s why they demand the crystal’s immediate return. Lazer refuses to give the crystals back, proclaiming they are now in the custody of the Office of National Emergency. He can’t release the Mists without presidential authority. In that case, Medusa suggests Lazer gets just that, and quick.</p><p>First, Lazer wants his men to escort the former mutants away from Genosha, noticing they need medical attention. Shola refuses to go. Lazer doesn’t want to be argued with. He promises they’ll take them all to the same hospital that is treating their friend Callisto. Wicked believes they should go, telling Shola there’s noting on Genosha for them anymore. Purge also agrees, looking at how his power is out of control. He feels bad. Medusa agrees for Lazer to take the kids, as they have no further dispute with them. But she wants to know Lazer’s answer: will he return the crystals to them? Lazer mentions he’ll contact the president’s office, and the Inhumans will have their answer shortly.</p><p><em>Soon afterward... </em></p><p>While soldiers help the big Freakshow into a helicopter, the others take goodbye from Magneto. Shola asks Magneto if he’ll leave with them. Magneto refuses to leave the only home he has. Wicked states that Genosha is their home as well, and promises they’ll soon be back. They all step into helicopters as well, which take off.</p><p>One of the soldiers informs Lazer they’ve got confirmation from U.S.S. Kilgore, that an F-16 has just taken off with the container on board. Lazer thinks they better go give the high-and-mighty Inhumans their answer. The president refuses to give them the crystals back! Lazer explains that the president considers the crystals a threat to national security, and they will remain in United States custody. He asks the Inhumans if they’ll agree to return to Attilan now. Medusa sees Black Bolt thinking about it, and tells the soldiers they’ll have their answer shortly.</p><p>Black Bolt goes to stand on a hill to think things over. Lazer becomes impatient and wants to know what Black Bolt is waiting for, however the soldiers remind Lazer he knows they wouldn’t stand a chance in a firefight with the Inhumans. Lazer tells the soldiers Black Bolt is a head of state on foreign soil. He knows he isn’t going to commit an act of aggression against representatives of the U.S.A. Another soldier sees the Inhumans leaving in another ship. Lazer is surprised they’re actually leaving. “Oh my God”, Lazer realizes. “Black Bolt’s answer!” He immediately orders his troops to scramble the choppers and to evacuate immediately.</p><p>Black Bolt, looking at the helicopters, quietly whispers the word “war.” On that moment, the helicopters explode, immediately killing the soldiers within! The nearby environment is also devastate by the blast. Lazer, himself, however, has survived the explosions, and walks away. Black Bolt looks down dejectedly, not too happy about this.</p><p>Nearby, Magneto crawls out of some ruins. It starts to rain. Magneto stares disappointed in front of him.</p><p><em>California... </em></p><p>Quicksilver, Luna and Lockjaw arrive back at Pietro’s beach house. Pietro tells Luna it’s all right, as they are safe now, but Luna wants to go back for the crystals. Luna angrily punches Lockjaw in his face for leaving the crystals behind. Pietro tries to calm her down, but Luna wants to go back as she feels sick. Pietro tells Luna to listen to him: there are crystals here, as he kept enough for the two of them. Luna asks her dad to hurry back.</p><p>Luna stays behind on the beach, and Pietro searches his rooms for the crystals. He looks outside, and sees Luna and Lockjaw sitting next to each other. Pietro realizes what he must do. He goes outside, and lies to Luna that the crystals will be ready in a little while. She just needs to be patient. Luna agrees. Pietro whispers to Lockjaw that he has to take Luna back to her mother. Lockjaw understands. He goes to stand behind Luna and, as her eyes glow, he grabs her. Lockjaw starts teleporting away, and Luna starts to panic. She doesn’t want to leave her dad behind. But, before Lockjaw teleports them away, Luna’s final words to Pietro are that she loves him.</p><p>Left behind all alone, Pietro stares sad at the ocean.</p><p><em>New York, the Baxter Building... </em></p><p>Reed tells Medusa this is the last time he’ll intercept official messages for her. Now that Black Bolt has made a declaration of war against America, he can’t do this anymore. Medusa understands, and asks Reed what he has learned. Reed explains it looks like the Genoshan’s powers have faded. Callisto and the others are no longer mutants. It seems the effects of the Terrigen Mists on them were temporary.</p><p>Crystal asks about Luna, who sits behind her in a chair, staring outside the window. Reed explains that Luna is half-Inhuman, and was repeatedly exposed to the Mists. He thinks the Inhumans’ own healers will be better equipped to help her, and tells Crystal they should return Luna to Attilan at once. Crystal walks over to her daughter, and tells her they need to go now. Luna feels sad and thinks her dad send her away. She and her mom hug, with Crystal correcting Luna that Pietro actually sent her back.</p><p>The Fantastic Four all watch the Inhumans leave in their ship. Reed wishes Medusa well, and can only hope this mess can be cleared up. It’s hard to believe that their two nations could go to war over so little. Medusa corrects that for the Inhumans, the situation isn’t so little. Wars have been wage for far less. She promises that if the crystals are returned to them, the war can be ended. Reed is afraid they will all have difficult choices to make in the months ahead. In that case, Medusa can only pray that Reed will follow his heart and that the next time they meet, it won’t be as enemies. The Inhumans take off and return home.</p><p><em>Epilogue... </em></p><p>Quicksilver doesn’t know how long he has been in his room. It could have been days, weeks... or months. He has continuously been inhaling the sacred Mists of Terrigen. He has had no other sustenance, only the Mists. Their power is his own now. Pietro has made a decision. He shall travel into the future, further than he has ever gone before. All the way. He has to see. He has to konw what he has done. Pietro travels into the future, and can see nothing but a big fire around him, which also has a weird glow.</p><p>Some time later, Quicksilver, wearing a coat over his costume, walks through a city. He looks around himself and is surprised at how peaceful the world seems to be. It’s hard to believe that so much chaos is on its way. But the future he has seen cannot be changed. He accepts that. Pietro Maximoff realizes he is still the son of Magneto, and will have his place in the world.</p><p>He walks over to a man sitting on a bench, who acts like he’s trying to chop off his hands. Pietro thinks the man used to be a mutant. The man tries to pretend that he isn’t. He dives into the pocket of his pants, saying he’s got a card in there somewhere. He asks Pietro if he’s from the shelter, and wonders if he got lost.</p><p>Pietro touches the man’s face with his hands, which start to glow. The man becomes scared and asks Pietro what he’s doing. Quicksilver explains he’s giving the man back what he has lost. He’s showing him the way. The man’s skin starts turning grey, and black patches get formed around his eyes. One of his hands turns into a scythe, and a mutant’s powers have been restored!</p><p>Quicksilver continues his route, and states that, if he cannot change the future... he shall embrace it.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The Hellions are faced with the ultimate temptation: one wish each, a whole new life. What will they wish for? And what will it cost them?</em></p><p>The Californian Desert: From a ridge, the former member of the Serpent Society known as Diamondback, and the mercenary Paladin look down on a facility surrounded by a fence. In the middle of no where, it seems that this facility, dubbed “Genetassist” is not meant to be spied upon by those as dubious as Diamondback and Paladin. Paladin points out that security is low, while Diamondback mocks the facilities name, for she knows that what is being designed in there is as lethal as a nuclear warhead. Diamondback asks Paladin if he knows what this would go for on the Black Market, to which he replies that he knows what it is <em>worth</em>, why else would he have taken the job.</p><p>Paladin asks Diamondback why she took this job, to which Diamondback snaps at him, exclaiming that this is none of his business, ‘You’re a gun for hire, not a shrink for hire’. Paladin smiles and comments that he heard she had reformed to win the heart of Captain America, but guesses that didn’t quite work out. Diamondback confirms that she did go legit for Cap, but what can she say? He was her heart’s desire back then, ‘But my heart grew up, you know? And we don’t always get what we want.’ Unbeknownst to Diamondback and Paladin, while they are watching Genetassist, someone else is watching them.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Los Angles, at the Keller Mansion, the Xavier Institute students known collectively as the Hellions have just been visited by the mysterious being known as the Kingmaker, who has come to grant their wishes. Sooraya “Dust” Qadir turns away from the Kingmaker, declaring that she wants nothing, so she can be counted out of the deal. ‘Everybody wants something,’ the Kingmaker says to Sooraya, reminding the Hellions that they called him, and he has told them what he can do - one wish, their hearts desire and he can make it happen.</p><p>The Kingmaker takes a flower out of a vase and remarks that for some of them, their wish is already clear to him, and turning to Kevin “Wither” Ford, he asks him if he wishes he could turn his power off, to make physical contact again. Kevin closes his eyes and turns his face to the floor, as the flower brushes up against his face, he asks the Kingmaker how he knew. The Kingmaker reminds the Hellions that they all left their names, and remarks that he does research before he takes on new clients.</p><p>The Kingmaker points out that time is money and reminds the Hellions that they all have something they want, ‘I can give it to you!’ The usually reserved Dust points out that of course he will want something in return, ‘Things like this are never free!’ The Kingmaker smiles and states that of course it is not free, ‘What kind of businessman do you take me for?’ He explains that his clients form a vast network, they help him grant the wishes, and in return theirs are helped to be granted by others, so everyone wins.</p><p>Dust declares that she is still wary, so the Kingmaker turns to leave, suggesting to the Hellions that in the future they do not waste his time with prank phone calls. Santo “Rockslide” Vaccarro asks about the rest of them, but the Kingmaker informs him that it is all or nothing, as they all called him together. Julian Keller, appropriately codenamed Hellion and the leader of the group puts a hand on Dust’s shoulder, and asks what if the Kingmaker could give them a demonstration, at no cost, just to prove he is as good as he says.</p><p>The Kingmaker smiles wickedly and announces that it is completely workable, but Sooraya is still unsure. Julian points out that it is fair, as it is only a test, with no strings attached. Sooraya narrows her eyes and remarks that so long as they can back out. ‘Excellent. Who’s first?’ asks the Kingmaker. Sooraya closes her eyes and everyone else looks around nervously, except for Rockslide, who smiles and exclaims that he has got a wish.</p><p>The next day, Rockslide is at the center of a wrestling ring, with hundreds of spectators, all watching him as he holds his opponent high above him. The commentator exclaims that it looks like Rockslide is the real deal, as he has got Strongarm helpless! Watching ringside, the Hellions flank the Kingmaker, and Julian remarks that he cannot believe this is what Santo wished for. The Kingmaker explains that this is wrestling for hyper-powered individuals, where his strength will be respected and his appearance is not viewed as outlandish.</p><p> </p><p>The Kingmaker reveals that Santo will have his shot at the title this Summer, and then he will be a legend. Cessily “Mercury” Kincaid remarks to Julian that she thought wrestling was fake, to which Julian replies that this one isn’t, as it is real street fighting for supers, not to mention it is Santa’s favorite - who knew the Kingmaker had access? Brian “Tag” Cruz informs the Kingmaker that he knows what he wants, and whispers it in his ear. The Kingmaker tells Brian that he can do better than that.</p><p> </p><p>Kevin looks at Sooraya and asks her what she thinks now, to which the level-headed Dust replies that Santo does not seem to have the troubles that they have, as she would never have wished for this, adding that she is still not sure she will wish for anything.</p><p> </p><p>Back in the ring, Strongarm leaps down at Santo, boasting that no rookie is going to beat him. Suddenly, one of Rockslide’s hands is shot-off from the rest of his body and smacks Strongarm in the face, knocking him to the floor. ‘Dude, I don’t even need my whole body to beat ya! Santo exclaims. ‘Did you see what he did?’ someone in the astonished crowd exclaims, and after three seconds, Strongarm does not tap back in, which means Santo is the winner. The crowd goes wild, and begin chanting ‘Rockslide! Rockslide! Rockslide!’ The Kingmaker smiles, and turning to the five other Hellions, asks them who is next.</p><p> </p><p>Later, in Portland, Oregon. Cessily has arrived home. A taxi pulls out of her parents driveway, but she just stands in front of the house. Suddenly, her mother and father open the door and rush over to her. ‘We’re so glad you decided to come home!’ Cessily’s father tells her, and as her mother hugs her, Cessily asks if they are okay with her being here, to which her father replies of course they are, and asks her if she is here for the rest of the Summer. Cessily’s mother smiles and tells her that she looks good, which surprises Cessily, nevertheless, she thanks her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, a neighbor calls over the fence, ‘Hey, Mark! That your daughter? Haven’t seen her in years!’ Cessily apologizes to her parents and exclaims that she doesn’t want to cause a scene, so heads inside quickly. Mark Kincaid tells his daughter not to, as it is time they faced up to this, and calls to his neighbor, Frank, asking him if he remembers his daughter, Cessily. With eyes downcast, Cessily is brought to the fence, and the slightly stunned Frank asks when it was that she turned that color. ‘Our daughter’s a mutant, Frank. There. I said it. She’s a mutant’ Mrs. Kincaid states, before adding that she hopes it won’t be a problem.</p><p> </p><p>Nervously, Frank replies that he has got no problem but has to go now. Mark grabs Cessily’s suitcase and remarks that it didn’t go as bad as he thought, as Cessily’s mother wraps and arm around her and leads them inside, suggesting that Cessily get unpacked and then they can go out and do some shopping, have some lunch, make a whole day of it. Cessily is surprised by this, and smiles, before her mother asks her about her school and friends. Mercury replies that her friends are the same, although they do have a new guy in their group who she thinks is really cool - Kevin.</p><p> </p><p>Back at the Keller Mansion, Kevin stands nervously beside the large swimming pool, while Julian and Brian lie on sun chairs wearing just their shorts. Julian asks Kevin why he has got such a long face, and suggests that he can and lounge in the sun with them. ‘Yeah, ‘cause I’m dressed to get a tan’ Kevin replies sarcastically, motioning to his well-covered body, to which Brian suggests that he could at least lose a few layers, as the chairs are plastic.</p><p> </p><p>Concerned for his teammate, Julian assures Wither that the Kingmaker will come though, as he has a good feeling about him. A courier arrives at the gate, and asks the young men if any of them are Kevin Ford. Kevin makes himself known and the courier hands him a package. Suddenly, a dog enters the yard and starts barking at the courier. Julian explains that the dog belongs to his neighbor, adding that he hates it. Examining the package, Kevin holds a jar labelled <em>Benetech Cure Mark II</em>, and exclaims that he thinks it is from the Kingmaker - it’s the cure!</p><p> </p><p>Later, Julian and Brian are waiting outside for Kevin still, so Brian calls to him, pointing out that it has been half an hour, just like the prescription said. When the neighbors dog starts barking again, Julian exclaims that it wont shut up. When Kevin emerges from the mansion in the same protective clothing he was wearing, Julian reminds him that he was supposed to change, dress into natural fibers to test it out. Kevin explains that he is scared to test it, as he doesn’t want it to fail.</p><p> </p><p>Tag points out that Wither just has to touch something alive to see what happens. ‘But not me’ remarks Hellion, as the dog starts running towards them, he exclaims ‘bad dog! This isn’t your house!’ The dog rushes to Kevin, who shouts ‘Get back! No…don’t!’ but the dog leaps onto Kevin - and starts liking his face. Julian points out that he is touching him and nothing is happening. Tag congratulates Kevin as it worked, adding that it is another wish granted.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, at the Maslak Refugee Camp in Western Afghanistan. Sooraya sits in the back of a jeep, remarking that she does not understand how this is possible. The Kingmaker replies that travel permits were easy, as was acquiring the jeep, and while information about the refugees was difficult, it was not impossible. Many refugees gather around the jeep, and motioning to another woman, also dressed in a black burka, the Kingmaker announces that he believe he has solved Sooraya’s family problem, adding that in time, he might be able to arrange for her mother to emigrate to the States.</p><p> </p><p>Eyes-wide, Sooraya calls to her mother. The older woman lowers her face covering, surprised to see her daughter. Sooraya hugs her mother and tells the Kingmaker that she doesn’t know how to thank him. Getting back into the jeep, the Kingmaker tells her not to worry, as she will soon now.</p><p> </p><p>Back in California, this time in Hollywood, Julian and Brian are on an outing, and Julian mutters that he wants to know when it is time for their wishes to be granted, before informing Brian that Cessily called to say her parents are suddenly all over her, proud to show her off, and adds that Kevin is losing the whole “goth thing”, not to mention Santo has a big fight coming up, and the last he heard, Sooraya was being taken to see her mother. ‘What about us?!’</p><p> </p><p>Brian ignores Hellion’s complaining and simply asks him what he wished for. ‘Fortune and glory, man’, claiming that they are the “basics”, before asking Tag what he wished for, adding that he heard the Kingmaker comment that his wish sucked. Tag repliers that he changed his, that it is no big deal. Julian motions to someone getting out of a limo who is suddenly surrounded by reporters, cameras and other people. He smiles and says again that fortune and glory are the way to go.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Tag turns their attention to the rooftop, where a sniper is aiming his weapon at the Governor. Hellion flies up, telling Tag to warn the Governor, while he deals to this. Using his formidable telekinesis, Julian creates a force field, blocking the bullets entry. ‘Uh-uh, pal’ Hellion exclaims, before asking the sniper if he doesn’t like the Governor, and suggesting that this is a little much. Julian uses his telekinesis to push the sniper off the rooftop, but once separated from his rifle, Julian catches him on a telekinetic platform, telling him that he is not going to fall to his death, but go to jail.</p><p> </p><p>The Governor’s bodyguard ushers the Governor away, as a crowd of people point to the sky, one of them asking who it is up there. Hellion hovers above them, introducing himself and telling everyone not to worry, as he is on the job. ‘That’s right, H-E-L-L-I-O-N’, Julian remarks with a smile. One reporter asks him where he is from, as another asks if he is a mutant. Suddenly Brian steps forward and tells the reporters that there will be one question at a time, and points to a young woman who he seems to recognize, ‘Miss…Maltin, isn’t it?’</p><p> </p><p>The reporter smiles as she asks Hellion how he knew the Governor was in trouble. The cocky Julian replies that he is a local boy and was just showing a friend his wonderful town, when he just happened to look up, adding that if he weren’t traveling a tourist, he may never have seen the sniper. Tag asks Miss Maltin if she has a follow up, to which she points out that Hellion is not a typical super hero in costume and mask, and asks if he is just an average citizen helping out. Julian smiles and reveals that he is name is Julian Keller, adding that he has no secrets and explaining that he is a Los Angeleno born and bred, and that he wanted to just chip in.</p><p> </p><p>Soon, the interviews have finished, and Julian and Brian make their way along the street. Out of earshot, Julian asks Brian what happened back there ‘You were all over that!’ Tag reveals that the Kingmaker wanted him to make sure that Julian’s big debut went well, to which Julian asks Tag if he knew about it. Rounding a corner, Tag replies that he did and that the Kingmaker wanted Julian to look good, which is why he let Jennifer Maltin get the first couple of questions.</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer Maltin is waiting for the Julian, and Tag takes his leave, informing Julian that he will see him back home. Julian thanks Jennifer and tells her that she made it real easy for him. ‘Better than those pesky “Are you a mutant” questions, right?’ asks Jennifer, before telling Julian not to worry, for while he will have to answer those questions, now that everyone likes him, it should be much easier.</p><p> </p><p>Julian grins and says ‘Counting on a one-on-one interview, aren’t you?’ Jennifer smirks and tells Julian not to flatter himself, for while the Kingmaker wants him to be a star, she will make him a star, but as to how much they enjoy the process, that is up to them. Hands in his pockets as they walk side by side, Julian asks Jennifer if she works with the Kingmaker too. Jennifer reveals that she does, and declares that signing with him was the best decision she ever made. ‘Can you say Pulitzer Prize? I can. Thanks to him’. Julian tells Jennifer that she doesn’t need to sell him on it, for so far, he is loving this deal.</p><p> </p><p>Back in Afghanistan, Sooraya and her mother are spending time together, sheltered in a tent. Mrs. Qadir points out that her daughter is wearing her burka, and asks if she wears it in America. Sooraya informs her mother that she never wore it because of the Taliban, but because she likes the modesty and protection it affords her from the eyes of men. Mrs. Qadir smiles and tells Sooraya that it is good she is in a country where she has that choice, for here, things are better, but not all the time, and not everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Sooraya and her mother clasp hands, and with a twinkle in her eye, Sooraya informs her mother that the man who brought her here says he can help her come to America so they can be together, and asks her mother if this is something she would like. A tear falls down Mrs. Qadir’s face as she states she would love this, before asking Sooraya what it is she has to do for this man to make it possible. Sooraya smiles as she admits that she doesn’t know, before exclaiming that she now thinks it doesn’t matter what she has to do.</p><p> </p><p>Back in Los Angles at the Keller Mansion, Tag is on the phone, telling someone that Strongarm was a joke, that Rockslide needs real action. He states that he wants Rockslide against someone who matters, or else he is going to pull him out. ‘You better believe you’re gonna call me back!’ Tag shouts down the phone, and after hanging up, Santo asks him if he is sure that is going to work. Brian tells Santo to trust him, adding that the Kingmaker told him to pull out al the stops, and even gave him a look at his rolodex.</p><p> </p><p>Tag says that it is all about who you know, a “you scratch my back, I scratch yours”. Santo agrees, so long as he is known as the strongest man in the world, Brian can scratch whatever he wants. Hellion suddenly enters the room, telling his friends that his parents house has tons of cool places to hang out, and his father’s study isn’t one of them. Brian declares that he is doing business, to which Hellion smiles, before thanking Tag for hooking him up with Jennifer Maltin, ‘She’s pretty hot!’</p><p> </p><p>Brian tells Julian that he is always there for him, and that he is glad he came by, as they need to talk. ‘Have a seat’. Tag declares that today was big, that Julian captured the hearts of the media, to them, he is a hero, but that they cannot waste time, as time is money - and they have to capitalize. Julian replies that he likes the sound of that, and asks Tag what he is thinking of. Brian sits down at the desk and puts his feet up, explaining that as Julian is a public hero, they will get him on the talk show circuit, some magazine spreads, while more importantly, being public means Julian can do advertising eventually.</p><p> </p><p>Tag tells Julian that they will take care of the rest - fortune and glory. Hellion smiles and tells Tag that it is amazing, before asking him if he really thinks he can do magazines and advertising. Brian points out that there will need to be a few more heroic deeds, but with the Kingmaker’s connections, then yes. ‘It’s a scratch-your-back thing’ Santo offers. Julian tells Tag that he is ‘so the man’, before admitting that he doesn’t understand why Brian is doing all of this for him and Santo - what about his own wish? What did you wish for?</p><p> </p><p>Tag grins and reminds his friends that the Kingmaker had six wishes to grant to them, so he figured he might be able to chip in, explaining that his power to make people “It”, well, the Kingmaker is teaching him how to really make people “It”, so he is using the Kingmaker’s connections to put both Julian and Santo on the map. Julian asks Tag if that was his wish - as it sounds like the Kingmaker’s wish! Julian tells Tag he is crazy, but whatever makes him happy. Santo smiles and declares that calling the Kingmaker was the best thing the Hellions ever did!</p><p> </p><p>Back at the Kincaid household, Cessily and her father are playing a board game and her mother watches. Cessily points out that it is her father’s turn, to which Mark Kincaid jokes that Cessily is clearly anxious to beat her old man. Cessily’s mother asks her family what they would like for dinner, to which Cessily suggests they could order Chinese food. Mark agrees that is an excellent idea, when suddenly, there is a knock at the door.</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Kincaid smiles and announces that she will get it, when a well-dressed man enters the house, apologizing for disturbing them, he informs Cessily that the Kingmaker needs to see her back in L.A. as soon as possible. Mercury replies that she doesn’t understand, to which the Kingmaker’s agent informs her that the trial run is over.</p><p> </p><p>In Afghanistan, Sooraya is informed that it is time for her to return to the United States, so she and her mother hug farewell.</p><p> </p><p>Lying around on the grass wearing shorts and a t-shirt, a smiling Kevin suddenly frowns, as another agent informs Wither that the Kingmaker wants to see him.</p><p> </p><p>In his dressing room, Rockslide looks at himself in the mirror, until Tag enters and informs him that the Big Man wants him. ‘I thought I was the Big Man’ Santo replies.</p><p> </p><p>Hellion has tied some thief up at the police station and a gathering of reporters and camera people surround him, ‘All part of the friendly service!’ Hellion exclaims. However, behind him is the Kingmaker, who congratulates Julian on making the most of this - before informing him that it is time to go.</p><p> </p><p>Inside his office, the Kingmaker informs Julian that all of his friends are here, and motions him towards a conference room, adding that he will be with him shortly, as he has an important call coming in.</p><p> </p><p>Julian enters the conference room and asks Sooraya if she found her mother. Dust replies that she did and exclaims that it was wonderful. Cessily points out that Kevin is wearing shorts, to which Kevin replies it is cool. Across the table, Tag informs an eager Santo that the Champ’s is a real possibility within a month.</p><p> </p><p>In his office, the Kingmaker turns on a screen, where he is greeted by Dr. Otto Octavius - a.k.a. Dr. Octopus - on the other side. The Kingmaker asks Octavius how he may help him, to which the Spider-Man villain exclaims that he hears Genetassist has almost completed their research. The Kingmaker replies that they have, and that word has already spread - everyone is going after this and Genetassist is unprepared. Dr. Octopus snaps that he doesn’t care who else wants it, he wants it. A sombre Kingmaker looks through one-way-glass into the conference room, at the Hellions, and declares that whatever Doctor Octopus wants, he gets - ‘And I have the perfect team for the job!’</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>What if you could get anything you wanted? Well, the Hellions have. Their biggest dreams have all come true—but with a price. The Hellions are called in to recover a secret object for the mysterious Kingmaker… but what happens when they discover the nefarious plot the Kingmaker has for it?</em></p><p>The Californian Desert, more specifically, the research facilities of Genetassist. Inside the once-secure compound, security personnel lie motionless, while laser trip-wires are moved into other positions by diamonds, so a clear path can be walked. The mercenary known only as Paladin stands at a computer console, announcing that he is almost done, he just needs one more second. However Paladin may not have one more second, as he is currently being targeted - until a diamond comes to his rescue, thrown at Paladin’s assailant, it knocks him out of the vent.</p><p>The sultry Rachel Leighton a.k.a. Diamondback retrieves her diamond and tells her associate to hurry, pointing out that the are not the only ones who know Genetassist have completed their work. Paladin smiles and thanks Diamondback for the save, informing her that he just needs all the files on the project from Genetassist’s system, explaining that it doesn’t do much good to snatch the sample if more of it can be made.</p><p>Diamondback has no objections, but begins to remove her diamonds holding the laser grid in place, declaring that if others are going to be coming through the vents, then she wants this hallway secure. Paladin asks Rachel who she thinks is also after this prize. Diamondback replies A.I.M. and Hydra, as well as other big players.</p><p>Unseen to the mercenaries, the liquid-metal girl Cessily Kincaid, aptly codenamed “Mercury” begins to slide through the laser grid, and extends a hand to reach the sample Paladin and Diamondback are after. Paladin asks if this would fetch a lot in an auction, to which Rachel reminds him that they have an employer, so they get the case. Actually, Mercury now has the case, but Rachel sees her as she takes it and slides away.</p><p>Diamondback tells Paladin that they have trouble, and begins to chase the hastily-retracting Mercury, darting through the laser grid, Rachel tells Paladin to get the grid down and help her. But suddenly, Diamondback is confronted by Mercury’s teammates - the Hellions! ‘Hey now…didn’t anyone teach you that stealing is wrong?’ asks the smarmy leader Julian “Hellion” Keller.</p><p>Two hours earlier in Beverly Hills, at the office of the Kingmaker. The Hellions sit around a meeting table, discussing their recent events courtesy of the Kingmaker. Sooraya “Dust” Qadir reminds her teammates that she was sceptical at first, before exclaiming that the Kingmaker found her mother, and he thinks he can help her move to this country. Julian tells Sooraya that it is great, and asks if she is going to stay at the Xavier Institute if her mother moves here. Sooraya replies that she will have to discuss it with her mother, but it is her wish to.</p><p>Kevin “Wither” Ford sits next to Mercury and explains to her that if he takes this cure twice a day, then his death touch is off, he is just a normal guy. Pleased, Cessily asks the now casually-dressed Kevin if he can touch anyone now. ‘Anyone at all!’ replies Kevin. Santo “Rockslide” Vaccarro semi-jokes that Kevin has to get started on the touching - ‘You know what I mean? you got <em>options</em> now!’ Annoyed, Cessily gets to her feet, excusing herself she asks her teammates to tell the Kingmaker she will be back soon. Julian and Kevin look at Santo crossly. ‘What’d I say?’ Santo asks oblivious.</p><p>Outside, Cessily is sitting on her own on a park bench. Julian approaches his good friend asking her if she is okay. Cessily replies that she is happy for Kevin. Julian sits down beside Cessily and tells her that he knows she is, before knowing she thinks that it was nice when she was the only one Kevin could touch. Cessily replies it does, but that makes her a terrible person thinking like that. Julian puts his arm around his friend and tells her that it makes her a girl with a crush, and adds that he is sorry Kevin doesn’t understand that. Changing the subject, Kevin asks Cessily how her wish went, to which Cessily replies that her parents accept her for who she is, so it is great. Suddenly, the Kingmaker appears before the friends and tells them that it is time they talked.</p><p>Back in the conference room, the Kingmaker stands at the front of the table, handing out the Hellions’ contracts, he declares that it is time to put their working relationship down on paper. Rockslide asks if they have to sign in blood, to which the Kingmaker replies that they don’t, adding that he is a simple businessman. Wither is surprised, asking the Kingmaker if this means they are out of time. The Kingmaker holds onto one of Wither’s cure-vials, informing him that he will get it back once they have done him their first major favor.</p><p>The Kingmaker tells the Hellions that they have all received a wonderful test drive but now it is time to buy the car or get out. Hellion raises his hand and asks what the first favor they will be doing is. The Kingmaker asks the Hellions if they have to know before they sign, to which Sooraya points out that it seems only fair. ‘Of course it does’ replies the Kingmaker, clicking a remote, which lights up the view screen in front of the Hellions, where a large facility is shown.</p><p>The Kingmaker informs the Hellions that this building is Genetassist, a research company who work on the human genome project, adding that they are a real “help humanity” type of outfit. The Kingmaker explains that Genetassist have just finished a new project, and believes they have a leak, because everyone in the underworld wants this new project for themselves. He reveals that there are a handful of dangerous groups - terrorist groups - who may be sending people in after it, therefore he believes the project is not safe there anymore.</p><p>The Kingmaker tells the Hellions that their task is to stop the project from being stolen and bring it to him, adding that the dangerous groups will likely send operatives after it - gunmen and thieves, nothing the Hellions cannot handle. However, as the Kingmaker declares, there will also be greater threats. Two new images appear on the screen - headshots of Paladin and Diamondback.</p><p>The Kingmaker introduces Paladin, whose real name is unknown, as a mercenary with heightened strength and agility, a stun gun, and a motto being “Have gun, will travel”. Diamondback, whose real name is Rachel Leighton, is a former member of the very dangerous Serpent Society and whose current affiliation is unknown, adding that she uses an array of throwing diamonds. The Kingmaker reveals that Paladin and Diamondback have been hired to steal from Genetassist, and his sources say that they are striking tonight - so they must be stopped.</p><p>Wither points out that Diamondback reformed and was working with Captain America as a hero. ‘Was a hero. Past tense, she is a mercenary now,’ replies the Kingmaker, to which Mercury asks him why. The Kingmaker reveals that no one knows, but she is no longer with Captain America. The Kingmaker tells Cessily that as a shape-shifter, she knows how it is, that sometimes you can change to please people and they just don’t care. ‘And when that fails, you’re still the same person you always were’. Cessily tells the Kingmaker that she will do it, and signs her contract.</p><p>Wither declares that he needs the cure, as Dust exclaims that this will get her mother to America. Hellion figures that he has nothing to lose as he is a super hero now, and super heroes fight super villains. As the Hellions all sign their contracts, the Kingmaker grins. ‘Wonderful, then we have a deal’.</p><p> </p><p>Genetassist, now: Diamondback tells the Hellions that they need to hand over the case, ‘Wanna bet?’ declares Hellion. Diamondback tells Hellion that she saw him on the TV saving the governor and asks him why he is now suddenly a thief. ‘Saw me on TV? I looked good didn’t I? And you remembered me!’ exclaims Julian grinning, to which Rachel tells him to ‘Throttle down, junior,’ pointing out that this isn’t time to try and flirt with her, she suggests he hands over the case before he and his friends get in over their heads. Julian points out that it is six to one.</p><p> </p><p>‘Six to two, and we’re professionals, you’re outmatched,’ exclaims Paladin as he joins Diamondback, holding his gun out he declares that he doesn’t like shooting kids, but he is getting paid well enough to get over it. ‘So drop the case, boys and girls’. Brian points out that Paladin and Diamondback must really want the case, so it must be something major. Touching it, he uses his mutant power, announcing he just tagged it. Paladin and Rachel suddenly run from the case, ‘Must get away!’ they yell. Hellion congratulates Tag on the way he got rid of two professional baddies in seconds.</p><p> </p><p>Brian explains that he thought if they were so tough there is no point in even trying to fight them, suggesting they get going, when suddenly, a diamond strikes him in the back of the head, knocking him out. Julian calls out to his friend as Diamondback and Paladin make their re-appearance, Rachel apologizing while pointing out that Tag’s power only has so much range ‘And I’m pretty good with range’. Paladin tells the Hellions that as they wanted the fight, they are going to get it.</p><p> </p><p>Kevin announces that the cure is still working, so he is powerless, so Julian, who is telekinetically getting Tag out of harms way, asks Kevin to watch over him. Cessily hands Wither the case, telling him to look after it and she and the others will keep Diamondback and Paladin away from him.</p><p> </p><p>‘You’re going down, Purple Man!’ Rockslide boasts, letting one of his fists fly towards Paladin, who responds ‘”Purple Man?” That guy controls minds’, grabbing Santo’s loose hand, he declares that he is more of a straight-forward kind of guy, and asks Santo if he knows Judo, where you use people’s own momentum against them. Santo’s fist is thrown back at him, and smacks him straight in the face.</p><p> </p><p>Cessily has reshaped her body so that she can wind herself around Rachel, pointing out that she is liquid metal, she boasts that there is no way Diamondback can break free. ‘Nice trick’ mutters Rachel, and as she pulls a diamond from her boot, she declares that she has two things Mercury doesn’t - an electric diamond and an insulated costume. Rachel lets the electric diamond explode all around Cessily, setting herself free.</p><p> </p><p>Using his telekinesis to levitate office furniture, Hellion tells Diamondback that she may be able to take some of the Hellions down, but points out that he still has numbers on his side, not to mention raw power. Rachel throws a diamond at him, but it bounces of his psychic shield. Dust surrounds Paladin, warning him that her sands can take flesh from the bone, she declares that they don’t want to hurt anyone. Paladin asks her if she is just stealing the weapon for kicks, the revelation that the case contains a weapon surprises Sooraya.</p><p> </p><p>Rachel dodges a chair which Julian throws at her, informing the Hellions that they are stealing a weapon. ‘And you’re not doing very well either’ adds Paladin as he shoots Sooraya with some sort of stun gun. Hellions tells the mercenaries that they may have distracted Dust with that riff, ‘But I’m not buying it!’ he exclaims, unleashing a raw surge of telekinetic power on them, knocking them both to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>Holding a desk up with his mental powers, Julian hovers over Rachel, telling her that she is the thief, the one who came to steal whatever is in that case. Rachel reveals that she and Paladin were hired by SHIELD - that they are working for the U.S. government. ‘I don’t care!’ Hellion exclaims, before dropping the desk down on Rachel. Wither comes up behind Hellion and reminds him that Diamondback said she was working for the government, but Julian just telekinetically snatches the case from Kevin, muttering that he heard, he suggests that they all leave.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, Hellion creates a telekinetic platform to carry his teammates away on. Santo asks Julian if it is really a weapon, to which Hellion replies that it is high-tech, and that anything can be used as a weapon. Kevin points out that they just took it from SHIELD, to which Hellion asks Kevin if he believes Diamondback. Hellion asks his teammates if Paladin and Diamondback were with SHIELD, where were the agents? Why mercenaries - they must have been stealing it. He asks if they really trust the government any more than the Kingmaker and reminds his friends that they made a deal - ‘Signed and delivered’.</p><p> </p><p>Arriving back at the Kingmaker’s office, Wither asks Julian to wait, but Hellion marches forward, declaring that there is no waiting as they made a deal. ‘Maybe you guys don’t get what that means’. The Kingmaker’s receptionist tells the Hellions that she will let the Kingmaker know they are here, and leaves them in the waiting room. Wither grabs the case from Hellion, who tells him to stop screwing around. Angrily, Julian tells Kevin that he cannot mess this up and suggests they just give the Kingmaker the case.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Santo comes to Wither’s defense and tells Julian to back off, adding that he wants to know what is in the case too. Kevin tries to get it open, but reports that it is locked. Julian tells him to let it stay that way, to which Tag agrees, reminding his teammates that they made a deal and the Kingmaker upheld his end, so they need to uphold theirs. Kevin turns to Cessily, ‘Can you…?’ he asks. Knowing what Kevin wants, Cessily smiles and replies that of course she can, explaining that once she is in she can shape her hand…’There!’ she announces as she uses her liquid metal body to open the case.</p><p> </p><p>‘What is it?’ someone asks as the Hellions stare at a black device and a green tube. ‘A biological weapon,’ reveals the Kingmaker, announcing that the amount in the cylinder is enough to kill every man, woman and child in a city the size of Los Angeles. A furious Dust points at the Kingmaker, declaring that he lied to them, that Genetassist is not his client. The Kingmaker reveals that Dust’s revelation is correct, revealing that his client didn’t want to have to pay Diamondback and Paladin for the weapon and he didn’t want the government to get it.</p><p> </p><p>Rockslide asks the Kingmaker who his client is, to which Hellion asks what it matters, as whoever it is wants a bio-weapon, meaning he has to be bad news. Santo declares that he wants to know, after all, they were used. The Kingmaker exclaims that it doesn’t matter, as this is a client, which means he does things for him, and vice-versa, informing the Hellions that one day his client may help further their own dreams, and right now, they are helping to further his.</p><p> </p><p>‘No!’ declares Wither. The Kingmaker points out that they do not have a choice, as they signed the papers. ‘You work for me. Signed and delivered’. Hellion pauses before making a move, thinking, then he suddenly grabs the case back from Wither. ‘He’s right,’ Julian exclaims, ‘A deal’s a deal,’ he says, handing the case to the Kingmaker. ‘Signed and delivered’.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The kids have made their deal with the devil, and now they want out! Ha, easier said than done, Hellions. They’re not getting out without a fight!</em></p><p>The Californian Desert, just outside the research facilities of Genetassist. Mercenaries Rachel “Diamondback” Leighton and the man known only as Paladin stand and wait for a helicopter to land, and once it does, Colonel Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. emerges from it, asking them if they want to explain to him what has happened here. ‘It’s like we said on the radio, Nicky…there was a group of kids -’ ‘That’s Colonel Fury to you,’ Fury reminds Paladin, before sarcastically remarking that he is glad to see his top-notch mercenaries taken out by a bunch of children.</p><p>Calling Fury “Nicky” again, Paladin points out that they had a first-class telekinetic with them. Fury mutters that he is going to pretend he didn’t hear that, and hands Rachel a photograph, asking her if this is the telekinetic, a kid called Hellion who saved the governor recently. Rachel confirms that it is him. Fury hands her another photo of the other Hellions, explaining that they are a group of students from the Xavier Institute who have been making all sorts of trouble recently. Paladin asks Fury why he doesn’t get off his and Rachel’s case and do something about it. ‘We intend to,’ Fury declares, holding up a security photo of the Hellions surrounded at an airport some time ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the office of the Kingmaker in Beverly Hills, Julian “Hellion” Keller, leader of the Hellions holds the weapon in his hand, and offers it to the Kingmaker as promised. Julian’s teammate Sooraya “Dust” Qadir protests, as does Kevin “Wither” Ford. The Kingmaker reminds the kids that a deal is a deal, they signed the papers, warning them that they do not want to find out the consequences of breaking the deal. He points out that he has upheld his end of the bargain, so now it is their turn.</p><p>Before Julian places the case in the Kingmaker’s hand, he declares that there is one condition - that the contracts be destroyed so they are free from the deal. Julian returns the case to his side, telling the Kingmaker to release them from the deal and they will give him what he wants, so they will have fulfilled their obligation, but after that, they are done. The Kingmaker smiles and asks Julian if that is what he really wants. Julian replies that he doesn’t want to be tied to anyone. The Kingmaker reminds him that once the deal is off, all the benefits they have recently enjoyed will be gone.</p><p>The Kingmaker reminds Kevin that the cure has almost worn off, so he will need to take another dose soon if he wants the death touch to stay dormant. The Kingmaker turns to Sooraya and points out that he could her mother into the United States, and he doubts the Xavier Institute could do the same, even doubting that they could track her down the way he did. The Kingmaker informs Santo “Rockslide” Vaccarro that he will be banned from the wrestling circuit and will never get the chance to prove his strength. The Kingmaker places a hand on one of Cessily Kincaid a.k.a. Mercury’s shoulders, reminding her that her parents finally accept her for who she is, she has their love and didn’t have to change. ’I made that happen. What happens if our deal is off? Are you willing to risk losing that?’</p><p>The Kingmaker reveals that when Brian “Tag” Cruz came to him, his wish was to keep his friends after they got their own wishes. Julian is surprised at Tag’s wish, to which Brian, somewhat embarrassed, claims that he thought will everyone getting everything they ever wanted, the group might stop hanging out, that everyone would leave him and he would have nobody. The Kingmaker angrily reminds Brian that it was he who made him realize he could be the one to make the others happy, he could make them need him, adding that in time, he could have been the next Kingmaker.</p><p>Turning to Hellion, the Kingmaker reminds him of fortune and glory and of how the world treats mutants and the little respect he gets from his own parents. The Kingmaker tells Julian to imagine how the world would treat him if he pulled the plug on his arrangement with Jennifer Matlin and her newspaper. Julian pauses before looking back at his friends. He then turns back to the Kingmaker and tells him to tear up the contracts.</p><p>In another office, the Kingmaker holds the contracts in his hand, telling Julian that this is his last chance. ‘Do it,’ Julian declares, before the Kingmaker tells him to put the case on the desk. The Kingmaker then puts the contracts into a shredder, announcing that the Hellions are now released from the deal. Julian places the weapon on the desk, telling the Kingmaker that the weapon now belongs to him or whichever client he has arranged to give it to.</p><p>The Kingmaker declares that Dr. Octopus will be very pleased, and tells the kids that they are missing out on being part of a very exclusive clientele. He informs the Hellions that they are free to leave and to do whatever they want with the rest of their ‘pathetic and uninspired lives’. Julian smirks, ‘Whatever we like, huh? Well for starters…we’d like to take that case back…NOW!’ Julian leads his team into battle against the Kingmaker, using his telekinesis to throw a chair at the Kingmaker, however the Kingmaker mutters ‘Stupid kids…’ and tapping a button on his watch, a force field appears around him.</p><p>The Kingmaker stands protected, and asks the Hellions if they think that after all these years in doing business, he wouldn’t have made a few deals for himself. He boasts that his client list is long and that some of them have amazing gifts with technology. ‘You kids have no idea who you’re dealing with’. Blasting Rockslide with an optic beam, the Kingmaker congratulates the Hellions on getting him to release them from the contracts, which he thinks is their loss. Sending some sort of charge through Hellion and Dust, he tells them that they do not have the power to stop him.</p><p>Brian tags himself and walks over to the Kingmaker, who tells him that he has got to be kidding, as he has worked with mentalists before and several even work for him. ‘Do you really think your limited form of mind control can affect me?’ The Kingmaker punches Tag in the face, knocking him backwards, before turning to Wither reminding him that he wants his powers to be gone, well now they are and won’t return for another half hour.</p><p>‘Be careful what you wish for, huh?’ However, the Kingmaker jibes Kevin by telling him that he never uses his power anyway, always fighting what he is. He tells him that he could be a magnificent killing machine, but shooting him with an optic blast calls him pathetic as he slams against a wall. The Kingmaker’s assistant, Stephanie, enters the room, and the Kingmaker tells her to call the police, informing them that there are wanted felons in his office and that they have trashed the place. ‘Come to think of it, this place is a dump. We’re breaking out lease’.</p><p>Soon, the Hellions all lie unconscious on the floor as the police arrive. ‘Don’t move!’ shout the police which wakes the Hellions up. Brian tags himself, which causes the police to flee ‘Must run!’ ‘Must run!’ they exclaim, when they arrive back outside, their colleagues are waiting for them, and one of them asks what happened back there, suddenly, one of the police sees Hellion lifting his teammates away on a telekinetic platform, escaping through a large hole in the building.</p><p>Santo tells Julian that he is glad he is so powerful, but Julian doesn’t think so, pointing out that the Kingmaker wiped the floor with all six of them, before asking Kevin if his powers are back online, if the cure has worn off. Kevin replies that he can feel it like a hunger, it is coming back, but swears that he will not use it. Julian points out that if the Kingmaker is getting the weapon to Doctor Octopus, then he is heading for New York, which means they need to go to the airport, adding that at this late at night, it is the only time in Los Angeles when the freeways are empty.</p><p>Indeed the freeways are rather empty, including the one that the Kingmaker is traveling along. Talking on his mobile phone, he informs someone that they shouldn’t worry, as all their roots are pulled up, and when the kids give the authorities any information, there will be no one for the authorities to find. He tells whoever he is speaking to that this hardly even affects them so to stop worrying, and boasts that he is always prepared for these contingencies.</p><p>Suddenly, there is a crunch, and the Kingmaker is thrown out of his seat. He calls to Stephanie and asks her what is going on out there. ‘Can the Kingmaker come out an play?’ asks Rockslide, standing in front of the smashed up car. Holding the case in his hand, the Kingmaker tells the Hellions that their learning curve appears to be non-existent, and reminds them that they cannot touch him or the case. Hellion uses his telekinesis to lift the car up, causing Stephanie to tumble out of it as he points out that for all the Kingmaker’s talk and mystical-looking scrolls, he is jus at man - a man with a nasty rolodex and some toys.</p><p>Tossing the car at the Kingmaker, Julian boasts that he and his friends are much more - ‘We’re mutants!’ the car hit’s the Kingmaker’s force field and goes up in flames. As the Kingmaker reminds the Hellions that he left them alive last time, Santo fires one of his fists at him, though it bounces off of the force field. Julian sees that the Kingmaker is going for his glasses, which means he will have to drop the force field, so now is their chance. Dust offers to handle it, but unleashing an optic blast, the Kingmaker exclaims ‘Lets just finish this already,’ and the power blasts right through Rockslide, causing him to become, literally, a rock slide.</p><p>Julian starts to pick up the pieces of his broken teammate and orders everyone to stick to the plan, and to hold the Kingmaker off while he puts Santo back together before he dies. Julian asks Kevin to give him a hand, as the Kingmaker smirks and reminds the Hellions of what he said about leaning curves, boasting that inside the force field, the kids cannot touch him - except Dust that is, and suddenly in her sand form, she glides past him and knocks his watch off his wrist. ‘Let’s lose those glasses too,’ suggests Cessily as she transforms her hand into a mace, knocking the glasses from the Kingmaker’s face.</p><p>Tag approaches the Kingmaker, who reminds him that his mind control won’t work, to which Brian tells the Kingmaker that he reminded him that it is mind control, and all this time he has made someone “it” and everyone ran. But now he knows that he cam make people “it” for real. ‘I can make you a star’. Brian touches the Kingmaker’s foot, and everyone suddenly wants a piece of him as several passing cars all stop, and people get out of their vehicles, all stating that they must be near to the Kingmaker.</p><p>Brian warns the Kingmaker that the people are going to keep coming until he is buried under a pile of people, and Cessily slams her mace-like fist down, telling the Kingmaker that it is over. The Kingmaker dodges Cessily’s attack, ‘Not yet’ he exclaims, reaching for his watch, and grabbing it, he sticks it to Cessily, who is stopped in her tracks. The Kingmaker reminds Cessily that he only stunned her with it last time, before pointing out that with mercury and electricity, electricity wins every time.</p><p>Holding the unmoving Mercury to the ground, the Kingmaker warns Tag to shut off his power and get the people back, or else Mercury will die. Tag complies as the Kingmaker orders Dust to revert back to her human form and get away from him. ‘Do not kill her’ pleads Sooraya. Wither tells the Kingmaker to let Cessily go and then they will let him go. The Kingmaker smirks as he tells the Hellions that they will let him go, and he will take Cessily with him to ensure that.</p><p>‘No. You’ll let her go now. Or you’re dead,’ declares Wither, holding a de-gloved hand near the Kingmaker’s face. The Kingmaker doesn’t believe that Kevin’s powers are back on yet, but Kevin claims that they are, as he can feel it - it is hungry and wants him to use the power, wants him to kill ‘And you’re giving me plenty of reasons to stop fighting it’. The Kingmaker releases Cessily from his thrall and announces that it is done, when suddenly, ‘No…you’re done!’ exclaims Hellion as he finishes putting Rockslide back together and rushes the Kingmaker, knocking him aside with a powerful telekinetic blast.</p><p>The Kingmaker lies sprawled out on the freeway as he slowly reaches for the case holding the weapon - until Rockslide sets his hands down on the Kingmaker’s arms and then sits down on his back, trapping him as he jokes that he likes it better when he is the one breaking himself into pieces. Julian takes hold of the case, informing his friends that they have got it back. The Kingmaker angrily tells the Hellions to keep the case, just as long as they let him go, adding that he will even restore their wishes. Dust reminds her teammates of how she has always felt throughout this event - it is a deal with the Devil, no matter what he offers them.</p><p>Julian thanks the Kingmaker for the offer, remarking that he would rather send his sorry butt to jail. Kevin takes hold of Cessily and asks her if she is okay. Mercury looks into Wither’s eyes and exclaims that he saved her. However, Cessily frowns when Kevin replies of course he did because she is his friend. Tag hands Wither his glove, telling him that he never realized how hard his power is for him, that it called to him like it does. ‘It is what it is. It is what I am,’ Kevin replies.</p><p>Later, Fury, Diamondback and Paladin arrive at the site of the Hellion’s tussle with the Kingmaker, and Rachel asks Julian if he had a change of heart. Julian replies that he needed to make sure the Kingmaker was a genuine villain then sever his ties, before explaining that in the end, they were on the same side. ‘What can I say? I’m a hero!’ he jokes. ‘Hero, huh? I’ll try to keep that in mind while I recover from the table you dropped on me,’ Rachel replies.</p><p>Fury explains to Paladin that they are going to drop the charges against the Hellions as long as they keep their mouths shut. ‘Who cares about charges? When do I get paid? Paladin asks. ‘You’re a piece of work, Paladin’ Fury mutters as he opens the case, only to discover that the weapon has been damaged. Hellion smirks and tells Diamondback that the computer files in there must have got damaged during the fight.</p><p>Diamondback smiles, before Hellion admits that it might have been his friends’ ability to wither anything organic which made the weapon inert, accidentally of course. Rachel storms off, informing Julian that nobody gets it now, not even the government, so he cost her the finders fee. Hellion points out that he kept a bio-weapon from getting out there, ‘So all in all, I think you know I’m the real deal!’ he exclaims, arms outstretched. Rachel tells Julian that he is cute, and suggests he call her in a few years.</p><p>In the locker room of a wrestling arena, Wither takes down some posters of Rockslide and tells his friend to cheer up, for at least he will go down in wrestling history with a perfect 1-0 record. Santo replies that it stinks, but it was a stupid wish anyway, not like Kevin’s he thinks, and tells Kevin he is sorry he still has his death touch.</p><p>Sooraya sits alone and speaking on the telephone, she informs another person that she is seeking a refugee whose name is Mirah Qadir. Sooraya is surprised when she learns that her mother has been transferred from the camp, and asks the person she is speaking to if they know where to. It seems they don’t and put Sooraya on hold. Dust covers her mouth as the tears begin to fall from her eyes.</p><p>Cessily stands on her parents front lawn, ‘Mind control?’ her father remarks, before declaring that he remembers everything now, that the man in the suit wanted to talk to he and his wife about Cessily and brought these people along with him. Mrs. Kincaid informs Cessily that the men looked into their eyes and then suddenly everything was different. Cessily tells her parents that she just wanted them to accept her. ‘By forcing us to?’ her mother asks. Cessily’s father frowns and asks his daughter what she wanted them to accept - that their daughter isn’t human? That she travels with people who can make them change their minds? Walking back into their house, Mr. Kincaid tells his daughter that it might be best if she stayed at “that school” next time she has a break.</p><p>Mercury turns to Tag who is standing by the road and asks him if it is true, were her parents really being mind-controlled? Brian replies it is, and explains that once they turned the Kingmaker in, he went through his rolodex and found listings for a couple of low-level telepaths. Brian apologizes to Cessily, who exclaims that she should have known there was no way her parents would suddenly accept her, but she was so happy and just didn’t see it. Cessily admits that she was so naive, but Tag reminds her that it is her parents who did something wrong, for she is their daughter and shouldn’t require mind control. Cessily begins to cry and hugs Tag.</p><p>At the Keller Mansion, Jennifer Matlin’s front-page article “Los Angeles’ Mutant Menace” lies on the table as Julian’s stern father tells him that they do not appreciate having to rush back from their vacation to find that Julian has gotten himself into another mess. Julian asks ‘What?’ pointing out that S.H.E.I.L.D. cleared the Hellions of everything and explains that the reporter is just carrying out the Kingmaker’s grudge against them. Julian’s mother tells her son that he shouldn’t have crossed the Kingmaker, for he is a very powerful man and they owe him, so they cannot protect their son from the Kingmaker.</p><p>Julian smiles ‘Protect <em>me</em>? In case you haven’t been checking the scores, me and my friends waled on him!’ Julian warns his parents that if anyone needs protection it is going to be them, for the Kingmaker is going to be ticked off, and he now knows he cannot handle the Hellions. ‘You got in bed with a villain and now he’s gonna be mad at <em>you</em>’. Julian starts to take his leave, suggesting to his parents that they should be looking to him for protection, and telling them that if they need him, to give him a call, for unlike them, he is always there for his family.</p><p>In Los Angeles, at the Federal Building, Stephanie welcomes the Kingmaker back and holds the door open to the car. The Kingmaker asks how many favors they had to burn to get him out of this. Stephanie reveals that they didn’t have to use any favors, to which the Kingmaker asks how it is possible. Stephanie suggests he get inside the car, and upon doing so, inside he sees Emma Frost. ‘It’s been a long time…’ smirks the Kingmaker. ‘…Since I had you tossed from the Hellfire Club? It certainly has,’ declares the White Queen.</p><p>The Kingmaker asks Emma if she got him released, to which Emma replies she did, which means, but the Kingmaker’s rules, he now owes her. Angrily, the Kingmaker begins to say that they didn’t enter a deal, but addressing him as Wallace, Emma tells him to shut up and listen to her, warning him that if she can get him out of prison, she can put him back in - and no amount of favors will get him back out if she exerts a little mental influence.</p><p>The White Queen informs the Kingmaker that her children are to be left alone now and forever. ‘Are we clear?’ Emma gets out of the car and the Kingmaker replies that they will be unharmed. ‘Not just unharmed. You go nowhere near them’ Emma orders. The Kingmaker tells Emma that the Hellions are very impressive, to which Emma replies that she knows.</p><p>Later, at the Xavier Institute, Julian sits in Emma’s office and tells the school headmistress that he realizes they made a scene at the airport, and got into trouble with S.H.E.I.L.D. - and trashed a freeway, but wants to know if it would be okay if the Hellions stayed here instead of going to his parents house. Julian tells Emma that he promises to listen now to her lectures about responsibility. ‘My “lectures”?’ Emma asks, telling Julian that when he is trying to behave he is still so insolent - which is one of the things she likes the most about him.</p><p>‘You truly are a Hellion. You will always do what feels best,’ Emma tells Julian with approval, and exclaiming that after his adventures in California, it is quite clear that his instincts can be trusted and that he will do the right thing. ‘I couldn’t be more proud of you’. Emma leads Julian out of her office, the young mutant asking the White Queen if she isn’t made at him. Emma points out that he and his team were faced with great temptation. Did they falter? Yes. Did they come through? Absolutely.</p><p> </p><p>Emma and Julian walk outside where Dust, Mercury, Tag, Rockslide and Wither are waiting. Emma tells Julian that they are all welcome to stay here, but that means training. ‘I’ll make a hero out of you yet, Julian. Of you…and of all my Hellions!’.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em> <br/>One of Bruce Wayne's oldest friends is found dead in Gotham Bay, ripped apart by a mysterious sea monster. As he investigates the bizarre death, Batman is drawn into a fatal encounter with the murderous creature.</em>    <br/> <br/> <br/>Bruce Wayne hosts the Museums Annual Fundraiser costume party on one of his yachts. He is a little put out due to the fact that Edward Nigma, the Riddler, was invited in order to add to the excitement.<br/></p> <p>One of Bruce's childhood friends, Matthew Atkins, is also attending. Matthew has a tendency to indulge himself too much. He steps out to get some air when it is discovered that he's fallen overboard.<br/></p> <p>Bruce jumps in without anyone seeing him. Sharks have started their attack on Matthew. From a hidden hull in the yacht, Bruce is able to launch a Bat-sub to help deal with the sharks and to bring Matthew on board. Bruce is unable to save Matthew but discovers some sort of shark tooth in his hand.</p> <p>Sensing that there was more to his death, Batman is on the case. Matthew had pretty much spent his entire inheritance yet was still spending money at a great rate. Batman also finds the shark bites on his body peculiar. The tooth he was able to recover was not from a common breed.</p> <p>Batman searches his apartment and is lead to the museum. It seemed that Matthew, with the help of his \"girlfriend\" the museum dirctor, was switching rare archaeological pieces with fakes and selling them on the black market.</p> <p>Hearing a muffled scream, Batman investigates. He finds the Riddler unconscious on the floor and is attacked by a Kiribati warrior. The warrior seemingly begins to get the upper hand when the Riddler awakes. He shoots the warrior in the back with a flaming arrow and Batman is able to tie him up. From the shadows a gun is pointed at them when Batman takes them out too. It turns out to be the museum director.<br/></p> <p>The warrior was the museum's restorer. They, along with Matthew were all in on the scheme to sell the artifacts. When Matthew wanted a bigger cut, they killed him and made it look like an accident.</p> <p>Batman allows the Riddler to take all the credit as he leaves.</p>",

According to a device that recorded the dying Abin Sur's final thoughts, the power ring had located two men worthy of succeeding him as the Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814, but it selected Hal Jordan because he was closer to the crash that killed Sur. Viewing an alternate timeline, Jordan witnessed Gardner prove himself a worthy emerald clad champion and struck up a friendship with him.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>First appearance of Guy Gardner as a Green Lantern.</li><li>Black Hand, Shark, Sonar, Dr. Polaris and Sinestro cameo appearances.</li><li>Reprinted in <em><a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-lantern-184-earth-s-other-green-lantern/4000-25124/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-25124\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Lantern #184</a></em>, <em><a href=\"/green-lantern-in-brightest-day-1-in-brightest-day-/4000-268420/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-268420\">Green Lantern: In Brightest Day #1</a></em>, <em><a href=\"/showcase-presents-green-lantern-3-volume-three/4000-214826/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-214826\">Showcase Presents: Green Lantern #3</a></em> and <em><a href=\"/green-lantern-a-celebration-of-75-years-1-hc/4000-502092/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-502092\">Green Lantern: A Celebration of 75 Years #1 - HC</a></em>.</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>This is the city of New York 30 years later. The future is looking bleaker by the second, and it appears that New York is now an independent state, and although no 'super crime' has happened in over a decade, the government employs fascist methods to combat regular crime by using a new form of police, the merciless \"Reign\".</p><p>An old J. Jonah Jameson is giving out illegal copies of The Daily Bugle, shouting about how \"The Spider\" has returned. A news show the DBN (Daily Bugle News) covers a story of a crazy man (J. Jonah Jameson) who was giving out illegal newspapers and was rushed away by a group of children. </p><p>Two heavily guarded people burst through a closed door talking about an old \"codger\" (Spider-Man/Peter Parker) who took out two armed R.E.I.G.N. officers. Saks (one of the men),the other seems to be the leader of New York, wishes to accelerate the WEBB project, releasing it tonight, and catch Spider-Man. They go down to the Vault. Saks declares that \"With great responsibility comes great... Power\" Once in the Vault they find six people who volunteered to catch Spider-Man. They are called the Sinister Six, and are all fitted with micro-thermal explosives if they turn against their jobs.</p><p>A girl is reading a newspaper and two R.E.I.G.N. officers come up and take it from her, telling her that it's contraband. She insults them and is asked by a boy to join her for a special meeting...</p><p>Back to Peter, getting ready to pack, yelling at his fantasy of Mary-Jane to help and to get ready to leave. He shaves his beard and cuts himself. Peter is stunned to see that the blade cut his face.</p><p>Back to the girl who is going down a dark alley to an abandoned church. She hears the preaching of a man from inside. Going in she sees J. Jonah Jameson with a congregation of children. He orders a boy named Kasey to hack into the DBN network.</p><p>All over New York all mechanical video screens are disrupted and J. Jonah Jameson's announcement comes though, telling of Spider-Man coming to save everyone from oppression.</p><p>People start congregating out in the streets to hear the message and R.E.I.G.N. police come and start to break up the crowds. A man named the Hypno-Hustler comes and makes the R.E.I.G.N. officers dance. unfortunately his batteries die out and he is shot, J. Jonah Jameson makes all of his \"children\" watch the killing. </p><p>Out of his window Peter sees Hypno-Hustler being killed and the other officers launching a missile at his apartment. With the explosion Peter emerges in full Black Spider-Man regalia.</p><p>Attacking the R.E.I.G.N. guards, telling jokes and insulting them as he goes. J. Jonah Jameson makes sure that the hacked network is transmitting the fight to everyone in New York. Jonah is attacked by an officer and rising up the citizens attack the officer.</p><p>Kasey is then impaled by Kraven The Hunter's machete, and Electro and the Sinister Six attack Spider-Man. Peter is severely beaten but is saved by the \"Deus Ex Machina\" Doctor Octopus. Peter is brought to MJ's grave as Doc Ock digs it up. The WEBB project is being activated tonight.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Brief Description:</b></p><p>After the Fury attacked the X-Men at Braddock Manor, Sage is aware that something is wrong. As soon as she makes Storm aware of this, she is attacked, remotely, by the Fury. It uses Cannonball’s cyber shades to interact with Sage’s. Nanites are created in Sage’s shades and they dig their way into her mind, soon gaining partial control of her. The Fury then tries the same trick with Storm, but she manages to get free of them before they sink in too deep. Wolverine, too, experiences another such attack, but survives. They head to Sage’s carriage house, to discover what’s going on, but Sage attacks Nightcrawler and fends off Wolverine. Storm sounds a full security alert, but the Fury, acting through Sage, activates the mansion’s defenses, gassing all but the trio of X-Men with Sage. As laser beams then strafe the area, Wolverine has Nightcrawler teleport them into the tunnels below the estate. In England, Cannonball has survived the Fury’s attack and, in saving Bishop, he thrusts the Fury into a propane tank. To his astonishment, the Fury emerges unscathed through the flames. The three X-Men at the mansion prepare to use unusual tactics to bring Sage down. They play against type when she appears, keeping her off balance. Helping them is Sage herself, using her indomitable will power to defend herself against the Fury’s insidious invasion. She battles Nightcrawler, who manages to keep her at arms length long enough for Storm to attack with an electromagnetic pulse. Sage lashes out at them, but the pulse does the job, crippling the nanites long enough for her to rip the shades from her face in a desperate last ditch attempt to assert her own free will. Nightcrawler, Wolverine and Storm ensure she is all right but, even though Sage is herself again, she is already making plans for the Fury.</p><p><b>Full Synopsis:</b></p><p>(Xavier’s Institute for Higher learning: Sage’s Loft)</p><p>Sage processes date at speeds that put the fastest computer to shame. She forgets nothing. After witnessing Cannonball’s apparent demise at the hands of the Fury, she knows something is seriously wrong, as she looks at the monitors and, again, says Sam’s name, receiving no answer.</p><p>(Underneath Braddock Manor)</p><p>The Fury holds Sam’s cyber shades and studies them. The object is more than it seems. It is part of a global data network. It represents a potential threat, but also an opportunity. Using its own inbuilt circuitry, the Fury carefully carries out an intricate operation on the shades’ own circuits.</p><p>(Xavier’s Institute for Higher Learning)</p><p>Sage asks for a response from Bishop and Rachel, but still receives no response. For all her skills she remains fundamentally human; bound by human limits. She calls Ororo and tells her that they may have a problem. By the time she realizes she is in danger, and all she needs is a fraction of a second, the battle is lost. Prompted by the Fury’s machinations, her own cyber shades begin to act in an organic fashion, shooting tiny wires into her complicated brain. The effect of this invasion is devastating. A burst of energy is released, shattering monitors around her and throwing her from her seat. The Fury will acquire control of the network, by assimilating its host.</p><p>At that moment, above the mansion, Storm and Nightcrawler are still waltzing in the clear night sky. He compliments her on her ability to waltz, but she replies that, in the air, everything’s easy. Her glasses receive Sage’s message and beep her. She grabs them from nowhere and Kurt asks where she could possibly hide them. She smiles and puts on the shades but, as soon as they are in contact with her skin, she is attacked in the same way as was Sage. Electricity fizzles around her, as the wires try to take a hold of her, but, in a final moment of desperation, she tells Kurt to get them away. He teleports himself and Storm away, leaving the cyber shades hanging in mid-air without a host. A belated lightning blast then destroys them.</p><p>The two X-Men land near the end of the jetty on Breakstone Lake and Kurt asks what’s happening. She hurls him away with one arm, before kneeling and pointing at the sky. A fierce electrical current is released harmlessly into the atmosphere, as Kurt covers his eyes from the blinding effect. Water is forced away from her as she momentarily releases an astonishing amount of energy. Spent, she lies on the jetty, as Kurt rushes to her aid. He thanks heaven she is alive and cradles her, but Wolverine appears behind them, carrying a beer, and informs him that she got lucky. He tosses his own pair of broken shades to the jetty. “I think we all did,” he continues. “If you got a pair of Sage’s special shades, bub, ditch ‘em now.” His own eyes reveal that his healing factor has yet to repair the damage done by his own shades.</p><p>Wasting little time, Kurt teleports into Sage’s carriage house. She sounded the alarm, just before both Ororo and Logan were attacked by their shades. He guesses this is where to look for trouble. Seeing her chair empty, he calls out for her but receives only a deft kick in the arch of his back for his trouble. Wolverine crashes through the skylight above with Storm close behind him. His claws are at the ready. “I’ll take her,” he warns, but Sage is too quick to be taken by surprise. She uses Wolverine’s momentum and uses her cane to divert him to the floor. Logan crashes face first into the shards of glass and other assorted debris which came from the Fury’s initial attack on Sage. Storm calls Cyclops and tells him that they have a combat situation at the carriage house, adding that Kurt and Logan are already down. She sounds a full team security alert as she looks at Sage. Under her hood, she notices that her cyber shades have somehow rearranged themselves into a strange pattern.</p><p>Cyclops is having dinner with Emma Frost and rises from the table. Emma thinks it’s tiresome. She reminds Scott that Storm’s a big girl. Her precious X.S.E is officially sanctioned and everything. She even has a badge, she adds, sarcastically. Surely, she can save the world all by herself? Scott has little time for Emma’s games, and replies to Storm that they’re on their way.</p><p>Now in control of Sage’s actions, the Fury views Ororo. Its tactical scans targets multiple potential hostile contacts in the immediate vicinity. It initiates appropriate counter measures. The mansion’s intruder systems become active, and gas quickly spreads through the buildings. Emma and Scott collapse onto their dining table, while Dani Moonstar and her students drop like flies. Hank McCoy slumps into unconsciousness and Rogue, along with a group of young students, all submit to the rapid effects of the gas. This takes out all the other residents and potential threats to Sage.</p><p>Ororo crackles with electrical energy as she tells Sage to give up, warning her that she won’t get close enough to do her any harm. Wolverine pre-empts the mansion’s defensive actions and leaps onto Ororo, as a host of laser beams begin strafing the room, leaving Sage safe. He takes the brunt of the pain, figuring his healing factor will repair any damage soon enough. He tells Kurt that it’s time to bail. “Make us like Morlocks,” he cries. Kurt teleports to their side and the trio vanish, just as Sage swings her club at them.</p><p>Sage’s rearranged face is impassive as the Fury reassesses the situation. It increases its hold over Sage. Her enzymes flow and her protein strands weave fresh patterns, which place the Fury more in sync with its host. Its targets will be found and eliminated.</p><p>(Underneath Braddock Manor)</p><p>Cannonball, thankfully, isn’t finished just yet. He strains to sit up, as he sees the Fury holding the unconscious Bishop before it. Sam’s leg is broken, despite his blast field being activated during the fight. That’s not supposed to happen. He sees the Fury pointing its left arm towards Bishop’s face, about to perform a swift operation to have him placed under its control, but Cannonball isn’t about to let that happen. Despite the awful pain in his leg, he blasts and collects the Fury in his hands, arcing upwards and out through the manor grounds and high into the air.</p><p>He ignores the pain as he realizes that the creature is already adapting to his attack. Tendrils drift out of its body towards him, and Sam knows he must act immediately. Below, he notices a large propane tank and descends at high speed straight towards it. Without blinking, he smashes straight into it, taking the Fury with him. A massive explosion destroys much of the surrounding area, the force of the blast spiralling Sam out of control. He lands and reckons that, even if it survived, it will be in pretty bad shape. Unfortunately, the Fury simply strides from the flames, seemingly intact and none the worse for the experience.</p><p>(Meanwhile, elsewhere)</p><p>Marvel Girl is unconscious and in flames. The creature had hit her with such force, she was sent high into the air where she passed out. Now, the only way is down, and she plummets towards a large body of water, hitting the surface hard like a bomb.</p><p>(Xavier’s Institute for Higher Learning)</p><p>Back at the mansion, Storm creates a localised rainfall above Wolverine, dousing his back to lessen the pain the lasers caused. Kurt notes that Sage is stronger than she looks. Ororo says she’s full of surprises. They have to assume that whatever controls her has access to them all. She asks Logan why he had Kurt teleport them there. He turns to her, and replies, “Tactics, darling. Define the ground, you command the battle. Against Sage we’ll need every asset we can find.”</p><p>Storm surmises that the glasses are the key. Something in them tried to take her over. With Sage, they must have been completed. Her winds have flushed the intruder gas from this section, but the rest of the institute is still compromised. She wonders what other defenses Sage has activated. Everyone is at her mercy and they cannot abandon them. They have to make their stand here, and they have to win. “Assuming she comes after us,” adds Kurt. Logan reckons she has to. They are the active threat and they have way too much power to ignore. But, Kurt points out, in this confined area, their tactics are limited. Logan admits that was a mistake in his part. Must be getting’ old.</p><p>Kurt points out that Sage knows their powers, their capabilities and, more importantly, their weaknesses. She knows how they think. Wolverine says that’s what he’s counting on, ‘cause it gives them the chance to blindside her. First, though, he pops a middle claw and looks at Ororo’s dress. He tells her there’s no way an evening gown is designed for a running fight. He slashes the dress, and rips it from her body. Ororo is horrified. She and Kurt are, of course, still using their solid light image-inducers, and the evening gown Wolverine holds is simply her own skirt. Wolverine reacts without smiling. He has more important things to worry about now. He has Sage’s scent.</p><p>The tunnel network beneath the estate is vast. Finding her targets is a relatively simple matter. Reaching them takes time. Sage doesn’t make it easy for the Fury. As she walks through the tunnels, weapons in both hands, she is fighting the creature all the way. It has never encountered a consciousness of such wily complexity. The harder it tries to solidify control of her, the more tenaciously and inventively she resists. She stops, drops the weapons and reaches for her face. The Fury remotely rebalances her brain chemistry to make her more pliable. She struggles yet more as the Fury builds alternate neural nets, and reformats the acetylcholine levels of her somatic and parasympathetic nervous system. This makes her comply with the Fury’s wishes, and she picks up the weapons.</p><p>Sage is as methodical as she is relentless, but the Fury will do whatever is required to fulfil its prime directive. As Sage approaches the three X-Men, Storm uses a lightning flash to disorientate her. The Fury sees Storm through its host’s new eyes and notes that Ororo has the ability to generate a huge electrical field. It knows that a lightning strike will probably prove fatal to Sage, but that’s not a significant problem. The same energy Storm manipulates, also mark her as a target. Sage removes a small device from her belt and aims it at Storm. It fires a succession of darts towards her, and Storm’s energy fades.</p><p>Nightcrawler then attacks her himself. He emerges from an access tunnel and tells Sage that Ororo was her friend. She saved her life and she cut Ororo to pieces. Sage fires at him but his agility removes him from her line of fire in an instant. She continues firing as he scampers around the walls, talking all the time as he runs. He leaps and crouches, each time avoiding her attack. He appears to be trying to distract her. He tells her that the Sage he remembers worked for the Hellfire Club. She was the willing partner of one of their most formidable adversaries. As far as he is concerned, she is just reverting to type. A cartwheel knocks the gun from her grasp, and she looks back at Kurt, now holding them in his own hands.</p><p>Sage lunges for the weapons, but Kurt tosses them away before deflecting a kick from her spiked high-heeled boots. “I love what you’ve done to your face, Sage. A ‘gift’ from your puppet master?” he asks, not expecting or receiving a reply. He acrobatically avoids another kick, asking if it’s anyone they know, or someone brand new. Sage loses her balance, as Kurt swipes her leg away with his prehensile tail, but she quickly grabs the tail and drags Kurt from the wall and tries to knock him out with her fists. Again, he avoids her blows, but knows he must be careful. Despite his agility and speed, one careless move and he’s going down.</p><p>Above them, watching the action from a ventilation duct, Storm knows that, although Sage isn’t at her best, she is still dangerous. They can’t afford a single mistake and must play against type. This is why Kurt is fighting without teleporting, and she is hiding in a small space; somewhere a claustrophobe would never choose. She tells herself not to be afraid. She has room. She can breathe. She can survive this.</p><p>Below her, Sage manages to catch Kurt with another swinging kick but, with her concentration on Nightcrawler, Wolverine is able to get behind her, and he places his two outer claws at either side of Sage’s neck. He tells Ororo to nail her with her E.M.P. If it doesn’t work, he’ll pop the middle claw. He means it. The Fury watches everything and, as Storm gets within range and zaps Sage, her opponent reacts with amazing swiftness, taking out both Storm and Wolverine in one graceful move. Fools, thinks the Fury. Do they know nothing? Against some adversaries, they dare not show the slightest mercy. Sage catches Nightcrawler again, as she grabs Storm by the hair and prepares to finish her off.</p><p>“No!” screams Sage, “I - will not - do this.” Her indomitable will reasserts itself at the crucial moment and she stops herself. Storm’s E.M.P has crippled the cyborg nanites infecting her, and the cyber shades from which they were created. “I will be no one’s slave,” she cries, as she tears away at the shades. She can feel them adapting, and has only a moment to act. Charles Xavier taught her that the mind is of the body, the body of the mind. Properly focused, her capabilities are extraordinary, and he still considers her very much a work in progress. She crouches down and desperately rips the shades from her face.</p><p>Suddenly, there is quiet. For now, Sage is grateful for what she learned. Her colleagues approach her gingerly, making sure she is all right. She assures them that she is herself again. She explains that, by focused application of her will, she treated the cyborg elements like any biological virus, and purged them. As for the creature responsible, she continues, it calls itself the Fury. “It doesn’t know the meaning of the word.”</p>",

En route, they pick up Rachel, who emerges from the Irish Sea, a little light headed. She discovers Jean Grey had created a holempathic crystal, which reassures her about her purpose in life. Wolverine backs Jean up, telling Rachel she deserves this fresh start. Back in England, Bishop rejoins the battle and blasts the Fury, but it grabs Sam before he can escape. Bishop explodes a liquid nitrogen canister above them, though Sam’s blast field protects him. With the Fury frozen, the others arrive and Storm uses her powers to ionize the air around it, effectively rendering its scanners useless. Sage grabs the Fury’s core processor and Storm uses the Blackbird to fire three cluster bombs at the Fury, which tear it to pieces. Sage knows it is vulnerable, but will soon adapt. Her plan is to have Kurt place a module inside the Fury, which Rachel can telekinetically lock onto. Wolverine and Nightcrawler manage to place the module within the Fury and Rachel goes to work. She locks onto the module and, despite the enormous effort it takes, creates a controlled breach of the dimensional interface, with the help of her teammates, into which the Fury is banished. With the threat over with, for the time being, the X-Men look forward to their next challenge.</p><p><b>Full Synopsis:</b></p><p>(Braddock Manor, England)</p><p>Having emerged intact from a propane gas explosion, the Fury proceeds to give Cannonball a good going over. It tries focused plasma beams, meson cutters, sonic-pulse cannons and rounds of depleted neutronium. It also utilizes its raw strength, speed and what passes in its matrix for guile. Yet, Cannonball survives. As the Fury adapts to its target, the target, though wounded, adapts as well. If the Fury had the capability for emotion, it would find this annoying. Instead, it increases its capabilities. Even mutant physiology has limits, whilst the Fury does not. The target may be smarter but, in the end it will perish; like all before him.</p><p>(The Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, Westchester, a few minutes earlier)</p><p>The Blackbird takes off, carrying four X-Men on board. Storm pilots the craft, flanked by Wolverine, Sage and Nightcrawler. At their current trajectory and acceleration, they expect to reach England in a matter of minutes. They dare not attempt contact with their colleagues in England in case the Fury infiltrates their network again. Logan thought Sage’s net was secure but, apparently, even she has her limits.</p><p>Nightcrawler mentions that the interdiction gas released during their battle with Sage will keep everyone at the mansion unconscious for hours. They’re on their own. Logan asks what if things go wrong, but Kurt replies that he left Scott and Emma a note. Storm asks Sage if any of her systems can be trusted. Only her brain, she replies. She is about to inform Storm of information she gleaned from the Fury while they were in sync, but she suddenly notices a tremendous surge of energy beneath the Irish Sea. The signature is unmistakably that of Marvel Girl.</p><p>Rachel Grey emerges from the sea feeling fine, but immediately feels faint and begins to fall again. Nightcrawler teleports from the Blackbird and catches her. Safely inside the craft, Sage asks her to catch a few breaths, as her mediscanner reads her as being more dead than alive right now. Rachel can’t remember being hit so hard. Among the X-Men, it’s so easy to take survival for granted. Wolverine’s healing factor could make him virtually immortal. She herself has cheated death many times, bouncing between dimensions, from one end of time to the other.</p><p>She towels herself off and looks at a holempathic crystal attached to her necklace. As she thinks about when Emma said she shouldn’t have been born, Jean Grey’s voice replies from the crystal. “Emma’s a cow.” The image of Jean appears. “Mom?” exclaims Rachel. Jean tells her that this holempathic imprint is the essence of all that she is. No matter what happens to her body, her soul will always be with her.</p><p>She smiles and tells Rachel that how she got here isn’t important. “What matters, daughter, is that you exist.” She thanks Rachel for taking her old codename. The uniform Rachel now wears is one Jean never got to wear while she was Marvel Girl. It makes her proud that Rachel has claimed them both. A tear trickles down Rachel’s cheek and Wolverine’s voice surprises her. He leans on the back of the seat and tells her that her mom looks good. He explains that Jean made the crystal before she died, almost as if she knew what was coming. Not just her fate, but Rachel’s, too. She should cherish the moment, and all that comes with it.</p><p>Rachel replies that this isn’t the uniform she would have chosen for herself. Wolverine thinks maybe that’s why she left it. He says the rest of them on the team are pretty much hardcases, ‘cept maybe for Nightcrawler. “Not me?” asks Rachel. “Girl, not even close,” Wolverine replies. He says that whatever her origin, here and now she gets to start fresh, to be the girl and live the life that shoulda been hers first time round; to truly enjoy the miracle that any of them exist at all. They hug each other, but need to get to work.</p><p>Storm informs them that they’re approaching Braddock Manor and puts the ship in stealth mode. Logan is eager for action, asking for a target, but Sage warns him that the Fury will catch him as soon as he lands in a monofilament spider web. Before he can escape it, the Fury will fillet the flesh from his bones, faster and more expertly than an angler guts his fish. She adds that he probably won’t die, though he’ll wish he could. More importantly, he’ll be useless to them. Rachel asks if she has a better idea. With a raised eyebrow, Sage replies that she has, absolutely.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cannonball continues to try and evade this killing machine. He’s running outta room and tactics, and the Fury tears its way towards him without mercy. The Fury has him cold but Sam knows better, and out of nowhere comes a blast of energy that topples the Fury. Bishop appears carrying a large tank of liquid nitrogen. Looks like the Fury forgot about him.</p><p>Bishop warns Sam to get clear but, as he turns, the Fury swiftly grabs Sam around the neck. Bishop is surprised at its speed. Sam tells Bishop not to worry about him, and to just make his play. Trusting Sam, Bishop hurls the container towards them and destroys it when it reaches them. Although fire doesn’t do much good against the creature, he wonders how it’ll fare against liquid nitrogen. His only concern is whether Sam’s protective field can protect him from being frozen to near absolute zero.</p><p>The nitrogen pours over them both, and Sam’s blast field does indeed protect him. The Fury’s arm snaps off, brittle from the effects of extreme cold. Immediately, Sam notices condensation building; a sign that it is melting already. Bishop wants him outta there but, suddenly, they are joined by Nightcrawler, who teleports both himself and Sage to the scene. Bishop notices lightning overhead and figures it is Storm’s doing. He thought she had better aim but Sage explains that her goal is not to strike the creature, but to ionize the air around it. The ice and fog surrounding it will occlude its optical scanners, while the electrical storm will neutralize its more esoteric sensor array. This will significantly degrade the function of its internal operating system.</p><p>The Fury appears helpless, for now. Sage says it is a window of opportunity and removes her jacket. Bishop can’t believe she’s going in unarmed against it, and says that at least he should go with her. Sage declines his request and strides towards their foe, telling him he might be detected.</p><p>Sage stands before the Fury. For all its power, she thinks, it really is quite stupid. It cannot invent strategy; merely following its programming. It responds to perceived threats. The Fury, blinded by the recent attack, doesn’t perceive Sage as being a threat, and allows her closer. It isn’t until its optical scanners finally recognize her that it begins to react. Too late. Sage ducks under its arm and punches her fist inside the Fury’s organic body. She grabs a small piece of machinery and retreats, as the Fury tries to react.</p><p>Sage is physically thrown away and Nightcrawler teleports to catch her before she lands. He teleports her back to Bishop and Cannonball, and warns them to take cover. Sam wonders what’s happening, as he sees the Blackbird flying overhead. Inside the cockpit, Logan informs Storm that missiles are locked, and Storm fires. Three missiles stream towards the Fury and a massive explosion envelops the creature in a white hot ball of flame.</p><p>Sam says that they tried explosives already and they don’t work. Kurt replies that these are hardly explosives. They are cluster munitions; a big bomb made up of lots of little bombs. Each bomblet, he explains, is a pulse generator producing flat planes of energy that sever the lines of force binding matter together; instant disintegration down to the subatomic level. Whatever they cut essentially ceases to exist. The Fury reels from each impact and, slowly but surely, its body begins to unravel, particle by particle, until it lies in a heap on the ground.</p><p>“My god!” exclaims Bishop, “Where’d that come from?” Kurt tells him that Sage found them in the X-Men arsenal. Bishop apologizes, but thinks that it can’t be this easy. Sage shows them the device she removed from the Fury. It is the core processing unit, and she stamps on it, shattering it beyond repair. The Blackbird hovers above them and Rachel telekinetically lowers herself and Wolverine to join the rest of the team. Sage informs Bishop that, as she speaks, the Fury is growing a new processor. For the first time, though, it is vulnerable.</p><p>In the smouldering pile of remains, tendrils begin to swirl and rebuild. Wolverine is wearing a strange contraption consisting of straps attached to a circular device pulled against his chest. He tells Kurt it may look silly, but he needs to strap himself in - no way does he look this silly solo. Kurt tells him he thinks it’s cute, but Logan replies that he thinks too flamin’ much.</p><p>They are strapped together, facing opposite directions. Rachel passes Kurt a small golden module and Logan asks Bishop how his aim is. Rachel informs Bishop that he’ll have a split second to find the target perfectly and pull them clear, or they’ll be dead. Bishops asks why they can’t have Kurt teleport. Sage reminds him that they’ve used it before and will use it going in. The Fury will note the event and prepare counter measures. Bishop promises he won’t let them down.</p><p>Logan pops his claws and Nightcrawler teleports them next to the reforming Fury. It’s grown faster than Kurt anticipated and he can’t reach its main mass. Logan begins cutting, hacking off tendrils and other body parts to get close to the creature. Logan shouts to Bishop to throw the tether, and it connects with Logan’s chest plate, just as Kurt places the glowing module inside the Fury’s mass. Its reaction is to try and expel the foreign body. Bishop yanks Logan and Kurt away from the creature, as Rachel takes over.</p><p>She reaches out with the power of her mind and uses her ability to manipulate matter with the force of thought. She concentrates hard. To her, the substance of the Fury is quicksilver. Her telekinesis can’t make contact, but the box serves as an anchor point. She takes hold of it and begins to squeeze, compressing its molecular structure until it forms a micro-singularity. The strain begins to show on Rachel, as she effectively builds her own black hole. This creates a gravity well of such unimaginable and irresistible force that even light cannot escape.</p><p>The Fury attempts to defend itself against such a barrage of power, but struggles. At the same time, all physical realities in the immediate vicinity to it are warped beyond recognition. Both space and time lose coherence. The X-Men look on and feel that they’re winning; the Fury’s breaking up. The Fury is in a race with its own annihilation. It creates localized tachyon shunts to bleed off the cosmic suction. It weaves polymer whips to shatter the containment vessel that causes this chaos, and increases its overall density beyond the point where it can be affected by the singularity. In a word; it’s adapting.</p><p>Rachel concentrates harder than ever, but feels she doesn’t have the strength. In a tried and tested manner, the other X-Men move towards her. Sage grabs her shoulders and Bishop, in turn, grabs Sage’s. She assures Rachel that they are a team; they can help. Storm holds on to Sage’s arm and Wolverine touches Rachel’s back. Storm uses lightning to create energy which Bishop amplifies. Sage channels the results into Rachel, who draws on Wolverine’s healing factor to keep herself alive in the process. Kurt and Sam watch from afar, impressed but anxious. This made a lot more sense when Sage explained it. The harder they press, the harder the Fury appears to resist. Considering the primal forces they’re playing with here, Kurt points out, what good is defeating the monster if they also destroy the world?</p><p>A huge vortex surrounds the Fury, but cannonball sees it struggling ever harder. It is regaining its form and Sam thinks it doesn’t look like they’re ‘defeating’ anything. The creature grows to more than ten meters tall, and Rachel begins to doubt herself. She can’t do this, she thinks. Astonishingly, Jamie Braddock, Psylocke and Captain Britain’s crazy brother, appears in the midst of the vortex. “’Course you can, scrumptious, ‘course you can,” he tells her. “It all depends on you.”</p><p>Sage reminds her to concentrate. She can’t lose control of the singularity. Rachel focuses once again and continues to pour on the power. The Fury, immense by now, marks its targets. It has faced them all before and overcome their best efforts. Why is this time different?</p><p>Rachel senses its confusion and thinks it doesn’t understand that their combined efforts are creating synergy. Their combined force transcends their individual efforts. Rachel keeps piling on the mass but keeps the matrix balanced. She struggles to contain the material within the vortex. She wants to create a controlled breach of the dimensional interface, to purge the Fury into a sidebar continuum all its own. She slowly shrinks the size of the singularity, as she increases its mass by quantum levels. Doing this, she creates the ultimate gravity field, a prison that even the Fury cannot escape.</p><p>Suddenly, the Fury is gone. Rachel passes out and the darkness welcomes her after the strain of the past few minutes. She awakens to Nightcrawler’s tender touch. She aches, but Kurt says they all ache, but that certainly beats the alternative. She realizes everyone’s okay and hugs Kurt, who says that thanks to Marvel Girl, they won! The whole team stare at the crystallized crater, which is all that exists of their battle with the Fury. Much of Braddock Manor is in ruins and Logan reckons Brian won’t be happy about what they’ve done to his ancestral home.</p><p>With all the excitement over, Sam needs hospital treatment. Logan congratulates Rachel, saying she did good. Kurt adds that they all did. He tells them that he knows that they had a few rough edges when they came together as a team, but they should savor the moment as they don’t come often. When they do, they make him glad to be an X-Man.</p>",

Spider-Man and the Vulture are bringing a whole new meaning to the term \"Battle of the Books\" as they duke it out in a bookstore! And stuck right in the middle, dodging hardcovers, is poor Deborah Whitman, author of a memoir detailing her tumultuous relationship with Peter Parker. Whoever invented that old saying about words not hurting as much as sticks and stones obviously hasn't lived a day in the webslinger's boots!</p><p>As a younger man, Adrian Toombes cared for his brother Marcus, after a motorcycle accident left him a quadriplegic.  But Marcus, unable to accept his new life, asked Adrian to kill him.  Marcus tells Adrian that, in the wild, he would be food for the lions and vultures, because that’s natures way.  Adrian, unable to kill Marcus, is told to stop being weak, be an animal.</p><p>The Vulture waits near the book signing for Spider-man, aware of his spider-sense, he knows he must be patient and use Spider-man’s compassion against him.</p><p>Before the signing commences, Deb Whitman prepares to be interviewed by a reporter from the Daily Bugle.  She is surprised to find it is Betty Brant.  Betty wants look in the eyes of the kind of woman who would betray a man like Peter Parker.  Deb asks why Betty isn’t outraged by what Peter did to them both.  Betty explains that her life makes more sense now, that Peter Parker isn’t a disguise that Spider-man hides behind, Peter is a caring man, what Peter did he did out of love, compassion and decency, what is Deb’s excuse?</p><p>Peter, in his new disguise, waits in line to ask Deb a few questions when Flash Thompson pushes in to confront her.  Betty pulls Flash aside and is delighted to see him and annoyed that he doesn’t remember dating her.  Peter is finding the proceedings amusing until his spider-sense goes off. </p><p>The Vulture crashes through the window, Flash punches him and he swats Flash aside. He heads for Deb, intending to take her hostage, when Betty shoots him.  The Vulture snaps around and destroys Betty’s gun.  Just as he is about do likewise to Betty, he gets an eyeful of webbing and is thrown into a pillar.  Spider-man says “HI” to Deb as the Vulture flies outside.  Spider-man and the Vulture battle over the city until Spider-man is cut by the Vultures wings, then he starts to become dizzy and lose consciousness.  The Vulture gloats as Spider-man plummets towards the streets below.</p><p>But his triumph is short-lived as his left arm goes numb and he too looses consciousness and drops from the sky.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em><strong>Overview</strong></em></p><p>Continuing the success of the 2004-2005 Official Handbooks of the Marvel Universe, 2006 will feature the return of the Handbook from A to Z! While the Handbooks of the past two years focused on specific themes, this twelve-issue monthly series will extend the coverage to all Marvel’s characters, teams, objects, events, and places–plus past, future and alternate Earths. The spotlight will fall on more than 600 profiles–including new characters, characters who never received a profile and those needing major updates. As an added bonus, there will be special themed Handbooks covering more than 250 characters throughout the year.</p>",

While the Handbooks of the past two years focused on specific themes, this twelve-issue monthly series will extend the coverage to all Marvel's characters, teams, objects, events, and places – plus past, future and alternate Earths. The spotlight will fall on more than 600 profiles –including new characters, characters who never received a profile and those needing major updates.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>\"Innocence Lost,\" part 1 of 6. Spinning out of NYX, Billy Tan and the character's creator Craig Kyle kick off a new series starring X-23. Now it can be told. The full story behind the origin of X-23 -- who she is, where she came from, and the exact nature of her relationship to Wolverine. You think you know, but you have no idea.</em></p><h3>Spoilers</h3><p>The covert Weapon X project created her to be the ultimate killing machine. Armed with an accelerated healing factor and razor-sharp claws, X-23 is an unstoppable assassin. Her mind molded to kill on command, she seems to be a stunning success for the Weapon X scientists. But her genetics hold a dark secret - for within her DNA, there lies a link to the X-Men's Wolverine. Will this mysterious connection to the famed mutant hero prove enough to unshackle X-23 from her blood-soaked origins?</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>They finally did it. Kicked them to the curb. The 'capes and tights' crowd -- there's no place for them in the Big Apple anymore. Peter Parker? He can't even remember what it was like to don the red and blue and swing through the night sky. Doesn't want to, anyway. After all, there's nothing left to fight for, is there? That is until an old 'friend' appears on Peter's doorstep, bearing a package and a message -- and everything changes. If it's not Peter's responsibility, then whose is it?</p><p>This is the city of New York 30 years later. The future is looking bleaker by the second, and it appears that New York is now an independent state, and although no 'super crime' has happened in over a decade, the government employs fascist methods to combat regular crime by using a  new form of police, the merciless \"Reign\".</p><p>We see an old Peter Parker, somewhere over fifty, who is standing in a flower shop, getting yelled at by a couple whom he had given the wrong flowers. They demand their money and back and after, the shop keeper fires Peter. He takes a bouquet of flowers when he gets fired and walk out without paying. The shop keeper yells as Peter walks out \"That's coming out of your paycheck!\" while Peter doesn't care, he is fired.</p><p>The flowers are for Mary Jane, or rather her grave. But he never makes it to the graveyard as he is knocked over by a R.E.I.G.N. officer who was chasing two teenagers for drawing graffiti on a wall. The flowers are then stepped on by another R.E.I.G.N. officer, as Peter is lying in the mud, the officers laugh at him as he is weak, calling him \"Just another old man.\"</p><p>A news broadcast comes onto the television, with them showing the new W.E.B.B. system that will not let anyone into New York and anyone to get out of New York. It's the new plan of the mayor to keep the city safe from any criminals. There haven't been any superhuman activity in the city for over thirty years.</p><p>Peter is inside his house, eating a meal, when suddenly he yells out at something that isn't there. It is obvious that the image of Mary Jane still haunts him, as he still sees her and speaks with her, but she never responds. </p><p>On the street a very old man walks with a walker, yelling at the R.E.I.G.N. officers, calling them rejects and such.</p><p>Peter is sleeping, seeing a dream of MJ kissing him on the bed, and wakes up, finding himself alone again. A bell rings and the old man with the walker shows up at his doorstep. The old man is J. Jonah Jameson. He starts talking with Peter on friendly terms, blabbering about the old newspaper staff. The Daily Bugle no longer exists, so he is out of work. He says he is very sorry for everything that he did to Peter's alter ego, but Peter closes his front door on him. JJ manages to leave a package though, and tells Peter to open it, while walking outside. Peter opens it, finding his old camera he use to work with for the Daily Bugle. </p><p>Outside, JJ is wrecking someone's car with his walker, causing a small bit of chaos so a few R.E.I.G.N. officers ask him to go away. He responds by yelling at them to stand up and fight, knocking one officer in the face with his walker. He gets up and along with his partner, they start beating the old JJ.</p><p>Peter is looking at his camera and finds that the fabric on it, is something that scares him. He drops the camera, then he hears screams from outside of JJ getting beat up.</p><p>He appears before the officers, with his old Black Spider-Man mask, JJ's gift to him along with the camera. Peter jumps in and the officers try to take him down, calling him a little boy. Peter says that the mask thinks it's funny and its laughing. He takes the officers down with his old style and grace of Spider-Man, along with the trademark Spider humor. He kills one of the officers leaving the other to flee.</p><p>After taking down the officers, JJ tells him that he needs Spider-Man to help him save the city. He asks Peter to put their past behind them and that they need each other's help. Peter doesn't say anything, but punches JJ in the face, knocking him out. Then he walks away.</p>",
