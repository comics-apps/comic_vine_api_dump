When his fear of flight is revealed to his peers at ps238, the result is sympathy, mockery, and... a dastardly plot?</em></p><p>Remember being self-conscious about possibly screwing something up when you were in grade school? Now imagine that and multiply it by the factor of having super-powers. That's what's been going through Captain Clarinet's head every night thanks to a recurring dream that he's going to accidentally fly into the path of an oncoming plane, and now he's afraid to fly. But when Ron loses his cape due to a classmate's prank, he has to fly to get it down from the flagpole and suddenly his worst fears are realized!</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>PS238 #2 PS238 is designed to handle visitors from all walks of life... on this planet. When a small spacecraft crashes into the playground bearing an alien child, the faculty and staff find that otherworldly beings can often present their own problems to education. And why was he sent to our world in the first place?</em></p><p>It looked like it was going to be yet another boring night of repairs and sensor tweaking for Herschel Clay, when his work was suddenly interrupted by an unidentified object crashing to earth right behind him! This UFO turned out the transport of a small, green-skinned, armor-clad alien, who, much to Herschel's chagrin, didn't speak a word of English. The alien was friendly, and even displayed a sense of humor, shooting Herschel with what amounted to an interstellar ping-pong ball gun. Herschel takes the alien and his ship into custody inside PS238 so as to avoid their discovery by the world at large. Day breaks and we find Cristina Kyle arriving at Excelsior Public School to find a military presence there and a staff meeting shceduled by the \"above-ground\" principal on her itinerary, thanks to the military's investigation of the UFO. Cristina finds out that the staff of PS238 is already handling it from their end, with Herschel, Doctor Positron, Doctor Newby, and Principal Cranston placating their military liaison. The staff of PS238 talk the colonel into letting the alien and his ship stay at PS238, promising to keep the military apprised of any new developments. The alien is introduced to the student body, who immediately come of with multiple potential names for him. While further investigating the alien's ship, Herschel and Dr. Positron accidentally activate the ship's transformation circuits, causing it to morph into a hostile, quasi-sentient robot, which immediately begins tearing up the school. This forces Herschel to set off the emergency alarm in PS238, which also trips the fire alarm in the school above, saving Cristina, Vashti, and the rest of the school staff from yet another staff meeting. The robot's rampage causes it to demolish the wall between Herschel's lab and the gym, interrupting coach Rockslide's phys ed class. The robot drives Rockslide into the ground like a fencepost and the students rush to his aid. As the students attempt to hold the robot back, Dr. Newby brings the alien to the gym to try to get his technology under control. The robot resists the alien's commands and attacks, forcing the alien to blow up his ship using a self-destruct mechanism, effectively leaving the alien stranded. Following this ruckus the staff of PS238 meet to decide what to do with their alien visitor. Deciding to call him Prospero, after another stranded person with great power, they opt to let him stay at PS238. Our story ends with Herschel finding Prospero on the roof of Excelsior Public School at night, looking up to the stars. Herschel listens to Propsero deliver a soliloquy that he can't understand, wherein Prospero seems to be saying something about the stars. Herschel tells Prospero they have a room made up for him and gives him a blanket to use if he's going to be up on the roof for any length of time. As Herschel leaves the roof, Prospero once again shoots him with the ping-pong ball gun, which the staff has come to recognize as an act of affection.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>PS238 #3 Ps238 is a special learning institution for kids that can leap tall buildings, bend titanium with their minds, or teleport halfway around the world... so why is Tyler there? Meet a kid whose parents are among the Earth's most powerful beings, yet to all testing available, seems bereft of any kind of superhuman trait.</em></p><p>Our story opens with Tyler being sent from a classroom at Excelsior Public School to his regular classroom and teacher, Ms Kyle. Instead of going just a couple doors down to Ms Kyle's classroom, Tyler steps into a locker and rides it down into PS238, to the actual location of Cristina Kyle's class, where Miss Kyle is showing the class Prospero's new hologram disguise. Miss Kyle introduces Tyler Marlocke to the class, where he is immediately asked about his super powers. Miss Kyle pulls up his file to find him listed as \"Metabilities Pending\" - he has no powers. While she is reviewing Tyler's file she is interrupted by Victor Von Fogg, another new student in her class, who she initially mistakes for Zodon due to Victor's similar demeanor. She has Victor take a seat and the rivalry between Victor Von Fogg and Zodon becomes immediately apparent. Following this, Miss Kyle drops in on Principal Cranston to question Tyler's presence at PS238. Principal Cranston reveals that Tyler's parents are Ultima and Sovereign Powers, two of the most powerful metahumans on the planet. Their discussion is interrupted by none other than Mr. and Mrs. Powers, who have gifted the school with a teleportation beacon from the Earth Defense League headquarters on the moon, \"for the school's security\". They feel that enrolling Tyler in PS238 will force his powers to manifest. During lunch break Tyler reveals to Suzi that feels he doesn't belong at PS238 because he has no powers. Suzi leaves him alone at his table but he is quickly joined by Cecil, who knows that there is something strange going on at Excelsior Public School and wants Tyler to meet him by the kickball diamond during afternoon recess to talk. After lunch, Tyler is subjected to Coach Rockslide's phys ed class, where the armor Tyler's parents sent with him plays a holo-message from Ultima Powers, encouraging that his son be trained like any other metahuman. Tyler is then forced to partner up with Zodon for the duration of the class period, which is a lesson on throwing opponents and tumbling. This results in Tyler taking a trip to Doctor Newby's office, noting that he's going to be there a lot. During afternoon recess Tyler ponders the danger he's facing due to phys ed class and is interrupted by both Zodon and Victor, both who solicit him to become one of their minions. Tyler then meets up with Cecil, who points out the odd things he's noticed about Ron, Suzi, and the other PS238 students. Cecil asks Tyler to help expose what's going on around the school, and Tyler agrees. This prompts a reaction from the PS238 staff, who are surprised when Tyler lies to Cecil, telling him that all the metahuman children are actually aliens and that he has been sent there by the authorities to keep an eye on things and find out what the aliens are up to. Cecil buys the story, agrees to keep quiet about what he knows, and asks Tyler to mention him to his superiors, noting that he'd love to get a real secret agent badge or decoder ring. Their discussion is interrupted by the recess bell. Tyler's day ends with Herschel showing him his room in the dormitory and leaving him with some new equipment - a pair of \"Bureau of Alien Monitoring\" badges and decoder rings. During this the faculty is discussing Tyler and how they are going to have to train him to survive because they fear the danger his parents will put him in to try to get his powers to manifest. Principal Cranston notes that he has an idea and contacts the Revenant to discuss non-metahuman training for Tyler.</p><p>Back-up Story: Cristina Kyle meets with several super-heroes that have recently been hired as teachers at PS238. She instructs them on how to keep a low profile in their new secret identity roles and make sure they appear to the rest of the world to actually be school teachers. She stresses the need to appear as if they are existing just above the poverty line, points out the need for tote bags, and suggests they all take up an eccentric hobby. The episode ends with the former hero The Human Alloy noting that he's faced down massive threats in the past, but this scares him to death, prompting Cristina to note that a haunted look is good for their cover.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>PS238 #4 Every school has field trips, and ps238 is no exception. However, they go a little farther afield than most: the moon! But this isn't just a rock-hunting sightseeing tour; it's a mission to deliver a very important package! What perils await them there?</em></p><p>Wednesday morning, 4:57 AM. The students of PS238 are preparing to go on a field trip. Zodon, Suzi, Ron, and Kevin all complain of the early hour and look more than a bit bleary-eyed, with Tyler looking more than a bit apprehensive over the whole thing. Their conversation is interrupted by Herschel, Alloy, and Dr. Newby, who help them suit up and collect their permission slips for their trip into outer space. Everyone loads in to the space shuttle, and Herschel entrusts an important package to Tyler. The shuttle launches from a hidden bay under the football field, and they get ready to head for the moon. En route, Mr. Alloy gives them a bit of instruction on the dangers of space, including how to go to the bathroom, which thoroughly grosses out the children. During their approach to the moon an explosive charge detonates inside the shuttle, blasting the children out into space and onto the surface of the moon. A note lets the children know that the charge was placed by Victor Von Fogg, in an attempt to lose Zodon on the moon. The children discuss their situation; while some of them could fly back to earth, that would still leave the lesser-powered stuck on the moon. Thinking that the package might help them, they open it to discover it is a box of \"Yappys Dog Treats\", which appear to be absolutely no help. Tyler remembers that the Earth Defense League's base is on the moon, but never having been outside the base he has no clue where it is located. While the others argue over the next course of action Tyler decides to contact Revenant, who gives him some tips and helps him figure out the reason for the box of dog treats. Tyler discovers dog footprints and convinces the others to join him in following the tracks. During the trip they come across one of the Apollo landing sites and a huge crater that the dog apparently jumps across while running over the lunar surface. Suzi tries to fly across but miscalculates, forcing Captain Clarinet to go after her while Emerald Gauntlet transports the others across. Zodon talks them into not waiting for Ron and Suzi to get back and they continue following the tracks to a small dog kennel, with no dog in it. While examining the kennel they are surprised by the return of Ron and Suzi along with Argo the Wonder Dog. Mr. Clay then turns up and explains that the school staff has been tracking the children with a beacon he placed in Zodon's chair and then goes on to explain that Argo was Ron's father's dog and why Argo now lives on the moon. Mr. Alloy tells the children they're going to go back to the EDL's moon base to be transported back to the school, but not before talking to Herschel about the tracking device - which was really in Tyler's decoder ring. Herschel just wanted to see Zodon go nuts looking for the tracking beacon. While the rest of the kids get beamed back to Earth, Ron spends a few hours romping with Argo. Herschel and Alloy take Ron back to earth with them on the shuttle, noting that Ron will be able to see Argo again and that Argo will always have his eye on Ron, considering the great view he has of where Ron lives.</p><p>Back-up story: Herschel is visited by Harold Reynolds from NASA Logistics wanting to know how PS238 cuts through all the red tape when it comes to space launches. Herschel explains that they get support from a senator that hates metahumans because he and his buddies like approving flights where they know metahumans are going to be shot into orbit. Reynolds proceeds to get a manned mission to Mars approved by claiming it would be used to build an offworld prison for super-criminals.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>PS238 #5 It's a ghost story for meta-human kids in this episode of Ps238! Our school for the children of superheroes has special dormitories for students whose families can't relocate to the area... or if their abilities require it. In this issue, a few of those children go exploring and find that there's more going on in these hallowed halls than even they had imagined!</em></p><p>Tyler is up late in the evening writing in his journal when he hears a knock at his door. He is surprised to be greeted by Ambriel, because the students aren't supposed to be roaming the halls after lights-out. Due to the way Ambriel's guardian angel powers work, the security systems can't see her. Ambriel is bored and looking for something fun to do. Tyler suggests Chinese Checkers, but Ambriel wants to do something interesting and suggests they go bug Zodon. Since Ambriel's powers will shield anyone who is with her, they head for Zodon and Bernard's room. Zodon is just as surprised by their knock on the door and realizing that Ambriel can get past the security systems he offers to name a continent after her once he conquers the world if she tells him how she does it. After some wittey banter, Ambriel declares that she's still bored. Zodon suggests playing \"guess the stain\" in the bathroom, which he doesn't use thanks to Bernard. Tyler questions how he stays clean and he shows them his cyber-chair's Code C134-N, a cleaning program. Ambriel is still bored, so Zodon suggests they have a look at a location in the school that isn't listed on the schematics. Using Ambriel's guardian angel to get them past security, Zodon leads them to a sealed maximum security door. Zodon reprograms the retinal scanner on the door to accept the input of a marble in order to leave no evidence and the group enter the security zone. Once inside the door slams shut behind them. Zodon curses at it and Ambriel notes the word substitution for Zodon's swearing. Tyler explains it and Ambriel accidentally trips off Zodon's cleaning program by mentioning its code number. The group explore the zone further and discover windows that allow a view of the bedrock outside the walls. Further exploration turns up \"U of J\" logos on the walls, which are similar to the ones on the school's vehicles and hardware components. Shortly after this the group discover that they are actually on the buried remains of a space station. The group lets Bernard mindlessly bang on one of the computer keyboards they have found while having a look around and Bernard manages to randomly guess Mantium's password (much to Zodon's chagrin). With computer access, the group finds that the satellite was called \"The Beacon of Justice\" and still appears to be mostly operational. To keep Bernard from pushing anymore buttons Zodon throws an ink pen down one of the stairwells, where Bernard runs into a ghostly apparition. Zodon discovers an on-board fusion reactor, Ambriel begins to get bored, and Tyler finds out that the satellite was previously the property of the \"Union of Justice\". A very frightened Bernard comes barrelling back into the room and plows into Tyler. The group go to investigate what spooked Bernard and find the floating apparition, which attacks them. The apparition ignores the boys and repeatedly attacks Ambriel, repelled by her guardian angel each time. Bernard grabs a chunk of nearby console and flings it through the apparition, bursting some water pipes in the process. The blast of water causes the apparition to discorporate and the group make a break for the door. Their victory is short lived, however, as the apparition re-forms and beats them to the door. It speaks to the group, saying it wants the girl's body and the rest can go free. Tyler has Ambriel stand in front of Zodon, with Bernard holding Zodon down. Tyler speaks to the apparition, telling it that it can have the girl. The ghost dives for Ambriel, remarking that it will finally have a new host. At the last second, Ambriel dives out of the way and the spirit slams into Zodon. Tyler activates Zodon's cleaning program, keeping the ghost tied up until the program finishes. With the moments they have gained, Tyler uses one of his own marbles to re-open the door and the group get outside, barely closing the door in time to keep the apparition trapped. With security alerted, the foursome make an escape into an access panel at a dead-end hallway. Herschel comes to the door to check it and is greeted by a message on its control screen, \"I still miss you, husband.\" The group opts to wait in the access panel until Herschel goes away and while they do they look at the papers Tyler grabbed from the space station. One of which is a picture of the Union of Justice and its members, Positron, Spell Syrin, Rockslide, Micro-Might, Mantium, and Aurora. Tyler notes that he thinks a few of their teachers used to do something else before they started working at PS238.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>What happens when students get thrown into the middle of politics? Sometimes the outcome surprises even the adults. Also, a back-up story introduces a new student.</em></p><h4>Main Story</h4><p>Our story opens with Gord and Ed preparing to shake down the new kid in class for his lunch money. Unfortunately for them, they are unable to lay a hand on Dillon as he dodges or deflects every attempted blow. He walks away unscathed, noting that his orders prevent him from giving them a thrashing. Gord and Ed then decide to pick on the other new kid, Jenny, who stuns Gord with a touch to the wrist, leaving him unable to anything more than stand there and whimper. She also walks away unharmed. Gord and Ed are then accosted by camera crews with release forms, wanting the boys to sign off on them for the footage they just captured. The camera crews are quickly hustled away by Miss Kyle, who strongly reminds them they were told to stay off the playground during school hours.</p><p>Miss Kyle then complains to Principal Cranston that this was the second time she has caught the video crews making a scene. Principal Cranston promises to have a word with them yet again. Miss Kyle asks if this is going to happen every election year, to which Principal Cranston replies that since Freedom Fighter isn't going to last forever both political parties are grooming their own replacement. Unfortunately, PS238 gives them the biggest opprotunity to launch their campaigns. Their conversation is interrupted by a PA announcement requesting Principal Cranston come to conference room two to discuss the school's textbooks with their \"guests from Washington\". He says that if he is still in the meeting an hour from now then Ms. Kyle should have Herschel vent reactor coolant into the conference room air ducts. Herschel just happens to be passing by and notes the amount of cameras he has been finding all over the school. Cristina notes that would be the doing of their friends from the government. Herschel remarks that he missed something and asks who is at the school. They are interrupted by Dillon, now in his USA Patriot Act costume, who asks them for directions to the bathroom. Herschel points him in the right direction and he leaves with camera crew in tow. As Herschel yells after them to keep the cameras out of the bathroom they are again interrupted, this time by Jenny in her American Eagle costume, who is looking for Mr. Alloy's Science classroom. Herschel asks Cristina to fill him in on what's going on.</p><p>In the meantime, Principal Cranston has his hands full with the government representatives. Despite the school's textbooks being purchased from state-approved vendors the government staff feels that the books contain several passages that are biased against their ideals. In reality, they are both looking to further their candidates in the race to replace Freedom Fighter, America's hero. Cristina and Herschel are busy discussing the goings-on. The \"flag-wearing squirts\", as Herschel calls them, are going to try to out-American each other in front of their handler's cameras.</p><p>Mr. Alloy's science class is a prime example of this. During a discussion on the spectrum of light the class members are asked to pick their favorite colors and tell what they like about it. While the rest of the students give normal answers, USA Patriot Act and American Eagle give sound-bite worthy answers on the colors red and blue, respectively. Their speeches are met with applause - from their handlers. Mr. Alloy reminds the handlers that he has the authority to send all of them to detention if they don't knock it off.</p><p>The teachers discuss what to do about the situation. Coach Rockslide hopes that they'll be ok in his gym class next period. He plans to have his class continue their unit on basketball, but the handlers want some good film clips and ask him to do something more \"combat-oriented\". Coach stands his ground and tells them no way, the kids will be learning basketball. USA Patriot Act interrupts them with an appearance in the gym doorway, on his motorbike. He revs his way across the floor, snags a basketball, and sinks a basket. Coach yells at him to get the motorbike off the floor because he's leaving skid marks. As he does this, American Eagle flies in, ordering USA Patriot Act to stand down. Their handler overrides Coach's authority and eggs them on to play some one-on-one. Dillon and Jenny then begin to chase the basketball back and forth across the court until Dillon pegs Jenny with a throwing disc, prompting her to try to blast him. In the ensuing back-and-forth Dillon misses a shot at Jenny and one of her blasts goes awry, zapping Captain Clarinet and Suzi. This angers the rest of the children, who then attack the pair, causing great damage to the gym in the process. The pair's handlers dismiss the amount of destruction, saying that the other students attacked Dillon and Jenny over a misunderstanding and that the whole thing was caused by a lack of discipline on the school's behalf. Principal Cranston notes that a direct protest against this is going to do no good, but he has an idea.</p><p>Meanwhile, the two candidates are trading barbs on the playground. They are interrupted by both Zodon and Victor Von Fogg, who solicit the pair to become their minions. The project director brings Miss Kyle a set of documents for the voting project, to replace the ones that accidentally fell in the shredder earlier.</p><p>Miss Kyle is then forced to have her class vote to see whether USA Patriot Act or American Eagle gets to be the \"Official Protector of Student Liberty and Guardian of Constitutional Values at PS238\". The students are less than enthused by this. Zodon remarks that if this were a real election they'd need about half the class to not participate and have a small minority cast write-in votes for a candiate with no hopes of winning. This gives the class an idea.</p><p>The next day a class assembly is called in the hangar bay, due to the gym being under reconstruction. The winner of the election is announced, and it is... Tyler Marlocke! The class picked him as a write-in candidate because he doesn't have superpowers and they knew his victory would tick off the \"flag twins\". Tyler accepts the victory gracefully and asks Principal Cranston what his duties will be. The principal notes that they don't know yet, but they'll come up with something. The project director congratulates Principal Cranston on a well-orchestrated stunt and notes that due to this setback they will have to pack it in. The directory hints that Mr. Cranston and his powers had something to do with it, but the principal notes that he had nothing to do with it. Both USA Patriot Act and American Eagle concede victory to Tyler and almost immediately begin trying to out-American the other one on camera in anticipation of the class election next year. Their verbal argument begins to escalate as the principal takes Tyler to the conference room to discuss his duties. Among his duties will be Hall Monitor, giving a presentation on the Constitution on President's Day, and acting as the official ribbon cutter for the re-opening of the newly repaired hangar bay.</p><h4>Back-Up Story</h4><p>Vashti invites Miss Kyle to join her in meeting a new student for PS238. They teleport to a neutral realm and meet with a mixed-marriage couple - an angel who is a Seraphim general and his demon lover. They bring forth their son, Malpahst, who they need to keep secret from both the forces of good and the forces of evil. They feel that if he were discovered that it would make his life very hard, so they want him to stay with the humans for now, so he can learn and decide what he wants his own destiny to be. They give Vashti a scrying sphere so they can be contacted, a list of spells and wards that may be used if he misbehaves, and a list of things to which he reacts \"poorly\", like beets and dairy products. Cristina notes that they might be able to help with that, which pleases the Seraphim, as he would like his son to have a favorite flavor of ice cream. Vashti and Cristina are then transported back, with Malphast in tow. Cristina welcomes Malphast, who also seems excited about the ice cream. Vashti promises to have Doctor Newby look into it. Doctor Positron notes that they have a new student, who appears to have supernatural powers. Cristina agrees, and notes that the real thing that will drive Positron nuts is trying to figure out how the son of an angel and demon is lactose intolerant.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Most students would spend their time working on a history report poring through books and writing notes, but it is much easier when history comes to you and can tell you what happened! In a back-up story, we're introduced to a new student who has a knack for being able to pimp anyone's ride, whether they want it to be or not!</em></p><h4>Main Story</h4><p>Cristina stands by the snack machine as Mrs. Oberon comes by to grab a candy bar to make up for her missed lunch. It turns out she has been put in charge of coordinating the history reports that the children of both Excelsior and PS238 will be presenting and she has to give the approval for any topic submitted. Much to her chagrin, every child seems to want to do a report on a superhero. As she and Cristina turn to leave the snack machine, one of the children comes up to submit his group's proposal for a report on George Washington. Mrs. Oberon is so pleased she gives the child her candy bar.</p><p>Suzi, Tyler, Zodon, and Tom are gathered around a table in the library, discussing their potential choice, Mister Extraordinary. Although there is little recorded information on the hero, Tom comes up with a new way to get the story, using his power of time travel. He teleports himself back to the early 1900s and returns with Naomi Booker, the daughter of Mister Extraordinary. They talk her into telling them the story of her father and why he disappeared from the public eye.</p><p>She recounts the history of her life with her father to them. The origin of his powers is unknown, but they were discovered after his WW I unit unit was shelled and he came out of the battle with barely a scratch. His \"nom de cape\" was given to him by a reporter who was a friend. Following the war he simply wanted to return to his life with his wife and daughter, but he was contacted by a talent agency who contracted him to do performances across the United States. He was presented his trademark sash by the Women's League of Chicago after a show there. He thwarted a kidnapping attempt on Naomi during a show in Ohio. While Naomi was unharmed in this attempt, it caused strained relations between Thaddeus and his wife Vivian.</p><p>Following the kidnapping attempt on Naomi, Thaddeus was contacted by FBI and conscripted into doing work for them by agent Miles Griffin. Although Thaddeus did not speak of these events to his wife and child, they did see the results of his adventures in the headlines of the newspapers. Among his exploits, he assisted the FBI in vice-squad raids, stopped sabotage attempts, rescued ambassadors, and helped break up worker strikes.</p><p>This work for the FBI did not please Thaddeus because even though he was initially tasked with obviously heroic deeds, such as stopping bank robbers, he was now being charged with stopping people because their ideas were a threat to the country. This did not sit well with Thaddeus and he began to question his work for the government.</p><p>Mister Extraordinary's last job for the government was one that he refused to complete. He was given the task of breaking up a suspected communist cell, but found out that many of the suspected communists were men that he served with in the war. He planned on refusing the mission but his wife and family were threatened with deportation to Siberia by his government liaison. In order to protect his family, he instructed his wife to publicly denounce him to the media and he would leave his family. He explained this to Naomi and even though she didn't understand why he had to do what he was going to do, she agreed to do what her mother and father said to do. He escaped the next morning using his power of flight, which he had previously kept secret from his government handlers.</p><p>While he may have disappeared from public view, Mister Extraordinary continued to visit his daughter at night and frequently took her for flights.</p><p>Before Tom takes Naomi back to her her original point in time, he takes a picture of her with their group for evidence of her presence in the future. The group presents their report to the school and receives an \"A\" for their work. Tom takes a note from their group back in time to thank Naomi for her help and to let her know the outcome of their report.</p><h4>Back-Up Story</h4><p>Principal Cranston asks Herschel to interview a potential student that may be attending PS238. Herschel notes that he's not a teacher, to which the principal replies that he may need to consider running a shop class. Principal Cranston gives Herschel a folder on Angela and tells him that she's waiting in the shuttle repair bay.</p><p>Herschel arrives in the repair bay to be greeted by a resounding WHAM, caused by Angela tearing apart one of the shuttles so she can improve it. She rigs the shuttle to ignite its thrusters with such force that it would burn up all of its fuel within a minute and a half. Herschel notes that anyone riding in the cabin would be turned into chunky salsa, to which Angela replies that they just need an airbag. Herschel looks on as she talks about possible upgrades for the shuttle, such as some neon, gold trim, and LEDs for the landing gears, to really pimp out the ride. He also notes that the canopy has been destroyed, which Angela explains as a small malfunction in the sound system. She then continues on like a whirlwind of upgrading and destruction as Herschel grasps his head in disbelief.</p><p>Herschel later meets with Principal Cranston and gives his approval for Angela to attend the school despite her being a bit older than most of the kids. He then runs down a laundry list of the \"improvements\" and destruction she has wrought on the shuttle bay. Principal Cranston questions why he would want her at PS238, to which Herschel replies that he's spent too much of his life making the world a better place to have somebody accidentally blow it up by trying to make everything go faster.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Every story has a beginning, and sometimes those unfinished bits of the past can come back to haunt the present. What could cause a metahuman to hold a grudge against the world?</em></p><p>Ms. Oberon, teacher of the Rainmaker Program at PS238, attempts to get everyone in her class to calm down and back in their seats. One of her students, Lyle, wants to give a history presentation, just like the other students got to a few weeks ago. The students are confused; some of them thought Lyle wasn't even able to speak. Before Lyle can begin his report, Zachary pops up from an underground tunnel. He was helping Herschel and Zodon lay some cables under the school. Once Zachary takes his seat Ms. Oberon re-introduces Lyle to the class. Lyle can see patterns in the world around us and can deduce great amounts of information from these observations. So much so that it's painful to the point of causing him to pass out. As such, Lyle spends most of his time in a white room listening to music. He came out of his white room to give his report because if he didn't, bad things would happen. Ms. Oberon encourages him to start his report, on the original Rainmaker Project.</p><p>Lyle recounts the events of the past. The original Rainmaker Program was started in 1960 and had one person in it, Harold Nelson. Harold was gifted with the ability to manipulate weather and cause it to rain or stop raining. He was also the first person with powers that the government could safely study. Every other metahuman before him was too dangerous to contain. The government hoped they could find out where super powers came from.</p><p>In an attempt to further the study of Harold's abilities, the government made a deal with the cyborg super-villain Doctor Irons, who was incarcerated for bank robbery. Doctor Irons had metatechnologist abilities and the ability to create devices decades ahead of their time. Using the government's funding he built a machine that was supposedly similar to an MRI. This device was to be used to scan Harold's body and brain as he used his powers. In reality the machine was designed to temporarily enhance the abilities of young Harold. As Harold lay on the bed of the machine, Doctor Irons uses his robotic voicebox to generate subliminal-level sound and communicate with Harold. He tells Harold that the story of Harold being an orphan is a lie and that his parents don't even know he is alive. He compounds this by enticing Harold to want to escape from the prison the government has created for him. Using his machine he boosts Harold's powers to the point where Harold is able to generate an enormous thunderstorm outside the building. This thunderstorm is able to generate massive bolts of lightning and one blows a hole in the wall of the test chamber. Harold notes that he can't make the storm stop, to which Doctor Irons replies that was the idea. As Doctor Irons makes to leave, a stray bolt of lightning blows his body to pieces, causing his head unit, which encases his brain and is still functioning, to land on Harold's lap. Harold makes a run for it with Doctor Irons' head in hand. As they run, Harold notes that they should stay away from running water and high places. He notes this just as a wall of water from a flash-flood comes bearing down upon them.</p><p>Much to Harold's surprise, he is rescued at the last second by a young Ul-Ron Peterson, who will someday become the hero known as Atlas. Ron swoops down and carries Harold up into the sky, bearing him safely to the Peterson farm. Ron's father chides him for \"showing off\" and reminds him that the fewer people that get a clear look at him the better. Mr. Peterson tells Harold he can stay at the farm if he pulls his weight. He also notes the head of Doctor Irons, which he takes to be some kind of modern art, and places in Ron's room. Ron then begins to show Harold around the farm and explain his chores to him.</p><p>Later that evening Harold and Ron are resting on the porch, discussing the work of the day. Ron explains to Harold that he can fly, lift heavy things, and can't be hurt. He takes Harold to the nearby barn and shows him the spaceship that brought him to Earth. Mr. Peterson discovers this and yells at Ron, sending him to his room without supper. He then swears Harold to secrecy, says that he hopes Harold likes it there, and notes that it'll be good to have someone else around that can feel an honest day's work in their bones. This angers Ron, who has been listening from the roof of the barn. He flies back into his room, muttering about how he's not his father's favorite anymore. Doctor Irons speaks to Ron, enticing him to believe that he can help Ron get rid of his \"inconvenience\" in exchange for access to certain machines and tools from the farm.</p><p>The next morning Ron and Harold are over a mile from the farmhouse, ostensibly to mend fences on the south pasture. In reality, Ron has retrieved the Project: Rainmaker sign from the ruins of the compound and tacked it up on one of the fence posts. He has also placed Doctor Irons' head on top of a scarecrow nearby. Ron accuses Harold of hiding his own secrets. Doctor Irons eggs him on, telling him that Harold is a criminal and subliminally telling Ron that Harold is a liar, wants to confuse him, steal his father, and destroy the farm.</p><p>As Ron moves to incapacitate Harold, Harold reflexively activates a previously unseen power and disables Ron's abilities. He then says that Ron's father love Ron and if Harold has to leave to make sure things don't get messed up then he will. Harold takes Doctor Irons' head down from the scarecrow, makes it start to rain, and then leaves Ron lying there on the ground.</p><p>The story flips back to the present at this time. Lyle notes that Ron never saw Harold again but while he was lying in the mud something else happened. At that point his presentation is interrupted by Ms. Kyle, who needs to talk to Ms. Oberon. Lyle knew Ms. Kyle would be there and he needed to finish his report when the teacher couldn't hear because certain people needed to know certain things, otherwise bad stuff would happen.</p><p>Lyle continues. Ron is still sitting in the mud when Tom Davidson appears from a time warp behind him. Tom explains to Ron that everything is going to be fine. Ron's power loss is only temporary and he'll be back to normal in half an hour. Harold will be ok eventually and Ron only did what he did because Doctor Irons was able to get inside his head with his voice trick. Ron says that his dad is going to be really mad. Tom gives him a note to give to his father that he says will explain everything. Ron questions why he'll believe this, and Tom says he was the one that convinced Ron's father to adopt him. Tom then notes that he has to wait for someone. Within a matter of seconds Zodon appears from a time warp, with Tyler Marlocke and a school desk in tow. Zodon curses at his timeslip device and then disappears again, leaving Tyler and his desk behind in the rainstorm. Tom greets Tyler, welcoming him to August twelfth, 1966. Tom introduces Tyler to Ul-Ron, noting that someday he will become Atlas. Ron asks who Atlas is and how Tom knows his whole name. Tom says that Ron will see. Tyler asks about Zodon, to which Tom replies that they'll deal with him soon enough, and then he reminds Ron to give the note to his father. Tom says they'll say \"hi\" to Ron's son for him, they say their goodbyes, and then disappear through a time warp.</p><p>Lyle wraps up his report by noting that Harold made his way west, holding several jobs and getting an education. He later sued the government and won some money, and is still alive. He also notes that Harold has heard about the new Rainmaker Program and is going to come to the school, but has a way to go yet.</p><p>Several weeks later, we see a van entering a small town in Missouri. A bearded man with a wide-brimmed hat steps out and talks to the people of the town, saying that the rainmaker has come. He then causes it to rain and asks them for the fee he was promised when they spoke on the phone. The townspeople can't pay him, but they do let him fill up his gas tank. Harold climbs back into the van and talks to Doctor Irons' head, which is still functional. Doctor Irons is pushing him to continue their mission, Operation: \"Rainmaker Rescue\", so they can keep the kids from suffering the same fate as Harold did. But does Doctor Irons have ulterior motives?</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Sometimes a little extra-curricular education is necessary, especially when the student in question doesn't really have powers to begin with. In a back-up story, Tyler and his friends stop an attempted shoplifting at the local convenience store.</em></p><h4>Main Story</h4><p>Tyler sits on the steps of PS238, writing in his diary and waiting for his ride. He notes that he has been at PS238 for a few months now and can't believe that he is still alive, considering he doesn't have super powers. He laments that his parents put him there in hopes his powers would appear, because it doesn't matter if you're going to have powers someday if a classmate drops a couple hundred pounds of metal on you and you get squished. He notes that his parents never really tell him what they're doing because they don't want him to worry. As he continues to write he is interrupted by Angela and Prospero, who appear from a tunnel that opens up beside Tyler. Angie notes that if an old guy with a beard comes by looking for whoever made a mess in lab twelve, he didn't see them. She also suggests that if he sees a green compound oozing up from the sidewalk he shouldn't touch it. Angie and Prospero wander off to parts unknown as Tyler's ride arrives. It is a car sent by Revenant. Revenant reminds Tyler to use the code phrase he was assigned before getting into the car because you don't want to be getting into cars with the wrong sorts of people.</p><p>Tyler hops in the back of the car and chats with Revenant for a bit before discovering that Revenant really isn't in the car, but instead is piloting it remotely via the Omnidrive system. he suggests Tyler buckle up as the system will allow the car to avoid oncoming cars as well as law enforcement agents. Tyler ends up in a vehicle that can do 135 miles per hour on city streets.</p><p>Tyler arrives safely, albeit a bit shaken, at his destination, the Super Natural Gymnasium. Revenant instructs him to go inside to the last stall in the bathroom, where a secret door will open for him. He ends up having to sneak past the receptionist because he doesn't have a gym membership.</p><p>Revenant welcomes Tyler to his \"office\", which exists over the top of the gym. He has Tyler put his things in a storage room and instructs Tyler to pick out any equipment he thinks he might need in addition to the mandatory hero costume that Revenant has set up for him. Tyler comes out a bit overdressed for the occasion. Revenant notes that he can't reasonably expect to go out on patrol with all that equipment strapped to him, then notes that was likely Tyler's plan in the first place. Tyler doesn't deny it.</p><p>Revenant has Tyler ditch about twenty pounds of the excess gear and then they head out to the top of a building for Tyler's first lesson in getting around town with a grappling hook gauntlet. Revenant shows Tyler how to launch the grappler and how to tell if it is set properly, and then instructs him to go ahead and jump off the building. Tyler notes that he thought the whole idea was to teach him how to not get hurt or killed. Revenant notes that he is proud of Tyler because he exhibits wisdom and common sense beyond his years. He then proceeds to go ahead and push Tyler off the ledge.</p><p>As the pair swing across to the other building, Tyler screams and Revenant notes that getting around by grappling hook isn't the fastest mode of transport. He then explains that since a grappler takes up so much space it is best to make it a multi-purpose unit. They attempt a landing on a nearby rooftop. Tyler slams into a flagpole, which hurt a little, but he's glad to be back on solid ground. After Tyler regains his composure, Revenant asks him to bring out his homework - a mystery that they are supposed to solve. Tyler provides him with the picture of the Union of Justice he took from their buried satellite. he notes that he wants to know who his teachers were and why their space station is part of PS238. Revenant thinks they should go meet with someone who has the answers. Tyler is afraid they will have to swing from buildings to get there, to which Revenant explains that their car is below. They hop in and speed to their destination, much to Tyler's chagrin.</p><p>When they get there, Revenant shows Tyler how to immediately launch and reel in his grapple line as soon as it hits something. Tyler gets stuck hanging from a gargoyle, to which Revenant notes they'll work on dismounts and using ledges tomorrow. They then swing to the next rooftop over and enter the offices of the Consultant via her skylight. As they drop in, the Consultant asks Revenant if he has an appointment, noting that she has become more popular since his last visit. Revenant notes that the politcos should be concerned that she has a policy of \"I sell the secrets you sell me\", to which she replies that she thinks that one side thinks the other side doesn't know about her. Tyler, still dangling from his grappler, prods Revenant into asking about his mystery.</p><p>Revenant introduces Tyler as \"Moon Shadow\". He explains this to Tyler by saying he has been listening to a lot of Cat Stevens lately. He hands the consultant the picture of the Union of Justice and asks her to sell them the information on who these people were and what happened to them. She asks Moon Shadow to reel in his line so she can close the skylight. Tyler notes that his grappler appears to be stuck. As they discuss this, the Consultant notices that someone has just swooped into her office and grabbed some sensitive documents from her desk. She asks Revenant and Moon Shadow to retrieve them.</p><p>As Revenant and Moon Shadow reach the roof, Revenant recognizes the burglar. It is the Kestrel, a low-level telekinetic and professional burglar. She uses her powers to glide and float to reach the entrances to buildings and to get away. He also notes she uses talons in her gloves, so they need to be careful of that. The pair attempt to swoop down on her from above. Revenant misses the Kestrel as she dodges him, but her dodge carries her right into the path of Moon Shadow's line, which wraps around the both of them. The tension in the line causes both of them to slam into a nearby wall on a rooftop. Kestrel frees herself from the line, which is still attached to the wall. Revenant tells her to hand over the package, but as he does he is attacked from behind by the Highwayman, who phases through a wall. Moon Shadow tries to get the package back, but is taken hostage by Kestrel, who leaps from the rooftop with him under her arm. Unfortunately she forgot that his line was still attached to the upper roof and the pair again slam into the wall below the roof's ledge. The masonry holding the grappler gives way and the pair go plummeting towards the pavement, further tangling them in the grappler's line.</p><p>Moon Shadow desperately tries the different gadgets on his belt as they speed towards impact with the sidewalk. One after another the gadgets fail to do anything useful until suddenly Kestrel and Moon Shadow are engulfed in a series of airbags. They impact the pavement with a bounce, alive, but stuck in the airbags. Kestrel uses her claws and teeth to shred their way out and prepares to do serious harm to Moon Shadow. Moon Shadow points one of his gadgets at her, which makes a \"bleep\" noise and apparently does nothing else. Kestrel makes light of this and as she prepares to tear into Moon Shadow she is zapped from behind by Revenant's stun baton. Moon Shadow notes that it was lucky he found the airbags on his belt, to which Revenant notes that was part of his mandatory equipment, designed to go off if he approached the ground at high speed. As Revenant notes that he has Highwayman tied up, they discover that he has gotten free using his phasing powers. Highwayman then makes his escape with both Kestrel and the records from the Consultant's office.</p><p>Revenant and Moon Shadow return to the Consultant's office to deliver the bad news. The Consultant is disappointed in this turn of events. Revenant apologizes to Moon Shadow and notices he is messing with the gadget that was used on Kestrel earlier. He prepares to explain to moon Shadow what the device is when he notices the readings it took. He asks the Consultant if her files on Kestrel are limited, to which she replies yes. The Revenant hands the device to the Consultant, explaining that the unit was designed to \"see\" through walls using sonar, radar, thermograph, and other means. He also notes that it apparently is able to do fairly detailed medical scans. The scan shows discolored patches on her chest and nose; she's apparently had some \"work\" done. The Consultant notes that they can use this when she gets in touch with the Kestrel.</p><p>The next evening comes and Revenant and Moon Shadow are waiting on a rooftop. The Kestrel meets them there and returns the package she stole, unopened. She calls Revenant a jerk and threatens him if he ever tells anyone about what he knows. Revenant replies that he won't breathe a word, but the Consultant might, considering she sells information for a living. He instructs Kestrel to meet with the Consultant at midnight. Kestrel leaves, again threatening them with pain if the information gets out. Moon Shadow is a bit confused by this turn of events. Revenant notes that Kestrel has had \"work\" done. Moon Shadow doesn't get the reference. Revenant tries to obliquely explain it, but it's pretty obvious that Moon Shadow still doesn't get it.</p><p>The following Monday, Tyler returns to classes at PS238. He greets Ms. Kyle, and she is relieved to find out that his weekend adventures didn't require a visit to the school nurse. Tyler also notes that he's supposed to take shop class with Mr. Clay so he can learn how to fix his equipment. Ms. Kyle asks him if there was anything else. Tyler scans her with his device, looks at the results, and asks her if she's ever had any \"work\" done. Tyler then finds himself in detention after class, explaining to Zodon that he really doesn't understand why he's there.</p><h4>Back-Up Story</h4><p>The local convenience store. The last bastion of after-school hangouts. And the K-Square Convenience Store is where the kids from PS238 go to buy their snacks. We find Kevin Kramer and Ron Peterson looking over the candy. Ron can't decide between Gobstoppers and Bazooka gum. Kevin notes that the Gobstoppers would last a lot longer because the gum's flavor runs out quickly. The jawbreakers could last all day if you suck on them one at a time. Ron didn't know you were supposed to suck on them, and was just chewing them up with his super-strong teeth. Zodon, Suzi, and Tyler come up behind the pair. Suzi explains to Zodon that shopping for candy is fun. Zodon points out that they could take a tip from the mortal who is putting a box of snack cakes in his coat. The super-powered kids want to stop him, but they're not supposed to use their powers in public. They push Tyler to stop him - literally. Kevin moves Tyler over by the thief and says that Tyler has something to say. Tyler tells the boy, who is bigger than him, that he should put the cakes back because he didn't pay for them. The kid looks like he is going to start something with Tyler, but is held back by the presence of the store's clerk, directly behind him. He tosses the box of snack cakes aside and threatens Tyler on his way out of the store, noting that he's seen Tyler at school before. The children (except for Tyler) are elated that they stopped the crime in progress and Tyler even got his own arch-nemesis. Tyler notes that he doesn't even know who the kid is. Zodon tells them that his name is Charles Brigman. He knows this because he has the boy's library card. And wallet. And his lunch money. Zodon picked Charles's pocket as he stormed out of the store. Zodon then proceeds to use the money from Charles's wallet to pay for their snacks. Tyler questions this, to which Zodon notes that none of them know what \"accessory after the fact\" means, so they should treasure their innocence.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>A group project for Shop class takes a turn for the worse when an old weapon intended for another group of heroes comes around to haunt Tyler and his friends.</i></p><p>Herschel Clay opens his session of Shop Class by noting that scorch marks clean up well if the right solvents are used and they can barely tell there was a succession of explosions in the classroom a few days ago that cost thousands of dollars worth of damage. He then notes that he'd like to keep it that way and moves on to checking the students' homework.</p><p>Zodon was assigned to construct a simple laser using a flashlight and binocular lenses. Unfortunately for Zodon, it was confiscated by Miss Kyle. Herschel reminds him to leave future projects in the work area. Victor VonFogg was given a solar-powered calculator and an old floppy drive, and was assigned to merge the two so that the calculator could read floppies. Victor took it upon himself to reconfigure the kit to be able to generate the launch codes for every nuclear arsenal in the USA. Fortunately for the rest of the world, he doesn't have his driver's license and can't make the trip on his own. Tyler was assigned to take apart his arm-mounted grappling unit and reassemble it. Upon test-firing it, Tyler is nearly blown out of his seat from the force of the cable's launch. It turns out Angela helped him soup-up the grappler. Herschel admonishes her to let Tyler do his own work and then moves on to checking her work. For her project she selected a tape deck, a fuel line hose, and an air freshener, using them to construct an air-breather that will provide the user with an hour of pine-scented air. It also happens to act as a flamethrower if the user has a source of fire handy, such as a Zippo, which she has with her. After nearly getting singed, Herschel confiscates the lighter until the end of class and then moves on to Prospero. Prospero apparently selected an old toaster and a Nintendo Entertainment System, which he uses to produce two perfectly toasted slices of bread out of thin air.</p><p>Herschel then goes on to note that as this is the third week of shop class they will be starting on group projects, split into two teams. He pairs Zodon and Victor on one team, and Tyler, Angela, and Prospero on the other. He then explains the nature of the project. Each team will be given ten pounds of dilatant compound. They are to create something that exploits its unique properties, but no explosives. He then distributes the compound to the teams and lets them start brainstorming. Angie and Tyler quickly discover that the dilatant compound is what is commonly called Silly Putty. Tyler shows Angie how it can be used to copy newsprint as well as bounce when rolled into a ball. Angie and Prospero quickly come up with a plan to super-charge the silly putty's bounce ability and ask Tyler to meet them topside after class that afternoon.</p><p>Tyler meets up with the pair after school and they head for Angie's house. Angie's father ran a junkyard when they lived in St. Louis and when they moved so Angie could attend PS238 he bought a junkyard in the vicinity. Angie gives them the tour of the yard and then takes them to her \"mission control\" area, which she built from old cars, buses, and planes with Prospero's help. They pile into a small area of the \"fort\" and then, much to Tyler's surprise, they launch into orbit! Angie and Prospero's makeshift shuttlecraft is designed to fire its rockets in a jerky sequence that makes liftoff a bit rough but masks the noise of the launch by sounding like someone's car stereo with the bass turned all the way up. Angie has also fitted it with air-producing capability as well as a transponder box that she swiped from one of the school's shuttles.</p><p>As they reach the proper orbital level Angie has Prospero make ready with a docking line so they can land on a rather ramshackle satellite. In order to dock the line hooks on to a rail on the satellite and causes the shuttle to whip around it, landing on the docking plate. Unfortunately, this causes Tyler to lose his lunch.</p><p>Once they have docked and boarded the satellite, Tyler questions its presence in orbit. Angie notes that when she was looking for a place in orbit she found a satellite that was being brought down in a controlled fall, which she took to be a \"vacancy\" sign. She then started launching her own space junk into the same spot and lashed it together. Prospero has helped her make improvements on the satellite since they met, such as adding a large telescope. Angie has Tyler suit up so he and Prospero can do work on the silly putty outside the space station.</p><p>While outside working on the compound, Tyler notices something small and metal heading towards their space station. Angie notes that she's not picking it up on her sensors and has Tyler and Prospero hurry back inside after securing the putty. Once the pair are back inside, Angie explains her plans to Tyler - that they're going to make the putty MEGA-BOUNCE. By adding chemicals to the silly putty they have made its surface strength immeasurably stronger and made the putty itself nearly indestructible. Angie speculates that they might even be able to make it bounce back and hit the moon. As Tyler notes that his parents' defense grid won't like that, the station gets an unwelcome visitor - the metallic item Tyler spotted earlier.</p><p>Once the item hits the station's hull, it begins broadcasting a recording - from Doctor VonFogg, Victor's father. The item is an explosive mine that was designed to attach itself to the Union of Justice's satellite when at least three members were on board. The mine has magnetically sealed the hull and is set to detonate in ten minutes.</p><p>Tyler questions Angie as to whether or not it was the Union of Justice's satellite that was formerly in the location of her station. She notes that she doesn't know, she just took the spot they left. They bemoan the fact that the hull is sealed and as such they won't be able to remove the mine. Angie is more concerned that she won't get to see the putty do its bounce. This gives Tyler an idea - if they can get the putty to bounce at the right angle, they can use it to knock the mine off of the station when it comes back. Prospero and Angie begin crunching numbers and send Tyler down to the airlock where the launch controls are located - a game boy, duct-taped to the wall. Angie gives Tyler a button sequence to press, and the putty launches towards Earth.</p><p>Somewhere in farm country, a farmer is out inspecting his wheat field. He is shocked to see a gigantic pink blob impact on the field, leaving a perfect crop circle. He then runs, yelling for his wife Martha to save the cows, because the aliens are coming! Meanwhile, back on the space station, Tyler paces the floor as Angie and Prospero play with portable game systems. They watch the video of Doctor VonFogg as he gleefully counts down the last twenty seconds of lifetime for the Union of Justice. After he reaches nineteen, the putty impacts with the mine, engulfing it and tearing it off the wing of the space station. As the countdown reaches one, the mine explodes inside the supercharged silly putty, causing it to form a giant pink sphere, much to Angie's delight.</p><p>The next day, shop class reconvenes and the threesome explains their project to Herschel. He initially doesn't buy their story, but then uses his contacts in NASA to check up on it. Much to his surprise, they confirm the tale of a giant pink sphere appearing in orbit. He notes to the children that they should turn in their formulas and he will give them an A on the project. He then turns to Zodon and Victor to see what they came up with. Despite their constant arguing, they were able to turn the silly putty into a nanoelastic programmable putty that could have possible evil purposes - if the two could ever agree on what those purposes are. Herschel scratches his head and asks the others if they want to go look for something big and pink in orbit.</p><p>Epilogue: Somewhere in farm country, Martha is arguing with her husband Todd. He has set up a stand to charge people for viewing the \"alien crop circle\", which Martha thinks is a stupid idea. As she storms off to the farmhouse she yells at Todd to tear down the stand and get back to work. Todd sits behind the stand, sulking, when he is surprised by the sound of rockets firing in a bass-drum pattern. Angie and Prospero's shuttle sets down by his stand, and Angie pokes her head out the hatch. At Prospero's insistence, she apologies for the damages to his field and in compensation she gives him three loaves of bread and a jar of peanut butter. Prospero then shoots him with a ping-pong ball from his gun, indicating that he thinks the farmer is an ok guy, and they close the hatch and lift off. Later, Martha is back at Todd's stand. He has amended his pricing to include a sale on Space Peanut-butter sandwiches. Martha is still dubious of the whole thing, and still thinks Todd is a little bit crazy.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>What happens when a game of Foursquare takes on supernatural proportions? In a back-up story, the kids of PS238 take a turn at playing baseball - without limiting their powers!</i></p><h4>Main Story</h4><p>The day opens with Vashti Imperia's supernatural studies class. She explains that their new unit will be over supernatural weaponry and its use in the twentieth century, but first has to remind the children that they are not to be casting spells above-ground during recess. She notes a number of incidents she has had to put a stop to, including one attempt at organizing a game involving broomsticks and a flying ball. She adds that she encourages the children to read, but their school is not Hogwarts.</p><p>Malphast fails to recognize the Harry Potter reference and asks Tyler what Hogwarts is. Tyler explains this to Malphast and is caught talking in class by Vashti. Tyler explains his actions by noting Malphast's lack of familiarity with the books. To help Malphast and to help Tyler avoid potential supernatural damage, she assigns Tyler a project - to introduce Malphast to what it meas to be a human child. Tyler initially balks at this suggestion, but when reminded that his last attempt at dealing with a supernatural assignment resulted in him losing a day and a half of his memory, he agrees to the project.</p><p>Following class we find Miss Kyle and Vashti discussing her assignment for Tyler. They both come to an agreement that this assignment is a good idea for both Tyler and Malphast. Meanwhile, Malphast and Tyler prepare to go above-ground for lunch and recess. Malphast alters his form to look like a normal human child without the need of a hologram. When Tyler asks him if there is anything else he can do, Malphast explains that he does not know as he is the first offspring of an agent of Chaos and an agent of Order. Tyler takes this in stride and offers to let Malphast listen to some Weird Al on his CD player, noting that he and Cecil have been trading CDs back and forth. Malphast enjoys the music but lets his guard down and inadvertantly summons a creature in the locker-vator. The pair escape into the hallways of Excelsior Middle School before the monster can do them any harm. While recovering in the hallway, they run into Cecil, who is taken aback by what he sees. Cecil notes that he thinks Malphast is an alien and is surprised by Tyler hanging around with one of \"them\". Tyler explains his actions by telling Cecil that Malphast is a double-agent, which Cecil buys. Cecil then makes friends with Malphast and begins asking him about his planet's ruling class as they make their way to the cafeteria.</p><p>Once at the cafeteria, Cecil introduces Malphast to a trading card game (specifically, Magic: The Gathering, but it isn't mentioned by name.) Malphast uses the cards to do the equivalent of a tarot reading, divining that it will likely rain tomorrow. As Tyler tries to direct the conversation to a different topic, they are interrupted by Charles Brigman, who threatens Malphast and warns him that hanging around with Tyler and Cecil could be bad for his health. As Charles walks away, Cecil voices his concern that Charles is also an alien and that they're on to Cecil and Tyler's observations. As Tyler and Cecil discuss this, Charles trips and lands face-first in someone else's lunch tray. Malphast had his cloak knot Charles's shoelaces together as he was walking away. The three of them adjourn to the playground before anything else happens.</p><p>Once outside, Cecil and Tyler introduce Malphast to super-hero comic books. Malphast notes that there are many morality lessons to be learned, such as the strong defending the weak, but also notes that the antagonists are seldom permanently defeated. As they further discuss this, Charles jumps Tyler and prepares to beat him up. Malphast has Cecil hold his trench-coat open wide so that no one will see him use his powers. Charles swings at Tyler twice, his fists impacting but doing no damage to Tyler. As Charles crumples over in pain, Tyler notices Malphast extending his cloak to act as a shield over Tyler, but this act is very draining on Malphast. Once Malphast drops the shield, he recovers very quickly. Tyler thanks him for helping and is worried that someone from PS238 will notice. Malphast notes that nothing he did could be detected, but like the villains in comic books, Charles will likely return to cause problems. The three leave Charles to nurse his wounds and go explore the play equipment. The novelty of this quickly wears off and Tyler suggests they see if Suzi wants to play Four-Square. Tyler talks Cecil into going along with it and they go talk to Suzi.</p><p>Introductions are made, the rules of Four-Square are explained to Malphast, and they begin to play an easy game. After a few passes, Tyler makes a fault and they have to change the order. A few of the other meta-children want to join in on the game, and the foursome are agreeable to this. Unfortunately, their ball rolled off and ended up in the hands of... Charles. Charles taunts the group and when they demand their ball back he bounces it hard into Suzi's chest, knocking her off her feet. This does not sit well with Malphast, who, in a fit of anger, teleports the entire group into a different dimension. Malphast challenges Charles to a game of Four-Square. The loser of this match will be given over to the lords of the realm to do with as they please. At that moment, the incarnations of Chaos and Order appear, to preside over the challenge.</p><p>The match ensues and the players take their points on the square. Charles proceeds to knock Tyler out of the King position with a Sky-High serve, which wasn't explicitly forbidden at the beginning of service. As Emerald Gauntlet prepares to take up Tyler's spot on the field, he suggests to Suzi that on the next service they call to allow superpowers. He figures since they're not in the schoolyard, they can use their abilities. Suzi calls this during the service and the children use their abilities, but still can't knock Charles off the field. Charles manages to bump Suzi out, taking up the Ace position, allowing him to call the rules of service. On his next serve, he disallows superpowers, and then calls war on Malphast, leaving it set as a one-on-one match. After multiple volleys Malphast manages to knock a serve over Charles's head. Charles teleports back to where the ball would land and serves it back to Malpahst. The Lord of Order calls an end to the game due to Charles violating the rules. All of the children, including Charles are confused by this, because no one knew that Charles had super powers - not even Charles! The lords teleport the rest of the children back to Earth, warning Malphast against future invocations of challenge lest he draw the attention of other members of the factions. The lords then debate of the spoils of the contest. The end results of the spoils are that all the children are teleported back to Earth, with only Tyler and Malphast remembering what has happened that day.</p><p>As the children reappear from the exact moment they were taken, Miss Kyle comes over. She saw what Charles did to Suzi with the basketball and is giving him a week's detention. As Miss Kyle marches off with Charles, the children make plans to play Four-Square the next day and Cecil offers to have the group come over to his house and play video games if his mom is ok with it. Malphast and Tyler discuss the events that transpired and the fact that no one else seems to remember it. As they head in to the school from recess, Tyler notes that Malphast gets to tell Ms. Imperia about the thing in the elevator. Our story ends with the lords of order and chaos hovering over the small chunk of rock in the other dimension. They are trying to teach their charges, various creatures from the dimension, how to play Four-Square, but fear they may need to bring Suzi back to help explain the rules.</p><h4>Back-Up Story</h4><p>Baseball! America's favorite past time! And with the help of Herschel and Dr. Newby, the kids of PS238 can now participate in the game. Using Doctor Positron's files on each of the children, they have divided them into evenly-matched teams, and Herschel has protected the stands and the field with force-fields and holo-projectors, respectively, to protect the people in the stands and prevent unwanted viewing of the game. Principal Cranston congratulates them on their achievement and moves over to talk to Tyler, who is helping Ms. Kyle call the game. Tyler explains to the principal that he doesn't feel left out because he feels a lot safer in the stands behind the force fields.</p><p>Ron is at bat, and with a whiffed swing he finds himself behind two strikes. On the next pitch he clobbers the ball, tearing the cover off and launching it skyward. Tyler checks the sensors on his laptop which shows that Ron rounded the bases in under five seconds, but he is out. Principal Cranston questions this, to which Tyler explains that the ball landed in Lake Erie and hitting the ball into any major body of water is a ground-rule out. Had the ball reached Canada, it would have been a ground-rule double. Herschel notes to Principal Cranston that they've got satellites that can track a baseball, to which Ms. Kyle responds that he's probably more impressed by Canadian moose having to worry about incoming baseballs.</p>",
