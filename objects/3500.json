The first flaw is that induces a brief but powerful high that quickly deteriorates, leaving users in an uncontrollable rage. The second is that after enough doses, S-Tar will cause massive internal hemorrhaging, killing users almost instantly.

When she uses the substance, the size increase in minimal. Unlike other users, who grow several times their size, Natasha only grow to be about the size of a physically fit adult woman.

To counter the Central Avenue Sharks using Toastmasters, the East Streeters use Tar to level the playing field. John tried to fight off a Tar-Freak, but is knocked out. As he began his crusade againts the use of Tar and Toasmaster as Steel, he encountered many Tar-Freaks, but he manages to defeat them, or hold them off until the effects wear off. His nephew Jehmal, being in a gang, used S-Tar to attack his leader when he discovers that he was using the gang to target his family. He manages to best his leader, but Steel stops him from finishing the fight. Once Steel takes down Amertek, the gangs use of Tar is no longer mentioned.</p><p>However, John's nephew Jehmal hid a small stash of Tar for emergencies. When Steel is caught in an intense battle with the team <a href=\"/black-ops/4060-57871/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57871\">Black Ops</a>, he tries to take a vial, but Natasha Irons shows up, and takes the tar before he can. She uses the effects to help Steel defeat black Ops. Later, when Steel is attacked by a demonic looking version of his armor, Natasha takes tar again to help. While that was the last time she used the substance, the effects on her lingered. After the death of her grandmother, Natasha spends time at her grave. When John flies in to talk to her, she grows in size and attacks him in a fit of rage. John manages to restrain her until the Tar is fully burned out of her system. Later, blind gravekeeper who communicates with the dead tells her that Bess waned her to stop using Tar, she promises to stay off the substance. After the two leave D.C., no one is seen using Tar again.</p>",

The gun emits a stream of antimatter that disintegrates anything it comes into contact with, be it animate or inanimate. As a precaution against misuse, John has two fail-safes. One is a removable computer chip that contains the programming needed for the weapon to work. Without it, it cannot fire. The second is a self destruct mechanism that, when triggered, causes the gun to generate a small antimatter blast that disintegrates the weapon and anything within a short range.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Back when <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/steel/4005-2031/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2031\">John Henry Irons</a> worked for <a href=\"/amertek-industries/4060-61171/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61171\">AmerTek Industries</a>, created many powerful and dangerous devices. The most powerful of those devices was the Annihilator. When John realized that his weapons were being used to harm the innocent, he quit Amertek and destroyed his designs. However, when he created this weapon, he told no one about its existence, not even his friends at Amertek. Knowing the Annihilator was too powerful for anyone to wield but recognizing that a day could come when such power would be needed, he hid it in his old lab. As an added precaution, he removed the computer chip needed for it to work in case anyone found it. He left it buried there and hoped he would never have to use it.</p><p>However, when his battle with the techno-pirate group <a href=\"/black-ops/4060-57871/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57871\">Black Ops</a> escalated to its climax, John decided to unearth his old weapon to use it against them. However, both they and the FBI (John was a fugitive after being suspected of blowing up the Washington Monument) tracked him to his old lab and attacked before he could get the Annihilator out. In response, he decided to hide the weapon again and flee. When Black Ops kidnapped <a href=\"/natasha-irons/4005-10019/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10019\">Natasha</a> to try to get Steel to surrender, he decided to put the Annihilator into action. After reinstalling the programming chip, he teleports to <a href=\"/hazard/4005-71872/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71872\">Hazard's</a> base and gives them a chance to surrender. When they refuse and the fighting starts, Steel refrains from using the annihilator. But when he and Natasha are backed into a corner, he begins firing the Annihilator to destroy the base. When the fight heads outside, Steel accidentally kills three young Black Ops members when an attack throws his aim off. After that, he manages to finish them off without the Annihilator. Guilty over the three dead youths and worried that the Annihilator would find the wrong hands. Steel activates the self-destruct mechanism and leaves it inside Hazard's base, destroying it and most of the base.</p>",

The good Professor created two of these special wardrobes for personal usage, one was a prototype given to <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/deathstroke/4005-3588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3588\">Slade Wilson</a> who initially never bothered to apply it, while the other he saved for himself eventually perfecting his design.</p><p>How the Ikon suit works is that it is a powered gravity sheathe which functions via kinetic energy generated from the users own physical motion &amp; reactions, as well as opposing force directed against it and the wearer. Creating whats called a gravity tidal effect which loses its protective efficiency when covering a wider area circumference, but receiving an impact from objects as small as bullets reaching to the size fists it's barrier defense is all but impenetrable.</p><p>Said munitions robe can discharge the oncoming kinetic assault of individuals of extraordinary strength back at its attackers with nearly several times the force received. The costumes also come with an automated A.I. support system with which it can actively interface with technically advanced environs.</p><p>In order to assist the wearer in its endeavors, the intelligence monitors user and suit integrity while regulating system parameters as the user makes its journey. The more advanced Icon Suit affords even greater capability than its predecessor, the newer version's A.I. has greater processing power than the old and is capable of remotely shutting down it's earlier model. The suit grants it's user superhuman strength and resilience enabling them to pick up and chuck automobiles bare handed, by overclocking the suits gravitational capabilities handlers can attain self-propelled flight. </p>",
