It was created by the botanists of the planet.  </p> <p>The plant demonstrates preternatural instinct and limited locomotion witch permit it to create the symbiotic bond with his users. The Belamort feeds off its host, absorbing nutrients while it provides an unique chemical that stimulates the brain’s pleasure centers of his host. So the host is indulged in whatever fantasy world he envisioned. With the time, most of the Kahloan develops an extreme bond with their Belamort who place them in a perpetual state of sedation. Some thinks that the plant is more a parasite than a symbiot but Kahloan philosophers consider that the relationship is mutually beneficial.  </p> <p>In the pleasure centers of Kahlo, the uses of Belamort for off-worlders are limited to a few hours out of every day. The exportation of the plant or of the narcotic is strictly prohibited but smugglers always try to steal it in order sell them a lot of money.  </p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><h3>Earth-616</h3><p>The Death Seed was an artifact of great cosmic power that was created by the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a>. Its origins were traced to the early history of the universe when the cosmos was created. At the time, the Celestials began experimenting with creating a servant to their will which led to the rise of the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/exterminators/4060-59718/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59718\">Exterminators</a>. These creatures, however, turned against their creators leading to their banishment in a self-contained universe to serve as their prison. Despite the failure, the Celestials once again made use of the power to forge the Death Seed to serve as a tool for evolution. Once imparted on a host, they gave their user a power that rivalled the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a> in its transformative potential. These cosmic relics were provided by the Celestial Gardeners to select Evolutionary Caretakers to serve the cause of guiding the evolution of a new species. At some point, the ancient Mutant known as <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse</a> who was charged with guiding the evolution of his species as dictated by the Celestials will. During each incarnation of his <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/horsemen-of-apocalypse/4060-40423/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40423\">Horsemen of Apocalypse</a>, he selected an individual to take the role of Death with these being a host to the Death Seed. This not only empowered its user but also provided an heir should the reign of Apocalypse ever come to an end. Among those <a href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Archangel</a> who was deeply affected by the experience as a Horseman of Apocalypse.</p><p>When Apocalypse was killed by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/fantomex/4005-4281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4281\">Fantomex</a>, the Death Seed within Warren Worthington III activated leading to him being transformed into the new Evolutionary Caretaker of the Mutant race. A group of Horsemen selected by Apocalypse in ages past served him in this time with one among them being <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/death/4005-74590/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74590\">Sanjar Javeed</a> who acted as Death. He would be killed by Wolverine's X-Force leading to Archangel going before the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/dreaming-celestial/4005-22836/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\">Dreaming Celestial</a> to request a new Death Seed which he intended to place within <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a> to transform her into the new Death. However, the <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/age-of-apocalypse/4015-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56051\">Age of Apocalypse</a> reality managed to purge the Seed from Braddock's body. In the aftermath, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/holocaust/4005-15071/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15071\">Genocide</a> who was the son of En Sabah Nur intended to claim his heritage by becoming the new Evolutionary Caretaker. To that end, he called forth a Celestial Gardener in order to be provided the Death Seed and cosmic armor. However, the Apocalypse Twins, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/uriel/4005-88224/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88224\">Uriel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/eimin/4005-88225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88225\">Eimin</a> who were the children of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/pestilence/4005-74592/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74592\">Pestilence</a> opposed him where they murdered the Celestial. This started an event that was believed to affect the entire Earth as a result.</p><h3>Age of Apocalypse</h3><p>Within the Age of Apocalypse, En Sabah Nur himself was slain leading to <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Weapon X</a> taking on the role of Evolutionary Caretaker in an effort to spare his world from the Celestials wrath. Thus, he restarted the campaigns of extermination perpetrated by Apocalypse against the human race after being corrupted by the Seed. The mainstream Earth's X-Force led by Wolverine had arrived on this world in the company of <a href=\"/dark-beast/4005-3422/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3422\">Dark Beast</a> in the hopes of finding a <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/life-seed/4055-56936/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56936\">Life Seed</a> in order to cure Archangel of corruption. This brought them into conflict with Weapon Omega who had acquired a Death Seed and intended to implant it within his love, Jean Grey but failed due to X-Force. Afterwards, individuals such as <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> managed to determine the power of the Apocalypse Force with them seeking to harness it. Von Doom managed to create a device capable of storing the Apocalypse Force from its host body and empowering it within a new user.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/x-terminated/4060-58744/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58744\">X-Terminated</a> were responsible for stealing the technology and killing Von Doom whereupon they employed the technology for use against Weapon Omega. Jean Grey was ultimately responsible for removing the power of the Apocalypse Seed within her former lover whereupon it was placed within a storage device. Whilst stored, their world was invaded by the Exterminators who were newly freed from their universal prison and intended to devour the entire multiverse. It was quickly learnt that the Apocalypse Force was an anathema to the creatures as their own energies were used in its functioning. To that end, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\">Prophet</a> had Jean Grey find the storage device and release the Death Seeds power in the hopes that her prior experience wielding the Phoenix Force would allow her to resist the corruptive power of the Apocalypse Force. Initially, Dark Beast stole the storage device and attempted to empower himself but failed. This allowed Jean Grey to free the energy and have its power within her which she used to battle the Exterminators whilst the Age of Apocalypse was sealed to serve as a prison for the cosmic predators.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Death Seed was created by Uncanny X-Force writer <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/rick-remender/4040-44849/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44849\">Rick Remender</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>==The New 52==</p><p>Around five years ago, the Tektite Solution was first developed at the government facility known as The Lab that was part of the military industrial complex where it was created under Director Mitch Shelley. The development of this biotech saw its first usage in Iraq, Basra where Shelley along with his assistant Hooker ruthlessly tested the substance on the dead and the dying. Despite the unorthodox nature of the field test, the Solution showed some promising results when Director Shelley suffered a terrible accident. An attack on his field base saw him losing his arm and being injected with the Tektites by an unknown attacker. Rescued by his security consultant, Deathstroke, Mitch Shelley was rushed to base where he ordered the Solution to be injected in all the wounded. Director Shelley's arm was later reattached whilst Hooker recovered though his wounds never healed and Hoffman along with Leno healed as well as developed enhanced abilities. At this point, Director Shelley's arm began to reject his body and it was discovered that the reason for this was because he was growing a new arm. As a result, the old arm was sent for incineration where it was destroyed but the Tektites within dispersed in the air where they culminated away and began stripping the area for raw material. The Solution thus began to follow its function of restoring its hosts genetic template and was responsible for growing a completely new Mitch Shelley as a result. The duplicate wandered the world as the Resurrection Man whilst the original Mitch Shelley began to slowly die as his body was failing him leaving him in a near crippled state. After learning of his duplicate, Director Shelley became obsessed with finding him in order to unlock the secrets of the Tektites.</p>",

In addition the Nightbird was bullet-proof and could be driven by remote control. After it's destruction, Nightwing was later seen driving a new and much more heroic-looking version of the Nightbird. While the original looked like a dark red 1970's muscle car, the new Nightbird is now a black-and-blue vehicle that heavily resembles the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\" href=\"/batmobile/4055-41463/\"> Batmobile</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Phoenix is the primary command vessel for the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47654\" href=\"/g-force/4060-47654/\" slug=\"g-force\">G-Force</a> Team under command of the International Science Organization (ISO) and for use by the G-Force Team during deployment.</p><p>The Phoenix has three Primary Modes: Standby Mode, United Phoenix Mode and Fiery Phoenix Mode. Most of the information on the ship is classified such as Length, Width, Height, Weight and Top Speed but the ship is known to possess TBS Nuclear Missiles, TBX Nuclear Missiles, The Fiery Phoenix Mode as an offensive weapon and a Limited Range EMP Pulse Blast.</p><p>The Phoenix acts as the Command Vessel for the G-Force Team and can combine with the other vehicles of the team, the G-1 Summit Plane of Mark, the G-2 Space Mobile of Jason, the G-3 Galacticycle of Princess, the G-4 Space Buggy of Keyop with the Phoenix being the final vehicle with the Call Sign of G-5. The Phoenix is piloted by Tiny.</p><p>The Phoenix is stored in the Neptune Research Complex underwater in a specialized hangar. The craft is capable of operating underwater and in normal flight even including the ability to operate in space. The underwater and space operations are handle by on board ship systems in order to protect the crew such as pressure control and gravitational control as needed. The ship has a variety of support systems on board including a fully stocked sick bay and various sensor stations located at different areas of the main cockpit/bridge.</p><p>The top of the ship has a “bubble” which is a high tempered glass dome with an elevator that allows the team to leave and enter the ship from the top as well as a lower external rescue hatch for emergency operations. Other support systems include fog lights, a ghost field cloaking device and full spectrum scanners.</p><p>The primary weapon of The Phoenix is the Bird Missiles. Located on the top of the ship in a retractable pod are missiles which can be fired through use of a launch button on the bridge. The rate of fire for the missiles are controlled by the gunner and can be launched as a single shot or in volleys up to the entire capacity of missile compliment. A secondary weapon for the ship is a solar-powered energy blaster though not often seen in use. As a plot device, the solar-powered energy blaster use is often attempted on cloudy days. The most powerful weapon of the ship is the Fiery Phoenix Mode described later in this article.</p><h2>MODES</h2><h3>Standby Mode</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033085-phoenix_f5_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2033085\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.69850746268657\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033085-phoenix_f5_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2033085\"><img alt=\"Phoenix without car or jet in bays\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033085-phoenix_f5_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033085-phoenix_f5_1.jpg 335w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-width=\"335\"></a><figcaption>Phoenix without car or jet in bays</figcaption></figure><p>The Standby Mode of the Phoenix is when all of the other team vehicles are not on board. In this mode, the ship is at its weakest and is configured with the wings canted slight down and the nose section of the ship retracted and showing a blunt nosed appearance. Least powerful in this mode, The Phoenix cannot use any of the on board weapons and can do little but fly around with limited maneuverability provided by the twin engines that supply thrust from the rear or that can be directed through two large VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing) ports on the underside of the ship. The combined thrust does little more than keep the ship horizontal and in motion until the other vehicles are able to be joined with the Command Ship. In this mode, the ship does not have a vertical tail fin as the G-1 Summit Jet forms the vertical tail fin when docked.</p><h3>United Phoenix Mode</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033086-phoenix_f5_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2033086\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033086-phoenix_f5_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2033086\"><img alt=\"Phoenix\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033086-phoenix_f5_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033086-phoenix_f5_2.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Phoenix</figcaption></figure><p>The United Phoenix Mode requires that all vehicles of the team be joined together in order for The Phoenix to perform at full capabilities. In order to do this, each pilot must maneuver their vehicle close to The Phoenix in order for Tiny to operate the controls to either lift the vehicle in place or, in the case of the G-1 Summit Jet, fly into the rear “hangar.”</p><p>Each vehicle has a designated section in which to dock and adds to the balance, ballast, of the main ship. In the United Phoenix Mode, the ship is at its most functional and is capable of great maneuverability and performance.</p><p>Located at port and starboard of The Phoenix are pods at the tips of the wings where the G-3 Galacticycle and the G-4 Space Buggy are stored. When in flight, the G-3 and G-4 can maneuver under the ship and be lifted in place by docking arms (G-4) or lowered ramp (G-3). Leading from the pods into the interior of the shift are pathways that Princess and Keyop can quickly access in order to move to the bridge.</p><p>The nose section of The Phoenix can retract and is where the G-2 Space Mobile is stored. Hovering or in slow flight, The Phoenix lowers lifting arms which lift the G-2 Space Mobile into place and secure it before the nose section slides into place concealing the Space Mobile. At that time, Jason can move from the Space Mobile into the ship proper and join the rest of the crew.</p><p>The rear or tail section of the ship houses the G-1 Summit Jet. During flight, the G-1 Summit Jet will maneuver behind The Phoenix and will dock by retracting the wings of the Summit and sliding into place to form the main vertical tail section of the Phoenix. Mark is then able to join the remainder of the crew through use of an access tunnel to the main bridge.</p><h3>Fiery Phoenix Mode</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033084-phoenix___fiery_phoenix.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2033084\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.37876386687797\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:37.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033084-phoenix___fiery_phoenix.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2033084\"><img alt=\"Fiery Phoenix\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55747/2033084-phoenix___fiery_phoenix.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033084-phoenix___fiery_phoenix.jpg 631w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55747/2033084-phoenix___fiery_phoenix.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fiery Phoenix\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55747/2033084-phoenix___fiery_phoenix.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2033084-phoenix___fiery_phoenix.jpg 631w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55747/2033084-phoenix___fiery_phoenix.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fiery Phoenix</figcaption></figure><p>By far the most powerful, and most dangerous, mode of The Phoenix is the Fiery Phoenix Mode. This mode of the ship is only considered as a “last ditch effort” due to the stresses placed on the ship and its crew. In the Fiery Phoenix Mode, the ship is nearly indestructible and it is questionable if Spectra has, or will, find a way to counter the ship in this mode or whether they can actually destroy The Fiery Phoenix.</p><p>In order to engage the ship in this mode, the outer hull of the ship is heated to extreme temperatures and heat and friction from the outside of the ship causes the ship to “burst into flames” and resembles a giant flaming bird, a Phoenix. At this time, the ship can literally fly through any adversary and destroy it, most commonly flying through the most vulnerable part of the ship. Due to the danger to the crew and the stresses to the ship, as well as the potential danger of flying too close to populated areas, this mode is the least used and is avoided unless no other option remains.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>The Phoenix can be seen in the Japanese Anime Science Ninja Team Gatchaman as well as in the English Dubbed Battle of the Planets of the late 70's and the television show, Eagle Riders of the 90's. The original Japanese title is Kagaku Ninjatai Gatchaman translated as Science Ninja Team Gatchaman.</p>",

His original shield has made appearances in retellings of his origins or earlier adventures and has been seen since.</p><p>It was destroyed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\" href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\">Baron Zemo</a> when the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\" href=\"/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\">Masters of Evil</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55966\" href=\"/avengers-under-siege/4045-55966/\">assault Avengers Mansion</a>, however, it has been seen since. Captain America used the shield when his main one was damaged in several books following Heroes Return and Rick Jones was later seen to own the shield in an issue of Captain Marvel. In Young Avengers, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2258\" href=\"/patriot/4005-2258/\">Patriot</a> stole the shield from Avengers Mansion but was later properly given it by Cap with his blessing. Oddly enough, despite all this, it was seen to still be broken during Civil War as the items Baron Zemo had destroyed during Under Siege were restored by Zemo with magic in a bid to convince Steve Rogers to help him. The shield was last seen still being used by Patriot.</p>",

    "deck": "Based on the alien technology of the X-O Manowar armor, the Armorines are the most advanced prototypes of combat units on Earth.",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58738\" href=\"/armorines/4060-58738/\" slug=\"armorines\">Armorines</a> Suits were the only positive result of \"Deep Freeze Project\", a failed attempt of the US goverment to eliminate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7135\" href=\"/x-o-manowar/4005-7135/\" slug=\"x-o-manowar\">Aric Dacia</a> and his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55973\" href=\"/x-o-armor-manowar-class/4055-55973/\" slug=\"x-o-armor-manowar-class\">X-O Armor</a>. Doctor Philip Zahn, the chief scientist of the project, was able to dig enough data from the X-O armor to retro-engineer many of its system using human technology.</p><p>Compared to their predecessor and other variants of the X-O techno-organic seeds - like the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55912\" href=\"/x-o-armor-wolf-class/4055-55912/\" slug=\"x-o-armor-wolf-class\">Wolf armor</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55974\" href=\"/x-o-armor-commando-class/4055-55974/\" slug=\"x-o-armor-commando-class\">Commando Armor</a> - the Armorines are rather unsophisticated designs.</p><p>The biggest difference is the lack of any form of on-board Artificial Intelligence. All the techno-organic X-O armors are sentient beings up to a point, which makes them capable of understanding the needs of the pilot and adapt to match them. The lack of this features forced the Armorines to rely on a system of co-pilots. Each unit on the field was linked up to a tactical operator - located at the base or in a transport close-by - that managed all the secondary systems and adapted the unit energy allocation according to the need of the moment. This link was one of the biggest weaknesses of the Armorines, if the radio link was somehow distrupted the soldier was forced to handle all the system by himself, vastly slowing down his reaction times.</p><p>Another element that Zahn was unable to replicate was the gravtic propulsion system used by the orginal X-O, while he later developed several mobility packs, at first the Armorines were strictly ground based units.</p><h2>Components</h2><p>Aiming to facilitate the suits construction, repair and modification, Zahn's team developed the armors as a set of individual components - some even capable of work indepedently from the main suit - instead of single fully integrated armor.</p><h4>Liner Suit</h4><p>The liner suit was a layer of circuitry that each soldier had to wear under the main armor in order fully utilize it. Without the liner suit the syncronization between the user movement and the armor movement was lost making it completly useless on the field.</p><h4><span>M.O.D.S. (Multi Optical Display System)</span></h4><p>The main feature of the helmets was this advanced image system. Basicly the system acquired datas from several different sensors scattered across the armor - including infrareds, light amplification, pressure gauge, chamical sensors etc. - then the information was fed to a computer back to base, which sent a digital image back to the soldier including all the relevant informations. While the visibility was greatly enhanced, this also allowed the mission control to \"edit out\" unwanted elements making the whole deal too similar to a videogame for some soldiers.</p><h4><span>Strength Enhancing Harness / Power Augumentation Layer</span></h4><p>Originally an integral part of the suit the Harness was soon modified to be used indepedently, although with a low duration battery. The harness generated an energy field meant to increase the soldier strength and speed, while proving a limited degree of protection from small arms fire and concussion damage.</p><h4>Protective Field</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24477/796339-protective_field_generator.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-796339\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.23462686567164\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:23.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24477/796339-protective_field_generator.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-796339\"><img alt=\"The second version of the Protective Field during a training exercise\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/24477/796339-protective_field_generator.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24477/796339-protective_field_generator.jpg 1675w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/24477/796339-protective_field_generator.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/24477/796339-protective_field_generator.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The second version of the Protective Field during a training exercise</figcaption></figure><p>A integral component of the main carapace, the protective field was actally a layer of gas permable located 0.01 inches beyond the armor surface, at the expenditure of additional energy the layer could be made solid for increased protection. Later doctor Zahn developed an external force field more similar to the one used by the original X-O, but it was never field tested.</p><h4>Photo-Reactive Camouflage</h4><p>While the suits first prototypes were all bare metal the first field units were equiped with an advanced camouflage system. The surface of the suit reacted to the surrounding light growing darker in low light conditions or viceversa. Pretty mcuh it constantly changed to match the situation and the environement. a later version also have the added ability to match the environment most common colors, eliminating the need for chemical alteration of the pattern before each mission.</p><h4>Trauma Kit</h4><p>Each suit was equiped with a full first aid kit - including antibiotics, painkillers and other drugs - these were preloaded in autoinjector that could be also activated by another soldier from an outside panel. The suit also acted as a clamp, automaticly blocking any blood loss from the soldier inside.</p><h4>Ejection and Self-Destruct</h4><p>Given the experimental and highly classified nature of the project each suit was outfitted with a self-destruct device. Once activated the armor section separated and the pilot was ejected, after a few second the unit powercore detonated.</p><h3>Weapon Systems</h3><p>The suit weapon system were a varied mix, while the basic technology was form the X-O armor later developments were actually Zahn's original ideas.</p><h4>20 MgHz Ion Cannons</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24477/794501-armorines_ion_cannon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794501\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.86367880485528\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24477/794501-armorines_ion_cannon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794501\"><img alt=\"Ion Cannon\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24477/794501-armorines_ion_cannon.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24477/794501-armorines_ion_cannon.jpg 1071w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/24477/794501-armorines_ion_cannon.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/24477/794501-armorines_ion_cannon.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24477/794501-armorines_ion_cannon.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Ion Cannon</figcaption></figure><p>The suit main weapon system was a double barrel ion cannon mounted on the left gauntlet. While its power was mininal compared to the 60 MgHz cannons used by original X-O, the weapon was still more powerful than many conventional firearms. The cannon was energized by a separate system respect to the rest of the suit, which allowed it to be used as an individual weapon.

The used capacitators were expelled like spent shells.</p><h4>Ion-Charged Blade</h4><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738536\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738536\"><img alt=\"Ion Blade\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg 800w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ion Blade\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg 800w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/738536-800px_armorinesion.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ion Blade</figcaption></figure><p>A close combat weapon, the Ion Blade was stored inside the right gauntlet.

Unfortunatly the energy expenditure require was very high and it couldn't be fire more than once every few minute to avoid a general circuit meltdown. At first the energy feeding was handled by the operators back to base, later a automated shut-down function was added.</p><h4>Laser Cutter</h4><p>Mounted on the helmet the laser cutter was meant to be a proper weapon, but the short range and limited power, compared to the ion cannons, reduced his usefulness. It was soon rebuilt as a tool, but it was still useful for close combat against oppoenents without a power armor.</p><h3>Combat Attachments</h3><p>To increase the units functionality doctor Zahn developed various combat attachments to supplement the basic functions. This took form of small attachments mounted on the gauntlets of the unit.</p><h4>Harpoon</h4><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738535-309px_armorinesharpoon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738535\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9385113268608\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:193.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738535-309px_armorinesharpoon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738535\"><img alt=\"Harpoon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" data-width=\"309\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738535-309px_armorinesharpoon.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738535-309px_armorinesharpoon.jpg 309w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Harpoon\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738535-309px_armorinesharpoon.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738535-309px_armorinesharpoon.jpg 309w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" data-width=\"309\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Harpoon</figcaption></figure><p>An apparently simple device, the harpoon was one of the most versatile combat attachments. Beside its basic function of enhancing the unti mobility, the tips of the weapon were ion-charged making it capable of piercing almost any material and making it useful as a short range weapon for stealth assassination.</p><h4>Sonic Cannon</h4><p>Developed for electronic warfare, the sonic cannon fired a modular ultrasonic pulse meant to scramble enemy sensors and distrupt circuitry.</p><h4>Bolos Launcher</h4><p>A hybrid weapon the bolos laucher fired a bolos-like projectile to entagle the enemy. The projectile was ion charged making it extremly resistant and able to stun unarmoered targets.</p><h4>Ion-Charged Axe</h4><p>A replacement for the standard Ion Blade, the Ion Axe, fully replaced the unit right gauntlet. While it packed more power the weapon was also more unwieldly. Excpet for James Earl Williams no member of the unit used this attachment.</p><h3>Mobility Packs</h3><p>For a time mobility was the main Achille's heel of the Armorines. While the armors made them faster than a normal human soldier, they were still striclty ground based. To correct this problem Zahn's team developed tow different mobility backpacks.</p><h4>Aerial / Rocket Pack</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738537\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87719298245614\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738537\"><img alt=\"Death From Above\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg 684w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death From Above\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg 684w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/738537-684px_armorinesjet_pack.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death From Above</figcaption></figure><p>Developed for aerial combat this pack allowed the Armorines to operated from the skies. Unfortunatly the limietd fuel supply made it useless for any prolonged combat situation. As a consequence the rocket pack was used more often for insertion at the beginning of a mission, to this end the packs contained a small explosive charge to self-destruct, to prevent identification.</p><h4>Underwater Pack</h4><p>Due to their sheer bulk the Armorines units were pretty dead weight underwater, the underwater pack was meant to compensate proving the unit with buoyancy and propel the unit while underwater. Unfortunatly the water refraction also interfered with the energy output of the ion-based weapons, reducing their efficiency to 60% or even less depending on the depth.</p>",

She employed skates which created their own ice and allowed her to skate on any surface and even through mid-air. The original design for the skates was invented by Lisa's brother Leonard, otherwise known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2392\" href=\"/captain-cold/4005-2392/\" slug=\"captain-cold\">Captain Cold</a>.

    "deck": "777 Tools that demons use for a variety of purposes. Neuro Nougami uses a few of these in his cases to find the \"Ultimate Mystery.",
    "description": "<p>List of Tools</p><h4></h4><ul><li>Evil Ampule <span>- <span>A needle full of potion that Neuro claims doubles the revolution speed of the neural transmitters in the user's brain, making them more intelligent</span>.</span></li></ul><ul><li><b>Evil Badger</b> - An insect with an unbalanced diet, it replaces the target's tongue and feeds on the victim's most disliked foods. The victim's breathing will stop if the insect ceases eating before it's done. Neuro explains different Evil Badgers have different tastes.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Evil Blind</b> - Neuro engulfs himself and anyone else of his choice in an aura. This allows Neuro and Co. within a 10 meter radius to shift into a \"lower resolution\" of existence. Though used for investigations, this tool was used by other demons for killing, as indicated by Neuro.</li><li><b>Evil Butterfly</b> - A strange little butterfly with human ears for wings which function as a hidden microphone. This is paired with a set of earphones shaped like a human face where the speakers are on the mouth. While this tool seems normal at first, the user actually risks having their head pierced though by the speaker which extends out like a drill when the face sneezes.</li><li><b>Evil Canceller</b> - Neuro regurgitates a liquid (similar to vomit). Anyone it gets on becomes invisible. Though the wearer cannot be seen they may still be heard.</li><li><b>Evil Carpenter</b> - A giant demonic construction worker with several man-sized workers sprouting from its spine. Neuro uses this tool along with Evil Mud to reconstruct the collapsed places in certain parts of the city during his battle with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81258\" href=\"/dr/4005-81258/\">DR</a>.</li><li><b>Evil Centipede</b> - A tool that looks like a gigantic centipede made out of shoes. It is used to show how many times a person has stepped in a certain area by replacing their footsteps. The more they have stepped in the area, the darker the footsteps become. It appears normal people cannot physically see the effects of the tool, as Neuro had to put his hand over Yako's eyes for her to notice the footsteps.</li><li><b>Evil Chainsaw</b> - Neuro's hand metamorphosizes into a miniature chainsaw to cut things, strange enough the tool is actually powered by a small creature running on a hamster wheel on the tip of the blade.</li><li><b>Evil Cocoon</b> - A tool Neuro uses on Yako to give her a \"different aura\" around people. What Neuro tells Yako is a lie. It's actually an illusion tool to make it appear as though the user is a grotesque monster-like figure.</li><li><b>Evil Comedy</b> - Neuro sends a hell bug to land on a person's face where it becomes a pair of demonic glasses that drill into the person's head making them think they are trapped on a giant spider web covered with bugs. While this is happening the glasses are invisible to everyone except Neuro and the victim who while in the illusion laughs uncontrollably.</li><li><b>Evil Drop</b> - An eye drop that allows the user to shoot \"Hell Beams\" from their eyes that can even destroy a building. This tool was only explained and never used so it isn't known if it's power is true or if Neuro was lying about it. In the anime, this too wasn't even fully explained, it's effects only implied. Evil Drop was mentioned during the Histerrier case, and it is one of Neuro's attacks in <i>Jump Ultimate Stars</i>.</li><li><b>Evil Diversary</b> - A Demon World battery filled with Neuro’s demonic power.</li><li><b>Evil Fiction</b> - An insectoid accessory which is attached to the ear like an earring to portray someone as a character. However this only works for thirty minutes before the tool itself starts gnawing on the ear, crawling into the host to feast on their organs.</li><li><b>Evil Friday</b> - Neuro reveals his demon-form face and spits out a large sphere made of eyeballs. The eyeballs detach and become sentient lifeforms. The eyes function like cameras and serve as extra eyes for Neuro.</li><li><b>Evil Full Face</b> - Neuro sends out a demon head from his hair that acts as a smoke screen bomb to allow for quick escapes.</li><li><b>Evil Fumble</b> - A bottle of potion that is supposed to be an even stronger version of Evil Ampule. Neuro used this to try to make Yako's classes harder by boosting her teachers' brainpower, but instead it hospitalized them</li><li><b>Evil Gauntlet</b> - A pair of hands surface from the earth that will grab a person's legs rendering him uncapable to move.</li><li><b>Evil Illusion</b> - Neuro uses a demonic umbrella to seal himself and his victim off from the rest of the world in another space so he can change and eat their \"mystery\" while projecting the illusion to anyone watching that nothing strange is happening.</li><li><b>Evil Insole</b> - A creature like a shoe's insole that climbs into the interior bottom of a person's shoe and analyzes all the substance that is present in the shoe, right down to the DNA.</li><li><b>Evil Javelin</b> - Neuro turns his arm into a halberd-like weapon and uses it to cut. In the Human World, Evil Javelin cannot cut or slice, instead it gathers the information and the contents of the objects it goes through.</li><li><b>Evil Lavender</b> - Neuro's hand becomes something that resembles a purple drill, and is used to stab through objects. Once it has punctured the target, it will bloom into lavender flowers; upon closer inspection, the \"flowers\" are really small, demonic hands curved into the flower shape.</li><li><b>Evil Low Beam</b> - Neuro creates small lenses on his fingertips which when looked into will burn an image into the victim's retinas so that whenever they open their eyes they will see it.</li><li><b>Evil Pressure</b> - Out of Neuro's nape comes out a machine that sends a demonic electrical current that tears apart muscle and tendons.</li><li><b>Evil Rapid</b> - A tool that is a demonic conceptualization of a steam train, it can reach mach speed in one second, with the G-forces tearing up a human body in the process.</li><li><b>Evil Reflector</b> - A microphone-like device when activated opens a women's head within a mirror shell, then hexagonal mirror discs begin floating all around Neuro. Anything that flies towards the discs will be reflected back in the opposite direction with same force and same speed.</li><li><b>Evil Script</b> - Neuro removes his glove and his hand becomes cybernetic. He can use this cybernetic hand to reach into objects like computers and retrieve information physically by grasping it.</li><li><b>Evil Shooter</b> - A spring-like rope resembling a spinal cord covered with skulls. Neuro uses the tool like a slingshot to send Yako away during the first part of his battle with Sicks and XI.</li><li><b>Evil Stalker</b> - An insect that Neuro uses to keep track of people; functions as a tracking device. Neuro keeps one on Yako and Godai to track their movements.</li><li><b>Evil Station</b> - Not really a tool but more a game system from the underworld that projects \"solid images\" (you can feel them but they are really not there) making the game 3D for the player. If turned off too quickly, some residual images may remain. Neuro demonstrates a dating-sim game using this tool, though it produced holograms of tortured monsters (the Demon World's version of dating-sims).</li><li><b>Evil Sticker</b> - A small sticker that is placed on a fingertip; the closer the user is to their objective the stronger the finger will stick up. Neuro placed it on Yako's middle finger when she went looking for Godai, causing her to unintentionally give Godai the finger when she finally found him<b>.</b></li><li><b>Evil Stole</b> - Neuro takes off his blue suit coat and puts on a black jacket. The longer he stays without moving, the more energy he regains by scraping together and absorbing bits of demonic power in the air. Used for 'life or death' situations.</li><li><b>Evil Stringer</b> - A figure with a drill on the bottom that punches a hole into the head of a victim. It is then transformed into a \"Bat\" with a thin bass without strings, so instead it uses the nerves that drilled out from the victims head to play. Once tightly stung, with its wings the bat then plays screechy music directly into the victims head. This process of torture however, cannot be seen by bystanders.</li><li><b>Evil Surfacer</b> - One of Neuro's odder tools, it takes the form of a small robot-like creature with a jetpack and a bottle in its mouth. Neuro does not mention its ability, but it is implied the tool coats the intended target with a shiny surface and prevents the target from being destroyed.</li><li><b>Evil Surronder</b> - A capsule ball which breaks into little seeds. When the seeds attach to a surface, a plant from hell that feeds on metal will grow instantly to protect its territory.</li><li><b>Evil Taster</b> - A demonic tongue-cover that switches the wearer's taste around, making sour foods taste sweet, bitter foods taste spicy, and vice-versa. Neuro uses this to punish Yako when she planned to enjoy herself at a restaurant while he was starving for mysteries.</li><li><b>Evil Time Machine</b> - A demonic tongue-cover that switches the wearer's taste around, making sour foods taste sweet, bitter foods taste spicy, and vice-versa. Neuro uses this to punish Yako when she planned to enjoy herself at a restaurant while he was starving for mysteries.</li><li><b>Evil Torture</b> - A weapon that resembles a set of wings that attach to Neuro’s back. It consists of two pairs of wings. The first pair serves to prevent the opponent from attacking and the second pair penetrates and tears the opponent's flesh from within, though it will not harm the vital organs. Evil Torture senses what the user (Neuro) wants to do most, and acts accordingly. Neuro states Evil Torture is one of his favorite tools.</li><li><b>Evil Window</b> - Neuro summons a demonic window in the sky that when opened will release a beast from hell</li></ul>",

    "description": "<ul><li><b>Evil Aqua</b> - he first of the 7 Weapons of the Demon Emperor used. Neuro summons 7 fish-like cannons, 6 which are smaller support cannons, and blasts a huge laser onto the target. Neuro notes that the power of Evil Aqua is considerably weaker in the human world than the demon world. Neuro transforms into his demon form when using this move, sporting his demon face and wing-like arms.</li><li><b>Evil Flyer</b> - Neuro uses this to fly over to Sicks' fighter jet after Sicks attempts to flee. Despite Neuro's depleting demonic energy at that time, it was able to last long enough to get him to the designated location.</li><li><b>Evil Metal</b> - First used during Neuro and Sicks' final battle. It is a blade that does not have a process which creates cuts, but produces the cut itself, making it virtually unblockable, as there is nothing to block. It is Neuro's strongest attack that he claims it can even kill the Demon Emperor.</li><li><b>Evil Mud</b> - Neuro summons a giant cyclops-like creature. Evil Mud has a star-shaped symbol at the bottom portion of its body. Neuro describes it as a tenacious golem with enough power to destroy a city. Evil Mud can be broken down to smaller pieces when used with Evil Carpenter. Neuro does this in his fight with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81258\" href=\"/dr/4005-81258/\" slug=\"dr\">DR</a> to seal the holes DR made on the dams. During Valentines day, Yako's chocolate was secretly mixed with some of the Demon World mud which can give a nourishment boost and comically enhances a body with physical strength for a period of time.</li><li><b>Evil Tree</b> - Neuro summons a giant plant that travels underground and emerges under a specified location. It is seen with a large green bud in the center with about 12-13 long monstrous heads emerging from the base of the plant. The tree can be used to attack and support.</li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Shortly after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\">Batman</a> captures the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\" href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\">Joker</a> once again, sending him to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\" href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\">Arkham Asylum</a>, Joker is met by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-79860\" href=\"/dollmaker/4005-79860/\">Dollmaker</a> in his cell. Joker seemed to have been expecting him, allowing the Dollmaker to slice off his face, then helping him escape from the asylum, leaving the face behind as a sign that he is once again changing. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42090\" href=\"/gotham-city-police-department/4060-42090/\">GCPD</a> take the face, and store it in their building, but with no sign from the Joker, who has presumably gone into hiding, his followers start constructing monuments to him outside the GCPD building in a bizarre ritualistic fashion.</p><p>Later, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1696\" href=\"/harley-quinn/4005-1696/\">Harley Quinn</a> breaks out of jail and heads for Gotham where she intends to find Joker's remains. She manages to get hold of the face and places it on her former <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40394\" href=\"/suicide-squad/4060-40394/\">Suicide Squad</a> teammate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5763\" href=\"/deadshot/4005-5763/\">Deadshot</a> in a bizarre ritual. She speaks to Deadshot as if he is the Joker, a game which he plays along with to distract her long enough so he can shoot her, thus completing his mission.</p><p>Then, in the GCPD evidence room, Harvey Bullock tells a new rookie cop a creepy story about one of Joker's cop-kills. He then leaves her to stay in the room at night with the recovered face, as it's her job. Late at night, the face begins to laugh eerily. At first, the rookie thinks she is just imagining things, but it laughs louder and she decides to take it out of the case to reassure herself. At that moment, it laughs loudly, and she throws it in fear, but then realizes an audio player is taped to the back of it. It was all, in fact, a prank by Bullock to initiate her into the police force.</p><p>Across the street, in an abandoned building, a figure looks over the GCPD building from the shadows and says to himself, \"Time to put on a happy face!\"</p>",

They commonly use these masks to see in infrared when hunting, but the masks come with a multitude of other vision modes, act as a breathing apparatus, provide diagnostics, and carry many more functions. Predators usually customize these masks in various ways, in order to show-case their reputation and status to other Predators.",

It protects a Predator's head with its armored plating, but also lets the user access different visual spectrums to see through, it can act as binoculars with its telescopic vision, it provides diagnostics, it can record audio and visuals, and also includes a breathing apparatus. The mask also is often used in conjunction with a Predator's <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/plasma-caster/4055-56382/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56382\">Plasma Caster</a> by providing its targeting laser and showing the user when lock-on has been achieved.</p><p>The mask is also linked to a Predator's Wrist Gauntlet, which controls many of the mask's functions.
