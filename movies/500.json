    "description": "<p>Â  Reporter Jane Arden is convinced that  debutante Martha Blanton has a story to tell, and her instinct is proven  correct when Martha is killed. Jane is also sure that the man the  police arrest is not the man who killed Martha.  Ed Towers, the  newspaper's editor, fires Jane for incompetence and then meets secretly  with her.  He hands her an undercover assignment, introducing her to  Bill Clifton, a special investigator for the Jewelers Association.  Bill  explains that Martha was involved in a jewel smuggling ring and was  killed when she tried to leave.  They suspect the reputable firm of  Thayer and Co. of being the ringleader, but have been unable to find any  proof of wrongdoing.  Jane's first act is to try and sell Thayer and  Co. some stolen jewels, using a false name, just as Albert Thayer and  Dr. George Vanders are looking for another woman to take Martha's place  in the gang.  Vanders is impressed by Jane, but Thayer is suspicious.   Jane agrees to smuggle in some jewels from Bermuda, but on board the  ship, Thayer sees Ed leaving Jane's cabin and has him followed.   Learning that he is a newspaperman, Thayer cables Vanders with the news,  but Vanders decides to go through with their plans and intends to kill  Jane after the jewels are successfully brought into the country. Jane  meets Vanders and his accomplice, Lola Martin, on the ship but does not  realize that they are involved in the gang. Meanwhile, Thayer kidnaps Ed  and holds him hostage. In Bermuda, Lola becomes jealous of Vanders'  attentions to Jane and refuses to steal the jewels. Vanders walks in on  Jane while she is phoning Bill with the latest plans, but he warns her  that Ed is in danger if she does anything to jeopardize the robbery.   When they arrive at the party, however, they discover that the jewels  have already been stolen. Vanders then realizes that Lola committed the  robbery in order to have them all for herself.  Jane and Vanders wait  for Lola in her room, and when she arrives, Lola tells Vanders that his  identity is known and suggests that they escape together.  Unknown to  Vanders, Ed has escaped and tricked Thayer into a confession.  He flys  to Bermuda, where he sees Vanders and Lola leaving with Jane.  He chases  them and finally shoots Vanders.  On the boat returning home, Ed  reveals that he loves Jane and they kiss.</p>",

Jane &amp; Tarzan's first anniversary has arrived, and Jane is trying to find a suitable present for her husband, with the help of the elephant Tantor  and the gorilla Terk<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terk\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. When a party is suggested, they remember the disaster that occurred when three of Jane's friends arrive for a visit. As Jane considers a gift of jewellery, she is reminded of Tarzan's exploit with a pair of conniving diamond prospectors who take advantage of him and also trigger a volcanic reaction. Jane then decides on a night of dancing but changes her mind when she remembers how Bobby, one of her childhood friends, came to visit, only to be found out to be a treacherous spy to the Germans during World War I. Downhearted, Jane goes home without a present, only to find that Tarzan has put together a wonderful surprise for her. </p>",

    "description": "<p>The vampiress protagonist is played by Gloria Holden. Her main opponents are Dr. Jeffrey Garth, a psychiatrist, and his love interest Janet Blake. Notably they receive wittier banter and bigger roles than their 1931 versions of Harker and Murray. The cast also includes Sandor, a moody and imposing manservant of Marya. He is intelligent, genuinely protective of her and acts as her advisor. He is in love with his lady and kills her when she rejects his advances.</p><p>Marya Zaleska was the first second generation-vampire on screen. She was also the first female vampire not depicted as subservient to a male one. She is conflicted about her vampiric status and seeks a cure for her bloodlust. However she does stalk, seduce and drain victims regularly. Her interaction with female victims reportedly features lesbianic overtones. This is a standard for the depiction of female vampires in literature since \"Carmilla\" (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu but had not been seen in film before.</p>",

He is depicted as a stereotyped \"mad scientist\". His creature is brutal because the brain placed in him was defective.
