    "deck": "The small town near Camp Crystal Lake is sighing in relief as it has been five years without any incidents.....that is until a training camp for teenage camp councilors opens across the lake from the feared Camp \"Blood\" (Crystal Lake).",
    "description": "<p>The horrible past of <a href=\"/camp-crystal-lake/4020-56308/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56308\">Camp Crystal Lake </a>is all but forgotten. As the towns people attempt to forget the police force insure that no one enters the wretched Camp \"Blood\" (Crystal Lake). After the bloody disappearance of Alice, the young camp councilor that killed <a href=\"/mrs-voorhees/4005-55741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55741\">Mrs. Voorhees </a>and survived, five years pass and all is quite. Everything seems to be looking up........that is until Paul Holt decides to open a camp councilor training center at a camp across the lake from none other than Camp Crystal Lake. A mysterious figure begins to stalk the shadows of the young campers from the start and watches their every move. On the first day Mr. Holt and his assistant Ginny Field take the group to the lake so they can swim, or tan, or just have some fun in the sun before the work begins. When two young councilors (Sandra Dier and her boyfriend Jeff) decide to wonder off and check out the old camp. Upon arriving in the camp they find bloody remains of some sort of animal and just as they are about to leave the local sheriff's deputy (Deputy Winslow) appears and takes them back to the camp where they belong. Deputy Winslow informs Mr. Holt that he must keep all of the kids off of Camp Blood grounds, that it has been five quite years and they want to keep it that way. The deputy continues by saying that if he catches anymore of the kids over there he would arrest them. Nodding that he agrees as the deputy is walking out Mr. Holt says he will take care of it all.</p><p>While on his way back into town the deputy see's someone run across the road and head for Camp Crystal Lake. He immediately assumes that more of the kids from Mr. Holts group have decided to look into the old camp. Jumping from his car and giving chase he ends up outside a makeshift and rundown trailer. As he walks through the trailer he hears something outside and goes to check it out, but before he makes it out the door someone murders him with a blunt force to the head. While back at the center Mr. Holt informs the campers that the day was the last fun day tomorrow the work begins. He also tells them that he will take anyone who wants one last night on the town into town with the exception of their two explorers (Sandra and Jeff) who have volunteered to stay back and watch the camp along with a few others who actually volunteer. As the night drags on and most of the camp leaves for a night on the town the few who remained back attempt to find something fun to do......but someone is watching them all from the shadows.</p><p>One girl decides to go for a swim and after getting scared goes to get her clothes only to discover they have been taken. It is quickly revealed that another of the young men from the camp took them and she chases him where he is suddenly swept up into a tree thanks to a little trap. As the girl grabs her clothes and runs back to camp to get a knife to cut him down the mysterious figure appears and cuts the boys throat. Upon her return the girl believes the boy is only playing around then realizes that he is actually dead, the figure then kills her as well. Slowly the figure makes its way to camp and kills off the others who chose to stay back.</p><p>Soon after Mr. Holt and his assistant Ginny return to find the camp appearing to vacant. As they search they suddenly find that they are not alone when a man wearing a potato sack over his head leaps from the shadows and attempts to kill Mr. Holt. After a short fight the figure stands and after a horror filled scream Ginny runs with the man in fast pursuit. The somewhat lengthy chase ends inside a cabin on the grounds of Camp Crystal Lake where Ginny discovers the decapitated head of who can only assume was Mrs. Voorhees. Afraid and disgusted Ginny slides on Mrs. Voorhees's old sweater in an attempt to fool Jason. When Jason bust through the door she immediately begins talking to him as if she was his mother, while also hiding the machete behind her back. At first it works Jason believes that she is his undead mother, until she moves to swing the machete and he see's his real mothers head. Quickly Jason throws up his pitch fork blocking Ginny's attack when suddenly Paul appears in the door way and tackles Jason. After the two wrestle for a short bit Ginny slams the machete through Jason's shoulder. Ginny and Paul then retreat back to their cabin on the other side of the lake where they stumble upon Muffin ( a dog that belonged to one of the campers). As Ginny calls Muffin into the cabin an unmasked Jason leaps through the window and begins to pull her out. When Ginny awakes she is being put into an ambulance and is told that she was the only survivor, she has no recollection of what happened to Paul.</p>",

    "deck": "A horrific and bloody re envisionment of the classic horror tale from Camp Crystal Lake.",
    "description": "<p> </p><h3>***Warning somewhat explicit***</h3><p> </p><p>Everyone's favorite machete wielding, ski mask wearing maniac from has returned in Marcus Nispel's vivid re imagination of the classic horror tale Friday The 13th.</p><p>Unlike his predecessor's,Sean S. Cunningham, story Nispel's story jumps straight into 1980 where Mrs. Voorhees (played by Nana Visitor) attempting to kill the last camp councilor and then being beheaded. Next the story skips ahead to present day where a group of teenagers are walking through the forest in search of some sort of \"crop\". After a few minutes the teens find a place to set up camp and the time frame moves forward to later that night where one of the teens returns to the camp fire and talks about a boarded up camp that he found and begins to tell the story of that Friday the 13th in 1980. Two of the teens (Whitney Miller and Mike) break off to go check out the old camp. Leaving only three back at camp (Wade, Richie, and Amanda). Finally after Wade telling Richie that they are less than a half a mile away from the crop with Amanda in the background unbuttoning her shirt and applying lotion to herself, Richie finally tells Wade he should take a walk and Wade catches on and agrees. While Richie and Amanda are in the tent \"sleeping\" together Wade is walking through the forest. When he stops to take a leak he drops his GPA. When he zips up his pants and kneels down to pick it up he realizes he found the \"Crop\".....weed. When he stands back up Jason is standing behind him and he kills Wade. Next it moves to Whitney and Mike exploring the camp. After a few minutes they stumble upon a bed with the name Jason written on it. When they realize that that was the name of the boy in the story that Wade told they turn to leave only to have the door shut before them. When Mike kneels down to look under the door the famed machete comes up through the floor boards. Whitney runs and jumps into the bathtub, Mike close behind her only before he can reach the tub he is stabbed in the foot, then in the thigh, then in the hand. As Whitney attempts to pull him into the tub two hand bust through the floor boards and begin to drag Mike under the floor. After Mike is pulled under the floor Whitney gets up and runs from the cabin. Eventually the girl reaches her campsite only to find Amanda dead after being burned alive in her sleeping bag, soon she hears Richie’s voice as he is caught in a bear trap not far from the fire. When Whitney runs over to save him Jason quickly catches up and buries his machete in Richie’s head, before going after Whitney again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The story then skips forward where we are introduced into Whitney’s determined brother Clay, who is searching the area asking everyone he finds if they have seen his sister. He has a run-in with a group of parting teens (Trent, Jenna, Lawrence, Chewie, Nolan, Chelsea and Bree). Trent and his friends are headed to ’s parents cabin for vacation where Clay quickly appears. After yet another incident with Trent and Clay, Jenna volunteers to walk with Clay. The two eventually end up in the old camp while Nolan and Chelsea are out on getting slaughtered on the lake. While snooping around the old and Jenna are quickly forced to finding a hiding place as Jason soon turns up carrying something over his shoulder. The two quickly realize that the item which Jason is carrying is actually a dead body (the body of either Nolan or Chelsea its never really specified). Out of fear the Clay and Jenna sprint back to the cabin where Jason proceeds to pick the rest of the group off one by one until Clay and Jenna eventually find Jason’s secrete hideout and discover Whitney. Whitney, Clay, and Jenna all three panic as they are seemingly corned with Jason quickly gain ground on them. While escaping Jason finishes off Jenna before again pinning down Clay and Whitney in a barn where the two have their final stand. Through teamwork the two seemingly best Jason, and out of a last sign of respect the dump his “dead” body into the lake, then in classic Jason manner the masked slasher gives the audience one final scare.</p>",

    "deck": "Clive Barker's directorial debut, this film introduced the world to Pinhead and the Cenobites, based on The Hellbound Heart, a novella that Barker wrote himself.",
    "description": "<p>A man named Frank Cotton buys a puzzle <a href=\"/the-box/4055-55800/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55800\">box</a> called the Lament Configuration. It supposedly allows anyone who figures the puzzle out a transportation to a land of paradise. However, when Frank solves the puzzle, he summons the <a href=\"/cenobites/4060-42598/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42598\">Cenobites</a>, sadomasichist demons who torture others for pleasure. They rip Frank apart using hooked chians and then transport him to Hell.</p><p>Eventually, Frank's house becomes the possession of his brother, <a href=\"/larry-cotton/4005-103448/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-103448\">Larry</a>, who inherits the house after Frank disappeared. Larry and his family begin to start a life in the house, not knowing Frank died there, but <a href=\"/julia/4005-59085/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59085\">Julia</a>, Larry's British wife who had an affair with Frank, discover's the attic where Frank was killed, but not a speck of blood in sight. Coincedentally, Larry cuts himself on a nail and comes to the attic for help. And after drops of blood hit the attic flooroards, Frank's soul uses the blood to partially regenerate his body and escape from Hell.</p><p>Julia discover's Frank in the attic later on, but only as a partially muscled skeleton. Frank tells Julia to lure men back to her house so that he may kill them and drain them of their blood to fully regenerate his body. Julia does with several men and Frank gradually regenerates to his normal self (which is strange seeing as it only took a little blood to start with). However, <a href=\"/kirsty-cotton/4005-59097/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59097\">Kirsty</a>, Larry's daughter and Julia's step-daughter, sees a man being lured by Julia into the house. When Kirsty goes inside to investigate, she discovers about Frank and the puzzle box (which Frank had held onto this whole time). Kirsty steals the puzzle box and escapes the house, only to be taken to a hospital, in which the doctors don't believe her about her dead uncle returning to life.</p><p>Kirsty then decides to use the puzzle box herself to see what happens, but like Frank, the Cenobites appear to take her to Hell. The Cenobites, consisting of <a href=\"/chatterer/4005-53674/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53674\">Chatterer</a>, <a href=\"/butterball/4005-54272/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54272\">Butterball</a>, the <a href=\"/female-cenobite/4005-54276/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54276\">Female Cenobite</a> and the leader, <a href=\"/pinhead/4005-41465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41465\">Pinhead</a>, tell Kirsty they are from a land where pain and pleasure are one, and that she must join them there. However, Kirsty tells Pinhead that she knows where Frank is and that she'll lead them to him if they spare her. Pinhead agrees but if Kirsty double-crosses him, the Cenobites will \"tear her soul apart\".</p><p>Kirsty then runs home and finds Larry, who tells her that Frank has been stopped. Kirsty goes to the attic to find a skinless corpse, assuming it must be Frank, but then the Cenobites arrive again, demanding that they find the person who killed Frank. Kirsty goes to warn her father but discovers that Larry is in fact Frank, who had killed her father and skinned him so that he may wear the skin and escape Pinhead. Frank then tries to kill Kirsty but ends up killing Julia instead accidentally and chases Kirsty into the attic, where the Cenobites are waiting. Pinhead then summons hooked chains to stab Frank and keep him suspended as they transport him back to Hell. But after Kirsty thinks it's all over, the Cenobites break their deal and try to transport Kirsty too. Kirsty then leaves the house and uses the Lament Configuration to send Pinhead and the other Cenobites back to hell.</p><p>After Kirsty escapes the house that burns to the ground, a homeless man (that had been appearing throughout the film) picks up the puzzle box and tranforms into a skeletal demon, flying away to transport the box back to the original shopkeeper who sold Frank the box in the beginning. The shopkeeper then sees a new customer, and asks \"What's your pleasure?\"</p>",

    "description": "<p>Marty travels back to 1885 in order to rescue Doc Brown whom he believes is stranded there. Upon arrival Marty is caught in the middle of a conflict and damages the fuel tank making the time travel unable to achieve the 88 mph that it requires to return the pair to 1985. During the engineering of an alternative form of acceleration Marty has a run in with the Biff of 1885 and the first McFlys to live in Hill Valley. Doc Brown meets and falls in love with the town's new teacher despite the fact that she was supposed to die if it was not for his intervention which runs contrary to his belief that time travels should alter the the events of the past. Doc Brown and Marty conclude that they can get the time machine moving fast enough if they high jack a train and push it to it's maximum speed. Their plan does not work entirely as intended.</p>",

But when she enters the rickety mansion to seek her claim, she is frightened away by a wicked wave of ghosts. Determined to get her hands on this hidden fortune, she hires afterlife therapist Dr. James Harvey to exorcise the ghosts from the mansion. Harvey and his daugh- ter Kat move in, and soon Kat meets Casper, the ghost of a young boy who's \"the friendliest ghost you know.\" But not so friendly are Casper's uncles--Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie--who are determined to drive all \"fleshies\" away. Ultimately, it is up to Harvey and Kat to help the ghosts cross over to the other side.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A textual prologue tells about Snow White living in a castle with her wicked stepmother, the Evil Queen. One day, she begins to fear that Snow White's beauty will be more powerful that hers. Because of that, the Queen has Snow White dressed as rags and asks the Magic Mirror, \"Who's the fairest of them all\"?. As long as the Mirror answers that the Queen is fairest, Snow White is safe from her stepmother's jealousy. <br /> <br />In one day, when the Queen asks the Magic Mirror who is the fairest of them all, he answers Snow White, angering her. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Snow White is shown cleaning the castle when a prince comes and sings to her. Unknown to them, the Queen is watching this from her window and is jealous of it. <br /> <br />The Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White in a forest to get flowers and kill her there. When the Huntsman refuses to do such command, the Queen angrily reminds him of the penalty he gets for failing her. She tells him that in order to make sure he doesn't fail, he will bring back Snow White's heart in a box. <br /> <br />In a forest, the Huntsman prepares to kill Snow White, but refuses to do so, and tells her about the Queen is planning to kill her because of her jealousy. He tells her to hide in the forest as Snow White runs away. While running away, she fainted by the scary eyes. It is revealed to be the animals. They wake Snow White up and brings her to the dwarfs' cottage where she cleans up all the mess. <br /> <br />By the time the dwarfs came back from working in a mine, they find their house is clean and that Snow White in a bed. They introduces themselves as Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. When Snow White told them about the Queen is going to kill her, the dwarfs are terrified of her. Snow White says that the Queen wouldn't find her in the cottage, but Grumpy is not convinced because she uses black magic. <br /> <br />Afterwards, Snow White prepares soup for the dwarfs, but tells them to wash their hands first. When Grumpy refuses, the dwarfs forcefully wash him and leave him when Snow White calls for them. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, in the castle, the Queen asks the Magic Mirror who now is the fairest of them all and he answers that Snow White is still the fairest of them all. When the Queen brings a heart as evidence that she is dead, the Mirror is not fooled by it and tells her that she has the heart of a pig, leading the Queen to realize that she is tricked and goes to the dungeon below. <br /> <br />Inside, the Queen prepares a potion to transform herself into an old peddler. After that, she reads about the Sleeping Death spell. <br /> <br />For Snow White, she is dancing with the dwarfs in the night and they fall asleep. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the Queen is preparing her spell by putting an apple to the poison as it turns read to conceal the sign of poison. However, she is convinced that there might be an antidote. The Queen checks on the book to find the antidote for Sleeping Death and it is read that the antidote is love's first kiss. Upon seeing that, the Queen doesn't have to worry about that because once the dwarfs think Snow White is dead, she will be buried alive. The Queen goes to the forest. <br /> <br />The next day, the dwarfs are off to work. Snow White kisses them one by one in the head. Grumpy warns her to not any strangers in the cottage. <br /> <br />While Snow White is making pie, she is greeted by the Queen in disguise. While the two are talking, the animals realize that the peddler is the Queen as the vultures, sensing her death, follow her around. They attack her and Snow White shoos them away. After being rescued, the Queen fakes being sick and goes to the cottage. <br /> <br />Now that Snow White doesn't believe them, the animals rush to a mine and try to warn the dwarfs. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the Queen tricks Snow White into thinking that the poison apple is a wishing apple. When asking her what is her wish, Snow White replies that she saw someone which the Queen thinks about the prince, whom she saw earlier singing to Snow White. <br /> <br />The dwarfs are still struggling with the animals who try to warn them about the Queen. They are finally convinced when Sleepy confirms it and they race back to the cottage. <br /> <br />However, Snow White eats the poison apple and she collapses. The Queen runs away as the dwarfs chases her through a cliff in a stormy night. She tries to kill them by dropping a boulder on them, but falls to her death when a lightning bolt strikes on her. The vultures go to her afterwards. <br /> <br />The dwarfs are mourning for Snow White, including Grumpy. <br /> <br />A text is shown that the dwarfs cannot find themselves in their hearts to bury Snow White alive. Because of that, they put her in a glass coffin instead. <br /> <br />Just then, a prince came and kisses Snow White, reviving her. She says goodbye to the dwarfs as she leaves with the prince, earning her happy ending.</p>",

He had intended Fantasia to be a recurring show featuring different segments along with old favorites. However, this was not to happen as the movie was a box office failure. Roy E. Disney would honor Walt's original idea with the release of <a data-ref-id=\"4025-908\" href=\"/fantasia-2000/4025-908/\">Fantasia 2000</a> in 1999. Roy was continuing to work on Fantasia as evidence by some pre-production work for Fantasia 2006, a project that was later abandoned. Some of these shorts were released as DVD extra and include: The Little Match Girl (2006), One by One (2004), and possibly Destino (2002).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/126071/2433471-09.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2433471\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/126071/2433471-09.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2433471\"><img alt=\"Mickey Mouse and Leopold Stokowski\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/126071/2433471-09.png\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/126071/2433471-09.png 1920w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/126071/2433471-09.png 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/126071/2433471-09.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Mickey Mouse and Leopold Stokowski</figcaption></figure><p>The movie promiently features Leopold Stokowski conducting The Philadelphia Orchestra.</p><p>The segments from Fantasia are as follows:</p><ul><li>Footage of the orchestra itself and abstract imagery to Johann Sebastian Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\"</li><li>The changing of the seasons with fairies, flowers, mushrooms, etc. to selections from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker Suite\"</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-39413\" href=\"/mickey-mouse/4005-39413/\">Mickey Mouse</a> as an apprentice to the sorcerer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57769\" href=\"/yen-sid/4005-57769/\">Yen Sid</a> who misuses his master's power to complete his chores set to Paul Dukas' \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\"</li><li>The history of earth, particularly the time and fall of the dinosaurs to Igor Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\"</li><li>A jazz piece is played during \"Intermission\" along with visualization of a white line.</li><li>The mythological figures of ancient Greece celebrate spring including unicorns and satyrs frolicking in the field, pegasi learning to fly, centaurs pairing up, and a wine festival with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2760\" href=\"/dionysus/4005-2760/\">Bacchus</a> himself in attendance when the festival is interrupted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70036\" href=\"/zeus/4005-70036/\">Zeus</a>.

As the story unfolds Light's morality begins to waver as he kills not just the criminals who argueably deserve punishment, but all who get in the way of the world's new god, Kira. But when someone who is his intellectual equal, the detective known as L surfaces, Light is forced into a cat and mouse game of intellects with deadly implications.</p>",

Johnny is the grandson of a Georgia plantation owner and lives with her because his parents' marriage is collapsing. Ginny is the only daughter of a poor, rural family. Toby is a young servant. While the film was a 1940s hits and still relatively popular, there have been concerns of racism. Partly because Remus remains poor and in a subservient position after an implied lifetime of loyal service, partly because of taking an interest in the upbringing of white children rather than the black ones. </p>",

He is placed under the supervision of respected senior officer Sinestro(Victor Garber), who is investigating Abin's murder. Abin was killed while doing an undercover investigation of Kanjar Ro (Kurtwood Smith), who managed to locate and steal the yellow element. What no one realizes is that Sinestro provided Kanjar with the location of the element, in order to have it fashioned into a weapon of comparable power to the Green Lantern battery.</p><p>It is revealed that before any other sentient beings existed in the universe, the Guardians of the Universe harnessed the power of the <i>green element</i>, the greatest power in the universe, to create the Green Lantern battery. However, the battery had a flaw: the color yellow, the one part of the light spectrum that can resist green. The most concentrated source of yellow energy, the <i>yellow element</i>, was hidden by the Guardians to prevent others from using it against them.</p><p>Jordan quickly comes to understand that Sinestro's beliefs are not in line with those of the Guardians: Sinestro believes that the Guardians have reduced the Corps to merely picking up the messes criminals create as opposed to proactively dealing with the problem. During a mission to capture Kanjar Ro, Jordan is knocked unconscious by Kanjar's energy staff. Sinestro comes in and kills Kanjar, pinning the blame on Jordan. Jordan is stripped of his ring as punishment.</p><p>While Jordan waits to be taken home, Sinestro uses his ring to temporarily animate Kanjar's corpse allowing him to learn the location of Qward, where the yellow element weapon is being fashioned. Jordan convinces fellow Lanterns Boodikka and Kilowog that Sinestro is not what he seems. They catch Sinestro red-handed, but Boodikka turns out to be in league with Sinestro and attacks Jordan and Kilowog. Sinestro escapes, and Boodikka is killed when Jordan tricks her into destroying Kanjar's unstable energy staff.</p><p>On Qward, the Weaponers bestow Sinestro with the yellow ring and battery. Using its power, he lays waste to Oa, the yellow light easily overcoming the Green Lantern rings. The yellow battery destroys the green battery, rendering all the Green Lantern Corps' power rings inert and causing death by asphyxiation of countless Green Lanterns including Tomar Re and General Kreon, who were in space at the time when their rings failed. Jordan, having recovered his ring moments too late, pounds on the inert green element, breaking it and absorbing the whole of its power. Imbued with the full might of the green energy, he destroys the yellow battery by smashing it between two moons.</p><p>However, having exhausted most of his power to destroy the yellow battery, Jordan is left weakened against Sinestro. After a pitched battle, Jordan uses the last of his power to knock Sinestro to the surface of Oa, where Kilowog crushes the yellow ring (as well as Sinestro's hand) with his foot. Kilowog having his ring regained some of its power, then saves Jordan in time.</p><p>Once Oa is rebuilt and the Green Lantern battery restored, Jordan is asked by the Guardians to lead the Corps in reciting the Green Lantern oath and Ganthet is put in charge of the Guardians of the Universe by Appa Ali Apsa. Hal Jordan then leaves for Earth to check in with his other boss, Carol Ferris, remarking on the long \"commute\".</p>",
