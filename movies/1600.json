    "description": "<p><em>Based on real events, the dramatic thriller “Argo” chronicles the life-or-death covert operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis, focusing on the little-known role that the CIA and Hollywood played—information that was not declassified until many years after the event.</em></p><p><em>Academy Award® winner Ben Affleck (“The Town,” “Good Will Hunting”) directs and stars in the film, which is produced by Oscar® nominee Grant Heslov (“Good Night, and Good Luck.”), Affleck, and Oscar® winner George Clooney (“Syriana”).</em></p><p><em>On November 4, 1979, as the Iranian revolution reaches its boiling point, militants storm the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage. But, in the midst of the chaos, six Americans manage to slip away and find refuge in the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor. Knowing it is only a matter of time before the six are found out and likely killed, the Canadian and American governments ask the CIA to intervene. The CIA turns to their top “exfiltration” specialist, Tony Mendez, to come up with a plan to get the six Americans safely out of the country. A plan so incredible, it could only happen in the movies.</em></p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The movie opens with a series of comic book panels illustrating the region's history, from the <a href=\"/persians/4060-56530/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56530\">Persian</a> Empire to the modern state of <a href=\"/iran/4020-55903/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55903\">Iran</a>, including the joint U.S./<a href=\"/england/4020-55794/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\">U.K.</a> overthrow of the democratically elected head of state and installation of the Shah.

Armed with fake passports they accompany Mendez on fake 'location scouting' to enhance their cover story, but find that all appearances in public go bad as Westerners in general are routinely harassed and threatened.</p><p>The C.I.A. is pressured to abort on the operation to prevent interference with a hostage rescue mission, but knowing that he's already risked exposing the escapees to execution, Mendez feels he has no choice but to continue, whether or not O'Donnell and the Stateside members of the team are on-board or not.</p><p>At the airport, the escapees' flight reservations are initially denied, but then are confirmed at the last minute. They are then detained by a suspicious guard, who only releases them after they show him Jack Kirby's artwork, and give him one of the pieces of original art.</p><p>Back in the United States, the C.I.A. buries all records about the mission, including the involvement of Chambers and Kirby, and allows the Canadian government to take credit for the operation until U.S. President <a href=\"/bill-clinton/4005-11570/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11570\">Bill Clinton</a> declassifies the documents 20 years later.</p><h2>Production</h2><p>The inspiration for the screenplay initially came from a WIRED Magazine article.

Ben Affleck played the role of Tony Mendez himself.

Many of the props were purchased off eBay so the production could have real <a href=\"/star-trek/4050-3054/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3054\">Star Trek</a> toys and other props like period appropriate televisions, etc.</p><p>The film features liberal use of period rock and soul hits, mostly by artists on the Warner Bros. label.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p><i>Argo</i> received Rottentomatoe's 2012 'Golden Tomato' award for given for ‘Best Reviewed Film In Wide Release’. It had a 96% positive score at Rotten Tomatoes, beating <a href=\"/the-avengers/4025-936/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-936\"><i>The Avengers</i></a> and <i><a href=\"/skyfall/4025-1545/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1545\">Skyfall</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/the-dark-knight-rises/4025-1214/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1214\">The Dark Knight Rises</a></i>. It also received the Oscar for Best Picture.</p><p>Comic artist <a href=\"/jim-lee/4040-2399/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2399\">Jim Lee</a> Tweeted after seeing the movie that he not only enjoyed the film, but was surprised to find out that he actually owns some of the original Jack Kirby artwork which he bought at auction with no knowledge of their historical significance.</p><p>Like <i><a href=\"/300/4025-16/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-16\">300</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/persepolis/4025-208/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-208\">Persepolis</a></i> before it, <i>Argo</i> was declared anti-Iranian and banned in Iran shortly after it's premiere. Thus the film's full reception by critics and audiences in Iran is still largely unknown. While it has been condemned by the Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, there have reportedly been clandestine screenings on college campuses that have met with positive audience response, and bootleg copies of the film have become a hot commodity, reputedly even outselling <i>A Separation</i>, the Iranian film that won the Best Foreign Film Oscar the previous year.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

But there is a big problem with their unique alliance: Neither knows that the other is an undercover federal agent.</em></p><p><em>For the past 12 months, DEA agent Bobby Trench (Washington) and U.S. naval intelligence officer Marcus Stigman (Wahlberg) have been reluctantly attached at the hip. Working undercover as members of a narcotics syndicate, each man distrusts his partner as much as the criminals they have both been tasked to take down.</em></p><p><em>When their attempt to infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel and recover millions goes haywire, Trench and Stigman are suddenly disavowed by their superiors. Now that everyone wants them in jail or in the ground, the only person they can count on is the other. Unfortunately for their pursuers, when good guys spend years pretending to be bad, they pick up a few tricks along the way.\"</em></p><p> </p><p>Based on the series <a href=\"/two-guns/4050-23370/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-23370\"><em>Two Guns</em></a> (2007).</p>",

(Ghost in the Shell, Kill Bill: Vol.1). Mass Effect: Paragon Lost, prequel to the best-selling Mass Effect 3, follows the early career of Alliance Marine, James Vega (Freddie Prinze Jr.) as he leads an elite Special Forces squad into battle against a mysterious alien threat known as the Collectors. Stationed at a colony in a remote star system, Vega and his troops must protect the colonists from the alien invaders bent on abducting humans for unknown purposes. Outmanned and outgunned, Vega must rally his squad to defend the colony at all costs − even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.</i><sup><a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Paragon_Lost#cite_note-4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br /></a></sup></p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><i>Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone</i> (ヱヴァンゲリヲン新劇場版:序, <em>Evangerion Shin Gekijōban: Jo</em>) is an action / science fiction / psychological drama animated movie based upon an alternate Earth history where the beings known as Angels are out to destroy humanity. It was directed and written by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hideaki-anno/4040-69351/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-69351\">Hideaki Anno</a>. Music was composed by Shiro Sagisu. The Studio Khara, Anno's own production company, produced the movie and distributed by Studio Khara &amp; The Klockworx Co., Ltd.. It's an animated film based upon the original Hideaki Anno anime series, Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995). The <i>Evangelion: 1.0</i> is the first film of four in the re-adaptation of the original story. Unlike other re-releases of other anime series being brought to theaters, where production would simply stretch the original cell work for the big screen. The <i>Rebuild of Evangelion</i> project is a complete remake from the ground up and much of the story elements have been changed to create a new story, and a promise of new characters for the future films. The movie was designed independent of the anime's original production company, <a href=\"/gainax/4040-65155/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-65155\">GAINAX</a>; but was created with their cooperation.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>DVD &amp; Blu-ray</h3><p><i>Evangelion: 1.0</i> would have minor alterations to put to picture, editing, and sound quality. It was retitled as <i>Evangelion: 1.01</i> and released as a two-disc special edition DVD in Japan on April 25, 2008. There were 300,000 of these special-edition DVD sets made, and the \"Normal Edition\" released on May 21, 2008. The \"Limited Edition\" release would sell and estimated 263,395 units in the first six months of it's sales and ranked as the fourth best-selling DVD in Japan. In May 27, 2009 three minutes were added to the film for the Blu-ray Disc and new DVD release and titled as <i>Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone</i>. Though FUNimation had released the <i>Evangelion: 1.01</i> edition on November 17, 2009, they released <i>Evangelion: 1.11</i> Blu-ray/DVD on March 9, 2010. Included was a 20 page booklet, the \"Angel of Doom\" music video, and a preview of the next film, <i>Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance</i>, set to <i>\"\"Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words) -2007 MIX-\"</i>, from the <i>Evangelion: 1.0</i> OST.</p>",

It was directed and written by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hideaki-anno/4040-69351/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-69351\">Hideaki Anno</a>. Music was composed by Shiro Sagisu. The Studio Khara company produced the movie . It's an animated film based upon the original Hideaki Anno anime series, Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995). The <i>Evangelion 3.0</i> is the third film of four in the re-adaptation of the original story. Unlike other re-releases of other anime series being brought to theaters, where production would simply stretch the original cell work for the big screen. The <i>Rebuild of Evangelion</i> project is a complete remake from the ground up and much of the story elements have been changed to create a sightly different story.</p><p>The film was released on November 17th 2012 in Japan and will be released on January 11, 2013 in America.</p>",

    "description": "<p> 10 year old Richard Tyler lives his life in fear, of pretty much everything. His parents constantly encourage him to live more fearlessly but I meets with little to no success.</p><p>During one of these ventures he's sent out by his father to retrieve nails from the hardware store. Upon this journey he finds himself in the middle of a torrential storm and seeks refuge in a nearby library. He's manipulated by the librarian Mr. Dewey (played by Christopher Lloyd) into signing for a library card and checking out a book.<br /><br /> He wanders around the library until he slips on some water that dripped off of his jacket and knocks himself unconscious upon hitting the floor. He awakens to find himself now an illustration. Mr. Dewey, now donning the persona (Pagemaster) sends him on a mission to find the exit.<br /><br />Along the way he becomes accompanied by three books, Adventure the pirate book, Fantasy the fairy god mother-esque fantasy book, and horror who is a disturbing hunchback book with a crooked spine.<br /><br />The group triumphs through numerous well-known novels such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Moby Dick. Upon making it to the fantasy section they discover the exit sign atop a mountain, guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. Richard is swallowed whole by the dragon and within his intestines he finds a Jack and the Beanstalk book and opens it. <br /><br />A giant Beanstalk erupts out of the dragons throat and Richard climbs out and the dragon bites the beanstalk and is defeated. The heroes arrive at the exit and find the Pagemaster awaiting them. He explains to Richard how he defeated some of the most epic antagonists in literature and congratulates him. <br /><br />Richard awakes and checks his books out, rushing home with a new found courage and spends the night in his tree house. Adventure, Fantasy and Horror make a final appearance as Silhouettes talking on the wall and blowing out his candle.</p>",
