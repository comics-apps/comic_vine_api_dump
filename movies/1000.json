    "description": "<h2>Plot</h2><p>The movie starts out with Spacely Sprockets in dire financial trouble, because they can't get their new project \"Orbiting Ore Astroid\" to function properly. To make things worse all of the vice presidents in charge of this project run off. In despiration Mr. Spacely uses his computer to find a new VP and it selects George Jetson. George goes home to tell his family the good news, however they are upset that they are going to have to give up their intrests to move away to the astroid. </p><p> </p><p>As they move into their new home the Jetsons meet their new neighbors Rudy-2, Lucy-2, and their child Teddy-2. They also meet the Furbolo family and their daughter Fergie. The next day at work Rudy-2, who works with George, shows George how the plant works to prepare for the re-opening. While the men are at work Jane, Judy, and Lucy-2 all go shopping, while at the mall Judy wanders off and meets Apollo Blue whom she develops a crush on. </p><p> </p><p>Later on that day at the plant re-opening George activates the machine only to have it malfunction yet again. Rudy-2 tells George of all the previous mishaps and warns him that they may not have been accidents but instead they may be warnings, and it may be better to return home than to continue. George refuses and orders repairs to be made, however the next day the machine malfunctions again. With Mr. Spacely growing angrier and more impatient George decides to stay overnight at the plant to figure out what is happening. </p><p> </p><p>Elroy, Teddy-2, and tag-a-long Fergie sneak off and follow George to the plant, but Jane discovers they are missing and send Judy and Apollo to find them. At the plant Judy and Apollo find the kids, but they also find a small creature called a Grungee. This grungee leads them to the center of the astroid where it is revealed who keeps sabotaging the machinery. It turns out that the factory's drill is destroying the Grungee's home, and they have been trying to stop it. With the kids still missing Jane and Astro set out to the factory to find them, while there they meet up with Rudy-2. Rudy-2 stays in the factory whle Jane and Astro travel below, where they find George tied-up by the Grungees. George is furious until the others tell him the whole story. </p><p> </p><p>While everyone is still below Mr. Spacely arrives at the plant and activates the drill against Rudy-2's protest. The drill knocks down a bunch of rocks almost hitting Elroy until some Grungees pull him to safety. Returning topside everyone tells Mr. Spacely to stop the drill, but when he refuses George malfunctions the machine. George explains to a furious Spacely that the asteroid is inhabited by the Grungees, but it is found out that he has known this all along. Mr. Spacely and the Grungees agree on a deal that lets the Grungees run the plant, but instead of drilling for ore the plant will recycle old sprockets to make new ones. Spacely then gives George his old job on earth back, and the family has to say good-bye to their new friends and return home. </p>",

    "deck": "A Halloween themed anthology that the \"Trick 'r Treat\" graphic novel adaptation is based on.",
    "description": "<p>Trick ‘r Treat is an anthology of four connected Halloween stories.   A trick-or-treater known as Sam who wears orange pajamas and a burlap sack appears in all of the interlocking stories. If you pay attention you will notice characters from the stories overlapping in minor appearances. </p> <p><strong><u>PLOT:</u></strong></p> <div class=\"js-item-cage\"> <div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\"><a href=\"/trick-r-treat/223-1080/#\">SPOILER WARNING: Click here to reveal hidden content.</a></div> <div class=\"js-spoiler-div\"> <p>Opening: The film opens with Emma and Henry arriving home in their costumes after a long night.   Emma is about to blow out a jack o’lantern, and Henry tells her not to because of tradition; she disregards him and blows it out anyways. Henry goes inside while Emma insists on taking down some of their decorations. She is killed while outside by an unknown attacker who uses a pumpkin lollipop. Henry who had fallen asleep comes outside once he realises Emma has yet to come inside. He finds her severed head attached to the post of one of their many ghost-scarecrows. </p> <p>Part One – The Principal: Principal Wilkins catches a overweight boy named Charlie taking more than his share of candy from the dish on his porch. Wilkins tells the boy to sit and gives him more candy, which he inhales. As Charlie starts t feel sick Wilkins tells the boy that he should have checked his candy. And Charlie begins to vomit uncontrollably all over Wilkins steps. Wilkins drags the body into the house and into the backyard where he burries him along with another body. His neighbour Mr. Kreeg comes outside with his dog while he is burying the bodies and complains about Wilkins’ kid, and goes back inside. Before The principal goes back inside he sees Kreeg at his window begging for help.   But he ignores him. Wilkins and his son go down to hte basement with a large kitchen knife to carve a jack o’lantern, which turns out to be Charlie’s decapitated head. </p> <p>Part Two- The Schoolbus Massacre Revisited: Four kids (Macy, Schrader, Sara, Chip) are going around the neighbourhood collecting Jack o’lanterns, They stop at a strange girl name Rhonda’s house (which is decorated by dozens of jack o’lanterns. The five of them continue on to an abandoned rock quarry and Macy tells a local legnd of the ‘Halloween Schoolbus Massacre’ – which is the story of a bus driver who was paid by the parents of challenged/disturbed children to kill their children. The school bus crashed into the river at the bottom of the quarry, and the bus driver was the only one to survive – the lanterns were brought to pay respect to the children who died that day, and the 4 original children play a prank on Rhonda pretending to be attacked by the dead children. She is ingured and becomes frightened retreating to the elevator   which leads back up to the main quarry when there are more screams in the distance.  She locks herself in the elevator and refuses to let the others in when the actual students from the massacre appear. Mary, Schrader, Sara and Chip appear to be murdered by the students and all you can here is their screams and what sounds like limbs being torn apart from above. </p> <p>Part Three - Surprise Party: A group of Four young women pick up costumes and dates at a local costume shoppe. Laurie the 22 year old ‘virgin’ dressed as little red riding hood, is the only one left to not find a date and decides to meet the others at the party in the woods later. On her way to the party, alone in the woods she is attacked by a ‘vampire’.  At the party a figure wrapped in Laurie’s red cloak falls from the trees. The person is revealed to be the ‘vampire’ and Laurie appears from the trees. The ‘vampire’ turns out to be a battered Mr. Wilkins, wearing fake fangs. Laurie tells him to be gentle, and that it is her first time, as she transformes into a werewolf ripping off her skin, along with all the other girls at the party. They eat their dates. </p> <p>Part Four – Meet Sam: This part of the story takes place at the home of Mr.Kreeg – who hates Halloween. Kreeg is attacked by Sam (the masked Trick-or-treater who appeared in all of the stories)   and in a bedroom upstairs the walls are covered in writing which looks to be applied in blood. Kreeg unmasks Sam, and he is shown to have a head that looks like a cross between a skull and a pumpkin. Kreeg Shoots Sam with a Shotgun and pumpkin guts splatter. As Kreeg dials 9-1-1 Sam attacks again, but this time as we think he is about to stab Kreeg with the sucker, he stabs into the chocolate bar on his chest and eats it. He then leaves the house.   Kreeg wasburning photos  in his fireplace; these Photos show Kreeg to be the School bus driver from the Massacre.    </p> <p>Conclusion:    Later, when Kreeg is all bandaged up from his encounter with Sam, he gives out candy to the children who come to his house, while doing this he sees Emma blowing out the Jack o’lantern and Sam going across to their house. Rhonda is walking by with her wagon and is almost hit by a car full of the girls from the woods. Principal Wilkin’s son is sitting on the front porch handing out candy dressed as his father was earlier. Once back inside the doorbell rings once more, and as he opens the door he finds the children from the massacre on his steps saying ‘Trick or Treat’ with arms outstretched for candy. In the style of a comic book,  we are shown Kreeg’s inevitable doom. </p></div></div> <p>     </p>",

    "description": "<p>The Mario Brothers are being driven out of business by the mafia named Scapelli Construction Company. Luigi falls in love with an orphaned NYU student, Daisy, who is digging under the Brooklyn Bridge for dinosaur bones. They go on a date and she takes Luigi to the dig and sees Scapelli's men sabotage the site by leaving the water-pipes open. Luigi tries to stop it but he does not have his tools on him so he can not fix it. They rush back to his apartment where they tell Mario about it. The three go back to the flooding and the Mario Bros. manage to fix it but are knocked out by two strangers, Iggy and Spike. The two kidnap Daisy.</p><p>Mario and Luigi awaken a while later and head into the caves following Daisy's screaming and discover a portal. Mario and Luigi follow Daisy. They find themselves in a strange parallel world where a race of people evolved from dinosaurs rather than the mammalian ancestry of true humans. Sixty-five million years ago, a meteorite crashed into the Earth, and in doing so ripped the universe into two parallel dimensions. All the surviving dinosaurs of the time crossed over into this new realm before being sealed there forever. Iggy and Spike turn out to be workers of King Koopa. King Koopa's goal is to merge his world with the real world. It turns out that Daisy is the princess of the other dimension but when Koopa overthrew Daisy's father, Daisy's mother took her to New York using the portal. The portal exploded and killed Daisy's mother. When Anthony Scapelli was blasting at the cave, the portal was reopened. When Koopa hears about the re-opening of the portal, he sends Spike and Iggy to find Daisy and the rock to merge the dimensions and make Koopa the king of both worlds. Spike and Iggy decide to turn on Koopa and join forces with Mario and Luigi. Koopa thinks only Daisy can merge the worlds. It turns out Mario and Luigi were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>During the big finale, the worlds merge, during which Scapelli gets his comeuppance when Koopa turns him into a primate by mistake while aiming for Mario, but Luigi and Daisy take back the rock and the worlds separate. Mario fights the Koopa King and wins when he and Luigi devolve him, transforming him into a ferocious Tyrannosaurus. Koopa then leaps out for one last attack but Mario and Luigi turn him into primeval slime, killing him. The brothers save the two worlds from King Koopa and Daisy's father turns back to normal ( From being a Toad) and reclaims control over the kingdom. The brothers return home, Luigi and Daisy tell each other that they love the other but Daisy cannot return to New York until they fix the kingdom. Mario rephrases Daisy's words to Luigi but he doesn't care. He is deeply hurt and Luigi kisses her goodbye and the the Mario Bros. go back to New York. Daisy, Yoshi and Toad, all watch them leave. About three weeks later, Daisy returns for Mario and Luigi's help in fighting more villains. Meanwhile, Mario and Luigi's story is televised, giving them their name \"Super Mario Bros.\"</p>",

    "description": "<p>After a shadowy figure gets hung and coroner's report claims that Lupin III has been executed. However only one man refuses to believe that he's dead which is Inspector Zenigata. Upon observing the resting place of Lupin, he encounters the theif who is alive and well. During a brief chase, Lupin manages to escape the Inspector by using a hang glider. Some time later, Lupin and Jigen sneak through a pyramid in the middle of Egypt where they found the Philospher's Stone. Once they found the stone they accidently triggered an alarm system which alerts the Egyptian police who are teamed up Zenigata. The two thieves flee from the pyramid by motorcycle along with the help of Goemon and made their escape by driving Lupin's car that's located beyond the pyramid. In France, Lupin meets up with Fujiko to give her the stone as a present only to discover that Fujiko steals the stone right from him leaving him stun in the process. The stone that Fujiko took was actually a fake with a tranmitter inside it so that way Lupin is able to hear who Fujiko is working for. The contractor soon idsocvered that the stone is fake and plans to sends out two of his henchmen to kill Lupin for making a mockery out of him.</p><p>After defeating the pursuing helicopter and over size truck, Lupin, Jigen, and Goemon soon find the car and their hideout destroyed by the mysterious contractor's henchmen. Jigen and Goemon place the blame on Lupin for trusting Fujiko so much that is lead to the sacrifice of their headquarters and their only needs of tranportation. Lupin eventually tells them that he'll keep Fujiko out of their affairs. But that statement didn't change the fact that they have no supllies, rations, or any vehicle to aid them on their travels. So they travel the desert to the direction of the ocean, while accidently setting off some booby traps placed by the men that are after them. They eventually found a house stocked with rations and water. Everything was fine, until a wounded Fujiko showed up for Lupin's help. Lupin who could never stay mad at her ends up alienating Jigen and Goemon who want nothing to do with the treacherous woman. Later that night, Fujiko drugs Lupin and they both end up being captured by Flinch, one of the henchmen that tried to killed Lupin earlier. After Jigen and Goemon witness what happened to Lupin, their only clue is a piece of paper that says Water on it. They both travel to Rome to find info on Lupin's whereabouts. Jigen is being pursued by a goverment Agent named Gordon. Only for the agent to end up being grabbed by Jigen quick reflexes who is now threatening the agent for why he's being stalked. Only to end up being surrounded by Navy seals who one of them has Goemon under arrest. The navy bring Jigen and Goemon to a sea docked navy ship, to be interviewed by Starky, an important government official from America. He plays a tape of an interrupted conversation between a mysterious voice, the President &amp; the General Secratary. Starky then asked Jigen and Goemon on who the mysterious voice is. Jigen however only states that if they knew they wouldn't be where they are now and provides Gordon with the paper he found earlier which doesn't sum up who the person on the tape was. Starky decided that Jigen and Goemon know nothing and releases them on the sole purpose of finding the mysterious man on the tape. Jigen and Goemon immidately know what to find Lupin after it turns out that the piece of paper had invisible ink written on it when dosed with water which reveals the word: Caribean.</p><p>Meanwhile on a Caribean island, Lupin managed to escape his prison cell and then he explores the island only to discover it has various historical figures who are all long dead including Napolean and Hitler. Lupin finally comes face to face with the man in charge of the island, Howard Lockewood who refers to himself as Mamo. Mamo gives Lupin an opurtunity to have eternal life but Lupin is only interested in getting the Philosper's Stone back. He manages to find the stone after his encounter with Mamo and finds Fujiko on the island as well. They both get chased by a group of henchmen and then find themselves in Mamo's lair. There Mamo reveals to both Lupin and Fujiko that the island is populated with clones. After deeming Lupin unworthy for eternal life, he tries to kill Lupin by meanings of torture. Lupin is saved by Jigen who puts a bullet through Mamo's head. The group then tries to escape from the island only for Goemon to end up in a duel against Flinch. Goemon learns that his sword isn't able to penetrate Flinch's armor so he instead cuts up Flinch's head which leads Flinch dead in the water. Goemon's sword is detipped much to his sorrow that his sword wasn't able to cut someone's armor. As he and the rest of the gang escape from the island by boat, they are chased by Zenigata who choose the wrong boat to pursue them.</p><p>Zenigata now finds himself ashore on a beach where he is met with his Commissioner who reveals to him that he's no longer on Lupin's case due to circumstances that are beyond the I.C.P.O.'s control. He tries to encourage Zenigata that this is an opportunity to take a vacation and spend time with his family he rarely sees. Zenigata however resigns from Interpol and pursues Lupin by himself. Then he annouces to himself that Columbia is the place where he arrests Lupin. Meanwhile Lupin, Fujiko, &amp; Jigen are hiding out at an inn excluding Goemon who wished to train harder alone. They are then thrust into a trippy vision made by Mamo who reveals to them on how he's been involved with every moment in human history making him a God. After the vision Jigen and Fujiko were baffled if that was real or just an illusion. Lupin however debunks the vision by putting out that the furniture has been moved recently and that they were drugged by the coffee they were drinking earlier prooving the whoel thing was just a parlor trick. Mamo shows up to congraguate Lupin on his deductions and reclaims Fujiko by floating away with her. Lupin however dare Mamo to prove he is a god and not an illusionist. Mamo respond by setting off a massive earthquake. This earthquake alerted Gordon and Starky who now know where Mamo is located.</p><p>Lupin soon figured out where the source of the earthquake came from and followed it believing that it's where Mamo is hiding out in. Jigen decided to not be involved with the fight fearing that it's not worth dying over. Despite Jigen's warning, Lupin ventured out to the secluded hideout. Upon exploring the hideout Lupin managed to sabotage the missiles that were meant to wipe out the world in order for Mamo and the reluctant Fujiko to have the whole planet for their own. The missiles instead exploded at the launching ports. The furious Mamo takes Fujiko wih him to a large rocket while Lupin pursues him only to be fended off by a series of lasers. Lupin was in a tight spot only to rememnber that he still has the tip of Goemon's sword in his pocket which is the answer to how he'll be able to defeat Mamo. Lupin faces Mamo again who believes Lupin admits to defeat and even reveals to Lupin that the Lupin who got executed was in fact a clone and the Lupin really is the legit Lupin. As another series of lasers shoot out Lupin uses the blade's tip to deflect the lasers towards Mamo who gets incarcinated from the blast of the beams. Lupin believed that he killed the real Mamo and not a clone, only for the rocket to emere and reeal a giant brain who proclaims to be the original Mamo. He plans to leave Earth by rocket and one day return to it as a God. Before the rocket left, Lupin placed an explosive device which denotinated in space. The gigantic brain is no longer protected in it's own glass case and drifts towards the sun where Mamo is finally no more. After escaping from the hideout, Lupin gets handcuffed by the ankles by Zenigata who handcuffs his own ankle making sure Lupin will not escape by foot. Lupin tried to make Zenigata think that the real Lupin was executed, but Zenigata didn't care if he was a clone or not. As long as there's a Lupin in the world, Zenigata stated he'll always be there to try to arrest that Lupin. Fujiko was about to offer Lupin some help until the entire hideout is bombarded by missiles being launched by the U.S. government lead by Gordon himself. Who is making sure that nothing will live after bombing the whole location with nukes. Jigen shows up by plane but only managed to save Fujiko leaving Lupin and Zenigata forced to dash through the stretched field that is being striked by missiles. Managing to evade any of them that was about to kill them.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Upon robbing a large sum of money from a casino, Lupin &amp; Jigen dashed to the Fiat 500 with bags full of money. The casino watchmen try to gun them down only to miss them and are forced to pursue them by car. Only to discover that all of their cars have been sabotage upon igniting their engines. Lupin and Jigen drive off on a highway laughing due to their success in robbing the casino's entire stash of money. Lupin however looked closely at the bills and realizes that they are counterfeit. He informs Jigen of this and knows that the money they stole is fake cause he has come across seeing this brand of counterfeit money before. After annoucing where their next heist will be Jigen gets rid of the bougs money by letting it fly out of the car as they are still driving down the highway. After many nights of camping out they finally made it to the Grand Duchy of Cagliostro, supposed origin of where the fake bills came from. They used fake IDs to get into the boarder, and as they drive through the place, Lupin tells Jigen about the location only for the Fiat 500 to get a flat tire. While performing Rock, Paper, Scissors Jigen ends up getting out the jack and fixes the flat.</p>",

At police headquarters the woman reveals that she has a list of names of foreign agents in the U.S. that she must get to Washington D.C., but that the enemies will stop at nothing to get ahold of the document. She is provided with a police escort, but when that's not enough, Superman swoops in!</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1751457\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.68493150684932\" data-width=\"584\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 584px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1751457\"><img alt=\"Opening Title of the 17th and final Superman animated short\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg 584w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Opening Title of the 17th and final Superman animated short\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg 584w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/52074/1751457-9148477_secretagnt.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Opening Title of the 17th and final Superman animated short</figcaption></figure>",

    "description": "<p><b>Part 1</b></p><p>John Jameson's son crash lands his space shuttle on the George Washington Bridge and Spider-Man saves him but later is attacked by the Rhino. When Peter gets home he sees on T.V that Spiderman is being framed by Eddie Brock for causing the mess in the first place. While Peter goes to sleep the symbiote consumes his anger. Once Peter wakes up he relizes that he is in a new and improved Spider-Man costume. Spider-Man goes to Jameson and says that Eddie Brock is lying. Later, he visits Doc Connors to talk to him about the suit. Connors says that its a symbiote and should destroy it. Spiderman leaves only to get into a fight with Shocker which Spider-Man gets the upper hand and almost kills him but thinks about what he's doing and goes and gets rid of the symbiote unkowning that Eddie Borck is under him and getting attached to the symbiote. When Spider-Man thinks he is free he gets attacked by Rhino and Shocker but blindly sees Venom defeating them both. Spider-Man sees Eddie Brock change to Venom and the fight a little. Another confrontation happens later in the episode where Spidey tricks Venom into fghting by a space shuttle and the noise is making the symbiote to let go. Spidey then webs the symbiote on to the shuttle. Eddie then is taken to custody and wants revenge for Spider-Man.</p><h3>Part 2</h3><p>The symbiote returns to Earth and travels to Ravencroft to reunite with Eddie Brock, who then escapes as Venom. He is ordered by Dormammu, to whom the symbiote owes its earthly return, to steal a machine from Stark Enterprises capable of releasing Dormammu from his own faroff dimension. When Venom battles Spider-Man and War Machine, he is easily defeated by the two heroes. Baron Mordo and Dormammu help Eddie Brock's cell-mate Cletus Kassidy bond with a symbiote, who later dubs himself Carnage. Carnage then assists Venom in his task to retrieve the technology from Stark Enterprises, though when Carnage attempts to destroy Spider-Man, Venom attacks him, telling him that the wall-crawler is Venom's and Venom's only.</p>",
