    "description": "<div class=\"js-item-cage\"></div><p>The queen of a kingdom was pregnant when she fell ill. The only cure was a magical flower. However, there was another woman, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76808\" href=\"/mother-gothel/4005-76808/\">Mother Gothel</a>, had been using the flower to preserve her youth. The newborn princess had golden hair with the power of the flower so Gothel kidnapped her and named her <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21237\" href=\"/rapunzel/4005-21237/\">Rapunzel</a>. Mother Gothel kept the girl locked away so no one else could see her. The king and queen searched for the princess, but couldn't find her. Every year on the princess's birthday they released floating lanterns into the sky in hopes she would see them and come home.</p><p>Rapunzel had always wanted to see the lights, so for her 18th birthday she asked Mother Gothel if they could go, but Mother Gothel said she could never leave the tower. In the meantime, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76806\" href=\"/flynn-rider/4005-76806/\">Flynn Rider</a>, a thief, and his two henchmen stole the princess's crown. They were pursued by guards lead by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76807\" href=\"/maximus/4005-76807/\">Maximus</a>, a horse. Flynn escaped to Rapunzel's tower, but betrayed his henchmen in the process. Rapunzel knocked Flynn out, hid the crown, sent her mother on a long errand, and before convincing Flynn to lead her to the lights. After a stop at The Cuddly Duckling (where Rapunzel inspired a group of ruffians to pursue their dreams), the two were caught and Rapunzel had use her magical hair to escape. Flynn began to trust her and revealed that his real name is Eugene Fitzherbert and he is a penniless orphan.</p><p>Mother Gothel returned early to the tower and found Rapunzel missing, so she went out to search for her and found her while Flynn is gone. Rapunzel wouldn't return home and believed that Flynn may be falling in love with her, but Mother Gothel reminds her that Flynn is only interested in the crown which she leaves with Rapunzel.</p><p>On their way to the kingdom, they met Maximus who agrees to postpone chasing Flynn for a day to help Rapunzel. They attended the festival associated with the lanterns, and at twilight Flynn takes them out in a boat to watch the lanterns above the kingdom. Rapunzel returned the crown, but Flynn set it aside and they almost kiss. However, Flynn, spotted his former henchmen on the shore and paddled in, he returned the crown to them, saying he has something better. The henchmen agreed: they wanted Rapunzel's magical hair as well. They knocked out Flynn and sent him adrift toward the castle with the stolen crown. Rapunzel saw him with the crown and felt betrayed. Mother Gothel knocked out the henchmen and took Rapunzel home.</p><p>Once home, Rapunzel looked around her room and noticed the symbol of the kingdom hidden in all her artwork and realizes she's the lost princess. Flynn is captured at the castle, but escaped with the help of Maximus and the ruffians Rapunzel had befriended. He went to the tower where he found Rapunzel chained as Mother Gothel tries to take her somewhere else. Gothel stabbed Flynn and Rapunzel agrees to go quietly if Gothel will let her heal Flynn. Rapunzel began to heal him, but Flynn cut off her hair to free her. Mother Gothel dies and turns to dust without the power of the hair, and Flynn dies from his injuries. Rapunzel cried over him, and the tear restored him. Rapunzel, now a brunette, reunited with her family and the kingdom rejoiced.</p>",

A stranger with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford). It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been... Written by Universal Pictures.</i></p> <i>  </i>",

It is being directed Marc Webb and stars Andrew Garfield as the web swinger, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, and Rhys Ifans as The Lizard.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>When Spider-Man 4 was cancelled, a rebooted Spider-Man film was announced with a new director and a new cast. It was intended to be a much closer adaptation of the comics than the previous series was. The film was supposed to be closer to the Ultimate Spider-Man comics rather than the mainstream Amazing Spider-Man comics despite it's misleading name.</p><h2>Production</h2><h3>Pre-Production</h3><p>In May 2010, five actors were in the running for the lead of Peter Parker. They were Jamie Bell, Josh Hutcherson, Frank Dillane, Alden Ehrenreich, and Andrew Garfield. In June, the list had supposedly to include Aaron Johnson and Anton Yelchin. The final shortlist was rumored to include Logan Lerman and Michael Angarano. On June 27, Columbia confirmed that the final shortlist would be: Jamie Bell, Anton Yelchin, Aaron Johnson, Andrew Garfield, Logan Lerman, and Alden Ehrenreich. It was announced on July 1, that Andrew Garfield was cast as Peter Parker. The fact that Andrew Garfield was 27 at the time caused quite a stir with fans, questioning whether or not Garfield could play a high school student. Websites reported that Sony thought about that and changed him to a college student instead. Though Entertainment Weekly reported that the film would still be set in High School.</p><h2>Movie Based Comics</h2><p><a href=\"/amazing-spider-man-movie/4050-49594/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-49594\">Amazing Spider-Man Movie</a></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>\"Warner Bros. Pictures’ and Legendary Pictures’ The Dark Knight Rises is the epic conclusion to filmmaker Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy. It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.\"</em></p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Loosely inspired by story-lines such as \"<a href=\"/knightfall/4045-40761/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40761\">Knightfall</a>\", \"<a href=\"/the-dark-knight-returns/4045-55703/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55703\">The Dark Knight Returns</a>\", \"<a href=\"/batman-cataclysm/4045-42229/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42229\">Cataclysm</a>\", \"Legacy\" and \"<a href=\"/no-mans-land/4045-42106/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42106\">No Man's Land</a>\", the conclusion of The Dark Knight Trilogy pits a retired Bruce Wayne against a new breed of terrorist, who threatens to shatter the very fabric of Gotham City and bring the world to it's knees. Allied with a rookie cop and the sly Catwoman, Batman must break free of the shackles of his past and give his all to stop Bane, a beefed up criminal mastermind with sinister connections to old enemies, and someone close to Bruce Wayne himself.</p>",

    "description": "<p> <em>The Doctor is returning home to Gallifrey with the remains of his arch-nemesis, the Master. Forced off course, the TARDIS arrives in San Fancisco on New Year's Eve 1999, where the Doctor is critically wounded in a gangland gun battle. At the local hospital, Dr. Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook) fights - and fails - to save his life. </em></p><p><em>Later in the morgue, the Doctor wakes up a new man. But he is not the only one - the Master has also found himself a new body. As the clock counts down to the start of the new millennium, can the Doctor stop his oldest enemy destroying all life on earth. </em></p><p> </p><h4>Plot (contains spoilers)</h4><p>The Master has been exterminated by the <a href=\"/daleks/4060-59037/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59037\">Daleks</a> on Skaro and the 7th Doctor agrees to take him back to his home-planet Gallifrey in a locked box where the Master exists in a shapeless mucus like form. He manages to crash the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/tardis/4055-55682/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55682\">TARDIS</a> on New Year's Eve 1999 in San Francisco. When the Doctor emerges from the TARDIS in the middle of a gang war and get's shot, he's brought to the hospital by one of the gang-bangers called Chang Lee who consequently tries to steal his belongings. </p><p>The resident surgeon Dr. Grace Holloway tries to save the Doctor but is actually instrumental in killing him. The Doctor regenerates in the morgue and emerges as the 8th Doctor. A side effect of the regeneration is that he loses his memory. Meanwhile the Master has taken physical form again by taking over the body of the ambulance driver called Bruce. His ultimate goal is to inhabit that of the Doctor's because he doesn't last long in human form. </p><p>The Master takes control of the TARDIS and the Doctor finally remembers who he is and convinces Dr. Grace Holloway he is who he says he is. Together the prevent the Master's plan to destroy the Earth and keep him from taking over the Doctor's body. The Doctor says goodbye to his new found friends and sits down in the armchair in the TARDIS just as the world celebrates the new millennium. His last words, as the record player gets stuck in a groove again (it also did so at the beginning of the movie): \"Oh no, not again!\"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "deck": "Ash, Dawn and Brock travel to Alamos Town to partake in a Pokemon Contest they find out that something is wrong in the peaceful town. Turns out the Time/Space continuum is being warped around the town, and people are blaming the shadowy Pokemon, Darkrai. But is Darkrai truly to blame?",
    "description": "<p>On there way to Alamos Town for a Pokemon Contest, Ash, Dawn and Brock meet a girl named Alice and her Chimchar. Alice runs a hot-air balloon tour of Alamos. While Alice is showing Ash and his friends around, Alice's friend Tonio is seen sitting in his lab reading the dairy of his great grandfather, Godey. The dairy tells of a great disaster that will befall Alimos Town, it also tells of Alice's grandmother, Alicia, in the great garden and how she had met and befriended Darkrai, by playing the song 'Oracion' on a leaf whistle. <br />Taking a break from their tour Ash and his friends participate in a battle against three trainers and their Torterra, Infernape and Empoleon. Alice finishes her tour by showing Ash, Dawn and Brock the garden in which her Grandmother used to play in. Ash and his friends let their Pokemon out of their PokeBalls to allow them to play in the garden, however it wasn't long before a fight broke out between the trainers' Pokemon and a group of wild Pokemon over some berries. In order to break up the fight and calm the Pokemon down Alice plays Oracion on a leaf whistle of her own. Amazed by what had happened Ash, Dawn and Brock stare at Alice. Alice then goes on to explain the the song she played has some mystic property that can calm even the most savage of raging Pokemon. Suddenly a Gallade appears urging Alice to see a part of the garden that had seemingly been destroyed where they meet Tonio. As the group were investigating a man named Baron Alberto arrived declaring that the destruction was caused by the 'evil' Darkrai. Then from the shadows Darkrai emerged warning them to leave, however Baron Alberto orders his Lickilicky to attack. In retaliation Darkrai creates an attack of his own which accidentally hits Ash, who immediately blacks out.   <br />Meanwhile in an alternate dimension a fierce battle rages between two legendary Dragon Pokemon, Palkia and Dialga.   <br />In a nightmare Ash dreams that Pikachu is great danger before he is awoken by his real Pikachu with a thundershock.  When Ash awakens Tonio explains how the Time/Space continuum around Alamos Town is being affected some how. Still convinced that Darkrai was the cause Baron Alberto rallies the Pokemon Trainers of the town, including Jessie, James and Meowth of Team Rocket, to put an end to the Dark Pokemon's reign. Ash and his friends however do not follow the Baron as they choice to listen to Tonio who doesn't believe Darkrai is to blame. Tonio believes Darkrai is truly good as he witnessed the pokemon save Alice when she was a child.  <br />  Tonio explains that the Space/Time distortion is caused from the spiritual images of the sleeping Pokemon was made by a multidimensional disturbance from when the legendary Palkia entered the realm. As the day went on Baron Antonio's hunt continued and in the battle that followed many trainers' Pokemon were KOed, but due to a side-affect of the warped reality astral images of the KOed Pokemon began running around the town. Along with this unforeseen circumstance Baron Alberto also suffered a strange side-affect as his body turned into that of a Lickilicky.  <br />Darkrai locates Palkia who was hiding invisibly by the towns bell tower and proceeds to attack, as Darkrai knows Palkia is the true cause of the Space/Time abnormality.  Seeing Palkia and the arrival of Dialga, Tonio realizes that this is the disaster that his great-grandfather's dairy tells of. As the two dragons wage war the reality around the town begins to tear apart at an increased rate. Darkrai attempts to intervene in Palkia's and Dialga's battle and seemingly is able to hold his own against the two behemoths. While Darkrai fends off the dragons' attacks the entire town evacuates to the seemingly safest place in the town, the great garden. After rereading the dairy Tonio thinks of a plan, the bell tower has a music disk that plays Oracion, stating that Oracion   is the song that could soothe even the fiercest rage. Brock stays in the park to help ward of the dragons' attacks while Ash, Pikachu, Dawn, Alice and Tomio race to the Bell tower to put the plan in action. The increased power of Palkia and Dialga has now caused the reality around Alamos to literally begin to vanish. Ash and friends reach the tower but only Ash, Pikachu and Dawn are able to make it inside as the tower begins to disappear right before them, Alice and Tonio manage to get away via hot-air balloon. racing up the bell tower with it vanishing under their feet Ash and Dawn manage to reach the top with the help of their Pokemon. Finding the music disk they need Ash and Dawn run into one more problem, the tower no longer has any power. <br />Outside both Palkia and Dialga grow more and more agitated and upon unleashing an attack that would have destroyed Alomos, Darkrai sacrifices himself in order to save the town. Witnessing this Alice bursts into tears leaning on Tonio for comfort.  Baron Alberto who had finally reverted back to his true body also witnessed Darkrai's sacrifice and now knew that the Pokemon was not the cause of the towns problems. <br />Back inside the Bell Tower Ash and Dawn mangaed to jump start the tower's mechanics with the help of Pikachu and Pachirisu. As the melody of Oracion rang out through the town almost magically Dialga and Palkia calmed down. Dialga then leaves for it's own dimension and the town slowly begins to reappear into reality. As Palkia is about to leave he is Stopped by Ash, Dawn and Alice who begin to yell at the mighty dragon for being the cause of the death of the brave Darkrai. Palkia saw the sorrow within Alice and let out a roar. In a flash of bright light Palkia disapears.<br />At dusk the towns people thank the seemingly passed Darkrai and respect for everything he had done for Alamos Town. As tears form in the eyes of Alice, Dawn and Ash a great shadow is cast from atop of the Bell Tower. Everyone looks up to see the shadowy guardian of Alamos Town stand heroically atop the tower, Darkrai lives! <br />The following day the Alamos Pokemon Contest begins, in which Dawn participates.</p>",
