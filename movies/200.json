    "description": "<p>The Allied Nations has managed to enter the country of Shadaloo to take down the armed forces of a general named M. Bison. Bison has captured several dozen hostages who are held to their own wills. During a negotation between Bison and Allied Nations' commander Guile, Bison demands a ransom of $20 billion dollars in American money within three days or the hostages will die and the Allied Nations will be blamed for their deaths. Guile's assistant named Cammy as only able to trace a little bit of Bison's signal from a river delta region outside of Shadaloo City. One of the hostages is a man named Carlos Blanka, a peacekeeper and a friend of Guile's. Blanka ends up being a test subject for Bison's mutated soldier project. If the project is successful it can lead Bison to create a whole army of powerful soldiers to conquor the world. Upon the experiment, Blanka is placed in an incubator where he is forced to watch horrific images that will make him become a mindless beast with no fear. The captured scientist in charge of the project Dr. Dhalsim, decided to ruin Bison's plans for an ultimate army by treaking the brain washing system in order to allow Blanka to retain his humanity.</p><p>Meanwhile at an underground area, Ryu &amp; Ken attempted to sell fake arms to the Shadaloo crime syndicate's leader Viktor Sagat. Who plans to have both con artists killed by having them fight his prized fighter Vega. This plan was nixed when Guile enters the building and takes everyone into custody for violating curfew. When seeing Ryu and Ken fighting Sagat's guards, Guile asked them to help him out in taking down Sagat's gang and fake Guile's own death. This plan hits nerve on a news reporter named Chun-Li who is seeking revenge towards M. Bison for the death of her father. Her friends E. Honda &amp; Balrog have a bone to pick with Sagat. They attempted to kill Bison and Sagat with a truck bomb, which destroyed most of Bison's arms storage but the dictator still lives. Ken &amp; Ryu who are undercover as new henchmen turn against Chun-Li in order to gain trust from M. Bison so that way they can be lead to the hideout. As long as they have their tracking devices on them, Guile and the Allied Nations can pin point the location of the dictator's hideout.</p><p>Once they were invited into the hideout which turns out to be located under a Cambodian temple, Ken &amp; Ryu freed Honda and Balrog from their prison. Now a team of four seek out to find Chun-Li. Chun-Li was being held in Bison's private quarters where she attempts to fight him and finally fullfill her goal. That goal however was cut off when Ryu and the other interutted her long enough for Bison to make an escape. The room was sealed and gas was starting to fill it in attempts to kill them. Back at the Allied Nations' base, Guile managed to pinpoint Ryu and Ken's location which is where they'll find M. Bison's hideout. Since an air strike is no match for the hideout's air-defences, Guile orders a platoon of combat boats to take on the hideout by river. However a group of peace negotiators inform Guile that there's no need for an invasion when the ransom is about ready to be given to M. Bison. Guile protests this decision as he sees this situation to be too good to back out on so he rallies his most trusted comrades on his own to the hideout.</p><p>Guile along with Cammy and Hawk head up the river using a weapons system to take down the defense radar that was planted by Bison's forces. Bison detects the speed boat and activates a mine to blow it up. The explosion nearly missed the three soldiers as they safely made it to the hideout. Guile gets ambushed by the now mutated Blanka who ten suddenly recognizes Guile as his friend. Guile was prepared to kill Blanka to end his suffering rather than living his whole life as a freak of nature. However Dr. Dhalsim intervene and adviced him to not kill Blanka and Guile complied to the good doctor's wishes to not kill his best friend. At the same time, the 72 hour time limit had just ended andafter Bison learns that the ransom money has not been delivered he proceeded in the killing of the hostages. After learning from the doctor that Blanka was meant to kill the hostages, Guile enters the elevated chamber that was ment for Blanka and was hoist up to the command center where he is now face to face with Bison. At the same time, a platoon of Allied Nations combat boats have arrived and started a battle against Bison's army. Ken was about to leave the battle, but decided to save Ryu from an ambush and the two ended up in a fight against Sagat and Vega. They triumph in the battle with both Sagat and Vega defeated.</p><p>During Guile and Bison's personal duel, Bison knocked off at a bank of hard drives, only for Guile to learn that Bison's suit is powdered with electromagnetism allowing him to shoot bolts of lightning giving Guile a harder time to fight. Bison attempts to give Guile a fatal blow, Guile manages to pull off a well-timed roadhouse kick which sends M. Bison crashing into a giant monitor screen. Resulting in a gigantic explosion which destroyed the power source of the hideout allowing the hostages to be freed and were guide out of the base safely. Guile tries to convince the doctor and Blanka to escape with him but Blanka felt there is no place for him i nthe outside world. While the doctor who is responsible for Blanka's mutation decided to keep Blanka company until the end. With the temple crumbling down everyone believed that Guile is dead, only to see him escape from the collapsing hideout. After being reunited with his friends, they all gave out their winning poses as the last structure of the temples falls downs.</p><p>Just as the whole crisis seem to have ended, the main computer in Bison's now ruined hideout is displaying it's own batteries being recharged from solar energy. The computer uses a heart restarter on the presumably dead Bison. This process keeps going until Bison is alive enough to punch his fist through the rumble. While on the computer screen, the option labeled World Domination: Replay was selected. Hinting that this isn't the last time the Allied Nations have heard from M. Bison.</p>",

During a steak out she listens to a conversation between a property holder and Balroq one of M. Bison's men about allowing a shipment of \"White rose\" to be delivered at the docks. Later that night, Chun-Li enters a night club and confronts M. Bison's secretary: Cantana. She obtains the info she needed on White Rose and escaped from the charging Shadaloo thugs and Maya &amp; Nash. After the incident Cantana received punishment from M. Bison by being used as his punching bag. Chun-Li returns to Gen to learn about M. Bison's origin. Bison was the son of Irish missionaries, grew up orphaned and spent his whole life as a thief. Years later in a means of becoming pure evil Bison killed his pregnant wife and transferred his conscious into his prematurely born daughter. After chun-Li left for some sopping errands, Gen was attacked by Shadaloo thugs and then his whole home was blown up by Balroq's RPG. While Chun-Li ended up being pursued by Vega another Bison henchman whom she defeated by leaving him hanging on the side of a building.</p><p>The next day Chun-Li searchs for answers from a harbor employee on the shipment of White Rose. She returns to the shipping yard that night only to fall for M. Bison's trap. She then finds herself tied up and brought to an undisclosed house where she is reunited with her father. The reunion was cut short when Bison snapped Xiang's neck and he died on the spot. After Bison and Balroq left the house, Chun-Li used her martial arts skills to knock out the guards and make her escape. Upon escaping Balroq attempted to shoot her down only to have shot her arm. Now reunited with Gen who heals Chun-Li's wounds and gives her more training. Despite that Nash is no longer on the Shadaloo case, he was secretly asked by Chun-Li to back her up on taking down M. Bison. Nash, Chun-Li, Maya, &amp; a SWAT team arrived at the shipping yard only to find themselves in a middle of a shoot out by the Shadaloo company. Maya got wounded in the battle, but her SWAT team managed to triumph against all odds.</p><p>Chun-Li enters a docke ship to find Bison, upon her search she sees a girl speaking Russian whom she just left her as she was cause Chun-Li believe the girl is no threat to her. On the other side of the ship Gen is in a fight against Balroq. The fight ends with Balroq being impaled with a nitrogen pipe. Bison takes the Russian speaking girl who he mentions is his own daughter named Rose. The shipment of White Rose turn out to be refering to M. Bison daughter the whoel time. He flees with Rose to a helicopter hoping to escape. Chun-Li and the allies head over to Shadaloo headquarters, Nash takes Rose out to safety while Chun-Li and Gen fight against Bison. After a long battle Chun-Li hits Bison with a bamboo pole and dropped sandbags on him leaving him in a stunned state. She then twisted his neck and fires a Krikoken sending his body off of a scaffold. Nash informs Chun-Li to leave the scene before the police arrive which she did. Now home again in Hong Kong, Chun-Li receives a visit by Gen himself who shows her a newspaper advertising a <em>Street Fight</em> tournament. After he informs her of a skill opponent named Ryu, Chun-Li declines the offer to enter as she would rather spend some time at home instead of entering a tournament.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The movie begins with a gangster named Tony Montana being interrogated by politicians about his life. Because of a tattoo he has in his arm, they send Tony, along with his best friend and Army buddy, Manny Ribera, to Freedom Town, a prison for those who have no green cards. <br />Â <br />While there, Manny tells Tony of a news that someone will release him and Manny, but on one condition: kill Emilio Rebenga. One day, Tony kills Rebenga with stab to the stomach. Afterwards, he and Manny are released. <br />Â <br />In the night, they get a job as dish washers in a hut. They got into a deal with Omar Suarez, Frank Lopez's henchman, about getting a lot of money from a deal with Hector the Toad. Tony is shown to have strong dislike to Omar and reluctantly agrees to take the job. He tells Manny that he dislikes Columbians. <br />Â <br />The next day, Tony, along with his friend, Angel Fernandez, goes to a hotel to meet with Hector. However, the deal goes sour and Angel is killed by Hector. Manny and Chi Chi arrive and rescue Tony and enraged over losing Angel, he kills Hector with one shot in the head and escapes with the money and drugs. <br />Â <br />Tony and Manny go to Frank's house to deliver him the money and drugs. Impressed by this, Frank begins to distrust Omar, thinking he is in Hector's side or he doesn't know that Hector is a double-crosser. They go to the Babylonian Club afterwards. <br />Â <br />Inside the club, Frank begins to teach Tony about how to be a drug dealer. While driving, Tony tells Manny about how he could own the world and everything in it. <br />Â <br />2 months later, Tony visits his estrange family consist of his mother and sister, Gina. Although Gina is happy to see him, Mrs. Montana is not because she is aware of Tony's criminal activities. When Tony gives her money, she rejects it and orders Tony to leave, never again returning. However, Gina goes to Tony and tells him that the main cause of their mother's behavior is because their father left them. Tony gives Gina the money and they kissed. When Manny talks about Gina, Tony warns him not to have a relationship with her. <br />Â <br />Someday at Bolivia, Tony and Omar meet drug kingpin Alejandro Sosa as he gives them a tour to his drug factory. They have lunch at Sosa's mansion afterwards. While discussing of the distribution, Tony and Omar got into an argument. Sosa offers to take Omar back home by helicopter. <br />Â <br />Tony is amazed that Sosa has everything he has and Sosa admits that he likes him and it is not a lie. Unfortunately, Sosa can't say the same thing for the rest of Tony's organization. When Tony asks him about that, Sosa is talking about Omar, whom he reveals that he is an alleged informer for the police and hangs him for putting gangsters away in jail for life. Tony tells to Sosa that he really hates Omar because he thinks he's responsible for the death of Angel. Amazed by this, Sosa tells Tony that he will have a good business relationship with him, but with one condition: don't double-cross him. <br />Â <br />Back at Miami, Frank is upset that Tony has made a deal with Sosa in his own. Because of that, they end their business relationship. Afterwards, Tony proposes to Frank's mistress, Elvira Hancock, into marrying him. <br />Â <br />In one night at the Babylonian Club, Tony gets shaken by corrupt cop, Mel Bernstein, whom he knows that Frank sends him into shaking Tony up. After the conversation, Tony sees a man trying to have sex with Gina and enraged by it, attacks the man. He berates Gina for that and she is slapped by Tony. Manny is disappointed by that and tries to comfort Gina. <br />Â <br />While Tony is watching a comedy shown by a mascot, Manny tries to comfort Gina about Tony and reluctantly gets into a relationship with her. <br />Â <br />Meanwhile, Tony is attacked by two gangsters. He manages to take them out and escape. <br />Â <br />Tony and the gang visit Frank, who reveals that he ordered the two men to kill Tony. He tells the latter to spare him, but Tony refuses and Manny kills him. Tony kills Bernstein and offers Ernie with a job. <br />Â <br />Since then, Tony owns a mansion, buy a hair salon for Gina, and marries Elvira. What he didn't know is that Manny and Gina are having a relationship behind his back. However, Tony becomes paranoid and becomes distant to those around him. <br />Â <br />While he is laundering money, Tony is arrested by the police for tax evasion. Luckily, he is released by George Sheffield, his lawyer. <br />Â <br />Tony goes to Bolivia to do some work with Sosa. The latter introduces Tony the leaders of Bolivia. He shows Tony a video about a journalist who tries to reveal Sosa to the world. Sosa will try to help Tony with his prison problem, but only if he kills the journalist. <br />Â <br />In one night at a restaurant, Tony and Elvira got into a fight and become distant to each other. <br />Â <br />In the night at New York City, Tony has planted a bomb to the journalist's car. At the morning, Tony sees the journalist has bought his wife and kids with him to the meeting. Because of that, he refuses to kill the journalist, but Alberto, Sosa's hitman insists to kill also the wife and kids. Enraged that Alberto is about to activate the bomb, Tony kills him. <br />Â <br />When Tony comes calling for Manny, he is not in the mansion. Nick also reveals that Tony's mother is calling him about Gina. <br />Â <br />By the time he gets back to the mansion, Tony gets into an argument with Sosa about failing to kill the journalist. Sosa even warns him not to double-cross him. When Tony shouts about having war with him, Sosa puts the phone down. <br />Â <br />At his mother's house, Tony is told that Gina is living at a house of her own. When Tony gets there, Manny answers the door and Gina appears. Enraged that Manny has slept with his sister, Tony kills him and Gina sadly reveals that they're married. He takes her to his mansion. <br />Â <br />In his mansion, Tony plans to have war with Sosa. However, what he didn't know is that Sosa's army is attacking his men. <br />Â <br />Meanwhile, Gina goes to him and thinks that Tony is jealous with all of the men that comes near to her. She pulls out a gun, begging Tony to have sex with her. Gina manages to shoot Tony in the leg and is killed by one of Sosa's men. Tony kills him afterwards. <br />Â <br />Nick warns Tony to get out of the mansion since Sosa's army is attacking him. Just as Tony is about to prepare his weapons, he sees Gina dead. He begins to have remorse for killing Manny and for making her sad. <br />Â <br />Chi Chi is killed by one of Sosa's men. Tony prepares his weapon, M14 with a M203 grenade launcher, and blasts the door, yelling \"Say hello to my little friend\". He begins to shoot Sosa's gang, but he got shot while doing so. What Tony didn't notice is that the Skull is behind him. Tony gets shot repeatedly until the Skull kills him with one shot at the back and falls into the fountain.</p>",

Lex plans to use the radium to manufacture synthetic kryptonite. Clark scoops Lois on the story and so Perry White sends Clark to cover the Atom Man vs. Superman story. Also, Luthor reveals why he knows so much about Superman and kryptonite.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Episode 8: 'Into the Empty Doom!'; Superman has been captured by Atom Man's men, and is sent into the 'empty doom'. Perry White notices the simultaneous disappearance of Clark Kent, and theorizes that the two men are the same. White orders Lois Lane to print the story, but Lois and Jimmy decide that whether or not Clark was Superman, the story shouldn't be published, and they scheme to prevent it. Meanwhile, Superman has become incorporeal; unable to affect the physical world.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Episode 9: 'Superman Crashes Through' has Superman stuck in the Empty Doom, but he manages to get a message to the Daily Planet via Lois' electric typewriter. By arranging for a TV station to show archive footage of Superman in action, Superman and the Planet staff conspire to convince Atom Man that Superman has escaped from the Empty Doom. When Atom Man beams a henchman there to check on Superman, Superman follows the beam back to Earth.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Episode 10: 'Atom Man's Heat Ray' Superman has to save both Lois and Jimmy from trouble they get themselves into while pursuing hold-up men. Lois reports back to Luthor that the robbers seem to strike wherever their TV truck is distracting people. Luthor plans to deal with the hold-up men to help clear his name. Lois then reports back to Clark and Jimmy that she believes Luthor is on the level, but Clark remains unconvinced.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Episode 11: 'Luthor's Strategy' has Luthor throwing the suspicious off his trail by holding a press conference to announce his plans to stop Atom Man; a conference that is interrupted by threats from Atom Man. Following the press conference, the Daily Planet staff (and Lois, in her role as TV reporter), are sent upstate to cover a flood.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Episode 12: 'Atom Man Strikes!' has Lois Lane taking unnecessary risks in covering the flood, and Superman must rescue her. In so doing, Superman and Lois discover the hidden compartment in Luthor's TV truck. Now that they are onto him, Luthor orders the Daily Planet (and Superman, of course), eliminated.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Episode 13: 'Atom Man's Flying Saucers' begins with Luthor's men attacking <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-daily-planet/4055-57952/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57952\">The Daily Planet</a> offices. Clark changes to Superman and takes on the heat beam they are using head on. It's almost too much for him but when he falls into an electrical transformer he's revived, though not in enough time to apprehend the perpetrators. Lois, Jimmy and the police tail the truck out of town but again the henchmen escape. Luthor now knowing he's under suspicion reveals his final battle plan.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Episode 14: 'Rocket of Vengeance' opens with Clark and Lois in a small plane about to collide with Luthor's flying saucer. Lois faints, which gives Clark time to change to Superman, fly her down to the ground and change back to Clark. Meanwhile, Luthor makes a radio announcement to the Metropolis Chief of Police, stating that he will destroy the city if the search for him is not called off.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Episode 15: 'Superman Saves the Universe' concludes the series. Superman saves the Daily Planet from a missile strike by Luthor, but Luthor then takes Lois Lane hostage and causes a large earthquake to hit Metropolis' east side. Then he makes his escape from Earth itself, with Lois as hostage, and Superman in hot pursuit.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Reception</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Jim Harman and Donald F. Glut book <ins>The Great Movie Serials</ins> maintains that despite some improvements, the Superman flight sequences are still the weakest part of the production and accuses <em>Atom Man vs. Superman</em> of being \"flawed by the same Katzman cheapness\" while additionally being \"far more gimmicky and gadget prone\" than the first Superman serial.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Trivia</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">An interesting bit of trivia: 'Henchman Dorr' was played by an actor named <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wally-west/4005-23879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\">Wally West</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This was reportedly the highest grossing Republic serial of all time.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Lyle Talbot's face was the model for Lex Luthor in the comics until the 1960s.</p>",

    "description": "<i>The mad Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) , the tormented Dr. Can Cain (Bruce Abbott), and the beheaded Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) return in this terrifying sequel to Re-Animator, the most deliriously outrageous horror movie of the decade. <br/>Â <br/>It's been eight months since the Miskatonic Massacre stained the halls with blood -- and Dr. West and Dr Cain's experiments have taken a bizarre turn. Now they have gone beyond re-animating the dead... into the realm of creating new life. The legs of a hooker and the womb of a virgin are joined to the heart of Dr. Cain's dead girlfriend -- and the bride is unleashed upon her mate in a climax of sensual horror.<br/></i>",

Believing her son dead and blaming anyone who claimed the title of camp councilor she begins to pick off the teenage group one by one until she has narrowed it down the last, Alice. Once she has Alice running in fear Mrs. Voorhees reveals herself as the killer. After a long chase through the camp Mrs. Voorhees corners Alice near the docks of lake, in an attempt to prevent her from running Mrs. Voorhees exclaims about how it would be easier for Alice than it was for Jason, and that it was her fault he drowned she should have been watching him. Just as Mrs. Voorhees attempts to stab Alice with a knife the young camp councilor grabs the machete (that would eventually become the infamous weapon of choice in the later films) and cuts off Mrs. Voorhees head. (Later it is discovered that Jason was in fact still alive and witnessed his mother being beheaded.) Alice then drops the machete and climbs into a canoe and floats into the middle of the lake. When she awakes she sees police vehicles in the distance heading towards the camp suddenly a young boy (Jason Voorhees) jumps from the lake and pulls her into the water. Eventually Alice comes to on land and the police inform her she is the only survivor. When she ask about the about the boy the police tell her that there was no boy and tell her that she must have been dreaming......</p>",
