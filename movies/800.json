However, she finds herself restrained by strict protocols and the elitism with which even the palace staff treats people of humble background. Like herself. She tries to include peasants in palace festivities and make changes for the better.  <br /> <br />In \"Tall Tail\", Jaq is resentful of his small size  preventing him from effectively helping Cinderella in her new life. The Fairy Godmother temporarily changes him into a human. He is no more real help and misses his own  love interest.  <br /> <br />In \"An Uncommon Romance\", Anastasia has fallen in love with a baker, a decent man but beneath her social station. She has to defy her mother Lady Tremaine and sister Drizella to find happiness. Only her stepsister Cinderella is willing to help her. In a subplot, Lucifer is himself in love with Pom Pom, a snobbish palace cat. The mice are trying to play matchmakers, hoping it would distruct the two vicious cats from hunting them.  <br /> <br />The movie was mostly rejected by critics but sold extremely well for a straight-to-video release. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Darren Shan (who shares a name with the book’s writer) is an ordinary teenager with an ordinary family who with not-so-ordinary classmate Steve Leopard (Josh Hutcherson of <i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i>). Steve tries to distract himself from his abusive family by obsessing over vampires, but when that doesn’t work he cuts class and vandalises the school building. Still he is Shan’s (secret) best friend, so the two of them are excited for a night at the Cirque Du Freak. Unfortunately, Darren recently joined Steve on one of those afore-mentioned school day escapades, so he is grounded and banned from speaking to Leopard. In spite of the rule, the two hop on their bikes one fateful night and go to the show. It is far better than they expected—the Freaks seem like they are really magic. Darren is a little upset though when he finds out Steve thinks the circus spider-tamer Mr. Crepsley is a real vampire. He is more surprised when he overhears Crepsley admitting to really being a vampire seconds before Steve bursts in and asks to become one as well. Crepsley denies Steve those abilities, though, saying he would abuse them. However, the next day Steve is bitten by Crepsley’s spider, all because Darren stole it. Crepsley agrees to save Steve under one condition—Darren becomes a vampire and serves as Crepsley’s assistant in the job that Steve had dreamed of.

    "description": "<p>The Muses tell the audience a story of the hero, Hercules.</p><p>One day, in Mount Olyumpus, the Greek gods and goddesses are celebrating the birth of Zeus and Hera's son, Hercules. Just then, Hades, the Lord of the Underworld, is not happy about it and is jealous of Zeus ruling everything that he wishes to overthrow him.</p><p>In the underworld, Hades gets into contact with the Fates, who tell him of a history that in 18 years later, the Titans, whom Zeus imprisoned, will be free and cause chaos. Unfortunately, there is only one who can stop them and is Hercules. Hades gets enraged by that kid of news.</p><p>He takes his two henchmen, Pain and Panic, to a chamber and asks them how to kill a god. They reply that they can kill a god if he/she is not immortal. Hades gets a potion and orders them to give Hercules a douse of it.</p><p>In the night at Mount Olympus, the baby Hercules gets abducted by Pain and Panic and they take him to the mountains. They give him the douse of the potion, but is not finished. Because of this, Hercules uses his strength to throw Pain and Panic off. The latter fears that Hades will get mad that they failed, but the former convinces him not to worry because he doesn't know about it. A farmer and his wife decided to adopt Hercules as their son.</p><p>Back at Mount Olympus, Zeus and Hera are saddened by the news of their son being abducted.</p><p>18 years later, Hercules is shown going to a marketplace with the farmer. However, his strength leads him to accidentally knocking the place and the people are not liking it.</p><p>At the afternoon, Hercules asks his foster parents about where he truly belongs and they give him a medallion he has since he was a baby. In the night, he goes to the Temple of Zeus. Upon going there, a statue of Zeus comes to life and is happy to be reunited with Hercules. He gets his him reunited with his pet horse, Pegasus and tells him that in order to be with him and the other gods and goddesses, he must be a hero trained under Philoctetes.</p><p>The next morning, Hercules goes to an island where he met Philoctetes, or Phil for short. He orders to be trained, but Phil refuses because he retires. Upon being told that Hercules' father is Zeus, Phil still refuses to train, but is struck by lightning by Zeus, giving him no other choice.</p><p>After training him, Hercules and Phil go to a forest where they see a woman named Meg getting into trouble with a centaur named Nessus. He beats him up and begins to fall in love with her, much to the dismay from Phil and Pegasus.</p><p>Meg meets up with Hades, and it is revealed that she sold her soul to him in order to be with the man she loved, but he left her with another woman. He asked her who beat Nessus up, and she replies that it is Hercules who done it. Hades is angered that Pain and Panic are hiding the truth from him and swears to get him so that he can't stop the Titans.</p><p>In the city of Thebes, Hercules tries to get respect from the people, but to no avail. Just then, a monster known as the Hydra comes and Hercules fights it. He defeats it and is respected by everyone, angering Hades in the process.</p><p>Since then, Hercules is treated as a celebrity thanks to Hades keep sending him monsters to defeat him.</p><p>Hades is getting irritated by this and orders Meg to find Hercules' weakness. In the night, Zeus tells Hercules that even though he is treated as a celebrity, he is not a true hero.</p><p>One night, Hercules and Meg are on a date when Phil and Pegasus interrupt in order to get the former trained. While trying to get Hercules to focus, he is knocked out.</p><p>After getting a flower, Meg tries to deny that she is falling in love with Hercules, but the Muses encourage her to admit her true feelings. Just then, Hades arrives to remind Meg that she works for him and has found out Hercules' weakness. Phil wakes up to find out Meg's secret and runs to warn Hercules.</p><p>In a coliseum, he tries to warn Hercules about Meg, but he refuses to believe such fact. When he throws a dumbbell to Phil, he leaves. Just then, Hades appears and shows Hercules that he has captured Meg and the only way to let her go is to make a deal of losing his powers for 24 hours. Hercules reluctantly agrees, but on one condition that Meg must not be harmed. After losing his powers, Hades throws a dumbbell at Hercules and decided to show him his secret about Meg.</p><p>He releases her, telling her that she is off with him. Hades reveals to Hercules that Meg is working for him all this time, but he thinks that he is lying. That is, until Pain and Panic has confirm it to him. Meg tries to apologize, but Hercules is saddened by her treachery.</p><p>Hades goes to the river to release the Titans and orders them to kill Zeus. When they are going the wrong way, Hades shows the Titans the way to Mount Olympus, and orders one of the the Cyclops to get rid of Hercules.</p><p>In the city of Thebes, the Cyclops causes chaos through town in order to lure Hercules into a trap. Hercules goes to confront him, but Meg warns him that without his strength, he will be killed. Hercules refuses to listen to her and goes to confront the Cyclops, which resulting in getting himself beaten up.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Titans has defeated the gods and goddesses.</p><p>Meg frees Pegasus and tries to convince Phil to go and help Hercules. She admits that it is all her fault that he lost his powers and persuades Phil to help because if he doesn't, Hercules will die.</p><p>Zeus orders to get more thunderbolts, but is captured and discovers that Hades is behind the entire plot.</p><p>Phil arrives to encourage Hercules to fight back. He fights the Cyclops with his brains and defeats him. When a pillar is about to fall on him, Meg gets in the way, only for her to get crushed. This results in Hades' deal to be broken and Hercules getting his powers back.</p><p>He goes to Mount Olympus to defeat the Titans. However, Hades tells him that Meg will be killed by the crushing of the pillar. By the time Hercules goes to her, she dies. However, Hercules states that he can save her.</p><p>In the underworld, Hades is angered that Hercules has foiled his plot. Just then, Hercules arrives and orders his uncle to get Meg back. Hades shows him the River Styx, a river where the souls of the dead are. When Hercules tries to get Meg's soul, his hands suddenly ages.</p><p>Hercules makes a deal with Hades that he will give up his own life to save Meg. He manages to save her, and because of his sacrifice, he becomes a god. He punches Hades to the river and the souls began to torment him. Panic is so afraid about getting into trouble, but Pain convinces him that there is nothing to worry as long as Hades is in the river.</p><p>Hercules gets Meg's soul back to her body, reviving her. He, along with his friends, go to Mount Olympus where he is reunited with the gods and goddesses, including his father and mother. Because Meg is sad about leaving her, Hercules decided to stay on Earth to be with her.</p><p>Upon going to the city of Thebes, Hercules is reunited with his foster parents and Zeus creates a constellation of him, symbolizing Phil's dream of creating a true hero.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Emperor of China seeks an alliance with the Qui Gong    kingdom, one that would help his Empire against prospective invaders. To do so, three of his daughters are supposed to be married to his new allies. Princesses Mei, Ting-Ting, and Su    are to be escorted towards the borders. However, the young girls are seeking a way to choose their own husbands and avoid this duty.  <br/> <br/>During the journey, Mushu tries to manipulate Mulan and Shang to break up. For if Mulan leaves the Fa family and joins the Li one, his role as guardian would be over. When Shang is thought killed, Mulan offers to replace the princesses as a bride. A rather broken-heartened one. The situation is resolved with Shang turning up alive, the alliance concluded with no marriage involved and the Fa-Li family lines legally merging.  <br/> <br/>While the film tries to depict the superiority of marriages based on love to arranged marriages, the story has unfortunate implications. The Princesses wish to find true love and abandon responsibility would endanger the safety of their Empire and their people. Mulan as the rather docile bride-to-be in an arranged marriage, waiting for Shang to resurface in order to look alive again, is a bit too reminiscent of  the stereotypical damsel-in-distress waiting for her hero. </p>",

Joker taunts and torments Batman about the death of Jason Todd, and denies any involvement. At <a href=\"/black-mask/4005-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3724\">Black Mask</a>'s headquarters, Sionis is in a fit because his \"Amazo\" was destroyed. Black promptly puts a hit on Red Hood to his men. A new recruit starts to talk about the next shipment coming in and both Batman and Red Hood have bugged the place, listening in on the conversation. It cuts to a scene with a helicopter, and Red Hood shows up and hijacks the helicopter, only to be stopped by Batman and Nightwing. Red Hood runs and Batman chases him, leaving Nightwing to clean up the mess the duo left behind. Once Nightwing is finished he joins up with Batman and the chase leads to a blimp and rooftops. The is extended leading Nightwing to saying how good Red Hood is by being able to evade Batman at every turn. The chase leads to a train station above ground and a explosion goes off leaving Batman and Nightwing temporarily unstable and lets Red Hood escape.  After reviewing the audio footage from the battle, Bruce realizes that Red Hood knows his secret identity. Dick returns home after having his injured arm bandaged by Alfred.</p><p>Bruce keeps watching the footage, making him wonder if Jason is behind the helmet. This leads to a flashback of when the duo were at their best and worst fighting The <a href=\"/riddler/4005-3718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\">Riddler</a> and some average thugs. The scene cuts to a shoot out on one of Red Hoods protected areas by Black Masks henchmen with a intrigued Red Hood watching form afar. It then cuts to another scene where one out of eight of the crime bosses that is following The Red Hood is being beaten and about to be burned when... The Red Hood jumps in to save the day, but little did Red Hood know that it was a trap and a group called, \"The Fearsome Hand of Four\" attacks Hood. Hood soon gets beaten but goes on to say he's stalling and Batman shows up and the duo are reunited and start to fight the four, when one of the four gets the upper hand on Hood, he zaps him in the head and kills him with no regard life which causes Batman to look down on Hood and they have an argument in which Hood then leaves.</p><p>Back at the Headquarters of Black Mask, Mask is given news that his shipment has once again been taken away by Hood and gets into a rage when a small red dot his seen on his neck and then to his forehead, form afar a Red Hood waves and shoots a rocket into Masks room but a reluctant Mask survives and is forced to call... for a helping hand.... Joker is set free by Mask and was given the task of killing The Red Hood. Back at Wayne manor Bruce digs up Jason;s grave site and finds that the body is still there but not a real one, Bruce gets enraged that he was fooled and bursts out of his estate to the source of where this all started. At <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/4005-40816/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\">Ra's al Ghul</a> s' mansion Batman bursts into the window from where Ra's is standing and questions him about Jason in which where Ra's confesses and tells him all he needs to know. On his way back to Gotham Batman finds that Joker has abducted all eight of Red Hoods crime bosses including Black Mask and his assistant on the bridge, Joker starts to pour gas on the hostages in a large truck container and as Joker is trying to light the event The Red Hood appears and the two have a conversation in which Joker ends by finally being able to start his lighter and starts to burn the hostages alive... then out of nowhere Batman swoops in and splashes what seems to be foam or something like it to stop the fire and tries to take Joker out with him but a sharp Hood grabs on to Joker and cuts the wire holding Joker and Hood and Joker fall into the river.</p><p>Hood tells Batman to come to <a href=\"/crime-alley/4020-55715/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55715\">Crime Alley</a> if he wanted Joker back. Showing up at a what seems to be a abandoned apartment Hood tosses Joker on the ground and starts to beat him with a crowbar,for payback after what Joker did to him five years ago. By the time Batman arrives Hood is done and waiting for Batman to arrive, When Batman shows up Hood and Batman fight it out and end up on a rooftop of a church and that's where Hood takes off his helmet and shows that in fact, he truly is Jason Todd. After another short fight Jason jumps through a window and back in the room Joker was being held in. Here the three finally are able to talk. Jason confronts Bruce as to why he never avenged him and tosses Bruce a gun and tells him to either shoot Joker or him(Jason), or else he (Jason) will kill the Joker by blowing \"his deranged brains out,\" in which Bruce refuses and turns his back, tossing the pistol aside. Jason then shoots at Batman and misses with Batman throwing a small <a href=\"/batarang/4055-46297/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46297\">Batarang</a> in the barrel of the gun Jason is holding right before he shoots again, making the pistol malfunction and explode, injuring his hand. However, Jason has an ace up his sleeve and sets off a bomb he planted in the room (similar to the one that Joker used to kill him). The bomb goes off and Jason is nowhere to be found, while Joker is found in the rubble laughing, and is returned to Arkham with Black Mask being set free with a million dollar bail and Batman going back out there, but only after telling Alfred that nothing has changed between Jason and him and sets off in his <a href=\"/batmobile/4055-41463/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\">Batmobile</a> . At the end, a quick flashback is left showing Jason's first day and first time in his Robin costume.</p>",

    "description": "<h3>*Spoilers*</h3>The film follows a mercenary named Royce (Adrien Brody) who is abducted by alien creatures known as the Predators. He is released onto an alien planet which acts as a game reserve along with seven other humans, who, with the exception of a disgraced physician named Edwin (Topher Grace), are cold blooded killers; mercenaries, gangsters, and convicts alike. Royce reluctantly leads the group of elite warriors as they come to  realize they have been brought together to this unknown planet to be nothing more than prey for a new breed of the deadliest hunters alive. In an attempt to survive the creatures and escape the planet, they come across a mysterious human known as Noland (Laurence Fishburne) who was brought to the planet years ago  as game, but has managed to survive by scavenging anything from anyone (or anything) he can while basing himself in an abandoned Predator machine. Noland agrees to take the group back to his base, where he reveals that the Predators have been capturing and hunting humans (among other things) for sport for years. Each \"season\" the alien beings retrieve a new batch of game for three predators to hunt for sport, and Noland has been there for 10 seasons. After sharing his knowledge Noland tells the group he is going to sleep and leaves them to do whatever. After a short while the room suddenly fills with smoke and the group realizes that their scavenger friend (Noland) only brought them to his safe haven so he could take what they had. Royce devises a plan to attract the Predators so they can attempt to escape the machine and get to the predator ship to escape the planet. Eventually the group has been whittled down to three survivors (Royce, Edwin, and Isabelle) Edwin becomes injured and Royce decides to leave him behind while Isabelle refuses and stays back for him. Eventually the Super Predator catches the two and takes them back to its camp to discover that Royce has freed the Predator (the good o'le one from the first movie) in an attempt to fly the ship and escape. While the two predators fight Royce runs to the ship leaving both Edwin and Isabelle behind in the hole which the Super Predator dropped them in. After a short skirmish the Super Predator prevails and runs to destroy the ship. At this point Edwin reveals his true colors by using his scaple (which he got poison on early in the movie) to cut Isabelle and paralyze her claiming he loved this planet and he wanted to stay. Suddenly Royce appears and pulls the two up from hole and carries Isabelle to a safe spot before reversing Edwin's attempt to stab him and then booby traps Edwin to trap the Predator. When the Super Predator returns and trips the trap Royce and the Predator duke it out in a one on one fight to the finish.",

The <b><i>Green Lantern</i></b> series has grown in the comic book world over the last few years, taking over the wheel when it comes to big events in the DC Universe, so it is no surprise that it would make it's way on to the big screen sooner or later.</p><h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>The Warner Bros. film <b><i>Green Lantern</i></b> was directed by <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/martin-campbell/14-79388/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin Campbell</a>, and written by <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/greg-berlanti/14-46325/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greg Berlanti</a>, <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/michael-goldenberg/14-666717/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Goldenberg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/michael-green/14-201557/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Green</a> and <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/marc-guggenheim/14-539774/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marc Guggenheim</a>, who based the story mainly on DC's <a href=\"/green-lantern-secret-origin-secret-origin/4000-209458/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-209458\">\"Secret Origin\"</a> comic book story arc that retells the origin of Earth's first <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps</a> member <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a> for the New Earth continuity and served as one of many preludes to the very successful Blackest Night story line.</p><p><a href=\"/secret-origin/4045-55677/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55677\">Secret Origin</a> was written by <a href=\"/geoff-johns/4040-40439/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40439\">Geoff Johns</a>, now Chief Creative Officer for DC Entertainment. He had much to do with the development of the film, so it came as no surprise that he was constantly on the set of the GL movie, lending his Lantern knowledge to the filmmakers.</p><h2><b>Plot Summary</b></h2><p>In a universe as vast as it is mysterious, a small but powerful force has existed for centuries. Protectors of peace and justice, they are called the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps</a>. A brotherhood of warriors sworn to keep intergalactic order, each <a href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\">Green Lantern</a> wears a ring that grants him or her their powers. But when a new enemy called <a href=\"/parallax/4005-41293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\">Parallax</a> threatens to destroy the balance of power in the Universe, their fate and the fate of Earth lie in the hands of their newest recruit, the first human ever selected: Hal Jordan.</p><p>Hal is a gifted and cocky test pilot, but the Green Lanterns have little respect for humans, a young race that has never harnessed the infinite powers of the ring before. But Hal is clearly the missing piece to the puzzle and, along with his determination and willpower, he has one thing no member of the Corps has ever had: humanity. If <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal</a> can quickly master his new powers and find the courage to overcome his fears, he may prove not only to be the key to defeating Parallax…he will become the greatest Green Lantern of all.</p><h2>Production</h2><h3>Pre-Production/ Development</h3><p>In early 1997 was the first time Warner Bros. showed real interest in making a Green Lantern movie when they approached filmmaker and comic-book writer <a href=\"/kevin-smith/4040-42844/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42844\">Kevin Smith</a>. Smith turned down the offer and by 2006 they had changed the direction of the film to be a comedy, with scripted written by <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/robert-smigel/14-455454/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Smigel</a> that had <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/jack-black/14-52052/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Black</a> in the lead role. Shortly after the project changed direction again when <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/zack-snyder/14-387760/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zack Snyder</a> was approached to direct but eventually turned down.</p><p>At one point it was reported that <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/corey-reynolds/14-300236/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Corey Reynolds</a> Being a huge fan of <a href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\">John Stewart</a>, pitched the idea for a trilogy in he would star as <a href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\">John Stewart</a> and would not even feature Hal Jordan in the first film. He intent was to feat <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/hal-jordan/15-1233/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hal Jordan</a>, the Green Lantern Corps and even The <a href=\"/justice-league/4060-55928/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55928\">Justice League</a> in the second and third films of the trilogy.</p><p>October 2007 <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/greg-berlanti/14-46325/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greg Berlanti</a> was signed to direct and co-write along side writers <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/michael-green/14-201557/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Green</a> and <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/marc-guggenheim/14-539774/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marc Guggenheim</a> and by December 2008 <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/the-green-lantern/16-193745/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Green Lantern</a> was on its way to pre-production. In February 2009 negotiations began for the now director of the movie <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/martin-campbell/14-79388/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin Campbell</a> and the hunt for Hal Jordan began. and in July 2009 After rumors of <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/bradley-cooper/14-105422/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bradley Cooper</a> and other actors being considered for the roll, it was announced that <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/ryan-reynolds/14-4709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ryan Reynolds</a> had been cast as <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a>.</p><p>In preparation for the film, Reynolds trained for six months prior to filming, even doing gymnastics in order to get used to being rotated in the air while filming. Which actually came in pretty handy when on the first week of filming, Reynolds was being suspended 150 feet in the air.</p><h3>Filming</h3><p>Green Lantern was initially scheduled to begin filming in November 2009 at Fox Studios Australia. But was pushed back and moved to Louisiana, where test footage started being filmed. And on March 15, 2010 in <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/new-orleans/28-362/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Orleans</a>, DC's <b><i>Green Lantern</i></b> movie began its six months filming which ended on August 6, 2010.</p><p>After hearing that <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a>'s suit would be created using <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/cgi/27-536/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGI</a>, and that the signature white gloves would not be making an appearance, fans began to ask why. And after the Entertainment Weekly cover came out, people were very mixed in their reactions to the costume.​</p><p><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/ryan-reynolds/14-4709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reynolds</a> responded at <a href=\"/wondercon/4015-55865/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55865\"><b>WonderCon,</b></a> saying that <b><i>\"I always knew it was going to be CGI from the first time I met the entire gang.\"</i></b> And that they decided to go with the motion captured suit instead of a physical suit, because <b><i>“In the mythology for the film, the suit is made of energy, and that's impossible to actually put on physically, every day, without experiencing third degrees burns\"</i></b>. He also went on to say that the suit was more of a <b><i>\"construct or manifestation of</i> <i>Hal'</i>s will and imagination.\"</b></p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><h3><a href=\"/wondercon/4015-55865/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55865\">WonderCon</a> 2011</h3><p>Warner Bros. revealed nine minutes of footage from the first ever live-action depiction of the popular <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC</a> character, which really switched expectations of the fans in a positive way, after being worried that the film was going to be more of a comedy, ever since <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/the-green-lantern-theatrical-trailer/128-429/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>the first trailer</b></a>.</p><p>The feedback so so positive that shortly after Warner Bros. Released a <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/green-lantern-trailer-2/128-587/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>four minutes version of the footage</b></a> on the internet, that really showed off the hardcore Cosmic stuff that fans were hoping for. And that more comedic parts of the film were nowhere to be found. Which <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/ryan-reynolds/14-4709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reynolds</a> addressed when he talk about the balance of comedy with the more serious elements of the film and said that; <b><i>“In terms of the overall film, I would say that Hal is far more aggressive in the movie than he is funny. Once we get into the middle of that second act, everything is pretty serious.\"</i></b> Which fans were happy to hear.</p><h2>Behind The Scenes...</h2><p>Green Lantern was filmed in New Orleans. The representatives of the Green Lantern film claimed New Orleans was the perfect place to shoot a big budget comic book film. They said with Louisiana's great tax incentives, a large local crew base and even the Lakefront Airport are only a little of many reasons why they filmed in New Orleans.</p><p>Chris Pine and Anton Yelchin were also offered the role of Green Lantern, but ultimately, it was given to Ryan Reynolds.</p><p>During filming, Ryan Reynolds separated his shoulders, which caused lots of pain and the filming was put on a temporary shots. Re-takes are currently being done.</p>",

A brave, yet mild-mannered young soldier, <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Steve Rogers</a>, deemed unfit for service for physical reasons, volunteers to undergo a series of experiments for the U.S. Military Super-Soldier program, in which Dr. <a href=\"/abraham-erskine/4005-43681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43681\">Abraham Erskine</a> develops the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\">Super Soldier Serum</a>. Dr. Erskine is later assassinated by <a href=\"/heinz-kruger/4005-68691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68691\">Heinz Kruger</a>, the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a>'s top assassin.</p><p>The military succeeds in transforming Rogers into a living weapon, but quickly decide that the Super-Soldier is too expensive to risk losing in combat. So, the United States Military decides to use him as an army celebrity and parade him around Europe to boost morale by having him perform at USO shows for Allied troops. Then, when a Nazi plot reveals itself, Rogers must rise up and become the First Avenger in order to save his country.</p><h2>Behind The Scenes</h2><p>Directer Joe Johnston has said that, while Steve Rogers wants to serve his country he is not a jingoistic American, he's just a good person, wanting to do the right thing.</p><p>The movie was originally planned to be half in World War II era, and the other half in modern day, but the script was later rewritten.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1557842\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80297/1557842-captain_america_002.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.666\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80297/1557842-captain_america_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1557842\"><img alt=\"Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80297/1557842-captain_america_002.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80297/1557842-captain_america_002.jpg 1000w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/80297/1557842-captain_america_002.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80297/1557842-captain_america_002.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter</figcaption></figure><p>The Howling Commandos appeared in the movie, although not the original Howling Commandos from the comics.

She is told that she is the only one who can slay the Jabberwocky, a dragon-like creature controlled by the Red Queen who terrorizes Underland's inhabitants. Burton said the original <i>Wonderland</i> story was always about a girl wandering around from one weird character to another and he never felt a connection emotionally, so he wanted to make it feel more like a story than a series of events. He does not see this as a sequel to previous films, nor as a re-imagining.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot</h2><p>The film begins with <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\"> Nick Fury</a>, the director of the espionage team <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\"> S.H.I.E.L.D</a> visiting a research facility. While there, he comes across the Tesseract, an unknown energy within has become active and opened a portal through space. <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\"> Loki</a>, whom has been exiled, steps through the portal and attacks the people in the base. He manages to steal the Tesseract and mind control several members of S.H.I.E.L.D which included agent Clint Barton ( <a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\"> Hawkeye</a>) and the physicist consultant Dr. Erik Selvig who help aid in his escape.</p><p>Due to this attack, Nick Fury activates the Avengers Initiative, against the wishes of the Boards members, which enables him to recruit members to help aid him. <a href=\"/agent-coulson/4005-70860/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70860\"> Phil Coulson</a> calls upon agent Natasha Romanoff ( <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\"> Black Widow</a>) to recruit <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\"> Dr. Bruce Banner</a> in <a href=\"/india/4020-55919/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55919\"> India</a> while he sends Philip Coulson to request that Tony Stark ( <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\"> Iron Man</a>) help review Selvig’s research. Nick Fury decides to approach Steve Rogers ( <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\"> Captain America</a>) himself to give him the assignment of retrieving the Tesseract from Loki and ensuring that it is back in safe hands, even though he accepts he also states that the Tessract should have been left at the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>Meanwhile, Loki meets the Other again, an alien creature he met during his exile from Asgard. The Other offers Loki an exchange for the Tesseract; an army of <a href=\"/chitauri/4060-57559/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57559\"> Chitauri</a> aliens that would help him take over <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\"> Earth</a>. Steve and Natasha make their way to <a href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\"> Germany</a> to capture Loki, who is trying to recover iridium which is needed to stabilize the Tesseract’s power and make everyone obey him, after what seems to be an impossible fight for Captain America, Iron Man comes along to fight Loki. After battling both Iron Man and Captain America, Loki surrenders and is taken back to a S.H.I.E.L.D plane to be apprehended.</p><p>As the three and S.H.I.E.L.D are escorting Loki, <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\"> Thor</a> the God of Thunder and Loki’s brother, attempts to free him so he can reason with him and take him back to Asgard, as well as the Tesseract. However, Iron Man and Thor engage in a battle that is stopped by Captain America, who persuades Thor to give up and reason with them. Loki is eventually returned to the Hellicarrier, a flying S.H.I.E.L.D air craft. Loki is placed in a cell, which was designed to hold <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\"> The Hulk</a>, so he can be questioned later about his plans.</p><p>The Avengers team come to blows with each other over how to approach Loki and what to do with the Tesseract and the recent revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D planned to use the Tesseract’s power to develop nuclear weapons. Fury explains that the events in <a href=\"/new-mexico/4020-55784/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55784\"> New Mexico</a> a year prior made S.H.I.E.L.D aware of alien life and some of which may see Earth as a target. The decision was to produce weapons with the Tesseract's energy in hopes of defending Earth should the need arise.</p><p>As the group continue to squabble amongst each other, Hawkeye leads a team of possessed agents to attack the Helicarrier. They manage to disable its engines while in the air and the Hellicarrier beings to fall. However, Iron Man and Captain America attempt to restart the engines, while Banner transforms into the Hulk despite Black Widow’s attempt to calm him down and runs amok inside the ship, leading into a battle with Thor.</p><p>Black Widow comes into conflict with Hawkeye and discovers that a blow to the head, powerful to knock him out, is strong enough to break Loki’s control. During all of the commotion, Loki manages to break free and kill Agent Coulson as well as ejecting Thor off the ship. Fury uses the death of Agent Coulson to motivate the Avengers in to working as a team. Iron Man and Captain America come to the conclusion that they must defeat Loki publically as to validate himself as ruler of Earth.</p><p>Using a device built by Selvig, powered by the Stark Tower, Loki manages to open a portal to over Manhattan, which summons a Chitauri invasion in to New York. The Avengers come to defend New York, but realize that they are becoming overwhelmed as continuous swarms of Chitauri attack Earth. The team formulate a plan to rescue civilians while Bruce Banner returns in time, and transforms into the Hulk again to attack the Chitauri invasion. Eventually the Hulk manages to confront Loki and beats him into submission.</p><p>Black Widow manages to make her way to the portal device where she finds Selvig, free of Loki’s control. He explains that Loki’s staff can be used to close the portal. Meanwhile, S.H.I.E.L.D Board members decide to attempt an end to the invasion by lauching a nuclear missile at Manhattan, despite Fury being against this action. Iron Man detects the missile and instead of destroying it in mid air he guides it in through the portal to the Chitauri fleet where it detonates. Iron Man plummets back to Earth but the Hulk catches him. Later on Nick Fury agrees to the terms laid out by Thor, to take Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard, The Avengers watch Thor escort Loki with the Tesseract back to Asgard. After all the chaos is resolved, Fury explains that the Avengers will go their separate ways until a new threat on Earth occurs again.</p><p>During the post credit scene The Other tells his master of the outcome in which the master turns around grinning and revealing himself as Thanos.</p>",

    "deck": "Based on Andy Diggle and Jock's thirty-two issue series for Vertigo which was also entitled The Losers. A team of soldiers who were betrayed by \"Codename Max\" and sentenced to their death. They survive but are pronounced dead and with nothing left to lose seek their revenge.",
    "description": "<p>The film opens with with six US special operatives--Clay, Jensen, Roque, Pooch, and Cougar--in the Bolivian jungle on a mission to assassinate an alleged druglord. </p><p>The company are very good at their job and are good friends with each other. </p><p>However they disobey orders when their boss--a mysterious man they only know by voice--orders the bombing of a building containing children. </p><p> </p><p>They rescue the children while killing the alleged druglord's gang--the team's leader Clay personally dispatches the man. </p><p> </p><p>They save the kids in a bus just as Max's planes bomb the building, and receive the children's deepest gratitude. </p><p> </p><p>When a helicopter arrives to pull them out, they elect for the children to go and them to wait for another one. </p><p> </p><p>Max shoots the helicopter with a missile and believes he has killed them--then manipulates the news to have it seem as if they killed the children. </p><p>The six men band together and vow to fight to get their lives back--and get revenge on Max. </p><p> </p><p>Months later the team--loosely dubbed The Loosers--isn't doing so well. Pooch misses his wife--who is pregnant with his kid. Jensen is desperate to see his beloved niece. Cougar doesn't talk very much, but he doesn't seem to happy. Roque keeps trying to get Clay to help them settle in, but he is intent on bringing Max and his organization--which includes much of the CIA--down. </p><p> </p><p>Everything changes when Clay meets Aisha. What starts out as a one-night stand with a particularly attractive young lady becomes a violent fistfight as Clay realizes Aisha is there for a reason other than sex. After they stop punching each other long enough for her to convince him she isn't working for Max, they agree to meet with the rest of the team in a cemetery the next day because she can help them bring down Max. She says she also wants to get kill Max and that is her motive. </p><p> </p><p>The team meets Aisha and all of them (especially Jenson) are quite attracted to her--with the exception of Roque, who doesn't trust her at all. </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, it is revealed that Max has extorted an Indian company into allowing him to purchase a bomb with extreme destructive capabilties--with an easily programmed blast radius and no environmental side effects like radiation. </p><p> </p><p>Aisha smuggles The Loosers back into the United States. The night before they start their war on Max, Aisha walks into Clay's room and the two flirt, quickly their conversation ends and they begin to have sex.</p><p>The seven plan to hijack an armored truck driving through Miami which they believe Max will be inside.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Official Synopsis</h2><p><em>Jonah Hex (Brolin) is a scarred drifter and bounty hunter of last resort, a stoic, battle-hardened gunslinger who can track down anyone… and anything. Having survived death, Jonah’s violent history is steeped in myth and legen, and has left him with one foot in the natural world and one on the “other side.” A man fated to wander alone, his sole human connection is with Lilah (Fox), whose life in a brothel has left her with scars of her own. Jonah’s past is about to catch up with him when the U.S. military makes him an offer he can’t refuse: in exchange for freedom from the warrants on his head, he must track down and stop the sinister terrorist Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich), the man who killed Hex’s family and mutilated his face with a branding iron. Turnball, who is gathering an army and preparing to unleash Hell, is also Jonah’s oldest enemy and will stop at nothing until Jonah is dead. Based on the legendary character from the comic book series from DC Comics, “Jonah Hex” is an epic action adventure about one man’s personal quest for redemption against the canvas of the battle between good and evil.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><em>\"Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment present the epic adventure, “Thor,” which spans the Marvel Universe from present day Earth to the realm of Asgard. At the center of the story is the mighty Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a powerful but arrogant warrior whose reckless actions reignite an ancient war. Thor is cast down to Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and is forced to live among humans. A beautiful, young scientist, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), has a profound effect on Thor, as she ultimately becomes his first love. It’s while here on Earth that Thor learns what it takes to be a true hero when the most dangerous villain of his world sends the darkest forces of Asgard to invade Earth.\"</em></p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p>Long ago, the <a href=\"/frost-giants/4060-57102/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57102\">Frost Giants</a> attempted to conquer the Nine Realms. <a href=\"/odin/4005-39808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-39808\">Odin</a> and his <a href=\"/asgardian-gods/4060-41205/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\">Asgardians</a> fought back against them, eventually defeating them. As a show of their victory, the Asgardians take the source of Frost Giant’s powers, the Casket of Ancient Winters.</p><p>Many years later, a grown <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> is about to inherit the throne from his father. After swearing his oath, Odin is about to make it official when Frost Giants attempt to steal back the Casket. Odin summons the <a href=\"/destroyer/4005-7940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7940\">Destroyer</a>, who kills the intruders.</p><p>After securing the Casket, Thor demands that they attack Jotunheim, the home of the Frost Giants, in retaliation. Odin denies his request, not willing to start a war when the thieves have already been punished. This angers Thor, thinking his father weak.</p><p>Later, <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> tells Thor that he agrees that they should attack the Frost Giants. Emboldened by his brother’s agreement, Thor convinces the <a href=\"/warriors-three/4060-33600/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-33600\">Warriors Three</a> and <a href=\"/sif/4005-7200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7200\">Sif</a> to come with him to Jotunheim. When they arrive, <a href=\"/laufey/4005-31821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31821\">Laufey</a>, the king of the Frost Giants, says he had nothing to do with the attempted theft and that <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a> was filled with traitors. After being provoked, Thor attacked the Giants, but eventually he and his friends found themselves overrun and retreat.</p><p>Odin saves them at the expense of the truce between the two worlds. As punishment for Thor’s arrogance, Odin strips Thor of his godly powers, exiles him to Midgard and enchants his hammer, <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a>, so that only a worthy man could lift it and receive the power of Thor.</p><p>Thor arrives on Earth and is discovered by the scientist <a href=\"/jane-foster/4005-12337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12337\">Jane Foster</a> and her team consisting of her mentor, Erik Selvig, and assistant, Darcy Lewis. Initially, they think Thor is a crazed homeless person, if a very attractive one, and take him to a hospital. The next day, some locals discover Mjolnir and unsuccessfully attempt to lift it.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> quarantines the area and confiscates of Jane’s research. As a last resort, she finds Thor, hoping he might have some answers. He tells her that if she helps him get to his hammer, he would tell her everything. She agrees and gets him to the quarantine zone. Thor breaks in and fights his way towards the hammer, we even get a glimpse of <a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Clint Barton</a>. Unfortunately, when he does get to the hammer, he is unable to lift it. With some help from Erik and a budding romance with Jane, Thor resigns himself to exile on Earth.</p><p>Back in Asgard, Loki discovers that he is not the son of Odin; he is actually the son of Laufey who Odin adopted in hopes of joining the two worlds in peace. When Odin is confronted by Loki, the stress is too much, causing him to fall into the <a href=\"/odinsleep/4015-55777/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55777\">Odinsleep</a> to recover, allowing Loki to become king. Loki then goes to Jotunheim to offer the Frost Giants the Casket in exchange for them killing Odin. They readily agree.</p><p>The Warriors Three and Sif suspect Loki of treachery and go to Earth to bring Thor back. When Loki learns of this, he sends the Destroyer after them to kill Thor. Knowing that nothing can stop it, Thor confronts the Destroyer, giving the others a chance to escape. The Destroyer strikes him, bringing him close to death, but the selfless act proved him worthy of the hammer and it came to him, restoring his powers which he uses to defeat the Destroyer. He and his godly friends return to Asgard after Thor kisses Jane and promises he will return.</p><p>Loki betrays and kills Laufey, planning on using Laufey’s attempt on Odin’s life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim, hoping to prove to Odin that he was worthy of him. Thor, filled with a newfound compassion, fights Loki to prevent the senseless destruction. Ultimately, Thor defeats Loki and was forced to destroy the Bi-Frost bridge to stop the destruction, separating Asgard from Earth. Odin awakens and prevents both Loki and Thor from falling into the abyss, created by the bridge’s destruction, but when Loki saw the disappointment in Odin’s eye, he allows himself to fall into the abyss, his fate unknown. Thor and Odin reconcile, with Thor admitting he is not yet ready to be king. Back on Earth, Janet and her team continue to look for any sign of the Bifrost and Thor.</p><p>After the credits, <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nicholas Fury</a> shows Selvig the Tesseract, wanting him to study it in hopes of discovering untold power. Loki, seen only in a reflection whispers to Selvig to agree, which he does.</p>",

Of course, the pact goes awry and Shrek must confront what life would be like in Far Far Away if he had never existed. That translates into Donkey being forced into cart-pulling duty, fat and lazy Puss in Boots trading his sword for a pink bow and the underhanded Rumpelstiltskin ruling the kingdom.”</em></p>",
