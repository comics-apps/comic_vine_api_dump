When the series was extended from two movies to three, the title no longer fit the tone of the final installment and it was changed to <em>The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies</em>.</p><h2>Official Synopsis</h2><p><em>\"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armiesâ brings to an epic conclusion the adventures of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield and the Company of Dwarves. Having reclaimed their homeland from the Dragon Smaug, the Company has unwittingly unleashed a deadly force into the world. Enraged, Smaug rains his fiery wrath down upon the defenseless men, women and children of Lake-town.</em><em>Obsessed above all else with his reclaimed treasure, Thorin sacrifices friendship and honor to hoard it as Bilboâs frantic attempts to make him see reason drive the Hobbit towards a desperate and dangerous choice. But there are even greater dangers ahead. Unseen by any but the Wizard Gandalf, the great enemy Sauron has sent forth legions of Orcs in a stealth attack upon the Lonely Mountain. </em><em>As darkness converges on their escalating conflict, the races of Dwarves, Elves and Men must decide â unite or be destroyed. Bilbo finds himself fighting for his life and the lives of his friends in the epic Battle of the Five Armies, as the future of Middle-earth hangs in the balance.\"</em></p>",

    "description": "<h2>The Plot</h2><p>While battling Dr. Animo Ben accidentally causes the self-destruct protocol on the Omnitrix. This alerts Tetrax who travels to Earth and takes Ben with him to find the creator to help stop the countdown. Despite wanting to go Gwen and Grandpa Max are not allowed to come so out their enemies wonât recognize them. Nevertheless Gwen sneaks on Board.</p><p>With the Equipment on board Tetrax uses the equipment on board of the ship to find the Omnitrixâs creator the Legendary Azmuth and go to Incarcecon the Prison Planet to find him.</p><p>After Freeing Myaxx a member of Vilgaxâs species they discover that she isnât Azmuth but rather his assistant who erased his genetic signature in revenge for not giving her some credit in the Omnitrixâs creation.</p><p>While Myaxx is unable to stop the self-destruct she does tell him that she knows how to find Azmuth and leads him to where he is hidingâ¦Xenon.</p><p>While on the Journey there, Ben finds out that the self-destruct will destroy most of the Universe including Earth and that the more he transforms the more he speeds up the clock.</p><p>Vilgax has picked up the self-destruct signal as well and follows them. Along the way he picks up Sixsix who escaped Incarcecon.</p><p>While the team goes to Azmuth they are attacked by Vilgax.</p><p>Ben successfully repels the attack though Gluto is killed and the ship is really damaged and crash lands on Azmuthâs homeworld. While tracing him they are attacked by the Florauna and Gwen is killed in the attack which depresses Ben who blames himself.</p><p>As they travel down towards Azmuthâs lair, Tetrax tells Ben his origins and how his greed had cost him his planet and his people.</p><p>They find Azmuth who refuses to help. They soon find out that he is a Galvan who doesnât care if the Whole Universe is destroyed or not. He then says the Omnitrix was designed for peace and understanding and all the people who used it used it as a weapon and are the problem.</p><p>Vilgax having recovered from the battle earlier attacks Azmuthâs home. Gwen and Gluto reappear revealing that Gluto could regenerate from even the smallest blobs left and that he was on her and rescued her from the Florauna.</p><p>Benâs actions make Azmuth change his mind who repairs the Omnitrix and gives Ben access to Way Big a gigantic alien the size of a Skyscraper.</p><p>After defeating Vilgax(by throwing him into Space), Ben offers to return the Omnitix to Azmuth who allows him to keep it. Azmuth then says he is the best person for it and that he doesnât want the trouble it brings.</p><p>After being returned home by Tetrax(who gives him a replacement hoverboard) Ben goes with his family to fight the âzombiesâ attacking the mall.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The film opens with short-order cook Frank Darbo (Rainn Wilson) telling the audience of the only two good memories he's had in a life of disappointment: marrying his beautiful wife Sarah (Liv Tyler), and an incident in which he directed a police officer to catch a purse snatcher. Frank immortalizes these two events in a pair of crayon drawings he hangs on his wall for inspiration.</p><p>Later on, Sarah, a recovering addict, leaves Frank for Jacques (Kevin Bacon), a charismatic strip club owner who gets her hooked on drugs. Frank sinks into depression, where he has a vision in which he is touched by the hand of God and meets the Holy Avenger (Nathan Fillion), a superhero from a public-access television show on the All-Jesus Network who tells Frank that God has chosen him for a very special purpose. Frank believes that God has chosen him to become a superhero and goes to a local comic book shop for inspiration. His claim that he is designing a new superhero is met with enthusiastic appreciation from the foul-mouthed store clerk, Libby (Ellen Page). Frank creates a superhero costume and assumes the identity of \"The Crimson Bolt\". Armed primarily with a pipe wrench, he begins to fight crime by delivering savage beatings to various rule breakers ranging from drug dealers and child molesters, to a man who cuts in line at the movies. The Crimson Bolt soon becomes a media sensation. Initially, the media views The Crimson Bolt as a violent psychopath, but he begins to gain public appreciation after the criminal backgrounds of many of his victims come to light. Frank later attempts to rescue Sarah, but Jacques's thugs recognize him under the costume and shoots Frank in the leg while he flees.</p><p>A wounded Frank goes to Libby for help, as his home is no longer safe with Jacques's thugs looking for him. Libby cajoles Frank into letting her become the Crimson Bolt's \"kid sidekick\", christening herself \"Boltie\" and designing a sexually suggestive costume. She proves to be even more unhinged than Frank, using her superhero guise to almost kill a man who may or may not have keyed her friend's car. Frank decides to let her go, but changes his mind when Libby rescues him from some of Jacques's thugs at a gas station. Libby soon becomes enamored with Frank, but her advances are turned down as Frank insists that he is still married. Deciding it is different when they are in their superhero identities, Libby jumps onto and molests Frank while the two are in costume. Moments later, Frank throws Libby onto the floor and runs to the bathroom. There, he encounters a vision of Sarah in the vomit in his toilet and decides that now is the time to rescue her from Jacques.</p><p>Armed with guns, pipe bombs, and bulletproof vests, Frank and Libby sneak into Jacques's ranch killing the first few guards they encounter. Eventually, they are both shot; Frank is struck in the chest, his bulletproof vest sparing him, but Libby is struck in the head leaving only half of her face and dies instantly. Devastated by her death, Frank goes into a rage, killing all of Jacques's thugs. Inside, he has a final showdown with Jacques. Jacques shoots Frank and wounds him. Frank gains the upper hand, though, and stabs Jacques to death after a final monologue. Frank takes Sarah home, and she stays with him for a few months before leaving him again. This time, however, she manages to finally overcome her addiction and uses her experiences to help others with similar problems. She remarries and has children. Frank realizes that he wasn't the chosen one, Sarah was, because if Frank and Libby didn't go to Jacques' ranch that night, her children wouldn't have been born. Frank's convinced that her children will change the world.</p><p>Frank, now with a pet bunny, looks on his wall of happy memories. Frank's entire wall is covered with pictures of his experiences from his time spent with Libby and pictures of Sarah's kids, who call him 'Uncle Frank', to totally new ones. Frank looks at every single picture, then he focuses on Libby's picture, and a tear runs down his cheek.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>\"Weâve always known that Spider-Manâs most important battle has been within himself: the struggle between the ordinary obligations of Peter Parker and the extraordinary responsibilities of Spider-Man. But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that a greater conflict lies ahead.</em></p><p><em>Itâs great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, thereâs no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: OsCorp.\"</em></p><p> </p><h2>Plot</h2><p>After graduating high school, Peter Parker has a laundry list of issues he has to deal with, which includes everything up to keeping the oath he made with George Stacy, dealing with his relationship with Gwen, the resurfacing of childhood friend Harry Osborn, his parents' mysterious ties to Oscorp, and the regular day-to-day of being <em>The Amazing Spider-Man!</em></p><p> </p><h2>Sequel</h2><p>On June 17, 2013 Sony announced that Amazing Spider-Man 3 was in the works, and was scheduled to be released on June 10, 2016, however the movie was later pushed back to an unspecified date in 2018. Unfortunately, in February 2015, Amazing Spider-Man 3 and its sequels, including the proposed spin-off was canceled after Sony Pictures signed a deal with Marvel Studios to bring Spider-Man into Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), with Tom Holland taking over Andrew Garfield's role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and making his debut appearance in 2016's <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> before reprising his role in <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em> scheduled to be released in July 7, 2017.</p>",

In preparation for the next attack, the highly esteemed Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and the International Military are training only the best young children to find the future Mazer. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield), a shy, but strategically brilliant boy is pulled out of his school to join the elite.</em></p><p><em>Arriving at Battle School, Ender quickly and easily masters increasingly difficult war games, distinguishing himself and winning respect amongst his peers. Ender is soon ordained by Graff as the military's next great hope, resulting in his promotion to Command School. Once there, he's trained by Mazer Rackham, himself, to lead his fellow soldiers into an epic battle that will determine the future of Earth and save the human race.\"</em></p>",

    "description": "<h2>Plot</h2><p>The boys are excited when their heroes, Canadian comedy duo Terrance and Phillip, release a new movie. But when the children of South Park begin repeating the foul language from the film, their parents unite in a campaign to rid the world of toilet humour and bad language. The campaign soon escalates beyond control, with America and Canada going to war and the proposed execution of Terrance and Phillip. The children of the town decide to launch a counterattack by forming a resistance group, hoping to save their idols before it is too late.</p><p>A biting satire poking fun at censorship, the movie raises the question of how much responsibility lies with the media and how much lies with parents, when it comes to the effects of television on children.</p><p>The movie is also the first time Kenny McCormick's entire face is revealed to the audience, and his voice heard clearly. The voice of Kenny is provided by Beavis and Butthead/King of the Hill creator Mike Judge.</p><h2>Awards</h2><h4>Academy Awards</h4><ul><li>Best Original Song - nomination for \"Blame Canada\"</li></ul><h4>MTV Movie Award</h4><ul><li>Best Musical Performance - won for \"Uncle Fucka\"</li></ul><h4>American Film Foundation</h4><ul><li>Nominated for The E Pluribus Unum Award For Best Feature Film</li></ul><h4>Nominated for 3 Annie Awards</h4><ul><li>Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Theatrical Feature</li><li>Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production for Mary Kay Bergman as \"Sheila Broflovski\"</li><li>Outstanding Individual Achievement for Writing in an Animated Feature Production</li></ul><h4>Chicago Film Critics Association</h4><ul><li>Won for Best Original Score (Marc Shaiman and David Newman)</li></ul><h4>New York Film Critics Circle Award</h4><ul><li>Won for Best Animated Feature</li></ul><h4>Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards</h4><ul><li>Nominated for Best Animated Film</li></ul><h4>Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards</h4><ul><li>Won for Best Music</li></ul><h4>Motion Picture Sound Editors</h4><ul><li>Won for Best Sound Editing - Music - Animation, Nominated for Best Sound Editing - Animated Feature</li></ul><h4>Online Film Critics Society Awards</h4><ul><li>Won for Best Original Score</li></ul><h4>Satellite Awards</h4><ul><li>Nominated for Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media and Best Original Song for \"Quiet Mountain Town\"</li></ul><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>\"When Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks heâs hit the jackpotâfame and fortune are his for the takingâthat is until he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyoneâs been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuityâand even a bit of wizardryâOscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.\"</em></p>",

    "deck": "The 14th DBZ movie and the first feature film since 1996's \"Path to Power.\"  Taking place shortly after the battle with Majin Buu, the Z fighters are pitted against Bills the God of destruction and the mysterious Whis.  It has the largest budget of any Dragonball animated film.",
    "description": "<p>The film opens with King Kai talking with Supreme Kai telepathically while Goku is training on King Kai's along with King Kai's monkey Bubbles. The Kais are talking about the God of Destruction Bills who has recently awoken. They are terrified as the last time he awoke he destroyed many planets. Goku interrupts them to ask what Bills was at fist thinking it was a kind of food but soon catching on it was a powerful enemy from the fear in King Kais voice. Goku pesters King Kai until he tells him about Bills. King Kai reveals that there are two Gods in the universe one who creates life and stars and one who destroys them. Goku reveals he wants to fight Bills to test his power to which King Kai angrily responds saying Goku cannot beat him.</p><p>The scene then cuts to Bills realm where an explosion is seen. It is revealed to have come from one of Bills' \"alarm bomb\". Bills assistant Whis attempt to wake Bills who is very sleepy but is eventually made get up by Whis threatening to sing. Bills then eats his breakfast enquiring about the events that transpired while he was asleep. He questions Whis if Freeza destroyed planet Vegeta while he was asleep and expresses shock when told that while he did he was killed by a \"Super Saiyan\". This reminds Bills of a dream he had about him fighting an enemy called the Super Saiyan God. When Whis expresses his disbelief Bills goes to the Oracle Fish who had told Bills thirty nine years ago that he would face a powerful enemy in thirty nine years.</p><p>Bills decides to go to King Kais planet to find Goku. The scene then cuts to Bulmas birthday where she expresses distaste over Goku and Vegeta training on her Birthday. While Bills is on his way King Kai tells Goku to hide. It is revealed that Bills was the one that made King Kais planet so small by destroying it when he lost at Hide and Seek. Bills then orders Goku to come out of his hiding lace and questions him about the Super Saiyan God. When Goku does not know about the Super Saiyan God Bills prepares to leave Goku asks him if he could fight him Bills accepts and the fight begins. First Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 3 then he rushes at Bills. Bills easily evades all of his attacks and responds with a devastating flick that almost knocks Goku out. Goku tries again but is defeated by a nerve strike.</p><p>Bills departs for Earth and King Kai warns who was training of Bills arrival. Vegeta recalls the name but cannot remember how he knows him. Vegeta goes to Bulmas party and encounters Bills there who reminds him of their first meeting. When Vegeta was but a child Bills arrived at the Saiyan palace and used King Vegeta as a stool while he was eating. Prince Vegeta saw the scene but backed away. Bulma invites Bills and Whis to her party where they have fun at the party.</p><p>The scene cuts to Emperor Pilaf and his henchmen breaking into the facility outside the party. They have been turned into children by Pilaf's wish to Shenron for Youth. They bring into the bingo prizes storing area but are interrupted by Trunks. Trunks calls Goten over but the trio run away after Goten appears as they mistake him for his father. While they are running away Mai runs back and gives Trunks the second prize diamond Trunks tells Goten that Mai is his Girlfriend to which Goten replies \"Amazing\". The scene cuts to to Mai, Shu and Pilaf taking a break after running. Pilaf while very annoyed that it was a fruitless venture is consoled when Mai reveals that she stole the Four-Star Dragonball. They plan to sell it back to its owners for one million zennies.</p><p>The scene then moves to Bulma who has been watching the trio from afar next to Trunks and Goten. She comments and Trunks' relationship with Mai. Trunks is asked to to bring her over and flies over to do so stunning the trio. He tells Mai that to act cool, he said that she was his girlfriend and asks her to play along swaying her with the promise of food and bingo. While talking Pilaf recognises Bulma and becomes even more scared but goes with Trunks when he leaves. It then goes briefly to Bills and Whis who are testing out all the different foods of Earth but goes to Bulma questioning Mai on her age to which Mai replies \"41\" which stuns Bulma but is seen as a joke. Ths is also brief as the scene cuts to Goku training on King Kais planet by trying to hold back Kamehameahas but failing and declaring he is not strong enough to defeat Lord Bills. The scene goes back to Bills and WHis eating with Bills getting irritated by the Super Saiyan God not appearing.</p><p>Bulma starts the Bingo competition with showing off the prizes including a castle, a plane and the Dragon Balls. Yamcha soon realises that the 4 star dragon ball is missing. Pilaf's gang try to run but are stopped by Trunks asking Mai about her phone number. The 4 star Dragon Ball falls out of Mai's pocket and Pilaf rushes to get it soon noticing he is surrounded by people. The gang take Trunks hostage and Pilaf holds a ransom on his life. This attempt is met by laughter considering Trunks is a Super Saiyan. The Great Saiyan man joins in as Gohan (who is a little drunk) goes along with what he thinks is a prank. He tells Mai to shoot at his face which Mai reluctantly does. Gohan deflects all the bullets with his finger but one of the bullets strike Videl in the leg. Dende heals her but notices that she is pregnant which she tells him to keep a secret as she wants it to be a surprise. Another bullet strikes Bills in the forehead which slightly itches causing him to decide to destroy the Earth. Vegeta decides to calm him down by dancing the Bingo dance while singing. This calms Bills down.</p><p>Bulma takes the Four-Star Dragon Ball off Mai and decides to start Bingo. However disaster strikes when Whis recommends Bills to try pudding. Buu is already eating the pudding and refuses to let Bills have any. Bills calls him an idiot and Buu declares that he will turn Bills into a snack and eat him. Vegeta notices and tries to run over but Bills unleashes his power and knocks Buu out cold. Piccolo, Tien Shinhan and Android 18 attack Bills but are quickly disposed. Gohan tags in and tries to take down Bills but goes down just as easily.</p><p>Vegeta goes up next and while he oes better than the others he still fails. Trunks and Goten fuse and try to take down Bills despite Vegeta's warning and are spanked for their troubles. As Vegeta awaits his death Bulma interferes and slaps Bills declaring he ruined her 38th birthday party. Bills slaps her back greatly angering Vegeta who attacks Bills once again greatly improving this time and is almost his equal but still loses. As Bills summons his attack, Goku appears and tries to get Bills to stop and has a Eureka moment. He summons Shenron and asks him about the Super Saiyan God. Shenron tells him that it was a God made by the Saiyans and that five pure-hearted Saiyans must send their energy into one Saiyan who would become a God. It had only been achieved once before by a Saiyan revolted by the evil Saiyans and almost defeated all the evil Saiyans but for the forms time limit. Shenron then departs having told Goku all he needed to know.</p>",
