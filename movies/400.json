    "deck": "An 1985 film based partly on the life of Alice Pleasance Liddell (1852 - 1934), the child said to have inspired Lewis Carroll to write his novels. By the 1930s, Alice is an elderly widowed woman who can hardly remember what the author was like. ",
    "description": "<p>Financial concerns have her visiting the United States for a celebration of Lewis Carroll's centenary. Long forgotten memories of her childhood, Charles Dodgson and his works come flooding back to her and she tries to make sense of them. Meanwhile she also struggles with the fear that her own death is approaching. She comes to realize Dodgson had a secret sorrow and tries to find out what it was. She finally remembers that Charles loved her and would like to marry her. His sorrow was being rejected by young Alice and the rest of the Liddell family. The film ends with what seem to be the ghosts of Dodgson and Alice reunited in the afterlife. While a hit of its time, it is considered controversial because of its implications of pedophilia. </p>",

    "deck": "An 1959 animated adaptation of the Charles Perrault tale. Princess Aurora is blessed at her christening by a trio of good fairies but cursed by Maleficent, an evil one angered at being ignored.",
    "description": "<p>Set in 14th century, a celebration occurs in a castle for the king and queen with their baby, Aurora. The three fairies come to christen it. They consist of Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Just as she is about to christen Aurora, Merryweather is interrupted by the arrival of evil fairy, Maleficent. Upon find out that she is not invited to the christening, Maleficent curses Aurora that in her 16th birthday, she will die upon pricking her finger in a spindling wheel. Enraged, the king orders the guards to get her, but Maleficent escapes. <br /> <br />Merryweather says that she can't break Maleficent's curse, but she can christen Aurora that instead of dying after pricking her finger in a spindling wheel, she will be put into deep sleep. <br /> <br />Because of that curse being put by Maleficent, the people begin burning spindling wheels. The king and queen allow the three fairies to pose as aunts of Aurora so that she can be protected. <br /> <br />Years later, at Maleficent's hideout, the Forbidden Mountain, she finds out that her minions are only searching for a baby. Enraged by their incompetence, Maleficent attacks them with lightning and sends her pet raven, Diablo, to find Aurora. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Aurora, renamed as Briar Rose, lives a normal life in a hut without knowledge of her past. As she is out, the fairies try to do normal things without magic. Eventually, Merryweather is fed up and Flora reluctantly agrees with using magic. <br /> <br />In the forest, Aurora is dancing with Prince Philip.<br /> <br />At Aurora's house, Flora and Merryweather got to fight about the color of Aurora's dress that Diablo manages to locate the fairies. When they fixed everything up and Aurora comes home telling them about that she danced a prince, the fairies knew it's about time to tell her the real truth of her past. When they told her that she is forbidden to see Philip again, Aurora goes to her room crying. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Philip tells his father of wishing to marry Aurora, not knowing that she is the princess that his father wants him to marry. <br /> <br />In Aurora's castle, Maleficent lures Aurora to touch the spindling wheel, completing the curse. Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather are saddened by this event and puts the entire castle into a deep sleep. While doing so, Flora discovers that Philip is the prince that Aurora has met earlier.<br /> <br />In the forest, Philip comes looking for Aurora, but he is captured by Maleficent so that he will not try to kiss her. By the time they got there, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather finds out that Maleficent has taken Philip to the Forbidden Mountain. <br /> <br />They sneak into the Maleficent's castle. Inside, Maleficent goes to the dungeon to meet Philip. In one of the cells, she shows him Aurora and leading him to realize that she is the peasant girl he danced earlier. After Maleficent leave, the three fairies rescue Philip and Flora gives him the Shield of Virtue and Sword of Truth in fighting Maleficent. <br /> <br />As they leave, Diablo is shocked to see the fairies and Philip escaping and calls on the guards to get them. However, he is turned to stone by Merryweather. <br /> <br />Upon seeing Philip escape, Maleficent tries to take him out with electric bolts, but to no avail. She summons dark thorns so that Philip can't get to the castle. Enraged, Maleficent teleports to Philip and transforms into a black dragon. Philip manages to kill her by throwing his sword to her chest and sending her falling to her death. <br /> <br />Philip goes to the castle and kisses Aurora, bringing her back. Afterwards, they danced. However, Flora and Merryweather go to an argument again about the color of Aurora's dress.</p>",

She intends to face her fears. But Jason has picked the farm as a resting spot while recovering from wounds received in Part II.",
    "description": "<p>The masked slasher returns yet again after barely surviving a brutal blow to the shoulder from his own machete.  <br /> <br />Jason went to a road side store and grabbed himself a new set of clothes while stalking a new couple before returning to bring death to any who enter \"his\" woods.  Chris Higgins arrived with her friends back at her old family home where only three years ago she was attacked by Jason. Right from the start Chris had a bad feeling that something or some one is watching them; Jason was now hiding in the barn tending to his wounds.   <br /> <br />A group of bikers who had a run in with the teens earlier on started to siphon gas.  Suddenly one of them disappeared inside the barn where he found a hockey mask.  Jason quickly made short work of the biker and claimed the mask as his own.  When their friend didn't return the other two bikers decided to investigate.  When they looked in the barn Jason killed them quickly.  Having stained his infamous machete with new blood and obtaining his infamous mask Jason decided to go on the hunt once again and slowly picked off the unsuspecting teens until only one was left....Chris Higgins.  </p>",

    "description": "<p>Two teens on a fishing trip ended up in Crystal Lake.  There Jason rose up and brutally slashed the young couple into pieces. Taking the boat for himself, Jason floated into a near-by harbour where a large cruise ship sat waiting for its guests to arrive; the graduating class of a near-by high-school who were due to cruise to Manhattan. Jason swam to the ship, and was hauled onboard when the captain drew the anchor.  <br /> <br />Onboard the cruise ship, Jason was angrier than ever and quickly started slaughtering all the students who he encountered.  After killing off all but a few of the graduates, the ship stopped in Manhattan. The survivors leapt from the ship and attempt to swim to Manhattan to find help.  They believed Jason was finally dead.  However, no one would believe them, so they were forced to start moving again.  They saw their fears were true; Jason was alive and still pursuing them. Jason continued to hunt the survivors, right down to his final victim.</p>",

    "deck": "An 1999 entry in the James Bond series. Bond is assigned with protecting Electra King, an oil mogul whose father was murdered by Renard, an elusive terrorist. Bond becomes Electra's lover but finds himself sharing the position with Renard. The former terrorist being Elektra's puppet.",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p> The World is Not enough is the 19th official James Bond film and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. The title is derived from a line in both the book and film versions of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the phrase is the motto of Bond's family. In The World Is Not Enough 007 must protect an oil heiress, Elektra King from a criminal called Renard.</p><p>This is Michael Apted's first and only James Bond film. The theme was performed by the band Garbage and the score was written by David Arnold.</p><h2>Plot</h2><h3>Pre-title sequence</h3><p>In the pre-title sequence Bond is at a Swiss Bank in Bilbao, Spain, on assignment from M to retrieve a large sum of money from the account of a friend of hers, Sir Robert King-an oil tycoon. While there he questions a banker about the death of his partner, 0012; the man is murdered by his assistant before he can utter a word. Bond escapes and upon his arrival in London, the briefcase explodes at MI6 headquarters, killing Sir Robert. He spots the assassin from the bank and chases after her in a boat chase down The Thames River. He chases her until they arrive at the Millennium Dome where she attempts to escape via use of a hot air balloon. He follows climbing up on the safety line, up there he offers he MI6 protection in return for her cooperation in the investigation of the deaths of Sir Robert King and 0012. She refuses and kills herself by detonating the balloon. Bond lets go of the safety, falling a short distance onto the dome.</p><h3>Main Plot</h3><p>While in Scotland attending the funeral of Sir Robert, Bond traces the money back to Renard, a former KGB agent turned terrorist. Bond is told that MI6 once attempted to assassinate Renard but failed, leaving a bullet lodged in Renard's head, the bullet is slowly making it's way through Renard's head gradually taking away his senses giving him an immunity to pain. Bond is then assigned by M to protect King's daughter Elektra; Renard once kidnapped Elektra and MI6 believe he's planning on doing it again.</p><p>He flies to Azerbaijan where Elektra is overseeing the construction of a new pipeline stretching from the Caspian Sea to Turkey. While joining Elektra on a tour of the proposed location for the pipeline, Bond and Elektra by a hit squad sent by Renard, equipped with armed para-glider equipped snowmobiles. </p><p>Fending off the hit squad Bond pays a visit to an old friend of his, Valentin Zukovsk- a casino owner for information on the attackers.While there he finds that Elektra's head of security, Davidov is in league with Zukovsky. After having sex with Elektra, Bond stows away in Davidov's car to a nearby airstrip. While there Bond kills Davidov in cold blood and sneaks aboard a Russian plane bound for a nuclear weapons facility in Kazakhstan</p><p>Posing as a nuclear physicist Bond infiltrates the facility to find out why Renard's men are at an ICBM facility. While there a scientist at the facility, Dr. Christmas Jones follows him as she's suspicious of him and suspects that he's not as he seems. Inside Bond watches Renard remove a locator card from one of the bombs, before he could kill him his cover is blown by Christmas. Renard steals the bomb and flees, leaving his men, the workers, Bond and Jones to die in the explosive laden facility. Bond retrieves the locator card and escapes along with Christmas as the whole facility explodes.</p><p>Returning to Azerbaijan Bond informs M that he thinks Elektra may not be as she seems. The two are then interrupted by an unexpected attack on the pipeline; the bomb that Renard stole in Kazakhstan was onboard an inspection rig headed towards the main terminal. Bond and Christmas go after it, entering the pipe on a separate rig. When defusing the bomb Christmas discovers that half the plutonium is missing. Realizing that the whole thing was a set up just to get Bond away from M he orders Christmas to jump off the rig and wait for the explosion.</p><p>After the explosion Bond radios in, learning M has been kidnapped. Elektra and Renard then rendezvous at Maidens Tower in Istanbul, Turkey. He presents her with the other half of the plutonium and in return she presents him with M, locked in a small cell. Renard sets an alarm clock down on top of a stool in front of her cell, promising her that she will be killed tomorrow, at noon.</p><p>During that same night Bond pays a visit to Zukovsky, at his caviar factory in the Caspian Sea, under the belief that he is working for Elektra. While interrogating him the factory becomes under attack by helicopters, confirming Bond's suspicions. Zukovsky swore that their arrangement was only for Victor III class Submarine, currently being captained by his nephew. If Renard were to take the plutonium he stole and place in the nuclear reactor of the sub, the explosion would level the entire city of Istanbul, sabotaging a Russian pipeline. Elektra's pipeline is supposed to run directly around the city, dramatically increasing the value of her oil. Renard and his men poison the crew of the submarine and then hijacks it.</p><p>M, realizing she still has the locator card snatches the alarm clock and uses the battery to power the locator card, sending off a signal with her location to Bond. As Bond leaves, Zukovsky's henchman Mr. Bullion places an explosive to kill Bond. Bond and Christmas escape however but are captured by Bullion and several other men. Bond is placed into a garrote, ancient torture device while Christmas is brought aboard the sub. While Elektra is torturing Bond, Zukovsky storms demanding to know what she's done with his nephew.</p><p>Bond makes a gesture towards the table and Zukovsky sees Nikolai's hat; as soon as he realizes he's dead Elektra shoots him. Before he dies Zukovsky fires a shot from his gun concealed in his cane, pretending to fire at Bond but really firing at one of Bond's restraints, freeing him. Bond grabs the gun from Elektra and chases after her, stopping just long enough to free M. Bond asks Elektra to call off the plan but she refuses and he shoots, killing her.</p><p>Diving after the sub, Bond boards it and briefly battles with Renard's men and amidst the confusion causes the it to dive rather than surfacing. The submarine hits the sea floor nose on, causing the hull to crack. Catching up to Renard Bond discovers him shoving the plutonium rod into the reactor core, fighting him but loses. He then hoists himself up to the pressure release to reconnect the pressure hose, causing the reactor to backfire; impaling Renard with a nuclear rod. Bond and Christmas make their escape via use of the torpedo tubes, leaving the damaged reactor to safely detonate underwater.</p><p>Later that evening, Bond and Christmas enjoy champagne with one another, celebrating the new millennium together in Istanbul. M, joined by the new Q and several other members of the secret service spot Bond by use of a thermal imaging camera.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Bond has the assistance of Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson and Miranda Frost. Only one of the two ladies is a double agent. While a box office hit, the film received mostly negative reviews. Often criticisms include an over-reliance on special effects and weak characterization. The film managed to anger both North and South Korea due to their depictions. The North is depicted as particularly brutal and war-mongering. The South is depicted as a United States protectorate, to the point of an American giving commands to the South Korean Army. </p>",
