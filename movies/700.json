    "deck": "Everyone now knows Tony Stark is Iron Man, and now Tony is being pressured by the government to share the schematics of the Iron Man armor, for military use. Paranoid of the fact that the schematics could fall into the wrong hands, Tony hides the secrets of the Iron Man.",
    "description": "<p>A few months after revealing to the public that he is Iron Man, Tony is being confronted by the government to hand over the technology of the suit to be used by what they consider a more responsible user. Tony defends his technology from the government and in the meantime running the Stark Expo, an event showing the world new advances in technology. What he is keeping secret is that the palladium in Tony's Arc Reactor is slowly killing him. He has made attempts to find an alternative element to power the Reactor, but to no avail. Tony begins to gradually set affairs in order by making Pepper CEO of the company and is replaced by Natalie Rushman, as an assistant for Stark.</p><p>While racing his car in the Circuit De Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko, who slices Tony's car in half with his energized whips. With quick thinking and the help Pepper, Happy and a portable suit, Tony defeats Vanko and he is taken in. Tony realizes that Vanko has an Arc Reactor of his own, so he confronts Vanko asking where he obtained this technology, and Vanko replies it was a design made by his father, Anton Vanko. Vanko then threatens that soon the Stark name and his world wil crumble around him. He also knows that the Arc Reactor is killing him. after talking with Tony, Vanko manages to fake his death and go into hiding, working for Tony's rival, Justin Hammer, to create a unit of Iron Men drones.</p><p>As Tony feels the end coming towards him, he begins a self destructive path. He arranges a party and he gets drunk in his Iron Man suit, firing pulse blasts at tossed objects for target practice. Jim Rhodes arrives and realizes that Tony is endangering all of the people at the party, due to his recklessness. Rhodes dons the Mark II suit and cofronts Tony, evacuating the house and get into a brawl that results in a large amount of Tony's home being wrecked. After the fight, Rhodes flies off to the military with the Mark II suit.</p><p>Tony is later found by Nick Fury and admits that he was being monitored by one of his agents, Natalie Rushman who is actually Natasha Romanoff. Fury tells Tony that his father, Howard Stark was one of the founders of S.H.I.E.L.D. and used to work with Ivan's father, who wanted to use the Arc Reactor for personal gain ( the reason that Vanko is after the Stark name is because of what happened to his father). Fury also provides Tony with some old videos of his father to point him the right direction.</p><p>After Tony tries to reconcile with Pepper about his behavior, He discovers a secret formula in a diarama of the Stark Expo, finding a new element. Tony sets up a device to harness its power and manages to use it as an alternative source of power for a new Arc Reactor. Tony is contacted by Vanko, revealing that he is still alive, and plans to attack at the Stark Expo.</p><p>When Tony arrives he realizes that Hammer and Vanko have made a garrison of Robotic drones based on his design as well as a new, upgraded Mark II suit being used by Rhodes. Vanko overrides the drones and Rhodes' suit to attack Tony, leading to a pursuit over the city. With the help of Pepper, Natasha, and Happy, they let Rhodes regain control and help Tony fight off the drones. Vanko arrives in an improved suit of his own and fights the both of them. Tony and Rhodes work together to take down Vanko and in a last ditch effort to kill Stark, Vanko activates a self-destruct system on himself and his drones. Tony flies off to save Pepper from the explosions and after the chaos they kiss and make up, and Pepper steps down as CEO so Tony can take over.</p><p>Tony and Rhodes are later awarded with medals for their achievements.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\"></div>",

    "deck": "A cowboy toy is profoundly threatened and jealous when a fancy spaceman toy supplants him as top toy in a boy's room.",
    "description": "<p>The first full length, computer animated movie. The initial concept was based on the short Tin Toy (1988) which featured a wind-up toy running from a baby. John Lasseter received a special achievement award from the academy in 1996 for the film and its contributions to computer animation.</p><h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The movie opens on a little boy, <a href=\"/andy/4005-70051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70051\">Andy</a>, playing with a cloth cowboy doll named <a href=\"/sheriff-woody/4005-37411/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37411\">Woody</a>. Despite being an older toy (complete with pull string voice box), Woody is clearly Andy's favorite toy and the hero of his adventures. However, when the humans are out of the room, the toys come to life. Woody serves as leader of the toys, helping them deal with the immediate crisis of Andy's birthday party (where he may get new toys to replace his old toys), the problem neighbor boy, Sid, who destroys toys, and an impending move. Woody deploys some green army men (lead by <a href=\"/sarge/4005-70054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70054\">Sarge</a>) with a baby monitor to monitor what Andy gets for his birthday. The party goes well, with no new toys to compete with them, but the baby monitor falls down and the sound cuts out when Andy is opening a surprise present. By the time the baby monitor is working again, Andy and his friends are returning to Andy's room so the toys must play dead. Woody is swept off the bed for the new, mystery toy which is revealed to be a spaceman action figure named <a href=\"/buzz-lightyear/4005-7848/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7848\">Buzz Lightyear</a>.</p><p>Unlike the other toys, Buzz believes he is the <i>real</i> Buzz Lightyear, an actual space explorer who can actually shoot lasers and fly. Buzz can seemingly do no wrong and continually seems to replace Woody both in terms of being Andy's new favorite toy and being a hero in the eyes of the other toys. Woody grows progressively more jealous and plans to knock Buzz behind a desk (so he can just be lost/forgotten there for a while), but the plan goes wrong and instead Buzz is knocked out the window. The other toys see that Woody \"murdered\" Buzz, but Woody is then taken with the family to the Pizza Planet restaurant. Buzz climbs in the car and confronts Woody at a gas station, causing them to both be left behind. The two have to cooperate and hitch a ride in the Pizza Planet delivery truck to try to meet Andy at the restaurant. However, Buzz drags them both into a rocket-shaped crane machine (thinking that it is a real rocket), where they are won by Sid.</p><p>At Sid's house, both Buzz and Woody are terrified as Sid gives a toy to his vicious dog, Scud, to destroy and steals his little sister's doll, cuts off its head, and replaces it with a dinosaur's. In his room, Sid has other horrible, monster toys constructed from parts of other toys like a one-eyed baby doll head attacked to a mechanical, spider body. While at Sid's house, Buzz sees a commercial for Buzz Lightyear action figures, with the ad explicitly stating that the toys do not fly. Buzz tests this, only to fall, one of his arms popping out in the process. This puts Buzz largely out of commission as he tries to reconcile with the fact that he is a toy. Woody tries to convince the rest of Andy's toys to help him back, but they see Buzz's unattached arm and think the worse. However, Woody soon discovers that Sid's toys are actually friendly and help put back together other toys (like the doll and the dinosaur) and quickly reattach Buzz's arm. Before the two can escape Sid straps Buzz to a rocket and plans to blow him up tomorrow, the same day Andy's family moves. Buzz and Woody have a heart to heart and both realize that they need to do what's best for Andy.</p><p>Woody and Sid's toys make a plan to help Buzz and Woody escape and make sure Sid never tortures toys again. After luring the dog outside, they all gather in the backyard and begin talking and walking towards Sid, scaring him away. Buzz and Woody begin running towards the departing moving van but are pursued by Scud. Buzz tackles the dog, allowing Woody to make it, but Woody gets Andy's RC car, and pushes it over the edge to go and save Buzz. The other toys view this as him trying to lose another toy and throw Woody out of the car too. Buzz and Woody ride the RC car, and manage to escape the dog. The other toys see Buzz and Woody and try to help, but the car runs out of batteries and the truck drives on. They light the rocket on Buzz's back and shoot towards the truck where they drop off the RC car, buzz detaches the rocket shortly before it explodes by spreading his wings, and they fly into the car and landing on the box next to Andy. Andy sees his missing toys had been in the car the whole time, just where he left them.</p><p>At their new house it's now Christmas and everything is peaceful, and Buzz and Woody are friends. Now the toys are hopeful for what Andy might get, though are still monitoring the situation. Woody is laughing that nothing could be worse than Buzz, and it's revealed that Andy got a puppy for Christmas.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Original Concept</h2><p>Originally this feature was supposed to be a tie in between the \"Justice League\" and \"Justice League Unlimited\" seasons called \"When Worlds Collide\". Some factors are obviously left in the script such as the acquisition of Wonder Womans Invisible Jet, and the development of the new Watchtower and it's teleporter, Also, the seventh member of the Crime Syndicates \"heads\" is Zauriel (an analogue for Hawkgirl who was the Leagues seventh member in the Justice League series). The script Dwayne Mcduffie wrote was mainly kept intact, but due to Warner Bros. animation studio becoming defunct, It was decide to be released as an original, individual feature</p><h2>Catchy dialogue</h2><p>Superwoman: \"I take it back. You are much crazier than I am.\"</p><p>Owlman: \"Don't get in my way.\"</p><p>Superwoman: \"On the contrary, &lt;smooch&gt;, I'm in.\"</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>Just like other DCUA Original Movies that came before this one, <i>Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths</i> has received very positive reaction.The World's Finest, one of the first sites to review the movie, said, \"<i>...the film ranks up there as one of Dwayne McDuffie's better works in the animated DC world and even though it’s reminiscent of stories we’ve seen in animation before, the brilliant work done by Moi, the directing by Sam Liu and Lauren Montgomery, and story make it more than worth watching again.\"</i></p>",

She needs the girl to retrieve the \"Devil's Eye\" diamond, a treasure lost in the swamps of Louisiana. This adds the theme of child labor to the film.

    "description": "<p>One day in Paris 1910, wealthy and aging former opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille announces that she wants to pass her inheritance on to her four cats, and for Madame Adelaide's butler Edgar to look after the cats until they die and then eventually inherit the money for himself.</p><p>Edgar believes that he will be dead before he has the chance to inherit the fortune, and tries to get rid of Dutchess and her kittens. He drugs the cats with sleeping pills, and then goes to the countryside to get rid of them. The cats are then left in the countryside, and so they are made to fend for themselves. While being there, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens back to their home in Paris.</p><p>On their return, the cats hitch a ride on the back of a milk cart but are then chased off by the driver. Marie subsequently falls into a river and is saved by O'Malley. O'Malley and Dutchess then fall in love, and Duchess is asked to marry Thomas. Marie likes the idea of having a father figure in her life however, Dutchess turns Thomas down out of loyalty to Madame Adelaide and her home. The cats then return to the mansion with the help of O'Malley, where Dutchess and the kittens have to say goodbye.</p><p>Upon their return however, Edgar re-captures the cats and this time decides to ship them off to Timbuktu. O'Malley returns and saves Dutchess and the kittens, with the help of other alley cats. In the end, Edgar is instead locked into the trunk, and sent to Timbuktu instead. Madame Adelaide then re-writes her will, excluding Edgar and including O'Malley. O'Malley then marries Dutchess, and now lives with her and the kittens in Madame Adelaide's mansion.</p><p> </p>",

The original tales were violent and most of the protagonists were depicted as remorseless killers. Notably Mowgli skinning the corpse of Shere Khan and leading the jungle animals in attacking and demolishing a human village. Instead the film features a kid-friendly jungle and Mowgli never ages to adulthood.  <br /> <br />The film was a critical and financial hit, considered a fitting swan song to Walt Disney who died during its production. Thye songs of the film are considered among the most notable in the Disney canon. On the other hand, several critics pointed that the film was \"devoid of mood or atmosphere\"    </p>",

The movie was only shown at his art exhibits and is a homage paid by Warhol to the character itself. The movie is considered the first appearance of a blatant \"campy\" Batman. The movie, which was at one time considered lost, turned up in 2006 when some of it's scenes were shown in the documentary <i><b>Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis</b>.</i></p>",

    "deck": "George A. Romero's 1968 horror classic tells the tale of a farmhouse full of survivors in rural Pennsylvania as they combat flesh-hungry corpses reanimated by radioactivity from Venus.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot</h2><p>Barbra \"Judith O'Dea\" and Johnny \"Russell Streiner\" head to a rural cemetery in <a href=\"/pennsylvania/4020-55741/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55741\">Pennsylvania</a> to place a wreath of flowers on their late father's grave. Johnny teases his sister, who is afraid of cemeteries, taunting, \"They're coming to get you, Barbra!\" A pale-faced <a href=\"/zombies/4015-55691/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55691\">zombie</a> \"S. William Hinzman\" suddenly grabs Barbra and Johnny rushes to save her. A fight ensues, but the young man is killed when he falls and smashes his head into a tombstone. Barbra flees into the car, but the zombie chases her. Barbra attempts to flee as the zombie attempts to break in, but she doesn't have the key. She releases the emergency brake, and the car rolls away from the zombie. Barbra soon crashes into a tree, still chased by the zombie. She abandons the car and escapes into a nearby farmhouse to hide, still chased by the zombie. She soon finds, however, that others like the man are outside. While exploring the empty house, Barbra discovers a hideously mutilated corpse at the top of the stairs.</p><p>While attempting to flee the house, she encounters Ben \"Duane Jones\", who arrives in a pick up truck and defends the house against another pack of zombies, After subduing the pack, Ben sets the bodies on fire, scaring off the remaining zombies. Inside the house, another zombie emerges from a side room and Ben fights off the zombie. This is followed by an intense argument about Barbra's desire to search for Johnny. After a brief struggle, Barbra collapses in shock, and Ben carries her to a couch. Ben boards up the doors and windows from the inside, and takes a chair outside and scares off the attackers by setting it afire. Ben finds a rifle and a radio as Barbra lies catatonic. The two are unaware that Harry \"Karl Hardman\" and Helen Cooper \" Marilyn Eastman, their daughter Karen \"Kyra Schon\" , and young couple Tom \"Keith Wayne\" and Judy \"Judith Reilly\" have been hiding in the cellar until later. One of the attackers bit Karen earlier and she has fallen ill. Harry wants the group to barricade themselves in the cellar, but Ben argues that they would, effectively, be trapping themselves. Ben carries the argument, and the group cooperates to reinforce the main part of the house.</p><p>Radio reports explain that an epidemic of mass murder is sweeping across the eastern seabord. Later, Ben discovers a television upstairs and the emergency broadcaster reveals that the creatures are consuming the flesh of their victims. A subsequent broadcast reports that the murders are being perpetrated by the recently deceased who have returned to life, dubbed 'ghouls'. Experts, scientists and military are not sure of the cause of the reanimation, but one scientist is certain that it is the result of radiation emanating from a space probe that exploded in the Earth's atmosphere . A final report instructs that a gunshot or heavy blow to the head will stop the ghouls and that armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.</p><p>Ben devises a plan to escape using his truck involving all of the men in the house. The truck is in need of fuel, so Ben and Tom go to an outside gas pump, while Harry hurls Molotov Cocktails from an upper window. On the way out the door, Judy fears for Tom's safety and chases after him. Upon arriving at the pump, Ben places a torch on the ground next to the truck, and Tom carelessly splashes gasoline onto the torch, starting a fire that quickly engulfs the truck. Tom tries to drive the truck away from the gas pumps to avoid further damage, but when he goes to exit the truck, Judy gets stuck. Tom goes back into the truck to help her, but the truck explodes, killing them both. Ben runs back to the house to find that Harry has locked him out. He kicks the door open and, in a fury, gives Harry a fierce beating.</p><p>Some of the undead horde converges upon the truck and begin eating Tom and Judy's charred remains. Meanwhile, others try to break through the doors and windows of the house. Ben manages to hold them back, but drops his rifle. Harry seizes the fallen rifle and turns it on Ben, who wrestles it away from Harry and shoots him. Harry stumbles into the cellar and dies.</p><p>Shortly after, Helen discovers that her daughter, Karen, has been transformed into one of the ghouls and is consuming her father's corpse. Karen repeatedly stabs her mother with a cement trowel, killing her, before going upstairs. Meanwhile, the undead finally break into the house and Barbra sees her brother Johnny among them. The undead take Barbra away. Ben retreats into the cellar, locking the door behind him, ironically taking the course of action that Harry had recommended in the first place. He shoots the reanimated Harry and Helen Cooper, and waits out until morning, hoping for any chance of escaping the zombies.</p><p>In the morning, a posse approaches the house, hunting the remaining ghouls. Hearing the commotion, Ben ambles up the cellar stairs into the living room. Sheriff McClelland spots him through a window, and, mistaking him for a zombie, orders one of the posse members to shoot him. Still shots are shown of the vigilantes dragging Ben's body from the house and placing it on a pyre, next to the zombie that had attacked Barbra at the start of the film, as the closing credits roll. The film ends with a brief clip of the pyre burning.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The blood is actually Bosco chocolate syrup.</li><li>The zombie hand that Tom (Keith Wayne) hacks up with a kitchen knife was made of clay and filled with chocolate syrup.</li><li>When the zombies are eating the bodies in the burnt-out truck they were actually eating roast ham covered in chocolate sauce. The filmmakers joked that it was so nausea inducing that it was almost a waste of time putting the makeup on the zombies, as they ended up looking pale and sick anyway.</li><li>The gas pump was not bolted to the ground when the actress who played Barbra, Judith O'Dea, runs into it at the start of the film. She did it with so much force she almost tipped it over on the cameraman.</li><li>One of the working titles for this film was \"Night of Anubis\". Anubis is the god of embalming/mummifying in the ancient Egyptian (Kemetan) religion.</li><li>One of the working titles for this film was \"Night of the Flesh Eaters\". Originally, the beings attacking the characters were extraterrestrial in origin, either aliens or humans possessed by an alien pathogen, presumably covering a NASA satellite returning from Venus. Eventually, it was decided that the dead would rise and devour the living, presumably due to radiation that was carried by a NASA satellite returning from Venus.</li><li>Though the radiation of a detonated satellite returning from Venus is theorized to be the cause of the dead rising and attacking the living, according to the filmmakers, the actual cause is never determined.</li><li>Columbia Pictures was the only major Hollywood studio interested in distributing this film, but eventually passed because it was in black-and-white at a time when movies had to compete with new color televisions. Ironically, Columbia did distribute the 1990 color remake. American International Pictures (AIP) considered releasing the film, but wanted George A. Romero to shoot an upbeat ending and add more of a love story subplot.</li><li>During the filming of the cemetery sequence, shot on two separate days, an unexpected accident caused a fast change of script. The car driven by Barbara and Johnny into the cemetery was actually owned by the mother of Russell Streiner. Unfortunately, sometime between the two filming sequences, someone ran into the car and put a dent in it that would easily be visible on camera. George A. Romero rewrote the scene so the car would come to a stop by crashing into a tree.</li><li>In the scene where Ben is nailing wooden boards to the door, small numbers can be seen on them. These were written on the backs of the boards so they could be removed and replaced in between shots, preserving continuity. Some numbers are visible because some of the boards were nailed on backwards.</li><li>Tom Savini was originally hired by George A. Romero to do the makeup effects for this film. The two were first introduced to each other when Savini auditioned for an acting role in an earlier film that never got off the ground. Romero, remembering that Savini was also a makeup artist (he had brought his makeup portfolio to show to Romero at the audition), called Savini to the set of his horror movie. However, Savini was unable to do the effects because he was called to duty by the US Army to serve as a combat photographer in Vietnam.</li><li>The film's first scene, the initial cemetery attack on Barbara and Johnny, was the last filmed, in November 1967. The actors had to hold their breath to avoid visible condensation in the frosty autumn air.</li><li>According to George A. Romero, the film was originally ten minutes longer but the distributor pressured him to cut it down.</li><li>The word \"zombie\" is never used. The most common euphemism used to describe the living dead is \"those things,\" mostly by Cooper.</li><li>Bill 'Chilly Billy' Cardille, who played the television reporter, was indeed a local Pittsburgh TV celebrity. Known as \"Chilly Billy\" Cardille, he hosted a horror movie program on Channel 11 and occasionally reported the news.</li><li>S. William Hinzman and Karl Hardman, two of the original $300 investors had small roles due to a shortage of available talent. Another investor was a butcher, who provided some blood and guts.</li><li>Actor/co-producer Karl Hardman (Harry Cooper, the father in the basement), also served as makeup artist, electronic sound effects engineer, and took the still photos used for the closing credits.</li><li>When the writers decided to base the film on zombies, they brainstormed about what would be the most shocking thing for the zombies to do to people and decided on cannibalism.</li><li>During production, the film's title was still being chosen. The working title was simply \"Monster Flick\".</li><li>The character of Ben was originally supposed to be a crude but resourceful truck driver. After 'Duane Jones (I)' auditioned for the part, director and co-writer George A. Romero re-wrote the part to fit his performance.</li><li>George A. Romero has readily admitted that Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls (1962) was a big influence in his making of this film.</li><li>The main house did not have a true basement but a dirt potter's cellar, and thus had no long staircase leading down to it. Because of this, the basement scenes were filmed in the editing studio's cellar.</li><li>In the 30th Anniversary Edition, the car that drops off Debbie Rochon at the medical center is driven by Marilyn Eastman (Helen Cooper) and owned by Karl Hardman (Harry Cooper).</li><li>The music used in the film was from a Capitol/EMI Records Hi-Q stock music library, on which the copyright was in the public domain, and cost the filmmakers $1500. It was originally used in Teenagers from Outer Space (1959).</li><li>When the movie was in its scripting stage, John A. Russo had developed an idea that was basically described as \"teenagers from outer space\". This version was not filmed, but the version that was filmed uses stock music from the movie Teenagers from Outer Space (1959).</li><li>One of the Walter Reade Organization's publicity stunts was a $50,000 insurance policy against anyone dying from a heart attack while watching the film.</li><li>The film's world premiere was at the Fulton Theatre in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 1 October 1968 (At 8PM, admission by invitation only). The film was met with a standing ovation.</li><li>The only real mishap to happen during filming involved producer and actor Russell Streiner's (Johnny's) brother, Gary Streiner. After the scene where 'Duane Jones (I)' sets the chair on fire, it was Gary's responsibility to extinguish the flames and set the chair ablaze again to preserve continuity, ensuring that smoke would be seen emanating from it near the end of the film. At one point Gary's sleeve caught on fire and, as he ran in terror, S. William Hinzman (in full zombie makeup) tackled him to the ground and helped extinguish the flames, saving him from major injury.</li><li>George A. Romero was the one operating the camera when S. William Hinzman (the cemetery zombie) attacks Barbara in her car by smashing the window with a rock. When Hinzman shattered the window, the rock barely missed Romero.</li><li>Some of the groans made by S. William Hinzman when he's wrestling with Russell Streiner in the cemetery are authentic. During the struggle, Streiner accidentally kneed Hinzman in the groin.</li><li>The Evans City Cemetery was the cemetery used in the original version of the film, but it could not be used for the 30th anniversary edition. Before filming the new footage, a tornado had torn through the Evans City Cemetery, and ironically, it unearthed several graves.</li><li>The Chevy truck seen in the new footage is not the same one seen in the original footage. The filmmakers for the new footage were fortunate enough to find a truck owned by a local resident that bore a near-perfect resemblance to the original truck. The owner was kind enough to let them borrow his truck for the film.</li><li>During the filming of the new footage for the 30th anniversary edition, actor/composer Scott Vladimir Licina (Reverend John Hicks) suffered a heat stroke in the cemetery and was hospitalized for a few days.</li><li>The house used for this film was loaned to the filmmakers by the owner, who planned to demolish it anyway, thereby ensuring that they could do whatever they wanted to the house.</li><li>There were two trucks used in the film. The first one used in the beginning of the film would not start for the trek-to-the-gas-pump scenes and had to be replaced. Unfortunately, they forgot to break the headlights.</li><li>While writing the script, George A. Romero and John A. Russo were trying to think of a manner in which to destroy the zombies. Marilyn Eastman joked that they could throw pies in their faces. This is obviously an inspiration for the pie fight scene in this film's sequel, Dawn of the Dead (1978).</li><li>Judith Ridley worked as a receptionist for Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman, which led to her getting the part in the movie.</li><li>Assuming the movie takes place on the spring time change (according to the dialog at the beginning) after the date (December 1966) on the calendar in the house (a reasonable assumption from the condition of the body in the house), the movie begins on the night of 30 April 1967 and ends the next morning, which is May Day.</li><li>The body upstairs in the house was made by director George A. Romero, who used ping-pong balls for the eyes.</li><li>S. William Hinzman based his characteristic saunter (and, subsequently, that of each other zombie) on a film with Boris Karloff, the title of which he could not remember. In that film, Karloff played a man risen from the dead, and walks with a characteristic ungainly saunter.</li><li>According to the George A. Romero commentary track on the Elite laserdisc and DVD version of the film, the original working print and working elements and materials for the film no longer exist - they were destroyed as a result of a flood that filled the basement where the materials were stored (which was the same basement used in the movie).</li><li>At between 51 and 52 minutes into the film, going by the Elite laserdisc/DVD release, there is a very visible jump cut. The distributors wanted some of the \"talky\" bits trimmed down, so, about 6 minutes was cut from a basement scene involving the Coopers. The jump is quite clearly visible because at one point Harry is facing one direction and then immediately in the next frame, he is facing another.</li><li>At the time of the film's release, any work that did not include a copyright notice was assumed to be public domain. Since the film makers forgot to include this notice, the film slipped into the public domain. In was not until 1 March 1989 that a copyright notice was no longer required.</li><li>Screenwriter John A. Russo appears as the ghoul who gets his forehead smashed by Ben with a tire iron. He also allowed himself to be set on fire for real when nobody else wanted to do the stunt.</li><li>The Cooper family are played by a real family. Karl Hardman (husband Harry Cooper) and Marilyn Eastman (wife Helen Cooper) are real-life husband and wife. Kyra Schon (daughter Karen Cooper) is their real-life daughter.</li><li>Contrary to popular rumor, the film was originally shot on 35mm film. The print that passed into the public domain is a grainy 16mm positive, which was used for subsequent prints. The only way to see a 35mm print made from the original 35mm negative is to see the DVD of the Millennium Edition from Elite Media, which was released in 2002.</li><li>This was one of the first films added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress because of naïve business practices that allowed the copyright of the film to slip into the public domain.</li><li>The filmmakers were accused of being \"Satanically-inspired\" by Christian fundamentalist groups for their portrayal of the undead feeding on flesh and of the Coopers' zombie child (Kyra Schon) attacking her mother (Marilyn Eastman).</li><li>One of the original ideas for the script before its many revisions called for Barbara to be a very strong, charismatic character. Instead, George A. Romero and the producers loved 'Judith O'Dea's portrayal as a catatonic and terrified young girl much better, and edited the script to accommodate the part. Eventually, the idea of Barbara being a strong, central character would be revisited in Tom Savini's 1990 remake.</li><li>The stock music that accompanies Barbara's initial flight from the cemetery zombie had been used a year earlier, in the final episode of television's \"The Fugitive\" (1963).</li><li>As George A. Romero explains it on \"The Directors: The Films of George A. Romero\", the day the final editing and voice-over dubbing was complete (4/4/1968), he and John A. Russo literally \"threw\" the film into the trunk of their car and drove to New York to see if anyone wanted to show it. While driving through New York on the night of April 4th, 1968, Romero and Russo heard news on the radio that Martin Luther King had been assassinated.</li><li>The role of Ben was originally meant for Rudy Ricci. After 'Duane Jones (I)' had read the part, however, it was given to him, and Ricci played one of the zombies.</li><li>In the scene where Ben moves the body upstairs to another room, we can see that its face is intact. This was in fact Kyra Schon who doubled as the upstairs body as it was felt that a mannequin would look unrealistic.</li><li>This film is ranked at 9 on Bravo's \"The 100 Scariest Movie Moments\" (2004) (mini) special.</li><li>The social commentary on racism some have seen in this film was never intended (an African-American man holing up in a house with a white woman, a posse of whites shooting a black man in the head without first checking to see if he was a zombie). According to the filmmakers, 'Duane Jones (I)' was simply the best actor for the part of Ben.</li><li>Barbara (Judith O'Dea) was originally meant to be the sole survivor of the zombies' onslaught. This idea is incorporated into the remake of Night of the Living Dead (1990).</li><li>Originally, one idea for the script called for Harry Cooper to die from the gunshot wound received from Ben before his daughter became a zombie, which would have resulted in Helen coming down the stairs to find him eating their daughter, rather than the daughter eating him. It was decided that this would probably be far too disturbing and graphic and was changed back to the idea of the daughter becoming a zombie first.</li></ul>",

Jafar tells Gazeem that he may have the treasures inside, but the lamp is his.</p><p>Just as Gazeem is about to go in, the tiger head warns him that only \"the diamond in the rough\" is worthy to enter.

Disney officially credited the Biblical tales of Joseph and Moses, as well as \"Hamlet\" by William Shakespeare for inspiring several elements of the story. Uncredited were several stylistic and plot elements from \"Kimba the White Lion\" (1965 - 1966), a well-known Japanese animated series. This spawned several accusations of plagiarism.</p>",

Actually she was between ten and twelve years old during their historical meeting. The historical Smith recorded an account of Pocahontas rescuing him from execution at the hands of her father. Its historical accuracy is questionable.</p><p>The film features a theme of racial prejudice blinding people and features songs such as \"Savages\", sung by both the Natives and the settlers as they attack each other. The film was a box office hit but was considered a disappointment for Disney. Since 1989 most Disney feature films had managed to surpass their immediate predecessor both in terms of profit and critical praise. Pocahontas fell rather short of \"Lion King\" and was only the fourth most profitable film of 1995 (behind Toy Story, Batman Forever and Apollo 13).</p>",

    "deck": "An 1996 animated film adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel. Praised for its lavish animation and realistic obsession of Frollo's obsession with Esmeralda. Criticised for making the archedeacon a mere judge and completely avoiding the anti-clerical themes of the novel.",
    "description": "<p>Clopin tells the children the story of the mysterious bell ringer at Notre Dame. <br /> <br />In the night, a gypsy and a man try to get into Paris, but they were trapped by Judge Claude Frollo, the corrupt Minister of Justice. He arrests them, but the gypsy escapes and Frollo chases her through town. She tries to get inside Notre Dame, but to no avail. Frollo kills her by knocking her to the stairs and finds out that she is carrying a baby.<br /> <br />Calling it a monster due to its deformity, Frollo attempts to throw it to the well, but the Archdeacon stops him, telling him that he killed an innocent woman and must raise the baby as his own child. Frollo reluctant agrees with one condition that it will live in Notre Dame.<br /> <br />20 years later, Quasimodo, the hunchback, has become a bell ringer of Notre Dame. He is alone, but has 3 gargoyles Victor, Hugo, and Laverne accompanying him. Quasimodo has a strong desire to go outside and just as he is about to leave, Frollo arrives and asks him who is he talking to. When Quasimodo replies that he is talking to his friends that are stone, Frollo tells him that stone can't talk. <br /> <br />He reviews Quasimodo's alphabet and upon hearing the word festival for F, he reminds Quasimodo about how the people will treat him badly because of his deformity. Quasimodo apologizes and not only Frollo forgives him, but reminds him that Notre Dame is his sanctuary.<br /> <br />Meanwhile, Phoebus walks to the Palace of Justice. He defends a gypsy woman named Esmeralda from the guards. Upon walking to the Palace of Justice, Frollo is seen punishing one of his men. He takes Phoebus to take look at the gypsies, whom Frollo thinks that they're evil and that they must be stopped. Phoebus is skeptical about catching fortune tellers and palm readers. Frollo tells him that the gypsies have a place on their own, the Court of Miracles. When being asked what to do with them, Frollo squishes all of the ants. In other words, kill the gypsies.<br /> <br />In the Festival of Fools, Frollo watches the festival including Esmeralda dancing. While there, he finds Quasimodo being crowned as King of Fools and he is angered that Quasimodo disobeyed him.<br /> <br />When Quasimodo gets into trouble, Frollo refuses to help him. However, Esmeralda helps him and stands up to Frollo that he may speak words of justice, but he is cruel to those who needs his help. Frollo warns Esmeralda that she will pay for her insolence, and Esmeralda smites him by throwing the King of Fools crown to his feet. Enraged, Frollo orders Phoebus to arrest her, but Esmeralda escapes by magic, which Frollo thinks that she is using witchcraft.<br /> <br />Esmeralda is chased by Frollo's men, but she escapes from them. Frollo orders Phoebus to look for Esmeralda alive. Quasimodo goes back to Notre Dame humiliated and rejected. <br /> <br />Inside, Esmeralda gets into a fight with Phoebus. Fortunately for her, he has no intention to arrest her. Frollo arrives and orders Phoebus to arrest Esmeralda. Phoebus tells Esmeralda to say sanctuary, but she refuses because she thinks that Phoebus has betrayed her. When Frollo asks for Esmeralda, Phoebus claims that since she claimed sanctuary in Notre Dame, she can't be harmed. Frollo orders him to drag her outside, but the Archdeacon defends Esmeralda from him by reminding of how Frollo respected the sanctity of the church. <br /> <br />Angered, Frollo and his guards leave, but the former sneaks into Esmeralda from behind when the Archdeacon leave. He begins to grope her, but she gets free. Frollo leaves, but not before warning Esmeralda if she goes outside, he will get her.<br /> <br />Esmeralda encounters Quasimodo inside and apologizes about what happened at the festival. She begins understand Quasimodo and he helped her escape from Frollo. Quasimodo begins to fall in love with her. <br /> <br />In the Palace of Justice, Frollo is fearing that he has lust for Esmeralda and knows that it is one of the Seven Deadly Sins. He fears of going to Hell if he gets into a relationship with her. Just then, he is informed by one of his men that Esmeralda escapes and Frollo swears that he will find her even if he has to burn down Paris. Frollo threatens Esmeralda to either be with him or send her to Hell by burning her to death. <br /> <br />In the next day, Frollo leads a search for Esmeralda. He finds a man harboring gypsies and puts him under house arrest until he is proven innocent. After locking the door of the man's house, Frollo orders Phoebus to burn the house with the man and his family inside, something that he doesn't want to do because he is not trained to murder the innocent. When Frollo tells Phoebus that he is trained to follow his orders, the latter defies the former by putting the torch to a bucket of water. Frollo sets the house on fire.<br /> <br />Phoebus saves the man and his family, but because of this action, Frollo calls him a traitor and tries to execute him, but he is saved by Esmeralda. However, he is shot by one of Frollo's men with an arrow. Frollo orders his men to stop firing, thinking that Phoebus will just die of drowning. Esmeralda saves him. <br /> <br />In Paris, Frollo has began burning houses, but Esmeralda is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br />Inside Notre Dame, Quasimodo is orders to take care of Phoebus. While doing so, he is heartbroken upon seeing Esmeralda and Phoebus declare their love for one another.  <br /> <br />After Esmeralda leaves, Frollo arrives to have dinner with Quasimodo and begins to suspect that he is hiding Phoebus. Frollo sees the figure of Esmeralda, leading him to realize that Quasimodo helped her escape. He pins the blame of burning Paris to Quasimodo and when he tells him that Esmeralda is kind, Frollo abuses him, telling him that it was cunning she uses, and that gypsies are not capable of real love. Frollo tells Quasimodo not to worry as he will try to get Esmeralda out of their lives forever. He tells Quasimodo that he will attack the Court of Miracles at dawn with a thousand men. <br /> <br />Upon hearing the plan, Phoebus leaves. Quasimodo is reluctant to help him because Esmeralda has love for Phoebus, not him. Quasimodo leads Phoebus in a crypt where the Court of Miracles is. <br /> <br />Inside, they were captured by Clopin and thinks they're Frollo's spies. He tries to execute them, but is stopped by Esmeralda. Phoebus warns the gypsies that Frollo is coming to get them and they start packing. However, Frollo manages to corner them, and says that he knew Quasimodo is useful to him someday. <br /> <br />At dawn outside at Notre Dame, Frollo tries to get Esmeralda to choose between being with him or get burned. Inside Notre Dame, Victor, Hugo, and Laverne try to encourage Quasimodo to escape, but he gives up knowing that Frollo has won. However, upon seeing Esmeralda is gonna get burned, Quasimodo escapes and rescues her. <br /> <br />Frollo demands his men to seize the cathedral and to break down the door. Phoebus escapes and convinces all of Paris to turn against Frollo since his methods are really going too far.<br /> <br />Quasimodo has placed molten lead at Notre Dame, but Frollo manages to get inside. The Archdeacon is enraged at Frollo's attack at the cathedral and demands him to stop it, but Frollo tosses him aside from the stairs and locks the door so that he can't interfere. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Quasimodo finds Esmeralda unconscious, and thinks she's dead. Just then, Frollo arrives and pretends to have remorse in killing Esmeralda. Just as he is about to kill Quasimodo, he struggles with Frollo and is enraged about telling him that the world is cruel place, but now Quasimodo learns that the only thing that is bad in the world is people like Frollo. <br /> <br />Quasimodo finds Esmeralda is okay and Frollo pulls out his sword, intending to kill both of them. While fighting, Frollo admits to Quasimodo that he killed his mother and he will do one thing he should have done in 20 years ago: killing Quasimodo. He uses his cape at Quasimodo and tries to send him falling to his death, but Quasimodo grabs on to the cape and pulls Frollo. While Esmeralda is trying to pull Quasimodo, Frollo stands to one of the gargoyles and tries to kill the two, but the gargoyle comes to life and Frollo falls to his death. <br /> <br />Just as Quasimodo is about to fall, he is saved by Phoebus and accepts the relationship between him and Esmeralda. <br /> <br />Outside, Quasimodo is declared a hero by everyone in Paris.</p>",

    "description": "<p>    </p><div class=\"js-item-cage\"> <center></center></div> <p>  </p> <p>The irrate principal warns Goofy that his son may be on his way to a criminal record. Goofy concludes that his son is involved in gang-related activities. He decides to take Max to an extended trip, partly in hopes of bonding with him and to get him away from \"crime\". Max has to endure the well-meaning but  disastrous ideas of Goofy concerning vacationing spots and still find a way to impress Roxanne and have a summer romance. <br /> <br />The film did relatively well on cinemas but received mixed reviews. While Goofy's concern over his son does add new dimensions to the character, critics felt that he came off as overbearing. Neither Goof attempts to have a honest conversation until very late in the film.  <br /> <br />Pete and PJ, regulars in Goof Troop, have significant roles. But neither seen nor mentioned are Peg and Pistol. Respectively Pete's wife and daughter, they were the female leads of Goof Troop.</p>",
