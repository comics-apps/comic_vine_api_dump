Hancock follows the life of a hard living superhuman who has suddenly decided that he doesn't care what the public thinks of him and chooses to do things his own way. After saving the life of a public relations professional named Ray, he suddenly finds himself questioning his own morals as Ray attempts to change him and give him a better public image. Ray works tirelessly trying to show Hancock the way to the people's hearts. His plan includes Hancock turning himself into the police and actually gaining some proper manners. After a few weeks in prison the police commissioner decides he needs Hancock's help, which exactly what Hancock needs. He suddenly becomes and Icon of the city as he is now cleaned up and got his act together. Ray decides to celebrate the occasion by taking Hancock out to a nice dinner. After Ray drinks so much he can't drive home Hancock takes him home, at which point Hancock begins to fall for Ray's wife, Mary. As he goes in for a kiss Mary thrust Hancock out of the house revealing that Hancock is not the only one with powers. Finally after a short battle it is revealed that Mary is Hancock's wife, and that they are centuries old. It is also revealed that they are the last of their kind because all of the rest of their kind paired up and died, which reveals that if Hancock and Mary are close for to long their powers fade away giving them the opportunity to live normal lives. Eventually the man that Hancock put away last breaks free of prison and decides to end Hancock. The man nearly succeeds as both Hancock and Mary have lost most of their powers. </p>",

    "deck": "In a countryside town bordering on a magical land, a young man makes a promise to his beloved that he'll retrieve a fallen star by venturing into the magical realm.",
    "description": "<p> The English village of Wall lies near a stone wall that is a border with the kingdom of Stormhold in another, magical world. A guard is constantly posted at a hole in the wall to prevent anyone from crossing. In the capital of Stormhold, the king is on his deathbed. He throws a ruby into the sky, decreeing that the first of his fratricidal<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fratricidal\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> sons to recover it will be the new king. The gem collides with a star, and they fall together and land elsewhere in Stormhold. The king's remaining two sons, Primus and Septimus, independently search for the gem. </p><p>In Wall, Tristan Thorne sees the star fall behind the wall, and vows to retrieve it for the object of his infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. His father reveals to him that his mother is from the other side of the wall, and gives him a Babylon candle that she had left for him, which instantly transports the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He promptly chains her in order to take her home to Victoria.</p> <p>Three witches in Stormhold learn of the fallen star and resolve to find her, intending to eat her heart in order to recover their youth and replenish their magical power. One of the witches, Lamia, sets a trap for Yvaine, magically conjuring an inn in the countryside.</p> <p>Yvaine is weary and unaccustomed to daytime travel, so Tristan chains her to a tree and promises to return with food. In his absence, a unicorn frees Yvaine, then unwittingly takes her to Lamia's inn. Tristan discovers Yvaine gone and lies down to rest. The stars whisper to Tristan, warning of Yvaine's danger and begging him to save her, instructing him to get on a passing stagecoach which happens to be Primus's.</p> <p>Tristan and Primus arrive at the inn, interrupting Lamia's attempt to kill Yvaine. Lamia kills Primus, but Tristan and Yvaine escape using the Babylon candle. Because they're each thinking of their respective homes, the candle takes Tristan and Yvaine into the storm clouds, between the earth and the stars, where they are captured by pirates in a flying ship. They befriend the kind-hearted Captain Shakespeare, who teaches Tristan how to fence <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and fight, and gives him a haircut which lengthens his hair.</p> <p>Septimus arrives at the site of the inn and discovers that he is the last surviving son of the king, only needing to find the stone to accept the throne. He learns that it is in the possession of the fallen star and that the heart of a star grants immortality<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>.</p> <p>After leaving Captain Shakespeare's ship, Tristan and Yvaine make their way to a village near the wall, where they spend the night at an inn. Come morning, Tristan leaves Yvaine sleeping and goes to Wall, bringing with him a lock of her hair, to tell Victoria that he won't marry her, having fallen in love with Yvaine. When the lock turns to stardust, he realizes that Yvaine will die if she crosses the wall, and he rushes back to save her.</p> <p>Yvaine wakes up to find Tristan gone, and she starts walking toward the wall, believing that he abandoned her to go back to Victoria. Tristan's mother, Una, notices Yvaine walking to her doom, so she takes her caravan <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardo_(gypsy_wagon)\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to the wall to stop her. Lamia arrives and captures both Yvaine and Una, taking them to the witches' castle.</p> <p>Septimus and Tristan both pursue Lamia and meet at the castle, agreeing to work together for the time being. Barging into the witches' castle, Septimus recognizes Una as his sister, daughter of the king. Una and Tristan meet for the first time, and she informs him that she is his mother.</p> <p>Septimus and Tristan fight the witches, but Lamia kills Septimus using a voodoo doll<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_doll\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, then uses it to make his corpse fight Tristan. Just as Lamia is about to kill Tristan, Yvaine, more in love with Tristan than ever, unleashes a wave of starlight that disintegrates Lamia.</p> Tristan retrieves the jewel that Yvaine was wearing. Una explains that Tristan is the last male heir of Stormhold. Tristan becomes the new king with Yvaine as his queen. Later, after eighty years of ruling Stormhold, they both use a Babylon candle to ascend to the sky, where Tristan also becomes a star. Since Yvaine \"gave her heart\" to Tristan, the two will live forever in the sky .",

    "description": "<p>The movie opens up with a bounty, named Red, who comes into town wanting a refill for his whiskey. It begins with the credits, and him shooting a dog in the head which annoyed him. When Red walks into the bar, he boasts about how he can whip any man, and ride anything. The people in the bar don't make eye-contact with him, they just go about their business. When Red goes to the bartender, he gets \"the good stuff\" and tells him to leave. Once Madame Lorraine comes down, she sees Red. She tells him that he can have some \"fun\" up stairs. So he follows her up stairs. When Red gets comfy in the bed, he says to Madam, you think I'm to drunk, while this is true, unknown to him Madam has a small hidden gun on her right leg. She comes closer to Red and shoots him twice in the stomach. Two drunk guys outside here the gun fire and start shooting in the air. Madam gets money from his pocket, and tells her two accomplices to take away the body. <br /> <br />Eventually (a day or so later), Jonah Hex comes into town. Everyone stops to look at the famed and feared bounty hunter. When Jonah stops at the bar to see if anyone saw the bounty named Red, a young boy comes to challenge Hex. The boy says he can shoot 6 cans in a row and not miss a single can, he then says \"I can take you.\" Swallowing quickly. Jonah stops, with fear running down the boys head, Jonah quickly turns around. The boy gasps, and Jonah hits him right in the mouth with his gun; and then walks into the bar. Jonah walks up to the Bartender and asks if he has seen Red. The bartender lies and says, that he hasn't seen him. Jonah gets a beer, and then a bar girl comes and talks with him. She says that she has seen him, the bar girl tells Jonah that Madam Lorraine takes them up to her room, and there never seen again.  <br /> <br />All the bar girl wanted was enough money to leave town, so Jonah (as a gentleman) gives her over $1000 dollars in cash. The bar girl gives Jonah a kiss on the cheek and says, Thanks. Jonah talks to the bartender again and tells him to give a drink to everyone here (Jonah pays for all of their drinks). Madam Lorraine tells Jonah that he can have some real fun up stairs, Jonah follows and then the two accomplices follow in a secret door way. Jonah asks if she has seen a \"dead man\", Madam simply replies, Me see a dead person? Madam reaches for her gun, and pulls it at Jonah, however, Jonah throws his hat and hits the gun out of her hand. Then he jumps on her, Madam says \"You wouldn't hit a lady?\" Jonah says, \"You ain't no lady.\" and punches her in the face. <br /> <br />The two accomplices come out, one with an axe, and another with a gun. The one with the gun starts shooting at Jonah, after Jonah kills him, the axe guy throws the axe at him. Once Jonah dodges the axe, the guy starts punching him in the face. A dazed Jonah, the axe guy reaches for his axe and tries to kill Jonah. However, Jonah kicks him in a, hmm, Particular place and hits the axe guy with the wooden part (where you hold the axe) in his face. Then Hex kicks him and the guy lands on a heater, which burns a little part of his left side face. Then Hex throws him downstairs. The bartender then starts shooting at Hex with a shotgun, Hex shoots him and says to everyone, \"Drinks are on the house.\" Everyone scatters to the bar to get drunk for free. <br /> <br />After that, Jonah goes back into Madam's room. He takes a gun and says, I'm only going to ask this once. Madam takes Jonah to Red. After they travel a long distance they finally arrive at the spot that Red is at. Jonah sends Madam down first, then goes down himself. Hex strikes a match and sees the hundreds of bounty's that Madam Lorraine has killed. Jonah finds Red's body and Lorraine gets a knife she sees on the ground. She tries to kill Jonah a second time, however he hits her and throws her to the wall. Jonah goes up with his bounty and leaves Madam Lorraine. She says, You can't leave me here! Jonah replies, you're not alone, you know everybody in the room. As the light fades, Madam Lorraine gets scared at being alone. This is the end of the movie. </p>",

At the grand opening of the Coolsville Museum, the Evil Masked Figure releases the recreated Pterodactyl Ghost (flying reptile). The gang tries to capture the reptile, but it flies out the window with the Evil Masked Figure in tow, because Shaggy and Scooby forget to tie the rope. The gang embarks on an investigation of how this reptile came to life. Shaggy and Scooby go on their own to prove that they are real detectives and not mess-ups. The gang discovers that the Evil Masked Figure has built a machine that was used to regenerate the reptile, and he is about to bring back other monsters such as the Black Knight, Captain Cutler's Ghost, and the 10,000 Volt Ghost. The Evil Masked Figure wants to destroy the reputations of the detectives at Mystery Inc. and take over Coolsville </p>",

    "description": "<p>The movie opens with a scene of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\" href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\">Gotham City</a> and a news report. We got <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8264\" href=\"/vicki-vale/4005-8264/\">Vicki Vale</a> reporting the latest events seen in Public Enemies, as the meteor <a data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\" href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\">Kryptonite</a> shower and the leftovers of the debris have moved beyond Earths orbit.</p><p>The story continues as we see what believed to be a meteor coming down near Gothams harbor. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\">Dark Knight</a> makes his appearance and as the world greatest detective, he goes in for an investigation. During his investigation, he comes across a space ship with Kryptonian letter written on it, surrounded by a handful of glowing green stones. A female appears to come out of the waters, climbing herself on Batman's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55691\" href=\"/batboat/4055-55691/\">Batboat</a>. Accidentally activating it, the engines go online and the Batboat explodes by the harbors docks.</p><p>The female seems to be approaching a couple of guys in the back of an alley. The guys start teasing her when a foreign language is spoken, believed by the alley guys to be Swedish. It's actually Kryptonese. The girl attacks the guys while they approach her, whilst one of the guys is offering his coat. Running away, Batman appears in the alley. Wandering all around Gotham streets, she's surrounded by police men. While her eyes seem to be burning, heat vision is being set on, making one of the police cars explode. Escaping the police, she takes a leap on a car and while she seems to be hovering, police men fire at her. At her surprise, she finds Batman on top of a building. After attacking him, she flies away towards one of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42090\" href=\"/gotham-city-police-department/4060-42090/\">GCPD</a>'s aircraft, causing a big explosion. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\">Man of Steel</a> appears to save the moment, stopping the aircraft from causing any accidents by throwing it away into Gotham City's harbor waters.</p><p>The girl all lonely crying by the floor of an abandoned building is approached by Batman, when he takes out a Kryptonite rock and powers her down. We follow Batman into the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-31340\" href=\"/batcave/4020-31340/\">Batcave</a>, with the girl strapped down, being examined by Batman's high-technology equipment. It appears that her DNA is not human. All of a sudden, releasing herself from the chains, she blasts off her heat vision towards Batman. Superman appears to be calming her down by speaking the same language with her. It is then revealed that the girl is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\" href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\">Kara Zor-El</a>, Superman's cousin from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-30670\" href=\"/krypton/4020-30670/\">Krypton</a>.</p><p>The movie continues with Superman and Batman in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41185\" href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/\">Fortress of Solitude</a>, examining Kara's space ship. On it, it is written with Kryptonian letters, <i>\"This vessel contains my daughter Kara Zor-El from the now dead planet krypton. Treat her as you would your own child, she would prove a treasure for your world \"</i>. Batman making sure the translation was not wrong, warns Superman that her structure is different from his, and she might be stronger than him. Kara then breaks down the door of the room Superman and Batman were in, flying scared behind them. It is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8332\" href=\"/krypto/4005-8332/\">Krypto</a> that was chasing Kara. Superman then calms Krypto down while Batman is insecure of Kara's sudden appearance, and that she might be dangerous having no control over her powers. Clark confesses that she may be the only blood relative he has left, and he should not worry.</p><p>Kara is walking herself around the Hall of Krypton while trying to reason with Batman spying on her and why he doesn't like her. She then tells him a story from her youth. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9561\" href=\"/jor-el/4005-9561/\">Jor-El</a>, being like a father to her, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9562\" href=\"/lara-lor-van/4005-9562/\">Lara Lor-Van</a>, both believed that the planet Krypton was doomed, which is why her father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-35409\" href=\"/zor-el/4005-35409/\">Zor-El</a>, built also a ship with the navigation system locked on Earth, and that him and her <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31100\" href=\"/alura/4005-31100/\">mother</a> would soon follow. She saw them die, followed by an awful blistering light. After those events, all she remembered was darkness and how the asteroid carried her across Earth and landed on Gotham. Batman asks her if she remembers her mothers name which she does not. Batman tells her that her cousin, Kal-El, has a lot of enemies who would do anything to destroy him and she might unintentionally hurt him. Kara leaves by saying to him that she thought she sensed him before because of his heart beat but she was wrong. She tells him that he has no heart.</p><p>The movie continues as we are transferred into the deep pits of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\" href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\">Apokolips</a>. We see <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3629\" href=\"/granny-goodness/4005-3629/\">Granny Goodness</a> talking to a female , addressing her as one of the finest warriors of Apokolips. The test that will prove her loyalty alongside mighty <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\" href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\">Darkseid</a> is set as Granny Goodness calls in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41295\" href=\"/female-furies/4060-41295/\">Furies</a> against her. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3634\" href=\"/stompa/4005-3634/\">Stompa</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3632\" href=\"/lashina/4005-3632/\">Lashina</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3633\" href=\"/mad-harriet/4005-3633/\">Mad Harriet</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15753\" href=\"/gilotina/4005-15753/\">Gilotina</a> make their appearance. While the female warrior lays down dead after the battle, Darkseid sneaks into Granny Goodness, expressing his disappointment. He then orders her to bring him the girl that fell out of the sky or it will be her the Furies will face next. Time sets back to Earth as we see Harbinger envisioning Kara's death.</p><p>We see Clark and Kara walking around <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\" href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\">Metropolis</a> with her expressing her feelings of how much more she likes Metropolis over the Fortress of Solitude. Clark tries to teach her as much as possible of what it is like to be an Earth girl by taking her shopping. Later on, walking through Metropolis' parks, Clark explains to Kara that Bruce is not that bad once she gets to know him, and that adapting to a new culture is difficult. Clark also explains to her about his secret identity and the reason for wearing glasses; that being the importance for Superheroes keeping their identity secret. While Kara realizes how the world sees her cousin, by seeing the Superman statue, she feels it's a responsibility that frightens her and she doesn't want to be anybody's champion. Clark and Kara are suddenly attacked. Superman tries to save her when he realizes it's <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42494\" href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/4060-42494/\">Amazons</a> trying to capture Kara for her own good and to teach her how to use her super powers with responsibility. Batman tells Superman that there's also another reason behind this.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4020-56187\" href=\"/paradise-island/4020-56187/\">Paradise Island</a>, the home of the Amazons. While <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14626\" href=\"/harbinger/4005-14626/\">Harbinger</a> is summoned for the battle of Kara and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2359\" href=\"/artemis/4005-2359/\">Artemis</a>, she is once again experiencing visions of Kara's death. Superman tells Batman that he can't understand the point of everything that's happening when Wonder Woman takes place by telling him that there is a difference between having a power and how to use it. Kara seems to be loosing the battle when Superman intervenes by stopping Artemis, with Kara explaining to him that she wasn't going to hurt her. Superman tries to reason with Wonder Woman and Kara that she needs to get back to Metropolis and see what the rest of the world has to offer her. Superman expresses his fear about the visions Harbinger is having, when Batman turns against him on how he's let his guard down since Kara showed up. Kara flies away with Harbinger, while they discuss about their lives, and that she can always seek for Wonder Woman's help, like Harbinger did.</p><p>While Wonder Woman explains to Superman that Paradise Island is the better place for Kara at that moment, a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41472\" href=\"/boom-tube/4055-41472/\">Boom Tube</a> appears with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9989\" href=\"/doomsday/4005-9989/\">Doomsday</a> coming out of it. To their surprise, the tube isn't closing and more <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8331\" href=\"/doomsday-clones/4005-8331/\">Doomsday clones</a> come out if it. It is then when Superman realizes it is Darkseid's plan, and that he had replicated Doomsday. Amazons are summoned and a big battle scene follows. Wonder Woman realizes that the monsters are not spilling any blood, meaning they are not alive. Superman orders Wonder Woman and the Amazon to step back and with a super blast of heat vision destroys the army of Doomsday's. During the battle Batman is the one who realizes that this whole attack was a distraction and the main target was Kara. Superman discovers a lifeless body in the sea, believing it to be Kara. It is revealed that the body is Lyla, Harbinger. It's then when the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57587\" href=\"/trinity/4060-57587/\">Trinity</a> team makes the decision to go to Apokolips and face Darkseid. A small scene on Apokolips follows where Kara gets imprisoned while Darkseid tries to show her the benefits of being the captain of the Furies and the power she will be able to uphold.</p><p>Back to Earth. Superman and Wonder Woman drop by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3628\" href=\"/big-barda/4005-3628/\">Big Barda</a>'s house. Batman already inside her house mentions that she already defeated Darkseid before. Asking for her help, Barda tells them that Kara is already lost and will be manipulated by Darkseid, like he did with her. Finally convinced to help them, Big Barda suits up and is willing to join them. Everyone seems to disagree with her decision but it turns out it is the only way as Big Barda had experience with Apokolips and Darkseid. A Boom Tube is activated and Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Big Barda find themselves on the grounds of Apokolips.</p><p>The first move against them is engaged by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57182\" href=\"/parademons/4060-57182/\">Parademons</a>. After they are being defeated (the Parademons), the team splits up. Wonder Woman and Big Barda follow the low road through the sewers when Big Barda mentions what a great inspiration Wonder Woman is to her. Granny Goodness shows up with the Furies and the battle begins. After a long battle, Big Barda is captured. Granny Goodness forces Wonder Woman to surrender herself when Big Barda says she would rather sacrifice herself instead. Getting herself released with the help of Wonder Woman, they defeat the Furies and capture Granny Goodness. At the same time Batman is attacked by the Demon Dogs. Defeating them, he finds himself in a room full of Hellspores when he realizes their power is enough to destroy the planets core. Superman reaches Darkseid's throne, demanding Kara to leave back home with him. Kara already having been brainwashed attacks her cousin by telling him she doesn't want to leave, when after Darkseid orders her to kill him. Superman eventually decides to fight back, trying to explain to Kara that Darkseid is using her and that she won't be free even if she kills him. In turn, Batman faces Darkseid. After telling him the code and that he reprogrammed his Hellspores, convincing him that he is not bluffing, Darkseid attacks him but it's not long after that he realizes that Batman is his only hope of deactivating the Hellspores preventing the planets destruction. Darkseid releases Kara by telling Batman that if it weren't for his plan, all would be lost.</p><p>Kara wakes up back in Paradise Island, realizing the loss of her friend Lyla. Superman explains to her the way Darkseid works, by breaking people's spirit. Kara, standing in front of Lyla's monument, opens up her heart and promises that she will not disappoint her. Before leaving Paradise Island she tells Batman her mother's name and that she now remembers. Clark with Kara drive back to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55733\" href=\"/smallville/4020-55733/\">Smallville</a> where he wants her to meet his parents. Little did they know, Darkseid had been expecting them inside the Kents house. Blasting his omega beems towards Superman, Kara jumps in to save her cousin. A great battle follows with Kara and Darkseid. Superman regains his consciousness after Darkseids beating, facing him one last time before throwing him inside a Boom Tube and back to Apokolips. Kara then tells him that she reconfigured the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41473\" href=\"/mother-box/4055-41473/\">Mother Box</a> and Darkseid was sent floating in space where will no longer be a threat. With the battle having come to an end, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55792\" href=\"/kent-family/4060-55792/\">Kent family</a> arrives only to find a place that looks like a war field.</p><p>Back to Paradise Island, everyone is gathered around, while Superman is giving a speech. He then takes the liberty to re-introduce his cousin, Kara Zor-El, or as the world would come to know her, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\" href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\">Supergirl</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In Phoenix, <a href=\"/arizona/4020-55753/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55753\">Arizona</a> Marion Crane tells her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, about getting married. One day, while doing her job, she stole $40, 000 from her boss and drives away.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At one night, Marion gets into trouble with a police officer who is suspicious of her agitated behavior. He lets her go, but follows her while she's driving. Knowing this, Marion switches her car with a different one.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One rainy night, she stops into a motel, Bates Motel, for the night. She tries to call on the owner of the motel by honking the horn of her car. Norman Bates arrives and tells her to go inside his office. When she asks him if he has a vacancy, Norman replies that he has 12 vacancies and gives her a key to room 1.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Inside, he tells Marion to have dinner with him, but it is nothing special about that, and leaves. While she is trying to hide the money she stole, Marion hears the argument between Norman and his mother, who refuses to allow him to have dinner with her.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Because of that, Norman decided to have dinner with Marion at his office. In his office, Norman tells Marion about his taxidermy skills and his mother.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Back at her motel room, Marion takes a shower. While doing so, she is stabbed to death by a mysterious figure.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Norman comes screaming that his mother is cover with blood and runs to Marion's room to find her murdered. He begins to clean up the mess and throw away her body and possessions (including the money) to the river.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The next day, Sam is contacted by Lila, Marion's sister, about her disappearance. Just then, Detective Milton Arbogast came to them and reveals that he is hired by Marion's boss to get his money back. He suggested that they work together to find her.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Arbogast goes to the Bates Motel to question Norman about Marion's disappearance. Suspecting that his mother is responsible, Norman tries to protect her by lying through Arbogast's questions. While questioning Norman, Arbogast sees a figure sitting in a chair and asks him who is it. Norman replies that it is his mother.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The detective calls Sam and Lila that he is planning to go to Norman's house to meet his mother. However, he is stabbed to death by the same figure while doing so.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Because of Arbogast's disappearance, Sam and Lila go to Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers, who tells them that Norman's mother is dead 10 years ago. He contacts Norman if there is any trouble and the reply is that there is no trouble. Chambers is puzzled about the figure in Norman's house.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Knowing that his mother will be in trouble, Norman hides his mother to the fruit cellar, which something she doesn't like to hide.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The next day, posing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check in to the Bates Motel and search Marion's room where they find the paper written $40, 000. Sam distracts Norman while Lila searches his house for his mother. However, the conversation between Norman and Sam becomes sour when the latter suggested that the former killed Marion to get her money and buy a new motel. Realizing that Lila is missing, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and goes to his house.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Marion hides to the basement as Norman goes upstairs. In the basement, she sees the corpse of Norman's mother and Norman comes to her dressed with a wig and dress, and holding a knife. He tries to kill her, but Sam restrains Norman.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In a police station, Dr. Fred Richmond, a psychiatrist, reveals Norman's origins. He reveals to Sam and Lila that he got the story not from Norman, but his mother's split personality, and that she completely took over Norman from the beginning.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is revealed that when Norman was a kid, he is abused by his mother. After the death of his father, Norman and his mother lived together as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother gets a lover, Norman becomes jealous as he thinks that she pushed him away for her lover. Enraged, Norman poisons his mother and her lover. However, because he is dominated by his mother, Norman steals her corpse and preserved it. This explains of how Norman gets the split personality of his mother. While he is his mother, Norman would act like she was. Because Norman is jealous of his mother for having a lover, his mother would be jealous of him for having a lover. For Richmond's case, Marion. Because Norman is aroused by her, he wanted to have her, but his mother personality wouldn't allow that so Norman kills Marion under her influence. Then Norman, unaware of his mother's personality, cleans up the mess.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Sam asks Richmond why is Norman dressed as his mother, Richmond replies that this is to keep the illusion of his mother being alive to stay alive.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Richmond concludes that if a mind has two personalities, there is always a battle between them. For Norman's case, his mother's personality has won. When Sam asks him about the money, Richmond replies that the money is a crime of passion, not profit.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In a cell, Norman, as his mother, thinks about how is he gonna be blamed for the murders and he will prove that he is harmless by refusing to swat a fly in his hand. As he makes an evil grin, a hot is shown of Marion's car being carried from the swamp.</p>",

    "deck": "An insane barber, Sweeney Todd, kills his victims by slitting their throats and drops them at the basement as Mrs. Lovett bakes pies out of them.",
    "description": "<p>The movie begins with a man named Sweeney Todd going to London with a help from a sailor, Anthony Hope. While sailing, Todd reveals that he is once used to be a barber who has everything, but the corrupt Judge Turpin took his wife, Lucy, away from him.<br /> <br />Inside her store, Mrs. Lovett serves Todd with pie. Then, she reveals about Benjamin Barker's wife that she is raped by Turpin when she is forced to go to his party. Todd screams about it, leading Lovett to realize that he is Barker. When Todd asks where his wife and daughter, Johanna are, Lovett replies that his wife took poison while his daughter is raised by Turpin to be his ward. Angered, Todd swears revenge. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Anthony is gandering at Johanna at Turpin's house. Turpin, enraged by what Anthony has done, orders him out. Nevertheless, Anthony still wants to have Johanna. <br /> <br />Todd and Lovett comes to a barber known as Signor Adolf Pirelli. He challenges him to shave-off and Todd wins. He offers Turpin's henchman, Beadle Bamford, an address of his place. <br /> <br />In his barber store, Todd and Lovett see Pirelli and Toby, his protege, going to his place. He orders her to keep Toby distracted while he deals with Pirelli. <br /> <br />Pirelli greets Todd and reveals his real name: Davy Collins. He orders Todd to give his money back because he entered the shaving contest in a false pretense and that he knows who Todd is. Pirelli tells Todd that he is once used to be his protege and how he remembers Todd's razors, explaining how he ended up discovering Todd's identity. He blackmails Todd into giving his money back or he will tell his secret to the Beadle. Enraged, Todd bludgeons him with a teapot. <br /> <br />By the time Toby arrives, Todd places Pirelli to a trunk. He offers Toby a tot of gin so that he wouldn't go after Pirelli. When Toby leaves, Todd slits Pirelli's throat, killing him. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Turpin is punishing a young boy by sentence him to be hanged. Outside of court, the Beadle suggests Turpin to shave in order to propose to Johanna. <br /> <br />Lovette goes to Todd's barber shop and asks him how long Pirelli will be back. Todd replies that he won't be back because he killed him. Lovett steals Pirelli's wallet afterwards. When Turpin comes, Todd is about to kill him until Anthony, unaware of Turpin, comes revealing his plot to have sex with Johanna. Angered by that, Turpin leaves and never returning to Todd's shop. <br /> <br />Enraged that Turpin escapes, Todd swears to kill everyone who comes to his shop until he gets to him. Lovett supports him by suggesting of baking pies from people's corpses. <br /> <br />Since then, on one night, Todd turns his chair into a contraption to drop people to Lovett's basement and begins to kill people until he gets to Turpin. Meanwhile, Turpin sends Johanna away to an asylum when she refuses to be with him. <br /> <br />In one day, Todd and Lovett are having a picnic. After the picnic, Anthony reveals to Todd that Johanna is sent in an asylum, giving him an opportunity of sending Turpin to his store and kill him. Todd orders Anthony to get her out and Toby to give a letter to Turpin. Anthony, suspicious of Todd, reluctantly agrees. <br /> <br />At the night, Anthony begins to have suspicions about Todd and after seeing Pirelli's wallet, he thinks that he is murdered and asks Lovett, whom he didn't know that she is involved with the killings, to join him at investigating Todd. Lovett locks Anthony to her basement for Todd to kill him. <br /> <br />In the asylum, Anthony rescues Johanna and leaves a psychiatrist at the mercy of his patients. <br /> <br />The Beadle goes to Todd's shop to investigate about the smoke in the chimney. Todd kills him in front of Toby, getting him scared and hides to the sewers. Todd and Lovett try to find him, but to no avail. <br /> <br />Just then, Anthony leaves Johanna as she hides to a trunk. A beggar woman enters to the shop and recognizes Todd. At the sound of Turpin's voice, Todd kills her and drops her to the basement. Turpin arrives and Todd kills him, but not before he reveals his true identity to him. He finds a disguised Johanna and not recognizing her, prepares to kill her when he hears Lovett screaming. Todd orders Johanna to forget his face and leaves. <br /> <br />In the basement, Lovett is struggling with Turpin. Todd comes and asks her what is she screaming about and Lovett replies that Turpin tries to grab onto her. Todd is about to burn his corpse with the beggar woman. However, he finds out that the beggar woman is his wife, Lucy. Lovett reveals more detail that she is not killed by the poison, but driven insane and becomes a beggar. <br /> <br />Enraged, Todd pretends to forgive Lovett and waltz her maniacally before throwing her to the oven. Todd cradles for his wife when Toby, now knows everything, goes behind him. Knowing this, Todd orders Toby to slit his throat. Toby leaves afterwards.</p>",

There, the evil tyrant, Odius, takes a shine to the woman and has the guys enslaved as galley rowers using the excuse of the three druggists helping a rebel leader, Ulysses, escape. The rigors of the rowing pump Schuyler up into a muscleman with strength comparable to Hercules himself, who is in the employ of Odius. The threesome get the idea of raising money by promoting Schuyler as Hercules for a series of physical contests. Using a combination of his great strength and, a judicious use of a large supply of potent tranquilizers Curly-Joe brought with him, Schuyler is a success. However, this leads to trouble when the real McCoy learns about the imposter</p>",

It's about Jack Griffin, a scientist who discovers how to become invisible, however, he cannot change back and so he becomes insane with power and decides to use his invisibility powers for evil. Griffin is considered one of the classic Universal Monsters.",

Never leaving his quarters, the stranger demands that the staff leave him completely alone.  <br/> <br/>However, his dark secret is slowly revealed to his suspicious landlady and the villagers: he is an invisible man. When the innkeeper (Forrester Harvey) and his semi-hysterical wife (Una O'Connor) tell him to leave after he makes a huge mess in the parlor and drives away the other patrons, he tears off the bandages, laughing maniacally, and throws the innkeeper down the stairs.  <br/> <br/>He takes off the rest of his clothes, rendering himself completely invisible, and tries to strangle a police officer. <br/></p> <p>The invisible stranger is revealed as Dr. Jack Griffin (Claude Rains), a scientist who has discovered the secret of invisibility while conducting a series of tests with a strange new drug called \"monocane\".  <br/>He returns to the laboratory of his mentor, Dr. Cranley (Henry Travers), where he reveals his secret to his fiancee Flora Cranley (Gloria Stuart), Dr. Cranley's daughter, and to his one-time partner Dr. Kemp (William Harrigan).  <br/>Monocane has rendered Griffin's entire body undetectable to the human eye; alas, it also has the side-effect of driving Griffin insane.  <br/>Cranley has investigated and discovered a single note about monocane (Griffin has burnt all his other papers to cover his tracks) in a now empty cupboard in Griffin's empty laboratory, and realizes that Griffin has recently used it.  <br/>On the evening of his escape from the inn, Griffin turns up in Kemp's living room and imprisons him in his own house.  <br/>He forces Kemp to be his partner again, and together they go back to the inn where Griffin stayed and retrieve his notebooks on the invisibility process.  <br/>While there, he picks up a wooden stool and cracks the police officer over the head, killing him. <br/></p> <p>Kemp calls Cranley, asking for help, and then secretly calls the police.  <br/>Flora comes to him and they talk for only a minute, until the police show up.  <br/>Their conversation reveals that the two are completely devoted to each other, and she is as infatuated with him as he her.  <br/>In Flora's presence, Griffin becomes more placid, and calls her \"darling\".  <br/>He rants about power, but when he realises Kemp betrayed him to the police through the window, his first reaction is getting Flora to flee, and out of danger. She begs to let her stay, but he insists she has nothing to do but leave.  <br/>After promising Kemp that at 10:00 PM the next night he will murder him, Griffin escapes again and goes on a spree of terror, running down the streets killing, robbing, and reciting nursery rhymes in a malicious voice.  <br/>The police offer a monetary award for anyone who can think of a way to catch the Invisible Man.</p> <p>  <br/>They disguise Kemp as a police officer and lead him away from his house to protect him, but Griffin has been following them all along.  <br/>He forces Kemp into the front seat of his car with his hands tied and releases the emergency brake.  <br/>The car rolls down a steep hill, over a cliff, and explodes. <br/></p> <p>Finally, after derailing a train and throwing off a cliff two men who are searching for him with the police as volunteers, Griffin rests in a barn.  <br/>The owner of the barn hears the sleeping Griffin stirring and sees the hay in which Griffin is sleeping inexplicably moving.  <br/>The farmer goes to the police and tells them that \"there's breathing\" his barn.  <br/>The police surround and set fire to the barn.  <br/>When Griffin comes out, the police sight his footprints in the snow and open fire, mortally wounding him.  <br/>Griffin is taken to hospital where, on his deathbed, he admits to Flora that he has tampered with a type of science that was meant to be left alone.  <br/>The effects of the monocane wear off the moment he dies, and he becomes visible once again.    </p>",

Xavier saves Lensherr from drowning and introduces him to the CIA's secret \"Division X\" facility run by an unknown agent. While there, they meet the young scientist <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Hank Mccoy</a>, a large- footed mutant who Xavier outs. Mccoy starts talking to Raven and promises her that he will find a cure for their appearance and find a way for them to look \"normal\".</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1664119-33a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1664119\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 575px\" data-ratio=\"0.42434782608696\" data-width=\"575\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1664119-33a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1664119\"><img alt=\"Cerebro is used for the first time\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/40/1664119-33a.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1664119-33a.jpg 575w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/40/1664119-33a.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cerebro is used for the first time\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/40/1664119-33a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1664119-33a.jpg 575w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/40/1664119-33a.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cerebro is used for the first time</figcaption></figure><p>Hank introduces a machine called <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a> to Xavier that will help him track down and find mutants across the world to recruit into the team to stop Shaw.

The night before the fleet arrive, Xavier and the other mutants make their way to the blockade line to stop the fleet and reveal themselves.

Lensherr stops the missiles in mid-air and turns them on the fleet. Xavier struggles with Erik to stop him killing innocent people and Moira fires bullets at Erik. He deflects them however, and one of them hits Xavier in the back. Upset about what he had caused, Erik leaves with Mystique, Azazel, Riptide and Angel. Xavier, now wheelchair bound, returns with the mutants back to the mansion, where he opens a school. He talks with Moria and she returns to the CIA and tells them she does not remember any of the events that occurred before. Months later, Magneto returns and breaks Frost out of her confinement cell and asks her to join his Brotherhood, which she accepts.</p><p> </p><h2>Official Synopsis</h2><p><em>X-Men: First Class: “Charts the epic beginning of the X-Men saga, and reveals a secret history of famous global events. Before mutants had revealed themselves to the world, and before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Not archenemies, they were instead at first the closest of friends, working together with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop Armageddon. In the process, a grave rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto’s Brotherhood and Professor X’s X-Men.”</em></p>",
