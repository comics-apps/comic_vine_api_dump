Their journey will take them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Sorcerers.</em></p><p><em>Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain, first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever…Gollum.</em></p><p><em>Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of ingenuity and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum’s “precious” ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities…A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.\"</em></p><h2>Plot</h2><p>This film is the first of three that are an adaptation of J.R.R.

When Bialyia and Pokolistan leaders begin to fuss about their peace treaty being broken, Superman leaves the United Nations to go and stop their armed forces from destroying each other.</p><p>As Superman arrives in Bialyia, he is a bit too late to negotiate peace between the two sides. The Pokolistani forces release their bio weapon on Bialyian military which destroyed most of their ground forces. As Superman gets the soldiers to safety from the bio weapon, <a href=\"/the-elite/4060-41989/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41989\">the Elite</a> arrive just in time to help the man of steel destroy the bio weapon, Superman eventually returns to Metropolis to report the news and also gain more information on the Elite. Superman and Lois fly to England to find if they, and the world, can trust the Elite. It is revealed through Manchester Black that he gained his powers near puberty, and used it for the first time to save his sister, Vera.</p><p>Through telekinesis, Black gets a painful headache of multiple people screaming, The Elite and Superman arrive on the scene to save the civilians. With Superman and Black having lifted up the subway train underwater, Black interrogates the terrorist that were bombing the train. Nearly killing them, Superman begins to judge the motives of his new found friends. Back in Metropolis, Clark and Lois talk about the information they had found on the Elite and also the backstory of Manchester Black. Lois tells Clark that there is no death certificate or birth record of Manchester's sister, Vera, this makes Clark question even more on the origin of the Elite and what they are really trying to accomplish. When Manchester broadcasts a message for all the world to hear, he ends up telling them that they'd take care of all the bad guys in the world; by killing them!</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2400169-atomic_skull_manchester_black.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400169\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1440px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2400169-atomic_skull_manchester_black.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400169\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62058/2400169-atomic_skull_manchester_black.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2400169-atomic_skull_manchester_black.jpg 1440w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/2400169-atomic_skull_manchester_black.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/2400169-atomic_skull_manchester_black.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62058/2400169-atomic_skull_manchester_black.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>After the broadcast, Superman returns to the Fortress of Solitude to find out any reliable information the Elite. Having failed in finding information, Superman travels to Bialyia to stop the Elite. Flying in over Bialyia, Superman is hit by an EMP which leaves him in a bad state of mind, closing in for the kill, Pokolistani forces are about to finish Superman off, however the Elite attack them before that can happen. Powerless to stop the chaos that the Elite are inflicting on the Pokolistani military, Superman ends up passing out and eventually awakening at the Elite's base of operations and teleported back to Earth after he failed to convince the elite they did not have to kill to be heroes. In Metropolis, Atomic Skull had recently broken out of prison and is looking for revenge on Superman. The Elite arrived before Superman so they could end Atomic Skull's criminal career, however were having little success defeating the overpowered Atomic Skull. When Superman arrived on the scene, he coordinated an attack with the Elite to get all the extra power away from Skull.

Angered by Manchester's uncontrollable urge to kill the villains, Superman punches him in the face, and the Elite take it as a statement of war against (what the world says) their favorite heroes. They tell Superman that they will kill him for this outrage. The next day, Superman is standing in the middle of Metropolis, telling the Elite that he is ready to fight. Asking them to do it some where safe, they teleport to the Moon where they begin their fight. Nearly killing, Superman, Superman begins to understand that to protect the world, he must kill The Elite.

    "deck": "The Twilight Zone franchise was begun in 1959 to explore stories in the realm of science fiction, fantasy and horror. The show was hugely influential spawning followup series, Twilight Zone books, comics and movies, and was the inspiration for writers and artists in nearly all forms of media for decades.",
    "description": "<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>Twilight Zone: The Movie is an anthology movie which is comprised of four separate stories, each with a different cast and director.</p><p> </p><h3>Prologue</h3><p> </p><p>The movie begins when a man picks up a hitchhiker (<a href=\"/dan-aykroyd/4040-68377/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68377\">Dan Aykroyd</a>) at night. He attempts to frighten his passenger by turning out the lights and driving in the dark, veering all over the road. The pair then play Guess The Theme Tune, before the hitchhiker asks the driver if he wants to see something really scary. The driver humors him and pulls over, at which point the man turns into a demon, and attacks him.</p><p> </p><h3>Time Out</h3><p> </p><p>The first segment tells the story of a bigoted man who learns a hard lesson.</p><p>Having just been passed over for promotion, the protagonist gets drunk at a local bar with his friends, and proceeds to racially abuse a number of the other drinkers. Angry, the man stumbles out alone into the street - and finds himself in France during the Second World War. There he is mistaken for a Jew, and hunted down by Nazis.</p><p>After being shot by one of them, he finds himself being hunted by the Ku Klux Klan, as they have mistaken him for an African American and want to lynch him. He then finds himself in Vietnam, being pursued by the US forces. After a grenade goes off near to him, he is thrown back to occupied France, where he is loaded into a wagon and driven off - presumably to a death camp. The story ends as he calls out to his friends, seen leaving the bar and searching for him. But they can't hear his cries for help.</p><p> </p><h3>Kick The Can</h3><p> </p><p>The second story focuses on the elderly residents of a retirement home, whose lives are changed when a new person (<a href=\"/scatman-crothers/4040-68379/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68379\">Scatman Crothers</a>) comes to stay. The new resident is an upbeat, optimistic man who encourages the other residents not to resign themselves to old age. To prove his point, he asks the group to come outside and play with him at night and offers them a chance to feel the way they did as children.</p><p>He challenges the other residents to a game of Kick The Can, but something magical happens. As the residents join the game, they are transformed into their younger selves, reverting to their childhood states. They run around, playing and laughing together, before hurrying back to their rooms, not wanting the nursing staff to discover that they are gone.</p><p>Before long, the residents realise that their lives may not necessarily be easier as children. They do not want to be grounded, to do chores, to go to school all over again. They begin to miss their lives as adults, and to realise the value of their journeys and experiences. Except for one man, who decides he is never going back, and wishes to remain a child and start over. While he leaves, the other residents all change back - but find that the experience has given them a new lease of life.</p><p>The story ends as the mysterious new resident leaves, and checks into a new residential home.</p><p> </p><h3>It's A Good Life</h3><p> </p><p>The third story focuses on a young woman who meets a curious little boy while eating at a roadside diner. She sees the boy being picked on by a pair of local boys, and comes to his defence, but the child runs away. The woman leaves then, wanting to get to a job interview, but as she pulls out of the parking lot she hits the child's bicycle and knocks him down. Distressed, she offers to give him a ride home.</p><p>At the boy's home, she meets his family who are strangely sycophantic toward the boy, and seem a little too eager to please him. We soon find out that the boy has strange powers, and can alter reality with his mind. Far from being reverent, his family are afraid of him, and try to fulfill his every want and need so that he will not hurt them.</p><p>The boy eventually reveals that he is frustrated and lonely, that he hates the way others treat him. He makes his house and family disappear, stating that he does not want people around him if it makes them unhappy. The young woman offers to look after him, to teach him how to use his powers for good, and to control his impulses. The two drive away together and as they do, the boy wills beautiful flowers to appear along the side of the road for her.</p><p> </p><h3>Nightmare at 20,000 Feet</h3><p> </p><p>The fourth and final story is about a man (<a href=\"/john-lithgow/4040-68378/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68378\">John Lithgow</a>) with a paralysing phobia of flying. He has a panic attack in the plane's bathroom while flying, and after being reassured and talked into coming out, he returns to his seat and sees a monster through the window, scurrying around on the wing of the plane.</p><p>His fear mounts as he watches the creature, who seems to be causing damage to the aircraft, and he grows more anxious as time passes. He eventually snaps and lashes out, stealing a gun and firing it. He first shoots the window out, then tries to shoot the creature. It takes the gun, destroys it, and then grabs the man's face, chastising him with a wagging finger. As the plane begins to land, the monster leaps off into the night.</p><p>Once landed, the crew hand the man over to emergency staff, who place him in a straitjacket, load him onto a stretcher, and send him away in an ambulance. But further inspection reveals some unexplained and serious damage to the aircraft.</p><p> </p><h3>Epilogue</h3><p> </p><p>In the final scene, as the man from the plane lies in the back of the ambulance, we see that the driver is in fact the hitchhiker from the first segment. He asks the frightened man if he wants to see something really scary, and the film ends with the sound of the airplane passenger's screams.</p>",

When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy’s hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?\"</em></p><h2>Story</h2><p>Back at the 1999/2000 new years celebration, Tony Stark met Maya Hansen at Switzerland. Maya told Tony about the Extremis project. In the present day, Tony Stark never felt the same since the battle of New York. Tony has to encounter a terrorist known as the Mandarin. The Mandarin sent propaganda to the U.S. president. When Tony's house was destroyed by the Mandarin, Jarvis took him to Tennessee where another attack was commited. Tony met a young boy named Harley. The attacks were revealed from kamikaze Extremis wielders. Harley helped Tony track the Mandarin which is revealed as Miami. Inside the Mandarin's house, the Mandarin was actually an actor named Trevor Slattery. The Mandarin was an invention of Aldrich Killian.</p><p> </p><h2>Post-credits scene</h2><p>Tony Stark is talking to Bruce Banner. Bruce Banner wakes up from his sleep. Tony used Bruce as a therapist. Bruce slept since Tony told him about the New Years party.</p>",

Celebrating a better tomorrow, Gordon and Bruce discuss about the way people, and the government, have changed since Bruce retired as Batman and also about old mistakes that Bruce has never forgotten. At the end of the conversation Bruce leaves and travels on foot back home, but is plagued with memories of his past.

In other news reports after the release of Harvey Dent, it shows that he has escaped his Arkham Care center that he was originally living in and is keeping a low profiel. Bruce, while watching the news, is remembered of his past again when The Mark of Zorro appears on television. Eventually Bruce's will is broken by his true identity -- Batman!</p><p>Later on, Batman meets up with Gordon and talks about his next move with capturing Two-face whom is threatening to blow up the Gotham life building if he does not receive 22 million dollars. When Batman arrives on scene to neutralize the first amount of henchmen guarding one of the bombs, one of the henchmen mentioned to Batman that the bombs are only for show and not to kill anyone. As Batman removes the cover he sees that it is set for 2 minutes, he quickly defuses the bomb and he is led to the conclusion that Two-face is trying to end his life. Batman works towards Two-face's helicopter, he saves him as the helicopter explodes with the second bomb inside of it. Through a conversation between one another Batman finds out that Two-face always sees himself with both sides matching and that nothing can change who he was, Batman agreed with this statement in terms with himself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2591826-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_2.00.45_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591826\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56833176248822\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2591826-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_2.00.45_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591826\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/2591826-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_2.00.45_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2591826-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_2.00.45_pm.png 1061w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/2591826-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_2.00.45_pm.png 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/2591826-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_2.00.45_pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Thinking that he was ready for the fight of his life, Batman proceeded to the Mutants base of operations.

Thanks to Batman's efforts, the GCPD had no trouble with capturing half of the Mutant gang. The mayor wanted to solve for peace, but the Mutant Leader instead killed him. Batman, in turn, had a different plan for the Mutants. His plan was to humiliate the Mutant Leader in front of all his loyal followers, thus making the members of the Mutants to lose trust in their gang and surrender.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2591803-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_1.53.44_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591803\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56657223796034\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2591803-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_1.53.44_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591803\"><img alt=\"\"Darling\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/2591803-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_1.53.44_pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2591803-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_1.53.44_pm.png 1059w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/2591803-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_1.53.44_pm.png 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/2591803-screen_shot_2012_09_14_at_1.53.44_pm.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Darling\"</figcaption></figure><p>As Gordon released the Mutant Leader on the orders of Batman, the Mutant Leader saw that all of his followers were in one location.

Then the police arrive, arresting and interrogating all participants. But each of these unusual suspects has his/her own story to tell.</p><p>Red is employed by her grandmother, delivering Granny's delicacies through the forest area. Lately, a mysterious babdit has been stealing recipies from competitive food companies. Forcing small business after small business to close. Red was determined to move her Granny's recipies to a safer location. But she noted being approached by the Wolf, who asked her suspicious questions. Then claims that the Wolf was waiting for her at Granny's house, laying in ambush. She is convinced that he is the bandit.</p><p>The Wolf reveals that he is an investigative reporter. He suspected that Granny and Red were the bandits, seeking to take their competitors off the market. His \"suspicious\" questions were typical journalistic stuff. And his disguise was not part of an ambush. He was going undercover, hoping to squiz Red for information.</p><p>The Woodsman is not a woodsman at all. He is a struggling actor who practiced chopping trees for an upcoming role. One tree rolled after him and nearly crashed him. He simply searched for a way to avoid the danger and jumped through the window of a nearby house. He has no idea who the other people are, claiming that he did't use the axe to threaten them.</p><p>The supposedly sickly Granny reveals that she is an extreme sports enthusiast. She was attacked earlier in the day, but not by the Wolf. Her assailants were her rivals in a ski race, revealed to actually be agents of the bandit.</p><p>Their stories shed some light to their actions. But police and cleared suspects soon realize that each person had contact with the same missing suspect: Boingo the bunny. Whose activities remain unexplained. Making him the prime suspect for the recent crimewave.</p>",

While Jill Tuck, the other surviving assistant, is in protective custody. Hoffman is still determined to test people, before eventually taking his personal revenge. His chosen target is Bobby Daren, a self-help guru who seeks fame and fortune by claiming to be a Jigsaw survivor. The man is a fraud and the tests are not set to kill him, but have him witness the deaths of every person imprortant to him.</p><p>The film ends with Hoffman managing to get to Jill and take her out. But at this point, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (a character from the original film) reveals himself as the unknown third assistant. Flashbacks reveal his behind-the-scenes involvement in the events of all previous films. Jigsaw had left him instructions to kill anybody hurting Jill. Hoffman, who killed her, fits the description and becomes the latest addition to the list of murdered victims.</p>",

    "deck": "Monsters, Inc. is about two monsters, Mike and Sully who scare children for a living. One day a little girl they call Boo escapes into the monster world and changes everything.",
    "description": "<p>In <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56559\" href=\"/monstropolis/4020-56559/\">Monstropolis</a>, electricity is powered by the screams of children. Monsters, Inc. is a scaring company and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10804\" href=\"/sulley/4005-10804/\">James P. \"Sulley\"Sullivan</a> is one of the top scarers and about to break the all time scare record. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10608\" href=\"/mike-wazowski/4005-10608/\">Mike Wazowski</a> is Sulley's teammate, friend, and roomate, and the monster responsible for preparing Sulley's station. However, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9265\" href=\"/randall-boggs/4005-9265/\">Randall Boggs</a> is close to Sulley's record as well. Sulley breaks the record, but later finds a door to the human world in Randall's station. A 2-year-old girl escapes into the monster world and takes a liking to Sulley. However, human children are believed to be toxic so Sulley has to take every precaution not to be caught with her by the Children Detection Agency (CDA). The two sneak the girl who Sulley dubs \"<a data-ref-id=\"4005-66589\" href=\"/boo/4005-66589/\">Boo</a>\" home with them and have to keep her secreted away until they can return her to her world tomorrow.</p><p>While they try to return Boo, Randall kidnaps Mike (thinking he was Boo), and reveals new technology: a scream extractor, used to suck the screams out of hard to scare children. Sulley rescues Mike and they take Boo to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-66643\" href=\"/henry-j-waternoose-iii/4005-66643/\">Henry J. Waternoose III</a>, the chairman of Monsters, Inc. to help return the little girl to her home. However, Waternoose instead banishes the two to the Himalayas where they meet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21081\" href=\"/yeti/4005-21081/\">The Abominable Snowman</a> (voiced by John Ratzenberger), a monster that had been banished years ago. Mike and Sulley fight because all Sulley cares about is Boo, but Sulley heads to the nearby village and use another door to return to the monster world. Mike comes with to apologize and they save Boo from the scream extractor.</p><p>Randall pursues the trio to the storage room for all the doors used by Monsters, Inc. which they activate by making Boo laugh. The three run through the human world with Randall hot on their heels until they trick him into a door, then destroy it, trapping him in the human world. Sulley finds Boo's door, but it's moved out of storage by Waternoose who is planning on using the scream extractor on as many kidnapped children as needed to protect the company. Mike catches Waternoose's speech on camera and the CDA arrest him. Boo is returned home, but the CDA insist that her door must be destroyed so she can never return the monster world.</p><p>Sullivan becomes the new chairman of Monsters, Inc. and begins a new are for the company. Children's laughs are more powerful than screams so the monsters now go into children's rooms as comedians. Mike then reveals to Sully that he reassembled Boo's door, and Sulley opens the door to reunite with Boo.</p><h3>Additional Media</h3><p>Mike and Sully reappeared in the 2002 short, Mike's New Car.</p><p>A prequel to Monsters, Inc. entitled Monster University is scheduled to be released June 21, 2013.</p>",

    "description": "<p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-76701\" href=\"/bolt/4005-76701/\">Bolt</a> begins as a TV star, but is never aware of it. He is a super-powered dog who pursued the green-eyed man, the evil Dr. Calico, along with all the evil cats, to protect Penny his person. However the producer never let Bolt know it was a TV show in order to keep him in character; he is the ultimate method actor. However, when shooting a two-part episode with a cliffhanger, Bolt thinks Penny is still in danger so he escapes from his trailer to find her and accidentally gets shipped to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\" href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\">New York City</a>. He is horrified to discover that his powers are gone and blames the styrofoam he was shipped in.</p><p>There he meets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76803\" href=\"/mittens/4005-76803/\">Mittens</a>, an alley cat that offers the pigeons \"protection\" from her claws if they bring her food. She thinks Bolt is crazy, but agrees to help him find his way back to Penny when he threatens to drop her off a bridge. The two begin moving across country and in the midwest they meet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76804\" href=\"/rhino/4005-76804/\">Rhino</a>, the hamster. Rhino is a Bolt fanboy and only encourages Bolt's delusions.</p><p>The three continue across the country, but both Bolt and Mittens are taken to the pound, and Bolt is unable to use his powers to save them. He then begins to realize that he's not a superhero and Mittens teaches him how to be a real dog. They finally reach <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55734\" href=\"/las-vegas/4020-55734/\">Las Vegas</a> where Mittens wants to stay, but Bolt wants to go on to find Penny. Mittens says Penny is just as much of a lie as anything else, in part because she was left behind by her family.</p><p>Bolt continues on, only to find that the show has replaced him and sees Penny embracing the new Bolt and he leaves. Mittens makes it to the studio in time to see that Penny still misses the real Bolt. Mittens convinces Bolt to return just as there is a fire in the studio. The new Bolt runs away, but Penny is trapped. Bolt charges in to save Penny, and they make it to a ventilation duct, but Penny collapses. Bolt decides to stay with her, but hears noise from the outside and barks. The firefighters outside hear him and are able to rescue them both.</p><p>Penny and Bolt both retire from the show and live in the country with Penny's mom, Mittens, and Rhino where they live an average life as a girl and her dog.</p>",

    "description": "<p>James Bond is missing and presumed to be dead after a mission in Istanbul, and the identities of every active undercover MI6 agent are leaked onto the internet. M is now being reviewed over her handling of the situation. Bond reappears when the service is under attack. M decides she needs to seek out Raoul Silva (a dangerous villain who claims a personal connection to both of them). Bond soon finds his loyalty to M challenged over secrets from her past whilst he follows her trail from London to South China.</p><p>Production of Skyfall was suspended in 2010 due to the financial troubles of MGM. They resumed pre-production following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010. The film's release will coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Bond film series, which began with <a data-ref-id=\"4025-490\" href=\"/dr-no/4025-490/\">Dr. No</a> in 1962. It will also be the first Bond film released in IMAX theatres.</p>",

It was an incredible experience with everyone on the project throwing in their time just for the fun of it. It's been a blast to be a part of from start to finish; we hope the friends of Frank enjoy watching it as much as we did making it.\"</em></p></blockquote><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>\"Kick-Ass, Hit Girl and Red Mist return for the follow-up to 2010’s irreverent global hit: ‘Kick-Ass 2.’ After Kick-Ass’ (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) insane bravery inspires a new wave of self-made masked crusaders, led by the badass Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey), our hero joins them on patrol. When these amateur superheroes are hunted down by Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse)—reborn as The Mother F%&amp;*^r—only the blade-wielding Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) can prevent their annihilation. When we last saw junior assassin Hit Girl and young vigilante Kick-Ass, they were trying to live as normal teenagers Mindy and Dave. With graduation looming and uncertain what to do, Dave decides to start the world’s first superhero team with Mindy.</em></p><p><em>Unfortunately, when Mindy is busted for sneaking out as Hit Girl, she’s forced to retire—leaving her to navigate the terrifying world of high-school mean girls on her own. With no one left to turn to, Dave joins forces with Justice Forever, run by a born-again ex-mobster named Colonel Stars and Stripes. Just as they start to make a real difference on the streets, the world’s first super villain, The Mother F%&amp;*^r, assembles his own evil league and puts a plan in motion to make Kick-Ass and Hit Girl pay for what they did to his dad. But there’s only one problem with his scheme: If you mess with one member of Justice Forever, you mess with them all.\"</em></p><p> </p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Kick-Ass 2 is the sequel to 2010's Kick-Ass, based upon the comics of the same name by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. After the events of the original film, the number of real life superheroes has been on the rise. Meanwhile, Red Mist seeks revenge against Kick-Ass for the death of his father and decides to change his name to the Motherfucker, declaring himself as the world's first supervillain.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>\"Marvel Studios presents Avengers: Age of Ultron, the epic follow-up to the biggest Super Hero movie of all time. When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, are put to the ultimate test as the fate of the planet hangs in the balance. As the villainous Ultron emerges, it is up to The Avengers to stop him from enacting his terrible plans, and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way for an epic and unique global adventure.</em></p><p><em>Marvel’s Avengers: Age of Ultron stars Robert Downey Jr., who returns as Iron Man, along with Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. Together with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, and with the additional support of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, the team must reassemble to defeat James Spader as Ultron, a terrifying technological villain hell – bent on human extinction. Along the way, they confront two mysterious and powerful newcomers, Wanda Maximoff, played by Elizabeth Olsen, and Pietro Maximoff, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and meet an old friend in a new form when Paul Bettany becomes Vision.\"</em></p><p><br /></p>",

At the White House, the President talks to Superman about convincing Batman to retire before he has to use force. At a police event, James Gordon is giving a speech that begins Ellen <span>Yindel's</span> start as Gotham City's new commissioner. At the end of the speech, Ellen <span>Yindel</span> gives a call for the Batman's arrest. The next day, Clark tries to convince Bruce to return to retirement, however Bruce refuses even though Clark warned him that the President would eventually send him to end Bruce. The conversation ends when the President calls Superman to fight against the Soviet Union.</p><p>Later, at the David <span>Endochrine</span> Show, Joker is going on stage to tell \"his side of the story\".

Batman retreats with Robin to find out later that Joker has escaped. Joker eventually meets with Selina Kyle at her brothel to try to draw out Batman.

    "description": "<p><em>\"Disney•Pixar proudly presents the hilarious story of how two mismatched monsters met and became lifelong friends in a movie screaming with laughter and oozing with heart. Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) was a little monster, he dreamed of becoming a Scarer – and he knows better than anyone that the best Scarers come from Monsters University (MU). But during his first semester at MU, Mike’s plans are derailed when he crosses paths with hotshot, James P. Sullivan, “Sulley” (John Goodman), a natural-born Scarer. The pair’s out of control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University’s elite Scare Program. With their dreams temporarily dashed, they realize they will have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope to make things right. Pull an all-nighter with hours of exclusive bonus extras, including an inside look at the world of monsters and the animated theatrical short film The Blue Umbrella. Monsters University opens the door to huge laughs.\"</em></p>",

Overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years - and it's meant billions for OmniCorp's bottom line. Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it. When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) - a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit - is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice.</em></p>",
