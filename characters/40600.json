When they meet, Nobody is been shot and asks Turtles to help him by following a truck. The Turtles are suspicious about nobody, but agree to help him after seeing his badge (he is a cop). Nobody is investigating peculiar activities of a new salvage company. It turns out that the new salvage company is selling left over arms of a company called Rufington Arms. Ruffington Arms is a gun manufacturer, who manufactures guns for the government. With the help of Turtles, Nobody is able to stop arm dealing and arrest bad guys.</p><h3>Casey Jones: Killer</h3><p>When <a href=\"/casey-jones/4005-44890/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44890\">Casey Jones</a> accidentally kills a teenager, Nobody is there to guide Casey back from the brink of violence and alcohol he had pushed himself to.</p><h3>Death</h3><p>The turtles travel to the desert after <a href=\"/raphael/4005-37764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37764\">Raphael</a> had been kidnapped, and, along with <a href=\"/mr-braunze/4005-71743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71743\">Mr. Braunze</a>, Nobody follows. He seemingly sacrifices himself and is apparently killed when trying to fight off a giant, tentacled monster.</p><h3>April O'Neil</h3><p>After <a href=\"/april-oneil/4005-44968/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44968\">April</a> goes through her nanobot ordeal, she undergoes a personal journey that eventually leads her to don an all black costume and garner the title of \"Nobody.\" After hearing rumors of signifying Nobody's return, Casey Jones investigates only to find the aloof April.</p><h3>Resurrection</h3><p>Nobody is apparently resurrected a decent amount of time later. However, this does not seem to be the same nobody as the one before. It is explained that he was healed but, with an entity given to him, is now a supernatural crime fighter. In this incarnation, he wears a glowing white costume instead of black.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Klim was created in Alphatron Criminal Clinic, which serves as a prison for handicapped villains. Four criminal geniuses decided to create something that will allow them to commit crimes again, although remotely. They stole various details from clinical equipment and secretly constructed ideal criminal. Klim soon became infamous intergalactic thief able to commit any crime. But one day Klim, after robbing a treasury clipper, ran into a team of Legionnaires that consisted of <a href=\"/chemical-king/4005-21509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21509\"> Chemical King</a>, <a href=\"/cosmic-boy/4005-1264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1264\"> Cosmic Boy</a> and <a href=\"/shrinking-violet/4005-12835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12835\"> Shrinking Violet</a>. They started a pursue and chased him to Nara, the jungle planet. He tried to hide among the plants, but they were hostile and attempted to seize him. He easily went out of this situation by exposing the alien plant to 50000 degrees of thermal heat which turned it to the ash, but did no harm to Klim thanks to mysterious Insulation Metal which his body is made of. When Klim freed himself of the plant's bonds, he was immediately attacked by Cosmic Boy who pinned Klim to the nearest cliff. Then Chemical King chilled the nitrogen in the air around Klim's body until it became the liquid nitrogen when froze his precious body. Next, Shrinking Violet reduced her size and loosened the connecting bolts on Klim's head, thus detaching it from the body. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to stop him as his head was able to escape. At the last moment, he took a glance of the \"Legionnaire\" who defeated him to take revenge on him in the future, but his electronic vision was malfunctioning (as result of losing the body), so, he saw a \"composite\" Legionnaire, which was caused by overlapping images of Chemical King and Cosmic Boy. He successfully fled from the battlefield and directed to the asteroid Voran-4 (where Alphatron Criminal Clinic is situated). Previously Klim providently dug the deep tunnel on the surface of the asteroid and placed the secret concealment cube in it, so, after his miserable defeat he reached the tunnel and placed himself into the cube. Months after, when Klim had enough power, he started to send impulses to his body, which was placed at the Security Station ZJ. After receiving the signals the body instantly started its way to the source of the impulses - Voran-4. Chemical King, Cosmic Boy and Shrinking Violet overheard about this case and decided to chase the body straight to its destination. In the tunnel, they encountered various traps, but they didn't stopped the trio. At last, they faced their foe who was still without his body (it was buried under the rocks) and revealed horrifying truth to him. Although Klim seemed to be helpless, he claimed that they will be vaporized by his stun-vision which will be intensified by the cube's unique prisma-glass. But in this moment his voice started to sound higher which caused cube to shatter. It was explained by sabotage actions of Shrinking Violet who after reduction in size altered his voice-circuits. Klim was taken by Legionnaires as prisoner and has not been seen since.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2>Enki Sunrise's father was a cop who was killed by another cop for standing up to corruption. She carried on his tradition, becoming a police detective. When Internal Affairs called on her to secretly investigate the disappearance of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2996\" href=\"/deena-pilgrim/4005-2996/\" slug=\"deena-pilgrim\">Deena Pilgrim</a> and find proof that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2997\" href=\"/christian-walker/4005-2997/\" slug=\"christian-walker\">Detective Christian Walker</a> was in possession of powers, she readily accepted the assignment due to what happened with her father leaving her particular interest in cops who were not on the straight and narrow. She then replaced the missing Pilgrim as Walker's new partner. <br/><h2>Creation </h2>Enki Sunrise was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40435\" href=\"/brian-michael-bendis/4040-40435/\" slug=\"brian-michael-bendis\">Brian Michael Bendis</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-2994\" href=\"/michael-avon-oeming/4040-2994/\" slug=\"michael-avon-oeming\">Michael Avon Oeming</a>. She was introduced in the final story arc of the second volume of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-18034\" href=\"/powers/4050-18034/\" slug=\"powers\"><i>Powers</i></a>, setting up her role as one of the main protagonist in the third volume of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-30045\" href=\"/powers/4050-30045/\" slug=\"powers\"><i>Powers</i></a>. <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><h3>The 25 Coolest Dead Super-Heroes of All Time </h3>Detective Enki Sunrise became Christian Walker's new partner while he and the department were neck deep in the case of the missing Deena Pilgrim and a powers-related virus that resulting in the deaths of dozens of teenage girls. In the midst of all this, Sunrise still had her own secret agenda from Internal Affairs, which was to determine whether Walker was aiding Pilgrim and if he still had powers. <br/> <br/>The crisis with the powers virus quickly escalated so severely that Sunrise's Internal Affair investigation was no longer a priority and Ana Stone, the Internal Affairs officer who put her up to it, was kicked off the case. This freed Sunrise to help tackle the situation with freed hands, and it was successfully resolved with Pilgrim's help, though this did not earn Pilgrim respect from Sunrise. Pilgrim was still a cop who went rogue. In the aftermath, Pilgrim left the police force and Sunrise became Walker's partner permanently. <br/> <br/>However, Sunrise's investigation into whether Walker still had powers continued at the secret behest of someone else in Internal Affairs.",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Butcheress is a Nazi scientist, who works on Daemites (parasite creatures form the first game). She develops a fascination towards them and feed prisoners and her own solders to them. This made them love the Butcheress. When <a href=\"/bloodrayne/4005-46793/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46793\"> BloodRayne</a> attacked her, she showed off amazing fighting skills and was believed to have been killed when she was thrown into the Daemites pit. Actually they protected her and she survived the experience.</p><p> </p><h2>Return</h2><p>Many years after the battle, BloodRayne discovered that the Butcheress was still alive. She revealed to Rayne that she had kidnapped her when she was young and tested the parasite on her. This failed and she lost the memory of the event until the Parasite Queen was killed. She then stabs Rayne with a surgical saw and troughs her out the window. After that she started to take a blood bath, when Rayne and her sister <a href=\"/ferril/4005-68983/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68983\"> Ferril</a>, who had been captured, blew the complex up. Knowing her track record, Rayne thinks she may have survived the explosion.</p><p> </p><h2>Human Vampirism</h2><p>The Butcheress takes pride in being a descendant of <a href=\"/elizabeth-bathory/4005-54927/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54927\"> Elizabeth Báthory</a>. She uses stiletto heals and bow saws as weapons. She gets her powers thanks to bathing in virgin girls' blood. That also keeps her young and beautiful.

    "description": "<br/>MjNari was the elder, and leader of the Shani tribe in South Africa. He was very old, though his age was never mentioned, he was referred to as the old one by even the elderly of the tribe. He briefly befriended Storm after she lost her powers, and was wandering through south Africa in Search of herself. When a new child was born stillborn, Storm revived him, and due to strict Shani tradition, an elder of the tribe was to sacrifice himself, and MjNari did so without opposition. Storm tried desperately to talk him out of it, but he explained to her that their tribe had as many as the land they lived on could support, and that the very old had to make way for the very new, so any time a child was born an elder must die. When he died he named Storm as his successor, and she was also named as the godmother to the new born baby boy, who she named MjNari in the elders Honor. <br/> <br/>His words Storm still linger with storm. <br/> <br/>\"And yet though he is gone, I still hear his voice. -'Somewhere on these plains it is said, countless ages ago, the human race began. Now two great cultures crash headlong into each other. The very old against the very new. The one must give way for the other for that is natures way. But at the same time it's wisdom and experience must teach lest youth and immaturity bring about unwitting catastrophe. Technology is not inherently bad, merely the careless and stupid use of it. Neither tradition is wholly good, if it blinds us to ways of making our lives better and happier. A bridge needed between these two halves, a synthesis, a blend, a person who is both one and the other, who’s mind comprehends and who’s hands command the machines, yet who's eyes and soul look upon them with the wisdom of the ages.\"    ",

He kisses her on her hands. Morover, he is shown to be a great fan of the female singer, <strong>Bianca Castafiore</strong>. <br /> <br />In spite of his calm appearance he can get very angry, but he usually expresses few feelings, and is modest and reserved. The funny part is he often fails to interpret Captain Haddock's abuses but when he does hear them he gets pretty worked up. Like when he was called a <em>goat</em> by the Captain in Destination Moon. Calculus becomes mostly victim of the circumstances.  <br /> <br />He was kidnapped by the goons of <strong>Syldavia</strong> for his scientific prowess which led to a series of adventures.  <br /> <br />Both his appearance and his manner are an anachronism, and there is a subtle contrast between his behaviour, which is that of at least a century earlier, and his highly advanced inventions. For a while, Calculus himself does not change, but his scientific career progresses by leaps and bounds.  From being a small time inventor who invented the little submarine used in Red Rackham's Treasure he becomes a nuclear scientist in his <strong>Syldavian </strong>adventures.  He invents a nuclear powered rocket in the book<strong> Destination Moon</strong>. Later, he is one among the first persons to set foot on the Moon. <br /> <br />The last funny thing that the Professor does is to invent a drug that will terminate a drunkard's addiction to drinks if applied on him only once. His first victim is Captain Haddock. This happens in <strong>Tintin and the Picaros</strong></p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Malcolm Dragon is the only child of the heroes <a href=\"/savage-dragon/4005-5209/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5209\">Savage Dragon</a> and <a href=\"/rapture/4005-17829/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17829\">Rapture</a>. He was born extremely premature but due to his unique genetic heritage, he was born as developed and healthy as many full-term babies. This early great news quickly turned sour when Malcolm died in Hillman Hospital. It was decided by his parents not to insist on an autopsy as it seemed clear that Malcolm died due to complications with his premature birth and he was laid to rest in a local cemetery. However, unbeknownst to both Kurr and Sharona, Malcolm was still alive and well. The secretive Covenant of the Sword organization had abducted the child and left a synthetic double in his place. This covert group had been set-up in the past by the time-travelling Damien DarkLord and were dedicating to building up a private army of superhumans, raising the offspring of known super-powered freaks in the doctrine of the Covenant of the Sword.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Malcolm was created by <a href=\"../../erik-larsen/26-4801/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Erik Larsen.</a></p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1043816-malcolm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043816\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 535px\" data-ratio=\"0.98691588785047\" data-width=\"535\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1043816-malcolm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043816\"><img alt=\"Malcolm Dragon\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1043816-malcolm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1043816-malcolm.jpg 535w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1043816-malcolm.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1043816-malcolm.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Malcolm Dragon</figcaption></figure><p>Malcolm remained in the care of the Covenant, being raised by an alternate version of his mother, brought over by DarkLord to replace Rapture (whom he had previously killed).

This continued for another couple of years until Universo, the Devourer of Worlds, arrived to consume the Earth. Malcolm and several other children managed to avoid the end of the world when SoulStar, HotWire and SkyLark took them with them through a portal into Dimension-X. This led to a long exile where these survivors fought constantly against alien threats until the adults got caught up in a battle against monsters. The children fled and eventually learned of the existence of Glum World where a portal back home was rumored to exist. Malcolm led his friends to the planet where Mister Glum reluctantly returned them all home, at the behest of the alternate Earth’s Angel Dragon.</p><p><b>A Family of Dragons</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1084053\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1360px\" data-ratio=\"1.5477941176471\" data-width=\"1360\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1084053\"><img alt=\"Malcolm &amp; Angel vs. Mako\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg 1360w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg 413w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Malcolm &amp; Angel vs. Mako\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg 1360w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1084053-mako2.jpg 413w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Malcolm &amp; Angel vs. Mako</figcaption></figure><p>Malcolm was finally reunited with his father and step-sister, allowing them to be a family for the very first time.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Legato was originally a sex slave, and was used by a town of over 1300 people. He developed his technique to control others during the time he was held captive. He could have used it to kill all of them but he didn't as he saw no purpose behind it. One of the people found out about his abilities and decided to punish him. Unfortunately for that fellow and the entire town, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/millions-knives/4005-58338/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58338\">Knives</a> came along and killed them all, chopping them into pieces in an instant. Legato then joins him in his quest to destroy the human race.</p><p>During the July incident, when Knives is found lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood, Legato begins to cry. The doctor that was with him tries to reason with him, but he couldn't be reached, until Knives gets things straightened out.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>First confrontation</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1262288\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262288-2.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.0901883052527\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:109.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262288-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1262288\"><img alt=\"Harmlessly passing by Vash.\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262288-2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262288-2.jpg 1009w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54482/1262288-2.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54482/1262288-2.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262288-2.jpg 587w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" data-width=\"587\"></a><figcaption>Harmlessly passing by Vash.</figcaption></figure><p>The first meeting between <a href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\">Vash the Stampede </a>and Legato was in a small town, Vash was standing on a bench after receiving a football in the face. In order to repay the kids that gave him a shot to the face, Vash treated them all to ice cream. Unfortunately a girl nearby that Vash wanted to treat refused him, but took a hot dog that Legato gave her without hesitation. After a telepathic discussion the two had about Millions Knives, Vashs' brother and about the <a href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\">Gung Ho Guns</a>, Legato left but not without giving Vash a little gift: the head of a shoemaker that Vash had visited earlier that day. Later that day he met with <a href=\"/monev-the-gale/4005-67724/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67724\">Monev the Gale</a> to ensure that he would be ready to face Vash soon.</p><h3>The Meaning of Life is Death</h3><p>After witnessing <a href=\"/eg-mine/4005-67726/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67726\">E.G. Mine's </a>defeat at the hands of Vash and getting a few threats from him, as to Legato being the one who was going to hunted down from now on, Legato left the town. Soon he would have what seemed to be a lunch in a small bar, but his lunch would be interrupted by a small gang, led by the Roderick the Slaver. Legato unwillingly caught the attention of their girls, girls that were taken from their families. One of the gang members tried to scare off Legato with a few shots. Not very impressed but a little angered by his attitude, Legato showed him what true power was all about. This was the first time Legato used his powers in the manga. He controlled the attacker's left hand, using it to have him pull out his heart. After seeing this, the rest of the gang tried in vain to kill Legato, but ended up being forced to kill each other. He left then after he gave a little speech on the meanings of life to the gang's female slaves.</p><h3>Reuniting the Gung Ho Guns</h3><p>After killing the leader of the Roderick gang, Legato seemed to be pursued by the band of outlaws, but unfortunately for them, the Gung Ho Guns were throwing a party and they were going to use the bodies of the band to prove to them their awesome powers. Legato ordered the Gung Ho Guns to kill only half of the band. About 50 people were taken down by what seemed to be 7 members of the team, the other half had the job of making \"good use\" of the dead bodies, as Legato called it. In the mean time <a href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\">Nicholas D. Wolfwood </a>was meeting Vash.</p><h3>Knives reborn</h3><p>After <a href=\"/dominique-the-cyclops/4005-67725/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67725\">Dominique's </a>failure with Vash, Legato and the members of the Gung Ho Guns that killed Roderick's gang met up with the doctor that was treating Knives. Chapel (Nicholas D Wolfwood) also decided to join the party. He was a little late but he wasn't late for the party that was held in a church. The \"resurrection\" of Knives was a very painful one, as Vash who was unconscious at the time, woke up and started screaming of Knives' return. Awakened and wounded after his previous battle, he rushed to the church on the mountain, only to find a crippled Legato at the hands of Knives. The reason was a simple one: Legato was supposed to make Vash suffer, and not try to kill him, and so he had tried to use the Gung Ho Guns for his own purposes. A few minutes later Knives made his move on Vash, using his superior speed, in mere seconds Knives left Legato, grabbed Vash, and nearly wound up destroying them all using Vash's angel arm. Luckily Vash manged to move his arm, the ray of energy instead hitting the moon in the sky above them, leaving a huge crater in it.</p><h3>The Gathering</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1262322\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262322-21.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.4913112164297\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262322-21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1262322\"><img alt=\"A crippled Legato &amp; his attendant.\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262322-21.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262322-21.jpg 633w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262322-21.jpg 429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px\" data-width=\"429\"></a><figcaption>A crippled Legato &amp; his attendant.</figcaption></figure><p>Two years later after he was crippled by Knives as punishment, Legato is seen with one of <a href=\"/leonof-the-puppet-master/4005-67728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67728\">Leonof</a>'s puppets who was giving him the news of Vash resurfacing. Legato made an appearance along with a few other Gung Ho Guns members, when they used their powers to crush a sheriff task force. After Legato used his powers to get them in line, he made them go in a container, forcing the men to crush their own bodies together in it. He then received some more information on Vash's whereabouts.</p><p>After this Legato decided to have a bite to eat, as he began eating, he invited the other Gung Ho Guns to step forward: <a href=\"/gray-the-ninelives/4005-67729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67729\">Gray the Ninelives</a>, <a href=\"/midvalley-the-hornfreak/4005-67733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67733\">Midvalley the Hornfreak</a>, <a href=\"/hoppered-the-gauntlet/4005-67730/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67730\">Hoppered the Gauntlet</a>, <a href=\"/zazie-the-beast/4005-67732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67732\">Zazie the Beast</a>, <a href=\"/rai-dei-the-blade/4005-67727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67727\">Rai-Dei the Blade, </a>and Leonof the Puppet-Master. During the time he was eating, Midvalley decided to lecture Legato on how they, the Gung Ho Guns should be stopping people like Vash and Knives, instead of helping them. So Midvalley decided to point a gun at Legato, a very big mistake, as Legato used his powers and nearly broke Midvalley in half. He then explained to the Gung Ho Guns their new objective: they were no longer to kill Vash, but to make him suffer instead, to show him the true nature of humanity. He also noticed the betrayal of Wolfwood, when he later fought against Gray the Ninelives.</p><h3>Bottom of the Dark</h3><p>Legato is seen later after the two battles between Vash and Wolfwood against Midvalley and Hoppered had ended. He steps in to find Midvalley and Wolfwood as they were trying to kill each other. When Midvalley sees Legato, he tries to kill him, but fails due to the fact that Legato forces Hoppered to shoot Midvalley, killing him almost instantly. He then uses the massive motorbike his new body was driving, and crushes Midvalley's bodu underneath it, killing him. He then tries to to attack a transforming Vash, but Wolfwood and Hoppered try to stop him. Then Zazie steps in, using a new body, this time the body of a young girl. Legato is then shot by <a href=\"/meryl-stryfe/4005-74329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74329\">Meryl</a> and Hoppered, while Hoppered and Wolfwood are shot by Zazie. A scared Legato then tries to finish Hoppered off, by using the dead body of Midvalley to shoot him. Legato goes berserk and tries to kill everyone but <a href=\"/elendira-the-crimsonnail/4005-67736/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67736\">Elendira the Crimsonnail </a>steps in and uses his spikes to stop Legato, and then drags him back to Knives.</p><h3>Cross X</h3><p>The Gung Ho Guns were nearly wiped out after their last confrontation with Vash and Wolfwood, so Legato had a little chat with Elendira about the future of the Gung Ho Guns. Legato told Elendira that he had invited two members of the Eye of Michael organization to be part of the Gung Ho Guns, their names being <a href=\"/livio-the-double-fang/4005-67737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67737\">Livio the Double Fang </a>and <a href=\"/chapel-the-evergreen/4005-67734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67734\">Chapel the Evergreen</a>. The two new member came eventually, but they didn't come empty-handed, as Livio brought the bodies of two intruders that had been trying to get in. Moments later he, Livio, Chapel, and Elendira witnessed Knives's ability to absorb other plants like himself.</p><p>Legato is later seen trying to talk Elendira into stopping the battle between Knives and Vash, but Elendira doesn't listen, so he goes into the middle of the battle and stops Knives from absorbing Vash, saving his life in the process. Knives then gives the order that Legato is to keep an eye on Vash. Legato left with Knives, Vash and Elendira on the original SEEDS ship that settled their planet. He and Knives tortured Vash along the way, reminding him why he should hate humans. Legato was very cautious around Vash.</p><p>Legato is soon attacked by Wolfwood in an attempt to save Vash. It seems that Legato had been using his powers the past half a year to bring down Vash, whose powers were now at their weakest. Legato gets shot in the back though by Wolfwood before he can finish, but he still manages to make Wolfwood shoot himself.</p><h3>Zero Hour</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1262393\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1196319018405\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1262393\"><img alt=\"Legato uses his powers on himself to keep  fighting, after having destroyed Zazie's second body.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg 652w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg 571w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Legato uses his powers on himself to keep  fighting, after having destroyed Zazie's second body.\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg 652w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262393-54.jpg 571w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Legato uses his powers on himself to keep  fighting, after having destroyed Zazie's second body.</figcaption></figure><p>Legato was on his deathbed after getting shot again. When Zazie tries to take Knives' body though, Legato stops him, and attempts to kill Zazie's body with a gunshot, but he fails, and so forces Zazie to drive her own arm through her body. Zazie's body is later fully destroyed by Knives. Legato manages to save himself from his deathbed by using the metallic threads he normally uses to control other people's bodies, thereby also allowing him to overcome his body's crippled condition. During the battle between Knives and Vash, Legato jumps in and confronts Vash. Legato defeats Vash, but only momentarily. As Vash gets back up, seeing himself in Vash's actions, Legato takes the coin box he'd given him, and tells him that it is a miniature magnetic field generator, activated by the coins taken from defeated Gung Ho Gun members, and that it was going to be used to disable Legato's powers.</p><h3>Double Duel</h3><p>Even without his powers, Legato was still a formidable opponent for Vash. He had incredible speed, and was now using the body of the woman that had carried him around while he was crippled as a wrecking-ball, one that had machine guns on the side. He tries to defeat Vash with it , but he can't and as soon as the wrecking-ball is destroyed, Legato draws a different gun, as the duel had just begun. Knowing that he would be defeated just like Elendira, Legato activates his powers once more, on himself, in order to attack one last time. Legato tells Vash that he was already 8 months under the influence of his powers, and that nothing can escape it. Legato fails however, and knowing that he couldn't control Vash he gives up, and orders Vash to kill him for his failure. Vash refuses but Legato threatens to kill Vash's new ally Livio, who's head he was about to rip off using the body of the dead Elendira, and threatens to do the same to everyone else Vash cared about. Vash is left no other choice, and willingly kills Legato.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1262348\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.94575045207957\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1262348\"><img alt=\"The weapon made of the woman who carried him while crippled.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg 553w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The weapon made of the woman who carried him while crippled.\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg 553w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1262348-21.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The weapon made of the woman who carried him while crippled.</figcaption></figure><p>The powers of manga Legato are very different from his anime counterpart. He uses a special technique he developed while he was caged, which uses thousands of special metallic threads located in his medulla oblongata, that are released out of a skull-shaped emblem attached to his left arm, when they are released, they attack the muscles of the victim, sending electricity through them that enables Legato to control their body. These threads are a only a few molecules thick, and he can take control an entire city with them; he even used them on himself, allowing him to move his body once more after he was crippled by Knives.</p><p>Legato also had a gun with a knife on top and in his final battle with Vash he used the body of the woman that was transporting him while he was crippled as a weapon. Locked within a sort of Iron Maiden, she had spikes, machine guns and even a laser cannon as part of her arsenal.</p><p> </p><h2>Anime version</h2><p>The Legato in the anime is quite different from his manga version. He is never crippled by Knives, and he is given Vash's left arm which gives him telepathic abilities - while his manga version uses special threads to control people's muscles with the electricity transmitted through them. He is ultimately killed by Vash, when he threatens to kill Milly and Meryl. He is the only person that the anime version of Vash ever killed.</p>",

Monev's first confrontation with Vash happened shortly after Vash was incarcerated after being suspected of killing a shoemaker, who had actually been killed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">        Legato Bluesummers</a>.      <br/><h2>Creation</h2> Monev the Gale was created by <a href=\"../../yasuhiro-nightow/26-60661/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yasuhiro Nightow</a> for his <a href=\"../../trigun/49-29518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trigun</a> series.<br/><h2>Major Story Arcs<br/> </h2><h3>Diablo</h3>Monev payed Vash a little visit to the cell he was in. After killing the deputy and destroying the walls of the cell, Monev managed to grab onto Vash, although not for long, as Vash managed to catch Monev by surprise with a hidden gun that was built into his left arm. With this, Vash was able to disable one of the two guns mounted on Monev's arms, as well as wounding him in his right shoulder.  <br/><h3>Fragile</h3>After this Monev used his remaining gun to destroy a large portion of the city, killing a lot of innocent bystanders and shooting off Vash's left arm. Vash managed to shoot Monev in his faceplate however, giving him just enough time to get to the city bank and use the vault as a defense against Monev.  <br/>Realizing Vash's plan, Monev revealed a big rucksack full of firearms and took out a giant minigun that was powerful enough to punch through the bank vault. Monev attempted to kill Vash in a relentless barrage of bullets, but Vash was able to use the vault door as a shield long enough to fire two perfectly placed shots to Monev's head, knocking off his protective faceplate and then aiming at his exposed face at point-blank range. Monev begged Vash not to kill him, and realizing that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74524\" href=\"/rem-saverem/4005-74524/\" slug=\"rem-saverem\">  Rem</a> wouldn't want him to kill him either, Vash let Monev live.   <br/><h3>Scars</h3>After his defeat, Monev warned Vash of the other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\"> Gung Ho Guns</a> and gave him his coin of the 12 Gung Ho Guns.<br/>Not much later after leaving town, Vash finds Monev's body nailed to a cross with his left leg ripped off, apparently having been killed by fellow Gung Ho Gun <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67726\" href=\"/eg-mine/4005-67726/\" slug=\"eg-mine\">               E.G. Mine</a> for his failure.<br/><h2>Powers and Equipment</h2>Monev wears a powerful battle suit and caries two high-powered gatling-guns on his arms; he also has a pressure chamber on the back of his that increases the firing  speed of the two guns on his arms. These guns are shown to have  incredible stopping power, powerful enough to tear through entire  buildings.  <br/>He also has a bag full of machine guns and other assorted weapons, most notably a giant minigun that he used to destroy a back vault Vash was hiding behind at the time. <br/><h2>Anime Version  </h2>The anime version of Monev is almost identical to how he was presented in the manga, although both he and <a href=\"../../dominique-the-cyclops/29-67725/\" rel=\"nofollow\">              Dominique the Cyclops</a> were killed by E.G.

    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>Dominique the Cyclops was created by <a href=\"../../yasuhiro-nightow/26-60661/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yasuhiro Nightow</a> for his <a href=\"../../trigun/49-29518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trigun</a> series.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Invisible Eye</h3><p>After she and a few other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\">Gung Ho Guns</a> members crushed a slaver's gang, Dominique drew out <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\" href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" slug=\"vash-the-stampede\">Vash</a> to the building they were to fight on with a massive stain of blood on the ground for him to find. Using her powers, she managed to get behind Vash undetected, and told him that she could have killed him three times already, dropping three of the buttons of Vash's coat as proof. Vash however didn't wish to fight her, and instead demanded she tell him where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">Legato</a> was. Dominique wasn't willing to do so however, and proceeded to fight Vash, constantly managing to sneak up behind him and shoot him almost before he could react.</p><p>After narrowly dodging a few times, Vash was able to finally defeat Dominique by placing pressure on one of his wounds, allowing him to concentrate on the pain, realizing that he didn't feel the pain anymore as soon as Dominique used her eye. Vash soon ended the battle by shooting her directly in her right eye,</p><h3>Fifth Moon</h3><p>Defeated by Vash, Dominique admitted that she'd been no help to Legato, and so she committed suicide by jumping off the building that she and Vash had been fighting on. Vash tried to stop Dominique, but she would most likely have met a similar fate for her failure anyhow.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Dominique's main weapon is found in her right eye, which has an ability called \"Demon's Eye\", giving her the power to hypnotize her opponent and erase a small portion of their recent memory, temporarily stunning them and making it seem as if she moved at super speed. She activates this ability when she lifts the eye patch on her right eye.</p><h2>Anime Version</h2><p>The anime version of Dominique is nearly identical to her manga version, although her right eye is a red eye instead of being reptilian like in the manga. She is also the second Gung Ho Gun to face Vash, rather than the third.</p><p>The battle between her and Vash takes place outside the city that was nearby. She runs away after being defeated by Vash, but she doesn't get far because she is soon found by <a href=\"../../midvalley-the-hornfreak/29-67733/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Midvalley the Hornfreak</a>. Her body is later found mounted on a wall next to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67724\" href=\"/monev-the-gale/4005-67724/\" slug=\"monev-the-gale\">Monev the Gale</a>'s body. Although <a href=\"../../eg-mine/29-67726/\" rel=\"nofollow\">E.G. Mine</a> was facing Vash when he found their corpses, it is unknown whether he was the one to kill them or not.</p>",

Mine was created by <a href=\"../../yasuhiro-nightow/26-60661/\" rel=\"nofollow\">  Yasuhiro Nightow</a> for his <a href=\"../../trigun/49-29518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">  Trigun</a> series.<br/><h2>Major Story Arc<br/></h2><h3>Scars</h3>E.G. Mine was the second member of the Gung Ho Guns to face <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\" href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" slug=\"vash-the-stampede\">           Vash the Stampede</a>, right after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67724\" href=\"/monev-the-gale/4005-67724/\" slug=\"monev-the-gale\">            Monev the Gale</a>, whom he apparently killed for his failure. Despite considering himself greater than Monev, E.G. Mine was quickly defeated by Vash, who used one perfectly placed shot to cut the belt that was keeping E.G. Mine's suit together. Dumb-founded after witnessing Vash's quickness, he was finished with a single blow from Vash with a swing of his bag of supplies.  <br/>His final fate is unknown, but he was most likely killed by one of his fellow <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\">    Gung Ho Guns</a> for his failure, just like Monev.<br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>E.G. Mine wears a special suit that with two spike-covered half-spheres. He can control these spikes with threads tied to his fingers, allowing him to fire off a devastating volley of spikes with but a motion of his fingers.<br/>Although E.G. Mine doesn't seem to posses any inherent special  abilities, he does seem to be an unnaturally tall person, much taller  than Vash, who is already quite tall himself.<br/><h2>Anime Version</h2>One of the main differences between the manga and  anime versions of E.G. Mine is the difference in size, with the manga version  of E.G. Mine being much bigger and having many more spikes on his suit than the anime version. In the anime, he is also the third, rather than the second, Gung Ho Gun to face Vash, in this case right after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67725\" href=\"/dominique-the-cyclops/4005-67725/\" slug=\"dominique-the-cyclops\">   Dominique the Cyclops</a>.  <br/>Also, soon after he  is defeated by Vash, E.G. Mine faces <a href=\"../../rai-dei-the-blade/29-67727/\" rel=\"nofollow\">             Rai-Dei the Blade</a>, who manages to cut some of his spikes and soon afterwards stabs him with his sword, killing him almost instantaneously.",

    "deck": "Rai-Dei is the 4th member of the Gung Ho Guns to battle Vash. He is a highly skilled samurai with frightening speed and reflexes.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin<br/></h2>It is unknown where Rai-Dei came from or if he had any relatives; it is possible he is of Japanese descent. It is unknown where he learned his samurai techniques. He states that he has fought many battles and trained on the corpses of his enemies. Sometime in his past he gave up on his humanity in order to gain power, according to what he has said he apparently gave up his humanity in order to learn his samurai technique. <br/><h2>Creation</h2> Rai-Dei was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-60661\" href=\"/yasuhiro-nightow/4040-60661/\" slug=\"yasuhiro-nightow\">Yasuhiro Nightow</a> for his <a data-ref-id=\"4050-29518\" href=\"/trigun/4050-29518/\" slug=\"trigun\">Trigun</a> series.<br/><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><h3>Fifth Moon </h3>Rai-Dei was among those <a href=\"../../gung-ho-guns/65-57146/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                     Gung Ho Guns</a>   that witnessed <a href=\"../../millions-knives/29-58338/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Knives' </a>second  coming; he was also there when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">    Legato</a> was  crippled by Knives and when <a href=\"../../vash-the-stampede/29-40857/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                      Vash </a>made  a huge crater in the moon.  <br/><h3>Resume Our Business </h3>Two years later he was present at a meeting of the Gung Ho Guns, where they got their new objectives by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">       Legato</a>, primarily to make  Vash suffer rather than kill him, and destroy the image of humanity he made for himself. After this meeting, Rai-Dei went after Vash on a giant sandworm.  <br/>When he caught up to Vash, he challenged him to a death match, and was rather surprised to find fellow Gung Ho Guns member, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\" href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" slug=\"nicholas-d-wolfwood\">               Nicholas D Wolfwood</a>, with Vash. Rai-Dei however had no qualms about Wolfwood watching him battle Vash, so long as he didn't interrupt his match with Vash. The battle began quickly with Rai-Dei gaining the upper hand by surprising Vash with the speed of his blade, coupled with that of his special roller skates.  <br/><h3>Samurai Showdown</h3>Rai-Dei proved to deadly serious during this death match, unwilling to underestimating Vash in the least. <br/>After a few moves, Wolfwood tried to help Vash, but both Rai-Dai and Vash told him to stay out of it. Rai-Dei managed to dodge every bullet Vash threw at him, almost defeating him, but Vash used a combination of sumo technique with his gun style and managed to win, much to the chagrin of Rai-Dei. <br/><h3>Wolfwood</h3>After being defeated, Rai-Dei was given a chance to live a normal life by Vash, but he refused to take it, saying that he had given up on too much to get to this point and he tried to kill Vash from behind, but he was shot and killed by Wolfwood.<br/><h2>Powers and Abilities </h2>Rai-Dei has mastered what is called by him the strongest, lost sword style, known as Jigenzan Ittou, a samurai style that includes evading your opponent and crushing him afterwards. He also has a few weapons that help him in his mission to make Vash suffer, including a special samurai sword that enables him to create vibration waves that can even go through walls, and roller skates that give him incredible speed and mobility, to the point that he's able to evade many of Vash's shots. Rai-Dei is without a doubt one of the fastest members of the Gung Ho Guns. <br/><h2>Anime version</h2>The anime version of Rai-Dei the Blade is very  similar to the Rai-Dei of the manga, except for the fact that he does not  wear roller skates.  <br/>His battle with Vash also takes place in a city, and it is  ended by Vash when his Angel Arm is activated by Legato. Surviving  Vash's Angel Arm, he asks Wolfwood for help in his quest to  kill Vash the Stampede, but Wolfwood refuses and kills him. ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Not much is known about Leonof, except for the fact that his name isn't Leonof the Puppet-Master at all. His real name is Emilio the Player, who as a child was apparently a friend of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\" href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" slug=\"vash-the-stampede\">Vash the Stampede</a>. He always used to carry a wooden doll with him and he had a crush on a girl called Isabel. After the death of his love interest, he apparently buried himself in the art of his puppet-making to mend his broken spirit.</p><p>It is unknown just when he became a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\">Gung Ho Guns</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Leonof the Puppet-Master was created by <a href=\"../../yasuhiro-nightow/26-60661/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yasuhiro Nightow</a> for his <a href=\"../../trigun/49-29518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trigun</a> series.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Fifth Moon</h3><p>Leonof was among the Gung Ho Guns that met with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">Legato</a> when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58338\" href=\"/millions-knives/4005-58338/\" slug=\"millions-knives\">Knives</a> was healed and when Vash made a crater in the moon.</p><h3>Dancing Revolver</h3><p>Two years later, Leonof was in a city that was being ravished by two families who were trying to get a plant near the city. Unfortunately, the townspeople were caught in the crossfire of the conflict and Vash decided to help sort this out, while <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\" href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" slug=\"nicholas-d-wolfwood\">Wolfwood</a> decided to take a break. In the mean time, one of Leonof's puppets dressed as a man led a group of people to hijack a sandsteamer by ramming into it with an armed truck and taking several hostages. This proved to be a ruse to draw Vash out of hiding.</p><h3>Sin</h3><p>After completing his mission, the puppet was disassembled and returned to his suitcase before anyone became wise to its deception. Another of Leonof's puppets meanwhile reported to Legato on Vash's resurfacing.</p><h3>Return of the Blue Wind of Death</h3><p>Leonoff again used one of his puppets, this time a fly, to spy on Vash's friends. After this he and the other Gung Ho Guns have a meeting where they are explained their new objective: to make Vash suffer and destroy the image of humanity he made for himself.</p><h3>Home Sweet Home</h3><p>Following Vash's friends, Leonof was able to make his way to their home, a lost SEEDS ship that was still functioning, where he soon began massacring the people there with his puppets, after which he laid in wait for Vash. Arriving sometime later with Wolfwood, Vash was greeted by a family of old friends of his and was overjoyed to see them again. Vash was soon devastated however when Leonof revealed the people to be nothing but his puppets when he pulled them apart, having already killed those very people and used them to make the puppets. With that, Leonof welcomed Vash and Wolfwood to his puppet show.</p><h3>Darkness</h3><p>Disgusted with Leonof's methods, Wolfwood wasted no time as Leonof introduced himself and opened fire on him, only to find that Leonof had managed to shield himself with one of his puppets. Leonof then attacked Wolfwood with a giant doll made up of the body parts of dozens of his puppets, but it was quickly destroyed by Vash. <a href=\"///\">Gray the Ninelives</a> then stepped in and tried to kill Wolfwood, dragging him down into the a lower level of the ship as he crashed through the floor, leaving Vash to face off against Leonoff on his own.</p><h3>Reservoir Dogs</h3><p>Vash soon had to deal with another one of Leonof's giant dolls, this one made of all the human puppet parts left in the area, but Vash managed to destroy it before it could even touch him. Even Leonof admired Vash for his perfection, and openly stated how he wanted to make Vash into one of his puppets.</p><h3>No Escape</h3><p>Going into hiding, Leonof began playing more and more of his mind games on Vash, forcing him to search for him throughout the ship, all while attacking him with puppets modeled after his old friends. Leonof even staged an attack on a group of people, only to reveal that they were merely puppets after Vash saved them and they tried to shoot him in the back. Luckily, Vash managed to evade and shoot each of the puppets, only to realize that he'd accidentally injured an innocent girl that Leonof had hidden among his crowd of puppets. Grabbing the girl, Vash told Leanof that his time was up, except he called him Emilio the Player instead of Leonof.</p><h3>Emilio the Player</h3><p>Leonof was confused over just who this Emilio was, remarking that the name did sound very familiar. Vash then tried to jog Leonof's memory by stating the names of various people, and at the mention of one Isabel, Leonof suddenly became hysterical. Clearly hurt by his memories, but still refusing to acknowledge them, Leonof sent an army of puppets modeled after Vash's closest friends to kill him and the girl. Clearly outnumbered, Vash grabbed the girl and ran. It was then that he realized Leonof's weakness.</p><p>Hiding the girl, Vash climbed atop a tower and detonated a grenade high in the air, damaging a water system and causing water to rain down everywhere. Vash then told Leonof of how he'd discovered the strings that he'd been using to control his puppets with his fingertips, and with the water now weighing down all his puppets and strings, Leonof would be unable to use them anymore. The strings around his fingers now cutting into his flesh, Leonof was forced to release his puppets, and he collapsed on the floor. Defeated, Leonof asked Vash why he wouldn't kill him, at which Vash questioned Leonof if he'd truly forgotten everything, including Isabel. At the mention of Isabel, Leonof once again became hysterical and he desperately tried to get away from Vash. It was then Brad, a friend of Vash that had managed to survive, came across a mountain of coffins for Leonof's puppets, with one of them open and containing the body of a young woman.</p><h3>Long Goodbye</h3><p>Sensing the intruder at Isabel's coffin, Leonof attacked Brad with what was left of his puppets. During the struggle however, Isabel's coffin fell and Leonof rushed to catch it. While Leonof was distracted, Brad detached the section of the ship Leonof was on, forcing him and his coffins to fall to their doom. Leonf was saved by Vash however, who'd managed to grab onto him with his strings, while Leonof had managed to grab hold of Isabel's coffin. Unfortunately Leonof's fingers were too injured to hold on, and he unwillingly dropped Isabel's coffin. Overcome with both love and grief for his Isabel, Leonof had one of his dolls stab Vash, forcing him to let go. As Leonof fell to his death, he managed to remember a discussion he'd had with Vash back when he was just a kid.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1250726-vol3ch5_135.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1250726\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.8392156862745\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:183.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1250726-vol3ch5_135.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1250726\"><img alt=\"Young Emilio and Vash.\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1250726-vol3ch5_135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1250726-vol3ch5_135.jpg 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px\" data-width=\"255\"></a><figcaption>Young Emilio and Vash.</figcaption></figure><p>Leonof the Puppet-Master is an elderly man that uses puppets as weapons. He controls these puppets with an elaborate system of strings that are over 10 km long and thin enough to be nearly invisible, as well in conjunction with special spheres that can form subtle illusions to further hide his strings and make his puppets even more life-like.</p><p>He can make his puppets look like just about anything, including birds, insects, bats, small monsters, human beings, and he can even combine the body parts of his puppets to form giant monsters.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Not much is known about Gray the Ninelives, except for the fact that he isn't actually a person, but is instead nine small, deformed dwarfs that control a robotic suit made of metal and flesh. His name Ninelives therefore comes from the nine dwarves that operate him.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Gray the Ninelives was created by <a href=\"../../yasuhiro-nightow/26-60661/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yasuhiro Nightow</a> for his <a href=\"../../trigun/49-29518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trigun</a> series.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Fifth Moon</h3><p>Gray was among the members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\">Gung Ho Guns</a> that gathered at the church on the mountain where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58338\" href=\"/millions-knives/4005-58338/\" slug=\"millions-knives\">Knives</a> was healed up completely. He was also there when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\" href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" slug=\"vash-the-stampede\">Vash</a> made a crater in the moon.</p><h3>Return of the Blue Wind of Death</h3><p>Two years after this event, Gray is seen along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67733\" href=\"/midvalley-the-hornfreak/4005-67733/\" slug=\"midvalley-the-hornfreak\">Midvalley</a> hiding out at a ranch and having apparently been responsible for a rash of disappearances in the area. Having tracked the disappearances to the ranch, a sheriff and his task force of over forty officers, as well as a dangerous convict who was cooperating for a reduced sentence, gathered to storm the place. The convict wasted no time and impaled Gray with a massive, steel boomerang, laying waste to much of the ranch in the process. Gray however quickly got up afterwards and crushed the convict to a bloody pulp, simultaneously stabbing him with the boomerang that was still lodged in his chest. The rest of the task force was soon wiped out by other members of the Gung Ho Guns who were present.</p><p>A few days later, Gray was seen at the meeting of the Gung Ho Guns where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">Legato</a> told them their new objective: to make Vash suffer.</p><h3>Darkness</h3><p>After Vash successfully destroyed one of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67728\" href=\"/leonof-the-puppet-master/4005-67728/\" slug=\"leonof-the-puppet-master\">Leonof the Puppet-Master</a>'s attacks aboard the SEEDS ship, Gray came up through the floor and dragged <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\" href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" slug=\"nicholas-d-wolfwood\">Wolfwood</a> down with him to the lower level. Leaving Vash to face Leonof by himself.</p><h3>Reservoir Dogs</h3><p>Gray tried numerous times to crush Wolfwood with his hands, but he managed to dodge and counter with the machine gun in his cross each time. Despite being severely injured, Gray kept on coming, much to Wolfwood's disbelief.</p><h3>Cement</h3><p>Furious, Gray grabbed his guns: two hand-held cannons. Quick as ever, Wolfwood managed to dodge Gray's shots and let loose with his cross, shooting Gray relentlessly. No matter how many times Gray got shot however, he just kept on coming, only getting angrier and angrier, with not even numerous head shots slowing him down. Tossing one of his cannons at Wolfwood as a distraction, Gray managed to catch him off guard and hurled himself at him, breaking some of Wolfwood's ribs with a punch from his remaining right-hand cannon. Immediately after striking him, Gray shot off a cannonball and almost killed Wolfwood with the resulting explosion, while also separating him from his cross. Going in for the kill, Gray let loose another cannonball, only for Wolfwood to shoot it with one of his pistols and explode it prematurely right in Gray's face, nearly blowing off his right arm. In an attempt to grab Wolfwood, Gray ended up getting his right arm severed off when Wolfwood closed an automatic door over it. Glad to have separated himself from Gray, Wolfwood failed to notice that Gray's severed arm was still moving.</p><h3>No Escape</h3><p>With the use of his severed arm, Gray was able to open the door back up, only to be met by a shot from the rocket launcher end of Wolfwood's cross. The rocket did massive damage, but even with his body now barely in one piece, Gray kept on pursuing Wolfwood who used his machine gun to open up what was left of Gray's belly. When he saw what was inside Gray, Wolfwood stabbed him with his cross and began shooting.</p><h3>Long Goodbye</h3><p>When Gray's body finally stopped moving, the dwarfs that operated him started coming out, only to be attacked by Wolfwood who proceeded to beat them to death with his fists. Thinking he'd beaten Gray for good, Wolfwood failed to notice one of Gray's remaining drivers about to kill him with what was left of Gray's body. It was then that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74329\" href=\"/meryl-stryfe/4005-74329/\" slug=\"meryl-stryfe\">Meryl</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-73536\" href=\"/milly-thompson/4005-73536/\" slug=\"milly-thompson\">Milly</a> dropped in out of nowhere and crushed what was left of Gray's body, saving a very surprised Wolfwood.</p><h3>His Life as a...</h3><p>In the end, two of Gray's drivers managed to survive, who were both captured and thrown into a jail cell aboard the ship. They quickly escaped however when some of the ship's surviving residents came to punish them for what they'd done to their families. The Gray drivers ended up going after Meryl and Milly, but Vash was luckily there to save them with his bulletproof coat. Unarmed and unprotected, Vash was about to be killed by the Gray dwarfs, until Wolfwood stepped in and knocked them out from behind.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Gray the Ninelives is the powerhouse of the Gung Ho Guns. He possesses immense strength and his armor is considerably durable, being made of a combination of metal and flesh. Despite his size, Gray is also shown to be quite agile.</p><p>Gray has two guns, a pair of hand-held cannons that shoot explosive cannonballs. These guns can also be used as armored boxing gloves of sorts, and can be thrown as projectiles.</p><p>What makes Gray the Ninelives so dangerous however, is that he does in fact have nine lives because he is actually a robotic suit operated by nine dwarf drivers. These drivers are well protected inside Gray's body and are distributed throughout it, shown when one of Gray's severed arms could still move on its own. Even when Gray's body is severely damaged, he can still function as long as one of his operators is still present. Therefore, in order to defeat Gray completely, each of his nine operators has to be defeated.</p><p>Even without Gray's body, the dwarfs that operate it have been shown to be incredibly vicious and dangerous opponents.</p><h2>Anime Version</h2><p>The anime version of Gray the Ninelives is a little different from his manga counterpart. For starters, he is apparently a cyborg rather than a robot with nine dwarfs operating it, and he's also shown to have several more weapons built into his body, including machine guns built into his fingers, missile launchers built into his chest, and rocket launchers in his legs.</p><p>Just like in the manga, Gray ends up being killed by Wolfwood, except Gray comes to the SEEDS ship along with both Leonof the Puppet-Master and <a href=\"../../hoppered-the-gauntlet/29-67730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hoppered the Gauntlet</a> in order to destroy the plants that power the ship and kill everyone dear to Vash. The battle between Gray and Wolfwood proves to be very intense, with Gray's armor being completely bulletproof against Wolfwood's cross. Gray is revealed to be a cyborg when Wolfwood manages to shoot out a pipe filled with corrosive acid over Gray that eats away his armored skin, after which Wolfwood blows off Gray's torso with his rocket launcher. Gray's legs manage to keep going however, as his brain was still intact and still attached, and he uses his leg-mounted rocket launcher to destroy the ship's plant before Wolfwood is able to stop him.</p>",

    "deck": "A veritable human bullet, Hoppered the Gauntlet is the 6th member of the Gung Ho Guns, and has a personal grudge against Vash the Stampede.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Hoppered was originally an inhabitant of the city of July. Before it was destroyed, Hoppered was a beggar with deformed legs that took care of a blind and mute woman. After July was destroyed and the woman was killed along with it, he blamed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\" href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" slug=\"vash-the-stampede\">Vash the Stampede</a> and eventually became a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\">Gung Ho Guns</a> to get revenge, not knowing that it was in fact <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58338\" href=\"/millions-knives/4005-58338/\" slug=\"millions-knives\">Knives</a> who'd used Vash to destroy the city.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Hoppered the Gauntlet was created by <a href=\"../../yasuhiro-nightow/26-60661/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yasuhiro Nightow</a> for his <a href=\"../../trigun/49-29518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trigun</a> series.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Fifth Moon</h3><p>Hoppered was among the Gung Ho Guns that witnessed the rebirth of Knives; he was also there when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">Legato</a> was crippled by Knives and when Vash made a huge crater in the moon.</p><h3>Return of the Blue Wind of Death</h3><p>Two years after this, Hoppered, along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67729\" href=\"/gray-the-ninelives/4005-67729/\" slug=\"gray-the-ninelives\">Gray the Ninelives</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67733\" href=\"/midvalley-the-hornfreak/4005-67733/\" slug=\"midvalley-the-hornfreak\">Midvalley the Hornfreak</a>, and Legato massacred an entire police task force that sought to apprehend them for a rash of disappearances. Hoppered's role in the attack was rather small compared to the other Gung Ho Guns, as he mostly supervised some of the soldiers that had been left alive after Midvalley's attacks, after which Legato came in and used his powers to force the soldiers to crush their bodies together inside a container.</p><h3>Resume Our Business</h3><p>After that, the Gung Ho Guns went to meet with Legato, who gave them their new objective: to make Vash suffer and destroy his vision of humanity. When Midvalley started explaining how they should instead take out both Vash and Knives, as he considered them both monsters that were a threat to humankind, Hoppered was the one who tried to stop Midvalley, but with little luck, causing Midvalley to receive considerable punishment from Legato.</p><h3>Bottom of the Dark</h3><p>During their journey to confront Vash, Hoppered and Midvalley conversed over their place in the plans of Knives, and how win or lose against Vash, they probably wouldn't be much use to Knives soon. Hoppered was okay with this however, as he saw his only purpose in life to be getting revenge upon Vash, even asking Midvalley to wipe away all traces of him after their task was done, provided he survived.</p><h3>Den of Thieves</h3><p>Hoppered and Midvalley later met with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67732\" href=\"/zazie-the-beast/4005-67732/\" slug=\"zazie-the-beast\">Zazie the Beast</a> at Dragon's Nest Mountain after he kidnapped <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74329\" href=\"/meryl-stryfe/4005-74329/\" slug=\"meryl-stryfe\">Meryl</a>. When Hoppered saw her he tried to break into the cage she was held in because he couldn't stand the thought of her being a friend of Vash, but he eventually stopped caring about her when he realized she didn't even know anything about Vash and July.</p><h3>Crying Wild Bullet</h3><p>As soon as Vash and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\" href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" slug=\"nicholas-d-wolfwood\">Wolfwood</a>, as well as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-73536\" href=\"/milly-thompson/4005-73536/\" slug=\"milly-thompson\">Milly</a>, came into the city of Dragon's Nest Mountain, Hoppered and Midvalley attacked and seperated the them, with Midvalley going after Wolfwood while Hoppered went after Vash.</p><h3>Those Who Stood Idly By</h3><p>Their battle quickly became very violent, with Hoppered having no regard for civilians, only focused on Vash, whom he began telling about the July incident, and how Vash had taken everything from him when he destroyed it. Hoppered used his shell to barrel through the city, mowing down countless buildings around Vash as he kept reminding him of July.</p><h3>Doomed Sinner</h3><p>Starting to remember what he'd done to July, Vash agreed with Hoppered that he should die, but only after he'd settled things with Knives. Bored with how Vash resigned himself to his fate, Hoppered taunted Vash with how his fellow Gung Ho Guns would probably have some fun with Meryl, and he left to meet up with Midvalley.</p><h3>The City, and Then the Banquet of the Dogs</h3><p>With the use of Midvalley's sound-dampening techniques, Hoppered was able to sneak up on Zazie and kill him, as he and Midvalley didn't want him reporting to Legato or Knives on how they were planning to actually kill Vash rather than just make him suffer.</p><h3>Break Out</h3><p>As Vash was making his way towards Meryl, Hoppered and Midvalley used the same technique they'd used on Zazie to try and kill Vash in one shot, but Wolfwood and Milly managed to disrupt Midvalley's sound-dampening just before Hoppered was able to collide with Vash at full force.</p><h3>Loss</h3><p>Surviving Hoppered's attack despite being hit, Vash's angel arm begins to transform, allowing Hoppered witness Vash's memories of July and how Knives was the one to use him to destroy the city, but also forcing him to relive the death of the woman he'd cared for.</p><h3>Villain</h3><p>Desperately trying to stop the memory, Hoppered sets off several bombs that he'd placed in the building as a last resort. Vash was able to absorb the blast however, allowing everyone to survive. It was then that Midvalley stepped in to kill Hoppered as per their agreement, only to be interrupted by Wolfwood, who was looking to finish their fight. They're interrupted by Legato however and Midvalley tries to kill him, only to be shot and killed by a Legato-controlled Hoppered.</p><h3>Death Deal</h3><p>Zazie then steps in, having been the one to contact Legato after occupying a new body, this time the body of a young girl. There is then a Mexican standoff between Wolfwood, Zazie, Hoppered, and Legato, with Legato being unable to control everyone because he's too busy restraining Vash. The standoff finally ignites when Meryl comes up from behind Vash and shoots Legato. Hoppered immediately shoots Legato as well, while Wolfwood shoots Zazie, and Hoppered and Wolfwood are both shot by Zazie. Infuriated over Hoppered's disloyalty, Legato uses Midvalley's dead body to try and finish him off, but he's distracted by Vash when starts to charge up his angel arm cannon, only for it to be disrupted when an enormous nail is fired at him.</p><h3>Let Us Walk the Path to Redemption</h3><p>Someone then appears and orders Legato to retreat, but Legato stills wants to kill Hoppered with Midvalley's body. Vash manages to regain control of his angel arm however and uses it to shield Hoppered. Legato then attempts to kill Vash for interfering, but he is stopped by the person who ordered him to retreat, now formerly introduced as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67736\" href=\"/elendira-the-crimsonnail/4005-67736/\" slug=\"elendira-the-crimsonnail\">Elendira the Crimsonnai</a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-67736\" href=\"/elendira-the-crimsonnail/4005-67736/\" slug=\"elendira-the-crimsonnail\">l</a>, the \"lost number\" thirteen of the Gung Ho Guns, who forcibly extracts Legato. Succumbing to his injuries, Hoppered tells Vash that he doesn't want to kill him anymore, because he wants him to suffer through the world's miseries for the rest of his life. Hoppered then passes away with the memory of the woman he'd loved as his last thought. He is later buried alongside Midvalley.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Hoppered the Gauntlet is a man with deformed and vestigial legs, who is covered by a suit of bullet-like armor and uses his large arms to move around. His armor is immensely durable, having been shown to withstand bullets and staying intact even after massive impacts. Hoppered is able to launch himself with great velocity, allowing him to turn himself into a living bullet and plow through just about anything in his path. He also has a spiked hammer that he uses to move himself around that doubles as a gun, with which he has shown considerable skill and accuracy.</p><h2>Anime Version</h2><p>Hoppered was one of the Gung Ho Guns member that fought Vash in the flying city. His appearance in the anime was very similar to how he appeared in the manga, with his bullet-like armor, except his armor apparently had a built-in machine gun in this version. He is defeated by Vash after he uses some <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67728\" href=\"/leonof-the-puppet-master/4005-67728/\" slug=\"leonof-the-puppet-master\">Leonof the Puppet-Master</a>'s invisible wire to trap him. Hoppered later resurfaces however and launches himself into the plant that was powering the ship, killing himself and causing the ship to crash.</p><p>The anime does not feature any of Hoppered's back-story, with his desire to make Vash suffer simply being part of his role as a Gung Ho Gun in this case.</p>",

During times when affairs called T'Challa out of the country, N'Gassi acted as regent in his stead. When T'Challa's half-brother, Jakarra, transformed into an inhuman monster and began running amok throughout the central districts, N'Gassi coordinated his efforts with the royal family in the hopes of either finding the Black Panther, or selecting a dutiful replacement to carry on the title. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Zazie the Beast is actually a legion of insects that were the original inhabitants of planet <a href=\"/planet-gunsmoke/4020-57257/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57257\">Gunsmoke</a>. The first other being they ever saw was <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/millions-knives/4005-58338/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58338\">Knives</a>, who interested them greatly. It is unknown how they became members of the <a href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\">Gung Ho Guns</a>, but from what they said through their hosts, they at first had hoped to live harmoniously with humans and plants, but they eventually decided they'd be more inclined to living with plants likes Knives.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h4>Knives Reborn and The Gathering</h4><p>Zazie is seen at the resurfacing of Knives; he along with <a href=\"/leonof-the-puppet-master/4005-67728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67728\">Leonof</a>, <a href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\">Legato</a>, <a href=\"/rai-dei-the-blade/4005-67727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67727\">Rai-Dei</a>, <a href=\"/gray-the-ninelives/4005-67729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67729\">Gray the Ninelives</a>, <a href=\"/midvalley-the-hornfreak/4005-67733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67733\">Midvalley </a>and <a href=\"/hoppered-the-gauntlet/4005-67730/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67730\">Hoppered </a>where there when Knives made <a href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\">Vash</a> shoot with his Angel Arm into the moon, this lead to the formation of a huge crater on it. Two years later he is seen along with the Gung Ho Guns having a discussion on the true objective of the Gung Ho Guns: to make <a href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\">Vash </a>suffer and to destroy his image of humanity. He is later seen observing a fight between Vash and <a href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\">Wolfwood</a>, after Wolfwood killed Rai-Dei, who was trying to kill Vash, after losing to him.</p><h4>Bottom of the Dark</h4><p>After that, Zazie used one of his insects to spy on Vash's friends <a href=\"/milly-thompson/4005-73536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73536\">Milly</a> and <a href=\"/meryl-stryfe/4005-74329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74329\">Meryl</a>, who stopped a bad guy from harassing a girl in the town that they'd brought Vash and Wolfwood to for medical attention. He met with Midvalley and Hoppered after he kidnapped Meryl, to use her as bait. He then went to Vash and Wolfwood to give them the news. While the others were battling, Zazie decided to tell Meryl about Vash and Knives and how they were not actually humans but plants. Zazie was trying to see who was the winner of the two battles, but he is ultimately killed by Midvalley and Hoppered. Zazie is seen later inhabiting a new body, a young girl's body, and also manages to shoot Wolfwood and Hoppered. He is later seen after the intervention of <a href=\"/elendira-the-crimsonnail/4005-67736/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67736\">Elendira</a>, at the hospital treating his new human body.</p><h4>Cross X and Zero Hour</h4><p>Zazie has a little discussion with Wolfwood in the town that he and Vash were resting. He is later seen on Knives' Ark, were \"they\" (the legion of insects known as Zazie) have a little discussion with Elendira, where they tell him that Wolfwood and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/chapel-the-evergreen/4005-67734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67734\">Chapel</a> are dead, and that <a href=\"/livio-the-double-fang/4005-67737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67737\">Livio and Razlo</a> have joined Vash in his quest. They also say that they want to live in peace with either humans or plants. Zazie then takes down Elendira, and tries to take over Knives' body using a worm, but she is stopped by Legato, and Zazie's body is destroyed moments later by Knives. Still, the colony of insects uses another body to give Vash Zazie's Gung Ho Gun coin that he needed.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Zazie is actually a colony of insects and worms that use a host as a means to continue their lives. They thought they could live along with plants and humans, but later they try to take over the plant population, but are defeated by Legato and Knives. They can paralyze their opponents, inhabit other people's bodies, and the bodies they inhabited typically had very good marksmanship. Zazie has also claimed that he/they can naturally feel the emotions of other living things.</p><p> </p><h2>Anime version</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1043170\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1043170-zazie_the_beast.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1043170-zazie_the_beast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043170\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1043170-zazie_the_beast.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54482/1043170-zazie_the_beast.jpg 640w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54482/1043170-zazie_the_beast.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54482/1043170-zazie_the_beast.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>In the anime Zazie is actually a troubled boy known as Bete, and though he looks like a normal boy, he is as deadly as any member of the <a href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\">Gung Ho Guns. </a>His main weapons are .45 revolvers that he uses with very high precision. Zazie also has a high-frequency sound emitter in his ear, which he uses to control the giant worms in the desert surrounding the area. After Vash destroys that sound emitter, Zazie reveals himself and then proudly admits to being who he truly is, a Gung Ho Gun, and he expresses his hatred for the children that he had hidden among and that Vash had been protecting. He attempts to kill Vash with his gun, but Vash manages to dodge the shot and tries to talk some sense into him but is given no chance, as Zazie is killed seconds later by <a href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\">Wolfwood</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Apparently Midvalley was a killer long before he became part of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\">Gung Ho Guns</a>. In the past, he was part of a small band of jazz musicians that doubled as killers for hire. One day, after killing an entire bar full of people to get their target, Midvalley and his band were greeted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58338\" href=\"/millions-knives/4005-58338/\" slug=\"millions-knives\">Knives</a>, who proclaimed he was thoroughly impressed with their methods. Midvalley was cautious of Knives, but his comrades were not and tried to kill him for witnessing what they'd done. Knives butchered them in mere seconds however, and took Midvalley on as a member of his Gung Ho Guns.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Midvalley the Hornfreak was created by <a href=\"../../yasuhiro-nightow/26-60661/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yasuhiro Nightow</a> for his <a href=\"../../trigun/49-29518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trigun</a> series.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Fifth Moon</h3><p>Midvalley was among those Gung Ho Guns that witnessed Knives' second coming, he was also there when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">Legato</a> was crippled by Knives, as well as when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\" href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" slug=\"vash-the-stampede\">Vash</a> made a huge crater in the moon.</p><h3>Return of the Blue Wind of Death</h3><p>Two years after this, Midvalley, along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67729\" href=\"/gray-the-ninelives/4005-67729/\" slug=\"gray-the-ninelives\">Gray the Ninelives</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67730\" href=\"/hoppered-the-gauntlet/4005-67730/\" slug=\"hoppered-the-gauntlet\">Hoppered the Gauntlet</a>, and Legato, crushed an entire police task force that had come to apprehend them. With the use of his sonic attacks, Midvalley made short work of many of the soldiers, after which Legato used his powers to crush the remaining soldiers together inside a container.</p><h3>Resume Our Business</h3><p>Afterwards, Midvalley was invited by Legato to the meeting of the Gung Ho Guns, along with Gray, Hoppered, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67727\" href=\"/rai-dei-the-blade/4005-67727/\" slug=\"rai-dei-the-blade\">Rai-Dei the Blade</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67732\" href=\"/zazie-the-beast/4005-67732/\" slug=\"zazie-the-beast\">Zazie the Beast</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67728\" href=\"/leonof-the-puppet-master/4005-67728/\" slug=\"leonof-the-puppet-master\">Leonof the Puppet-Master</a>. Having seen the power of Vash, he began complaining to Legato how they should defend humanity from beings like Vash and Knives, even going so far as to threatening Legato. This proved to be a huge mistake however, as Legato nearly broke Midvalley in half with his powers as a warning. Legato then explained their new objective: to make Vash suffer and destroy the image of humanity he'd made for himself.</p><h3>Bottom of the Dark</h3><p>During their journey to confront Vash, Hoppered conversed with Midvalley over their place in the plans of Knives, and how win or lose against Vash, they probably wouldn't be much use to Knives soon. Hoppered was okay with this however, as he saw his only purpose in life to be getting revenge upon Vash, even asking Midvalley to wipe away all traces of him after their task was done, provided he survived. Midvalley reluctantly agreed, sympathizing with how Hoppered had resigned himself to his fate.</p><h3>Den of Thieves</h3><p>Midvalley and Hoppered later met with Zazie the Beast at Dragon's Nest Mountain after he'd kidnapped <a href=\"../../meryl-stryfe/29-74329/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meryl</a>. With Meryl as bait, the three Gung Ho Guns lured Vash and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\" href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" slug=\"nicholas-d-wolfwood\">Wolfwood</a>, as well as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-73536\" href=\"/milly-thompson/4005-73536/\" slug=\"milly-thompson\">Milly</a> who'd tagged along for Meryl's sake, to the mountain and right into their ambush.</p><h3>Crying Wild Bullet</h3><p>Hoppered quickly split up Vash and Wolfwood, leaving Vash for himself and Wolfwood for Midvalley, who immediately used his \"Ultra Shock Sonic Web\" on him, incapacitating him so that he couldn't interfere with Hoppered's battle against Vash. To Midvalley's suprise, Wolfwood quickly woke up, and used his rocket launcher to try and blow Hoppered away, while also nearly scorching off half of Midvalley's face, making Midvalley realize that he'd better not underestimate Wolfwood as he was a Gung Ho Gun just like him. Midvalley was unable to counterattack however as his saxophone was damaged, and so he slipped away to repair it.</p><h3>The City, and Then the Banquet of the Dogs</h3><p>Midvalley then met up with Hoppered, who'd momentarily postponed his fight with Vash, and together they ganged up on Zazie to prevent him from reporting to Legato or Knives of their plan to actually kill Vash rather than make him suffer. Using his mastery of sound, Midvalley neutralized the sound of Hoppered's attack, allowing him to sneak up on Zazie and kill him.</p><h3>Break Out</h3><p>As Vash was making his way towards Meryl, Midvalley and Hoppered planned to use the same technique they'd used on Zazie to try and kill Vash in one shot, but Wolfwood and Milly managed to disrupt Midvalley's sound-dampening just before Hoppered was able to collide with Vash at full force, resulting in another face off between Midvalley and Wolfwood.</p><h3>Loss</h3><p>Midvalley hoped that attacking Milly would distract Wolfwood and give him an opening, but Wolfwood managed to defend her and himself even with his eyesight still on the fritz from Midvalley's initial attack, and so Midvalley slipped away once again.</p><h3>Villain</h3><p>Unable to beat Vash, Hoppered set off several explosives he'd planted in the area as a last resort. Vash was able to absorb the blast however, allowing everyone to survive. Midvalley then approached Hoppered to kill him as per their agreement, but Wolfwood, with his eyesight now fully returned, interrupted him in order to finish their fight. They were in turn interrupted by Legato however, who came to retrieve Hoppered and Midvalley. Unwilling to abide by Legato's orders and let Vash live, Midvalley tried to kill him, only to be shot and killed by a Legato-controlled Hoppered.</p><h3>Death Deal</h3><p>Legato then crushed Midvalley's body beneath his bike for good measure, and later uses his powers to force Midvalley's dead body to kill Hoppered for his betrayal.</p><h3>Let us Walk the Path to Redemption</h3><p>Vash however is able to shield Hoppered from Midvalley's attacks, and Legato is soon afterwards forcibly extracted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67736\" href=\"/elendira-the-crimsonnail/4005-67736/\" slug=\"elendira-the-crimsonnail\">Elendira the Crimsonnail</a>, the \"lost number\" thirteen of the Gung Ho Guns. Hoppered eventually passes away due to his injuries though, and Midvalley is buried beside him with his saxophone hung on his tombstone.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Midvalley is a musician with impressive skill in playing his saxophone, Sylvia, with which he is able synchronize sound waves with pain receptors in the human body, causing immense physical damage, and even killing. He is also capable of neutralizing sounds by playing counter-frequencies, creating absolute silence.</p><p>Although he primarily makes use of his sound-based attacks, Midvalley is also a skilled gunman. His saxophone has a hidden gun built into it, and he also carries some more conventional pistols with him.</p><h2>Anime Version</h2><p>In the anime, Midvalley is much more loyal to Legato, acting as his bodyguard, as well as leading the Gung Ho Guns under his orders. He ends up being killed in a confrontation with Vash, who shot his saxophone to disable it, after which Midvalley tried to use his sax's built-in machine gun, only for it to explode and kill him due to the damage it had sustained.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Chapel along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67737\" href=\"/livio-the-double-fang/4005-67737/\" slug=\"livio-the-double-fang\">                      Livio </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\" href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" slug=\"nicholas-d-wolfwood\">                     Wolfwood </a>are considered among the best assassins the Eye of Michael ever made. He is also the person that trained the two, Livio and Wolfwood, he lost his legs after Razlo killed nine members of the Eye of Michael, he takes the blame and shoots himself, begging the Eye of Michael council not to kill Livio, for he had great potential.<br/><h2>Cross X </h2>Chapel is first seen when he and Livio are invited to be part of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\">                    Gung Ho Guns</a>, he brings with him a \"army\" as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">                   Legato </a>calls it, a few members of the Eye of Michael organization, and Livio who was carrying two dead intruders. The two are given two coins and are sent after Vash, Chapel also witnesses Knives's ascension, he is also there with Livio, they begin to attack Wolfwood, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67736\" href=\"/elendira-the-crimsonnail/4005-67736/\" slug=\"elendira-the-crimsonnail\">               Elendira </a>tells them to to stop, because if the don't he would kill them, they leave Wolfwood alone, for the moment. After Knives, Legato and Elendira took Vash, he, Livio and Wolfwood quickly followed in their path of destruction on foot, he constantly criticized Wolfwood for not killing the once opposing Knives. After Wolfwood once again betrays the Gung Ho Guns,  and goes after Vash, when he escapes, Livio and Chapel, confront him and  take him down, but Vash steps in and saves him with his Angel Arm.  <br/><h2>The Return </h2>After the escape of Wolfwood, he and Livio, decide to pay a little visit to the orphanage Wolfwood was raised in, using the caretaker and a few children as bait to lure Wolfwood there and they succeed. Nicholas makes his way to the orphanage, but doesn't kill a single, this enrages him. When Livio begins to show his abilities he begins to explain how the serum Livio took made him more stronger than Wolfwood. He tries to kill Wolfwood when Livio is taken down, but he loses to Wolfwood in mere seconds, later when Razlo defeats Wolfwood, but his happiness is cut short when Wolfwood rises once more. After a brutal battle he tries to kill Wolfwood, but as soon as he shoots, Wolfwood takes two batches of the serum, Wolfwood then breaks his neck, thinking he is dead, Wolfwood continues his battle with Razlo, but as he is ready to kill Razlo, he is shot with the sharp part of Chapel's cross in the arm, thinking Chapel was aiming for him, Razlo uses his machine gun and kills Chapel once and for all.<br/> <br/><h2>Anime version</h2>The anime version of Chapel is very different from his manga counterpart, he is a bald man with glasses and he doesn't have a mustache and beard. Chapel is the person that raised Nicholas after Wolfwood killed his abusive guardian. He comes to town to give Wolfwood the good news, that Wolfwood is a member of the Gung Ho Guns, Nicholas refuses, the two battle, Nicholas wins the battle, Legato takes control of Chapel's body and kills Nicholas, he then tries to kill Legato but is killed by Knives.<br/><h2>Powers and abilities</h2>Chapel is an expert assassin, he has trained both Nicholas Wolfwood and Razlo/Livio, it is possible he took the serum to improve his abilities, serum that offers a better marksmanship, healing abilities and a very strong body. He uses a Punisher cross, very similar to Wolfwood's but it has sharp edges, that he can use to stab his enemies. In the manga he uses a wheelchair to more around, in the anime Chapel also uses coffins to trick his opponents, he also carries a Punisher cross, that can split into twin machine guns.",

    "deck": "Former member of the Gung Ho Guns, Nicholas D Wolfwood carries a giant crucifix which is secretly a mighty weapon called the Punisher.  He is the closest thing Vash the Stampede has to a friend.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Nicholas D Wolfwood was a orphaned boy, while he was at the orphanage he was given the task to take care of a little baby girl, she eventually grows up a little and is adopted. Years later he finds her again, her name was Maylene, she was to marry some rich guy from the city to pay her grandpa's debt, but she refused. Wolfwood eventually fights him, and beats him, he leaves her be.  <br/>He meet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67737\" href=\"/livio-the-double-fang/4005-67737/\" slug=\"livio-the-double-fang\">     Livio </a>when he was still at the orphanage, he went to Livio and asked him why was he so shy, but Livio didn't tell, with Wolfwood insisting more and more, the two finally became friends, but they became best friends after a incident at the orphanage. A small girl named Jasmine followed a dog on a rooftop, she got scared and couldn't get down, Wolfwood tried to save her but failed, when she fell on the ground, Livio stepped in and caught her, the two became very good friends after this. Later that same knight the same dog was killed, Nicholas who was helping another kid go to the bathroom, saw a Livio with a very fearsome expression on his face, when he woke up he had his hands covered in blood, although others accused him of killing that dog, the caretaker of the orphanage found him innocent, later that day Livio disappeared. Later on he becomes member of the Eye of Michael, an assassin organization, that worships Knives, he is trained by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67734\" href=\"/chapel-the-evergreen/4005-67734/\" slug=\"chapel-the-evergreen\">      Chapel the Evergreen</a>. And he recieve his weapon the Punisher, a weapon that is part of 10 unique weapons, from Chapel, it was specifically made just for him.<br/>Although he looks like a adult, like Livio his age was enhanced due to  experiments performed on them by the Eye of Michael. It seems sometime in the past he  shoot Livio in an attempt to kill him, but he failed.   <br/><h2>Meeting Vash</h2> After his motorbike conveniently broke in the middle of the desert, a bus happed to be going by and luckily for him, he was spotted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\" href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" slug=\"vash-the-stampede\">                                                     Vash</a>. Nearly fainted because he went on a trip trough the dessert with no water, Wolfwood tied his motorbike on the top of the bus and went to town with Vash and the rest of the crew (Milly Thompson and Meryl Stryfe). On the bus he revealed his profession and quickly befriended with Vash. <br/><h2>Knives reborn<br/></h2>Chapel or Nicholas joined the party, he was a little late but  he wasn't late for the party that was held in a church. The  \"resurrection\" of  was a very painful one, as Vash who was fainted at  the time, woke up and started screaming of Knives return. Wakened and  wounded after his previous battle, he rushed to the church on the  mountain, only to find a crippled <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">                                                  Legato </a>at the hands of <a href=\"../../millions-knives/29-58338/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                                                          Millions  Knives</a>. A few minutes later Knives made his move on Vash, using his  superior speed in mere seconds Knives left Legato, grabbed Vash and  nearly destroyed them all using Vash's angel arm, luckily Vash manged to  move his arm, the ray of energy hitting the moon in the sky above them,  leaving a huge crater in it. Amazed by their power Nicholas began asking himself if the were humans or simply God's  servants, angels. It seems Wolfwood tried to kill Knives that time, but he was overwhelmed by a lot of feelings, about the group that raised him, The Eye of Michael, a group that worship Knives, and he wanted to live. Also Knives told him to take care of Vash and not to let anyone harm him till the end.<br/> <br/><h2>Get Vash</h2> 2 years passed since the return of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58338\" href=\"/millions-knives/4005-58338/\" slug=\"millions-knives\">                                                    Knives </a>and Vash was nowhere to be found, so Wolfwood went after Vash in a quest to stop Knives from becoming stronger. He managed to find in a town a person named Eriks, a very strange character but he was Vash the Stampede, the real one, in this lovely little town there was a gang, who was lead by Vash (this Vash was a, just another member of the gang). Unfortunately for the real Vash, they wanted the girl that was taking care of Vash for the last few years, Lina was her name, since she kicked the leader of the gang in the face. Eriks decided to agree to anything they asked from him, except the part where he would give up Lina. The false Vash demanded that Eriks would strip naked and make like a dog, and they would let the girl go, Eriks did just that, unfortunately for him, at the end of his performance he was shot by the false Vash, and the gang left with Lina anyway. Eriks was rushed to the hospital, the doctor manged to get the bullet out of him and in moment he was recovered, meanwhile Lina's' grandmother came to the hospital, rying to find out who did this to Eriks and Lina, threatening to go after them with a rifle from the hospital. <br/>She was calmed quickly after she found out that Eriks and Nicholas were on the case, the two went in after Lina facing not to great odds there were two of them against 60 bandits, the two rescued Lina and left not knowing they hadn't taken care of the guy that Lina kicked earlier. After they victory over the gang of bandits, Nicholas and Vash had a little chat about Knives and a little battle withe the leader of the gang of bandits and one of his men, Vash took a hair cut and left with Nicholas in the wind. A few days later, the Bernadelli Insurance Company send a new insurance agent, who's idea of keeping Vash in check and out of trouble was killing him, unfortunetly for him Nicholas and the insurance girls that were following Vash about 2 years before were there to stop him. Unfortunately for the Vash's attacker he was crippled by Nicholas in the very hospital he was taken to be healed.  <br/>A few days later during their journeys he and Vash stopped in a city at war, to receive a package, the town was being destroyed by 2 rival families who were trying to get their hands on the plant nearby. After the conflict ended with Vash being send to jail along with the attackers of the sandsteamer, Nicholas used his motorbike and cross to break Vash and one of the attackers out. <br/> After this he and Vash take the motorcycle and head after Knives in a city had all it's population mysteriously disappear, and the name Knives was written of a monument in the same city, unfortunately for them trouble never comes alone, they meet with Rai-Dei the Blade, who calanged Vash to a death match. Wolfwood steeped aside and left the two battle each other. When the battle started he tried to help Vash, but both Vash and Rai-Dei told him to stay out of it. After the battle between the two has ended, Rai-Dei tries to kill Vash from behind, but Nicholas steps in and shoots him, killing Rai-Dei. He then has a fight with Vash, on who is right, while the two of the were fighting, it seems that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67732\" href=\"/zazie-the-beast/4005-67732/\" slug=\"zazie-the-beast\">                                           Zazie the Beast</a>, another member of the Gung Ho Guns, was watching their every move. After that battle, both Nicholas and Vash went to a small town, while Vash was trying to save a few people, he made a introspection on what happened, at the end of it all Vash and the family he was helping, were attacked by the bandit they fought, but Wolfwood stepped in and helped and defeated the bandit. <br/>  <br/><h2>The Puppet Show</h2>After a few days, Nicholas and Vash made their way towards The Great  Melca Border Sand Ocean, using a mountain chairlift to transport them  over the Sand Ocean, they were heading towards Vash's home, a place full  of friends of his, where he was healed in the past, one of the  spaceships used to get to get to Gunsmoke planet. Unfortunately for the  two, Vash's friend died a very long time ago, <a href=\"///\">                                           Leonof</a>  even used puppet to make them think that people still lived there.  seeing as Leonof made his entrance, Wolfwood was outraged by his method  of dealing with enemies, and tried to shoot him, unfortunately Leonof  used his Oonica puppet as a shield. Leonof then tried to attack him but  failed because of Vash's fury. <a href=\"///\">                                          Gray the  Ninelives</a> then popped out of the ground, in an effort  to kill Wolfwood. After numerous attempts on Gray's behalf to crush him with his hands, Wolfwood managed each time to escape using his mind and the machine gun in his cross. The battle ground moved farther and farther from the place it began, as  they left both Leonof and Vash battle one another. Nicholas battle with Gray lasted very long, he tried everything with Gray, he blew up one of Gray's projectiles, he ripped his arm of, he opened him up with his cannon and machine gun. Nicholas killed 7 of Gray's drivers, as the remaining two tried using the body to kill him, Millie and Meryl stepped in and saved him. He wakes up in a hospital apparently saved by a few friends of Vash. <br/> <h2>Bottom of the Dark</h2>After this both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\" href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" slug=\"vash-the-stampede\">                         Vash </a>and Wolfwood left, but they fainted because of their trip, they find themselves in a hospital, then they live only to find out a few hours later that Meryl was kidnapped by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\">                       Gung Ho Guns</a>. The two along with Millie went after them, Wolfwood was a little unhappy when he saw that Millie was coming with them, but Vash convinced him it was for the better. Nicholas then went catatonic when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67733\" href=\"/midvalley-the-hornfreak/4005-67733/\" slug=\"midvalley-the-hornfreak\">                        Midvalley </a>used his \"Ultra Shock Sonic Web\" to on him. But when he woke up, Nicholas used his rocket launcher and nearly burned all of Midvalley's face with a rocket. During one of Wolfwood's attack, Midvalley managed to counter it and Nicholas found himself fainted again, luckily Millie was there to help him up. He told her that he was right about not bringing her along and he send her after Meryl. Wolfwood was blinded as Midvalley had found him and was prepared to attack once more, but as Midvalley prepares his attack he manages to reach Midvalley and is ready to finish him, the battle is postponed after Millie steps in and the building blows up  do to a few bombs set up by Hoppered. As Midvalley tries to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67730\" href=\"/hoppered-the-gauntlet/4005-67730/\" slug=\"hoppered-the-gauntlet\">                          Hoppered </a>he is stopped by Wolfwood, the two  finally seemed to have ended the battles, but are interrupted by Legato,  who kills a renegade Midvalley using Hoppered's hand and gun. He is later shoot by Zazie, is saved by none other than <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67736\" href=\"/elendira-the-crimsonnail/4005-67736/\" slug=\"elendira-the-crimsonnail\">                           Elendira the Crimsonnail</a>, the 13th Gung Ho Guns, he is later treated and putted to work along with Vash, because their battles destroyed half the city. Wolfwood and Vash then decided to take a little break, in a town nearby, but the town faced a gang of robbers and Vash decided to stop them and he did, with Wolfwood's cross, then Wolfwood had a little discussion with Meryl. <br/> <br/><h2>Cross X</h2>Wolfwood and Vash find themselves in a new town, and they are attacked, the reason was a simple one, someone putted a new ounty on Vash's head, this one a lot smaller, but big enough to attract a few bonty hunters, they are quickly defeated by Vash and Wolfwood, but unfortunately one of them shoots at Vash and he cant deflect the shoot, it nearly hit's him until his Angel Arm steps in and catches the bullets, then the crowd goes wild and Vash and Wolfwood run, to avoid any other trouble. The two stopped in a town to save two guys that were sentenced to death, they stopped the execution and has a thanks they were rewarded with drinks, but unfortunately they couldn't stay and chat, because they too witnessed Knives's power up and continued their journey. <br/>The finally reached Knives's hideout, they were greeted by Elendira, who only allowed Vash to go in, Wolfwood was to stay outside with Elendira, but they weren't the only ones there <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67737\" href=\"/livio-the-double-fang/4005-67737/\" slug=\"livio-the-double-fang\">                    Livio </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67734\" href=\"/chapel-the-evergreen/4005-67734/\" slug=\"chapel-the-evergreen\">                   Chapel </a>made their entrenches, a lot of threats were thrown there but the three gunman are quickly calmed by Elendira. The two left, but not after threatening Wolfwood.  <br/>When Vash was captured by Knives, Wolfwood joined Livio and Chapel and started following the ship Vash was in, they come across a group of sheriffs that were trying to stop Knives's ship, Wolfwood tries to stop them without killing them, but he is criticized for that, by Chapel, in the end Livio kills them all. Wolfwood the goes after Vash, he uses a fake missile as a detraction, which is taken down by Elendira, he goes after Vash, he has a little battle with Legate, he finds out that Legato has been spending the last half a year trying to keep Vash down, both men get shot in the process. He then confronts Livio and Chapel, he is easily defeated, but Vash steps in and saves him with his Angel Arm.  <br/><h2>The Return</h2>Wolfwood would return to the orphanage he was raised in, to rescue a few kids and the caretaker who were taken hostage by Chapel and Livio, clearly a trap, Wolfwood had no choice, but to take the bait. After Livio killed one of the cyborgs for trying to kill a boy, Wolfwood steps in and takes out the entire gang, but he doesn't kill a single one of them. One of them even tries to destroy the orphanage with a rocket, but Livio catches and sends it back to him, killing him, when Wolfwood sees this he says to Livio that it wasn't necessary to kill him, he could have shot the rocket in midair. Chapel is disgusted when sees that Wolfwood hasn't killed a single cyborg. The battle between Livio and Wolfwood begins, after a few minutes Wolfwood is nearly killed by Livio, but he heals rapidly due to a serum he takes and continues the battle. He later launches a grenade in the sky, in order to hit Livio in the back. Moments later he defeats Chapel, in just a few seconds, but his happiness is cut short when sees the three Eye of Michael soldiers caring 3 Punishers, in moments the three go to Livio, only Livio wasn't home at the moment but Razlo was, he was the one using those Punisher crosses. After he sees how easily Razlo killed his henchmen, Wolfwood tries to take down Razlo, but he can barely make a move, he is brought down that quick, as Chapel tries to explain to him how he lost his legs because of Wolfwood, he is stopped when Wolfwood rise up, after remembering Vash way, later on he is stabbed by Chapel with his cross. Has Chapel tries to shoot him, Wolfwood drinks two batches of serun, he then breaks Chapels neck, enraged by this Razlo tries to kill him and Vash, Wolfwood decides to take him out by himself, he launches a rocket straight in Razlo's metallic hand, breaking it, he then uses the bullets fom his machine gun as a chain and shoots on of them a chain reaction is made, blowing all the skin on Razlo. He dies while sitting with Vash on a sofa, Vash then uses his Angel Arm, he buries Wolfwood's body, and putts his Punisher as a tombstone.<br/> <br/><h2>Anime version</h2>The anime version of Wolfwood is nearly identical to the one in the manga, he is raised by Chapel, and is killed by Chapel who is manipulated by Legato, he dies in a church, but before his battle with Chapel he spends a night with Millie, in the same bed.<br/><h2>Powers and abilities</h2>Wolfwood is one of the best gunman on Gunsmoke, he hold his Punisher Cross, a cross that is both machine gun and rocket launcher, it can be used as a shield or simply as a holder of many mini guns. Wolfwood is often seen keeping mini guns in it, he holds it wrapped up in sheets with belts. Among being a excellent gunman, he has automated healing, godlike sensory abilities, a body like steel and advance muscular mass, all due to experiments performed on him by the Eye of Michael. The only downfall to all these abilities is the fact that he ages quicker than a normal person.",

    "deck": "The long lost member of the Gung Ho Guns. Elendira the Crimsonnail appears only in the Trigun manga.  Although extremely feminine in appearance, Elendira is actually a male.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Not much is known about Elendira's past, except for the fact that he accompanied Knives and Legato, since he was a young boy, he is called the thirteenth Gung Ho Guns member, the strongest of them all. He is very loyal to Knives and is also very jealous of Legato.<br/><h2>Bottom of the Dark</h2> Elendira first appeared when he had a little chat on a phone, he had a little talk with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58338\" href=\"/millions-knives/4005-58338/\" slug=\"millions-knives\">                        Knives</a>, about <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40857\" href=\"/vash-the-stampede/4005-40857/\" slug=\"vash-the-stampede\">                   Vash</a> and he began to wonder if Knives was jealous of Vash, saying that he could hear it in the way Knives speaks. He also noted that the Gung Ho Guns had become smaller and that he will take care of Vash. Apparently  Knives didn't want Vash killed or for him to kill everyone using his Angel Arm, Elendira then jumped in and with little effort stopped <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\" href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" slug=\"legato-bluesummers\">                  Legato</a>, he was quickly recognized by Wolfwood, who called Elendira the Crimsonnail the most powerful of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\" href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" slug=\"gung-ho-guns\">                 Gung Ho Guns</a>. Elendira then takes Legato and lives. <br/><h2>Cross X</h2>Elendira and Legato talked about what Legato's purpose was, and about the two new members of the Gung Ho Guns,<a data-ref-id=\"4005-67734\" href=\"/chapel-the-evergreen/4005-67734/\" slug=\"chapel-the-evergreen\">                     Chapel the Evergreen </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67737\" href=\"/livio-the-double-fang/4005-67737/\" slug=\"livio-the-double-fang\">                Livio the Double Fang</a>, when they arrived they brought two intruders and a army of members Eye of Michael organization. Elendira then accompanied Knives and the doctor that healed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58338\" href=\"/millions-knives/4005-58338/\" slug=\"millions-knives\">         Knives</a>, to the plant that was on the central ship, unfortunately they were disturbed by a scientist, but when the plant died, Knives went very mad, he killed the scientist and when he was told that he and Vash were also dying he killed the doctor. Moments later he, Legato, Chapel and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67736\" href=\"/elendira-the-crimsonnail/4005-67736/\" slug=\"elendira-the-crimsonnail\"> </a>Livio witnessed Knives's ability to absorb other plants, after that Elendira said that he doesn't know if anyone will survive what Knives had in stored for everyone. When Vash and Wolfwood, Elendira greeted them, but only let Vash go see Knives, stood with Wolfwood outside, Livio and Chapel the came and tried to fight Wolfwood, but they were calmed down by Elendira who said that he would kill them all if the didn't stopped. The two left, but not before threatening Wolfwood a little. During the battle between Vash and Knives, Legato came to Elendira demanding that he stopped the battle but he didn't listen, so Legato left to save Knives alone. Elendira, Knives and Legato took Vash prisoner and took him for a little ride on the original ship. After Vash's escape he tried to stop Knives from following Vash, but failed. <br/><h2>Zero Hour</h2>He is later seen on Knives's Ark, where he tries to kill Legato, he then has a little chat with Zazie about how Livio and Razlo joined forces Vash the Stampede, and about Zazie's plants for coexisting with humans or plants. He is take down with ease by Zazie's worms. As soon as Knives destroys Zazie, Elendira attacks Livio, he sends his nails in Livio's stomach, thinking that Livio is dead, Elendira orders the kids that Livio was protecting that they should bury his body, but Livio was not finished and goes after Elendira, soon Elendira finds him. <br/><h2>Double Duel</h2>During the duel between Livio and Elendira, Elendira decided to change  clothes, he took of his jacket, only to show a type of armor beneath,  one that would increase his strength and speed. From what Elendira said,  when he impaled Livio the second time, he was the third man he had to  remove his restrain armor, in order to defeat. But Elendira didn't  killed Livio, he just made Razlon come out and play, he was quicker and  stronger than Livio, but Razlo wouldn't last long against Elendira.  Elendira would launch from his armor thousands of nails that crushed  Razlo's body, Elendira then ripped his head of and through it to the  side. But they were still breathing, Razlo and Livio teamed up against  Elendira, Elendira is later impaled by Livio, who uses the last tube of  serum to heal himself, when he was held down by Elendira. He then  impales Elendira, with one of his own nails. The battle was finally  over, Livio had won and Elendira had lost. Elendira's dead body is later used by Legato to threaten Vash in killing Livio, Legato is killed moments later by Vash.  <br/><h2>Powers and abilities </h2>Elendira the Crimsonnail, the Lost Number Thirteen as Wolfwood called him, is considered the most powerful of the Gung Ho Guns, he uses the briefcase as a crossbow that shots giant nails, instead of arrows. He also has a restriction armor, he fought with it disabled only three, by disabling it he increases his speed and strength many times.",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Livio met <a href=\"/nicholas-d-wolfwood/4005-67735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67735\">Wolfwood </a>when they were growing up at the orphanage. Wolfwood came to Livio and asked him why was he so shy, but Livio didn't tell. With Wolfwood insisting more and more, the two finally became friends, but they became best friends after a incident at the orphanage. A small girl named Jasmine followed a dog on a rooftop, but she got scared and couldn't get down, Wolfwood tried to save her but failed when she fell off the roof and hurtled to the ground. Livio stepped in though and caught her, after which he and Wolfwood became very good friends. Later that same night, the dog was killed. Wolfwood, who was helping another kid go to the bathroom, saw Livio that night with a very fearsome expression on his face. When Livio woke up the next day, he had his hands covered in blood. Although others accused him of killing that dog, the caretaker of the orphanage found him innocent. Later that day Livio disappeared.</p><p>Months later, he found himself wandering in a no-name town. Due to exhaustion he tripped, and when he searched his pocket he found a piece of paper with the name \"Razlo\" written on it. He didn't know where it came from or from who, but he was too tired to pay much attention to it. Later some unsavory locals try to run him out of town. After getting beaten by them, he found another note, with written on it: \"Kill those bastards, I'm really looking forward to it. Razlo.\" The letters continued to come, and he slowly started to give in more and more. A few weeks later he saw the men who'd beaten him. They immediately began beating him again, but then minutes later they hear a voice, the voice of Razlo. Razlo took control of Livio and killed the men in mere seconds, then told Livio that this was a way to punish him for forgetting he existed. Razlo then took Livio to a place where they were needed, the organization known as the Eye of Michael where both of them would be trained to become assassins.</p><p>Livio quickly rose through the ranks and soon became considered among the best assassins the Eye of Michael organization had ever made. He, <a href=\"/\">Chapel the Evergreen, </a>and his old friend Nicholas D. Wolfwood (who also joined the Eye of Michael) are considered to be three of the best. Although he looks like a adult, his age was enhanced due to experiments performed on him by the Eye of Michael to maximize his genetic potential. It seems that at some point in the past, Wolfwood grew fearful of Livio and tried to kill him. Wolfwood failed however, and he and Livio quickly became bitter enemies afterwards.</p><p>During his training with Chapel, Razlo killed nine of the best men of the Eye of Michael, and as punishment he was to be killed, but Chapel stepped in and shot himself for Razlo's crimes, begging the organization's council to let him live, because he had great value. This event made both Livio and Razlo come to greatly revere Chapel, and they became his most devout follower.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Cross X</h3><p>Livio and Chapel are invited to be members of the <a href=\"/gung-ho-guns/4060-57146/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57146\">Gung Ho Guns</a>, during their trip Livio finds two intruder and he quickly takes care of them, without any effort, the two were riding a bike, two gunman that killed the group that were guarding the fortress in seconds, but Livio brakes both their necks in even less time, while the two were riding in a tunnel, Livio grabs the one in the front the one that had 150 kg and then breaks the neck of the other one, outside the tunnel, when he starts screaming ogre. Livio then brings them to <a href=\"/legato-bluesummers/4005-67723/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67723\">Legato </a>as proof of his power. Livio is the only Gung Ho Guns with two coins, he was given one for himself and one for Razlo, his other personality. Moments later he, Legato, Chapel and <a href=\"/elendira-the-crimsonnail/4005-67736/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67736\">Elendira </a>witnessed Knives's ability to absorb other plants. Later when Wolfwood and Vash arrive to their hiding place, he and Chapel try to attack Wolfwood but are stopped by Elendira. He left with Chapel and Wolfwood shortly after the others left with Vash, following their ship, the three encountered a group of sheriffs, Wolfwood tried disarming them without killing them, but Livio stepped in and killed everyone of them, while Wolfwood got criticized by Chapel for not killing them. After Wolfwood once again betrays the Gung Ho Guns, and goes after Vash, when he escapes, Livio and Chapel, confront him and take him down, but Vash steps in and saves him with his Angel Arm.</p><h3>The Return</h3><p>Livio finally returned to the orphanage were he spent so little time, this time with Chapel and a few goons that were killed by Livio, who didn't see necessary for them to be there, since he and Chapel were more than enough. They took the caretaker and a few kids hostage and were going to use them as bait, to lure Wolfwood and they succeed, Wolfwood comes running. After Wolfwood defeated the gang, one of them tried to destroy the orphanage using a rocket, big mistake, as soon as the rocket was in the air, Livio caught it with his bare hands and send it back towards her owner, killing him in the process. The battle between the two began as soon as Livio was done talking about meeting Ranzo, during the begging of the battle, Livio is shot in the face, multiple times. But he quickly rises up and begins to shoot Wolfwood with his back turned at him. He is then tricked by Wolfwood who trows one of his own rockets into the sky, to hit Livio from behind. Moments later he would rise again, but not as Livio, as Razlo, the three Eye of Michael soldiers go to him and give him the three Punisher crosses, he even catches one of Wolfwood's bullets with his third hand. Razlo, decapitates one of the three soldiers with his crosses and turns him into pieces with his bullets. Wolfwood is defeated easily by Razlo, using both his built in machine guns and his cannons, Razlo even laughs in Nicholas and Chapel's faces. When Wolfwood was receiving his lecture from Chapel, Razlo steps in trying to calm Chapel down, but Chapel shoots Wolfwood and then stabs him. He and Chapel try to kill the orphans and the caretaker, but every single bullet is stopped by Vash. When Wolfwood breaks Chapel's neck, Razlo begins to cry and attacks Vash and Wolfwood with all he's got. The other two Eye of Micheal soldiers attack, the battle between Wolfwood and Razlo is epic, Wolfwood uses his rocket launcher to blow up Razlo's third metallic hand, Wolfwood then chains him with his bullets and shoots one of the bullets, causing a chain reaction that destroys all of Razlo's skin. He then gives the order to his two soldiers to help him, but Vash stops them, he then tries to kill Nicholas but is stopped by Livio, Wolfwood grabs him and the sharp part of Chapel's cross impales Wolfwood in the shoulder, seeing this Razlo begins to think Chapel was aiming for him, not Wolfwood, Razlo then uses his machine gun and kills Chapel. After the Wolfwood is buried by Vash, Livio and Vash have a little bite to eat, and try to remember their best moments with Wolfwood, they put Wolfwood's Punisher cross as a tombstone.</p><h3>Zero Hour</h3><p>Livio then left went Vash, to stop Knives who was attempting to free all the plants that were under human domination. Livio and Vash mange to reach Meryl and Millie, when Millie asks where Wolfwood is, Brad tells he that he went on a journey and that he might never return. Livio later thanks Brad, Brad then suggests that Livio helps Vash in the battle ahead, now that Wolfwood is dead. He is later confronted by Elendira, he loses the battle but he doesn't die, as Elendira thought, he saves a few kids during that battle, Jasmine (the girl Livio saved when he was a kid) comes and thanks him for taking care of the orphans she was taking care of, she gives him a scarf and one of the kids gives Livio his mariachi hat, he then goes after Elendira. During the battle between Vash and Knives, Livio steps in and saves Meryl and Millie, he beats an entire army seconds later, later on Livio reaches Elendira.</p><h3>Double Duel</h3><p>During the duel between Livio and Elendira, Elendira decided to change clothes, he took of his jacket, only to show a type of armor beneath, one that would increase his strength and speed. From what Elendira said, when he impaled Livio the second time, he was the third man he had to remove his restrain armor, in order to defeat. But Elendira didn't killed Livio, he just made Razlon come out and play, he was quicker and stronger than Livio, but Razlo wouldn't last long against Elendira. Elendira would launch from his armor thousands of nails that crushed Razlo's body, Elendira then ripped his head of and through it to the side. But they were still breathing, Razlo and Livio teamed up against Elendira, Elendira is later impaled by Livio, who uses the last tube of serum to heal himself, when he was held down by Elendira. He then impales Elendira, with one of his own nails. The battle was finally over, Livio had won and Elendira had lost. He is then used by Legato, along with Elendira's body as a bargeting chip, in order for Legato to die.</p><p>During the final battle between Vash and Knives, one member of the human fleet stepped in and tried to kill Knives, but hit Vash instead, Livio then jumped in and stopped her from attacking once more, Vash then took Knives into the sunset. Livio continued his life at the orphanage he and Wolfwood met, he is the only Gung Ho Guns along with two of the pilots of <a href=\"/gray-the-ninelives/4005-67729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67729\">Gray the Ninelives</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Like all members of the Eye of Michael, Livio was given a serum that would give him a body like steel and advanced muscular mass, god-like sensory abilities, as well as borderline immortality. Livio can survive virtually any injury, even if someone shattered his skull into pieces. His marksmanship has been enhanced at such a level that he doesn't even need to look at a target to hit it. He can fire two machine guns at the same time with great expertise, and even three Punisher Crosses simultaneously. In addition to these abilities he has a third arm, a robotic one, which he uses to wield his third Punisher Cross. Only as Razlo does he wield three Punisher Crosses though. Razlo is also much more vicious than Livio, charging recklessly into battle, shooting wildly, and caring little for how injured he gets. Despite this recklessness though, Razlo is even more skilled and dangerous than Livio is.</p>",

Her mother ended up killing herself because of those voices. But Danny being weak as he was, listened them and followed where the voices lead. He ended up with a box in his hands, and in that box was a mask, that transformed him into bird-headed half-god that was his birthright. He received incredible power and could now fly.

    "deck": "Skipper Von Richthofen \"Skippy\" Is the Premier Ace Pilot of the criminal organization Night Flight, Under the command of Dark Bird. She is at LEAST the Equal of Pilot Kevin \"Ace\" Koss and has an extremely strong crush on him .",
    "description": "<h2>History<br/></h2>A graduate of the German Navel academy at sixteen years of age, \"Skippy\" as she is known in Night flight, is a military genius who when pushed in the direction of a desk job in the German high command, (Instead of what she wanted to do - FLY),  decided it was not for her went - A.W.O.L. and Joined Night flight - a mercenary criminal organization who flies for the highest bidder. <br/>   <h2>Genius</h2> <p>Able to speak four languages fluently, (two known - English and German.), she had graduated from the academy with the highest honors possible.    <br/>     Based on \"feats\" she has thought circles around almost everyone who she comes up against, laying plans and getting results in regards to anything she wants.  On three separate occasions she has maneuvered her organization that she belonged to into a position to scoop up Kevin Koss without the the leader of Night flight catching on until after the fact.   In two of those situations she candidly let Kevin Koss know that not only had she orchestrated these events but she had also figured out how  Kevin would get away, then did nothing to stop him AFTER telling him why he was caught in the first place.<br/>          Speaking on “Feats”   She is the only person shown in the Gold Digger Universe who can hold her own against Kevin \"Ace\" Koss in fighter craft. </p> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1737019-c35_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1737019\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.826\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:82.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1737019-c35_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1737019\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55253/1737019-c35_3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1737019-c35_3.jpg 500w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55253/1737019-c35_3.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption> </figcaption></figure> <p>She has shown a complete understanding of physics in regards to flight and all things avionic, Able to do amazing things when piloting that others would be hard pressed to duplicate. She has destroyed runways in one pass using minimal weaponry, flown / fought in an unknown number of craft as an expert and even in the rare time she loses has come out unscathed.  </p> <h2>Personal </h2> <p>1.          Friends - None reported as of this writing but she has many who know and respect her - and act like her friends to keep her centered as the premier Ace  of Night Flight. Her \"Boss\" Dark Bird, ( Roxy Rabinowitz ) has made it a point to try to keep \"Skippy\" happy and offer her everything she could want  - which explains her lack of anger in regards to being manipulated into catching Kevin Koss more than once. Everyone else seems to treat her with kit gloves even though she is shown to be anything but fragile.   <br/> <br/>2.         Romance – Even though Dark Bird has thrown many a pilot in Night flight at Skippy, Skipper only wants one man, Kevin Koss.  She believed at one point that the only way to prove that they were made for each other was to beat him in air combat.  Currently  she is using trickery, guile, and death threats against innocents to force Kevin to come to her.<br/></p> <p>3.         Personality – Most of the time Skippy   emotes a bubbling empty-headed blond facade that completely disguises the genius within, possibly a coping mechanism to allow her to be perceived as \"normal\" to most around her.  <br/>     The Brilliant military tactician only comes out as needed when flying a jet or planning an offensive in regards to what she wants.   <br/>     She appears to be inherently of good nature and a strong sense of right and wrong, even though she belongs to a criminal organization.  <br/>    She is currently focused on two things, Flying and Kevin Koss.  <br/></p> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1097332-marry_or_else.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1097332\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"3.1666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:316.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1097332-marry_or_else.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1097332\"><img alt=\"Marry me or else,...\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1097332-marry_or_else.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1097332-marry_or_else.jpg 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\"></a><figcaption>Marry me or else,...</figcaption></figure> <p>Skippy is a person who is not above killing to get what she wants.  <br/>      As of this writing the situation has come to a head.  She had forced Ace to give his word to marry her by threatening to kill hostages of a failed attempt to take over Nightflights flying fortress the Gull Wing. Penny Pincher challenged Skippy to an Dog fight for Kevin Koss. Whomever lost  would \"ditch\" Kevin and move on. Skippy accepted,.. and it would have been an easy win for her - except she had to break off to defend the Gull Wing, and it cost her her plane and the match against Penny, (Who got a free pass from night flight for assisting in the rescue of the Gull Wing.) Currently Skippy is leaving  Ace to Penny in the belief that Penny does love Ace.</p>",
