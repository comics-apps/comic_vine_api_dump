Kamea receives a vision that  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45873\" href=\"/malikai/4005-45873/\" slug=\"malikai\">    Malikai</a> and his group, including the fairy named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42967\" href=\"/grace/4005-42967/\" slug=\"grace\">      Grace</a>, will soon come to visit them in order to receive teachings in the ways of ancient magic. Pili greets the group when they arrive and shows <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45873\" href=\"/malikai/4005-45873/\" slug=\"malikai\">   Malikai</a> the way to her father so that he can begin his lessons. When the group leaves, Pili warns <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45856\" href=\"/pj/4005-45856/\" slug=\"pj\">  P.J.</a> that a vision has shown her that death will come to a member of their group of adventures, should they continue on their adventure. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45856\" href=\"/pj/4005-45856/\" slug=\"pj\"> P.J., </a>however, disregards her warning and the group soon sets sail. Pili next goes to her father in hopes of convincing him to leave the island for she has seen his death as well. When he refuses, she runs off, not wishing to witness his death for a second time.<br/><br/><h2>Power</h2>Pili has inherited her father's precognitive abilities. She may know some magical skills since her father is one of the Ancient masters of magic, however she does not display any such power. However, she does seem to be aware of how and why magic works.",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2> <p>David Xanatos was born in Maine to a local fisherman <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45838\" href=\"/petros-xanatos/4005-45838/\" slug=\"petros-xanatos\"> Petros Xanatos</a>. A stranger gave David a rare coin one day which he was able to sell for 20,000 dollars. Xanatos was on his way to amassing his fortune. Xanatos was unaware at the time that the stranger who gave him that coin was a member of the Illuminati, Xanatos has since become a member.</p> <p>Xanatos poached two very useful allies off <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46017\" href=\"/halcyon-renard/4005-46017/\" slug=\"halcyon-renard\"> Halcyon Renard</a>, in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45917\" href=\"/puck/4005-45917/\" slug=\"puck\"> Owen Burnett </a>(Secretly Puck) and the scientist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45995\" href=\"/sevarius/4005-45995/\" slug=\"sevarius\"> Sevarius</a>. He also met Halcyon's daughter Fox who he would later marry. Owen Burnett later revealed he was Puck and offered Xanatos one wish from Puck or lifelong service from Owen Burnett. This impressed the immortal Puck immensely and Puck had such respect for Xanatos, that he would even stand against his own king for Xanatos at a later date.</p> <p>Between 1975 and 1994, Xanatos entered into an alliance with<a data-ref-id=\"4005-41538\" href=\"/demona/4005-41538/\" slug=\"demona\">  Demona </a>due to the machinations of a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55712\" href=\"/time-travel/4015-55712/\" slug=\"time-travel\"> time traveling </a>Finella, Mary and<a data-ref-id=\"4005-41543\" href=\"/brooklyn/4005-41543/\" slug=\"brooklyn\">  Brooklyn</a>. Xanatos raised Castle Wyvern atop the Eyrie Building and awoke the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41536\" href=\"/gargoyles/4060-41536/\" slug=\"gargoyles\"> Gargoyles</a> from their curse. Xanatos attempted to manipulate the Gargoyles into stealing for him but was stopped by<a data-ref-id=\"4005-41537\" href=\"/elisa-maza/4005-41537/\" slug=\"elisa-maza\">  Elisa Maza</a>. The Gargoyles fought Xanatos and his Steel Clan Robots and defeated him. Xanatos was forced to go to jail for receiving stolen property from the thefts he had the Gargoyles carry out before he was caught.</p> <p>After failing to bend the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45781\" href=\"/the-manhattan-clan/4060-45781/\" slug=\"the-manhattan-clan\"> Manhattan Clan </a>to his will, Xanatos attempted to create his Gargoyles through cloning and genetic engineering. He got Sevarius to first create the<a data-ref-id=\"4060-45942\" href=\"/the-mutates/4060-45942/\" slug=\"the-mutates\">  Mutates</a>. The Mutates were a group of humans whose dna was spliced with that of animal dna to create Gargoyle-like creatures. The Mutates rebelled against Xanatos and became allies of the Manhattan Clan.</p> <p>He later attempted to clone Goliath. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45779\" href=\"/thailog/4005-45779/\" slug=\"thailog\"> Thailog</a> was created and was programmed to think just like Xanatos. This backfired and Thailog attempted to kill Xanatos, Goliath and Sevarius, if it wasn't for Elisa Maza he might have died.</p> <p>Right after this incident Fox and Xanatos met each other again. They departed on a whirlwind romance and the quickly married. Xanatos gave Fox part of the Eye of Odin as an engagement gift. The Eye of Odin transformed Fox into a<a data-ref-id=\"4015-55754\" href=\"/werewolves/4015-55754/\" slug=\"werewolves\">  werewolf </a>luckily Goliath intervened and saved Fox. Xanatos invited Goliath to his wedding supposedly in gratitude. What Xanatos actually wanted was the part of the Phoenix Gate that Goliath had and when Demona arrived to the wedding with her half Xanatos teleported himself, Goliath, Demona, Fox and his father back in time to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55911\" href=\"/scotland/4020-55911/\" slug=\"scotland\"> Scotland</a> in the year 975.</p> <p>While in the past Xanatos saved <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46015\" href=\"/princess-elena/4005-46015/\" slug=\"princess-elena\"> Princess Elena </a>and<a data-ref-id=\"4005-25825\" href=\"/strafe/4005-25825/\" slug=\"strafe\">  King Malcolm </a>from bandits to which he was rewarded some old coins. Xanatos sent one of the coins to the Illuminati Society with instructions to send the coin to him in 1975 and establish his wealth.</p> <p>Demona and Xanatos's alliance ended when she cursed everyone in Manhattan and turned them permanently to stone. Xanatos was forced to ally with Goliath to stop her. The alliance was temporary however and in later months Xanatos continued to move against the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45781\" href=\"/the-manhattan-clan/4060-45781/\" slug=\"the-manhattan-clan\"> Manhattan Clan</a>.</p> <p>This all changed after the birth of Xanatos son Alexander. Fox was the daughter of Anastasia Renard an alias of Titania Queen of the third race. Titania wanted the child (At least thats what she made everyone think.) and enlisted Oberon to claim him for her. The Gargoyles, Halcyon Renard and Puck all attempted to protect Alexander from Oberon but failed and Oberon defeated all of there defenses When Oberon was about to claim Alexander Fox let loose a magic blast. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41535\" href=\"/goliath/4005-41535/\" slug=\"goliath\"> Goliath</a> used this to prove that Alexander could stay with his parents and not lose his magical potential as Fox had never learned of hers and just tapped into it. Goliath suggested that Puck could teach Alexander in the use of his magical powers and Oberon and Titania agreed. Xanatos was truly grateful for this and promised to do anything he could to repay them.</p> <p>Xanatos was true to his word over the coming months he created new bodies for Coldfire and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45791\" href=\"/coldsteel/4005-45791/\" slug=\"coldsteel\"> Coldsteel</a> and when the Gargoyles existence was revealed to the public he offered his home and protection to them. <br/> <br/></p><h2>Abilities<br/></h2>Xanatos is the richest man in the Gargoyles Universe. He has the resources to accomplish almost all that he wishes. He is a very smart man, able to manipulate those around him to do what he wants. He is also skilled at martial arts. He is a strong leader, able to command his company and many teams of evil doers.  <br/> <br/>Xanatos uses a power suit whenever he goes into battle. It looks like a robotic Goliath, which is fitting since it simulates all the abilities of a gargoyle. With it he can fly, shoot lasers, and resist damage from most forms of attack. It also gives him increased strength. With these abilities he is a match for most threats that face him.",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>His origin involves Eric as a baby rocketing from the moon to Earth. He gained his amazing powers from the crescent shaped moon which resembled a banana. In the 1991 <a href=\"../../the-dandy-book/49-22322/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dandy book</a> his origin was changed however when Eric gets his power as a baby from eating a Saturnium laced banana.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Bananaman first appeared in <a href=\"/nutty-/4000-229982/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-229982\">Nutty</a> <a href=\"/nutty-/4000-229982/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-229982\">No.1</a> on February 16th 1980 written by <a href=\"/steve-bright/4040-61387/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-61387\">Steve Bright</a> and drawn by <a href=\"/john-geering/4040-61329/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-61329\">John Geering</a> and published by <a href=\"/dc-thomson-co/4010-2333/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2333\">D.C. Thomson &amp; Co</a>. Bananaman became a regular character in <a href=\"/the-dandy/4050-26867/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26867\">The Dandy</a> after it merged with Nutty in 1985. In 2012, he started appearing in reprints in <a href=\"/the-beano/4050-26847/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26847\">The Beano</a>, while new stories continued in the Dandy. He's the only character ever to have an ongoing strip in both comics at the same time. The strip parodies the super-hero genre. After the Dandy's demise at the end of 2012, and the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-dandy/4050-62606/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-62606\">digital Dandy</a>'s quick failure in 2013, Bananaman's run in The Beano switched to new stories, drawn by <a href=\"/wayne-thompson/4040-60562/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-60562\">Wayne Thompson</a> and written by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kevin-sutherland/4040-43189/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43189\">Kev F Sutherland</a> and <a href=\"/nigel-auchterlounie/4040-60537/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-60537\">Nigel Auchterlounie</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Eric Wimp seems to be an ordinary kid living at Acacia Avenue but whenever he eats a banana he becomes Bananaman. With a direct line to Eric's bananaphone, <a href=\"/chief-oreilly/4005-78415/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78415\">Chief O'Reilly</a> can call for the help of Bananaman (totally unaware that Eric is indeed Bananaman). Bananaman is a parody of <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>. He can boost his powers further by eating more bananas. He even has a <a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite</a>-like weakness to moldy bananas. Bananaman's trusted sidekick, <a href=\"/crow/4005-78409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78409\">Crow</a>, keeps him well supplied with fresh bananas whenever he needs them. Bananaman's similarities with Superman end there though since he is clumsy, bumbling and quite dim, often capturing the bad guy by accident.</p><p>The enemies of Bananaman continue the super-hero parody theme. His two main rivals are <a href=\"/general-blight/4005-78410/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78410\">General Blight</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-gloom/4005-78412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78412\">Doctor Gloom</a> (a parody of Hitler and Doctor Doom respectively). Other regular super-villians are Weather man, Skunk-woman (a homage to Catwoman), and Appleman who is a reference to Superman's <a href=\"/bizarro/4005-8312/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8312\">Bizarro</a> (being the opposite to Bananaman...).</p><p>After his transfer to the Dandy, Bananaman began a rivalry with Dandy's resident strongman, <a href=\"/desperate-dan/4005-21479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21479\">Desperate Dan</a>, even visiting Dan's home town (and comic strip) to challenge him to a fight.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6248/154163-50259-bananaman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-154163\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6248/154163-50259-bananaman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-154163\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6248/154163-50259-bananaman.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6248/154163-50259-bananaman.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></a></figure><p>The Bananaman cartoon ran from 1983-86 on the BBC and was aired in the United States on the Nickelodeon cable network. All the characters were voiced by <a href=\"/the-goodies/4060-59262/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59262\">the Goodies</a>.</p><p>The cartoon varied slightly from the comic strip with Eric Wimp now being known as Eric Twinge and Bananaman having a love interest. Some of the variations in the cartoon were adapted to the comic strip. Eric no longer had a skinhead and now had thick black hair with 2 banana shaped tuffs and Bananamans gloves changed from red to yellow.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mordechai was the son of famed Soviet Blood Specialist Dr. Emil Kovak and his patient, Latverian Translvanian Klara. Klara was suffering from a rare blood disease and right before she died, she gave birth to Mordechai during the Cold War.</p><p>At first Mordechai appeared as a normal baby, but later got the same blood disease as his mother. But it was even worst then his mother's condition. His whole physical appearance started to change into a skeletal form. He would soon go threw massive treatments by his father. As he hit he hit puberty, he started developing a number of lumps growing on his chest.</p><p>As he hit his teens he became frailer, and the lumps turned into tusks. The tusks turned out to be fangs. This was found out when Mordechai attack one of Emil assistants and impaled him with his spikes and drank the blood of the victim.</p><p>As Mordechai got older, his father built him a protective suit containing a chemical that bathed Mordechai at all times. As communist Russia fell, Mordechai and his father Emil moved to the United States where Emil can find a way to cure his son in a hidden lab in a subway.</p><p>One key plan that Emil wanted to do was to find Micheal Morbius while during the time he was still a human and a nobel winning scientist. However at this point <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6722\" href=\"/morbius/4005-6722/\" slug=\"morbius\">Morbius</a> became a living vampire. this was bad for Emil because Morbius was his last hope. As Mordechai's thirst increased, he was given the nickname Bloodbath by his father who he soon killed, escaped the lab, and started killing people in the subway. For a while he was given the role as the \"Subway Vampire Killer.\"</p><p>He later fought Morbius in the subway. Morbius almost lost to Bloodbath too. Morbius stopped Bloodbath by grabbing Bloodbath's wrist and smashing it into the head piece of Bloodbath's suit. As the chemicals drained from the suit, Bloodbath slowly passed away.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Bloodbath was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42317\" href=\"/mort-todd/4040-42317/\" slug=\"mort-todd\">Mort Todd</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-18557\" href=\"/rurik-tyler/4040-18557/\" slug=\"rurik-tyler\">Rurik Tyler</a> in 1993 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-9097\" href=\"/midnight-sons-unlimited/4050-9097/\" slug=\"midnight-sons-unlimited\">Midnight Sons Unlimited</a> # 2.</p>",

Dressing somewhat casual for a boy his age, Mal is also outfitted with several pieces of armor and gear for defensive and fighting purposes. His main weapons of choice are his digital, dragon-like talons that have a number of attributes for use in battle situations. Having four large bumps protruding from his back, Mal is currently in a cycle of his life prior to the emergence of his wings.</p><h2>Childhood</h2><p>Abandoned in an orphanage at birth by his parents, Mal spent a great deal of his childhood coming to terms with the world around him. He quickly developed a comedic attitude to cover up most of his emotions towards his absent parental figures. He also survived by finding solace in his friends <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45856\" href=\"/pj/4005-45856/\">      P.J. </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45857\" href=\"/sonia/4005-45857/\">     Sonia</a>.</p><h2>Grace</h2><p>Malikai's life changed dramatically when he encountered <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42967\" href=\"/grace/4005-42967/\">    Grace</a>, a mysterious woman with dragonfly wings.

    "deck": "The Comet was one of the first superheroes to die in a comic, is in the Public Domain.",
    "description": "<h2>Pep Comics</h2><p>In the early 1940’s, while working at his research lab in, Dickering discovers a gas that is “fifty times lighter than hydrogen.” Injecting it into his bloodstream, he finds that he can “make great leaps” through the air. He continues experimenting on himself until, after many injections, the gas accumulates in his eyes and causes them to throw off two powerful beams. When they cross, whatever he’s looking at will “disintegrate completely.”</p><p>Dubbing his power “dissolvo-vision,” he finds that the only problem is that can’t control it except by closing his eyes. Fortunately, Dickering’s vision can’t harm glass, so he makes a pair of goggles which he raises to release his blasts. Inspired by the exploits of other costumed heroes, he becomes the crime-fighting Comet. A hero, albeit an unorthodox one; he is one of the few who kills his adversaries. Though his girlfriend-reporter Thelma Gordon writes him up as a hero, his thirst for blood makes the public uneasy.</p><p>Not so the aliens of the planer Altrox who, after studying his adventures on earth, teleport him to their world to help Queen Naija wage war against invading robots. Barely surviving the encounter, the Comet is returned to earth where he is promptly shot dead by friends of gangster Big Boy Malone, whose gang he had previously busted.</p><p>Witnessing the tragedy, Queen Naija brings him back to Altrox, reviving and then marrying him. But bad luck continues to hound the Comet. Less than a week later, robot survivors of the Battle of Annexia ambush the newlyweds. By this time, the Altroxian atmosphere has deprived him of his dissolvo-vision, something the Comet is unaware of until he tries to use it against the assassins. The queen is killed.</p><p>Creating a super powered costume using Altroxian science, the Comet returns to earth, after spending the equivalent of several earth-decades on Altrox, only to discover that Thelma has married his brother Bob, The Hangman. Recovering, the Comet moves in with The Shield, and resumes his super heroic career.</p><h2>Red Circle</h2><p>A 1983 retelling of the Comet’s origin blames his transformation on a lab accident in which Dickering, working with the unstable elements, inhales “the collective residue of a hundred different gases.” Likewise, the colors of the Comet’s Altroxian costume changed slightly without explanation. John Dickering was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31655\" href=\"/hangman/4005-31655/\">Hangman</a>'s brother and superhero himself.</p><h2>Impact Comics</h2><p>Rob Connors' parents were working in a laboratory in a remote part of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55827\" href=\"/alaska/4020-55827/\">Alaska.</a> Rob went to visit them, only to find the lab destroyed. Seeking to summon assistance, he trued to repair the lab's damaged radio antenna, but it collapsed on him. There was an explosion of light and energy, which somehow granted him superhuman powers. Returning to civilization, Rob became The Comet, a costumed hero.</p><p>It was later revealed that Rob's body was being held in stasis by some aliens, and that somehow he switched brains with one of the aliens, so he believed himself to be the actual Rob Connors, and didn't realize he was the alien until next to the last issue of the series...died as a villain in Crucible 6.</p><h2>DC comics Revival</h2><p>In this incarnation of the hero, the comet was first introduced in the Inferno back up feature of The Shield. He originally worked for General Latham as a deep cover agent working amidst Arvin Halliday's metahuman operatives. He pulled off the part and even acted as Halliday's bodyguard. He engaged The Inferno in a conflict in Halliday's company's headquarters and eventually become close friends with The Inferno (much to The Inferno's dismay). When Arvin Halliday was exposed as a Durlan agent, The Comet and Inferno showed their true colors and helped their fellow Mighty Crusaders in the attack on the headquarters.</p><p>He was sent on a mission to Japan (where he was often confused with another Japanese Hero) to find more Durlan agents and ran into The Fox. Eventually he and the Fox reunited with the other Crusaders and helped defend their headquarters from the amassed forces of both Durlan factions. He participated in the mission to secure the box and thus helped in defeating his former employer: Arvin Halliday. The Comet was last seen with the other Crusaders preparing for any threats in the future.</p>",

    "deck": "Moloch use to be a super-villain and a mob boss who clashed with various members of the Watchmen.",
    "description": "<p>Moloch was a crime boss in the 1940s through 1960s. He battles both Nite Owls ( <a data-ref-id=\"4005-60465\" href=\"/hollis-mason/4005-60465/\" slug=\"hollis-mason\">Hollis Mason</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43224\" href=\"/nite-owl/4005-43224/\" slug=\"nite-owl\">Daniel Dreiberg</a>), <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40527\" href=\"/dr-manhattan/4005-40527/\" slug=\"dr-manhattan\">Dr Manhattan</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43221\" href=\"/ozymandias/4005-43221/\" slug=\"ozymandias\">Ozymandias</a>. He then comitted crimes in less conspicous ways but still met defeat. He eventually gives up on crime. Moloch worked at Dimensional Developments (a company owned Veidt aka Ozymandias) where he was secretly bombarded with radiation to induce cancer as a part of a plan to exile Dr. Manhattan.</p><h2>Origins</h2><p>As explained in Before Watchmen, Moloch was born deformed and unloved by his parents or peers. He became obsessed with magic which allowed others to be entertained by him and ignore his deformity. Eventually he fell in love with a local girl, and after being tricked by her he killed her boyfriend, dumping the body on her bed and then he ran away from home. He became a stage magician but after a lack of success he turned to crime using his magic tricks to confuse police. He soon gained power and started his own criminal empire. When the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55987\" href=\"/minutemen/4060-55987/\" slug=\"minutemen\">MinuteMen</a> were formed he ended up clashing with them many times. His plans fell apart upon the appearance of Dr.Manhattan who's powers allowed him to easily defeat Moloch. Moloch repented after facing Dr.Manhattan's godly powers and eventually got a job working Ozymandias on a fake project.</p><h2>Final year</h2><p>The Comedian broke down in front of Moloch one night (while Moloch was in bed). He explained to Moloch what he knew about the conspiracy. However, due to his drunkeness, Moloch did not understand Blake's intention. This led to Blake's death as Vedit had bugged Moloch's appartment. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40444\" href=\"/rorschach/4005-40444/\" slug=\"rorschach\">Rorschach</a> ruthlessly interogated Moloch and found out about their meeting before Blake's death. Rorschach instructed him to leave a note at a certain location if he found out anything of importantance. Veidt ended up killing Moloch with a bullet to the head and framed Rorschach for the crime and was apprehended by police after briefly fighting the police force sent to arrest him.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>While he had no powers he was a ruthless criminal mastermind, effective planner and organizer. He also had a \"solar mirror weapon\" which the Minutemen had in their possession though how powerful the weapon was or if it even worked is unkown. He also carries a firearm hinting that he could be a good marksman however this can't be proven.</p><h2>Speculated inspiration</h2><p>The name Moloch comes from ancient Hebrew or Arabic and means either a god or a certain type of child sacrifice using fire. Moloch also appears in the Bible as a Prince of Hell, known for kidnapping children. It is possible, given the history of the name and Moloch's career as an owner of a vice den that Moloch was a sex offender or was involved in some way with the exploitation of children.

    "description": "<p>Puck was banished along with the rest of his race from Avalon for 1000 years to live and a mortal and hopefully learn to understand them.</p><p>This was successful for Puck and he developed an affinity for mortals particularly David Xanatos and his family. Puck encountered Anastasia Renard during the 1980s and was fascinated by the fact that the former Queen of the Third Race had married a mortal Puck took on the identity of Owen Burnett modeled after Preston Vogel an assistant of \"Anastasia's\" husband Halcyon Renard.</p><p>Puck got bored with moral Halcyon and entered the employ of David Xanatos. It was \"Owen\" who introduces Demona and Xanatos.</p><p>Later Demona unaware that Owen is Puck summons Puck with a magical artifact and causes havoc in New York City. Puck repeatedly misinterprets Demona's wishes just to annoy her. Puck has such a good time annoying Demona that he rewards her and give her the ability to become human in the day.</p><p>During the Cauldron of Life incident \"Owen\" hand was turned permanently to stone and Puck is forbidden from changing it back.</p><p>When the gathering was called Puck and all the other members of the Third Race were recalled to Avalon. Puck refused to go and hid in his identity of Owen Burnett. After the birth of Alexander Xanatos, Puck was one of the foremost defenders of Alexander Xanatos from Oberon. The battle for Alexander ended amicably but Puck was cursed to no longer be able to change between Puck and Owen Burnett. Puck was now Owen unless he was teaching Alexander then and only then could he become Puck and use magic again.</p>",

They are typically the leader of their respective teams, though their have been exceptions in several seasons such as Time Force.

He draws power from the Tyrannosaurus Power Coin.  He was a karate student with exceptional skill when Zordon summoned him and the four other original rangers to defend the planet against <a href=\"/rita-repulsa/4005-39640/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-39640\">Rita Repulsa</a> and her henchmen.  As the Red Power Ranger, Jason controlled the Tyrannosaurus Dinozord and later the Red Dragon Thunderzord. He also had temporary possession of the Dragonzord, along with the Dragon Power Coin, allowing him to utilize the Green Ranger's Dragon Shield and Dragon Dagger in battle.  He also carried the standard Blade Blaster, a laser pistol that could change into a short blade, and the Power Sword, the most powerful weapon this group of Rangers used. The Power Sword also formed the top of the Power Blaster, a powerful energy cannon formed through the combination of the core five Rangers' weapons.

The Power Sword also formed the top of the Combination blaster formed from the rest of the Rangers weapons.</p><h2>Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers</h2><p><b>Aurico</b></p><p>When the Rangers were de-aged during their search for the Zeo Crystal the Alien Rangers from Aquitar were called to serve as pinch hitters. Aurico is the informal leader and often gives the duties over to the White Alien Ranger. Aurico comes from a world almost completely underwater so his species is adept to live underwater. Aurico seems to have a level of super speed on par with the Ninja Rangers. When the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers returned the their natural ages Aurico and the other Alien Rangers departed though said that they would assist whenever needed.

as the lonely new kid, trying to fit in. His will, courage, loyalty as well as his determination and fighting spirit were strong leadership qualities he had that got him chosen by Gosei as the Megaforce Red Power Ranger and later became the Super Megaforce Red Power Ranger. He is willing to stand up for those who can't stand up for themselves, something he is greatly admired for. Troy passionately believes in mankind's potential for the better though he doesn't socialize much, believing in his duty of protecting the Earth from the the Warstar and the Armada as his number one priority. As the Megaforce Red Ranger, Troy wields the Dragon Sword and Mega Blasters in battle and pilots the Gosei Dragon Mechazord, assisted by Power Cards. He can also go Ultraforce to wield the Ultra Sword. As the Super Megaforce Red Ranger, he wields the Super Mega Blaster and Super Mega Saber and pilots the Super Mega Skyship Zord.</p><h2>Power Rangers: Dino Charge</h2>",

    "deck": "He was the one responsible for sealing the Nine-Tails inside Naruto, believing he would control it's power someday. He also learned the Rasengan, The Reaper Death Seal, and The Flying Thunder God Technique; the latter earning him the nickname \"The Yellow Flash of the Leaf.\" (Konoha's Yellow Flash). His full name is revealed to be Minato Namikaze and is also Naruto Uzumaki's father. He would later learn sealing techniques (fuinjutsu) of the Uzumaki clan from his wife, Kushina Uzumaki, who is Naruto's Mother.",
    "description": "<p>In Minato's Generation he was considered a genius.</p><p>The Fourth Hokage was well known as the greatest Hokage of all, already creating the A-Rank Rasengan and the S-Rank Flying Thunder God Technique before achieving the rank of Hokage.</p><p>He was taught by the Sannin <a href=\"/jiraiya/4005-44511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44511\">Jiraiya</a>. The two were very close and admired each other, Minato even named Naruto after an alias Jiraiya used for himself in his own autobiography, saying that he and <a href=\"/kushina-uzumaki/4005-50361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50361\">Kushina</a> wanted their son to be just like Jiraiya and they asked him to be Naruto's godfather. Minato would also teach his own group, composed of <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi Hatake</a>, <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\">Obito Uchiha</a>, and Rin.</p><p>When <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> became a Jonin (During the Third Shinobi World War, 13 years before the series began) Minato threw a celebration for his pupil. He gives <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> a special Kunai that he says should only be thrown in a case of emergency. <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\">Obito Uchiha</a> arrived at the celebrations late and without a gift, and he and <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> begin to argue. after their fight, Minato tells all of them of a mission to destroy a bridge in the Iwagakure region, therefore hurting their enemies economy.</p><p>As they moved through the enemy territory, it became apparent that they were being watched. <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> ran off stupidly to test out his new technique, but the enemy cloned himself and <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> began attacking blindly. A clone attacked <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\">Obito Uchiha</a>, who became paralyzed with fear, but he is saved by Minato. He then goes and saves <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> from a sword thrust from his enemy, while placing a teleportation seal on his foot. He gets everybody out of there. He then leaves <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a>, who was injured by the sword thrust, in the hands of Rin. Using the Flying Thunder God technique, he teleported behind the enemy they fought earlier. Realizing his opponent's power, the attacker give the regret of ignoring the order to flee at the sight of Minato before Minato kills him.</p><p>Minato returns to the place that he left his team, he tells <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> to not use Chidori, because it leaves him not enough sight to repel a counter attack. He then tells <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\">Obito Uchiha</a> not to speak without thinking.</p><p>That night, <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\">Obito Uchiha</a> comes to Minato and asks why <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> is the way he is. Minato tells him about <a href=\"/sakumo-hatake/4005-51478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51478\">Sakumo Hatake</a>, <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a>'s father. He was a famous and powerful ninja who was on par with the legendary Sannin. On a mission one day, Sakumo's team were capture, and instead of completing the mission, he went back and saved them. Because of this decision, Konoha suffered greatly and Sakumo was driven by this failure to kill himself. He then tells Obito that from that day forward, <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> adopted a strict mentality of always completing his mission, hiding his emotions and only focusing on the rules. Minato then asks <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\">Obito Uchiha</a> to try and understand <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a>.</p><p>The next day, Minato put everyone under the leadership of <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> while he went to the front of battle. When there, he gave soldiers dozens of Kunai with his teleportation seals and asked them to throw all of the kunai at their enemy, he then teleported to each kunai and single-handedly defeated the enemy army before they realized what was happening.</p><h2>Naruto Uzumaki</h2><p>Somewhere in his life Minato found time to have a baby. He and Kushina Uzumaki had the baby known Naruto Uzumaki. He was named after the heroic main character in one of Jiraiya's books.</p><p>Kushina was in reality the Kyuubi's host 16 years ago. Her pregnancy was attempted to be kept secret, and on the night of her birth, she was taken to a secret location guarded by a seal and some Anbu. <a href=\"/tobi/4005-45000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45000\">Madara</a> appeared, dispatched the Anbu and passed through the barrier. He knew that the seal containing the Kyuubi would weaken during labor and attempted to get the Kyuubi. He took baby Naruto and tried to bargain Naruto's life for the Kyuubi, he threw Naruto in the air and was about to stab him but Minato saved him only to realize that Madara placed explosive seals on Naruto's blanket and quickly got Naruto out of the blanket and fled from the hut which blew up, and Kushina was taken by Madara. Minato placed his Flying Thunder God on Kushina but didn't get there before the Kyuubi was released, Kushina however survived because of the Uzumakis' strong life force. Minato brought her back to their home with Naruto and went back to stop Madara.</p><p>Madara arrived at the edge of the Leaf village and summoned the Kyuubi there and it started going berserk. Minato appeared on the Hokage monument and transported the Kyuubi's chakra blast, Madara tried to sneak up on him but Minato reacted instantly and tried to stab Madara, but it passed through him and Madara tried to warp Minato away, but he teleported to safety. Madara followed after where he revealed long chains shackled to his wrists and charged at Minato, he went through Minato and wrapped Minato in the chains, but Minato teleported away. Madara and Minato then charged at each other again, this time Minato threw a kunai which went through Madara's face, but just as Madara grabbed Minato to warp him away, Minato teleported to the kunai he threw and slammed Madara from behind with a Rasengan.</p><p>Madara survived the Rasengan and leaped away, with his left arm injured. Unknown to him is that Minato placed a Flying Thunder God seal on his body and instantly stabbed him and placed another seal on Madara's body nullifying his control over the Kyuubi. Madara left promising that the Kyuubi will be his again, and that the world will bow to him. Minato raced back to Konoha in time to stall the Kyuubi from using a chakra blast by summoning Gamabunta to attack it, Minato then teleported it away to Kushina's and Naruto's location. Kushina used her chakra chains to bind the Kyuubi and wanted to drag it back into her and die, but Minato remembered Jiraiya's words about a destined child and a revolution, so Minato believed that Naruto would save the world from Madara and used the Reaper Death Seal to place half of the Kyuubi's chakra in Naruto and the other half in himself, and to seal a little bit of himself and Kushina in Naruto so that they could all see each other one day.</p><p>Minato placed a teleportation seal on Kushina. When Kushina was in danger Minato would appear ready to protect her.</p><h2>Powers/Techniques</h2><p>He created the \"Rasengan\" where he forms an intense ball of drilling chakra in the palm of the hand; this technique is actually incomplete since he intended on fusing his own elemental affinity with it before he died. \"Flying Thunder God\" were he throws a kunai with a seal on the handle, he is then able to instantly appear wherever the kunai is. He's also capable of placing these seals not just on kunais but on other items and living beings, allowing him to teleport wherever that seal was placed. \"Reaper Death Seal\" where he summons the Japanese Death god, which in return for user's life, would steal the opponent's soul. And an unnamed time-space barrier, allowing him to transport the opponent's attack somewhere else.</p><p>Like his sensei Jiraiya, Minato is capable of summoning frogs/toads.</p><p>Full List of Jutsu:</p><p>Eight Trigrams Sealing Style</p><p>Flying Thunder God</p><p>Four Symbols Seal</p><p>Rasengan</p><p>Reaper Death Seal</p><p>Summoning Technique: Toads</p><p>Time-Space Barrier</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origins of Tek Jansen</h2><p>While not much is known about the early life of Tek Jansen, it is known his adult life has been a constant blend of space adventures, dire situations with giant beasts and insidious enemies, and sexual promiscuity with \"hundreds of girlfriends.\"</p><h2>The New Tek Jansen: Animated Episodes</h2><ul><li>Season 1, Chapter 1: \"Operation: Heart of the Phoenix: Dead or Alive\"</li></ul><h3>The episode begins with a robot approaching a space station, requesting access. Access is given, and Tek Jansen emerges from the robot and kills the guards. Tek continues on to find the File Sector to find the plans for the Inhibitor Cannon so that he can stop the Brazilian from stealing New Earth's cloud supply. Abraxia, Tek's \"most sensual nemesis\" confronts him, at which point they fight and he wins. They then have sex. He wakes up in bed and Abraxia is gone, flying away from the bed that has turned into an insidious space creature and trapped Tek.</h3><ul><li>Season 1, Chapter 2: \"Operation: Destiny's Underbelly: Entrapped!\"</li></ul><h3>The episode begins with \"robots and lasers\" on the verge of destroying Jansen as he's pinned to a torture table. He's able to get his golden toe ring off and jam the incoming saw. A pigeon passing by clutches the ring, but is evaporated by the enemy laser, causing it to drop the ring on the \"Emergency Torture Stop\" button, saving Jansen from certain death. Jansen is then confronted by an alien, four- eyed, snake-tongued tiger, who is shot by Kevin and Jenny, Jansen's comrades. They confront \"the Brazilian\" who is trying to steal all of New Earth's clouds. They attempt to place him under Alpha Arrest, but he goes for his deadly ray gun and kills Kevin.</h3><ul><li>Season 1, Chapter 3: \"Operation: Aurora Strikes Midnight: Courage's Arrival\"</li></ul><h3>The episode begins with Jansen and a woman lying in bed while flying through space. She says that he must have had hundreds of girlfriends, to which he replies, \"Hundreds and one.\" Tek has been dispatched by Senator Depaaa to rendezvous with the Hgwian envoy. Jansen docks at Theta-Zeus-Aquarias after a very long landing process with the spaceship tower. After leaving the ship he's met by a Mutatilsaurus (a Tyrannosaurus Rex with a jet-pack)</h3><ul><li>Season 1, Chapter 4: \"Operation: Homecoming's Doorstep: Cat on a Luniharp\"</li></ul><h3>The episode begins with Tek at a space hospital gathering supplies to deliver to another planet. The doctor's green, four-breasted, four-armed daughter walks in and mentions that Jansen must have had \"hundreds of girlfriends.\" An attack on the ship begins by the Bizlarmian Battlewedge, but the ships defenses can't hold. The ship fires their \"Big Gun\" and destroys the enemy ship, and several planets behind it.</h3><p>Season 1, Chapter 5: \"Operation: Hounds of Hell: Ragtime Billy Peaches\"</p><h3>The episode begins at the Combatosphere orbiting over Asteroid Z, where Tek defeats a giant ape alien by decapitating him and saves the Senator. They escape to the space port and Jansen saves the pilot with an open heart surgery as he helps the pilots wife give birth. Both the wife and the alien Senator begin seducing Tek. When the Senator goes for some wine, she accidently releases a swarm of killer bees.</h3><p> </p><h3> </h3><p>Famous Sayings of Tek Jansen</p><ul><li>\"<i><b>Pa-rum-Pum!</b></i>\": Upon discovering the next step in his space adventures, including when he's about to</li></ul><ul><li>\"<i><b>Solar Plexus</b></i><i><b>!</b></i>\": Said in anger</li><li>\"<i><b>Haley's Comet!</b></i>\": In surprise at an incoming enemy alien tiger</li><li>\"<i><b>Venus Flytrap!</b></i>\": Upon seeing Jenny turn into a giant crab monster.</li><li>\"<i><b>Fudge!</b></i>\": After he breaks off his spaceship's side mirror</li><li>\"<i><b>Nailed it!</b></i>\": Upon landing his spaceship</li><li>\"<i><b>Astro Glide!</b></i>\": When being confronted by the Mutatilsaurus outside Space Station Theta-Zeus-Aquarius</li><li>\"<i><b>Saturn Ion!</b></i>\": When the Bizlarnian Battlewedge commences attack on Tek's ship.</li><li>\"<i><a href=\"http://blogs.dfw.com/photos/uncategorized/apollo_creed.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Apollo Creed</b></a><b>!</b></i>\": When the spaceship air-lock opens.</li></ul><h2>Jansen's Various Women</h2><ul><li><b>Abraxia</b>: Jansen's most sensual nemesis.

But after stopping the biggots Vision arrived, and thought they were causing trouble so he attacked them. Enraged by this sneak attack Glamour and Illsion fought him in defense, and calmed him down.

But the couple were really planing to steal a jewel necklace.</p><p>So Glynis altered her molecules to make herself a semi-liquid organism, and Illusion created a hole in the tank for her to get out and pull the heist, while Illusion stalls the crowd for her to get the necklace. She then reverted back to her original form, but turned her skin into a satin outfit, and created face paint to make herself blend in with the Mardi Gras crowd. Finally reaching the room Glynnis made her body elastic to enter through the room key hole. With her task completed she hurried back to the stage, turned back into her liquid organism form and hid under a tarp her husband threw on the floor for her to regain her orginal form, and clothing.</p><p>After Wanda gave birth to her twin sons, the couple then worried that thier friends would eventually find out they are thieves, and think ill of them pulling jewel heists to make their income so they decided to distance themselves from their friends until they moved. Recently Glamor was attacked by a demon. Due to the attack she was in a coma. Lyja tried to kill the demon but it killed him. She is still in a coma and is unaware of what has happened to Lyja.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Glamor has the superhuman ability to control the molecules of her body mentally. The origin of her power has not yet been revealed. So far few of the uses of Glamor's ability have been observed, but it is known that she can control the density of her molecules. Hence she can become virtually intangible, and in that state can walk through walls, when nearly intangible, she can even touch the Vision even if he is at the same degree of intangibility. When she increases the density of her molecules she can increase her strength or weight of her body.</p><p>She also has displayed the abiltiy to turn into a semi- liquid mass and make her body become whatever she touches like when she turned her skin into satin, or alter her apperance by creating facial paint. She also can make herself elastic to a degree that she can enter any room through any size of hole, crack, or key hole (as seen in The Vision and Scarlet Witch Issue 9) it is unknown if she could stretch her limbs at will but it could be possible. Glamor can also use her mental control to make her body separate into segments without harming herself, and then be able to rejoin the segments of her body to regain her normal form. But this was never shown.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Pre-crisis</h2><p> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Joe Meach used to be a world famous diver who had been having some bad times. He had an idea to make himself known again. His idea was to jump from a tall building into a tiny bucket. Unfortunately, the tank he was aiming for had already sprung a leak so he would be jumping to his death. As he was falling <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\"> Superman</a> came and saved Joe. Joe was mad at what he done but, Superman pointed out he would have been jumping into an inch of water. He was mad at the fact he had no job or anything now. </p><p> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After hearing of his misfortunes Superman felt pity on him and offered Joe a job at the Superman museum. He had been working there for a while, until one night when it was raining and stormy Joe happened to be next to the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\"> Legion of Super-Heroes</a> exhibit and lightning came through the window, striking him and the statues, knocking him out. When he woke up he had not only the powers of Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes, but a new personality out to destroy <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\"> Batman</a> and Superman. He was known as Composite-Superman. </p><p> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Joe had changed half his body to look like Batman while the other half looked like Superman and his skin color the same as <a href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\"> Brainiac 5</a>. He eventually called the two heroes and asked them to join their team and threatened if he could not he would expose their identity. He easily learned their identity by reading their minds. Then Batman and Superman had a talk with Composite Superman trying to see his face but Composite Superman had covered it with a layer of lead. They agreed to let Composite Superman join them, while in reality Composite Superman really just wanted to get back at Superman, Batman and his sidekick <a href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\"> Robin</a> (<a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Tim Drake</a>). He started trying to make the heroes look bad. He turned part of a building into <a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\"> Kryptonite</a> and as it was falling Superman tried to stop it, but became weak and people watched while Superman struggled to lift it up. But then Composite Superman lifted it with ease, saving the day and embarrassing Superman by making him look weak. </p><p> </p><p>Next he was with Batman and Robin late at night as they were tailing two crooks. Batman told him to stay back and let Robin and him handle this. As Batman and Robin were sliding down ropes to sneak up on the crooks Composite Superman instantly made them too heavy, forcing their ropes to break. Then he stretched his hands out to catch the bad guys and eventually he ended up saving the day. Superman and Batman started getting suspicious of Composite Superman and as they were speaking of a way to try and figure out what he was up to, Composite Superman was listening to them in disguise. Later he had changed into Robin and got in the <a href=\"/batmobile/4055-41463/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\"> Batmobile</a>. Suddenly the top had closed on him and he was curious. He asked what’s wrong and Batman said he wasn’t Robin because Robin and Batman practiced wearing seat belts while driving. Composite Superman revealed himself and flew right through the roof of the Batmobile and knocked Batman out and took him away.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually he met up with Superman in his layer but before Superman had been looking around and realized that Composite Superman wasn’t just trying to take over the planet but in fact the whole universe. Superman tried to talk to him but a fight broke out. Superman was outmatched and only getting one punch in. Composite Superman then put a Kryptonite ring on Superman. He then flew off with Superman and Batman to lay waste to the two but while flying Batman and Superman both noticed that Composite Superman was flying slower as the moments passed and that he also was lowering down. He then dropped the two heroes and flew back to the museum. Their he tried to zap the statues of the Legion of Super-Heroes and give himself powers again but he ran out of juice and couldn’t. Then he tried to write on the paper of how he could turn back but stopped about mid way. Meanwhile Superman and Batman were falling down to their deaths. Batman pulled the Kryptonite ring off Superman so he could fly them away from their death. Batman managed to pull the ring off waking Superman and then Superman flew the two to safety. Meanwhile in the museum Joe woke up with a piece of paper in his hand reading what Composite Superman had left behind for him to see but couldn’t make it out due to the fact that it wasn’t finished leaving the heroes clueless to who Composite Superman really was.</p><p> </p><p>Composite Superman (Joseph Meach) was created by Edmund Hamilton, Curt Swan, George Klein and Shelly Moldoff.</p><p>Composite Superman (Xan) was created by Cary Burkett, George Tuska and Frank McLaughlin.</p><p> </p><h2>Post-Crisis</h2><p>This creature was created by accident by <a href=\"/professor-ivo/4005-22015/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22015\"> Professor Ivo</a>. He originally tried to make clones of the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\"> Justice League</a> to serve him but had little success, or so he thought. He buried the failures and later made <a href=\"/amazo/4005-3737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3737\"> Amazo</a>. Later his attempted clones merged into one being and dug its way out of the ground. He broke into a costume shop and took a Superman and Batman costume. He sewed them together down the middle and went on trying to live out both Superman's and Batman's life. He tried to get rid of them and took both <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\"> Lois Lane</a> and <a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\"> Tim Drake</a> hostage. He was later attacking <a href=\"/metallo/4005-4689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4689\"> Metallo</a> when Batman and Superman arrived, but the duo could not defeat him and he escaped. They tracked him down and told him if he wanted to be both of them then go ahead. They told him of many crimes taking place and he could not decide who to help first. He lost it and ripped himself apart before they could help him.</p><h2>Composite Superman/Batman Rocket Ship </h2><figure style=\"width: 767px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1381498\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.52281616688396\" data-width=\"767\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1381498\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg 767w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74414/1381498-supermanbatmanrocket.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px\" data-width=\"767\"></a></figure><p>When Asteroid X, a massive chunk of Kryptonite, was found to be hurtling towards the Earth, Superman and Batman contacted a young genius in <a href=\"/japan/4020-55746/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\">Japan</a> named <a href=\"/hiro-okamura/4005-33525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33525\"> Hiro Okamura</a> to build something capable of taking care of the asteroid.

    "deck": "Shin Hayata is a member of the Science Patrol, a force that fights evil monsters from outer space. But this team is sometimes not enough, that's when Hayata has to turn into the giant hero Ultraman.",
    "description": "<h2>The Beginning</h2><p>Shin Hayata was a member of the Science Patrol, until one night, he was distracted while flying his plane by a red sphere in the air. Hayata crashed and died, the red sphere turned out to be a the ship of a giant alien being who had red and silver skin, this being came from the M78 Nebula. The being thought that it was his fault that Hayata had died, so he gave his life to him, and they both became one person. Every time that danger came near, Hayata transformed into Ultraman to fight the evil, and protect Earth.</p><h2>Monsters</h2><p>In the series, the year is 1993 (it was actually 1963) and at this time Earth is constantly being attacked by evil alien creatures, and the Science Patrol is the only force capable of fighting the monsters from outer space, but sometimes they aren't enough against the creatures. That's when Hayata comes in and turns into the giant hero, Ultraman.</p><p>After a long hard battle, Ultraman would finish his enemy with his ultimate move, the Specium Ray. This meant that if Ultraman did this move, you knew the fight was over. The series had a lot of monsters from including Baltan, Ace Killer, Zetton and many more. Many of Ultraman`s kind followed in his footsteps like Ultraman Jack, Ultraman Leo, Ultraman Ace, and many more.</p><p> </p><h2>Superpowers</h2><p>This list covers powers used in and outside the series.</p><ul><li><strong>Specium Ray</strong>: Ultraman crouches slightly forward and crosses his wrists together, with his right forearm vertical and left forearm horizontal in front of it, and the thumb edge of his hands facing his body, to shoot from the outer edge of his right hand a particle/light-ray that kills most opponents. The effect is either an explosion or a fatal burn. The ray can be reflected (see Alien Baltan II) but loses intensity once reflected. The ray can also be negated by similar energy (see Alien Mephilas). Spacium is actually a substance found on Mars that itself is deadly to at least one monster species (the Baltans). The Spacium Ray--indeed all of Ultraman's Spacium-type energy attacks--may be based on that substance, but this is never stated as the case in the series. Regardless, the Spacium Ray is perhaps Ultraman's most powerful single weapon, and very few of the monsters he fights are immune to it; Antlar, Keronia and Zetton are among those few.</li><li><strong>Ultra Slash</strong>: Ultraman fires a saw-like Spacium-energy ring (a Cutting Halo) from his hand. This Halo can slice his opponent in half. The Cutting Halo does have drawbacks, however; a Baltan alien was able to deflect a Halo with his barrier, Gubira was lucky enough to catch a second Halo on his nose rather than be sliced by it, and Keelar was just as lucky to catch a third Halo with his tail. Alien Mephilas destroyed a fourth Halo with his Bare Hand Beam, and a fifth Halo shattered after striking Zetton's barrier.</li><li><strong>Electrical Immunity</strong>: Ultraman is shown to immune to electrical or lightning attacks. Not all Ultra-Crusaders have this immunity.</li><li>Ultra Attack Beam: By focusing energy from his left hand into a spiral energy beam around his right arm, then directing the energy at a target creature, Ultraman can induce a temporal stasis, in effect paralyzing the target. This is a rare power, Ultraman only used it once.</li><li>High Spin: Ultraman can counter temporal/spatial attacks or can damage opponents by spinning rapidly in an upright position. The attack is remote, and does not involve beams, but it can rip space on a local level, cause remote explosions, or create immobilizing rings of force.</li><li><strong>Ultra Air Catch Version I</strong>: Using narrow beams from his index fingers, Ultraman can paralyze objects suspended in mid-air. This is followed by a Cutting Halo that divides in two to cut the suspended object into thirds. (He used this power against the second Redking, who had s</li><li><strong>Ultra Psychokinesis</strong>: Ultraman is shown to posses telekinetic abilities.</li><li><strong>Flight</strong>: Ultraman can propel himself in a controlled manner through the air. Apparently it takes little energy to do this, as he almost always is able to launch at the conclusion of a fight and get out of sight to change back into his human host.</li><li><strong>Teleportation</strong>: In dire emergencies when flying to a location would be too slow, Ultraman can teleport to it instead. Ultraman used this power to return to Earth from Planet R, in order to combat an invading Baltan forces. However, this power has a high energy demand and his warning light will usually turn red and/or begin to blink as soon as he arrives at his destination. When Ultraman teleports, he leaves behind Hayata's body in its comatose state, and the two cannot re-merge until they are in sufficient proximity.</li><li><strong>Ultra Current</strong>: Ultraman can direct a high-pressure stream of water from his fingertips by touching his hands together. This may not actually be water from Ultraman's body, but rather a forced condensation of water in the atmosphere channeled into a stream.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Size Change</strong>: Ultraman can control his molecular structure, phasing from human-size to giant-size. He places his hands in front of his chest at 45 degree angles, thumb edge facing inward, and then sharply gestures outward. This is not the same as his transformation from human form as Hayata.</li><li><strong>Clairvoyance Beam</strong>: Ultraman's vision extends into a wider range of the electromagnetic spectrum than that of humans, at least into infra-red and ultraviolet, and probably further to include gamma rays and X-rays. One manifestation of this power is a beam of energy, resembling a spotlight, that is emitted from Ultraman's eyes and which renders electromagnetic cloaks used by shielded objects and beings inoperative.</li><li><strong>Slash Beam</strong>: In his battle against Alien Mephilas, Ultraman used this line of chevron-like bolts fire from his fingertips while the two where in flight, and Mephilas countered with his Bare Hand Beam, which resulted in Ultraman being temporarily blinded.</li><li><strong>Catch Rings</strong>: Ultraman spinning at high speeds, can produce three yellow energy rings to bind an opponent.</li><li><strong>Beta Capsule Transformation</strong>: Ultraman's cohabitation within Hayata's body is not entirely unlike the religious or spiritual concept of possession. However, Ultraman does not attempt to control Hayata's decision-making. Hayata's mind and spirit control his body under ordinary circumstances. Yet it is possible, as evidenced by the many close calls to Hayata's life, that Ultraman can intercede in some way to protect Hayata's body, presumably in the form of accelerated healing of injuries as Hayata would be injured in some episodes. However, injuries that Hayata sustains are not transferred to Ultraman when Hayata ignites the Beta Capsule, and Hayata can still be shown as wounded when Ultraman reverses the change. Also when Hayata was hypnotized by underground aliens in an effort to control Ultraman, the plan failed since they did not count on the fact that Ultraman would be immune to mind control by them. Only the Beta Capsule can trigger the physical transformation from Hayata to Ultraman. Where the Beta Capsule goes when Ultraman is active is not known, but during his first battle with Gomora the Beta Capsule was somehow separated from him by a strong attack from the monster. This also revealed that the Beta Capsule only works for Hayata, as the child who retrieved the capsule tripped its ignite switch and nothing happened to either the child or Hayata. When Hayata ignites the capsule, Ultraman does not have to appear precisely where Hayata was standing, but he usually does appear very close to that location, and often, but not always, in a similar pose. Should Hayata use the Beta Capsule inside a building, Ultraman can choose to appear from within it or outside of it, even projecting himself during transformation through the specially-reinforced walls of Science Patrol Headquarters. One occasion demonstrates the variability: Hayata was atop a building during a mission where Alien Baltan was attacking, and the Beta Capsule fell out of his reach and landed on a ledge below. With Hayata needing to transform immediately and having no way to reach the device safely, he took an extraordinary gamble by throwing himself headfirst off the building, and managed to grab the capsule and ignite it as he fell. Ultraman then appeared on the ground, safely standing on his feet. Ultraman changes back to human form by beaming a spiral of energy from his hands to a point on the ground. Hayata's body materializes within this spiral, and Ultraman's body vanishes. The only episode that showed Hayata split from Ultraman and laying in a coma was when Ultraman teleported from a planet he had destroyed some Baltans on back to Earth so that he could finish off the rest off them. For unknown reasons, Hayata's body was left behind in a deep coma state, possibly in stasis, until Ultraman returned. Either the teleportation power somehow split them apart or else Ultraman left Hayata's body behind to maintain the secret identity.</li></ul><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p>Despite all these amazing powers, Ultraman has one main weakness: Since Earth's atmosphere leeches away his solar energy, Ultraman can only physically exist on Earth for approximately three to five minutes of Earth time. To signal this, a warning light in Ultraman's chest starts out at blue. At the 1 minute mark it starts to blink, and then turns red and blinks faster at the two minute mark. Some sources have given 2:10 as the mark where the timer begins to blink.</p><p>If the Color Timer/warning light stops, Ultraman will \"never rise again.\" Obviously, at whatever point the blinking begins, Ultraman typically has only a short amount of time left to defeat his foe and return to his human host. They told Mebius that if they transformed again while the barrier was up that they risked permanent death. Despite this, and the fact that their color timers began flashing soon into the battle, any time limits or risk of actual death were not in evidence.</p><p>With the destruction of the barrier and Zoffy and Taro re-energizing the four of them they were restored to their full power. This would seem to support the idea that the Color Timer acts more as a Fuel Gauge and that the three minute time limit that Ultra-Crusaders operate under on Earth is more of an average time limit, rather than an absolute. When Zetton defeated Ultraman, his timer was still faintly flashing but he was too drained to fight and collapsed and would have had his timer go out completely if Zoffy had not arrived to recharge him.</p><p>Subsequent Ultra series have had other Ultra-Crusaders experience total energy loss and their timer and eyes going dark, yet still being revived by an infusion of energy. It is likely that once the timer goes out, the time needed to infuse new energy into the dying Ultra-Crusader is short, and that permanent death is still possible.</p><h2>Statistics</h2><p><strong>Ultraman's Statistics</strong></p><ul><li>Home Planet: \"The Land Of Light,\" Nebula M78</li><li>Height: 40 meters (131 feet)</li><li>Weight: 35,000 tons (Earth gravitation)</li><li>Age: 20,000 Earth years old</li><li>Flight Speed: Mach 5</li><li>Jump Ceiling: 800 meters (2,600 feet)</li><li>Running Speed: 450 kilometers per hour (280 miles per hour)</li><li>Swimming Speed: 200 knots (230 miles per hour)</li><li>Physical Strength: Though never precisely measured in the stories, it is presumed to be enough for him to be able to lift (press) over 100,000 tons.

    "description": "<p>Mu is the Gold Saint of Aries, and as such guards the first of the twelve Zodiac temples of Sanctuary.  He is native to the Asian country of Jamir like his master Aries Shion, who later became Grand Pope.  Mu is the only one capable of repairing the Saint Cloths. <br/> <br/>Mu's attacks include \"Starlight Extinction\", \"Stardust Revolution\", and \"Crystal Wall\".  He also possesses formidable telekinetic powers, an ability that is unique among the Saints.  Like the other Gold Saints, he is also capable of telepathy and limited healing.  Mu's apprentice is a young telekinetic boy by the name of Kiki. <br/> <br/>During the Sanctuary arc, Mu passively rebelled against the false Pope, and stayed away from Sanctuary, preferring to reside in Jamir.  He appeared at the Rozan Five Old Peaks on one occasion and intervened when Cancer Deathmask had come to kill Roshi.  Rather than fighting the Bronze Saints who reached his temple, he repaired their Cloths for them. <br/> <br/>Upon the Specters' invasion of Sanctuary, Mu defeated several of them, most notably Papillon Myu.  Mu fought against the resurrected Gold Saints alongside Scorpio and Leo, with whom he performed the forbidden Athena Exclamation technique.  He then traveled to the Underworld to aid Athena, but was quickly defeated by Wyvern Rhadamanthys, as a result of his power being drained by Hades' realm.  Mu was revived from Cocytus and joined the other Gold Saints in their destruction of the Wailing Wall.</p>",

Her heart is made of the X-Blade. When she was 4, she met Aqua and inadvertently touched her Keyblade. Aqua cast a spell on Kairi in which the light of Kairi's would lead to the light of another. A couple of years later, she was sent to Destiny Islands by Xenahort's Heartless. Xenahort wanted to see the connection between a princess of the heart and the Keyblade chosen bearer. When she was left at Destiny Islands, Kairi appeared one night, confused about why were sparkles coming out of the ocean and were floating until they were in the sky and became stars. Sora and Riku appeared and they both thought she was too pretty. Kairi stayed since that night in Destiny Island with no recollection about her past, but she really didn´t care about recollecting that part of her past, because she was happy at Destiny Islands. She lived there happy with <a href=\"/sora/4005-44471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44471\">Sora</a>, a 14 year old boy with spiky hair and also with <a href=\"/riku/4005-45370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45370\">Riku</a>, a 15 year old white-hair boy. Although they were all close friends, Sora and Riku liked Kairi almost since the beggining since the only girl on the island was Selphie but they thought she was too manipulator and she wasn´t pretty enough. Sora and Riku realized they both were after the same girl and they became a little competitive for her attention. Kairi noticed a little about Sora and Riku´s reaction when she was close to each of them. There are many proves to conclude their affection to Kairi. They even raced towards the papou fruit (it is the fruit that if two share it, their destinies chaines and will be together forever) and Riku said the first who arrives, will share it with Kairi. They both liked her too much, they even started to begin being rivals.</p><p>Sora, Riku and Kairi had an idea of making a boat to sail away from Destiny Islands, with the intention of knowing the outsider world. Sora was asleep until he knew some rare creatures were attacking their home island and the raft was destroyed. He went to look for his friends and found out that Riku has given himself to the darkness so he went to look for Kairi. He had earned the keyblade and saw Kairi at the secret cave. Kairi stared at the door that Riku had oppened and were the heartless came from. Kairi turned at Sora and suddenly a strong wind pushed her towards Sora. Sora opened his arms to catch her and protect her, but as soon she was in his arms, she vanished into sparkles. Sora had been dragged into a tornado and sucked up until he ended in Transverse Town.</p><p>As soon as Sora woke up he made his promise to look for Kairi and later Riku.</p><p>Riku as knowing where had Kairi been dragged to, he went to her. As soon as he saw her she was in a vegetal-like-state. Riku had was informed that her heart wasn´t in her anymore, he asumed that th heartless has stole her heart. Riku was lured by Malificient to join them so he could bring Kairi back to normal.</p><p>Sora had finally arrived to Neverland after a long time, now knowing the plot of the worlds, the heartless, what Riku had become, and still with the promise of finding her. He had already met Donald and Goofy, which he has been travelling with all the time. Sora was separated from Donald and Goofy by Riku, so he stops at Captain Hook´s ship to look for them. Sora runs and stares at the sky... \"I never think you´d come Sora, good to see you again\" as he turns and sees Riku and asks him \"Were are Donald and Goofy\" as for Riku says dissapointed \"Are they that important to you.. more important than old friends?!.. Instead of worrying about them, you should be asking... about her\" Riku steps aside and lets Sora sees for the first time, Kairi in the strange state, sitting weak staring at the floor. Sora reacts shouting her name as Riku says \"That´s right, while you were off goofing around, I finally found her\". Sora runs towards Kairi as Captain Hook appears and says to Sora \"Not so fast. No shenanigans aboard my vessel, boy\". Sora sees Riku dissapointed and says \"Riku, why are you siding with the Heartless?\" Riku responds \"The heartless obey me now, Sora. Now I have nothing to fear\". Sora, raged, tells him \"You´re stupid. Sooner or later they will swallow your hearts\" as Riku confident says \"Not a chance. My heart´s too strong\" Sora said \"Riku...\" disappionted. Riku careless about their friendship says \"I´ve picked up another few tricks as well, like this for instance...\" Riku raises his hand and a heartless-looking like Sora popped of the floor and Sora was terrified \"...you can go see your friends now\" as the floor were Sora stood opened and he fell. Riku told Captain Hook \"Let´s get under way, already\" as he walks away and turns back at him \"And keep Sora away from Kairi until we are ready to land\". Captain Hook complained with Smith about why did he had to obey him. Sora finally meets Donald and Goofy and tells them to go and see Kairi. They gather and met with Peter Pan due to him also lost Wendy. Tinker Bell arrives and gives them the exact location about were they both are. Riku appears with the Captain and told him that Wendy was not the 7th Princess of Heart, the Captain complains about why did he make him capture her until Smith tells them both that Sora, Donald and Goofy had escaped. Peter Pan, Sora, Donald, Goofy and Tinker Bell finally arrive as they are one floor down, but there was a hole-floor and could see through it. Wendy hears Peter and asks \"Peter? Peter Pan?\" Peter exclaims \"Wendy!\" Wendy informs him \"Please, hurry!. The pirates are coming!\". Peter Pan said \"What? I´ll be right there just hold on\". Sora in a shy voice asks for Wendy as she responds \"Yes?\" and Sora said \"Is there another girl in there with you??\". Wendy stands her head and notices Kaii \"Oh why, yes..but she seems to be asleep, she hasn´t butched and inch\". Sora preocupied asks \"Kairi? Kairi!\" (Wendy rans towards an dresser pushing it) Sora raises his hand asking for her seeing her. Sora was losing hope of her strongering his arm as Kairi´s hand twitched. Sora exclaimed of hapiness and let out a \"Ha!!\". Some steps came towards the 2 girls, Wendy shouted as Kairi has being dragged. \"Wendy? Hey let´s get up there\" as the try to get up there. Sora, Peter, Donald, Goofy and Tink went almost all Neverland across. Sora tried to find Kairi to push her away from Riku until he had been reasonable. Sora were Riku was heading with Kairi and followed them. Finally they went inside the ship in a room. Sora ran alone in the room¨, he didn´t see Riku and Kairi until he turned to his right and saw them. \"Riku, wait!\" said Sora as Riku was carriyng Kairi still in the state. Riku carrying Kairi walked backwards until a portal reached and they both dissapeared. The heartkes with the form of Sora appeared and they battled. Sora won at last as he and Peter tried to look for Riku and Kairi, but Peter saw Wendy lying on the floor unconcious. Peter tells Sora \"Well this is as far as I can go. I´ve gotta help Wendy\" he carried her and flyed away. Sora battled along with Donald and Goofy until they both met Captain Hook as he complained again \"Quite a cod fish that Riku, running off with that girl without even saying a goodbye..\" Sora exclaimed \"Run off where? tell me, where did he go?!\". The Captain said \"To the ruins of Hollow Bastion, where Maleficient resides..but you wont be going there, unless you intend to leave your little pixie friend behind?\" as he showed Tinker Bell trapped. They finally fight with him as Peter arrives and they defeat them. At last Sora stands in the ship as Goofy, Donald and Peter are behind him and Goofy tells Donald \"Uh, Kairi couldn´t wake up, so maybe she´s really lost her---\" as he puts his hand in his chest, meaning the heart. Donald said sh to him. Peter said \"Sora?\" and Sora says shocked \"I still can´t believe it... I really flew! Wait ´till I see Kairi... I wonder is she´d believe me, probably not\" \"You can bring her to Neverland sometime. Then she can try it herself!\" said Peter, \"If you believe, you can do anything, right?\" said Sora as the nodded \"I´ll find Kairi, I know I will... There is so much I want to tell her--- about flying, the pirates, and everything else that´s happened\". They fly back to the clock tower, were the keyhole lies as Sora closes it.

Later when fighting for Kairi´s heart, he finds that the Heartless didn´t stole the hearts... it was in Sora. Knowing the answer to the problem, the only way to return Kairi´s heart, is by releasing it from him, but there is a consequence. If he fees the heart, his heart could be lost and Sora could be taking the path to death. Sora, not knowing his action will cause a</p><p>consequence beside his heart getting lost, something really important</p><p>in this story, he acted. Sora took the risk, feeling Kairi must be awaken from her state, he grabs the odd keyblade and stabbs himself in his heart. While both hearts (Sora´s and Kairi´s) were set free, Kairi´s heart found the way to her body, but Sora´s got lost and he became a heartless. Kairi woke up and saw Sora, she felt happy, but as she realised Sora didn´t respond and he was falling, Kairi runed towards Sora, with the purpose of grabbing him so he didn´t fall, but he vanished. Riku appeared and he warned Kairi, Donald and Goofy to run, that Heartless were approaching. Kairi, with no choice ran with them as Heartless were appearing. As they run a Heartless saw them staring folloeing them and later stopped. Kairi turned and saw the Heartless. She asked him \"Sora?\" and the heartless looked at her with an odd face. She ran and shouting Sora and hugged him. More heartless were coming and she told him she was going to protect him and as the heartless attacked, she hugged him as the following event Sora turned into his human body.

Kairi one day starts to have faint memory's of a second boy from her past who's name she can not quite remember. Coming back from school one day with Selphie (from Final Fantasy VIII), Selphie asked if Kairi would go to the island with her because Wakka and Tidus (from Final Fantasy X) were to caught up in there ball game. Kairi asked Selphie if she remembered of the boys that she played with when they were younger but she only could remember Riku, asking if she my have only made up th other boy. Kairi says that she did not wont to go back to the Island until she can remember that other boy who was so important to her. Finishing saying this she gets a really strong headache and hears a voice This is the same time Roxas calls out to Namine for help but reaches Kairi instead. (Due to Namine coming in contact with Roxas all four of them become connected). Kairi says who was there. A voice said \"Hey, I'm Roxas\". Kairi responds saying \"Im Kairi\" Roxas lets out a laugh and says \"So you´re the one he likes\" Kairi confused, asks who is the other one, feeling two presences. Sora answers \"C´mon Kairi, you don't remember me?\", and then Kairi stayed even more confused and Sora said dissapointed but in a buffon way \"Thanks a lot Kairi! \" Kairi tried to say something but she didn´t \"OK I can give you a hint, it starts with an S\". With that Kairi wakes up Selphie helping her to her feet. When she is standing she runs off to the beach with Selphie following behind her. At the beach she takes out a message in a bottle and sends it out to sea hoping that the boy from her past may find it and rewrite. Selphie asks what it was that she sent. Kairi answers that her and the boy made a promise to each other and the message is part of that promise. Speaking out loud she says, \"Begins with an S. Isn't that right SORA\". By this time all her memory's have been restored. As the days go by waiting she grows tired of waiting and decides to go looking for him. Kairi, one day she goes to the beach seeing at the ocean. From the nowhere, Pluto appears and barks at her. Kairi bents down, and massages Pluto´s head. She appeared to be happy, but Axel appeared through a black portal.

Kairi was in a trance, and imagined to see Sora again. Pluto also untrustable about Axel, barks, waking Kairi from her day-dream. Ablack portal appeared and Kairi shouts and says \"You´re not acting very friendly!\" and runs along with Pluto through the portal. A portal to the darkness opens and she escapes through there, and ends up in Twilight Town. She pops out in Hayner, Pence, and Olette's hang out she stays long enough to tell them about her journey and her search for Sora. Olette tells her that it is a romantic story and out of nowhere, Axel appeared and Kairi reacts jumping out of the sofa. Axel tells her she disobeyed his good wat to tell her. Hayner runs towards him and passes through him as Pence did too. Olette was pushed aside and Axel took Kairi´s hand and pulled her through a black portal. Kairi hesitated but she was taken away. The Organization soon finds Kairi and they take her away and put her in a cell in their stronghold along with Pluto. She is kept there in hopes of using her to manipulate Sora. She is rescued by Namine. As Kairi and Namine's hands touch a bright light emits from the both of them. Sora who is at that moment looking for a why into the Organizations castle sees the gleam of light and his keyblade reacts creating a light bridge up to them. Namine gets Kairi to the out side stairwell and as they run they are stopped by Saix and two Nobody bodyguards. The two guards vanish revealing a black cloaked person who looks like a member of the Organization, Namine shouts in worry Riku, revealing this unknown person to be her other lost friend. Riku fights Saix but he slips through his fingers into a dark portal created into a wall. Before Riku follows, Kairi calls for him to stop. Namine tells Riku that he can look after her now, as she vanishes. Kairi slowly walks towards him and removes his hood revealing the face of Ansem. But it is truly Riku, only he has retaken the form of Ansem, in order to use the powers of darkness to search for Sora and Kairi. In order to do this he has to surrender his heart back over to the darkness, unfortunately for Riku his eyes are not so easily deceived as is his heart. So he in Riku form now has to wears a blindfold to trick him mind.</p><p>They reunite in the castle of the Organization, which is now discovered to be led by the Nobody of Xenhort, AKA Xemnas an assistant of Ansem's, who has been posing as Ansem his old teacher. When he returns to his normal self from the brilliant light from the explosion of Ansem's machine he finally removes the blindfold and the black cloak to ware his original clothes. With her pure heart Kairi is chosen by another Keyblade and Riku sets out to rejoin Kairi with Sora. Even though Xemnas's Heartless is gone his Nobody remains. Sora defeats Xemnas once but Xemnas combines with Kingdom Hearts and escapes. The Heart of all the worlds help them and combine there power to form a door so they can go after him and stop him for good. Riku, now back in his true form, and Sora are separated from Kairi and the group when they go to stop the Nobodies for good. Riku and Sora defeat the Nobodies and go back at the nobodies castle were a door has opened to Destiny Island. Sora, Donald and Goofy were standing behind Kairi, without her noticing. Donald finally said \"Kairi, you look great!\" as Kairi turns exclaiming \"Oh\" she turns and sees Sora as she looks surprised and relaxes. Kairi flicked her hair as they both wlaked towards each other. Sora said \"You are different Kairi... but Im just glad you are here!\" , Kairi responded \"You and Riku never came home, so I came looking for you\". Sora lowed his head, dissapointed that he didn´t furfilled his promise of arriving, he turned his face to the left, not wanting to Kairi seeing him regreting, he closed his eyes and said \"Im sorry\". Kairi ran towards Sora as he hugged him, catching him unaware. At first, Sora didnt react, not responding with a hug due to him being a bit shocked, until Kairi said \"This is real...\".

As Sora reads the letter that said:</p><blockquote>Thinking of you, wherever you are<br />We pray for our sorrows to end<br />And hope that our hearts will blend.<br />Now I will step forward to realize this wish.<br />And who knows:<br />Starting a journey may not be so hard<br />or maybe it has already begun<br />There are many worlds,<br />but they all share the same sky-<br />one sky, one destiny...</blockquote><p> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-622675\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622675-2152002409_3239dc61b2.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622675-2152002409_3239dc61b2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-622675\"><img alt=\"Kairi´s letter to Sora\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622675-2152002409_3239dc61b2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622675-2152002409_3239dc61b2.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kairi´s letter to Sora\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622675-2152002409_3239dc61b2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622675-2152002409_3239dc61b2.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kairi´s letter to Sora</figcaption></figure><p>When Sora finished reading this, Sora´s and Kairi's hearts connected, opening a door to the light. Sora was walking towards it, but Riku didn´t, so Sora cheered him to go and Riku did. They went to the portal and landed at Destiny Islands´s sea. The two of them saw Kairi jumping and waving. Sora happy swam as fast as he could to see Kairi. He was looking at her still in the water, but close. Before Sora could tell her something, Donald and Goofy appeared next to Kairi, jumping of hapiness and jump towards Sora, knocking him and they three laugh and hugh (the same as Riku with King Mickey). Sora looks at Kairi and Kairi back. Sora says exiting \"Were back!\" and Kairi corrects him \"You´re home\" and they smile at each other (it shows Roxas as Sora and Naminé as Kairi smiling too) and Sora happy as ever, holds her hand.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"large\" data-ref-id=\"1300-622678\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622678-opq.jpg\" style=\"width: 805px\" data-ratio=\"0.21739130434783\" data-width=\"805\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:21.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622678-opq.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-622678\"><img alt=\"Sora returning to the islands\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px\" data-width=\"805\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622678-opq.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622678-opq.jpg 805w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27174/622678-opq.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sora returning to the islands\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622678-opq.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/622678-opq.jpg 805w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27174/622678-opq.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px\" data-width=\"805\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sora returning to the islands</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Kingdom Hearts continues</strong></p><p>Days pass and everything begins to seem to be finally over with Mickey, Donald, and Goofy all back on their world.</p><p>Sora and Riku are showed looking at the sea and Sora says \"Nothing has changed has it?\" and Riku answers \"Nope, nothing will\"</p><p>Kairi screams and Sora and Riku looks at her as she is running towards them \"Sora, Riku!\" she has a bottle with a letter inside.

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><h3>Samurai: Heaven and Earth</h3><p>In Kaga Province in 1704, a Chinese army of thousands attacks a Japanese castle of barely a hundred. During the battle only two samurai are shown to survive, one being the main character Asukai Shiro who was knocked out under a pile of rubble. The other survivor, Masahiro informs him that Yoshiko was taken by the Chinese. Shiro then acts as Masahiro's second for ritual suicide as he does not have anything to live for. Shiro then pursues the Chinese to China and battles the warlord and his small army at his fortress after learning that Yoshiko was sold to an Arab slave merchant.</p><p>Shiro follows the Arab to Paris, where he is accosted by bigoted Frenchmen at Notre Dame, he then battles three musketeers, eventually being subdued when one hits him from the back with a barrel of wine.</p><p>Shiro is then imprisoned in Bastille. He is released under the care of a Spanish Ambassador, Don Miguel Ratera Aguilar Y Aragon who plans on using him to assassinate Louis XIV in Versailles. There he learns that Yoshiko has been bought by Louis XIV, which causes him to no longer want to complete the assassination and just leave, unfortunately Louis and the musketeers don't know that and a battle ensues.</p><p>Don Miguel tries to kill Shiro after learning he will not complete the assassination, during the battle Shiro is knocked unconscious and Don Miguel leaves with Yoshiko for Spain. The last comic ends with Shiro riding from Versailles on a horse that was given to him by the musketeers.</p>",

However, Raditz was disappointed to find out that Goku's programming had been erased, and Goku had instead of used his powers to take over the world as his programming had been set to, he had helped the people of Earth. Raditz took <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> as a hostage, and warned Goku that if he didn't join him, he would kill his son. Goku would not join Raditz, <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a> and Goku united to battle Raditz.</p><p>Gohan watched the battle from inside the Saiyan's space ship. During this, Gohan's rage is unleashed, and attacks Raditz with one single blow, enough for Goku to put his opponent on a head lock. Piccolo takes advantage and blasts at both of them with the extremely powerful move known as the Makankossapo, killing both Goku and Raditz. Just before Raditz died, Piccolo told him that Goku would live because of the seven magical <a href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\">Dragon Balls</a>. Raditz surprised him by telling Piccolo that he had transmitted this information to two more powerful saiyans ( <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a> and <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>), and that they would arrive in search for the Dragon Balls in one year.</p><h2>After Death</h2><p>When Goku reached the checkout station and was preparing to jounrey to King Kai's planet for training, Goku asked King Yemma what became of his brother's soul. Yemma states that Raditz caused a lot of trouble when he arrived and King Yemma had to fight him order to send him to hell. Yemma used his patented Yemma lock to subdue Raditz. Once Goku reached King Kai's planet and began his training King Kai invited Raditz to his planet for a chance at defeating Goku, but he was unable to defeat his him and sent back to hell.</p><p>Later Raditz learned of King Yemma's fruit and defeated the trolls guarding the fruit. Goku was sent with Gregory and Bubbles to stop Raditz in hell. Raditz planned on eating the fruit and becoming more powerful than King Yemma. Raditz was once again defeated by Goku.</p><p>When Gohan was looking for the final Dragon ball to revive his father he had to seek help from <a href=\"/uranai-baba/4005-61822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61822\">Fortuneteller Baba</a> and since he could not pay her fee Gohan was forced to fight her fighters like his father had to do when he was younger. Gohan's final opponent was Raditz who was revived for one day by Baba as a test of Gohan's strength. Raditz was defeated by his nephew.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4449773\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4449773-7115416597-ab34b.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.408940397351\" data-width=\"604\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 604px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4449773-7115416597-ab34b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4449773\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4449773-7115416597-ab34b.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4449773-7115416597-ab34b.jpg 604w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" data-width=\"681\"></a></figure><p>Raditz at the start of the series was able to outpace both Goku and Piccolo at the same time and utterly dominate them both in battle.In a earlier fight between Piccolo and Raditz. Piccolo's blast was completely useless against Raditz.Raditz was able to tank the blast with no ill effects. Raditz can effortlessly catch a bullet,which was fired from a farmer.In relation to the rest of the Saiyan army and Freeza's World Trade organization, Raditz is a low level solider who gets little respect and is barley more powerful than the Saibamen used by Nappa. Even so Raditz is capable of moving faster than the human eye can track, fire energy blasts, fly under his own power, and smash stone with his strength.

    "deck": "Yajirobe is a character from the manga/anime Dragonball and Dragonball Z. He isn't very strong or brave but is skilled with a katana and has come through in past situations.",
    "description": "<h2>Dragon Ball</h2><h3>King Piccolo Saga</h3><p>Yajirobe was first introduced in the King Piccolo Saga as a wandering ronin with an insatible appetite. He met Goku after the latter ate his breakfast which consisted of a huge fish. Upset, Yajirobe engaged Goku in combat.</p><p>The two had an even fight and both surprised each other with their strength and endurance. After stalemating, they were approached by the third spawn of King Piccolo named Cymbol who was after the Dragonball Yajirobe owned.</p><p>After winning a game of Rock - Paper - Scissors with Goku, Yajirobe personally challenges Cymbol in a fight. Yajirobe quickly recovers from Cymbol's physical blows and successfully evades the demon's Beam Rays as he sprints towards Cymbol and slices him with ease. Cymbol is then subsequently roasted and eaten by Yajirobe as a replacement for his lost fish.</p><p>Afterwards, Yajirobe witnesses Goku murder Tamborine in revenge for Krillin, and hides as King Piccolo brutally beats down Goku. Yajirobe helps the severely injured Goku and decides to help him get to Korin Tower after being promised special food by Goku.</p><p>With the initial assisted help from Bora, Yajirobe manages to successfully climb to the top of Korin Tower with Goku on his back. Once at the top, Yajirobe gets aquinted with Korin and introduced to the rejuvinating Senzu Beans.</p><p>Later, Yajirobe watches Goku power up from the Ultra Divine Water and King Piccolo's demise at the hands of Goku. Yajirobe manages to saves Goku's life by catching him before he hit the ground, and is seen leaving with Goku to heal his wounds at the Korin Tower.</p><h3>Piccolo Jr. Saga</h3><p>Three years later, Yajirobe disguises himself and enters the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament. Unfortunately, Yajirobe is easily defeated by a disguised Kami in the last match of the preliminaries.</p><p>After the end of the Tournament, Yajirobe assists a severely injured Goku by handing him a Senzu Bean.</p><h2>Dragonball Z</h2><h3>Saiyan Saga</h3><p>After a five year timeskip, Yajirobe is instructed by Kami gather all of the Z-Fighters to receive training for the arrival of two more Saiyans after the Saiyan Raditz. Yajirobe arrives at Kami House and delivers the message to Krillin who in turn alerts the others.</p><p>Once at Kami's Lookout, Yajirobe trains with Krillin, Yamcha, Chiaotzu, and Tien for a year. Despite his lack of enthusiasm and spending most of his time eating, he does end up surpassing Kami and Mr. Popo in power.</p><p>When the Saiyans finally arrive, Yajirobe initially decides to not get involved but eventually watches from the sidelines as Goku battles Vegeta and most of the Z-Fighters except Krillin and Gohan are dead.</p><p>At a seemingly hopeless moment in the battle, Yajirobe unexpectedly pulls through as he cuts of the tail of Vegeta transformed as a Great Ape from behind. This results in Vegeta losing his transformation and most of his power.</p><p>When Vegeta eventually reclaims the upper hand, Yajirobe once agains helps out by slashing Vegeta's battle armor from behind to protect Gohan. Yajirobe initially assumes he killed Vegeta and arrogantly brags about his victory. Once Vegeta regains conciousness, he brutally beats down Yajirobe as payback.</p><p>However, Yajirobe's distraction provided Gohan enough time to look at Vegeta's present Power Ball and transform into a Great Ape to eventually defeat Vegeta.</p><h3>Namek Saga</h3><p>Yajirobe is seen with the group at Wunkong Hospital in West City healing from his injuries from the battle with the Saiyans. Yajirobe's injuries were relatively minor, so he wasn't kept in the hospital like Goku.</p><p>Yajirobe eventually delivers a new crop of Senzu Beans to Goku to instantly heal from his injuries and allow Goku to travel to Namek.</p><h3>Android Saga</h3><p>Yajirobe briefly appears in the Android Saga to deliver a fresh bag of Senzu Beans to the Z-Fighters but doesn't join the join out of not wanting to get killed.</p><p>While leaving in his hovercraft, Yajirobe is attacked by Androids 20 and 19. However, he survives and is carried to safety by the Z-Fighters.</p><p>Eventually, Yajirobe is seen at Korin Tower as Goku tests his new power in front of Korin to compare to Perfect Cell.</p><h3> Majin Buu Saga</h3><p>Yajirobe is seen continuing to stay at Korin Tower and is eventually killed by either Super Buu's Human Extinction Act, or Kid Buu's destruction of Earth from his Planet Burst attack.</p><p>Although he did not see the significance in raising his hands, Yajirobe participates in giving his energy to Goku's Super Spirit Bomb to eventually destroy Majin Buu for good.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>At the time of his introduction, Yajirobe appeared to be amongest the strongest humans alive.</p><p>Yajirobe was able to contend with Goku in an even fight and managed to kill Cymbal who was a minion of King Piccolo. Yajirobe also managed to climb up Korin's tower on his first try with Goku on his back with greater ease than Goku himself who initially struggled to climb the tower.</p><p>However, as the series goes on, Yajirobe quickly becomes outclassed and suprassed by not only Goku but even the other primary Z-Fighters and antagonists. This is the result of his laziness and cowardly nature. Despite this, Yajirobe still managed to acheive a power greater than Kami himself after bare minimal training for the Saiyans and is the strongest Earthling unable to utilize Ki.</p><p>Yajirobe is also a skilled swordsman being able to slash through tough objects or enemies thicker than the katana with ease. This played a vital role in the Saiyan Saga when Yajirobe managed to cut off Vegeta's tail while he was transformed as a Great Ape despite a monstrous power gap.</p><p> </p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Flash and Kill - A rush attack where Yajirobe slashes an opponent into the air and then waits for the enemy to fall back down. As the enemy hits the ground, Yajirobe slashes them again.</p><p>Gigantic Rock Throw - Yajirobe uses his strength to hurl a boulder at his enemy.</p><p>Ka-Blam Hammer - Yajirobe rushes full speed at the opponent and knocks them up into the air, sending them propelling. Yajirobe then flies after them and performs a combination of four punches and smashes them down.</p><p>Ka-Blam Slicer - Yajirobe creates a very large beam of energy from his sword and launches it at the opponent.</p><p>Ki Slash - Yajirobe is able to form an energy slash from his katana. This attack is the only energy based attack Yajirobe knows.</p><p>Miracle Ka-Blam Slash - A rush attack where Yajirobe uses his katana for a flurry of sword attacks finishing with one final slice. Yajirobe used part of this move to slice off <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>'s tail.</p><h2>Alternate Timeline</h2><p>In the alternate timeline where Goku died of a heart virus and the Z-Fighters never learned of the Androids eventual attack, Yajirobe was one of the fighters who was killed in battle by the Androids. Gohan was the only survivor of the battle and went on to train Future Trunks.</p><h2>Other Media</h2>",

He opened up a bar in The District (known for its vampire-owned businesses), called Dead Dave's.</p><p>Dave still likes to help the police but will never admit to doing so since most of the squad has mixed matched feelings about his new lifestyle. So he gives local animator and vampire slayer, Anita Blake, info that might help the cops catch the bad guys. Anita pays Dave very well for his tips too.</p>",

    "deck": "Kurama is a character from the manga/anime Yu Yu Hakusho. He is a thief in demon world but was injured and was forced to take the body of a human child to recover. He now helps Yusuke fight demons.",
    "description": "<h2>Youth</h2><p>Minamino Shuuichi was a 14-year-old student who lived with his mother, stepfather, and little brother ( at the end of the series ) . He went to an exclusive school which is very well known in Japan. Shuuichi was very intelligent which is why he's often top 1 in his school. He's also very talented, very polite , well-mannered, and very attractive. Most girls in his school are crazy about him and some school clubs are begging him to join their club so that a lot of girls/students would join that particular club. But despite of his \"good moral character\", he also can be very lethal and can kill instantly without hesitating. That is, if someone pushed him to the edge. That is also the reason why Hiei chose him be his partner, due to the fact that he was the only being he had ever fought and not killed instantly. From then on out, they would form a bond that they would keep for the rest of their lives, eventually sharing histories with each other and thus strengthening their bond even more.</p><h2>Backstory</h2><p>Shiori , Shuuichi's human mother, taught him the virtues of life. She also saved Shuuichi's life from falling and hitting his head when he was still young, and that moment was remembered by Shuuichi until now. Kurama / Shuuichi, who was once a youkai with a cold heart, became a warm-hearted person who cares for others, especially for his mother who saved his life. A few years later, Shiori became very ill and cannot be treated. Shuuichi became desperate to find a cure and save his mother. And because of that, he joined a group of thieves from Makai and stole the mirror of rei kai which is one of the 3 most important artifacts. The mirror can grant any wish of its holder but it takes its holder's life in return. When Yusuke was looking for him to retrieve the mirror, Yusuke saw him in the midst of a crowd and Kurama told him through telepathy to go to the hospital after three days. And so, three days had past and in the hospital, Yusuke met Shiori, Shuuichi's ill mother. There he explained his purpose for the mirror and he will return it afterwards. At that time, they were informed that Shiori's condition was already critical. There was no other way except the mirror's power. Just as Shuuichi was about to give up his life for his mother by using the mirror, Yusuke placed his hand to the mirror and offered his life in exchange for Shuuichi's because he couldn't bear to see another mother ( he once saw his own mother grieving for his death in the earlier part of the series ) suffer by losing her son. Shuuichi's wish came true without the mirror taking any life in return because of the good intention of Shuuichi for his mother and also with the help of Yusuke. Shuichi also saved Yusuke from Hiei's attack by striking him at his jagan. He did it to pay off Yusuke for what he had done for Shiori. As punishment for stealing the mirror, he was appointed as a rei kai tantei and he will help Yusuke in his missions.</p><p>Katajima Maya was Shuichi's classmate in school and she also has some psychic ability. She can see demons and other makai beings.She actually saw Shuichi talking to demons in their school, but Shuichi always denies it. Maya fell in love with Shuichi and she told him about it. Shuichi could not tell her that he does not feel the same way about her. Maya was kidnapped that same day by a powerful youkai who eats humans. Shuichi ( with Hiei ) rescued her and defeated that youkai. After that , he erased her memory for the best. She also became Shuichi's girlfriend but only for a short time.</p><p>Shuuichi is a very skilled fighter with a rose whip as his weapon. His rose whip was introduced during his match with Genbu, one of the holy beasts. This whip's thorns can cut almost anything such as metal, rocks, etc. Kurama can strike his opponent several times in a split second using the whip, leaving his opponent sliced into pieces. He can also turn other plants into hideous monsters that are very deadly and uses them against his enemies.</p><h2>Trials With Yusuke</h2><p>His story in the series of Yuyu Hakusho didn't <em>truly</em> start, however, until he had met Yusuke Urameshi, the newest Spirit Detective, one day in a forest outside of a small area in Japan. It was somehow that he knew of the team of demon thieves. Kurama had become a thief with his friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45368\" href=\"/hiei/4005-45368/\" slug=\"hiei\">Hiei</a> and another, unimportant, power hungry demon named Goki, who had only been in it for the power. Well, so had Hiei, but Kurama knew his story, and didn't bother him with never ending speeches about morals. Then again he never did, so he went on when Goki decided to try and kill the Spirit Detective, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45374\" href=\"/yusuke-urameshi/4005-45374/\" slug=\"yusuke-urameshi\">Yusuke Urameshi</a>. Hiei managed to stop him, but in the end, after he left, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46446\" href=\"/goki/4005-46446/\" slug=\"goki\">Goki</a> attacked him anyways, and, after a week or so of seeming inactivity, Yusuke killed him in a most embarrassing way. After this happened, he would eventually come on to terms with Yusuke, and they would meet up and he would tell him of his ultimate goal in stealing the Mirror of Souls : To heal his mother of sickness that she had gotten. Normally, demons were evil, dark creatures that blood lusted, and, seeing such a being with a kind hearted nature, his thoughts on demons were clouded for a while. So, after seeing that Kurama was only in this to help out his mother he became friendly with him, only it would seem that Kurama would have to die in the process. Kurama went on to attempt to sacrifice his life, but was stopped and Yusuke interrupted, sacrificing some of his life instead. This made Kurama furious, but only for an instance, until he realized that Yusuke had only had it in his best interest not to do something that would make him get hurt, where they then came to a mutual agreement not to hurt each other.</p><h2><u><b>The Four Saint Beasts</b></u></h2><p>The next time that Yusuke and Kurama would cross paths would be in his third mission from the Spirit World as Detective, he would go to defeat the Four Beasts that were making all of the world sick and give a vile infection to humans that would eventually just turn them into demons where they would attempt to murder and slaughter everyone around them that wasn't inflicted with the demonic plague. Kurama and Hiei were actually bargained with a pardon for their crimes if they were to assist Yusuke Urameshi in this mission, as they knew that he couldn't do it as he was with his strength, even with his partner Kuwabara, so, the two demons gladly accepted the deal and managed to get to Yusuke and his friend in the nick of time, killing some lesser demons that had ganged up on them before the castle ahead. When they arrived in the building, however, they were met with a very violent surprise.</p><h2>Youko Story</h2><p>Youko Kurama is a five-tailed fox demon who was a fugitive from Makai. He was a thief back then, a good one. One day, he was being hunted and he got injured; his situation was very hostile. Fortunately, he found a way to survive. He turned into a spirit and managed to escape from the hunters. His spirit flew to Ningenkai and managed to possess the body of an unborn child in a woman's womb. When the child was born, he was given the name Shuichi Minamino and was loved and cherished by his mother, Shiori. Shiori's husband died shortly after Shuichi was born. His true purpose of staying in Ningenkai was to recover his strength for mostly 10 years. But 15 years had passed and still, he's still with Shiori. He can't bear to leave his human mother after all she had done for him. Shuichi stayed and took care of her especially in times when she needs him.</p><p>Shuichi unexpectedly turned back as a youko during the Ankoku Bujutsukai. This was the time when his youko side was introduced. This was made possible by Uraurashima's curse that should have made Shuichi a helpless child, but instead he turned into a youko: his original form. He went back to his human form after their match.</p><p>At the time when Yusuke died for the second time, Shuichi transformed into his youko form by himself as a result of his vengeful spirit.</p><p>His third and final transformation was during his match with Sigure at the Makai tournament. But Kurama decided to turn into his human form to defeat Sigure for personal reasons.</p><p>Kuronue is Youko Kurama's late comrade. He was introduced in the second movie of Yu Yu Hakusho. He was Kurama's companion every time he makes a move as a thief. Kuronue died while he tried to retrieve his necklace that was very important to him. He jumped into a deep hole underground and he was attacked by razor sharp bamboos. Kurama could not do anything but to save himself , and so he left him. Do not take it the wrong way. He also mourned for the loss of his friend.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Kurama is cool, calm and collected for a majority if the time he is shown in Yuyu Hakusho, and proves that he is indeed an extremely capable fighter. Hiei even states during the course of Kurama's first battle in the series against Genbu of the Four Saint Beasts that he would much rather fight with him than against him, something that alarmed Kuwabara as Hiei was a lightning quick swordsman and famous for the amount of power he could conjure up with his flame based techniques. Kurama uses plants to fight most of his enemies, and definitely doesn't fall under the generic stereotype of being all around nearly useless for fighting. Kurama has proven that he is indeed a front line fighter and, though very much reliable on tactics to win his fights, he is also just as capable a fighter as Yusuke and Kuwabara and Hiei, though his plant minions generally do the work. A majority of his fighting style as Youko Kurama relies on illusions and having his plants fight for him, often in a parasitic way. His main weapon is not those plants, however, as he actually bases his fighting style off of the Rose Whip that he has hidden in his hair. This tactic is probably to convince people that he is somewhat physically weak as a fighter by coming off with pinkish clothing and a fragile body structure, or so it would seem. He has shown that in the end, despite his human qualities and caring, he can still most definitely be as ruthless as a demon, showing that when push came to shove he was willing to kill anyone, even a small child as shown in the Black Chapter saga. However, he is also a serious avenger, as in the very next chapter he killed the opponent he had to face that put him into a position that he would have to kill the child. This was one of the few instances where he was actually shown to have any emotion other than kindness, going into a brutal rage, but then, the mind reading opponent he faced was confused as his thoughts went silent, showing that he is able to avoid telepathy.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Kurama when introduced his significantly depowered due to the Spirit Defense Force nearly killing him, but he has retained his abiltiy to manipulate plants, especially his trademarl rose whip. His abilites continue to grow and start to reach their former glory once he takes the form of Yoko Kurama due to the effects of the Idon Box. By the end of the series Kurama in his full demon form is an Upper S-Class appartion and one of the strongest demons in demon world.</p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Astral Projection - In the manga Kurama is able to separate his astral form from his body to enter the Spirit World.</p><p>Bamboo Forest - Kurama takes a plant and changes that into a spear like bamboo shoot which he launches into the ground. Then dozens upon dozens of Bamboo spears shoot up from the ground to impale any targets around Kurama.</p><p>Binding Fist of the Demonic Vine - Similar to the Rose Whip though a Sword variant. This technique twist the vines around Kurama's arm to form a blade. Only usable as Yoko Kurama</p><p>Bloodsucking Plant - A last ditch effort attack, The blood sucking plant uses Kurama's life force to activate and attaches itself to his opponent where it then sucks out the opponents blood and blossoms over their body.</p><p>Death Tree - A rooted plant that ends in many carniverous mouths that secrete acidic saliva that can melt flesh and bone with ease. This planet was used to interrogate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46057\" href=\"/ura-urashima/4005-46057/\" slug=\"ura-urashima\">Ura Urashima</a>. Only usable as Yoko Kurama</p><p>Floating Leaf - Kurama summons the leaf of a plant on his back to act as a glider. The wings were mistaken by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46086\" href=\"/kazuma-kuwabara/4005-46086/\" slug=\"kazuma-kuwabara\">Kuwabara</a> as butterfly wings.</p><p>Lamp Weed - A marker plant that Kurama uses to keep track of where he has gone.</p><p>Leaf Blade - As word blade formed from a leaf, Kurama used this before he was strong enough to create his Rose Whip.</p><p>Parrot Grass - A talking grass used to confuse a group of religous zealots in Spirit World.</p><p>Petals and Thorns - Kurama uses rose petals to form a barrier around himself. When an enemy gets to close the petals act as razor blades and rip apart anyone. This move is used to take out weaker demons or to keep higher ones at bay.</p><p>Pseudo-Creature - A plant that combines with a host on a cellular level. This plant instinctively heals all damage to the host as long as the brain is still intact. This was given to Hiei so he could present Mukuro with the gift of her former tormentor.</p><p>Ojigi Plant - A plant indigenous to South America. When grown with demon energy, it mutates into a creature that responds to movements or heat by closing its leaves around its prey and crushing it to death. This plant was used in the Dark Tournament to battle <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46052\" href=\"/karasu/4005-46052/\" slug=\"karasu\">Karasu</a>. Only usable as Yoko Kurama</p><p>Rose Whip - Formed from a seed that Kurama keeps in his hair, this is his most used and trademarked weapon. The whip is sharp enough to slice through stone and Kurama is very skilled in its use.</p><p>Seed of the Death Plant - Kurama will sow this seed into his opponents body and after it gestates for some time it will erupt from thier body immobilizing them and killing them instantly. Kurama once placed the plant into his own body to serve as an impromptu blade during his fight with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46229\" href=\"/toya/4005-46229/\" slug=\"toya\">Toya</a> and successfully used this plant top kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46253\" href=\"/roto/4005-46253/\" slug=\"roto\">Roto</a>.</p><p>Sinning Tree - A plant that grasps it user in tendrils and then feeds their mind illusions based on their fears, showing them wicked and disturbing images. The tree will not stop until the host is dead. This was used to ensnare Elder Toguro who, since he is immortal, is now trapped for all eternity.</p><p>Smokescreen - Kurama is able to emit a smokescreen from his sleeves in order to blind his opponents and cover his own movements.</p><p>Thorn Wheel - Kurama spins the rose whip around his waist and emits a deadly energy attack all around him. This attack is perfect for taking out groups of weaker demons.</p>",

Her bank was very successful.  <br /><h2>Creation</h2> Ilain was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-28136\" href=\"/robert-jordan/4040-28136/\">Robert Jordan</a> for his book series <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, making her first appearance in the prequel, <i>New Spring</i>. She made her first appearance in comics in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-20363\" href=\"/wheel-of-time-new-spring/4050-20363/\">Wheel of Time: New Spring</a> #5, written by Jordan and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41486\" href=\"/chuck-dixon/4040-41486/\">Chuck Dixon</a> and illustrated by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-6763\" href=\"/mike-miller/4040-6763/\">Mike Miller</a>    <br /><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>New Spring</h3>A man pretending to be a member of the Tower Guard approaches Ilain with what he claims is a document signed by the Amyrlin Seat <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49346\" href=\"/tamra-ospenya/4005-49346/\">Tamra Ospenya</a> ordering Ilain to reveal the details of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28306\" href=\"/moiraine-damodred/4005-28306/\">Moiraine Damodred's</a> accounts to him. Ilain sees through the ruse and has the man imprisoned, though he manages to escape after bribing one of her employees. Her reaction to this betrayal is suitably harsh. When Moiraine next comes to the bank, Ilain tells her of the affair and assures her that her assets are safe in the bank.  <br /><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Literature</h3><b><i>The Wheel of Time</i></b>  <br />Ilain was originally created for the <i>Wheel of Time</i> series of books. She has thus far appeared in one book in the series.",

    "description": "<p>Halcyon managed to impress the Queen of the Third Race Titania during her \"brief\" divorce from Oberon and the two fell in love and were married. They were soon blessed with a child who they named Fox.</p> <p>The marriage fell apart when Titania grew tired of Halcyon's rigid sense of right and wrong. Halcyon was devastated again when his daughter Fox became a relationship with David Xanatos, a man who Halcyon considered amoral. During this time Halcyon contracted a terminal disease.</p> <p>Fortress one was a design of Halcyon's that Xanatos had destroyed by the Gargoyles when they were temporarily in his employ. When Halcyon got around to building Fortress two, the gargoyles as an act of penance decided to safeguard the airship on its first voyage. Halcyon perceived them as a threat and captured Goliath. Halcyon managed to convince Goliath to take responsibility for his part in the destruction of Fortress one and the two became allies and defeated Fox who had tried to sabotage the maiden flight of Fortress two.  Halcyon later attempted to place his soul in the body of the Golem of Prague as he didn't want to die. He was convinced by Goliath that this was wrong and he should accept his fate.</p> <p>Halcyon was one of the foremost defenders of his grandson Alexander Xanatos when Oberon tried to abduct him.</p>",

Wishing to see the outside world, she fled the Heliopic Brotherhood of Ra. She then was found by the Oannes Society, and kept at their headquarters on an otherwise uninhabited island. The Oannes Society believed her to be the water goddess Naunet.

After the revolt failed, the three were sentenced to one hundred years of hard labor. Some time later, when it became apparent that Fabletown would soon fall under attack, the three volunteered to join the defense, hoping to demonstrate their new loyalty. They fought bravely, but Papa Bear was badly injured and Boo was slain by enemy fire in the closing stages of the battle. Boo's body was committed to the depths of the Witching Well along with his fallen comrades, watched by his grieving parents. With the popular story requiring three bears, Mama Bear fell pregnant not long after her son's death and a new Baby Bear now completes the family once more. Boo Bear was among the ghosts who accompanied Flycatcher to Haven.    </p>",

Some time later, when it became apparent that Fabletown would soon fall under attack, the three volunteered to join the defense, hoping to demonstrate their new loyalty. They fought bravely, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46021\" href=\"/papa-bear/4005-46021/\">Papa Bear </a>was badly injured and Boo was slain by enemy fire in the closing stages of the battle. Boo's body was committed to the depths of the Witching Well along with his fallen comrades, watched by his grieving parents. With the popular story requiring three bears, she soon fell pregnant not long after her son's death and a new Baby Bear now completes the family once more. </p>",

Reynard the Fox overheard the plan and took it upon himself to warn Snow. He had to face such enemies as <a href=\"/bagheera/4005-46027/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46027\">Bagheera</a> and <a href=\"/shere-khan/4005-46028/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46028\">Shere Khan</a> from the Junglebook and has expressed his affections towards Snow. Snow did not understand why Reynard felt he could call her \"Sweetie\" or think he could have a chance with her. Reynard told her that everyone knew she was \"bumping headboards\" with <a href=\"/bigby-wolf/4005-7266/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7266\">Bigby Wolf</a> since Remembrance Day.

During preparations for Bigby and Snow's home, Reynard admits to <a href=\"/prince-charming/4005-5961/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5961\">Prince Charming</a> his anger towards him. When he asks why, Reynard explains if Prince Charming had kept his promise for glamour spells, he could have become a human and swept Snow off her feet. Charming, not wanting to be reminded of his broken promises, tells him to leave him alone.

From an early age he could see and interact with the spirit world, like Kuwabara, though he could destroy demons and spirits as a small child. His training as the spirit detective of Earth made him even stronger and he was able to kill most demons with little effort. After witnessing the Black Black Clubs brutality Sensui's psyche broke into seven personalities that could manifest due to certain needs or traumas. Sensui went into hiding and trained for a long time in order to destroy the humans that plague the world. He mastered techniques in 6 years that would normally take 40 years of discipline. Sensui's personal fighting style involves blocking hits using his arms while countering with kicks.</p><p><b>Signature Moves</b></p><p><b>Resshun Ko Kyu Ha:</b> Shinobu Sensui's variation of the Spirit Gun, Sensui forms a purple energy ball and kicks that at his opponent. This is referred to martial arts style and spirit power combined.</p><p><b>Splinter Resshuken</b>: Generating a field of energy Sensui makes a small minefield of energy blasts that converge into a single ball, which Sensui promptly kicks causing a barrage of blasts that track an opponent.</p><p><b>Sacred Energy:</b> The highest from of energy that surpasses both spirit and demon energy that requires 40+ years of discipline and training to achieve. The sacred Energy allows Sensui to fly under his own power which is how he got the nickname Black Angel</p><p><b>Sacred Energy Armor:</b> The sacred energy manifested into armor that has two forms. One for offense and one for defense though both are an increase from Sensui's normal use of the energy</p><p><b>Twisted Twister:</b> Sensui counters an opponent with a kick that creates a twister of energy which traps his opponent while sacred energy slashes at them.</p>",

    "deck": "Toguro Ototo is a character from the manga/anime Yu Yu Hakusho. He was once a human and lover of Genkai but after winning the dark tournament he asked to be turned into a demon.",
    "description": "<p>Toguro Ototo is the younger brother of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46050\" href=\"/toguro-ani/4005-46050/\" slug=\"toguro-ani\">Toguro Ani</a>, and lover of the psychic <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46197\" href=\"/genkai/4005-46197/\" slug=\"genkai\">Genkai</a>. During his youth he became world famous as a demon killer, something that brought young men from around the globe to train under him. However this was short lived as they were all slaughtered by a demon named Kairen while he was away to force him and his teammates into the Dark Tournament as the Tournament's wild card team. He then prepared for the Dark Tournament by retreating into the wilderness where he lived for 3 months while training, returning to his team the day before the Dark Tournament. Team Toguro eventually worked their way through to the Finals,where in the final match Toguro killed Kairen,and he and his brother utilized their wishes to become demons themselves. For the next 50 years the Toguro Brothers worked as hired guns and battled multiple demons such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46051\" href=\"/bui/4005-46051/\" slug=\"bui\">Bui</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46052\" href=\"/karasu/4005-46052/\" slug=\"karasu\">Karasu</a> sparing them to allow them to become stronger for a future rematch.</p><p>The Toguro Brothers eventually have a battle with Spirit Detective <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45374\" href=\"/yusuke-urameshi/4005-45374/\" slug=\"yusuke-urameshi\">Yusuke Urameshi</a> and his ally <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46086\" href=\"/kazuma-kuwabara/4005-46086/\" slug=\"kazuma-kuwabara\">Kazuma Kuwabara</a>, after the Brothers are hired by Tarukane to ensure the ice apparition <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46481\" href=\"/yukina/4005-46481/\" slug=\"yukina\">Yukina</a> continues crying for the valuable diamonds her tears form. This leads to a fight between the two teams, with the older Toguro Brother becoming weapons for his younger brothers fight, but eventually he falls to their teamwork. After everyone clears the Mansion they awaken revealing they threw the fight so their true employer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46485\" href=\"/sakyo/4005-46485/\" slug=\"sakyo\">Sakyo</a> could collect bigger winnings,before Toguro murders Tarukane on Sakyoa's orders.Toguro then confronts Yusuke outside of his school forcing him to follow him before showing him 60% of his true power, leaving Yusuke completely terrified. He then threatens Yusuke into competing in the upcoming Dark Tournament,which Yusuke reluctantly accept with the two departing without a problem. He then meets with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45993\" href=\"/yoko-kurama/4005-45993/\" slug=\"yoko-kurama\">Kurama</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45368\" href=\"/hiei/4005-45368/\" slug=\"hiei\">Hiei</a> informing them of their participation on <a data-ref-id=\"4060-46145\" href=\"/team-urameshi/4060-46145/\" slug=\"team-urameshi\">Team Urameshi</a>.</p><p>Upon Hanging Neck Island, Younger Toguro would frequently fight his team's battles on his own. While acting as the bodyguard for his employer Sakyo, defending him when the Tournament Committee learned of his plan to open a portal between Earth and the Demon World. This forces Toguro to murder the demon enforcers and the Tournament Committee themselves.Following this he skips his teams semi-final match to have a death match with the depowered Genki,culminating in him killing her. However he proves remorseful urging <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46278\" href=\"/koenma/4005-46278/\" slug=\"koenma\">Koenma</a> to care for her body so she could be revived after the tournament's end. Shortly after the final match of the tournament arrives with Toguro battling Yusuke, and quickly dominating the younger fighter in battle.However he refuses to strike a killing blow on several occasions as he felt Yusuke wasn't using his true power, however this ends when Genki possesses <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75203\" href=\"/pu/4005-75203/\" slug=\"pu\">Pu</a>, and instructs Toguro to murder a member of Team Urameshi to break down the emotional walls Yusuke has put up and draw out his true power. He then attacks Kuwabara, making Yusuke believe his best friend to be dead,unleashing his power.Their battle then reaches it's end where each uses the majority of their spirit energy, however Toguro exhausts his life force alongside it killing him and leaving his body a shriveled husk.</p><p>Upon his death he is brought to Spirit World where Koenme offers him a light sentence, that he refuses instead opting for 10,000 years in the deepest depths of hell.Upon his journey to the gates he is met by the spirit of a young Genki, who attempts to dissuade him from his self imposed punishment.But to no avail as he enters the gates as he leaves Genki with the message to watch after Yusuke, and about how beautiful their lives together could have been together.</p>",

The wild card Team Toguro eventually came out the victors, but Elder and Younger Toguro used their prize to be turned into demons. Elder Toguro then gained the ability of near instant regeneration, shape shifting, and longevity. The two then became demonic mercenaries, working for the highest bidder and eventually coming to work <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46485\" href=\"/sakyo/4005-46485/\" slug=\"sakyo\">Sakyo</a>. In the present day he,his brother and the Apparition Gang were bought by crime boss Tarukane to ensure his prisoner the captured <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46481\" href=\"/yukina/4005-46481/\" slug=\"yukina\">Yukina</a>, would continue to cry and produce diamonds for their employer. The two brothers were then drawn into a battle with her rescuers Spirit Detective <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45374\" href=\"/yusuke-urameshi/4005-45374/\" slug=\"yusuke-urameshi\">Yusuke Urameshi</a> and his friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46086\" href=\"/kazuma-kuwabara/4005-46086/\" slug=\"kazuma-kuwabara\">Kazuma Kuwabara</a>,in a battle which the Elder Toguro shapeshifted into weapons for his younger sibling. After the battle ends in the presumed death of the Toguros, they rise after the Black Black Club end transmission revealing to Tarukane their true allegiance lies with Sakyo,who had them fake their loss to gain Tarukane's fortune. They then kill Tarukane, and Younger Toguro delivers the invitation for Yusuke and his friends to attend the Dark Tournament as the Tournament's wildcard.</p><p>Elder Toguro's first battle is against Team Gorenja in the Semi-Finals, during which he battles the three surviving team members at once. He quickly kills them by utilizing his stretching, and enjoys playing a mind game with the team. He then fought Kuwabara in the final round, during which he dominated their fight. However he eventually loses when Kuwabara utilizes the Trial Sword,to shape his Spirit Energy to completely squash his opponent.Kuwabara is then declared the victor, and all presume Elder Toguro to now be deceased, however before the start of the final match between Younger Toguro and Yusuke Urameshi he revives in the ring's center. He reveals he had liquefied before his vital organs could be crushed, and offers to act as weapons for his brother in their final battle. However because of his harsh words about the late Genkai, Younger Toguro sends him flying with a mighty kick off Hanging Neck Island.He is later found following the end of the Tournament by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46047\" href=\"/shinobu-sensui/4005-46047/\" slug=\"shinobu-sensui\">Sensui</a>,who brings him back with him for use in his plan. As little more then a head he is kept by Sensui in a tank filled with water while he regenerates but upon the orders of Sensui, he is eaten by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58010\" href=\"/sensui-seven/4060-58010/\" slug=\"sensui-seven\">Sensui Seven</a> member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75212\" href=\"/sadao-makihara/4005-75212/\" slug=\"sadao-makihara\">Gourmet</a>.However after being eaten he managed to take possession of Gourmet's body and his powers and ate the telepathy Mutora gaining his telepathy, and later participating in the kidnapping of Kuwabara for Sensui's plan. As Gourment he is the first line of defense to stop the heroes from freeing Kuwabara, during which he uses his telepathy to read Kurama's mind angering him. He then squares off with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45993\" href=\"/yoko-kurama/4005-45993/\" slug=\"yoko-kurama\">Kurama</a>,who promptly decapitates him with his Rose Whip who realized Gourment was in fact Toguro.He then used the Sinning Tree to immobilize Elder Toguro, leaving him in a constant halucogenic state for all of eternity with no chance to escape.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Following his teams win during the Dark Tournament 50 years ago, Elder Toguro utilized his wish to become a demon. After becoming a demon he gained the ability to manipulate his body for a variety of effects,including shapeshifting into various weapons, stretching and massive regeneration. He was also unable to be killed, as he was able to shift his vital organs to any spot on his body, unless they were all destroyed at once. Following the second Dark Tournament, he was rescued by Shinobu Sensui, who fed the still heavily damaged Toguro to Gourmet effectively allowing him to gain Gourmet's body and his power to gain others powers including telepathy gained by devouring one of the psychics. After this he revealed that he was now unable to be killed, as his regeneration had increased.</p>",

He then prepares for the kill, but instead is killed by a plant from Kurama piercing his heart.However despite his death, he gave Team Toguro their first victory as Kurami remained on the ground for over ten seconds.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Karasu would utilize his demonic energy to create invisible explosives as his typical offense. He could utilize these in several variations such as tracers which follow an opponent or hidden traps which explode.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Shishiwakamaru was one of the semi finalists in the Dark Tournemane t and probably the only member of his team to actually belong. His high C-Class energy allowed him to even gain a little respect from Kurama and Hiei. His main power involves using his Banshee Shriek sword to summon souls of long dead demons to attack his opponent. Shishi is an able swordsman who shows much more grace with a blade than Kuwabara though nowhere near what Hiei is capable of. After training with Genkai Shishi gains low S-Class power and was powerful enough to get past the preliminary's of the Makai tournament. <br/><b>Signature Moves  <br/>Cape of No Return:</b> By using his cape Shishi can transport weaker opponents to a random destination in one of the three worlds. The random destination seems to be set per person since thus attack was used on Kuwabara twice and he was transported to the same place both times.<br/><b>Shrill Call of the Reaper:</b> A sonic attack activated when Shishi twirls the sord above his head. This usually makes weaker demons drop to their knees in ear splitting pain. Shishi stated that the weakest of souls would be stolen from their hosts though this never happened. <br/><b>Chorus of a Thousand Skulls:</b> The true power of the Banshee Shriek, Shishi is able to call demon souls into the ring to attack j\\his opponents. The souls thhemsevles are pretty random and will attack mostly anyone in sight. <br/><b>Chorus of Ten Thousand Skulls: </b>A more powerful version where Shishi can beckon even more souls than before and has an easier time controlling them. <br/><b>Cage of Hell: </b>By stabbing the Banshee Shriek into the ground Shishi can surround him and his opponent with this cage made from the disembodied cries of the dead.",
