This young mutant Jesse's powers enable him to mimic the appearances and emotions of those he was in proximity of, and at the time was in the form of a young girl named Jessie. Jessie, as a mutant, was also a priority for <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier</a> of the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> and he sends <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> to help the young child control his mutant powers. Wolverine, in turn, seeks the help of <a href=\"/typhoid-mary/4005-1536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1536\">Typhoid Mary</a> to carry out this mission. In her normal, human, 'Mary' persona, Typhoid Mary is able to enter the Fortress unperturbed, posing as a computer technician and find Jessie. However, when they try to escape, a security alert is triggered and the two are captured. Jessie transmits Mary's mental cries for help to Daredevil and Ghost Rider (although <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/vengeance/4005-14759/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14759\">Vengeance</a> shows up instead and battles Wolverine at first). Steel Raven arrives and beats Daredevil, but in the chaos, Typhoid Mary escapes with Jessie. Steel Raven is assigned a new mission to once again retrieve Jessie. She tracks down Typhoid Mary, but finds her in a new, abusive-man-hating persona: Bloody Mary, but without Jessie. As it turns out, Bloody Mary had realized Jesse was in fact a boy and not a girl, ignorant of Jesse's ability to metamorph to appear as those in his proximity. Steel Raven realizes that Mary was going on a mission of vengeance against women beaters and is sympathetic to her cause. The two team up to exact punishment on Dr. Hoffner for his cruel mistreatment of young children. Not particularly fond of what the Fortress had planned for Jesse, Steel Raven helps Mary escape by stalling Wolverine and essentially ignores her mission to recapture Jesse.</p><h3>New Genix</h3><p>Steel Raven at one time also aids in training <a href=\"/new-genix/4060-56308/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56308\">New Genix</a>, a team of superhumans kids who are brainwashed by the Fortress into believing they are living in the 31st century.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Steel Raven is highly conditioned and physically fit and possessed high levels of stamina, fitness, and fighting skills, both of an armed and unarmed nature. A proficient sharpshooter, Steel Raven has access to an arsenal of high tech weapons and often carries a selection of blades, knives, bola, pistols, machine guns, rifles, shurikens, throwing blades, and explosives on her. She also is known to use an energy bola which can shock opponents into a neutralized state. Steel Raven is considerably wealthy.</p><p><b>Physical Characteristics</b></p><p>Height: 5' 10\"</p><p>Weight: 127 lbs</p><p>Hair: Blonde</p><p>Eyes: Blue</p>",

Solusandra also created seven <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43023\" href=\"/altwaals-weapons/4055-43023/\" slug=\"altwaals-weapons\">weapons of power</a>, which were made exclusively for him. After being explained the reasons for his existence, Solusandra created an entire race of beings so that Altwaal would not be bored. These beings named themselves the First because Solusandra left their home planet of Elysia almost immediately after they were created. This gave the First the impression that they had created themselves, and as such, were the true gods of the universe. Altwaal allowed them to believe this, for he felt they needed to grow and mature naturally to really be of value to the universe. Because Altwaal was the first of The First he was by far, the most powerful. There were however, six members of the First who held more power than all others, but less than Altwaal. These six First were; <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13246\" href=\"/ingra/4005-13246/\" slug=\"ingra\">Ingra</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13265\" href=\"/trenin/4005-13265/\" slug=\"trenin\">Trenin</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13245\" href=\"/gannish/4005-13245/\" slug=\"gannish\">Gannish</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13244\" href=\"/pyrem/4005-13244/\" slug=\"pyrem\">Pyrem</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13248\" href=\"/orium/4005-13248/\" slug=\"orium\">Orium</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13255\" href=\"/yala/4005-13255/\" slug=\"yala\">Yala</a>. Soon after their creation, however, the Age of Wars occurred, but was eventually stopped by Altwaal. The First then lead a peaceful existence until some members became dissatisfied with their way of life and wished for Altwaal to step down as leader in order for a council to rule instead. Those who wished this to happen thought a council would be better able to represent all of their race. The First often debated this subject for hours at a time until an assassination attempt was made on Altwaal himself, by the Goddess known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42962\" href=\"/tulity/4005-42962/\" slug=\"tulity\">Tulity</a>. However, the bolt that was meant for Altwaal struck and killed his only confirmed lover, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42960\" href=\"/raamia/4005-42960/\" slug=\"raamia\">Raamia</a>. Stricken with grief, Altwaal defied the law of nature to bring Raamia back to life, which outraged many members of the First, and ultimately lead to their second civil war. During their war, the First not only damaged their home planet of Elysia, but they also managed to destroy an entire world when they took their war across the universe. This outraged Altwaal and he ultimately ended the war by forcing the members of the First into two different camps which were based on their ancient alliances. He then forced them to choose to either stay where they had been placed, or switch sides before he ultimately created the Eidolon Rift which divided <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43027\" href=\"/elysia/4020-43027/\" slug=\"elysia\">Elysia</a> into two houses, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41581\" href=\"/house-sinister/4060-41581/\" slug=\"house-sinister\">House Sinister</a>, whose members place themselves before all others, and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41582\" href=\"/house-dexter/4060-41582/\" slug=\"house-dexter\">House Dexter</a>, whose members place all others before themselves. Altwaal then decided to place himself in a self-imposed exile, hoping that the First would grow without him, and ultimately realise that they were stronger when together. However, before he left, Altwaal cursed Orium with true sight for not being able to see the end result of his revolt against actions. This caused Orium to see the truth in all of his visions, which ultimately drove him insane. Altwaal then gave <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13251\" href=\"/persha/4005-13251/\" slug=\"persha\">Persha</a>, Ingra's newborn child the gift of fire, and then gave <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13249\" href=\"/seahn/4005-13249/\" slug=\"seahn\">Seahn</a>, the newborn child of Tulity, the gift of earth. He did this in hopes of giving them extra power so that one of them may reunite their people. He then permanently left Elysia in order to hide as Ayden on the planet Quin. Although all members of the First believed him to be dead, only Pyrem and Raamia knew the truth. It seems that Pyrem was his most trusted ally and the only First with access to Altwaals armory, while Raamia, his one true love, was visited by Altwaal from time to time.<br/><br/></span> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/106266-10244-ayden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-106266\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3733333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/106266-10244-ayden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-106266\"><img alt=\"In exile as Ayden\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/106266-10244-ayden.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/106266-10244-ayden.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a><figcaption>In exile as Ayden</figcaption></figure><span>On Quin disguised as Ayden, Altwaal used his bow to kill the evil sorcerer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13182\" href=\"/mordath/4005-13182/\" slug=\"mordath\">Mordath</a>, who had attempted to conquer much of the planet. Altwaal then divided his arrow into five pieces so that it could not easily be used again. When Mordath was resurrected after receiving a sigil, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42966\" href=\"/danik/4005-42966/\" slug=\"danik\">Danik</a>, in the form of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13180\" href=\"/neven/4005-13180/\" slug=\"neven\">Neven</a>, gave Altwaals bow to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13178\" href=\"/arwyn/4005-13178/\" slug=\"arwyn\">Arwyn</a> and sent her on a quest to collect the five pieces of Altwaals arrow so that she may kill Mordath for a second time. Neven also attempts to inspire Ayden to return to his true form and use his power for good, rather than hide away in exile. He is ultimately visited by Persha when she uses his Gauntlet of Power to locate him. Here Persha asks Ayden to return to Elysia in order to reunite the First. However, he refuses her plea for help and pretends to be an old man with no idea what she is talking about. He does encourage her to try to reunite the First herself and accidentally says her name before she departs. Persha is disheartened by his lack of interest in returning to Elysia, but she does realize that she never introduced herself when she barged into his room. Altwaal then begins to revert to his true form, stating that there maybe hope for his people after all.<br/><br/>Altwaal is next seen when he is called to Elysia by Pyrem, Persha, Seahn, and Orium after they touch his obelisk. Altwaal then states how disappointed he is that they cannot end their warring ways and reunite as a people. He then simply slams his hands together forcing the Eidolon rift to dissipate. While he begins to speak to the First now gathering in front of him, Seahn demands a duel, stating that Altwaal cannot simply return and just expect to lead unchallenged. However Seahn is struck in the back by Persha and seemingly kills him. Unfortunately, Altwaal makes an example of Persha by appearing to kill her as well, stating that there can be no more fighting between the members of the First. He then calls for every First on Elysia to gather and prepare for the war with the Negation universe. <br/><br/></span><span>Soon afterwards <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13205\" href=\"/evinlea/4005-13205/\" slug=\"evinlea\">Evinlea</a> arrives, now on the side of the Negation, leading the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-53136\" href=\"/lawbringers/4060-53136/\" slug=\"lawbringers\">Lawbringers</a> to Elysia. The lawbringer known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13217\" href=\"/qztr/4005-13217/\" slug=\"qztr\">Qztr</a> quickly kills Raamia for a second time after telling Evinlea not interupt Altwaals glorius return. This causes an enraged Altwaal to brutally attack Qztr as the rest of the Lawbringers poor out of a portal created by Evinlea.</span><span>The next issue would have seen a full out war between the First and the Negation's Lawbringers, however the series was abruptly canceled after Crossgen was forced to file for bankruptcy. It was revealed by the creators of the story however, that Altwaal's sudden return was due to time constraints on the story, and had the war been able to finish, he would have been among many of the First to die.<br/><br/> <h2>Power and Status</h2>Altwaal is the initial member of the First, and as such, he is  by far the most powerful member of this species. As a member of this race of beings, he is privileged with a wide variety of powers <span>which includes, but is not limited to; super strength, speed, self propelled flight, single or mass teleportation, extra sensory perception, object and sentient life creation, magic, the ability to control a number of energy types in a variety of ways, regeneration, telepathy, empathy, and the ability to survive in the vacuum of space without the need for food, water, or oxygen. Altwaal is also the only member of the First who has been shown to have enough power to bring other members of the First back to life. He is also the creator of the Eidolon Rift, which divided the planet of Elysia for centuries, making it difficult for other members of the First to traverse from one side of the planet to the other. Altwaal is the only member of the First who was able to single handedly create and destroy the rift. <br/><br/>Altwaal's status among his people is also clearly shown, as he is the only other member of the First, who's name is used as a colloquialism. His name is often used by all members of the First in a variety of situtations, making him a \"God among the Gods\".</span></span>",

As Aiko (a name that translates to \"patronage or favor\"), she first encountered Batman when she was sent to Gotham City to handle an Intergang stoolie. Brenner demonstrated incredible strength and fast reflexes when she confronted the Dark Knight. A trained fighter, she managed to go toe-to-toe with the Batman, resulting in a draw during their first confrontation. When his next mission took him to Japan, Batman encountered Aiko a second time, where he manipulated her into ending the life of a deviant criminal who liked cosplay (costumed role playing). Aiko unfortunately proved an embarrassment to her superiors, and her ultimate fate went unrecorded.</p>",

    "deck": "Ervulsh is a member of the race of god-like beings known as the First and he sits on the Sinister High Council.",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Ervulsh is one of the most powerful members of his race due to the fact that he sits on <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41581\" href=\"/house-sinister/4060-41581/\" slug=\"house-sinister\">House Sinister's</a> High Council. Positions on this council are fought for and only seat the most powerful. His name is derived from the word revulsion and this word is supposed to govern his personality. This seems accurate as Ervulsh is one of the few members of the First who chooses not to make his physical appearance attractive because that is simply \"not who he is\". Although Ervulsh serves on House Sinisters Council, he also rules a planet so far from the center of the universe that very little universal energy could be accessed here. However, he had developed an intricate webbing system that drained power from this planet directly to him, making it difficult for him to be defeated if other members of the First attempted to fight him there. Ervulsh was first seen in the series when he and the rest of the council give a portion of their power to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13246\" href=\"/ingra/4005-13246/\" slug=\"ingra\">Ingra</a> in order to further her latest plot. Ervulsh later helped <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13248\" href=\"/orium/4005-13248/\" slug=\"orium\">Orium</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13249\" href=\"/seahn/4005-13249/\" slug=\"seahn\">Seahn</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42955\" href=\"/braag/4005-42955/\" slug=\"braag\">Braag</a> when he agreed to keep Ingra captive on his planet so that Ingra could not quickly regain her power. When Ingra questioned why he had helped to overthrow her, Ervulsh professed that he only agreed because he was in love with Ingra and simply wanted her to become his queen. Ingra went along with this idea in order to tap into Ervulsh's power supply, restoring a portion of her own power. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13244\" href=\"/pyrem/4005-13244/\" slug=\"pyrem\">Pyrem</a> came to rescue Ingra, Ingra used what little power she had stolen from Ervulsh in an attempt to quickly defeat him and escape, however she pitied the fact that he was not as powerful as she originally suspected. This threw Ervulsh into a frenzy and he angrily tried to kill Ingra by feeding on her in a manner similar to that of a spider. Pyrem intervened just in time and began a fight with Ervulsh. The two struggled for a bit, but Ervulsh was soon over powered and Pyrem took Ingra back to <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41582\" href=\"/house-dexter/4060-41582/\" slug=\"house-dexter\">House Dexter</a>. Ervulsh was later seen when Seahn defeats the Sinister Council members in order to secure his seat in the leader's position. Ervulsh was easily defeated by Seahn due to the fact that he was still recovering from his previous battle with Pyrem. Ervulsh was not seen again before the series was abruptly canceled, due to Crossgen filing for bankruptcy.</p>",

Among her many gifts as a seer which includes, precognition and telepathy, Ihroe is capable of creating a Veil of Privacy around a small area which allows no thoughts or beings in or out without her permission. This allows the Dexter Council to plan and debate without fear of being spied on. Ihroe is the only member of the First who has demonstrated this type of power.</p><p>Ihroe is known to be able to uncover any secret and this was proven when she revealed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42962\" href=\"/tulity/4005-42962/\" slug=\"tulity\">Tulity</a> as the assassin who attempted to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42951\" href=\"/altwaal/4005-42951/\" slug=\"altwaal\">Altwaal</a>. After House Dexter was created and she became their Council Guardian, Ihroe developed an alliance with <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41581\" href=\"/house-sinister/4060-41581/\" slug=\"house-sinister\">House Sinisters</a> most gifted Seer, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13248\" href=\"/orium/4005-13248/\" slug=\"orium\">Orium</a>, who was also quite mad due in part to Altwaal's curse, which forced to him to only see the truth. Ihroe helped him by keeping his mind sane when he lost his temper, under the condition that he help her gain her one true desire. This was later revealed to be <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13249\" href=\"/seahn/4005-13249/\" slug=\"seahn\">Seahn</a>, the Secundae of House Dexter who eventually took over House Sinister by deposing Ingra. It is unknown how long Ihroe's had been in an alliance with Orium, but he was not in any rush to deliver his end of their deal although Ihroe consistently reminded him that he still had a debt to pay to her. Because Orium failed to act quickly enough, Ihroe took matters into her own hands and traveled to House Sinister where she attempted to add to her alliance by recruiting the Secundae <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13252\" href=\"/tiena/4005-13252/\" slug=\"tiena\">Tiena</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13253\" href=\"/empher/4005-13253/\" slug=\"empher\">Empher</a>. When Ihroe brought the two to Orium, explaining that the four of them could easily bring their ultimate goals to fruition, Orium became furious and attacked the trio of Gods.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/629540-scan0031.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-629540\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4358974358974\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/629540-scan0031.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-629540\"><img alt=\"Attacked by Seahn\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/629540-scan0031.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/629540-scan0031.jpg 312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" data-width=\"312\"></a><figcaption>Attacked by Seahn</figcaption></figure><p>Although he sent the Secundae back to their homes, he continued his assault on Ihroe after she scolded him about ruining a plan that she was certain would lead to success. Orium ended their alliance after this, and when she was unconscious, he teleported her to Seahn's bedroom, essentially giving Ihroe what she wanted as he felt it would also serve his needs as well. However, Ihroe awoke only to be attacked by Seahn when he found her. Seahn eventually sends Ihroe back to House Dexter wounded and in a coma. She awakes just in time to find that Elysia was under attack from their creator <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42974\" href=\"/solusandra/4005-42974/\" slug=\"solusandra\">Solusandra</a>, and that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13244\" href=\"/pyrem/4005-13244/\" slug=\"pyrem\">Pyrem</a>, House Dexter's Leader, was abdicating his throne in order to follow <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13246\" href=\"/ingra/4005-13246/\" slug=\"ingra\">Ingra.</a></p><p>Although reluctant to continue her role as the Council Guardian, Ihroe is essential in helping to decide a new leader. She explains to the Council what their options are, and how Pyrem was initially chosen. However, any debate or discussion becomes unnecessary when she mentally links all of the members of House Dexter together so that they may unanimously choose their new leader. The candidate is quickly revealed as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13251\" href=\"/persha/4005-13251/\" slug=\"persha\">Persha</a>, Pyrem's daughter, who readily accepts the role. Ihroe is among the group of First to answer the call of Altwaal when he returns and begins to prepare the First for war with the Negation universe, however this never comes to fruition as the series was abruptly canceled due to Crossgen comics being forced to file for bankruptcy.</p><h2>Power</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/629534-scan0015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-629534\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.83582089552239\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/629534-scan0015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-629534\"><img alt=\"Ihroe using her power.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7884/629534-scan0015.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/629534-scan0015.jpg 402w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7884/629534-scan0015.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ihroe using her power.\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7884/629534-scan0015.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/629534-scan0015.jpg 402w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7884/629534-scan0015.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ihroe using her power.</figcaption></figure><p>Ihroe, like all members of her race is privy to a wide range of abilities including flight, teleportation, and enhanced strength to name few. However, Ihroe has also chosen to perfect the mental aspects of her powers, as is evidenced by skills only she has been seen using. This includes her use of the Veil of Privacy and her ability to easily manipulate other beings with telepathy. Ihroe is also very gifted in the ways of precognition, which allows her to witness signs in every day life that she can use to correctly guess the outcome of future events. She is able to scan an object or person to find information that would otherwise be unknown. Ihroe also claims that she has seen sights no other members of her race have witnessed which may be accurate as she is the only other member of the First who was able to witness the being known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42966\" href=\"/danik/4005-42966/\" slug=\"danik\">Danik</a> reforming in the Eidolon Rift even though <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13251\" href=\"/persha/4005-13251/\" slug=\"persha\">Persha</a> alone was meant to see this event. Another common use of her power seen throughout the series was her ability to create a sphere of energy which she could use to spy on others. Although Ihroe seems to be very powerful and skilled the use of her abilities, she is still easily beaten by Orium and Seahn when she tries to defend herself from their attacks.</p>",

Her name is derived from the word drama and is supposed to govern her personality. She was considered young by First standards, although she was around during the first Age of Wars among her people. During her time of peace, Raamia became the only lover of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42951\" href=\"/altwaal/4005-42951/\" slug=\"altwaal\">  Altwaal</a>, the leader of the First. It was during this time that a splinter group of First's decided that Altwaal was no longer fit to lead them and that he should step down, allowing a council to lead instead. Raamia never officially stated whether she agreed with this idea, however she was quoted as saying that Altwaal was the best of the First. She was also among his closest advisers during this time. Raamia often stayed quiet at the countless debates the First partook in to discuss the change in leadership until one night she criticized her people, saying \"nothing will change if you waste your lips forming words every night, change can only come from action\". It was at this moment an assassination attempt on Altwaals life failed and killed Raamia instead. Altwaal, stricken with grief, defied the natural laws to bring Raamia back, and sent her to another planet to avoid the following wars that would occur because of this single event. Raamia also stay on this planet for some time as she was shunned by many of her people after her resurrection. After Altwaal was rumored to have been killed when creating the Eidolon Rift that split the home planet of the First, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43027\" href=\"/elysia/4020-43027/\" slug=\"elysia\">  Elysia</a>, into two Houses, Raamia chose to stay in <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41582\" href=\"/house-dexter/4060-41582/\" slug=\"house-dexter\">  House Dexter</a>.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25835/604946-raamia1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604946\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25835/604946-raamia1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604946\"><img alt=\" Raamia's death and resurrection\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/25835/604946-raamia1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25835/604946-raamia1.jpg 500w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/25835/604946-raamia1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption> Raamia's death and resurrection</figcaption></figure>  Soon after this event, Raamia was chosen as a member of House Dexter's council, and insisted that Altwaal would eventually return. Her placement on the council indicates that she is one of the wisest members of her race, as House Dexter's council is chosen by mutual consent and only seats the most wise. She also is no longer seen without two animated staves that represent Comedy and Tragedy, although they appear to be sentient when reacting to events in the story, they do not speak and play no role in the series. Readers initially learn of Raamia's death and resurrection, as well as, the  civil war that split the First in two, when she tells the it to the Secundae known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13249\" href=\"/seahn/4005-13249/\" slug=\"seahn\">  Seahn</a>. It is implied that the two of them are lovers, however, when Seahn leaves, readers are teased when she speaks to an unknown person saying \"We were just talking about you\", hinting that Altwaal still visits her from time to time. Raamia does not often act much in the politics of the First, and often seems to show more understanding of the events that occur when compared to some of her peers. For example when Seahn challenges Pyrem for leadership of House Dexter, she simply says that it is natural for the young to defy their parents and change is simply inevitable. Raamia also suspected that the First were not truly the first beings to be created in the universe, although, this may be due to her relationship with Altwaal rather than her wisdom. <br/><br/> While Raamia's overall role in the story of the First is minimal, she serves as a catalyst for the second civil war, and tells a very detailed story of the First's past. At the end of the First series, Raamia is killed again by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-53136\" href=\"/lawbringers/4060-53136/\" slug=\"lawbringers\">  Lawbringe</a>r known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13217\" href=\"/qztr/4005-13217/\" slug=\"qztr\">  Qztr</a> when the First prepare to go to war with the Negation. However, it is not know whether Altwaal was able to resurrect her for a second time, although this is unlikely as he was rumored to be killed in the following battle. The issues containing this information were never released as the series was abruptly canceled after Crossgen Comics filed for bankruptcy.<br/><br/><h2>Power</h2>Raamia is a member of the First, and as such is privy to a wide range of abilities including immortality, regeneration, energy control, flight, and teleportation to name a few. However, Raamia very rarely demonstrates the use of any of her powers during the series. Although she may be a weaker member of the First, as she has stated that she was considered young by her peoples standards, and age is one of the determining factors of a First's power.",

    "deck": "Deren Beq is a member of Sephie's Pirates of the Wind, and is Sephie's self-appointed protector.",
    "description": "<b>Childhood in Anheim</b><p>Deren Beq grew up in the underground city of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43052\" href=\"/anheim/4020-43052/\" slug=\"anheim\"> Anheim</a>. As a young girl, she was quite fond of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43245\" href=\"/turos/4005-43245/\" slug=\"turos\"> Turos</a> and Ideria of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42971\" href=\"/meridian/4020-42971/\" slug=\"meridian\"> Meridian</a>, and they treated her like their own daughter. Deren aspired to be an artist like Ideria, and was given the gift of a sketchbook and art supplies before the young couple departed Anheim.</p><p>Ideria was pregnant with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13193\" href=\"/sephie/4005-13193/\" slug=\"sephie\"> Sephie</a>, and departed from Anheim for Meridian. Ideria passed away before she was ever able to visit Anheim again, and Turos himself never returned after the passing of his wife.</p> Over the years, Deren entered the rough and tumble world of the mining community that existed above the underground city. In time, she rose to be the owner and bartender of the community's tavern, *The Lair.* In her late teens and early twenties, she was a bright and happy young woman, and stole the heart of every man who met her. One day she met a boy who finally stole hers, and she thought her life complete. She was happier than she had ever been, until he flew away on an airship to find adventure. In her pain and anger, Deren destroyed her sketchbook, and vowed to never give herself to another man for the rest of her life.<p><br/><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p><b>Adulthood in <i>The Lair</i></b></p> Hardened by her failed romance, Deren threw herself into learning how to fight, quickly becoming the most skilled brawler in the mining community. As owner of the *The Lair,* Deren often allow bar fights to break out, so that she could prove and assert her prowess by clearing the floor all by herself. Being a citizen of the secret city of Anheim below, Deren also became their liaison to the surface world, and protector of access to its hidden entrance.<p>Members of the surrounding logging communities often came to Deren's tavern for refreshment after a long week of working the forest. One day, the logger <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42965\" href=\"/cotson/4005-42965/\" slug=\"cotson\"> Cotson</a> and his friends <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43039\" href=\"/hondell/4005-43039/\" slug=\"hondell\"> Hondell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43040\" href=\"/daneyn/4005-43040/\" slug=\"daneyn\"> Daneyn</a> come to the community, bringing a new acquaintance along with them, Sephie of Meridian.</p><p>Sephie enters The Lair in the midst of yet another tavern brawl, but this is one that Deren seems to actually have a bit of trouble controlling. Sephie literally flies into action, using her powers to surprise and separate the mob. Sephie immediately becomes an inspiring figure, and many who see and listen to her come to believe that they can shake the chains of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42988\" href=\"/ilahn/4005-42988/\" slug=\"ilahn\"> Ilahn</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42972\" href=\"/cadador/4020-42972/\" slug=\"cadador\"> Cadador</a> control.</p><p>Deren, for her part, is also intrigued, and so are the members of Anheim's city council. Deren arranges for Sephie to be \"kidnapped\" to the city below, and introduced to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43051\" href=\"/geres/4005-43051/\" slug=\"geres\"> Geres</a>, the city's Minister. While Sephie and her logger friends travel below and learn of the wonders of Anheim, Deren clean up her tavern and follows soon after.</p><p>Once below, Deren learns more about Sephie's powers and her quest to free Meridian and the rest of Demetria from Ilahn's clutches. Deren is also fascinated to learn that Sephie is the daughter of her long-lost friends Turos and Ideria. Along with Geres of Anheim, his grandson <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43041\" href=\"/crenner/4005-43041/\" slug=\"crenner\"> Crenner</a>, and Deren, Sephie makes plans to move back into the surface world and begin loosening Ilahn's control. Meanwhile, the loggers and miners Sephie has met and inspired have been working alongside the citizens of Anheim to construct a beautiful airship, one designed by Sephie's own father.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p><b><a data-ref-id=\"4060-42964\" href=\"/pirates-of-the-wind/4060-42964/\" slug=\"pirates-of-the-wind\"> Pirates of the Wind</a></b></p> Taking the ship, Sephie is joined by Deren and some of the logger and miners as they begin to take on Ilahn's forces directly. They soon take Sephie's symbol (her <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41551\" href=\"/sigil/4055-41551/\" slug=\"sigil\"> Sigil</a> mixed with Meridian's crest), as their own, and proclaim themselves the Pirates of the Wind.<p>Sephie, Deren, and crew begin boarding and commandeering Cadadorian ship in true pirate style. Many of the Cadadorian soldiers join with Sephie in her fight, and stay on as crew of the newly acquired ships. Sephie's crusade takes her from island to island, meeting with Ministers and asking them to join in her new vision of trade. </p><p>Unbeknownst to Sephie, Ilahn has returned from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43027\" href=\"/elysia/4020-43027/\" slug=\"elysia\"> Elysia</a> with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42961\" href=\"/rhorf/4005-42961/\" slug=\"rhorf\"> Rhorf</a> as his somewhat unwilling servant. A servant who he unleashes on the inhabitants of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43036\" href=\"/torbel/4020-43036/\" slug=\"torbel\"> Torbel</a>.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-42994\" href=\"/jad-takarty/4005-42994/\" slug=\"jad-takarty\"> Jad Takarty</a> is finally reunited with Sephie, and the two childhood friends pick up right where they left off. Crenner sees the relationship between the two, but does not act on his jealousy. Deren Beq, along with Cotson and the others, confront Jad and warn him off from distracting Sephie from her destiny.</p> While the Pirates of the Wind are instituting their blockade, Ilahn and Rho Rhustane hold the embargo on Torbel. Torbel is a huge, and mostly artificial island (the largest on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42973\" href=\"/demetria/4020-42973/\" slug=\"demetria\"> Demetria</a>) which is in need of a constant supply of ore to keep it in the air. Without the much needed ore, Torbel begins to plummet into the ocean below. The Pirates of the Wind show up too late, and are held off by the fiercest Cadadorian forces they have yet faced.<p>After a battle with against the Cadadorians (which they are aided against by Samandahl Rey), and after defeating Rho Rhustane, the Pirates race to Torbel and begin evacuating its inhabitants. Deren works tirelessly to protect Sephie as she strives to keep the massive island afloat. When Torbel falls from the sky, Sephie begins to heal her crew members. When she comes to Deren, Deren tells her to forget about her and move on to the inhabitants of Torbel, many of whom are near death. As <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42994\" href=\"/jad-takarty/4005-42994/\" slug=\"jad-takarty\"> Jad Takarty</a> ironically points out, \"Deren is always right,\" and encourages her to look to the needs of the Torbelites.<br/></p><p>Deren stands by and watches as Sephie later takes on Ilahn in one-on-one combat. Deren trusts that Sephie has learned her lessons well, and is satisfied when it seems that Ilahn is killed at Sephie's hands.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p><b>Sephie's Mission of Unity</b></p><p>Over the next few months, Sephie moves on, first to become Minister of Cadador for a short while, then later on a mission to unify Demetria against further aggression by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42989\" href=\"/reesha-teramu/4005-42989/\" slug=\"reesha-teramu\"> Reesha Teramu</a>. When Sephie takes over Cadador, Deren begins to allow herself to fade into the background, pushing Sephie to assert herself and grow in her confidence.</p> The Pirates of the Wind reach the quiet city of Nescoan in her sunship. This island prides itself on its etiquette and excellence. Nearly the entire city is a place of peace, with even the \"bad\" part of town being far better than most of Demetria's other larger cities. While Sephie meets with the city's Minister, Deren and the crew look for a bit of excitement. Not finding their type of people very easily, they are finally directed to the only bar in town with a somewhat rough reputation. They soon find that even this place is a bit to refined and cultured for their tastes, and quickly fix this by instigating a wonderful bar fight, the best this quiet island had ever seen.       Near the end of the bar fight, Deren is confronted with a ghost of her past, Renni, the boy (now a man) who broke her heart and turned her into the woman she is today. She asserts herself once and for all and reclaims a bit of herself she had set aside in spite so long ago. Deren tells her former love off, and leaves him standing alone in the bar. The next morning, as Sephie and crew are loading onto the airship, Deren runs to an art shop and buys anew what she had destroyed years before. Deren Beq takes it upon herself to become the chronicler of Sephie's story.<p>Deren follows Sephie to their discovery of the lost city of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43056\" href=\"/sheristan/4020-43056/\" slug=\"sheristan\"> Sheristan</a>, and then back to Meridian as they seek to further make enroads against Ilahn. Very soon, Deren must stand back and watch as Sephie is yet again attacked ferociously, this time by a quartet of Sigil-bearers from different worlds, recruited by Ilahn. Sephie successfully defeats the new attackers, and drains Ilahn as well. Ilahn escapes in the hopes of regaining his power.</p><p>The remaining Pirates of the Wind watch as Sephie literally flies off into the sunset, ostensibly to fight in the coming war for the fate of the universe against the forces of the Negation.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><h2>Note on CrossGen Comics</h2><p>Meridian was one of the few CrossGen comics titles to come fully to a close before the company went bankrupt and ceased publishing. It is believed that Sephie would have played a major role in the Negation War title if the company had survived. The fate of Deren Beq and the crew of the Pirates of the Wind remains unknown.</p><br/><p><br/><a href=\"///\"> </a></p>",

    "deck": "Danik is an ascended Atlantean who has gained near omnipotent power. He has split himself into multiple aspects in an effort better ready his universe for an attack by Charon of the Negation universe.",
    "description": "<h2>Citizen of Atlantis</h2> <p>Danik was born in Atlantis on the planet earth over 100,000 years before the current time in the Bright Universe. The Atlanteans evolved to near perfection thousands of years before the beings who would one day become Homo Sapiens even discovered fire.</p> <p>The Atlanteans honed their abilities to a razor fine edge by following the Five Disciplines: Mind, Body, Spirit, Passion and Empathy. Danik was a student of the Spirit discipline, which focused the mental abilities of the individual. Danik's mental prowess was so advanced, he came to be considered the most powerfully mentally disciplined Atlantean who ever lived. So powerful was he, that he was able to free his mentor Amatus from a mental virus, and then subsequently destroy that same malady. </p>Diennara and Chaund, one of the premier Atlanteans couples, developed the philosophy of *Transition,* a culmination of the Five Disciplines which would allow the Atlanteans to break free of their physical evolution and become godlike beings.Danik was the leading figure in the years to come for the majority faction of Atlanteans who wised to undergo *Transition.* Solusandra, one of the younger and more headstrong Atlanteans was determined to undergo the change, but she was dissuaded by Danik and many others because she was unwilling to cast away all emotion during the transition process. She could not be kept from it, however, and accompanied the majority.  <p>Capricia, Danik's best friend and potential love interest, was the leader of the faction who believed Transition should be postponed. Capricia and the others like her believed that the role of the Atlanteans on earth was to protect and guide humanity on its climb up the evolutionary ladder. Because of this belief, those electing to stay behind would lock themselves inside stasis tubes deep inside Atlantis in order to better survive the powerful backwash of energy unleashed during Transition.<br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h2>Transition</h2> <p>Danik, Diennara, Chaund, Solusandra and the majority faction of Atlanteans flew into the air on the appointed day, and those staying behind entered their stasis tubes. Though concerned with Solusandra's refusal to discard all emotion, she was eventually proved correct. Solusandra soon becomes the most powerful among those who transitioned, and was now feared and despised by all her peers but for Danik.</p> <p>Combining their powers, the other ascended Atlanteans attacked Solusandra and wiped her mind, leaving Danik—who was sympathetic to her—to watch over her. Danik slowly came to the realization that Solusandra was correct in her belief to keep hold of her emotions, and saw that she was the only Atlantean to have transitioned correctly.</p> <p>Solusandra created a great many worlds throughout the Bright Universe. Now with her mind wiped, Danik proposed a \"game\" to her. She was to give her Sigil to one (sometimes two) inhabitants of each planet, thereby advancing them up to the top of the evolutionary ladder and imbuing them with great powers. Danik hoped to use these new and powerful people as an army against his fellow Atlanteans. This proves to be unnecessary, as Solusandra eventually regains her mind and is attacked by the other Atlanteans. When Solunandra breaks through to the Negation (Dark) universe during their battle, she tries to draw energy from the Negation itself. Charon, god of the Negation, tries to join with Solusandra, but the opposing powers are not compatible, and cause a forceful explosion that kills all other Atlanteans apart from Danik and herself. Solusandra survives by \"breaking apart,\" sending parts of her memory and self-awareness into the many Sigils she had placed throughout the Bright Universe. </p> <p>Danik also traveled to his original home of Atlantis and awoke his former best friend, Capricia. The Atlantean stasis tubes malfunctioned, and did not awaken those who stayed behind. Now they are wrenched back into the present over 100,000 years too late. He tells her to choose five more Atlanteans to awaken, and he then marks them all with his own Sigil, granting them refinements and increases to their own inborn powers. These newly awakened Atlanteans are immediately attacked by Negation monsters, the threat for which Danik now trained the universe's Sigil bearers to oppose.</p> <p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h2>Avatars of Danik</h2> <p>In order to better keep watch and mentor the Sigil-bearers spread across the universe, Danik splits himself into numerous splinter aspects. Each of these aspects, while being completely a part of Danik, are each also unique individuals. While Danik is a cold and unemotional being, many of his aspects show deep emotion. The real connection between the aspects is unknown, but they do not seem to share a group mind but rather must join together to share their accumulated knowledge.</p> <p>Each of the individual avatars watches over one of the Sigil-bearers created by Solusandra, along with the six Atlanteans he brought back to awareness.</p> <h2>Known Aspects</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/103169-163340-danik.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-103169\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2175\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/103169-163340-danik.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-103169\"><img alt=\"Danik\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1494/103169-163340-danik.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/103169-163340-danik.jpg 400w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1494/103169-163340-danik.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Danik</figcaption></figure><strong>Danik</strong> appears as himself in this aspect to interact with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13224\" href=\"/capricia/4005-13224/\" slug=\"capricia\">Capricia</a> and the other Atlanteans on planet Earth.

They fight the troops for a little while and made a quick escape when the chance presented itself. They flew to a forest where they are forced to travel by foot due to Dragons roaming the area. They decide to rest near a waterfall, however they are quickly ambushed by a Dragon. Grace tries to fend it off while the others run; they would be saved by a four-legged Dragon. Four-legged Dragons are much more intelligent than the Two-Legged Dragons. The Two-Legged Dragons only know how to hunt prey. They were all able to escape, however Troy collapses and dies.

Eyron reveals to Grace that it is not a disease that is plaguing the world, the Light had died and is causing all Magic to fade away. He reveals to Grace that their existence does not travel in a straight line, but actually travels in a circle. It is referred to as a Cycle, and as of now it is no longer the age of Magic.</p> <p>Later that day,                                                                                                                                 Seph was finally able to gather enough energy to walk on his own. However, he had lost his wings and had become depressed because of it. Grace tries to help him look on the bright side, but unable to cope with the loss of his wings, yells back at Grace.

Grace assumed that something bad might happen and rushed to judgment. But when she stepped outside, she realized that                                                                                                                               Lucivia wanted                                                                                                                              Seph to take care of a baby Dragon that had just lost her mother. He explains to Grace that this will help ease his pain as he tries to raise the Dragon.                                                                                                                             Lucivia continues talking to Grace and explains that the end of Magic does not mean death. Some will die, but there will be those who can endure the loss of Magic until the cycle completes a full circle, bringing back Magic to the world. Meanwhile, with                                                                                                                            Rainier’s plan working smoothly, the Kingdom of Arcadia had no defense.

Vinn released those that were held captive due to the disease and begged them to help defend the Kingdom. They agree but are easily out-matched by                                                                                                                         Rainier and his men. However, Grace and company arrived just in time on a Dragon, and the battle begins.</p> <p>Grace engages in battle against                                                                                                                        Rainier. Rainier was able to dodge and block her Magic blasts, then he counters with his own blast and knocks her out of the sky. Rainier reveals that after the age of Magic dies, so will the two Kingdoms, and the rise of                                                                                                                       Rainier’s reign begins. Grace continues her assault on Rainier, however Rainier unveils his other Dragon slave, Mooncrest. Mooncrest is a dragon friend of Grace, but he is under                                                                                                                      Rainier’s control, just like many other Dragons. Grace tries to avoid fighting him but Mooncrest was able to grab her. Grace begged Mooncrest to snap out of                                                                                                                     Rainier’s control, but she was left with no choice. Grace breaks her spear and stabs it in Mooncrest’s eye, allowing Grace to break free. An angered Grace, charges at                                                                                                                    Rainier on his blindside and knocks him off his Dragon. Grace takes Rainier’s staff and smashes it across his face.                                                                                                                   Rainier no longer had control of the Dragons and they flew off with him. With the war over and                                                                                                                  King Minas dead, the Kingdoms joined together and Grace tries to explain to them about the Light dying. Some accepted the words of Grace, and some decided to ignore it. As for Grace, she flies into the night sky, to await her time, the time of Magic, to return. She lands near a lake underneath the moonlight, there her wings begin to disintegrate. The age of Magic has died.</p><p><a href=\"/\"> </a></p><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2><i>The Rise of Magic</i></h2> <p><a href=\"/\"> </a></p><p>Hundreds of thousands of years go by and Grace recovers her wings somewhere between Soulfire: Dying of the Light and Soulfire Beginnings. However, it has yet to be revealed when, where, and how. Man has turned to technology and science for power, while Magic was completely forgotten. The age where Dragons roamed the skies and beings with wings that could use magic had become myths. However, on August 6, 2211 <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\" href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\">                                                                                                                San Francisco</a> was attacked by a giant Dragon. A couple of military aircrafts attempted to stop the Dragon, but their efforts proved to be futile as the Dragon easily disposed of them. Meanwhile, Grace was watching from afar and realizes that she has little time to lose. Grace knows that                                                                                                                Rainier is starting to move and that she must find a boy named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45873\" href=\"/malikai/4005-45873/\">                                                                                                                                                         Malikai</a> before                                                                                                                                                          Rainier does.

Malikai crashes down into an alley where he becomes blinded by a light. His eyes finally focus and he sees Grace on a motorcycle. Grace quickly explains to him that he needs to come with her or die.                                                                                                         Malikai was scared and confused so he decided to run. However, Grace would not allow him to die and decided to just drag him with her.

Onyx tries to slash Grace with her blades, but Grace was able to avoid them. Grace then counters                                                                                                   Onyx by using her wings to bat her away.                                                                                                  Onyx then remembers who Grace actually is, and begins to explain that her mission was not to fight a Goddess. Grace shoots a Magic burst at                                                                                                 Onyx but it was too late, she was already gone. However, Grace was able to confirm that                                                                                                Rainier was truly behind this, and that he knew about the boy already. Meanwhile,                                                                                              Malikai crash lands Grace’s vehicle, the glider, and was able to regroup with his friends. Grace arrives shortly after her battle with                                                                                             Onyx.                                                                                            P.J. threatens Grace and tells her to stay away from                                                                                           Malikai, but her patience had begun to grow short. She tells them that there are very powerful people looking for                                                                                          Malikai, and that they will eventually find him. She tells him that many people will die once                                                                                         Malikai is dead himself. However, the three of them could only laugh at Grace’s claims. It angered her that they were laughing and so she unfolds her wings to prove that she is not joking. She tells them that she has to take                                                                                        Malikai to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56180\" href=\"/hawaii/4020-56180/\">                                                                                      Hawaii</a>. There, he will meet the first of the Masters that will teach him to harness his powers.                                                                                      Malikai decides to talk it over with his friends and Grace allows it. They decide that since it is                                                                                     Hawaii, they might as well go. They agree with Grace as long as                                                                                    P.J. and                                                                                   Sonia are allowed to go.

Grace and the other three were finally able to leave the city and arrived at the Battle Pit. It is an arena where people compete against each other with highly advanced technology. Grace explains about the Dragon situation and that they need another way to get to                                                                               Hawaii, and that a man inside the Battle Pit will know what to do.

However, he reveals that he knew she was trying to trick him. He knows that Grace already knew that Jenkins is dead and how he would react when she mentioned                                                          Rainier.                                                         Benoist’s crew seemed to be wary when they were around Grace. Their conversation begins to grow deeper as Grace asks                                                        Benoist if a woman with wings was in his heart. He asks her if she knew Lyra, Grace tells him that she was lucky enough to know Lyra and that she was a wonderful woman.                                                       Malikai spent most of the day out on the balcony of the boat. Later that evening, Grace sees                                                      Malikai on the balcony and decides to go talk to him. She begins to explain to him about Magic and how it had completely disappeared from the world. She tells him that Magic will rise again in the next age. However,                                                     Malikai is still having a hard time absorbing all the new knowledge about Magic. She goes more in dept about the first of the five Masters that they are to meet. Their conversation was interrupted by a horde of Recon Drones that were sent by                                                    Mr. Abel. Grace flies upwards attempting to protect                                                   Malikai and the ship, however                                                  Malikai was knocked off the boat. Luckily                                                 Benoist was there, he tied a rope onto his armor and jumps in to grab                                                Malikai out of the water. He was successful, and decided to reprogram one of the droids to report back with knowledge that                                               Malikai is “dead.” Everyone on the boat was unharmed, and they eventually arrive in Hawaii.

She is the daughter of the first Master named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45863\" href=\"/kamea/4005-45863/\">                                             Kamea</a>.                                             Pili escorted them into the village and informs Grace that they are aware of the situation. They arrive in front of a giant bonfire and another flight of stairs. However,                                            Pili explains that only                                           Malikai is allowed to ascend upwards to meet the first Master,                                                                                                                                                          Kamea.</p> <p>                                        Malikai was given a large robe to wear and continues towards                                        Kamea. Kamea talks to                                       Malikai through his mind, as he believes that words can lose meaning and thoughts stay pure.                                      Malikai learns that he was chosen long before his birth, and that Samusara, the Bringer of Light, chose him and many others before to try and bring back the age of Magic. Meanwhile, everyone else was enjoying a big feast. After                                     Malikai was done, he decided he wanted to be alone. The next day,                                    P.J.,                                   Sonia, and                                  Pili were hanging out on the beach while Grace bathed alone at a waterfall. She believes that                                 Malikai will be different from the others, and that he will bring back the age of Magic.                                Malikai finally confronts his friends and tells him that he will go with Grace. However, his friends insist that they go with him. Later that evening, just before they were to depart for <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55973\" href=\"/tokyo/4020-55973/\">                              Tokyo</a> to meet the next Master,                              Pili tells                             P.J. that she had a vision that one of them will die on this journey. After they leave,                            Pili talks to her father and tells him that she saw his death too. However,                           Kamea was ready to accept it. Shortly after                          Pili ran back to the village in tears,                         Kamea was assassinated by                        Onyx. </p> <p><a href=\"/\"> </a></p><p>The group arrives in                      Tokyo and as they went to meet the next Master, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45844\" href=\"/ren-watastu/4005-45844/\">                                                                                                                                                         Ren Watastu</a>’s place, they were attacked by a large amount of women. Grace knocks one of them down and demands she deliver the message that she has arrived.                     Ren finally reveals himself and he tells them that he will not help the boy, because just like all the previous ones,                    Malikai will also fail. Grace demanded that                   Ren help him, otherwise he’d be betraying his own bloodline. They also learn that                  Kamea was recently killed, then                 Malikai suddently shoots fire from his hands.                Ren offers               Malikai one day to prove his worth to              Ren.             Malikai would eventually succeed in proving his worthiness to            Ren, and they begin his training. Grace becomes a little worried about           Malikai. He is absorbing so much knowledge, but she fears for his lack of wisdom. Grace later talks to          Malikai, to which he begins to blame his new responsibilities for causing the rift between him and his friends. However, Grace reassures him that it is all his doing. They are then attacked by a giant Dragon that bursts through the window.</p> <p>The Dragon snatches         Malikai inside his mouth. They realize that the Dragon is only a machine, and that this attack is most likely        Rainier’s doing. Grace flies after the Dragon in hopes of freeing       Malikai. However, the Japanese Military engages the Dragon. Grace tries to warn them to leave, but they ignore her. They fire at the Dragon which forces Grace to protect the Dragon, since      Malikai was still inside its mouth. However, the military was able to clip its wings and the dragon falls downwards.     Malikai was able to get free by blowing up from inside the Dragon’s mouth. The Dragon retaliates and shoots fire at    Malikai, however he would still be alive when his friends arrive. They depart for their next destination, the Everlands in Machu Piccu. Grace explains that this is the only area where the Light of Magic still glows, however it is like a dim light in darkness. She opens a passageway and the group goes down. There, they are confronted by a beast and   Malikai decides to handle it himself.</p><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2><b>Powers</b></h2><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2><i>Magic</i></h2><p>Grace is of winged beings that have the ability to use Magic. Magic is a force drawn from the Light. However, when the light died, Magic faded away. All those that were able to use Magic died or lost their ability to use Magic and their wings then disintegrated. Grace, though she lost her wings, was able to live on. Now in the year 2211, technology has become the main source of power. However, Grace has returned and her wings are back. She can also use her Magic again, but her Magic power has currently shown no limitation. She mainly uses Magic blasts for offensive attacks.</p><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2><i>Flight</i></h2><p>Grace has the ability to fly, being from a winged race. Their wings are similar to various types of insects. She can conceal her wings by folding them up and wearing a cloak. The wings are also a part of Magic, and so when the Light died and Magic faded away, everyone's wings disintegrated.</p>",

    "deck": "Solusandra is an ascended Atlantean, and creator of many of the planets of the Sigilverse also known as the Bright Universe. She is soley responsible for the creation of the First and of the Sigil-Bearers.",
    "description": "<br/> <h2>Overview</h2><br/>  Solusandra is perhaps the single most important character in the Crossgen universe as she single handedly created <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42952\" href=\"/the-first/4060-42952/\" slug=\"the-first\">the First</a> and gave the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41551\" href=\"/sigil/4055-41551/\" slug=\"sigil\">Sigils</a> to the main characters of Crossgen Comics. Initially Solusandra was an Atlantean on Earth thousands of years ago. As Atlanteans grow up, they are expected to pick one of the five disciplines to practice; Mind, Body, Spirit, Passion, and Empathy. An Atlantean's job and power was decided by which discipline they picked. Solusandra was considered a selfish Atlantean by her instructor <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13224\" href=\"/capricia/4005-13224/\" slug=\"capricia\">Capricia</a>, as she did not want to choose, and would rather have practiced all of the disciplines. Eventually the Atlanteans discovered a way to ascend into God-hood, however the process would remove all of their emotions.  <br/> <br/>  Solusandra initially refused to participate, as she did not like this aspect of the ascension and chose to stay on Earth with the group of Atlanteans who would usher in a new age for humans. However because she was in love with the Atlantean known as Chaund, Solusandra changed her mind, and decided to join the ascension with him. She was warned by a fellow Atlantean named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42966\" href=\"/danik/4005-42966/\" slug=\"danik\">Danik</a> against this because her hatred for the process of ascension could ruin it for all of the other Atlanteans participating. However, this was not the case, as the ascension did go as planned, making the Atlanteans into gods without emotion.  <br/> <br/><p>    However, this did not seem to be the case for Solusandra who kept her emotions, and fought the other ascended Atlanteans. She lost and was banished into a corner of the universe by her fellow Atlanteans, who removed some of her power, memories and also assigned Danik to keep a close watch over her, making sure she would never return. Solusandra eventually found a way to regain her power and confronted her fellow Atlanteans only to have a battle break out. This out-pouring of energy broke through a dimensional barrier, revealing an alternative universe known as the Negation. Solusandra and the other Atlanteans were soon attacked by the Negation's God-Emporer known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13218\" href=\"/charon/4005-13218/\" slug=\"charon\">Charon</a>. The battle resulted in the death of all of the remaining Atlanteans with the exception of Solusandra, who had disperesed herself through out the universe. </p> <p>  Solusandra landed on barren rock which her powers turn a certain part into a paradise. When she awoken she knew nothing about her until she touched a floating Sigil and remembered her name and was transported to Helios, a planet where everyone is trapped in a virtual reality game. Lindy's guardian which is a avatar of Danik attacked Solusandra who was considered an anomaly. Solusandra destroyed it which made all Danik's avatars feel her. <br/>   </p><p>    She teleported back to Solus with Lindy, there Solusandra tells her the energy the worlds have is fading and the Sigilbearers create energy through their battles. Solusandra touches another floating Sigil and is transported to a world but before she can go there she is grabbed by Altwaal, who gives her a circlet which is one of 7 weapons Solusandra gave him. She only notices him to be not a Sigilbearer and someone she was proud of.  </p> <br/> <br/> <b><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/17099/1087189-solus_02_p13_super.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/17099/1087189-solus_02_p13_thumb.jpg\"/></a></b> She returns to Solus to find a huge creature looking for her, Solusandra attacks it and plays with it. She goes into the green part of the planet and learns the creature can't come into it, unbeknown to Solusandra or Lindy the creature was created by Danik to find out what the anomaly is and destroy it.  <br/> <br/> <b><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1494/103498-184024-solusandra_super.JPG\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1494/103498-184024-solusandra_thumb.JPG\"/></a></b> Solusandra teleports to Ureland, where she is to find Brath another Sigilbearer and get his Sigil. Brath does not fight and let Solusandra take his Sigil.  She gets her memory of her talking to Caprica in Atlantis, Caprica is telling Solusandra she cannot learn all the ways, that she need to pick one, but Solusandra doesn't want to, and calls herself the One Alone.  <br/> <br/><p>Solusandra teleports back to Lindy, who asks to go with Solusandra wherever she is going, Solusandra agrees and touches another floating Sigil. They teleport to a planet called Abyelos, where unbeknown to Lindy and Solusandra the statues there are people. A jetpack appears on Solusandra's back, where she takes flight and finds out that these are people not statues and their still living. Lindy starts to transform into a statue and Solusandra heals her. They hear the Sigilbearer and goes to him as he is crying to his statue father asking for forgiveness. The Sigilbearer Mikos tells his story of when he figured out his power he did many things but the people of the planet wanted more. He then tried to make them stop but turned them all into crystalline statues. Solusandra gets angry with Mikos when he says he was chosen wrongly. She tells Miko she will not turn him back and he has to do it himself or she will not help, take the Sigil and let him succumb to the others statue problem. She blasts away Mikos mentor who Solusandra says seems familiar. Mikos figure it out and cures everyone as the big dog creature attacks Solusandra. Solusandra comes and takes the Sigil from Mikos but is shown by a big cosmic face that tells Solusandra that she did not create it. </p> <p>             Solusandra and Lindy are back on Solus, when Lindy puts on the Circlet one of Altwaal’s weapons. Solusandra shoots a blast at Lindy to show the Circlet protects. Lindy suggests finding the other weapons and Solusandra agrees taking them to Elysia home of The First. Solusandra and Lindy arrives right after Gannish tells The First that there were others before them. Solusandra comes and gets the Gauntlet from the willing Pyrem since he understands what she is. Ingra attacks her and Solusandra chokes her until the other First attacks Solusandra. She screams out don’t make her break her toys which had other First mystified and angry. </p> <p>             Solusandra goes to a great monument for Altwaal, where the one of Altwaal’s weapons lie. Altwaal tells her not to grab it and she gets mad until she realizes he want it for the First and this monument builds up their spirit for the upcoming war. She leaves to find Lindy who is stories tall, and absorbed to much energy, Solusandra mentions the change the Sigil did was genetic and her power would of come back without the Sigil. Lindy is attacked by The First and is being boasted on by Solusandra. Solusandra speaks to herself saying this is The First final test. When she gets hit by Lindy she takes away her power after the big dog creature appears again and Lindy fights it, they then depart back to Solus.</p> <p>             Solusandra and Lindy appear next to a mind reading and precognitive Sigilbearer who fights back after Solusandra tried to take the Sigil. Solusandra sees herself back on Atlantis hearing a speech about transition. Danik talks to her about not doing it because she still shows emotions, and doesn’t know why now she wants to do it. She tells him she want to see it blow up in his face when it doesn’t work. Solusandra tells Danik they wouldn’t be anything without emotions and all he wants to do is control her and that will never happen. </p>   She teleports back to Solus with her mind messed up, and then teleports to Ciress, where Lindy says has almost as much power as Elysia. Solusandra awaken from her mental problem. Solusandra goes into the Nouveu guild and asks Giselle’s sister where the Sigilbearer is. Genieve calls the guards who Solusandra turns into babies and flies off. Solusandra battles Giselle who gives her a good fight but looses in the end. Solusandra and Lindy travel’s back to Solus and Solusandra defeats the hound. After she defeats it Danik appears and tells Solusandra that she was the one who knew the ascended Atlanteans weren’t as perfect as the hoped to be. The other ascended Atlanteans attacked Solusandra and placed her into her own part of the universe in a childlike mind without memories where she created creatures and planets watched by Danik the only one who wouldn’t succumb to her manipulations. Danik knew something was coming and the only thing to protect the universe was the Sigilbearers, he used Solusandra help to create them, but the other Atlanteans felt what was happening and was coming to attack them again. Danik made her remember. When the Atlanteans attacked they absorbed her powers but in retaliation she absorbed what they stole plus more and ripped a rift in the universe leading to the Negation, something in the Negation stole it back and the only way to save herself was to split apart. Danik leaves telling her she must regain her memories since they are the last of their kind.      <br/><br/><p>   </p><p> </p> <h2>Power</h2>Solusandra is extremely powerful and as an Ascended Atlantean, is privileged to a wide range of power   which includes, but is not limited to; super strength, speed, self propelled flight, single or mass teleportation across the universe, extra sensory perception, object and sentient life creation, magic, the ability to control a number of energy types in a variety of ways, regeneration, telepathy, empathy, and the ability to survive in the vacuum of space without the need for food, water, or oxygen. She is extremely powerful and is able to single handedly defeat even the most powerful Firsts such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13246\" href=\"/ingra/4005-13246/\" slug=\"ingra\">Ingra</a> with a wave of her hand. She has also held off many ascended Atlanteans who had godlike power.",

    "deck": "A new, high-tech Spirit of Vengeance stalks the streets of Transverse City and struggles against the evil corporate entity D/Monix.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kenshiro \"Zero\" Cochran was a hacker in Transverse City who made the mistake of stealing information form a corporation called <a href=\"/dmonix/4060-57977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57977\">D/Monix</a> -- a mistake he paid for with his life when D/Monix had him hunted down and shot with a poisoned flechette. Knowing he had no hope of survival, Zero uploaded his consciousness into cyberspace in order to keep his assassins from recovering their data.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Though his body was dead, Zero's mind survived, stored digitally by a group of artificial intelligences which dwelt in a hidden sector of cyberspace known as the Ghostworks. The Ghostworks offered Zero a second chance of sorts, asking him to become their \"avatar\" in the real world due to his rebellious attitude and complete disregard for authority. Zero accepted.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">His mind and personality were downloaded into a Cybertek 101 robotic body, which he used to avenge his own death and fight the evil schemes of the D/Monix corporation, calling himself \" <a href=\"/ghost-rider/4005-4268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4268\">Ghost Rider</a>\" based on the similarities between his new body and abilities to those of the anti-hero from the previous century. Although the personality of this new \"Ghost Rider\" was essentially Zero Cochran, the Ghostworks still maintained a measure of control over his mind, even going so far as to prevent him from thinking of certain actions which might lead to his becoming more independent than they wanted him to be.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Ghost Rider 2099 was created by Len Kaminski, Chris Bachalo and Mark Buckingham and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ghost-rider-2099-1-burning-chrome/4000-107928/\">Ghost Rider 2099 issue 1</a> (1994).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Ghost Rider of 2099</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2094144-sp.png\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2094144-sp.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2094144-sp.png\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kenshiro \"Zero\" Cochrane was a hacker who ran with the <a title=\"Hotwire Martyrs (Earth-928)\" href=\"/hotwire-martyrs/4060-58778/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58778\">Hotwire Martyrs</a>, a street gang based out of the <a title=\"Transverse City (Earth-928)\" href=\"/transverse-city/4020-57665/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57665\">Transverse City</a> sprawl. In mid 2099, the Martyrs hacked into a fiberoptic trunkline and snagged a heavily-encrypted data archive of unknown origin. While they were attempting to decrypt the file, the Martyrs were attacked by a gang known as the <a title=\"Artificial Kidz (Earth-928)\" href=\"/artificial-kidz/4060-58777/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58777\">Artificial Kidz</a>, who proceeded to murder most of the Martyrs and set off in pursuit of Zero and the archive. With the poison from the fletchette round he took while fleeing the Kidz rapidly eating away at his nervous system, Zero makes a last-ditch effort to screw them over by transferring the encrypted file to his girlfriend and then jacking directly into cyberspace in an attempt to burn out his headware implants.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shortly after his white-hot fade into oblivion, Zero awakes to find himself in a surrealistic <a href=\"/cyberspace/4020-57647/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57647\">cyberspace</a> populated by a group of rogue machine intelligences who call their realm The Ghostworks. These AIs believe that the current human society (your typical \"Corporations Own Everything\" cyberpunk dystopia) is heading for a total collapse. And, being completely dependent on the world's technological infrastructure for survival, they wish to send Zero back to the real world to serve as their agent of change. Appealing to his anarchist sensibilities, the Ghostworks couch the whole deal as a chance for him to get back at The System and all those authority figures who seem bound and determined to make life miserable for \"the little guy\" Zero, of course, accepts - though whether this was really of his own free will or due to subtle modifications the AIs made to his personality construct is debatable.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The machines hijack an automated factory and construct a heavily modified variant of a Cybertek 101 warbot, laden with advanced nanotech weaponry, self-repair, and camouflage capabilities, and download their copy of Zero's personality into its neuro-net. Before hitting the streets, Zero uses the robot's holographic capabilities to wreath his skull-like head in artificial flame - an homage to his fallen comrades that also serves to make him look very similar to the Ghost Rider of the previous century. Appropriately enough, his first course of action is to seek vengeance against those responsible for their deaths. His quest eventually leads back to the D/Monix corporation (the legal owners of the archive) and his father, Harrison Cochrane.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the course of his investigation into the missing file, Harrison realized that, as the hackers had used his own access codes to intercept the data transmission, the only suspect could be his son, Kenshiro. Feeling more loyalty to the corporation than to his gutter-trash son, it was a simple matter for Harrison to hire the Artificial Kidz to wipe out the Hotwire Martyrs and retrieve the archive. Upon beating this information out of his father, Ghost Rider prepares to kill the old man, but is distracted when he learns that D/Monix is currently torturing his former girlfriend, <a title=\"Kylie Gagarin (Earth-928)\" href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Kylie_Gagarin_(Earth-928)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kylie Gagarin</a>, in an attempt to find out where she stashed the copy of the archive he'd sent her before his \"death.\"</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While hunting down the component chemicals for the drug he needs to save Kylie's life, Ghost Rider heads to an <a title=\"Alchemax (Earth-928)\" href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Alchemax_(Earth-928)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alchemax</a> facility in <a title=\"New York City\" href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/New_York_City\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York City</a> - where he runs afoul of current incarnation of<a title=\"Miguel O'Hara (Earth-928)\" href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Miguel_O%27Hara_(Earth-928)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a>. They battle, but GR makes it away with the chemical in time. With the drug synthesized, he volunteers to go into Kylie's head to bring her out of her coma, which begins a phantasmagorical journey into her psyche that gives insight into both Kylie's past and provides a few glimpses into what Zero was like when he was alive. Of course, he doesn't much care for the version of himself that he sees and, after Kylie wakes up, Ghost Rider tries to convince her that Zero is dead and that she's better off without him. Of course, the way he says it leads her to realize that GR is Zero and, thus, has the exact opposite effect of making her more curious about him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After discovering that his personality construct has been modified to prevent him from mentioning certain topics of discussion (namely the Ghostworks and things related to them), Ghost Rider dives into cyberspace in an attempt to track the Works down and hammer out some answers. The AIs hide from him and some discuss the possibility that they may have made a mistake when they chose Zero as their agent. Others suggest they wait it out - citing that the Ghost Rider will soon be much too busy to bother them. The prophecy comes true, of course, as he's launched into a series of battles pitting him against a heavily-cybered <a title=\"Jeter (Earth-928)\" href=\"/jeter-warlord/4005-69067/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69067\">Jeter</a> (the man who killed him), a thrill-kill club that's been using monsterous-looking constructs to hunt down former special-forces types for sport, and a highly-skilled cybernetic assassin named <a title=\"Coda (Earth-928)\" href=\"/coda/4005-7292/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7292\">Coda</a> - who actually manages to blast GR into his constituent components.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2094126-sp.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2094126-sp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2094126-sp.jpg\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A short time later, Ghost Rider revives to discover that the <a title=\"Victor von Doom (Earth-928)\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doom</a> of 2099 has managed to take control of the United States. Having earlier made a deal with the Ghostworks for access to their agent (in exchange for leaving them be), Doom sends his <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> agents out into the city to track the rogue android down. GR is hauled before the President and presented with an offer to become the Federal Marshal for the Transverse City region. Though he initially refuses (not wanting to become part of the System he so despises), Doom triggers a series of override commands and forces Zero to accept the position.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Flush with his new found power, Ghost Rider proceeds to ride roughshod over a number of petty criminals and gangs, as well as the drug lord who'd helped him locate the chemicals he'd needed to save Kylie earlier. This betrayal begins a downward slide where all of Zero's former friends and associates begin to turn on him - seeing only another Oppressor rather than the Hero of the Common Man Ghost Rider thought himself to be. At the same time, he finds himself despised by the \"real\" securi-cops, who see him as a loose cannon giving them a bad name (and, likely, suffer some jealousy for the wide operational latitude he's been given).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Powers and Abbilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Zero's robotic body grants him superhuman strength and durability, as well as freeing him of the need to eat, drink, breathe or sleep, though he would have to re-charge from time to time (this became less of a problem later on after the acquired a portable power generator). His robot body was able to self-repair.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Both of the Cybertek 101's hands could be transformed; the left formed razor-sharp claws, while the right became a high-tech chainsaw. In addition, it was capable of firing optic lasers.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It came equipped with a stealth system capable of rendering it invisible to both electronic detection and the naked eye, as well as a \"solidgram\" camouflage system which allowed Zero to disguise himself as anyone. The \"solidgram\" was also used to create the illusion of the robot's head being on fire, further mimicking the original Ghost Rider.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Zero's previous experience as a hacker allowed him to access secure computer systems with little difficulty, as well as to project his psyche into cyberspace to obtain information directly.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ghost Rider's motorcycle was a modified version of the one Zero had used before his death, a Ford Velociraptor 900. Like many vehicles of the time period, it had no wheels, instead having the capability to hover or fly.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He also use a .50 calibre semi-automatic handgun and several grenades (standard SHIELD operative equipment).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Ghost rider movie game.</strong></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ghost Rider 2099 appeared in the video game adaption of the movie <a href=\"/ghost-rider/4025-18/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-18\">Ghost Rider</a> as an alternate character after beating the game.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom</strong> 3</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104374/2104779-ghostrider_dlc_64836_640screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2104779\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104374/2104779-ghostrider_dlc_64836_640screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2104779\"><img alt=\"Ghost Rider 2099 in Ultimate Marvel Vs.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><br/>The Great One is a cosmic being that looks like a brain being propelled by a starship. He is vastly enormous. He travels the universe and finds worlds worthy of his collection. They are then placed under his protection. He gives planets the choice and they are able to decine. He is a very peaceful and loving creature and claims that this is his nature.<br/><br/>Once under his protection, all matter is transformed into brain waves and thought patterns and become part of him. This causes the sense of time to stop and all things remain as they are forever. <br/><br/><h2>Zenn-La</h2><br/>The Great One found <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41038\" href=\"/zenn-la/4020-41038/\" slug=\"zenn-la\">Zenn-La</a> worthy of his protection. Zenn-La was caught in the middle of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\" href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" slug=\"kree\">Kree</a>-<a data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\" href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" slug=\"skrulls\">Skrull </a>War and was under constant need of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\" href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" slug=\"silver-surfer\">Silver Surfer's</a> protection. The population voted to be placed under his protection. The Surfer managed to enter the Great One's mind with the help of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\" href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" slug=\"moondragon\">Moondragon </a>and lived peacefully for weeks and planned to remain there forever.<br/><br/>But the Surfer's prescence brought out much anger in the Great One, who instantly attacked the outsider. The Surfer dealt him a fatal blow and only then did the Great One reveal that it was fear that drove him, because only an outsider could harm him and those in his mind. With Moondragon's help, he saved Zenn-La from the Great One's fate, but lost his love Shalla Bal forever.<br/><br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><br/>The Great One drifts through space in a dream state. He is protected by a nearly impenetrable force field. He has been compared to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\">Galactus </a>in power, but his is the power of the mind. He only leaves his own mind to search for more planets worthy of his protection. Attached to him is a ship of some sort that propels him through space. The speed at which he can travel is never stated.<br/><br/>To those who view the Great One in his own mind, he most likely appears as one of their own race. In the case of Zenn-La, he looked as they did. <br/><br/>In his mind he is quite powerful. He is capable of flight and blasts of energy. He cannot be harmed by those who have agreed to be a part of his realm. <br/>",

Steve's plan is to disguise himself as a clown at a local carnival in order to get close enough to throw a pie in Winston's face. As Steve is about to make his move, Winston and his girlfriend are kidnapped by a trio of sinister clowns and dragged into the Hall of Mirrors. Steve follows them, deciding that saving his friends is more important than revenge on Winston. He finds out that these clowns are extradimensional beings planning a full-scale invasion on Earth. The clowns open up a portal to <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dimension-ecch/4020-62845/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-62845\">Dimension Ecch</a> and drag Winston and his girlfriend through. Steve follows after them, awaiting an uncertain future.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Slapstick was created by Len Kaminski and James Fry III and first appeared in his own mini-series, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/slapstick-1-the-totally-awesome-origin-of-slapstic/4000-36407/\">Slapstick issue 1 </a>from 1992.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Becoming Slapstick</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/116671-181677-slapstick.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/116671-181677-slapstick.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/116671-181677-slapstick.jpg\"></a></figure><p>Traveling through the portal affects Steve's molecular structure, making him rubbery and blob-like. He lands in a cell occupied by the former Scientist Supreme of Dimension Ecch. The scientist, who was imprisoned for opposing the invasion plan, explains that when Steve went through the portal, \"rather than having [his] atoms scattered throughout the universe, [he] was molecularly dis-discombobulated. This transformed him into a new form of matter-- a type of living unstable molecules called electroplasm, which is totally indestructible.\"</p><p>The scientist gives Steve two gloves outfitted with \"molecular stabilitroids\" that will enable him to control the cohesion of his body's molecules. The gloves also enable Steve to carry weapons in hyperspace. He can make the hidden weapons appear at will, as if he simply plucked them out of thin air. The Scientist Supreme then goes on to encourage Steve to use his new abilities to stop the evil ruler of Dimension Ecch. After doing so, Steve rescues the kidnapped humans and returns them to Earth. His best friend Mike Peterson, one of the kidnapees, recognizes Steve even in his newly-altered state. Once Steve tells Mike everything that happened, Mike informs Steve that he has \"Just had an origin\" and suggests Steve come up with a new name under which he can fight crime. After rejecting several suggestions (including \"The Joker\" and \"The Jester\"), Steve finally names himself Slapstick.</p><h3>New Warriors and The Initiative</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/191713-122870-slapstick.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/191713-122870-slapstick.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/191713-122870-slapstick.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/191713-122870-slapstick.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After several solo adventures, Slapstick joins the <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\"> New Warriors</a>. He was, however, not with the team when they accidentally blew up Stamford, Connecticut. After <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"> Civil War</a>, he was one of the <a href=\"/the-initiative/4060-42781/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42781\"> Initiative</a> recruits (along with <a href=\"/cloud-9/4005-42783/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42783\"> Cloud 9</a>, <a href=\"/komodo/4005-42782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42782\"> Komodo</a>, <a href=\"/mvp/4005-42787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42787\"> MVP</a>, <a href=\"/ultragirl/4005-40827/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40827\"> Ultragirl</a>, <a href=\"/trauma/4005-42788/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42788\"> Trauma</a>, <a href=\"/thor-girl/4005-12335/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12335\"> Thor Girl</a>, <a href=\"/debrii/4005-40520/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40520\"> Debrii Fields</a>, <a href=\"/hardball/4005-42784/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42784\"> Hardball</a>, and <a href=\"/rage/4005-2097/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2097\"> Rage</a>). When camp instructor <a href=\"/gauntlet/4005-42785/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42785\"> Gauntlet </a>continued to criticize, insult and mock the New Warriors for their mistake, Slapstick became so angry that he ambushed Gauntlet and beat him nearly to death. After his assault, Slapstick painted \"NW\" (for New Warriors) across Gauntlet's chest in Gauntlet's own blood.</p><p>No one ever discovered Slapstick's crime (because Secretary <a href=\"/henry-gyrich/4005-9711/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9711\"> Henry Gyrich</a> ended the investigation for fear it would uncover some of his shady experiments like the <a href=\"/scarlet-spiders/4060-44648/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44648\"> Scarlet Spiders</a>); however, both <a href=\"/justice/4005-4811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4811\"> Justice</a> and Rage (of the Initiative) nearly got jailed, and Gauntlet (who survived and returned to active duty) blamed his assault on the terrorist <a href=\"/ghost/4005-17638/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17638\"> Ghost</a>, a foe of Iron Man.</p><p>Eventually, Justice became so angry at the Initiative that he formed a New Warriors team, and Slapstick joined. <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\"> Norman Osborn</a> then branded the New Warriors wanted criminals.</p><p>The New Warriors entered <a href=\"/camp-hammond/4020-42789/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42789\"> Camp Hammond</a> to retrieve the body of fallen comrade MVP, but found mad Thor cyborg-clone <a href=\"/ragnarok/4005-47573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47573\"> Ragnarok</a> about to kill <a href=\"/gorilla-girl/4005-54441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54441\"> Gorilla Girl</a>. The Initiative intervened and Slapstick (calling Ragnarok a \"hippie\" who needed to be introduced to \"Whack-a-Mole\") attacked Ragnarok. Ragnarok then easily defeated Slapstick. After the battle, Slapstick and the other New Warriors were successful in their mission to retrieve MVP's body.</p><h3>Fear Itself</h3><p>Commander <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Steve Rogers</a> informed<a href=\"/prodigy/4005-4804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4804\"> Prodigy</a> of the unknown meteors that have fallen from the heavens and of the mass panic that is on the horizon. Rogers asked Prodigy to gather heroes on a volunteer basis to help keep the peace and lead a new Initiative---one where there is no forced conscription or registration. Prodigy agrees to become the leader of the new Initiative and most of the former Initiative members including Slapstick gather in Washington DC.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Slapstick is a classic class clown, always quick with a joke or wisecrack, even if they're sometimes poorly timed or inappropriate. Since humor is his personal coping mechanism, he will often try to lighten the mood, or get a laugh from his teammates. Much of the time though, his teammates find him more annoying than funny.</p><p>Using his cartoon-like body, he is able to easily alter his appearance, often to appear more humorous. It's been noted that he has an anger problem, and the results can be catastrophic if he is pushed too far.</p><p>When Steve first got his powers, he was told he needed to use them to fight crime. Always out for a laugh, Steve replied that he would rather \"play cruel tricks on\" crime instead.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>He has similar characteristics to that of a cartoon character. These include limitless durability, increased speed, stamina, strength, and reflexes. He is able to stretch in a manner similar to <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\"> Mr. Fantastic</a>. In an early solo adventure, Slapstick discovers that stimulating his body's electroplasm with ordinary electricity can increase his strength to near-Hulk-or-Thing-like levels.</p><p>Steve wears two gloves. The left glove enables Steve to go from human-form, to Slapstick form at the press of a bottom. The right glove enables to him to store massive quantities of items in sub-space receptacles dubbed \"Infinite Pockets\". The \"pockets\" give off a pink-red hue when accessed.</p><p>In his \"infinite pockets\", he has random stuffed toys including one of a sponge with a face, <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Spider-Man</a>, a rubber chicken, duck, and frog. He also keeps a variety of weapons in there, including: a wooden mallet, chainsaw, flail, dynamite, a shield and a sword. He also carries several gag items, to facilitate his pulling pranks. These include an arrow-through-the-head hat, a boot on a stick, eye-pop glasses, a seltzer bottle, a party horn, and a whoopie cushion. He also carries a lot of junk, such as a trombone, bowling ball and pins, among other things.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-1298</h3><p>In the Mutant X reality Slapstick is a member of the <a href=\"/lethal-legion/4060-42128/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42128\"> Lethal Legion</a>.</p>",

Many times during their growing years the two brothers found themselves at odds with one another, usually because of Ilahn's desires.</p><p>One such situation was an affair of the heart. Both Ilahn and Turos desired the love and attention of the fair maiden Ideria. Ilahn was spurned, and Ideria married Turos. From that day forward, any semblance of brotherly love Ilahn had for his older sibling was washed away in a torrent of hate and jealousy.</p><p>When their father died, Turos was installed as Minister of Meridian while Ilahn went away and married the daughter of the Minister of Cadador. When both his father-in-law and his wife subsequently died, Ilahn was proclaimed Minister of Cadador. Though Cadador was a much larger and influential island on the planet Demetria, Ilahn would never be satisfied until he had taken Meridian away from his brother.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Minister of Cadador</p><p>=====================</p><p>Each island and village on the planet Demetria contributes to the world trade economy in differing ways. Most provide goods either unavailable to others, or at a such a high level of craftsmanship that their wares are highly sought after above all others. Akasia, a village on the planet's surface, was known for its dye and dyed cloth, which they produced by leeching acidic toxins from th surrounding soil. Meridian was the leading producer of airships. Cadador, however was not a producer of goods as much as a leader in trade and commerce because of their large population.</p><p>Once Minister of Cadador, Ilahn molded the island into a controlling force. He built the island's militia into the largest army and sky navy on the planet, and used it to introduce veiled threats on the other cities of Demetria. In about a decade, Ilahn became the undisputed ruler of worldwide commerce, and few retained the resolve to challenge his authority. In fact, only Meridian stood outside his indirect control, its ship-building community still too vital to the world economy for Ilahn to attempt a direct takeover.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Sigil-bearer</p><p>==============</p><p>Years later, when Turos's daughter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13193\" href=\"/sephie/4005-13193/\" slug=\"sephie\">Sephie</a> was in her mid teenage years, Ilahn came to Meridian for an official state visit. Ostensibly, Ilahn wished to clear the hated and mistrust between the two brothers, and kind-hearted Turos allowed for the opportunity. A trade bargain was struck between the two brothers, and a celebration was thrown in honor of the reconciliation and the new agreement.</p> That night, while sharing drinks on the balcony of Turos's estate, a mystical bird appeared to the two brothers. This creature, an aspect of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42974\" href=\"/solusandra/4005-42974/\" slug=\"solusandra\">Solusandra</a>, granted the two of them Sigils of power. Both men were brought to their knees during the transference, but Ilahn quickly recovered. No so for Turos, because Ilahn had been secretly poisoning his brother, in the hopes of one day soon being able to take over Meridian as Regent and controlling the island through Sephie.       As Turos lay dying, Sephie (who had already lost her mother) rushed to her father's side and cradled him as he drew his last breath. At the instant of his death, the Sigil on her father transferred itself to Sephie, and became a permanent on prominent seal on her forehead. Ilahn, whose Sigil had attached itself to his throat, hurried to conceal his new mark, and thereby not draw attention to himself.<p>Ilahn convinced the city council of Meridian that Turos had been attacked and killed by an assassin, and that they should be on their guard. In sorrow, Sephie and the other Meridianites retired to their beds for the night. Ilahn then hires an assassin to attack his young niece in her bed. Ilahn, who has now already experimented some with his Sigil's power, believes Sephie will survive the ordeal, allowing him to learn of her power. If she does not survive, then the last obstacle in controlling Meridian will be forever gone.</p><p>Later that night, the assassin makes his attempt, but Sephie protects herself unconsciously with the Sigil, and the attacker is slain. Using the attack as an excuse, Ilahn has Turos's mansion set aflame, rousing the city in alarm. Ilahn comes and convinces Sephie and the city council that she is no longer safe on Meridian. As her only living blood relative, he claim the right to be her guardian and takes her with him when he returns to Cadador.</p><p>Ilahn leaves Jon Takarty as interim Minister until such time it is safe for Sephie to return and claim the title. Unknown to all, as Ilahn is leaving Meridian, his navy is approaching and setting up to invade and conquer the island once and for all. Ilahn decides he can better deal with Sephie on his own island.</p><p>The city council, led by Jon Takarty, makes their way under Meridian through a secret network of passages build for just such an occasion. Joined by as many citizens as can get away from the invaders, they board airships hidden in a secret cave in the lower recesses of Meridian and escape into the night, in search of a new home. Ilahn proclaims himself Regent of Meridian, leaving Sephie as Minister in exile.</p> Over the ensuing days, Ilahn demonstrates his power to Sephie, at one point using it to disintegrate her hairbrush as a form of threat. Once he was gone, Sephie used her own powers to reform the hairbrush, showing that her powers were based in healing and repair rather than destruction. Sephie soon flees the ultra-conservative and controlling society, stealing an airship and making her escape. She is quickly discovered by Ilahn's navy and attacked. Thinking her a common thief until too late, Sephie is knocked from her ship and plummets thousands of feet to the planet surface. When Ilahn hears the report, he believes Sephie dead, and so begins to further his plans for the domination of Meridian and then Demetria.<p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Consorting with goddesses and gods</p><p>====================================</p><p>Before Sephie disappears, Ilahn is confronted by the Muse of Giatan, an old seeress who speaks to Ilahn in cryptic riddles. The Muse seems to constantly pit Ilahn against Sephie and set him down the path of world dominance. The few times the Muse appears to Sephie, she seem to take her side as well, so her real design remains unclear for some time.</p> Soon after Sephie's fall, the newcomer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42989\" href=\"/reesha-teramu/4005-42989/\" slug=\"reesha-teramu\">Reesha Teramu</a> presents herself to Ilahn in a venture to become his protégé and eventual consort. Not interested at first, Ilahn eventually sees the benefits of the relationship Reesha is offering, and takes her under his wing. Reesha is just as power hungry as Ilahn, but she lacks the ruthlessness of her new mentor, an attribute which Ilahn begins to hone.<p>Ilahn then learns from the Akasian city council that Sephie is not dead, and that she is in their care. Ilahn travels personally to Akasia to retrieve her, but by the time he arrives Sephie has escaped into the surrounding forest. At first, Maraya, Minister of Akasia tries to hide her escape from Ilahn, and then attempt to hold him prisoner for a ransom from Cadador. In his fury, Ilahn uses his powers to nearly completely destroy the surface village, forcing its citizens to flee and rebuild their community elsewhere.</p> Upon returning to Cadador, Ilahn sets his forces to search for Sephie, then goes about his business of consolidating his hold on Demetria. The Muse reappears and and introduces Ilahn to a new ally, Rho Rhustane. Rhustane is in reality <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42961\" href=\"/rhorf/4005-42961/\" slug=\"rhorf\">Rhorf</a> of the First, and has been assigned by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13246\" href=\"/ingra/4005-13246/\" slug=\"ingra\">Ingra</a> to watch over and learn about the Sigil-bearer. Rhustane offers to initiate talks between Cadador and his own home of Elysia, as well as training in his new powers. In return, Ilahn requests to see the home of Rhustane's people, a proposition Rhustane at first says is not possible, but is soon goaded into by Ilahn.<p>Ilahn and Reesha are whisked to House Sinister in Elysia, and Rhustane reveals himself to be the godlike being known as Rhorf. Upon entering the god's dwelling place, he is immediately met with fear and suspicion because another Sigil-bearer was responsible for the demise of one of their kind, something thought impossible until that day. While visiting a monument to Altwaal, Ilahn is attacked and speared in the back by one of the First. Ilahn's wound was mortal and he should have died, but he learned he could use the force of his will to heal himself. He also immediately discovers that he can siphon the life force of nearby First, and subsequently begins to drain all of those nearby, nearly losing control of the flow of energy. Declaring he will not become a slave of the power, he masters the energy flow and releases the stricken gods.</p><p>Ilahn forces Rhustane to return himself and Reesha to Cadador, and demands the cowed god's allegiance. Rhustane is warned not to betray the Minister, and is reminded that Ilahn will one day return to Elysia and make it his own after he has complete dominance of Demetria. In fear, Rhustane complies and is sent to Meridian to consolidate the Cadadorian control over the island. (Rhorf has also been commanded by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13246\" href=\"/ingra/4005-13246/\" slug=\"ingra\">Ingra</a> to remain close and keep an eye on the powerful Sigil-bearer. Rhustane offers Ilahn a share of his own godly power, but he refuses. Reesha, however, accepts the gift, and is changed by Rhustane into a lighting wielding demi-goddess.</p><p>Leaving Reesha in charge of Cadador, Ilahn begins to journey about the planet, strengthening his hold over trade. He enforces his embargo against the island of Torbel. Torbel is a massive and mostly artificial island that produces pods for the islands of Demetria. These pods are filled with the ore which allows the world's islands to float above the surface. Ilahn has been angered because he believes the Torbelites have broken their trade agreement with Cadador by not offering the latest in ore pod technology.</p> Though Torbel produces the ore pods, they must buy the levitating mineral from the surface mining communities just like every other island in the sky. This precious ore  (if added to the island artificially to allow for more mass to be added to the island) loses it's levitating ability over time, and must be replaced with new, fresh ore. Since Ilahn has placed an embargo on Torbel, they have been unable to purchase new ore for many months, and their island has begun to slowly fall.<p>Torbel, at first unwilling to bow to Ilahn's demands for ore pod technology, now relents and attempts to reconcile with the mad Cadadorian Minister. Ilahn, now drunk with his power and dreams of world dominance, refuses their plea and decides to make an example of the island. He declares *\"Torbel will fall.\"*</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Battle with Sephie</p><p>====================</p> As Torbel begins to fall, Sephie and her Pirates of the Wind arrives attempt to evacuate the island. Sephie, using her Sigil powers strives to repair the island and renew its failing ore, but is unsuccessful. She then tries to keep the island aloft for as long as she can, giving the evacuees more time. Ultimately she is exhausted, and she and the massive island fall from the sky, killing thousands.<p>Sephie is restored by the Muse of Giatan (who appears to her as an energy being), and she begins to heal as many survivors of Torbel as possible. This done, she takes Rho Rhustane's huge cannon-armed ship and proceeds to liberate Meridian from Ilahn's control.</p><p>Ilahn and Reesha follow, and Sephie is finally confronted by her uncle. A great battle ensues, and Ilahn believes he has the upper hand but he is mistaken. In the ruins of her father's house, the two unleash destructive forces against one another. Sephie, who had always before been unwilling to take a life, now realizes that she must defend herself with like force. Though Ilahn has more experience using his powers in an offensive manner, Sephie has been honed and hardened by her months on the run with her pirates.</p> When Ilahn and Sephie touch directly, they begin to share life experiences through a sort of sympathetic telepathy, but Sephie rejects it and forces Ilahn's power back upon itself. To everyone looking on, it appears that Sephie disintegrates her uncle, but in reality he teleports himself away at the last moment, knowing he could not win the battle. For reasons all her own, Sephie does not tell her friends and crew otherwise, leaving them all to believe that she has killed her uncle. Reesha goes into hiding upon the apparent death of Ilahn, and begins to scheme how to regain and keep control of Cadador and enact revenge on Sephie and her Pirates of the Wind.<p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>\"Rebirth\"</p><p>===========</p><p>Reesha infiltrates back into Cadadorian society as Sephie asserts her claim as Minister of Cadador (being Ilahn's only living blood relative). Reesha begins working behind the scenes to take the reins of authority away from the teenager.</p><p>Ilahn, who is not dead, reveals himself to Reesha and makes her privy to his plans. Something has happened to Ilahn during his absence. He has shed decades of age, and his missing eye has been restored. He begins secretly working with Reesha to strengthen his ability to teleport, and under the prodding of the Muse of Giatan learns he can travel anywhere he can picture in his mind's eye. The Muse also teleports Ilahn into the middle of the sky, forcing him to learn to fly like Sephie (though he never gains her level of proficiency).</p> His teleportation skills growing, Ilahn travels the world again to warn the various island's Ministers against recognizing Sephie as a Minister or giving her aide in the future. Returning to Cadador, Ilahn puts his next scheme into mostion. Along with his major-domo, Ilahn forges a will that states he left the Minister-ship of Cadador to his consort Reesha. Ilahn's schemes have now moved beyond dominance of Meridian, to absolute control of Demetria and the worlds beyond. To this end he plans to install Reesha as his puppet minister. At Sephie's installation ceremony, Reesha confronts the council with the fake will, and they proclaim it to be authentic. Reesha Teramu is installed as Minster instead of Sephie.<p>Ilahn continues to work behind the scenes. Now that Cadador is firmly back under his control via Reesha Teramu, he turns his attention to getting his revenge on Sephie. Once he has taken care of her, he intends to fully conquer all of Demetria, then move on to make Elysia his next conquest in order to dominate the remainder of the galaxy. There seems no end to what and who Ilahn is willing to sacrifice in order to destroy Sephie.</p><p>Ilahn begins working on perfecting his budding power of teleportation. Prodded on by the Muse of Giatan, he pushes himself further and further until he is successful in taking himself to other worlds. Accomplishing this, Ilahn approaches other Sigil-bearers and enlists their aide against Sephie (by lying about her true nature).</p><p>Sephie and her Pirates of the Wind reach the quiet city of Nescoan in her sunship. Sephie sheds her usual dress and demeanor to better present herself to the Minister of Nescoan. The island prides itself on its etiquette and excellence. Nearly the entire city is a place of peace, with even the \"bad\" part of town being far better than most of Demetria's other larger cities. Sephie discovers that Ilahn and the Minister of Nescoan have conspired against her. The negotiations nearly deteriorate into violence before Sephie can withdrawn in failure.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <p>Final Confrontation</p><p>=====================</p><p>After Sephie completes a mission to the lost city of Sheristan, Ilahn and his co-opted Sigil-bearers from other worlds track her down and launch a furious attack. Since they have been tricked into believing Sephie is evil, and because they are born warriors on their own worlds, these new enemies attack with great ferocity. Their combined attacks are nearly more than Sephie can take, but she handles herself well by remembering the life of Samandahl Rey. Ilahn also grows angry when they seem to nearly kill her, a pleasure he wanted reserved only for himself.</p><p>Sephie is saved by the very same sympathetic telepathy she had shared with her uncle and Samandahl Rey. When she makes contact with Lord Birrema of Courabo, she learns that she is able to siphon off their sigil power in much the same way Ilahn was able to drain the First. She also learns his ability to make a sword, shield, and armor of light from the connection. In turn, Birrema learns of Sephie's true nature and the lies of Ilahn. He helps Sephie to her feet, and she quickly dispatches the remaining Sigil-bearers, leaving her free to confront Ilahn.</p><p>Sephie closes on Ilahn, and begins to drain Ilahn of his power. Believing the strength of his will is greater than her own, Ilahn presses into the connection, but is soon overwhelmed by Sephie greater resolve. She drains him of nearly every erg of power remaining to him, and rises stronger than ever before, dressed in armor of light.</p><p>With the little tiny bit of power remaining to him, Ilahn teleports himself away in an effort to rebuild his power. Sephie then tells her friends and crew that her time on Demetria is done, and that she knows her destiny. Sephie flies away from sight, into what fate has for her.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><h2 class=\"head\">Note on CrossGen Comics</h2><p>Meridian was one of the few CrossGen comics titles to come fully to a close before the company went bankrupt and ceased publishing.

    "deck": "Jad Takarty is a citizen of Meridian, one of the many floating islands of the planet Demetria. Jad and Sephie have been friends since they were young children, and Jad is deeply in love with her.",
    "description": "<p>Jad is the son of Meridian's militia leader Jon Takarty. Jad and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13193\" href=\"/sephie/4005-13193/\" slug=\"sephie\">Sephie</a>, daughter of Meridian's Minister grew up together, and are best friends. When Turos, Sephie's father is killed, and Ilahn of Cadador's army later invades his home, Jad is forced to leave his home and flee to safety.</p><p>Jad's heart wishes to go after Sephie, but his responsibility to his family and his fellow citizens overcomes his personal desires. Like most Meridianites, Jad knows his way around an air ship, but he is an expert sailor, and somewhat cocky and overconfident in his abilities. Because of this, Jad asks for and is given the bell ship, or guide ship duties as the Meridianite refugees look for a new home. Their search for a rumored island leads them into an incredibly dangerous area of Demetria, a section of the skies littered with thousands of floating islets. It takes all of Jad's considerable skill, along with the help of Feabie, another childhood friend, to navigate the treacherous skies and discover their new home, Hesperia.</p><p>After the refugees gain a semblance of peace and order, Jad sees his father, Jon, remarry and find increased happiness for the first time in years. Rumors have reached Hesperia that Sephie has fallen to her death, and so Jon Takarty unwillingly takes the reigns of leadership over the colony. Jad, however, does not believe the rumors, and is soon proven correct when the Muse of Giatan appears to the citizens of Hesperia and informs them that Sephie is not dead, only lost. In a moment of shock, the Muse inform Jad that he is the one who must find her. It is his destiny.</p><p>Jad and Feabie depart Hesperia on the search for Sephie. They eventually catch up with Sephie, and join her Pirates of the Wind. Jad becomes a complication for Sephie as her feeling for him distract her from her mission. Jad is warned by Deren Beq and the crew that he had better do his best to lessen the distraction, because her mission is far more important to the world than their feelings for one another. Crenner of Anheim is also jealous, but he never acts on his jealousy.</p><p>After the fall of Torbel, Sephie finally realizes that her care and concern for Jad has made her act less decisively. Sephie decides to part ways with Jad, asking him to pilot a captured ship back to Meridian, and then stay there as she continues her quest. Though angry and hurt, Jad complies with her wishes, rejoining the underground rebellion against the Cadadorian occupation of Meridian.</p><p>Among the refugees of Torbel taken in by Meridian is the consort of Ilahn, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42989\" href=\"/reesha-teramu/4005-42989/\" slug=\"reesha-teramu\">Reesha Teramu</a>. Jad is immediately suspicious of her, and his concern eventually bears fruit when the woman finally reveals the truth about herself. While a battle to the death ensues on the surface of Meridian between Ilahn and Sephie, Jad, Reesha and the other rebels and Torbelites make their way through the honeycomb of tunnels beneath the city. When confronted by a massive cave bear, Jad tries to distract the beast long enough for the others to get away. Jad is mortally wounded by the animal, but is miraculously healed and begins to exhibit powers akin to Sephie. The cave bear goes down in short order.</p><p>Before Jad can complete his next though, his attack from behind be Reesha, receiving a full force bolt of her lightning. Jad battles the woman briefly, allowing the refugees to escape before the cavern collapses on them from the unleashed fury of their attacks. When the cavern does fall, it breaks through the bottom of Meridian, sending Jad and Reesha plummeting toward the planets surface. Reesha escapes by calling on her benefactor, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42961\" href=\"/rhorf/4005-42961/\" slug=\"rhorf\">Rhorf</a>, but Jad is not as fortunate, and he falls to the ocean below.</p><p>After being rescued by a poor island fishing village, Jad makes a slow but steady recovery. The powers he somehow received from Sephie have disappeared, likely used up keeping him alive during his plunge from the skies. The fishing village owns only one airship, a small craft capable of carrying only two people at a time. The village's livelihood depends on the little boat, carrying their meager catches of fish to sell in the markets.</p><p>The tiny village is plagued by a giant mutated fish-like animal that patrols the local waters, making escape from the village by any means but by airship impossible. Jad strikes a deal with the village's leader. If he can successfully rid the village of the monster, they will give him the airship when it returns so he can return to Meridian. Jad takes the next few weeks studying the creatures habits, then launches his plan against the beast. Making his way into the monster's lair, he is swallowed by the thing, and the villagers believe him dead. Moments later, Jad cuts his way out of the monster's belly, killing it and delivering on his part of the bargain. Jad is given the boat and returns to Meridian.</p><p>Jad learns that Sephie has again departed Meridian. Now that Ilahn has been defeated, Jad believes he can return to Sephie's side and makes plans to do so. Jad's father and Regent, Jon, tells him that he has responsibilities on Meridian and cannot leave. Jad sneaks away anyway with Feabie in tow.</p><p>They make their way to Sephie's last known location, the island of Cadador. Not knowing the real political situation on the island, the pair are discovered and identified by Jad's nemesis, Reesha Teramu. Jad is seized by the Cadadorian authorities, and thrown in prison.</p><p>After receiving a beating by the prison guards—after he cockily mouths off to them—Feabie makes a rescue attempt. The attempt nearly fails when Feabie is discovered in Jad's cell by a Cadadorian soldier. This soldier turns out to be Brehn, a former Meridian who had been banished for some crime in his past. As part of his redemption and proof of the change in his character, Brehn has aided the Meridianites from inside the Cadadorian army once before. He does so again by aiding Jad and Feabie in their escape from the prison.</p><p>Feabie, who has been in love with Jad all this time, has finally had enough of his overarching concern for Sephie. As they are leaving the prison, Feabie abandons him and leaves in the company of Brehn, telling him to leave and go find Sephie. Before he can make good his escape, Jad is discovered by Reesha, only to reveal to Feabie that she is actually a citizen of Cadador and that she belongs and is welcome. Reesha takes Jad captive.</p><p>Jad is in the next moment whisked away by Ilahn during his final confrontation with Sephie. Ilahn and Reesha intend to use Jad as a human shield, believing Sephie would avoid harming Jad at all costs. Sephie is attacked from behind by Ilahn, and then Jad goads Reesha into joining the battle. Jad escapes from harm, and helps Sephie by distracting Reesha, who is subsequently killed by Ilahn. Ilahn is defeated, and teleports away to save himself and try to regain his power.</p><p>Jad is next seen saying goodbye to Sephie. Jad and the remaining Pirates of the Wind watch as Sephie literally flies off into the sunset, ostensibly to fight in the upcoming war for the fate of the universe.</p><h2 class=\"head\">Note on CrossGen Comics</h2><p>Meridian was one of the few CrossGen comics titles to come fully to a close before the company went bankrupt and ceased publishing. It is believed that Sephie would have played a major role in the Negation War title if the company had survived. The final fate of the Jad Takarty remains unknown.</p>",

He also developed the delusion that non-sentient machinery, such as automobiles, was speaking to him. Believing that machinery was intelligent and had feelings, he sought to protect it.  <h2>Creation</h2> <p>Doctor Goodwrench was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42450\" href=\"/dwayne-mcduffie/4040-42450/\">Dwayne McDuffie</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-14331\" href=\"/grant-miehm/4040-14331/\">Grant Miehm</a>. </p> <h2>Major Story Arcs</h2> <p>Dr. Goodwrench was first seen when he appeared at a West Coast Monster Truck Show which several members of the<a data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\" href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\"> Avengers West Coast </a>were hosting as a favor to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\" href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\">Wonder Man</a>. As various Monster Trucks and even a large, fire-breathing dinosaur, were used to smash each other, he made his presence known. He proclaimed himself the first Mechanical Rights Activist and that he was going to help machines get vengeance for centuries of abuse. He took control of the robot dinosaur and the Monster Trucks, causing it to attack the crowd. When the Avengers intercepted his attacks, he directed the machines and robots to attack them. He even took control of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\" href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\">Iron Man</a>'s armor, forcing him to attack the other Avengers. Ultimately the<a data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\" href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\"> Vision </a>confronted him, and convinced him that although machines should be treated with respect, that none of those he was manipulating were capable of talking to him. Realizing he was suffering from delusions, Dr. Goodwrench surrendered to the Avengers, who promised to get him psychiatric care.</p> <br /><h2>Powers</h2>Dr. Goodwrench is able to animate and manipulate machinery to do his bidding via mental command. He can also communicate with and control the functions of computers. This ability is even effective on the advanced armor of Iron Man. It is uncertain whether he could forcibly override the control of a sentient machine, such as a synthezoid like the Vision.",

While he has revealed he has been around since the Victorian Age , its unknown if he was active as a superhero or similar adventurer. In his civilian identity, he works as a builder by the name of John Smith, it is unknown if this is his real name.</p><p>It has been mentioned by other characters that Jack's record of success is a bit iffy; he often gets beaten up by supervillains and ends up in embarrassing or dangerous situations, such as being set-up to be arrested by the Spider.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Agile and acrobatic, the only clearly defined power of Jack Staff is his ability to move energy. This has been shown by his moving energy into his staff to break through solid walls, or move the anger from Hurricane. This ability is never clearly defined with regard to where the energy is moved from, or what kind of energy is involved.</p><p>Jack appears to be either immortal or very long lived. He reveals that he has been around since the at least the Victorian era. He was active as Jack Staff during World War II up until the 1980s when he retired after the Hurricane incident. He looks no different today then he did during World War II. No further background on him has yet to be revealed, although there have been hints of a connection with the \"Eternal Warrior\".</p><p>He has had dreams of some future threat, Becky Burdock is also plagued by the same thing, though it affects her more frequently.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>John Lopez was an chronic bed-wetter as a child, and was very much ashamed of this. In his teen years, he thought it became even worse. It however turned out that John was a mutant with aquatic powers. He could change his body into a aquatic-like state.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Washout was created by Peter Milligan and Duncan Fegredo and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-force-129-x-storm/4000-107076/\">X-Force issue 129 </a>(2002). He appeared again not much later in the pages of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/weapon-x-1-2-prelude/4000-223247/\">Weapon X #½ - Prelude</a> (2002).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>X-Force Try-Outs</h3><p>Discovering his mutant powers, John tried to join the media sensation mutant-team known as X-Force (later known as X-Statix). He adopted the superhero name Washout, and auditioned for the role. He was however met with laughter and his audition was no success. Leaving the X-Force compound bitter and saddened, John was approached by a man in a limousine. He had an offer to make John. He wanted him to be part of a new mutant group. John, with nowhere else to go, accepted the offer.</p><h3>Weapon X Crew</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3204496\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3204496-weaponx01013.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4966492926284\" data-width=\"1343\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1343px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3204496-weaponx01013.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3204496\"><img alt=\"As part of the Weapon X team\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/3204496-weaponx01013.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3204496-weaponx01013.jpg 1343w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/3204496-weaponx01013.jpg 1282w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/3204496-weaponx01013.jpg 641w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1282px) 100vw, 1282px\" data-width=\"1282\"></a><figcaption>As part of the Weapon X team</figcaption></figure><p>John had accepted the offer to become a part of a mutant group that was supposed to bring in his own kind. Although John saw this as far from what he wanted to do with his life, he accepted his role and became a teammember of the new Weapon X mutant crew. He had several missions with the team, growing in his role as a mutant tracker. It was however during this time that John noticed his powers going haywire, sometimes being unable to return to his human state after having been in his aquatic state. It was during a fight with the Mutant Underground, which sought to destroy the new Weapon X faccility, that John's powers let up, and he disintegrated in front of his teammates.</p>",

She is an excellent student, but has little common sense.</p><p>Inoue harbors a perpetual crush on Ichigo Kurosaki, which she cannot bring herself to confront him about; later in the series, she admits to herself that she has outright fallen in love with him. She isn't a good chef but will often attempt to cook for herself or her friends on a regular basis. She has an extremely active imagination, resulting in many of her friends not taking her outlandish claims seriously, even when they ultimately turn out to be true.</p><p>Despite being somewhat scatterbrained around her friends, Inoue has shown to possess an innate ability to sense how others are feeling and is very good at reading others' behavior to determine their mental and emotional states. She is particularly empathic towards Ichigo and is very good at reading his mood by his nonverbal gestures.</p><p>.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>The Substitute Story Arc</h3><p>The first time Inoue is seen is in the series she is talking to some of her school mates about why</p><p><a href=\"/ichigo/4005-42468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\"> Ichigo</a></p><p>is late for school. After Ichigo accepts the role of Soul Reaper, Inoue begins to be attacked by the</p><p><a href=\"/hollows/4060-43024/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43024\"> Hollow</a></p><p>known as Acidwire. Since Orihime had no Spiritual Powers at the time she didn't know that they attacks where from an outside force and chalked it up to her clumsiness.</p><p>Later that night Orihime and Tatsuki are at the house her house discussing Ichigo and his past when Acidwire attacks again, this time attempting to kill Tatsuki first. At the same time Ichigo is making his way across time to help save his friends and reveals to</p><p><a href=\"/rukia-kuchiki/4005-46355/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46355\"> Rukia</a></p><p>that he recognized the Hollow that was attacking Orihime.</p><p>Ichigo explains that Orihime had a brother that was quite a bit older than her when she was you. It turns out that Orihime's brother took her and ran from their parents house when she was a young child so that they couldn't abuse her anymore. Finally, Ichigo reveals that her brother died one morning when he was hit by a car and despite Orihime's efforts to drag him to Ichigo's family's clinic.</p><p>Orihime tries to help Tatsuki, but can't see the Hollow that has attacked them, and ends up having her soul shoved out of her. Once she is out of her body and only connected by her Chain of Fate Orihime can make out the battle that is happening between Ichigo and Acidwire.</p><p>After a missed attack from Ichigo, Acidwire's mask is partially removed and she sees the face of her attacker, she is shocked to see that Acidwire is actually her older brother Sora Inoue. It is here that Sora reveals that he became a Hollow after Orihime began to spend less time praying for and talking to her brother, but instead began to talk about her new friends.</p><p>Orihime also tells her brother that the only day she choose not to wear the hair pins that Sora bought her was the same day they had argued and he was killed. As her brother turns to attack again Orihime opens her arms and allows her brother to bite her while she hugs him and apologizes for having made him feel lonely.</p><p>Orihime reveals that she was only trying to keep Sora involved with her life after he had died and therefore talked about her friends with him so he would now that she was happy. Sora apologizes to his little sister and punctures his own head with Ichigo's Zanpaktou so that he can be cleansed and pass onto the Soul Society to wait for Orihime to join him.</p><h3>Battle of the Rubicon</h3><p>When Orihime is seen in this story arc she is first being complimented for her high seat in the school academic standings, and then being teased for her lack of common sense. When Ichigo is at school the day after he met</p><p><a href=\"/uryu-ishida/4005-42857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42857\"> Uryu Ishida</a></p><p>trying to remember Uryu's name Orihime over hears his muttering and helps him find Uryu.</p><p>Orihime leads Ichigo through the school and to the Sewing Crafts Club. Orihime explains that Uryu is a very kind person even if he does get somewhat rude.</p><p>After Uryu challenges Ichigo to a Hollow destroying contest Orihime is at the school waiting for Tatsuki to get done with karate practice when they are attacked by another Hollow. This time the Hollow named Numb Chandelier pelts the school with it's spores that infect other students and subjugates them to Numb Chandelier's commands.</p><p>After infecting most of the students at the school Numb Chandelier sends his minions after Orihime. After the mob converges on Orhime she is saved by her friend Tatsuki for the second time in her life. Nub Chandelier proves too strong for Tatsuki though and infects her too, sending her after Orihime too.</p><p>Numb Chandelier's callous assault causes Orihime's spirit powers to awaken and manifest themselves as the Six Flowers of The Hibiscus Shield.

href=\"/renji-abarai/4005-43022/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43022\"> Renji</a> and <a href=\"/byakuya-kuchiki/4005-44098/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44098\"> Byakuya Kuchiki</a>, Chad is recruited by <a

the Hollow's world.</p><p>Chad and Uryu first battle two Arrancar to prove that they are worthy of helping in their mission, taking on Iceringer and Demora.</p><p>After struggling with Iceringer Chad

This arm was originally used mostly for energy blasts, but during battle in Hueco Mundo he eventually realizes that this arm was intended for defense and not attack.</p><p>*Left Arm of the Devil*</p><p>After his Right Arm of the Giant reaches it's third evolution Chad's left arm evolves too.</p><p>With his Left Arm of the Devil Chad gains a sleeve that has the opposite color scheme as is Right Arm's original design. This is to reflect its opposite purpose to his left arm: his right arm is intended for attack, something that had previously been against his nature. Chad realizes in Hueco Mundo that he cannot be passive and only defend: to rescue Inoue he needed to take the offensive in battle, especially when alone.</p><p>When his left arm manifests though Chad gains several spikes on his chest and shoulder instead of the wings that his right arm had.</p><p>To attack with his Left Arm of the Devil Chad only has to punch his opponent and a gigantic skull looking energy ball is released on contact.</p><p>Both of Chads arms are based on his desire to protect others and only when he wants them to manifest will the arms appear.</p><p>Chad has an inhuman amount of strength and has demonstrated his power when he tore a tree pole out of the ground and used it as a club against a Hollow that was chasing him and Shibata.</p><p>Chad's intelligence is demonstrated in the stories when the class ranking is posted and he is posted as 11 out of some three hundred students.</p><p>Since Chad's powers manifest themselves as sleeves Chad has no weapons to attack with and relies on his abilities as a hand- to- hand fighter.</p><p>When using his spirit powers Chad can sense other people's spirit powers and can even sense where Hollows are and hunt them down using his spirit sense.</p><p>In the manga Chad's grandfather mentions that Chad will be singled out by some of the other people he meets in life because they are jealous of his size, strength, and looks. He is told by his grandfather that his size and strength are however not a tool to use for the benefit of others: rather they are a gift that should be used to help those he cares for. Chad's grandfather is thus a very important person in Chads development: many of his life philosophies and guidelines are passed down from his grandfather.</p>",

His most notable accessories are his traditional wooden sandals, stripped fisherman's hat and cane. It is apparent that he has not use of the cane as an aide to walk, but we soon find out it is in fact his zanpakuto disguised as a walking cane.</p><p>Kisuke has a rather carefree attitude and behavior, but behind most people's backs he is a schemer. Despite this, Kisuke normally talks to others in a pleasant manner. however this mannerism can sometimes be used to as way to mock an enemy. He tends to be very light hearted about situations but always know when to turn from free spirited to serious.</p><p>As an owner of his own store, Kisuke is never short of supplies. The shop however is used as a front for his real operations where he can gather and sell Soul Reaper technology. Underground his store, he has a concealed training center. It would prove handy in helping <a href=\"/ichigo-kurosaki/4005-42468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\">Ichigo</a> regain his Shinigami powers after his first encounter with <a href=\"/byakuya-kuchiki/4005-44098/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44098\">Byakua Kuchiki</a>. The underground training center has proved useful for Ichigo's other friends and allies including <a href=\"/yasutora-sado/4005-43020/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43020\">Chad</a>, <a href=\"/uryu-ishida/4005-42857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42857\">Ishida</a> and <a href=\"/renji-abarai/4005-43022/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43022\">Renji</a>.</p><p>Kisuke has a wealth of knowledge of both the world of the living and spirit realms. Despite this he tends to hide a lot of what he knows from the people he tends to work with, making it hard to truly trust him. Normally found working behind the scenes, he can be considered as an exceptional tactician handing out tasks to ensure main goals are met.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Kisuke was originally a Soul Reapers captain, but ended up being exiled from the Soul Society after some of his inventions didn't go over too well with the other Soul Reapers.</p><p>Kisuke created a gigai, artificial body that most Soul Reapers use when they are injured and have to hide from Hollows, that slowly drains the Soul Reaper's spirit powers until they become a normal human.</p><p>Inside the gigai is the Orb of Destruction that Urahara was exiled for making.</p><p>When Urahara fled the Soul Society he was accompanied by Yoruichi Shihouin, who hides her true appearance by turning into a cat.</p><p>After leaving the Soul Society Kisuke came to the human world and began to make Soul Reaper technology that other Soul Reapers could use if they were in need of assistance, but couldn't get back to the Soul Society.</p><p>Kisuke actually recreates the gigai that he was expelled for creating and gives it to Rukia Kuchiki.</p><p>During the Battle of the Rubicon story arc, Kisuke actually gathers together his shop assists, Tessai Tsukabishi, Ururu Tsumugiya, and Jinta Hankari, and heads out to the city to help kill Hollows.</p><p>Kisuke actually intervenes only to help Ichigo and Uryu focus on fighting together again the Menos Grande that appears.</p><p>Kisuke even stops Rukia from interfering in the battle so that she can see just how much power Ichigo has.</p><p>Shortly after that Kisuke lets Ichigo go into battle with Renji Abarai and Byakuya, but stays out of the fight so that Ichigo can learn exactly how much he still needs to learn about a true Soul Reaper's strength.</p><p>He doesn't allow Ichigo to die from his wounds though.</p><p>Kisuke take Ichigo back to his shop and nurses him back to health, and even convinces Ichigo to train under him to save Rukia.</p><p>After making medicine to help heal the wounds that Byiakuya used to shatter Ichigo's power sources Kisuke creates the underground training center in the human world.</p><p>Once Ichigo begins his training Kisuke uses exercise that he made to help Ichigo gain even more power than he had before.</p><p>First Kisuke forces Ichigo's soul out of his body and pits him in an exercise where Ichigo must land one hit on Ururu, a small quite girl.</p><p>After Ichigo begins the exercise and somehow manages to land one punch on Ururu Kisuke reveals that he can fight at a Soul Reaper's level.</p><p>For the second exercise Kisuke has Tessai cut Ichigo's Chain of Fate, bind his arms, and drop him in a pit.</p><p>Kisuke explains that Ichigo must find a way out of the pit with out his arms to gain back his Soul Reaper's powers, he also explains that if Ichigo fails he will become a Hollow.</p><p>After almost three days Ichigo's Chain of Fate disappears, but he manages to make it of the hole and begins Kisuke's next exercise.</p><p>The third Exercise requires Ichigo to draw his Zanpakuto and knock Kisuke's hat off his head.</p><p>After chasing revealing that his cane is infact Benihime, his own Zanpakuto, Kisuke chases and attacks Ichigo until Ichigo makes a connection with his sword and draws his true Zanpakuto, Zangetsu.</p><p>Kisuke laments the lose of his hat after the exercise, but moves on with his plan to invade the Soul Society to free Rukia.</p><p>Later it is revealed that before entering the Soul Society Kisuke sparred with Ichigo for ten days and nights, forcing him to gain battle experience.</p><p>After he is finished training Ichigo Kisuke makes the portal needed for the others to enter the Soul Society.</p><p>Kisuke doesn't join the team because his Soul is refused access to the Soul Society.</p><h2>Agent of the Shinigami Arc</h2><p>After Rukia Kuchiki transfers her Shinigami powers to Ichigo. Urahara later then gives Rukia a gigai, which later is revealed to be a special gigai that would slowly drain her Reiatsu (spiritual pressure) and turn her into a human. Though this never happens, but it came pretty close. Rukia later buys an artificial soul to take Ichigo's place when he turns into a Shinigami, to make his life easier for the time being.</p><p>Later in the series Rukia goes to Urahara for information about the Quincy race. He reveals how the Quincy were hunted to almost extinction due to fear from the Shinigami.</p><h2>History In The Dark</h2><p>During the The Pendulum Turns Back Time storyline a large portion of Kisuke's history is revealed. As it turns out Kisuke was once a third seat within Yoruichi's Special Forces and was set over the Third Division as the head of the Detention Unit. As Kisuke explains it he was in charge of keeping the dangerous elements of the Soul Society away from the rest of the people. Kisuke moves on though and becomes a captain himself when he takes over the twelfth division after the previous captain ascends the ranks to become a Royal Guard. After taking over the Twelfth Division Kisuke is appointed his new team including the hot headed Hiyori. Kisuke receives a hostile greeting to his new position as Hiyori refuses to accept him as the new captain of the twelfth division.</p><p>In an attempt to get Hiyori to understand him better Kisuke takes her with him to his old assignment the maggot's nest, a prison for only the most troublesome and possibly powerful enemies of the Soul Society. Once inside Kisuke begins to explain to Hiyori that no one ever truly leaves the Soul Reaper army, but rather the ones who are deemed unsuitable to continue on there are removed and locked up so that they can't use their powers to attack the Soul Society. Kisuke also reveals that he is powerful enough without his zanpakuto to stop any convict in the Nest with only his hands. Finally Kisuke explains the whole reason for the visit is to recruit a new seated officer for his research division, Kurotsuchi Mayuri. With his new officer at his side Kisuke begins to prepare his division for his vision to be able to efficiently collect data and use it in a way that they best aid the rest of the Soul Reapers. Unfortunately time is against Kisuke as a new threat looms on the horizon. After several reports of souls disappearing outside of the Soul Society a team is gathered and sent out to investigate the phenom. After a report is sent back to report that Soul Reapers have also been abducted the Captains gather and send out an investigating team to see what info can be gathered and used. Despite Kisuke's pleas to be sent to protect Hiyori since he had sent her to gather info for him his request is denied. Shinji Hirako offers to make sure she is safely returned with himself and the other officers that are being sent out. Luck continues to work against Kisuke though as the rescue team is quickly faced by the threat of a Captain Soul Reaper that is now infected with a disease that makes him behave and appear much like a Hollow. As member after member is infected by the disease Shinji is left alone to find that Aizen is responsible for the outbreak. Before Aizen, Tosen, and Ichimaru can kill off the officers though Kisuke, using a coat he developed to hide his reiatsu, and Tsukabishi arrive to do what they can to stop or at least stall the death blows from happening. Before Kisuke can stop Aizen though Tessai Tsukabishi steps in and attacks using an 88th level destruction spell.

    "deck": "Renji Abarai is the lieutenant for the sixth division's captain, Byakuya Kuchiki. Renji is also close with Rukia Kuchiki. Renji is very brash and tends to annoy and be annoyed by Ichigo Kurosaki. His zanpakuto is called Zabimaru.",
    "description": "<h2>General Information</h2><ul><li><b>Birthday</b>: August 31</li><li><b>Height</b>: 6'2\" (188cm)</li><li><b>Weight</b>: 78 Kg</li><li><b>Eyes</b>: Brow</li><li><b>Hair</b>: Red</li></ul><p>Renji Abarai is the 6th Division lieutenant of the Soul Reaper's army. Renji is close friends with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46355\" href=\"/rukia-kuchiki/4005-46355/\">Rukia Kuchiki</a>, rivals with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\" href=\"/ichigo/4005-42468/\">Ichigo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44098\" href=\"/byakuya-kuchiki/4005-44098/\">Byakuya</a>.</p><p>Like most Soul Reapers officers Renji is very dedicated to the Soul Society's beliefs and upholds them when they are threatened.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Renji is a tall man with long red hair kept up in a pony tail. Besides the typical Soul Reaper uniform Renji tends to either wear a visor or a bandanna over his forehead.</p><p>He usually keeps his hair pulled back since it is long and could easily impair his ability to see in a fight.</p><p>Where most people have eyebrows Renji has tattoos, which also spread across most of his upper body.</p><p>When Renji is in the human world he stays in a gigai that resembles his real appearance unless he needs to fight.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Renji is a cocky, hot headed and headstrong individual, but he has moments where he able to calm himself and apply logic in his decisions. Renji is fiercely loyal to his friends and will go to any lengths to protect them, including fighting, killing and dying for them. He is shown to be a very determined character, and he does not give up at something when he sets his mind to it. Renji is fond of sunglasses and usually wears them when he is off duty. He buys the sunglasses from a popular store in Soul Society and spends half of his annual paycheck on them.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Based on Renji and Rukia's oldest revealed memories they were both originally from the Soul Society's 78th district.</p><p>Renji grew up as an orphan in Rukongai and lived with Rukia and several friends on the streets, though he could have joined the Soul Reapers while he was young because of his natural spirit powers.</p><p>Renji didn't abandon his friends to join the Soul Reapers, but waited until they had each passed away instead.</p><p>In the Soul Reaper Academy Renji showed great talent as a swordsmen, though lacked control when it came to Kido. He soon joined the elite class alongside Izuru Kira and Momo Hinamori</p><p>While on a training exercise Renji and several of his peers, including Izuru Kira, and Momo Hinamori, manage to save several of the other cadets from a real Hollow that attacks the class.</p><p>After graduating the Academy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42859\" href=\"/sosuke-aizen/4005-42859/\">Sosuke Aizen</a> made the three of them members of the 5th Division.</p><p>When Aizen realised Renji had a predisposition towards rebellion and using him could be detrimental too Aizen's plans he moved Renji to the 11th Division.</p><p>While in the combat division Renji fought alongside <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49545\" href=\"/ikkaku-madarame/4005-49545/\">Ikkaku Madarame</a>, he quickly realised Ikkaku had already achieved Bankai and convinced Ikkaku to make him his student.</p><p>Ikkaku taught all that he knew about fighting to Renji, helping Renji to climb up the ranks until he was transferred again.</p><p>This time Renji was brought into the 6th Division where he served under Byakuya Kuchiki, whom he eventually became lieutenant for.</p><h2>Soul Society Story Arc</h2><p>After the Soul Reapers noticed that a Menos Grande, one of the most powerful forms for a Hollow, was stopped not by a Soul Reaper, but rather a Human Quincy and a Human Spirit a two man team was sent to find the Soul Reaper responsible for human's Soul Reapper's powers.</p><p>Information is passed on to the 6th Division captain and lieutenant, Byakuya and Renji, that the cause of all the trouble was in fact Rukia and Ichigo. Renji and Byakuya eventually catch up with Rukia and attempt to bring her back, but are slowed down by Uryu's interference.</p><p>The fight is short, not even shown in the manga but rather implied to only lasts as long as it takes Ichigo to find them. Renji attacks Ichigo and even reveals that he can perform his initial release while Ichigo can't use his full Soul Reaper's powers. Despite giving Ichigo several injuries and taunting him for his inabilities, Ichigo manages to gain the upperhand on Renji after drawing upon more of his hidden power. Renji is saved at the last second as Byakuya steps in and stops Ichigo. After the fight with Ichigo Renji opens the door to the Soul Society and Rukia, Byakuya, and himself return to the other side. Once back in the Soul Society Renji visits Rukia regularly, bringing her news as to what her punishment is going to be for illegally transferring power to a human. When Ichigo, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43020\" href=\"/yasutora-sado/4005-43020/\">Chad</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42857\" href=\"/uryu-ishida/4005-42857/\">Uryu</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43019\" href=\"/orihime-inoue/4005-43019/\">Orihime</a> invade the Soul Society Renji prepares himself for a rematch with Ichigo. Unlike their first fight Renji is overtaken by Ichigo quickly this time, forcing him to finally accept that he needs to push himself to a new level. Before allowing Ichigo to leave, though, Renji makes Ichigo promise to save Rukia. After the fight Byakuya scolds Renji for going alone to face Ichigo and leaves him in prison to heal. While recovering from the battle Renji is confronted by his Zanpakuto's spirit, Zabimaru. Renji promises Zabimaru he will become stronger and will help to save Rukia. Renji breaks himself out of prison and hunts down Ichigo so that he can aid him to reach his Bankai. Renji finds Ichigo in another of Kisuke Urahara's underground caverns and that he is already trying to learn his Bankai. Renji explains that his Bankai training is already quite advanced and goes off in the cavern to finish his training on his own. After a few days of training Renji leaves the cavern shortly before Ichigo to find and free Rukia. Before he can get to the execution stand Renji is met by Byakuya, who refuses to allow him to pass without first defeating him. Renji attacks Byakuya using his initial release first and then reveals his Zanpakuto's Bankai form. Renji fights his hardest, but still falls short of Byakuya and his Bankai. Renji survives the battle though, and even manages to make Byakuya go to one knee before he loses. Renji is saved by a member of the Soul Reapers medical division and his wounds are healed before he sets out to save Rukia again. By the time Renji arrives at the execution block Ichigo has already saved Rukia from her demise. After seeing Ichigo save Rukia Renji is taken off guard by Ichigo's throwing Rukia at him like a fast ball. Despite his injuries Renji manages to catch Rukia and makes a run with Rukia before he is stopped by Kaname Tosen. After having run all the way to the base of the execution plateau Renji and Rukia find themselves back at the execution scaffolding. Renji then finds out that Aizen has been manipulating all of the decisions in Rukia's trial to obtain the Orb of Distortion that had been placed in her by Urahara when Rukia received a gigai from him. Renji, Ichigo and Byakuya try to protect Rukia from Aizen and Gin before they escape with the orb into Huenco Mondo, the world the Hollows hide in when not in the human world or the Soul Society.</p><h2>Arrancar Story Arc</h2><p>During the Arrancar storyline Ichigo receives help from Rukia, Renji, and several other Soul Reapers arrive to assist in the battles. Renji eventually goes into battle with Ilforte Grantz, a weaker Arrancar in comparison to others like Grimmjow. While Renji is fighting he can't use his full power in the human world because he is held at about a quarter of his true power. After using even his Bankai release things look rather grim for Renji, until he gets some help from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50472\" href=\"/ururu-tsumugiya/4005-50472/\">Ururu Tsumugiya</a> ( <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43021\" href=\"/kisuke-urahara/4005-43021/\">Kisuke Urahara's</a> mousy assistant girl.) Renji finally has his power suppression removed and fights back at full power and even manages to kill Ilforte.</p><p>After the battle against Grimmjow's Arrancar Urahara pursuades Renji to take Chad on as his student, as sparring against him in Bankai form would allow both of them to greatly increase their power. Having expanded their energy training however, neither Chad nor Renji were able to join the battle against the Arrancar when next they attacked Karakura Town.</p><p>After Orihime is kidnapped by the Espada the Head Captain orders the soldiers stationed in Karakura Town to all withdraw to the Seireitei, captains Zaraki and Kuchiki were dispatched to take them by force should they refuse orders. We later learn however that Kuchiki allowed Rukia and Renji to go to Orihime's rescue after returning to Soul Society. They join up with Ichigo's group in Hueco Mundo.</p><h2>Zanpakuto</h2><p>Renji's zanpakuto is called Zabimaru. It's initial release changes it from a regular katana. to a sword that has several section sections that are connected by several coils connecting them.</p><h3>Shikai:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2372/104746-169704-renji-arabai.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-104746\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 200px\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2372/104746-169704-renji-arabai.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-104746\"><img alt=\"Zabimaru's first release.\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2372/104746-169704-renji-arabai.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2372/104746-169704-renji-arabai.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></a><figcaption>Zabimaru's first release.</figcaption></figure><p>Zabimaru in it's initial release form can be used as a whip or as a sword.</p><p>While being used like a whip Zabimaru has an almost limitless reach, and is very flexible.</p><p>When Renji is in dire trouble he has a third use for Zabimaru where he makes the Zanpakuto explode into independent segments that all attack at the same time from multiple directions.</p><p>This is an attack that Renji hates to use unless he absolutely has to resort to using as it hurts Zabimaru and leaves Renji wide open for attacks.</p><h3>Bankai:</h3><p>In Zambimaru's Bankai, the zanpakuto turns into a snake- like skeleton that is connected by spiritual energy that Renji feeds to Zambimaru.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2372/104745-189777-renji-arabai.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-104745\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2372/104745-189777-renji-arabai.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-104745\"><img alt=\"Zabimaru's Bankai form.\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2372/104745-189777-renji-arabai.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2372/104745-189777-renji-arabai.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Zabimaru's Bankai form.</figcaption></figure><p>While attacking in his Bankai form Zabimaru has the ability to stretch over long distances and behaves like a snake.</p><p>If anyone one section of Zabimaru is damaged during a fight Renji can make it drop out of the formation and reconstruct the rest of Zabimaru with his spirit power.</p><p>Zabimaru also has the option of sending a high powered spirit energy blast out of it's mouth when Renji fully masters his zanpakuto.</p><p>Zabimaru's true form is a baboon with a snake for a tail.</p><p>The baboon form is usually the one that responds, but the snake tends to be the one who is aggressive.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Renji has since the start of story reached the level of a captain in combat prowess.</p><ul><li>Master Swordsmanship</li><li>High Spiritual Power</li><li>Shunpo Expert</li><li>Kido Practitioner</li><li>Enhanced Strength</li><li>Enhanced Speed</li><li>Enhanced Durability</li></ul>",

Thus he created <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3418\" href=\"/firehawk/4005-3418/\">  Firehawk</a>, whom he sent to destroy Firestorm.  After he was sure that the test was successful, he performed the nuclear explosion on himself.  He thus went from being a quadriplegic invalid to becoming one of Firestorm’s most formidable and haunting foes, Tokamak, the Living Nuclear Reactor.</p><p>Eventually defeated and seemingly killed by Firestorm, Hewitt and his Tokamak identity fell into obscurity for years, appearing only in flashbacks and group shots of Firestorm's rogues gallery.  It was revealed in the “In My Father’s House” arc in the most recent Firestorm series that Hewitt had actually undertaken extreme measures before his death to insure that his legacy would continue.  He made many and varied clones of himself, chief among them his “son,” Victor Hewitt.  Victor is an outwardly Vietnamese-American man who inherited the business empire - as well as all the evil will and powers - of his “father.”  He was responsible for many of the major mishaps and villains encountered by Jason Rusch throughout Stuart Moore’s run as writer on the series, which culminated in an all-out battle between Tokamak, his dollies, Firestorm, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43047\" href=\"/gehenna/4005-43047/\"> Gehenna</a>, and Firehawk.</p>",

    "description": "<h2> History</h2><p>Gehenna (pronounced juh-HEHN-uh) is a female, Asian-American hero in the supporting cast of  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2353\" href=\"/firestorm/4005-2353/\">  Firestorm</a>.  She appears to be an older teen, but she is actually six or seven years old; this is somewhat demonstrated in her maturity, but she is for the most part accepted as a near-adult.  She can teleport over small distances, and has a psychic connection with members of the Firestorm matrix, most notably <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2353\" href=\"/firestorm/4005-2353/\">  Jason Rusch</a> and Martin Stein.</p><p>She was first introduced in Villains United No. 5 and Firestorm, Vol. 3, No. 17 (a tie-in to that issue) in which she and Firestorm are rescued by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-38149\" href=\"/secret-six/4060-38149/\">  Secret Six</a> from powering a South American base for the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40433\" href=\"/secret-society-of-super-villains/4060-40433/\">  Secret Society of Super Villains</a>.  She immediately attached herself to Jason, who was at the time unable to become Firestorm fully, as his girlfriend.  She explained her age, and that she had been living in seclusion with her father, who remained unknown for much of her role in the series.  She was very jealous of other women and upset over Jason's seeming lack of affection for her at various points, most notably when he went to space with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4913\" href=\"/donna-troy/4005-4913/\">  Donna Troy</a> during the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\" href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\">  Infinite Crisis</a>.  Nevertheless, she moved to New York with Jason after he returned from space, and has been living happily (if not without incident) since, occasionally lending her abilities to his various heroic escapades. </p>During Blackest Night. Gehenna was turned into salt and killed by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50743\" href=\"/black-lantern-corps/4060-50743/\">  Black Lantern</a> Ronnie Raymond. However she has recently appeared to Ronnie Raymond during Brightest Day. While Ronnie is in his room Gehenna appears, calling his name. She then grabs him by the throat, and demands he say her name. As another student walks in the room, Gehenna disperses into a cloud of salt, leaving it all around the room. <br /> <br /><h2>Powers and Abilities </h2>Limited teleportation, and psychic connection with the Firestorm matrix.",

    "deck": "A nazi scientist. He was part of Project Ragna Rok and the Nazi Space Program. He spent most of his life as a flying head in a jar.",
    "description": "<p>Herman von Klempt is a villain created by writer/artist Mike Mignola for the Dark Horse Comics series Hellboy. He first appeared in the Comics Buyer's Guide.</p><p> </p><p>A German scientist, von Klempt was a close colleague of Karl Ruprecht Kroenen at university. Although the two men apparently shared similar ideas, Von Klempt was not, like Kroenen, recruited by Rasputin as a disciple. Von Klempt was assigned to other Nazi projects.</p><p>During the Second World War, and especially during the final years, when Germany faced defeat, Adolf Hitler launched a series of what the Allies called \"Doomsday Projects,\" attempts to combine science with black magic. Among these was Project <i>Vampir Sturm</i> (1944, proposed by Heinrich Himmler); Project Ragna Rok (The Fatal Destiny), which resulted in the appearance of Hellboy in a church in East Bromwich, England (December 23, 1944); and, lastly, the Nazi Space Program.</p><p>The Nazi Space Program was initiated in or around 1939, when German scientists managed to make contact with non-corporeal beings in outer space (which Hellboy, half-facetiously, nicknamed \"space ghosts\"). These beings promised that, if a human shell was sent into space to provide a host for them, it would return to Earth powerful enough to destroy the Nazis' enemies.</p><p>The Nazis prepared to launch into space the remains of Dr. Ernst Oeming, a German physicist often referred to as the \"Nazi Einstein,\" who had been assassinated by a car bomb earlier that year. The launch platform was Hunte Castle in Austria.</p><p>On the night of March 20, 1939, the date Oeming's body was to be launched, the American hero Lobster Johnson led a group of American troops in an attack on Hunte Castle. In a state of panic, the Nazis launched Oeming's ship before the roof's doors could open. Although the rocket cleared the castle and made it into space, the explosion resulted in the immediate incineration of everyone inside the castle except one man: Herman von Klempt.</p><p>Although most of his body was destroyed, his head was kept alive in a jar, which was attached to a robotic body. Von Klempt also created what he called a <i>Kriegsaffe</i> (German, \"war ape\"), a sort of Frankenstein's monster-like ape, to be his henchman. At some point he had a swastika tattooed to his forehead.</p><h3>B.P.R.D : 1946</h3><p>in 1946 Von Klempt was working for the <i>Vampir Sturm</i> project. He was confronted by Prof. Bruttenholm, who was young at the time, and set two of his Kriegaffen upon him. Von Klepmt's head was attached to a set of mechanical spider legs that allowed him to move about on his own. Bruttenholm defeated the large Apes as they battled in a rocket that had launched from the ground and managed to push Von Klempt out, who then fell to the ground.</p><h3>Comic buyer's guide</h3><p>Von Klempt escaped Europe after the war and retreated to a base in the jungle near Macapá, Brazil, where he began working on other projects. It was there in 1959 that he was confronted by Hellboy, who was investigating the disappearance of peasant girls in the area (von Klempt had been drawing fluid from their spinal columns in order to prolong his life). In the fight that ensued, Hellboy defeated von Klempt and his <i>Kriegsaffe</i>, \"Brutus\". Von Klempt's inert head would not be seen for decades.</p><h3>Wake the Devil</h3><p>Von Klempt's old friend and colleague, Kroenen, had placed himself in suspended animation with Ilsa Haupstein and Leopold Kurtz, two other members of the Ragna Rok Project. Asleep in a Norwegian castle, they were awoken in 1994 by Roderick Zinco, with the intent of carrying out the deceased Rasputin's agenda. Secretly, Kroenen sent Zinco to Brazil to retrieve von Klempt's head.</p><p>After being revived, von Klempt tried to convince Kroenen to abandon Rasputin's plan to awaken the Ogdru Jahad, and instead use Zinco's resources to retrieve von Klempt's projects in South America, which he promised could let them rule the world. Overhearing, Kurtz began attacking von Klempt's head, and Kroenen killed Kurtz in a panic. Furious at von Klempt and Kroenen, Rasputin's ghost blinded Zinco, who accidentally set off an explosion that destroyed the castle.</p><h3>Conqueror Worm</h3><p>Somehow surviving the castle's detonation, von Klempt's head retreated to a secret laboratory under a graveyard in Germany. There he began work on his <i>Kriegaffe</i> #10, but was suddenly stricken with despair over the seemingly endless failures of his life and the loss of his purpose: Hitler's Third Reich had collapsed, as had all his plans for world domination. In this moment of weakness, he was contacted by Rasputin's ghost, whom von Klempt mistakenly believed to be the Angel of Death. Rasputin reminded von Klempt of the Nazi Space Project, and showed him the destruction that would be unleashed if Dr. Oeming's capsule could be returned to Earth, and the thing that now inhabited his body was released. Von Klempt, finally given purpose - to watch the destruction of the world - returned after sixty years to Hunte Castle.</p><p>Secretly, Rasputin's aim was still the same: once the world had been overtaken, the Ogdru Hem would be released from their prisons, and they would, in turn, release the Ogdru Jahad, who would reduce the world to ashes.</p><p>Von Klempt contacted his granddaughter, Inger. Believing that they were unlocking a power that would help them rule the world, Inger helped her grandfather to restore the equipment at Hunte Castle and recall Dr. Oeming's capsule to Earth.</p><p>A gigantic creature called \"The Conqueror Worm\" surged forth from the capsule. Spewing a noxious gas, the worm turned von Klempt's human agents into frog-men, then devoured them immediately to feed its insatiable hunger. Only quick intervention by Hellboy and Roger the Homunculus, aided by the ghost of Lobster Johnson, managed to halt the worm's march. Von Klempt was pulled off of a cliff by Roger; the madman's jar was smashed and his life came to an end.</p>",

    "deck": "LeHah is a international arms dealer and thug, stealing funds from the Order of St. Dumas.  LeHah was Azrael's first archnemesis, donning the raiment of the Demon Lord Biis.",
    "description": "<p>Carlton LeHah was the treasurer for the Sacred Order of St. Dumas until he decided to use the funds of the Order to further his own greed.  He began a business in international weapons sales, and was extremely successful.  The Order eventually caught on to his actions and dispatched an Azrael, Ludovic Valley, to bring him in.  LeHah shot and killed this Azrael, but not before he crawled to the home of his son, Jean-Paul Valley, who then became the new - and best known - Azrael.  LeHah tracked Jean-Paul to Europe and attempted to kill him and end the line of Azraels there, but an unexpected explosion forced LeHah’s helicopter to crash into the mountainous wilderness.  There he had a demonic “revelation” of unsure legitimacy, which then led him to follow the Demon Lord Biis, the traditional archenemy of the angel Azrael in the mythology of the Order.  Thereafter, he often impersonated the Demon Lord when carrying out his various evil schemes.</p><p>Pursuing Azrael further and systematically wiping out most of the leaders of the Order of St. Dumas, he came into contact with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\">Batman</a>, whom he captured and tortured until Azrael rescued him, with help from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5556\" href=\"/alfred/4005-5556/\">Alfred</a> and the dwarf, Nomoz.  He continued to be a thorn in the sides of both Azrael and Batman for some time afterward.  During Jean-Paul’s time as Batman, his attempt to kill LeHah provided the stage for the penultimate battle between Jean-Paul and Bruce to determine who would wear the Mantle of the Bat at the end of the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40761\" href=\"/knightfall/4045-40761/\">Knightfall</a> Saga.</p>",

Accosted by a man one evening, she taps into something primal, an instinct she never knew she had. She becomes the predator and he the prey. Terrified at the result, she seeks help. What she finds is a man who believes insists that she is the victim of a curse, as is he.</p><p>68 British men slaughtered and plundered a village and Naga temple in colonial India, centuries ago. To mete out vengeance, a Naga spirit cursed the spirits of each of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43239\" href=\"/the-68/4060-43239/\" slug=\"the-68\">The 68</a> to be reincarnated over and over, until that generation's incarnation of a deadly Snake Woman could kill every one of them. No Snake Woman yet has survived long enough to complete the task. The question now is: will Jessica?</p><p>When Jessica is confronted with extreme emotional stress, one of The 68 or a symbol from their first voyage, something primal and reptilian awakes in her. Its physical manifestation can be as slight as her eyes becoming slitted and green to growing razor-sharp claws where her hands used to be. Torn between her human side (ethics, morals, intellect) and her reptilian side (instincts, senses, and survival patterns) and she has to uncover this new part of herself and reconcile a fate. Whether this passing mutation can be more drastic has yet to be seen.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Amy Madison was exposed to magic at an early age by her mother, who was a very powerful witch. When her parents' marriage broke up, her mother became obsessed with regaining her lost youth. When Amy went to High School, her mother decided that she was wasting her youth so she swapped bodies with her, forcing Amy into her mother's body and stealing the youthful, teenage body for herself.</p> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35500/1237260-btvs_amymadison01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1237260\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35500/1237260-btvs_amymadison01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1237260\"><img alt=\"Amy's mother, in Amy Madison's body\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35500/1237260-btvs_amymadison01.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35500/1237260-btvs_amymadison01.jpg 400w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35500/1237260-btvs_amymadison01.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Amy's mother, in Amy Madison's body</figcaption></figure> <p> </p> <p>Posing as a teenager, Amy's mother wanted to regain the title she had when she was in high school: head cheerleader, so she tried out of the squad at the same time as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20096\" href=\"/buffy/4005-20096/\" slug=\"buffy\">Buffy Summers</a>. The two of them made the reserve team together, with Buffy ranked higher than Amy. But her sights were set on being on the squad so she started taking out team-members using spells until only Buffy was between her and the place she craved.</p> <p>In her bid to be on the cheerleading team, Amy's mother cursed Buffy with a terminal disease that attacked her nervous system. Buffy quickly deteriorated, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20097\" href=\"/giles/4005-20097/\" slug=\"giles\">Giles </a>was fast to spot that it was a spell rather than a naturally occurring illness. <br/> <br/>Giles managed to switch their bodies back, and cure Buffy's illness. Buffy was then well enough to deflect a spell Amy's mother was casting that trapped her in a cheerleading she had won in her cheerleading days. Amy was sent to live with her father which she enjoyed. <br/> <br/>Amy was then later on, when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20098\" href=\"/xander/4005-20098/\" slug=\"xander\">Xander </a>saw her hypnotizing a teacher into thinking she was handing in her homework. Xander who had just broken up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20093\" href=\"/cordelia/4005-20093/\" slug=\"cordelia\">Cordelia</a>, realized she was a witch, she had inherited her powers from her mother. He wanted her to cast a spell, making Cordelia fall in love with him again. The spell went wrong and every woman in Sunnydale fell in love with Xander. Except Cordelia. Amy was also affected by the spell. She turned Buffy into a rat when the two got into a fight over Xander. Giles managed to get her to reverse the spell and everything went back to normal.  <br/> <br/>She was then seen a year later, when two children were murdered by a demon. At the time she, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20125\" href=\"/willow/4005-20125/\" slug=\"willow\">Willow </a>and a warlock named Micheal, were preparing a spell for Buffy's birthday that would make her birthday demon-free. However, a malevolent force was convincing the town that it was witches who were to blame for the deaths of the children. Amy, Willow and Buffy (who was also getting blamed), were going to be burned at the stake. Amy turned herself into a rat, it is still unknown if this was intentional or if she was trying to turn the crowd into rats. Willow kept her as a pet while she and Micheal tried unsuccessfully to turn Amy back into a human. <br/> <br/>In season four, Amy was briefly turned into a human by Willow, who didn't realize she had temporarily gained the power to manipulate reality by what she said. But she turned her back into rat before anyone could notice. <br/> <br/>In season six, Willow, who had become extremely powerful, conjures an incantation that turns Amy back into a rat. Amy thinks that she is turned back just in time for Prom (which was three years ago). Willow explains everything she missed, which shocks Amy. Amy and Willow become friends again.  <br/> <br/>However, Amy's personality has changed. She takes Willow to the Bronze and the two use their magic to cast spells for fun. When they return Willow has drained all her magic, but Amy takes her to see a warlock, who acts as a mystic drug dealer named Rack. He gives them both a power rush. This is when Willow's addiction to magic begins to get noticed by the group.  <br/> <br/>Willow puts Dawn's life in danger when she starts driving while on a magical high and the two are attacked by a demon. This makes Willow want to give up magic. But Amy casts a spell on her that makes her manipulate everything she touches. Willow says thios only makes giving up harder harder, Amy mocks her and claims it's revenge for not managing to turn her back quick enough. Amy later goes to see Willow, and Willow tells her that she is no longer welcome in the Summers home and cuts her out of her life. <br/> <br/>It is then said that Amy saved <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43601\" href=\"/warren-mears/4005-43601/\" slug=\"warren-mears\">Warren Mears</a> after Willow flayed him and kept him alive using magic.  <br/> <br/>She is then seen in season seven with Willow's old coven when she attended UC Sunnydale. She appeared to have reformed after hitting \"rock bottom\", and apologised to Willow when Willow needed the coven's help. Willow had turned into Warren Mears, the man who had killed her girlfriend Tara, after kissing potential Slayer Kennedy. Amy later told Kennedy she cast the spell that turned Willow into Warren out of hatred. The spell is reversed when Kennedy kisses her.  <br/> <br/>It was revealed in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-18201\" href=\"/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-season-eight/4050-18201/\" slug=\"buffy-the-vampire-slayer-season-eight\">season eight </a>that Amy and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43601\" href=\"/warren-mears/4005-43601/\" slug=\"warren-mears\">Warren Mears </a>(now her boyfriend), had been living in Sunnydale after it collapsed. They were discovered by the Army, lead by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70931\" href=\"/the-general/4005-70931/\" slug=\"the-general\">The General</a>, and offered to take out Buffy. As long as Warren got acess to the weapons lab, and she got acess to all the Army's magical hardware and lots of cheese. Amy casts a spell on Buffy that can only be woken by love's true kiss, and sets and sets an army of the undead on the Slayers' headquarters. Willow confronts and after a magical battle, Amy is stomped on by a giant Dawn.  <br/> <br/>Amy then pulls Willow into a portal, at their base, where Willow is kidnapped. Buffy and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46304\" href=\"/satsu/4005-46304/\" slug=\"satsu\">Satsu </a>go to recue her. Willow channels her power into Buffy, who makes Amy see her first fear, her mother. Satsu then throws a grenade at her but Amy gets out of the way. She then teleports herself and Warren away.  <br/>  <br/>It seems that being turned into a rat, rejected by Willow and what Willow did to her boyfriend have all been factors in turning Amy from an ally into a bitter enemy. <br/> </p> <br/> <h2>   Powers</h2>Amy is a powerful witch with abilities inherited from her mother. These powers grow throughout the series. While initially more powerful than Willow, casting a spell to become a rat that Willow cannot initially reverse, Amy acknowledges in Season Seven that Willow has surpassed her. Willow comments that Amy's new found power in Season Eight (which she claims has grown since the events of Chosen. has been technologically augmented to some degree, with Amy commenting that she has grown consistently stronger stranded in the ruins of Sunnydale. In battle, Amy is able to stand up against Willow and fly by force of will.",

    "deck": "Part of the Scoobies.  Andrew now trains slayers for Buffy and Giles.",
    "description": "<p>Andrew is the younger brother of Tucker Wells, the student of Sunnydale high that summoned and trained a pack of hellhounds to attack the senior prom. Andrew lived in his brother's shadow for a time, trying to distinguish himself as the guy who sent winged monkey demons to attack the school play (Romeo and Juliet).</p><h2>The Trio</h2><p>Andrew joined Jonathan Levinson and <a href=\"/warren-mears/4005-43601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43601\"> Warren Mears</a> to form \"The Trio\". Using their individual talents of summoning demons, magic, and advanced technology the three planned to make themselves rich as \"Super Villains\". While all three knew <a href=\"/buffy/4005-20096/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20096\"> Buffy</a> from school, their first contact with her as the Trio was when they had contracted a demon to help them rob a bank that Buffy happened to be applying for a loan at. While the three believed themselves to be Buffy's arch-nemeses, they had trouble causing more than an irritation in her life. The group accidentally turned Buffy invisible for a time, summoned a demon with toxic psychoactive quills that made her believe her life was a dream, and took turns seeing whose special skills could cause the largest disturbance in Buffy's life.</p><p>The groups ambitions rapidly turned from an annoyance to a serious threat after the death of Warren's ex-girlfriend. They attempted to pin the crime on Buffy, but she caught on when she learned it was Warren's ex. Warren's quest to destroy Buffy took the group toward its demise. During an armored car heist gone wrong, Warren had managed to escape with a jetpack, but when Andrew turned on his jetpack he flew into an awning, knocking himself unconscious. Andrew was arrested along with Jonathan. Warren returned to Buffy's house afterward with a handgun, managing to hospitalize Buffy and kill <a href=\"/willow/4005-20125/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20125\"> Willow</a>'s girlfriend <a href=\"/tara/4005-20101/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20101\"> Tara</a>. This sent Willow into a rage where she could no longer control herself or her magic. Willow caught Warren first and ripped the skin from his body.</p><p>With Warren believed dead, Andrew and Jonathan were sprung from jail by Buffy, <a href=\"/xander/4005-20098/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20098\"> Xander</a>, and <a href=\"/anya/4005-20100/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20100\"> Anya</a> in order to keep them alive and away from Dark Willow. After seeing her power in person, Andrew commented that she was like <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\"> Phoenix Force</a>. Willow caught up with the group at the Magic Box where Anya was able to keep her from killing Andrew and Jonathan with a counter spell. The way he recounts the incident is quite different, and involves him simply waving off her magics and protecting Jonathan. While Buffy and Anya attempted to keep Willow busy, Andrew and Jonathan were able to escape with Xander and <a href=\"/dawn/4005-42341/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42341\"> Dawn</a>, and were later able to escape from Xander, leaving the group to try to disarm Willow and prevent her from destroying the world.</p><h2>The First</h2><p>After slipping away from Xander and Buffy, Andrew and Jonathan took a van to Mexico as fugitives. There Andrew began seeing visions of his slain friend Warren. These visions were actually manifestations of the original evil of the world known as \"The First\". Believing Warren's spirit sought to make the three of them gods (which Andrew thought meant they would stroll through golden fields in white robes), Andrew located a dagger of the first's choosing and convinced Jonathan to travel back to Sunnydale with him to acquire great power. Following The First's instructions, Andrew and Jonathan unearthed an ancient seal under the new Sunnydale High and Andrew used the blade to kill Jonathan. Jonathan's blood, however, was not enough to open the seal. The First (still taking Warren's form) instructed Andrew to go get more blood in order to open the seal, and insisted that Jonathan was with him in a better place.</p><p>Warren went to the local butcher shop to get enough blood to open the seal, but was discovered by Xander and Anya who were getting blood to sustain <a href=\"/spike/4005-20126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20126\"> Spike</a>. Xander brought Andrew back to Buffy's home, where the group tied him to a chair, and Xander and Anya attempted to use a routine of \"good cop, bad cop\" in order to get Andrew to tell them what he knew. They were finally able to get Andrew to start talking when The First triggered a memory trigger in Spike, who burst through the wall and bit Andrew. Buffy was able to restrain Spike, and they were able to save Andrew (who they kept tied to a chair in the living room).</p><p>Andrew was touched that they saved him, and began telling stories and babbling about turning away from the Dark Side and becoming good. From the chair, Andrew continued to irritate Buffy and the gang. Andrew even (reluctantly) agreed to assist Buffy in stopping the madness in the high school caused by the Seal that Andrew helped to activate. The Seal, which was activated by blood that Andrew spilled, could only be deactivated by Andrew's tears. To get Andrew's tears Buffy made Andrew face what he did to his best friend, Jonathan, and told him that she had to kill him over the seal to stop it.</p><p>After stopping the seal, Andrew continued to stay at Buffy's house, irritating all of its many inhabitants. When The First came back to Andrew as Jonathan, Andrew even attempted to help the Scoobies by wearing a wire and attempting (quite poorly) to elicit more information about the nature of The First.</p><p>During the battle of Sunnydale, Andrew came along to help the gang. He fought alongside Anya against the Ubervamps, and Anya died protecting him. Andrew made it out of the school relatively unharmed, and got out of Sunnydale with the Scoobies and the Slayers before the town imploded.</p><p>Since the destruction of Sunnydale, Andrew has remained with the Scoobies. At first, Andrew was trained to be a Watcher by Giles and was sent to Los Angeles to supervise Angel's capture of Slayer Dana. Later, Andrew was put in charge of his own regiment of Slayers in Italy, and became one of Buffy's closer friends and most valuable Watchers and recruitment agents. He accompanies the core group on a mission to Tokyo, and later teams up with Buffy to hunt down rogue Slayer Simone Doffler.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>While initially useless, Andrew is technically a genius, part of the inclusion criteria for supervillain group The Trio. His specialty, like that of his brother, was demon summoning. Later, he developed Watcher skills under the tutelage of Rupert Giles: these require familiarities with the occult, Slayer history, and some degree of fighting skills. Recently, Andrew's genius and demon-summoning expertise were shown when he managed to genetically recreate a long-extinct breed of demon through recombinant DNA experiments.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Andrew Devon is a former professor of modern and medieval languages from Cambridge. While growing up in St. Louis, Missouri, his interest in the supernatural was piqued when he read Kate Corrigan's study of a demonic possession in Azerbaijan.</p><p>First appearing in The Universal Machine, he was called upon by Dr. Corrigan to help broker a deal for a rare text that may have held the secret to restoring Roger to life. Sometime following the incident, he was employed as a B.P.R.D. field agent and eventually rose to become a senior member of the staff. Following the events of King of Fear he became distrustful of fellow agent Abraham Sapien, believing him to have a hand in the global apocalypse. This distrust would later lead him to cover up Abe's near fatal shooting at the hands of Fenix in New Mexico. He would later catch up to Fenix and her group in The Devil's Engine and escort her on the dangerous journey to B.P.R.D headquarters in Colorado.</p><p>Despite coming from an academic background and his relative inexperience as a field agent, Devon has displayed the capacity for quick thinking and decisive action during stressful situations. His misgivings concerning Abe's loyalty have caused friction between him and Kate and he has at times expressed dissatisfaction with the Bureau's handling of the worldwide crisis. Doesn't like phone booths.</p>",

One day he got in trouble with S.W Manor and wanted help from John but refused to aid him. So Lucky puts a gun in John's hand to shoot him but his friend gives it back to him and commits suicide in front of him inside a bar's toilet. John was blamed for his murder and sent in prison. While in isolation Lucky appears as a ghostly apparition. He appears later too giving advice to his living friend when he was searching for his wife. </p>",

    "description": "<p>A priest with a taste for sacrilege and who dabbles in the dark arts, \"Rick the Vic\" was a close friend of John Constantine.<br/><br/>John's friends don't usually live long though and this was no different for Rick, who kills himself when The First of the Fallen, on a crusade to revenge himself upon John Constantine by taking out his friends, closes in upon him.  Rick's suicide was an attempt at escaping, but, as he should have known, suicide is a mortal sin, so he finds himself in Hell with no option but to betray another of John's friends to The First of the Fallen.<br/><br/>Rick was one of multiple characters in Hellblazer created by then-writer Garth Ennis who were all offed in Ennis' final arc on the title, as Ennis seemingly doesn't like other people playing with his toys.  Whereas many characters in the Hellblazer comic book who die may pop up again in a flashback at one time or another, this isn't the case so much for Ennis' cast except for during the 5 issue \"Son of Man\" story Ennis returned to write some years later.  The one exception to this is that Rick along with some other Ennis creations/casualties appear in non-speaking capacity as members of John's recurring gang of ghosts.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Gary Lester was a childhood friend of <a href=\"/john-constantine/4005-3329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3329\">John Constantine</a> and the two would later go on to form the Punk band <a href=\"/mucous-membrane/4060-58026/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58026\">Mucous Membrane</a> with him on guitar and songwriter. Gary would also follow John into the world of the occult  and traveled with him to Newcastle on one fateful night. After the tragedy of Newcastle, Gary turned to drugs and eventually became addicted to heroin. </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Gary Lester was created by <a href=\"/jamie-delano/4040-40642/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40642\">Jamie Delano</a> and first drawn by artist <a href=\"/john-ridgway/4040-4489/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4489\">John Ridgway</a> in <em>Hellblazer</em> #1 (Jan 1988).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>On one of his travels to Africa looking for drugs, Gary came across a possessed boy in a sweatshop with binding markings. Using his knowledge of exorcisms and a desire to atone for Newcastle, he freed the spirit and captured it in a magic flask, which would turn out to be the demon <a href=\"/mnemoth/4005-52801/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52801\">Mnemoth</a>, the hunger spirit.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, the demon escaped and began possessing people. He tracked down John Constantine who in turn visited <a href=\"/papa-midnite/4005-52716/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52716\">Papa Midnite</a> where they came up with a plan to lure the demon back to Lester and then bind him with the same markings as the African boy had. The plan worked and Gary died with the hunger entity sealed away inside him, buried in the basement of Papa Midnite's New York club.</p><p>As a spirit Gary would both haunt and advise John in his later years.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><strong><em>Constantine</em></strong></p><p>Irish actor Jonjo O'Neill portrays Gary Lester in episode 4 of the NBC series <em>Constantine </em>\"A Feast of Friends\" based on the first two issues of <em>Hellblazer</em>. He is an old friend of Constantine who is also a drug addict. He participated in the Newcastle incident, which sent Astra's soul to Hell.</p><p>Much like the comic, Gary seeks out John after trapping the hunger demon in a bottle while in Africa. John is dismissive of Gary and thinks of him as a waste of space but agrees to help clear up his mess. The two reminisce about Newcastle and John forgives him for being scared, all the while planning to trap the demon in Gary himself. Accepting his fate, Gary agrees to be possessed and be marked with the seal. John holds his hand while the angel Manny accepts him into heaven as he dies.</p>",

    "deck": "Technically a zombie, Albert is a friend of John Constantine (Hellblazer) and constant companion of Clarice Sackville.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin<br/></h2> <p>Little is known about Albert's past, he was court magician to the infamous Kray twins that ran much of London's criminal underworld in the 1960s. He pulls 'an old fakir trick' suggesting that he has studied under magicians in India, or at least has a broad view of such things. At some point he became a companion of Clarice Sackville, whom he is rarely seen without. The pair are members of The Tate Club.</p><h2>Story Arcs<br/></h2><h3> Ghosts</h3> <br/> <p> Constantine first met Albert while he was investigating the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Isabel Bracknell. John hoped that avenging her death would allow her ghost to release its hold on the world and enter the afterlife. Clarice and other mages helped John get revenge on the killer, but Isabel's ghost would not move on. To help her, John enlisted Albert's help; Albert then projected his spirit, took the girl's hand and led her into the afterlife.</p> <p> While this implied that Albert may have been a ghost himself, his subsequent appearances made it quite clear that he had a physical form. He next turned up in the Red Sepulchre arc, as John Constantine found himself stuck between a vicious gangster named  Domine Fredericks and the combined forces of  The Tate Club - with Albert counseling Clarice not to trust John. After Fredericks' men attacked the Tate, Albert was able to get himself and Clarice to safety and together they raised a demon to attack Fredericks' place. After Fredericks was disposed with - thanks to some clever work on John's part - Albert told him that Fredericks had been having dreams about a monster known as  The Shadow Dog. </p> <h3> Death</h3> <p> Years later, John contacted Clarice and Albert again to ask for help with his three demonic children , Adam, Saul and Maria. As the three left The Tate Club Adam cast a spell that caused a tornado of broken glass to whirl through the street, shredding everyone in it. Albert managed to push Clarice inside the Tate, saving her life, but was ripped to shreds immediately afterwards. </p>",
