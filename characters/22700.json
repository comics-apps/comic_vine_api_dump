His zanpakuto is called Senbonzakura and he is the most famous of the 13 captains. He is also the 28th head of the Kuchiki clan which is the most noble of all of soul society. His lieutenant in the sixth division is Renji Abarai. He is the grandson of Ginrei Kuchiki, the former captain of the sixth division.",
    "description": "<h2><span style=\"font-family:jubilat, 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:24px;line-height:30px;\">General Information</span></h2><ul><li>Birthday: January 31</li><li>Height: 5'11\"</li><li>Weight: 141lbs</li><li>Eyes: Gray</li><li>Hair: Black</li><li>Race: Shinigami</li></ul><h2>General Appearance</h2><p>Byakuya Kuchiki is a captain in the Gotei 13 and the son of the noble Kuchiki family. Being as such he wears the traditional Captains dress uniform and jacket as well as a scarf that has been handed down throughout his family as the Son assumes the head of the Kuchiki family. Aside from his uniform Byakuya wears the head dress pieces, called kenseikan, that symbolize his being ranked as nobility. The Kenseinkan look like short metal tubes that are holding his hair in place and serve no real function in battle. Byakuya has black hair and an icy gaze that he often uses to intimidate those who have lesser will power than he does. Also Byakuya wears hand guards on the backs of his hands, something few of the other captains of the Gotei 13 do.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Byakuya often behaves coldly towards others, especially if that person has offended or provoked him. Being born of a noble family has not helped Byakuya to develop into a very friendly person. Byakuya takes everything serious and often finishes everything he can as quickly and effectively as he possibly can. Besides that Byakuya is a very honorable man who does everything in his power to keep his word once he makes a promise. Byakuya is a very confident person and has good reason to be so.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Byakuya was born into the Kuchiki family, one of the four noble families. Byakuya grew up in the Kuchiki mansion in the Seireitei of <a href=\"/soul-society/4020-46356/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-46356\"> Soul Society</a>. He would spend many hours training, so he could take over the leadership of the Kuchiki family and the 6th Division from his grandfather, Ginrei. </p><p><a href=\"/yoruichi-shihouin/4005-47126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47126\"> Yoruichi</a> seemed to be on good terms with the members of the Kuchiki noble family, so she would often visit the Kuchiki manor to play tag with Byakuya. On one visit, about 110 years ago, she is presented to train Byakuya by his grandfather Ginrei Kuchiki, the head of the Kuchiki family and the 6th Division captain. Upon seeing the arrival of Yoruichi, he swung his sword at her and called her a demon cat. Yoruichi laughed and playfully began to tease him, calling him \"Little Byakuya,\" complaining about why she received such a greeting after she came all the way there to see him. Byakuya yelled at her that he would never want to see the likes of her and that he will be the head of the Kuchiki clan soon enough so he has no time to waste on her. This prompted Yoruichi to steal the ribbon holding his hair back, Byakuya reacted by quickly turning and swinging his sword at her, but she used Shunpo to move to the roof of a nearby building. Yoruichi laughed at him and exclaimed that if the head of clan Kuchiki could get his hair tie stolen by a girl at play, then she would worry about the future of the clan. Not to be defeated so easily, Byakuya told her not to move an inch, but before he could finish speaking, she told him that he couldn't catch her just as she used Shunpo again to begin the chase. Byakuya plainly stated that he could see that she wanted him to get mad, and he promised to make her see the error of her ways, even claiming that his flash steps are far superior to the likes of hers.</p><p>Fifty-five years ago, Byakuya married Hisana, who was a commoner from Rukongai and the sister of Rukia; therefore, he broke the rules by accepting her into the noble Kuchiki family. Five years later, she became sick and was near death. Shortly before her death, Hisana asked Byakuya to find and adopt her biological sister, whom she had abandoned as a baby. She also made him promise that he would not tell <a href=\"/rukia-kuchiki/4005-46355/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46355\"> Rukia</a> about her real family, for she believed that by abandoning Rukia when she was younger, she was not worthy to be called her sister.</p><p>One year later, Byakuya found Rukia at the Academy and immediately adopted her into the Kuchiki clan. By adopting her, Byakuya respected his late wife's final wish, but had broken the rules of his clan again. He later swore upon his parents' graves that he would never break the rules again, no matter what. As a result, he, though entirely apathetic on the surface, is actually deeply conflicted with the matter of Rukia's execution; should he intervene, it would require breaking the promise to his parents and the rules again, but should he do nothing, he would fail to fulfill the last promise he made to his dying wife to protect Rukia as his own sister.</p><p>Less than 49 years ago and not long before Rukia joined the Gotei 13, Byakuya became the captain of the 6th Division.</p><h3>Battle of the Rubicon/ The Death Trilogy Overture</h3><p>After <a href=\"/ichigo/4005-42468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\"> Ichigo Kurosaki</a> and <a href=\"/\"> Uryu</a><a href=\"/uryu-ishida/4005-42857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42857\"> Ishida</a> have finished their battle race by joining each other to defeat a greater threat, the Menos Grande, the Gotei 13 get info that a human has Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo's abilities are then linked to the disappearance of the Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki. Byakuya and his lieutenant <a href=\"/renji-abarai/4005-43022/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43022\"> Renji Abara</a>i are sent out to retrieve Rukia and if necessary kill the human who is using her powers. The two first run into Rukia not paying attention and are ready to apprehend her when they are interrupted by Uryu Ishida. Byakuya simply allows Renji to fight and watches while Renji defeats Uryu.Again Renji and Byakuya go to arrest and capture Rukia, but this time Ichigo shows up and tries to save Rukia. Renji begins to fight Ichigo and starts off doing well. After wounding Ichigo ,though, Renji finds out Ichigo's powers are increasing as he is wounded. Byakuya finally steps in to keep Ichigo from killing Renji as they fight. Byakuya breaks Ichigo's Zanpakuto and stabs him through his Soul Power and Soul Sleep cores. After the short and unseen battle where Byakuya wins in two strikes, Renji and Rukia join him in returning to the Soul Society.</p><h3>Soul Society Storyline</h3><p>Once Byakuya and Renji return to the Soul Society with Rukia as their prisoner Byakuya is given orders that Rukia will be executed for her crimes against the Soul Society. When Byakuya leaves the prison after passing the sentence on to Rukia he is greeted by the taunts of Kenpachi, another Capatin in the Gotei 13. Byakuya is challenged by Kenpachi to a fight, but Gin Ichimaru, again an other Captain, steps in to stop <a href=\"/kenpachi/4005-42566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42566\"> Kenpachi</a> from getting into the fight. Byakuya isn't seen very often after that until he tries to stop Ganju Shiba and Hanataro Yamada's attempt to free Rukia from the tower she is held in. Byakuya uses his Zanpakuto's released form on Ganju, nearly killing Ganju. Ichigo shows up at the last second and attempts to save Rukia by fighting Byakuya. Byakuya is ready to cut down Ichigo when Yoruichi Shihouin arrives and knocks Ichigo unconscious so that she can escape from Byakuya with Ichigo still alive. Byakuya tries to stop and capture Yoruichi using Flash Steps to track her and if he could catch her. Yoruichi proves to be too quick and escapes with Ichigo. Byakuya continues to enforce the laws of the Soul Society during the ensuing chaos of the invasion. During this time Byakuya has to face off against his own lieutenant, Renji Abarai.</p><p>Renji approaches Byakuya and reveals that he too can now perform Bankai and releases Zabimaru on Baykuya. Byakuya tries to fight without using his release form or his bankai but ends up using Senbonzakura, Byakuya's Zanpakuto's released form's name, to bring Renji to his knees. Before leaving Renji Byakuya decides out of respect for how much Renji has improved by learning his Bankai Byakuya uses his own Bankai, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi, to finish their duel.</p><p>After his battle with Renji Byakuya joins the remaining Captains and their Lieutenants that are waiting for the execution at the site for which is to host Rukia's demise. As the execution is about to begin two of the senior captains stand in the way and almost stop the execution before Ichigo finally shows up and puts an end to the ceremony. Once Byakuya and Ichigo have the execution grounds to themselves they begin their battle. Byakuya looks like he is the early favorite in the fight catching and injurying Ichigo with his Senbonzakura. Byakuya is surprised, though, when Ichigo unleashes his Bankai and forces Byakuya to press him with his release form and eventually use his own Bankai to wear down Ichigo. Again Byakuya looks like he has the fight going his way, but his chances are cut down when Ichigo's Inner Hollow unveils itself to level the playing field. After Ichigo overcomes his Inner Hollow Byakuya and Ichigo decide to settle the battle with the last of their powers in one attack. Byakuya is left defeated.</p><p>After the battle for Rukia's life is thought over it is finally revealed to all the characters that Captain Aizen is actually been pulling the strings behind Rukia's execution so that he could get a hold of the Orb of Distortion. After Renji and Ichigo are thwarted in their efforts to save Rukia Aizen removes the Orb and tells Gin Ichimaru to kill Rukia. As Gin begins his attack Rukia is saved by her adoptive brother Byakuya.</p><p>Aizen and his followers, Tozen and Gin, leave the Soul Society for Hueco Mundo, Byakuya and his new comrades begin the healing process. It is here that Byakuya reveals that he was so supportive of killing Rukia because of an oath he had made to his parents when they had died. Byakuya promised them that he would never break a law. Byakuya reveals that he has had several secrets that he has been keeping when he also reveals to Rukia that she is in all actuality his sister- in- law. Byakuya reveals that he had a wife Hisana whom he had once been happily married to. While Hisana was alive she revealed to Byakuya that she had once had a little baby sister that she couldn't take care of so she had to hide her and let her raise herself. Hisana was lucky that Byakuya had fallen in love with and brought her into his family, saving her from the starvation and murder that most of the districts of the Soul Society were plagued with. As Hisana was dying she revealed her tragic secret to Byakuya and asked him to adopt Rukia and never tell her the truth. Byakuya decided that as he had fought so hard to kill Rukia that she deserved to know about his promises. Byakuya asks for forgiveness and Rukia gives him her pardon.</p><h3>Arrancar Storyline</h3><p>In the Arrnacar storyline Byakuya is only seen when he and Captain Kenpachi Zaraki are sent to the human realm to retrieve all the Soul Reapers that are fighting and return them to the Soul Society. Byakuya does overlook the fact that Renji and Rukia leave to follow Ichigo into Hueco Mundo.</p><h2>Zanpakuto</h2><h3>Name and appearance</h3><p>Byakuya's Zanpkauto is named Senbonzakura. It resembles a regular katana with a simple cross guard. The cross guard is a simple open frame and resembles a four pane window. The hilt of the sword and it's sheathe are both white.</p><p><u><b>Shikai</b></u></p><p>In it's initial release Senonzakura breaks itself into a cloud of blades that resemble cherry blossoms. When in it's initial release Senbonzakura moves by Byakuya's thoughts alone, however if an enemy is proving very fast and bothersome Byakuya can use his hands to more easily guide Senbonzakura. When using his hands as guides for the blades Byakuya's attack accuracy and speed almost double.</p><p><u><b>Bankai</b></u></p><p>When Byakuya uses his Bankai, Senbonzakura evolves again, this time becoming Senbonzakura Kageyoshi. In this release the Zanpakuto can attack from either of two forms. The first form is several swords that Byakuya can grab and use to attack with. He can also use all the sword to attack at once. In the second form Byakuya's spirit powers condense themselves into one sword and give Byakuya angel-like wings and a halo. The second form allows Byakuya to put all the power of his Senbonzakura Kageyoshi into it's cutting and speed, giving him his strongest attack.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As a captain of the Soul Society and a member of the noble blood of the Soul Society, Byakuya possesses a large amount of powers and skills.</p><p>These include:</p><ul><li><b>Master Swordsmanship.</b></li><li><b><i>Shunpo</i> or Flash Steps Master</b>: Byakuya is one of the most proficient users of <i>shunpo</i> in all of Soul Society.

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Pyron was born over 65 million years ago on the planet Hellstorm. This planet was governed by violence and wars and centered on the main principle of evolution. Each new generation of beings were evolved beyond their ancestors. However only one being was able to achieve the peak of evolution: his name was Pyron.</p><p>Over the eons he has traveled the universe, to other stars and galaxies, in search of planets to drain. One world that gained his attention was Earth. Pyron used his precognition to predict how the planet would turn out in the future and that it would eventually develop powerful fighters. In anticipation Pyron created his own loyal robot followers, the Huitzil. These machines were to monitor Earth's development and notify their creator when it had been populated with beings who could provide Pyron with the one thing he unusually craved for: physical combat. This would lead to the Huitzil extinguishing the Dinosaurs, before going deep underground and entering a long sleep until humanity appeared.</p><p>Pyron returned in the present day, leading to the events of <a href=\"/darkstalkers-official-complete-works/4050-73453/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-73453\">Darkstalkers</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Pyron is a cosmic entity whose psychic form occupies over 400.000 light years of space. His physical body seems to be entirely composed of energy allowing him to change his own shape and size and making it almost impossible to harm him. He can change into any shape he desires and split his body into several parts to use as avatars of himself. His body naturally produces an enormous amount of heat and when he aproached the Earth he caused a drastic change in the planet's temperature.</p><p>His most displayed power is the ability to manipulate energy on a cosmic scale for a variety of effects. He has been seen absorbing the energies of the planets he collected to add to himself and in battle one of his main forms of attack consists of shooting energy blasts (usually in the form of spheres) at his opponents. He also usually protects himself by creating an energy barrier around his body.</p><p>He can manipulate matter using his cosmic powers and did so to create the Huitzils- an army of super advanced robots- to serve him.</p><p>He can also teleport and does so in battle to surprise his opponents and dodge attacks.</p><p>Finally, he also seems to possess cosmic awareness as he was able to predict millions of years ago that the Earth would eventually generate beings powerful enough to saciate his hunger for combat.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Huitzil's race were created when Pyron first visited Earth millions of years ago. After wiping out the dinosaurs, they traveled underground. There they slept for millions of years. Around 520 AD however, they were discovered by the Mayans, who used them for themsleves, and for a multitude of purposes.</p><p>Eventually, they were placed into the Teotihuacan Ruins, and went into another long sleep. When Pyron later returned to Earth, they reawoke, to complete their orders once more. However, due to a unforseen malfunction, Huitzil carried out new orders: To protect a young boy named Cecil, who had stumbled upon it by accident one day. When the unit who had befreinded Cecil was destroyed protecting him from Jedah it activated the other units to protect the boy.</p><p>Huitzil's entire body is in fact, one giant weapon. In addition to the standard physical attacks and icy eye beams, Huitzil is able to edit his body through unknown means to create weapons to use. He's been shown turning his arms  and legs into buzzsaws, drills and massive claws, as well as extend blades from his kneecaps. He's capable of turning his arms into massive gatling guns, or pull them into his shoulders and then proceed to fire rockets out of them. However, nothing is failproof, and should Huitzil try to activate the wrong weapon, a chunk of ice will simply fall out of his shoulder, and he'll try to rip his head off in a bout of confusion. He's also capable of achieving flight in two different ways. The first by retracting his arms into his shoulders once more, and using them as a sort of impromptu jetpack. The other involves him turning his legs into a black upsidedown pyramid with purple orbs floating about it. He then proveeds to levitate about the air.<br/></p>",

Hood became a Darkhunter when a plethora of supernatural creatures from Makai began to make an exodus to the world of the humans. These creatures become a scientific curiosity, and hunters were employed to capture these creatures for the purpose of furthering research in bio-weaponry. Hunting these creatures is an extremely dangerous profession, and failure means certain death. Having a sound body and mind are not enough to succeed as a Darkhunter. It requires a particularly dark heart to avoid the poisonous aura emanated by these creatures. B.B. Hood is ranked a \"Special S-Class Hunter\", her stare alone is enough to cause many stronger Darkstalkers to cower in fear. In fact, B.B. is believed to be an ideal candidate for a hunter. B.B.'s cruel heart was dark enough that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44108\" href=\"/jedah/4005-44108/\" slug=\"jedah\">           Jedah</a> considered to be an actual Darkstalker, and he teleported her to the realm of Majigen.

    "deck": "The succubus Morrigan was deemed too powerful by her father Belial, and her power was split in three. One part she got to keep, the second Belial kept, and the third was sealed away, eventually becoming Lilith.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2> <p>Lilith is souless being. Part of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43744\" href=\"/morrigan/4005-43744/\" slug=\"morrigan\">  Morrigan</a>, she was found by Jedah who promised her body when she finished completing the task of gathering Darkstalkers. Lilith, like Morrigan, searches for new sensation. She loves the sight (and taste) of blood and sees fighting asjust merely playing around. Lilith also takes her responsibilty seriously looking for Morrigan so they can reunite and rule the Maki as one entity she's accomplished this when she combined with Morrigan afterwards she felt a new sensation in herself. In another reality Lilith seemingly failed her quest and disappearing only inches away from Morrigan, though Morrigan felt a strong connection with the isis ring a family Heirloom this may mean that Lilth didn't completely fail her quest.</p> <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Lilith though being a succubus isn't prone to feeding off her male enemies like her Busty counterpart. Lilith like Morrigan can switch between her clothes with a mere flip. She also has bats that tend to her every will may it be a bed, a projectile, or a giant palette of green energy. She's also able to form another illusion of herself. Also the abilty to hold a puppet show starring her opponents.",

    "description": "<p>Though he is over 6000 years old, Jedah is the youngest out of the three High Nobles of Makai. </p><p>Jedah was always distressed about the future of Makai (Japanese  for \"demon world\"). He believed that if Makai was left under Belial's  rule, the master of the Aensland family and the true ruler of Makai,  then it would grow old and begin to decay. Belial would most likely say  that such is destiny and life. Jedah considered Belial to be an  abomination, and actively sought out the opportunity to kill him,  waiting for the right time to strike. </p> After the death of Garunan, the master of the Bosital family and the  oldest of the three high nobles, Jedah had a young confidant named  Ozomu. Simply put, he was a gourmet. The reason he came under Jedah was  to be able to eat delicious souls. As a noble, his skills were second  class, but his ability to deceive others were first class. He was a  genius in using others. He advised Jedah about using the gate of Makai.  Jedah, being confident in his ability to absorb souls, agreed to this.  He ordered Ozomu to break a part of the seal to open the gate more.    <div><h3> Ending from Darkstalkers 3</h3> <br/> </div><br/><br/>The Savior of The Demon World succeeded in  traveling back in time to find The Fetus of <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59221/1848878-jedah6.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1848878\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59221/1848878-jedah6.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1848878\"><img alt=\"Jedah &amp; The Fetus Of God \" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59221/1848878-jedah6.gif\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59221/1848878-jedah6.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Jedah &amp; The Fetus Of God </figcaption></figure> God, and baptising it with his own blood so the world would be subject to rule under a demon God.",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Widdle Wade Story</h2><b>Widdle Wade</b> was created in a lab by the Boss' scientists from samples of Deadpool's blood to be his ultimate hit man. The Boss at the time having a vendetta against a seemingly unbeatable sumo known as the Oyakata, honed his little assassin for the day he'd finally be given the task of killing the Oyakata.<p>However, years had gone past and the Boss had let go of his vendetta, but Widdle Wade refused to abandon his very purpose. We went to kill the Oyakata, but was stopped by Deadpool, whom Boss hired to protect the Oyakata.</p><p>Proving to be as skilled and nimble as the original, but smaller and harder to hit, Deadpool won by having Widdle Wade hit by a truck which carried him off.</p><p>Widdle Wade snuck into the Oyakata's compound, killed some of his men, and had his dog Daruma go after Oyakata's daughter, Sazae. Widdle Wade was about to kill the Oyakata when Deadpool showed up with Daruma's collar. Infuriated, Widdle Wade chased after Deadpool into a sumo ring where the two fought until Deadpool stabbed Widdle Wade.</p><p>As he laid dying, Widdle Wade forgave Deadpool, explaining that he was made to be Deadpool and was forced to share all of Deadpool's demons, but was never Deadpool. He then asked if he had killed as many people as Deadpool has, if he would feel better about himself.</p><p>When Deadpool took off Widdle Wade's mask at his request, Deadpool saw that Widdle Wade wasn't scarred. </p><p>Deadpool buried Widdle Wade in a playground.</p>",

Before Jack was flung into the future, he was trained by the best warriors of his time. An archer (Robin Hood) who taught him how to use a bow, and how to sneak into enemy territory. An African chief who taught him multiple martial arts like the Cheetah, Antelope, Monkey, Snake, and Scorpion. Greek Olympians who taught him how to wrestle. Buddhist monks taught him to fight hand to hand and with different weapons, and Vikings taught him to sail. He was also trained by Egyptians to read hieroglyphs and other academic things and, at the very beginning of his training, a man told Jack about the constellations and directions. He was also trained how to track by a kindly desert tracker.</p><p>All trainers were friends of Jack's father, the Japanese Emperor. Jack's father trusted the trainers to train Jack in the event <a href=\"/aku/4005-44136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44136\">Aku</a> would return and try to take over the world. When Jack was in his early 20's, he confronted Aku with his father's blade. Wanting revenge, Jack was beaten then thrown into Aku's prison with his father and mother. When Jack's father found out that he was going to get revenge on Aku instead of striking Aku down with honor, Jack's father taught him a lesson in humility. After Jack learned his lesson, he went back and confronted Aku a second time. The battle went bad for Aku, but before Jack struck the final blow, Aku tore open a portal in time, where his evil was law. Now Jack seeks to return to the past and undo the future that is Aku.</p><p>In the future Jack isn't used to the native technology. Since he was born in the time with medieval weapons and the beginning days of martial arts, it was really different for him. Jack has to constantly look for a way to get back to his native time, and he has to protect the innocent and the helpless along the way. The more Jack stays, the more he gets used to the future and it's culture. However, Jack never stops looking for a way home, knowing that Aku is still enslaving the people of his country. Jack has met new and unique people in his time in the future. Jack's friends have lent a helping hand to repay him for the kindness that he showed them.</p><p>Time after time, Jack is constantly being hunted by Aku's soldiers. However, every time this happens Jack always emerges victor. In some occasions, Aku will appear, showing off how powerful he thinks he is. Jack will not waste much moments talking to Aku, and will attack him immediately. Since the magic sword is the only weapon that can kill Aku, before the final blow is struck, Aku shapeshifts and escape saying, \"bye, bye Samurai.\" Then they don't see each other for about a week. This process is constantly repeated over and over again.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Jack is in many ways a very righteous person with an undying zeal to do good whenever and wherever he can, and help the innocent who may be under attack or may just need help for problems they can't solve on their own. He is kind and generous to anyone in need that he finds along his way, and will never refuse them aid. This is so much even to the point where he sacrifices a chance to go back to his own time just to help others, like he did with the Shaolin Monks. His distaste for evil and injustice is as strong as his love for justice and righteousness.</p><p>He is also very clever and is an exceptional strategist, coming up with plans to fit certain situations, and also knowing when he is outmatched in either numbers or in strength and cannot win with brute force alone.</p><p>He is also a very serious man when it counts, always keeping in mind the stakes of the situation at hand and the mission he must complete.</p><p>After spending fifty years trying to return home, the years of fighting and failing to achieve his goal have eroded Jack's compassion, drive, and sense of purpose. Having given up on returning home, Jack has also lost his taste for helping others,. As such, he helps people less often. These effects are compounded by the loss of his trusted sword. Jack also suffers from vivid hallucinations.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Samurai Jack was created by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/genndy-tartakovsky/4040-57171/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-57171\">Genndy Tartakovsky</a> for Cartoon Network's animated television series of the same name and as a follow-up to his successful series <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dexters-laboratory/4075-95/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-95\">Dexter's Laboratory</a>. Cartoon Network started broadcasting the show in August 2001; see below for more information.</p><h2>Media</h2><p>Cartoon Network produced 4 seasons with 52 episodes of Samurai Jack; each season consisted of 13 episodes. The show premiered on August 10th, 2001 and ended on October 29th, 2004. There has also been talks of a Samurai Jack movie that would be produced by J.J. Abrams (<a href=\"/cloverfield/4025-114/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-114\">Cloverfield</a>). There was originally plans for a film in the early 2000's depending on how well the <a href=\"/the-powerpuff-girls-movie/4025-1084/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1084\">Powerpuff Girls</a> movie would do. Unfortunately it did not do well and the Samurai Jack movie was dropped.</p><p>In late 2015, It was teased that a fifth season would be made as a way to wrap up the series and hopefully conclude Jack's mission. The season started airing in March 2017 and will only last ten episodes.</p><h3>Season 1:</h3><p>August 10 - November 2, 2001</p><ol><li><strong>The Beginning</strong>: Aku enslaves the people in Jack's land.

He was trained by the greatest warriors throughout the world, like a Shaolin Monk, Egyptian Pharaoh, Robin Hood, and other (pseudo) Historic figures. While in the future, Jack continued to pick up new skills to aid him in his fights. Through his training, he gained the following abilities:</p><p><b>Master Combatant</b>: Jack has shown impressive mastery in many styles of hand to hand combat, some of which include: Praying Mantis, Tiger, and Eagle, as well as a number of weapons that range from spears and staffs to nunchaku and shuriken, as shown in his fights at the Dome of Doom. He is also proficient in five forms of African stick fighting, namely the Cheetah, Monkey, Snake, Scorpion, and Antelope. After losing his sword, Jack spent a considerable amount of time gathering new weapons to compensate for the loss. In addition to the bladed weapons he possesses, he also takes any useful weapon from the foes he defeats.</p><p><b>Master Archer:</b> Jack has shown to have excellent skills in the bow and arrow since he was trained by Robin Hood. His Archery skills were shown in Episode 3 when Jack used his archery skills to set off traps against the beetle drones and later used his last arrows on the beetle drones which they hit dead on.</p><p><b>Master Swordsman</b>: Aside from Jack's ability to proficiently wield a vast number of weaponry, he is well known for possessing the greatest amount of skill with his sword. This was most likely due to the fact that the only weapon capable of destroying Aku was Jack's blade, allowing him to combat a number of enemies easily as shown in his battles with the beetle drones as well as the countless bounty hunters and assassins that Aku sends to capture or kill Jack. Jack is shown to rely primarily on swiftness and precision in his strikes in a balanced blend of attack and defense, able to land dozens of blows in seconds, as well as being able to parry machine gun fire. Coupled with the sword's extreme cutting power, Jack can also slice through structures, enemies and machines much larger then he is while also being able to parry most strikes with ease. He is shown to be an equal match to the Scotsman.</p><p><strong>Master Marksman: </strong>Fifty years after being brought to the future, Jack has mastered the use of the firearms available to compensate for the loss of his sword. His proficiency with guns is sophisticated enough that he can hit multiple targets while riding a motorcycle.</p><p><b>Enhanced Strength</b>: Jack is shown to have remarkable strength for his lean frame, able to cleanly cut through most machines with no effort and can easily throw opponents much larger than himself.</p><p><b>Enhanced Speed</b>: Jack is shown to be extremely swift on his feet and has performed incredible feats of speed and agility, able to avoid gunfire, carve through entire armies within seconds and in one instance, defeat a team composed entirely of highly infamous and skilled bounty hunters in the time it takes for a drop of water to hit the ground.</p><p><b>Enhanced Jumping Capability</b>: Since coming to the future, Jack has learned the ability to leap many times his own height to the point of looking as if he could fly while also being able to fall from great distances with no injury from a jungle man and his adopted tribe of white-furred gorilla's. This is due to the training method of having incredibly heavy boulders tied to his arms, legs and back and being forced to perform strenuous activities such as climbing up a tree via a vine, tight-rope running across a clearing until his body has adjusted to the weight. This has vastly increased his strength granting him new levels of speed and agility.</p><p><b>Enhanced Durability: </b>Throughout his adventures, Jack has been shown to possess a great tolerance for physical pain, having survived powerful blows from various assassins, robots, and monsters, and is still able to stand up and fight.</p><p><strong>Intelligence: </strong>Jack has demonstrated a high level of understanding and intelligence, being an expert at planning and creating strategies for confrontations, using his surroundings to his advantage, and seeing through Aku's deception on quite a few occasions.</p><p><strong>Extraordinary willpower: </strong>Jack is not at all one to give up easily, once he knows what his mission is, he will do whatever it takes to complete it, no matter what odds he faces. For instance, he has climbed the highest mountain in the world without food or water while braving the obstacles in his way, and fought against armies of drones sent by Aku to destroy him.

    "deck": "The evil shape shifter who is Samurai Jack's archnemesis. In a heated battle with Jack, just before Aku could be killed, he flung Jack into the future where he was supreme overlord.",
    "description": "<p>Aku is an evil wizard that is created to only destroy and bring chaos! He was forged from an exploding planet filled with a whole bunch of lives, he later arrived on Earth. He constantly battles his arch nemesis, <a href=\"/samurai-jack/4005-44135/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44135\">Samurai Jack</a>. Samurai Jack and Aku first appeared in \" <a href=\"/samurai-jack-special/4050-18590/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18590\">Samurai Jack Special</a> #1\". Anything made by man (or alien) can't kill Aku. Only the sword forged for this sole purpose by the gods can hurt Aku. This sword was given to Jack's father, thanks to his pureness of heart, to kill Aku.

Jack's father only wanted to kill Aku, however he didn't know that the jade arrow he fired at Aku was going to give him life. Jack's father had a sword that was forged from pureness of heart, and he eventually defeated the monster Aku. After Aku, (some how) escaped Jack's father tried to defeat Aku once again, however Jack's father was captured, and he told his wife to take his young son to be trained by the best warriors in the world. Years later, when his father and mother were old, Samurai Jack entered combat with the beast. When Aku was on his last breath, he tore open a portal in time that made Jack go over 800 years into the future. Aku hired a group of scientists to make a robot army. As time passed, the X-models were made. A X-model had an emotional chip installed in it. The model was known as X9. After the deaths of the X-models, the scientists helped Aku make beetle drones and mantoids.</p><p><b>Future</b></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1337594\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 1024px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1337594\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png 1024w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png 1024w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/1337594-picture_1.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Time after time, Aku has tried everything to kill his worst enemy, Samurai Jack. He's used bounty hunters, animal men, demons, shape shifters, and other things, however Jack's skills have always proved that he is better than any threat. Jack has also tried to kill Aku on numerous times, but Aku always says \"bye bye samurai.\" Time after time, these two have drawn into battle, but neither side wins all the way through. In a episode of Samurai Jack, it showed Jack as a much older man stepping on the body of Aku. So it seems that Jack will destroy Aku when he is in his elderly age.</p><h2>Physical Appearance</h2><p>Aku is supposed to look like a demon. However, since it's a kids TV Show/Comic, the creator had to turn down the notch so it could appeal to children 8-12. Drawn with great big eyes, flaming eye-brows, and a flaming beard Aku is the most adorable and laughable character in the Tv Show/Comic. Constantly turing into funny and strange things, Mako plays out the entire part of Aku. Making it feel more \"Kid-Friendly.\"</p><h2>Television Show</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337713-aku.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1337713\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 268px\" data-ratio=\"1.5970149253731\" data-width=\"268\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337713-aku.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1337713\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" data-width=\"268\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337713-aku.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337713-aku.jpg 268w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337713-aku.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1337713-aku.jpg 268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" data-width=\"268\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Samurai Jack and Aku are the main characters in the show, \"Samurai Jack.\" Aku is played by voice actor, Mako and Samurai Jack is voiced by Phil Lamarr.

He can also change his size, liquefy himself, stretch, and expand his body. Aku's consciousness can exist even in a part of himself. He typically changes into animal forms that are threatening to fit certain situations, such as a scorpion or an octopus. He is however limited to his own colour scheme, no matter what form he takes it will always be black, red and green.</li></ul><p><span><b>Forms he has taken :</b></span></p><ul><li>Bird (uses mostly to escape ) used lots of time</li><li>Scorpion :used in I and XXX also shown in opening titles</li><li>Gorrila:used in I</li><li>Billy Goat:used in I</li><li>Octopus:used in VIII and briefly seen in XXXVIII</li><li>Manta Ray:used in VIII</li><li>Spiked Tubeworm Forest:used in VIII</li><li>Spider:used in XXXVIII</li><li>Dark Tentacled being:used in I but also shown in begining opening titles</li><li>Dragon:used in XIII</li><li>Chinese Dragon:used in XXX</li><li>Preying Mantis:used in XXX</li><li>Mouse:used in XXX</li><li>Frog:used in XXXIV</li><li>Fish:used in XXXIV</li><li>Flying Dragon:used in XXXVIII</li><li>Dark Mass of shadow tentacles:used in XXX</li><li>Bat: used in XLVIII</li></ul><ul><li><b>Superhuman Strength:</b> When Aku challenged Jack to a so called final match he was shown to have superhuman strength even in a somewhat human form.</li><li><b>Limited Invulnerability:</b> Aku has shown the ability easily withstand weapons of any sort, such as simply absorbing arrows shot at him or not even being fazed after being hit by torpedoes as well as being capable of breathing underwater and existing in the depths of space, however he was shown to be vulnerable against mystic weapons and the weapons and artifacts of Deities and especially Jack's blade which was forged through the very essence of purity within his father by the Deities Odin, Ra and Vishnu.</li><li><b>Fire Generation:</b> Along with being capable of breathing fire Aku has also been shown creating it such as in one comical situation he had to re-ignite his eyebrows.</li><li><b>Time Travel:</b> This was the very ability that Aku had used to send Jack into the future at the beginning of the series, though so far it has only been used once and was a one way portal forward in time.</li><li><b>Laser Eye Beams:</b> Aku used this ability in numerous battles with Jack and he also used it to destroy the majority of Jack's Kingdom.</li><li><b>Teleportation:</b> Aku uses this quite often to appear before those he has business with, such as the<a href=\"http://samuraijack.wikia.com/wiki/Imakandi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Imakandi</a>.</li><li><b>Summoning Storms:</b> Aku is capable of conjuring storms through will.</li><li><b>Magic Materialization:</b> The ability to create objects out of thin air.

Aku's body is immune to nearly all forms of physical injury. If wounded, the wounds inflicted upon him will regenerate in moments. He can only be harmed and finally defeated by Samurai Jack's sword. It is notable that Aku is also vulnerable to various magical and divine attacks (such as the powers and artifacts of gods).</p><p>Aku needs no food, drink, or air and is capable of interstellar travel. He also has the ability to spy on Jack through a large sphere he can summon at will in his tower.</p><p>As Aku is a great and powerful wizard, he possesses a wide knowledge of magic that varies from episode to episode as the series demands.</p><h3><span>Weaknesses</span></h3><p>Despite his nearly omnipotent abilities, Aku has a few weaknesses. These include:</p><ul><li>His shapeshifting is limited to his red, green, and black color scheme, also, his reflection will show his normal form, no matter what guise he takes.</li><li>He can be harmed by magical objects and attacks.</li><li>In one episode (XLIII), he appears to have somehow caught the flu.</li><li>Although Aku can transform into any form, his reflection will show his normal form, most noticeable when Aku turns into a hermit, and asks Jack to look for the god's artifacts. When Jack and Aku are in the swamp, Aku shows his normal form even when he is transformed into his hermit form. He will always have the same reflection, so he splashes the water, and uses the ripples to hide his reflection.</li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Martha lives with her mother and two brothers in the Cabrini Green projects in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55728\" href=\"/chicago-illinois/4020-55728/\">Chicago</a>. They live in poverty. Though Martha is a decent student, she has a teacher who inspires her to try harder. When she discovers him murdered in his classroom, she's able to distract and injure his killer, the Ice Man (the thug of a local crime lord, the Pope), who dies before he can catch her. Martha is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where she learns that children there are being experimented on, secretly, genetically altering their brains. She's left homeless when budget cuts force the closure of the facility. She joins the PAX Peace Force, and that is where her adventures truly begin...</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Martha was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\" href=\"/frank-miller/4040-7082/\">Frank Miller</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-4941\" href=\"/dave-gibbons/4040-4941/\">Dave Gibbons</a>.

After he realized that Dewoz was not in fact an Alpha Primitive, he continued to force Dewoz to work with the other primitives due to his physical resemblance.  It was thought that Carthus was being mentally controlled by Maximus the Mad to do this to Dewoz, but was never truly revealed.  It is possible due to Carthus's duty as guard over Maximus the Mad when Maximus was imprisoned.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Jukko was once part of the Finnish Bear Force a group of elite soldier who were candidates for possible super-human therapy as the Finnish lack natural super-heroes. However Jukko refuse out of fear of what he could become however his more ambitious brother join, Lemminkäinen. Within short time Lemminkäinen became the first fully power Finnish man but he was far from hero, he used his power of dominance over will to take control of the Finnish population make him them believe that they all needed to become super-power individuals. And then begun the madness as millions when through the experiment just as many millions die unable to survive the processes. One of the many survivors was a man by the name of <i>Pekka Viljo</i> who develop the ability to cast psi-wall covering Finland double as the 'Masking Wall'. Jukko's brother was obsess in given him powers but Jukko resister everything for eight-months until one day he was unable to take anymore of it. The process by which Lemminkäinen give other super-power included scanning their minds in order to find what they wanted and then simple given it to them, in Jukko's case the ability to share other pain to show the world what monster his brother was. Once the process was done Lemminkäinen asked for handshake from his brother and Jukko did just that and while the pain he received from his brother was high his brother was instantly incinerated. Yet the pain was not over Lemminkäinen was connected to Finland and so die millions along with Pekka Viljo who became a sort of psi-ghost forever allowing the Masking Wall to exist. Jukko joined Team Achilles as representative of his nation and monitoring super-human activities.</p><p><b>Powers</b>: Jukko can feel others pain for three-kilometer radius, when sleep it shrinks to half a kilometer, he can turn this pain back on people but only upon touching them. He is incredible skill in guns and physical combat with equal only to <a href=\"../../midnighter/29-2196/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Midnighter</a> who is know for his incredible skills.</p>",

    "deck": "A Superman villainess who can use magic thanks to her Mists of Ibella.  She was known for selling fake kryptonite to various villains of the world.",
    "description": "<h2>Origins</h2><p>Lourdes Lucero's father spent his life looking for the mystical \"Mists of Ibella\", but when he found them he was driven insane. Fighting to resist succumbing to the power of the mists, on his deathbed he charged Lourdes with destroying them to protect their family. However, Lourdes felt no need to resist the mists and took their container from her father on his deathbed, using their powers to become the Encantadora. <br /></p><h2> Major Story Arcs</h2><p>As the Encantadora, Lourdes sells fake<a data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\" href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\">                   Kryptonite</a>  to several villains, such as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\" href=\"/riddler/4005-3718/\">                 Riddler</a>. When they find out about her deception, they seek revenge on her, but she is rescued by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\">   Superman</a>. Encantadora gives Clark a kiss and is sent to jail, but escapes with the Mists by making one of the guards fall in love with her.<br />Lourdes appears later while Christmas shopping, followed by two man under her influence. She comments to them that if they keep \"attentive\" she would let them see her try on her present from a lingerie shop.  <br />In a fight with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7367\" href=\"/demon/4005-7367/\">      Etrigan</a>, while trying to help Superman her mists are stolen. Etrigan immediately uses them to make people to face their inner demons. Superman quells the disturbance and Encantadora is apparently left powerless. Wanting to warm her Superman gives her his cape, at which she abruptly teleports away with the perfect Christmas present for her brother who is a huge fan of Superman.<br />When Encantadora kissed Superman, she passed a single Nano-bot into his body. The nano-bot starts to systematically destroy his cells, slowly killing him cell by cell. The Encantadora finds her conscience bothering her, however, and she warns Lois Lane who seeks help could be found to save Superman.<br />When the villain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\" href=\"/ras-al-ghul/4005-40816/\">         Ra's </a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\" href=\"/ras-al-ghul/4005-40816/\">          al Ghul </a>kidnaps her brother Victor, he threatens to kill him unless she uses the Mists of Ibella to infuse the Lazarus Pits with her power. Superman and<a data-ref-id=\"4005-4917\" href=\"/talia/4005-4917/\">  Talia Head </a>  intervene and reunite Encantadora with her brother. Superman brings her to the authorities and she vows that she will turn over a new leaf. Superman takes the necklace containing her mists and flies away. Mid-flight the mists vanish from his grasp and, realizing what Lourdes did, he wishes her the best of luck on her second chance. <br /></p><h2>Powers</h2><p>With the Mists, Encantadora can use magic and teleport. Although she has one of the most powerful, magical artifacts known to man, she has stated that she knows very little about the Mists' source, capabilities, and limits (in fact,Etrigan had a bigger control over the mists than she). Encantadora keeps the Mists on a necklace that she wears. </p><p>Although she seems to be nearly powerless with the Mists, she has harnessed some of the It's power, and can teleport at will, without having the the Mists in her possession. Although it is not understood how far her powers can stretch, she almost killed Superman, by releasing a nano-bot into his body, that slowly destroyed his cells (resulting in the death of the villain<a data-ref-id=\"4005-4690\" href=\"/parasite/4005-4690/\">      Parasite</a>). One of her most special powers is pheromone secretion that causes men to fall in love with her,obeing her commands. Another special ability granted to her by the Mists of Ibella, is the ability to manipulate people's perception of reality. Using this power she caused Superman to believe he was being affected by fake Kryptonite despite that fact that he knew it was fake. <br /> <br />She is known to have a very sensual personality.<br /></p>",

This hurt Kalikya deeply.</p><p>Later during a human siege on the Inhuman city of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-44155\" href=\"/attilan/4020-44155/\">Attilan</a>, Kalikya's true powers would manifest.  While the circumstances of the discovery of her powers has not been revealed, Kalikya's long slender hands contained the ability to heal injury and illness in those she touched.  While humans were attacking Attilan she would be employed on the front line as a healer.  Tonaja realized what had actually occurred when Dinu was injured on the front lines of battle and rushed Dinu to Kalikya to be healed.  Embarrassed by the way she neglected her once friend Tonaja extended an offer of friendship to Kalikya once more.  Still hurt by Tonaja's desertion after her apparent useless mutation in the Terrigen Mists, Kalikya rejected Tonaja's offer by telling her that she did not think so.  Rather than an embarrassment of Inhuman society, a pointless mutation, Kalikya had a purpose and an important one at that.  Rather than living in the Inhuman ghetto, Kalikya would become a prominent member of society working closely with the royal family.</p><p>Later Kalikya would be used by the royal family to heal <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\" href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\">Crystal</a>'s human husband <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\" href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\">Quicksilver</a> when he lost his powers during the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\" href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\">House of M</a>, although since there was nothing wrong with him she could not undo the change made to him.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Powers</h2><p>Kalikya's elongated hands and fingers act as a conduit for her healing ability.  Using her powers she can heal others.  Because of the practical uses of such a power this makes Kalikya an important member of Inhuman society.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Early Life</p><p>=======</p><p>At the age of twelve, Jean-Yves' family was murdered by the Jamaican Posse. Upon witnessing their death, Jean-Yves' latent spb abilities manifested, spelling the demise of the Posse assailants . Fearing for his life, a close friend of his family sent him to live with his godparents in Brooklyn, NY. There he would spend the remainder of his teenage years.</p><p>CIA and Beyond</p><p>=======</p><p>After graduating high school, Jean-Yves joined the C.I.A. where he'd put his special abilities to use, but after several years of service he was disavowed due to his short fuse and inability to work with other field operatives. Since then he has taken the alias Serge and made his talents available to anyone who could afford him. Serge is premier a gun for hire, who primarily works as a bodyguard or avenger for those who have been done an injustice.</p><p>Branum</p><p>=======</p> <p>When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25978\" href=\"/backlash/4005-25978/\" slug=\"backlash\">  Backlash</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24920\" href=\"/taboo/4005-24920/\" slug=\"taboo\">  Taboo</a> were trying to clear Taboo's name they were led to a former associate Dr. Branum who had hired Serge to defend him. Along with his partner <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44446\" href=\"/mahkinot/4005-44446/\" slug=\"mahkinot\">  Mahkinot</a> they were able to fend off the team with ease, until a common enemy forced them to pair up since they both needed Branum alive. Until then Serge was easily standing toe-to-toe with Backlash a rather difficult opponent to most. When the enemies overpowering them and Backlash down they needed to retreat. Serge carried Backlash to his ship and helped Reed and him escape the incoming attacks. Unfourtunately they were overpowered and captured by a vampiric alien named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52132\" href=\"/lilitu/4005-52132/\" slug=\"lilitu\"> Lilitu</a> of Sumeria. She forced him under her control and he helped restrain Taboo so she could take part in a ceremony. When Backlash returned form the dead he fought and freed Serge. After they defeated the vampires Backlash returned Serge back to his ship.</p><p>Wildcore</p><p>=======</p><p>Years later Jean found himself in a club being attacked by someone in armor similar to Taboo's, he called Backlash and when they showed up he greeted them with stakes and crucifixes. It turned out Lilitu had returned to again try and claim Calibus's power. This time she had both symbiotic armors, Taboo's and the one who attacked Serge. It was up to Backlash, Jodi, Taboo, and Serge to keep her from getting this power and fighting off hordes of vampires. It turned out Calibus did not want Lilitu to have his power so he instead gave them to Taboo, tilting the odds in the teams favor. With this power boost the team defeated Lilitu a second and hopefully last time and the team parted ways with Serge.</p>",

    "description": "<p>When George Washington was on his deathbed, several of the founding fathers used a spell to make him immortal so he could protect the country forever. Since then, Citizen Soldier has been reencarnated endlessly so he could fight in every war the US was in. In addition to the hundreds of years of experience this has given him, Citizen Soldier has superhuman strength (for instance, as newborn he was able to take the door off a shipping container), speed and agility as well as the ability to grant others powers for a limited time. He carries a shield similar to Captain America's, but also uses machine guns in battle. He has recently become dissatisfied with the way America is going and has started to fight against his own country.</p>",

    "description": "<p>After investigating what appears to be a gang-related murder, Detective Lieutenant David Grey of the LAPD finds that the only witness who comes forward is a young man who grew up with the deceased, he says that the young man laying in a pool of rain water and his own blood only a few yards away was moving illegal drugs for a man named Jaeker, who is under the protection of a group called ‘The Men’. Just when the informant has mentioned this an unmarked black van screeches to a stop and shines it high-beams at the officer and the young man, surprisingly the van turns away and in the confusion the young man disappears into the night.</p> <p>Back at the station, Grey’s Captain feels that this case is better left alone since gang members killing each other is progress in his book.</p> <p>Sometime later, Grey is called to the scene of a grizzly homicide. The walls and ceiling of an apartment splattered with blood. The remains have been cut apart and placed in various areas of the apartment almost as a bad joke... and a warning to others. He finds the head in the refrigerator with the eyes taken out and scrawled in blood on the back wall says: “TALKS TOO MUCH”. Grey recognizes the head as belonging to the young man who came forward earlier.</p> <p>Grey decides that recent events put Jaeker at the top of his list of suspects for both murders. After looking references to ‘The Men’ and finding nothing, he looked up Jaeker’s rap sheet and found it was as long as his arm and an out-state-Warrant from Washington. He decided it was time to bring Jaeker in.</p> <p>He led a squad to Jaeker’s apartment building and got about halfway up the stairs when the lights were cut. Grey quickly found that his squad was torn apart and he was alone against a group of goblin-like creatures with wide <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\" href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" slug=\"joker\">Joker</a>-like grins, as Jaeker ordered them to kill him. Grey was able to get off a couple shots which sent Jaeker though the window from several stories up. Grey however finds himself tackled. A man appears and reaches into Grey’s chest without breaking the skin and Grey blacks out.</p> <p>David wakes in a hospital to find that he can see through everyone else and no one can hear him except for one woman, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44182\" href=\"/laurel/4005-44182/\" slug=\"laurel\">Laurel</a>. She says he is in the place in-between and that she is to be his guide until he they find and kill him or until he turns, in which case she’ll kill him, any questions?</p> <p>After refusing to answer any of David’s questions, only repeating what she said earlier, she takes him to see the man who answers questions, but not before seeing the same black van that Grey had seen before a seeming lifetime ago. He thinks back and it all comes back the bodies, the creatures, and the man reaching into his chest, David wonders if she is dead. Laurel says, ‘No. Almost. But not quite. Not yet.’</p> <p>Shortly, they come to an elderly man named ‘<a data-ref-id=\"4005-59241\" href=\"/laz/4005-59241/\" slug=\"laz\">Laz</a>’, who seems to be looking for something, but is rather mysterious about that it is, Laurel says that Arthur says Laz is looking for his death.</p> <p>Eventually, they come to a run-down part of town; David admits he doesn’t think he’s been this way before. They walk into an old factory full of what appears to be vagrants. When they walk in everyone seems to be in awe of Laurel.</p> <p>They find Arthur, who is the one who answers questions, he tells his story as man who fell between the cracks and became part of the In-between, how he just slowly became forgotten and then invisible. When David notes that it’s not the same as what happened to him. Arthur almost looks upon with pity and explains that the Goblin creatures and the Men also known as the Walkers are one and the same, that the Man that David saw reach into his chest is the same man who created the Walkers. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44183\" href=\"/soul-stealer/4005-44183/\" slug=\"soul-stealer\">Soul Stealer</a>. He goes on to say that when that man reached into his chest, he took something, David Grey’s soul. He approximately a year before he becomes a Walker himself.</p> <p>Laurel later explains that they must go to New York to get David’s soul back, and they’ll have to walk from L.A. Everyone else at the factory seems excited at the prospect of Laurel taking another on a walk. Laz joins them for a bit and explains in his own way with Laurel’s help that Laz is short for Lazarus who was brought back from the dead by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jesus Christ</a>. Apparently Jesus had requested that Laz wait for his return once he was done having supper with his twelve friends. So Laz waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually he had found that he had fallen through the cracks and was the first to find the In-between.</p> <p>They come to another cell of people who have become part of the In-between whose children were taken by the Walkers, David chooses to help get the children back and with Laurel and Laz’s help he does, during the struggle one of the Walkers recognizes Laurel and calls her by name. It gives Laurel hope for him. Laz stays behind as they continue to New York.</p> <p>Just off a deserted highway they find a group of people huddled around a campfire, they introduce themselves and quickly find that this group is quite paranoid even to the extent that they refuse to leave the confines of the light made by the fire. This disgusts David who chooses to climb over the next rise and discovers that there are dozens of campfires just like the one he left, each with 6 to 8 campers around it, each just as paranoid as the last.</p> <p>One night David dreams of the freedom of being a Walker, terrorizing the people of the In-between, reveling in murder and feeling alive. He wakes up screaming. Laurel seems to know what he dreamt and says that it wasn’t a dream, it was a promise.</p> <p>They quickly find that they are being followed by a Walker, Grey attacks it and Laurel goes to intervene and it says her name again and asks for help. Once the Walker is safely tied up, Laurel explains that this walker was the guy who had gotten his soul taken and taken the walk to New York just before David. The Walker explains that he saved money for his daughter for college and wanted to make sure that his family got the account number and such. Laurel mentions that it breaks the rules and that there will be repercussions, but helps him anyway. The Walker tells Grey that it would probably just be easier for him if he let Laurel kill him before New York. When Laurel asks what he said, Grey says ‘Nothing’. The Walker is quickly retrieved and slaughtered by his own.</p> <p>Weeks pass and Laurel admits that she keeps her distance from her the people she escorts because every time she sees a Walker it reminds her that she’s failed over and over again. Which makes David question if she’s here for him, or is he here for her. To which for the first time she has no smart-ass comeback.</p> <p>They come north to Chicago, Laurel points out that they probably lost time for it, but David says he just wanted to see the city one last time before… the truth of the matter is that David’s estranged wife now lives in Chicago. He wanted to see her one last time, even if she couldn’t see him.</p> <p>He enters her apartment and seems to be a ghost to her as she talks on the phone to her mother and then showers. He leaves her a note from a crumpled up piece of paper and a thrown away lipstick which reads: </p> <p>I’M SORRY.</p> <p>FORGIVE ME.</p> <p>FORGET ME.</p> <p>I LOVE YOU.</p> <p>DAVID</p> <p>He returns to Laurel and tells her what happened since he kept her waiting, in her anger she explains that the Walkers are always watching and their job is not to kill David, but to break him, and easy way to do that is to kill and otherwise harm his loved ones. He gets back to her apartment to find her missing. They catch a Walker and they find out that she’s been taken to an empty apartment nearby.</p> <p>David’s wife, Sarah is drugged and manipulated into believing that David has abandoned her even as David and Laurel fight their way into the building. The Walkers attempt to get Sarah to commit suicide as David bursts in and attacks them. Sarah panics and runs out the fire access to the roof.</p> <p>She nearly falls off, but David is able to catch her before and she passes out. Laurel explains that he was able to touch her at all because he’s beginning to tap into his abilities as a Walker to pass between the mundane world and the In-between, the more he uses them the faster they grow.</p> <p>Months later, David has a waking dream of being a Walker and attacks several innocent bystanders, Laurel stops him but only just. They make camp in a warehouse for the night and Laurel asks him if she wants to make it easier on him and simply kill him now, but he shouldn’t answer right away, he has to hear the other side before making his choice. With that she walks out into the snow.</p> <p>Minutes later there is a knock on the door and David is greeted by four Walkers who grab an old radio out of their van. They set the radio down on the floor and set a chair next to it, one of the Walkers hugs him. Finally despite that it is not plugged in a voice comes out of the radio and tells David that everything he believes is a lie.</p> <p>Outside, several yards away, Laurel wants to give up. Inside, the voice offers an example, that if the Walkers wanted to, they could kill David at any time and they choose not to. Now the voice only asks that David touch the dial on the radio as a show of faith, pointing out that Laurel knew the Walkers were coming and let David meet with them anyway, knowing that he trusts her. David does so and finds himself in a very different New York. It seems to be covered in stone and wood instead of glass and steel. There standing higher up on the roof of a building is a blue skinned man with black-holes for irises, he goes on about how creation is a lie since it’s built upon the promise that things will get better, he cites examples of the misery in the world. He goes on to explain that he wishes to expose the creator for the sham that he is. </p> <p>David is transported back to the warehouse and the Walkers leave. Laurel returns in the morning. Telling him not to repeat what ‘The Other Guy’ said she simply says that he needs to decide if he wants Laurel to end it there or not. David explains how once after Sarah left him, once he realized he had lost her, he put his service revolver to his head. Just as he was about to pull the trigger, a friend called and invited him to a Dodgers game. He had the receiver in one hand and his revolver in the other. He chose the baseball game; he figured that the gun was always there if he changed his mind. He decided to take his chances; just he was now, with the Other Guy and with Laurel. In that moment, Laurel took him in her arms and held him. They walked out of the warehouse together as friends. She added on that she’d have to ask that question a mere two more times.</p> <p>Ten months into their walk the strain of the constant traveling along with his ‘infection’ was getting to David. They had fought their way through legions of Walkers, it came time for Laurel to ask David a second time if he wanted her to kill him here, and finally David snapped. He brutally attacked Laurel; he moved and acted very much as a Walker would. Laurel is able to talk him back to reality. David profusely apologizes for losing it. Later after he’s recovered, he offers to take the remainder of the walk alone, but Laurel says it isn’t allowed. She adds that no one would be around to talk David back if the madness struck again. He asks what she does when she’s not escorting people to the end of the journey and she simply says that she’s at peace. But unfulfilled. Empty. Waiting. But it’s better than the pain.</p> <p>David stops dead in his tracks and asks who she is really, what is she? She says “I’m something… you could never understand, David. And I’m very old. And I’m very tired of walking. So let’s walk.” As she sleeps that night in across a campfire from him he watches her. Realizing that she hasn’t smiled or laughed in months and that his company causes her pain. He decides in that moment to strive not to be a burden on her, not to cause her anymore pain than absolutely necessary because he might very well be falling in love with her.</p> <p>In the days that follow, things improve slightly, she actually makes a joke at his expense, but at least it’s a joke. It is just then that in front of them that they see their path filled with Walkers. Evenly spaced along the road in a line. To get passed them David will have to fight and defeat them each one at a time and only call upon Laurel if he absolutely has to for help. Knowing that calling upon Laurel will cause her pain he attempts to go through them without calling upon her at all. He gets pretty far, but in the end he has no other option.</p> <p>Together they make it though, but both are in sore shape at the end. </p> <p>Laurel points out that the worst is not over as a figure approaches from the distance from the direction they are traveling. Laurel tells David that he must talk to him. David rightfully notes that Laurel is afraid of this guy. She quietly excuses herself and goes to a nearby cottage saying only that she’s been down this road before.</p> <p>David walks to meet the figure and is shocked to see an elderly man looking just like him with slight scarring where David has fresh cuts from his all too recent ordeal. When it comes right down to it, David only has one question, he asks if he succeeds in getting his soul back the elder David says no. So David asks what happens to Laurel and the elder says ‘We kill her after we get to New York.’</p> <p>Back in the cottage, David returns and Laurel says that she never finished asking before, so knowing now what he does about what will happen, does he want her to end it now? He attempts to sidestep the question and explain his feelings for her; she won’t listen and repeats the question. He lets out a quiet ‘no’ after a bit of thought. As they continue traveling he vows to himself that he won’t allow her to die, no matter what just as they arrive in New York City. </p> <p>New York in the In-between is basically Hell-on-Earth.</p> <p>Everything appears to be made from stone, just as it had in David’s earlier vision. They see Walkers openly selling drugs and causing misery in the In-between and in the real world.</p> <p>The ‘Other Guy’ meets them not long after they enter the city, and acknowledges that they made it there with almost a week to spare. He greets Laurel and she flinches away from him. David cuts to the chase and demands his soul back, but the Soul Stealer tells him that he has too much to learn before-hand. Without warning a large group of Walkers separate Laurel and David and carry them off to differing areas of the grounds.</p> <p>Laurel seems resigned to her fate as she’s gone though this so many times before, why should this time be any different?</p> <p>David after a brief incarceration is placed in a 2x2x7 box on wheels, so that he can only stand within it. Wrought Iron bars allow him to see 3/4ths of the way around him. The Other Guy simply says the box is to protect David from himself. The Other Guy takes the occasion to explain his side more clearly.</p> <p>“Let’s pretend for the moment, that you’re God.”</p> <p>“And really, why not? Everybody else does. People who failed Biology 101 and Basic Physics think that they can do as good a job at designing cosmologies and platypuses and comets as the maker of all things. Vanity.”</p> <p>“But even unskilled labor might produce a better result. At least their hearts would be in the right place.”</p> <p>“At least it wouldn’t be just one big tragic setup… A balloon waiting for someone to stick a pin in it and show it for the fraud it is.”<br/></p> <p>“But I digress. So. You’re God.”</p> <p>“How do you like it so far?”</p> <p>David takes the chance to tell him how stupid he finds the situation as Walkers prance past him wearing angelic wings, as they near a large, dark stone pit.</p> <p>The Other Guy continues…</p> <p>“Before you is the Void. The long Pre-creation hesitation, pregnant with possibilities, waiting to be born. Waiting to be.”</p> <p>“But most of all… silent. The most profound silence imaginable. Not just without sound, but before sound.”</p> <p>“And you—“</p> <p>“—you are alone.”</p> <p>“And really, who wants to be alone all the time? Especially since time hasn’t been invented yet.”</p> <p>“It’s a terrible loneliness beyond description.”</p> <p>“And even though you are… you cannon be… because there is no place for you to be in.”</p> <p>“So you create one.”</p> <p>“Because you’re alone.”</p> <p>“Because you can.”</p> <p>“Because is kills the time you just got around to inventing.”</p> <p>“Let there be light.”</p> <p>A dim light fills the stone pit and reveals Walkers within brandishing various scientific achievements, inventions, and discoveries. Fossils, atomic diagrams, models of the planets… etc. The Other Guy continues on with his monologue.</p> <p>“You slammed molecules together and blew them out into the void.”</p> <p>“Protons danced and wave-forms flickered. You ignited suns, nurtured nucleotides and exhaled proteins that would in time birth a Mozart and put knees of Flamingos on backward just for the variety and humor of it.”</p> <p>“As time passed – and what a handy little creation that was – you got better at it. You abandon single-celled creatures and work your way up from Protozoa to Saurians like a sculptor working his way up from a clay dog to a Mona Lisa.”</p> <p>“Too bad you have to hone your skills by killing all your failures. Even though they were innocent. Even though the fault was not theirs, but in your design. Because everything you create, dies.”</p> <p>Because press releases and pamphlets notwithstanding, you’re not perfect. If you were, you wouldn’t have done all this… all this…because you were alone.”</p> <p>“Because you feared the void.”</p> <p>“Because you had nothing better to do.”</p> <p>“Because you were bored.”</p> <p>“You even create others like yourself, but not quite as powerful, because that would be too great a threat. At least you think you created them because one day they were just there, and since you created “there” in the first place, then you must have created them, but you’ve been so busy working out this whole light-to-nutrient chlorophyll thing that you really can’t remember doing it.”</p> <p>“But then, neither can they.”</p> <p>“You tell them all you’re trying to create a better world. But if you’re as perfect as your biographers maintain, they why didn’t you get it right the first time?”</p> <p>“Why’d you screw up?”</p> <p>“Some of those around you ask just that question. You don’t like questions. Just obedience.”</p> <p>“But the questions continue. You try to stop them. You can’t.”</p> <p>“And then it’s war. A war of misery. A war about misery.”</p> <p>“Understand: Anyone would get bored doing nothing but designing worlds for eternity. You want to be entertained, and every author needs conflict.”</p> <p>“So you introduce misery into an equation predicated on what was supposed to be one simple proposition: The hope that tomorrow will be better than today.”</p> <p>“Have things gotten better? Are they continuing to get better? Is the promise valid? Or is the promise a lie?”</p> <p>“Money is not the root of all evil. Misery is. Misery starts wars, kills children, destroys souls. Misery proves the universe is uncaring and random and cruel. Misery proves that creation is a lie.”</p> <p>David pointedly asks: “Even if you’re the one causing it?”</p> <p>“We all cause it. You caused your share. You’ve seen that on the way here. Even with the best intentions, never meaning anyone harm… you’ve hurt people you loved and turned your back on others.”</p> <p>“And you’re still missing the point.”</p> <p>“You’re God. Everything that is, you made. So why not just leave misery out of the equation in the first place?”</p> <p>“It doesn’t exist naturally. Nothing does. Everything had to be created. Why go out of your way to create misery?”</p> <p>“That’s what this is about. That’s what the war is about.”</p> <p>“Removing misery from the equation.”</p> <p>“Removing loneliness. Removing pain. Removing guilt and longing and fear and regret.”</p> <p>“And removing those who would profit from it. Those who would feed it. Those who need it to feel they have a purpose.”</p> <p>“There is no Hell. There is no Heaven. No beyond to fear. No final exhalation of stars.”</p> <p>“There is only the cycle of life and death repeated infinitely.”</p> <p>“You come, you go, you come, you go, dying into instantaneous rebirth and birthing into inevitable death. And in all of it, your misery increases. More people, less food, more technology, less privacy.”</p> <p>“Bombs and Anthrax and Ebola, terror in the streets, doors locked against neighbors and anonymous crime, against community and each other. Mothers drowning their children because they can’t handle the stress of the very act of creation itself. They understand that what they bring in will know only misery so they end it, end it for themselves, for their children. They get it over with.”</p> <p>“Time for the children to return the favor. Time to overturn creation and start again. But how?”</p> <p>“You do it be accelerating the misery, revealing it for what it is, the primal flaw in creation’s design. Once there was only Lazarus, the first to fall between the cracks and be forgotten. More have come through every day, and every day that lie stands more and more revealed, the flaw in creation’s design becomes more evident, and finally everyone is on this side of the equation, not on the other side. My side. Not his side.”</p> <p>“And then… then it’s our turn to design a world of our own. A world without guilt, only pleasure. Without pain, only joy. Without limits. Utter absolute freedom.”</p> <p>“Feel the misery of the world, David Grey. For one second, I’m going to open your mind to the song of pain, the song I have been forced to hear every day and every night to the last syllable of recorded time.”</p> <p>“For just one fleeting second, David, feel the totality of the suffering and pain and misery of a world made deliberately flawed.”</p> <p>“And tell me the truth. Tell me honestly.”</p> <p>“Is this not a world that deserves to be put out of it’s misery?”</p> <p>David experiences the pain, agony, and misery in imagery that is forced into his brain and it drives him insane.</p> <p>Laurel hears David’s cry of pain and she’s knows exactly what has occurred. She looks to a couple of Walkers and they have tears in her their eyes. Prepared she is escorted to the Other Guy who says nothing so she continues on and finds David hunched over like the Walkers, he bears the marks all over his body as well and he looks at her hungrily as she pleads with him to listen and stay in the room with him.</p> <p>David in his insanity and rage remember that killing her is the very last thing he wants so he bolts from the room to protect her. His instinct is to run into the night.</p> <p>The Other Guy has some Walkers prepare “The Wheel”, a large flat, but round wooden table top, the Walkers reveal metal spikes and Laurel is escorted to it to cleanse herself as David runs free.</p> <p>After her bath, she is given a sparse meal and then she is carried without resistance to “The Wheel”. David, while running with a pack of Walkers sees a mannequin that reminds him of Laurel. He remembers everything they shared over the past year and realizes that somewhere along the way he fell in love with her, and that he has to help her.</p> <p>He sprints back to the Other Guy’s domicile and finds Laurel nailed to The Wheel. (similar to a crucifixion) The Other Guy says that Laurel will die and there’s nothing David can do to stop it, he can only affect how and why she dies. So he need not bother trying to save her, reminding him that he came for his soul, not for her.</p> <p>The Soul Stealer tells David that he needn’t worry so much over Laurel since she’s not even human anyway he shows David her true form, she appears as an energetic radiating feminine form. He goes to explain that she only comes to Earth when someone has been touched as he had touched David, he also says that every one who works in his service has regained their soul, the markings remain to signify that they are his property. Because without a soul, you belong nowhere. The deadline in important because if you go a year without regaining your soul you would be trapped between the two worlds, not fully in one or the other. Without a soul you are no use to either side, his or God’s, because you cannot choose. His soul is the coin he brings to the bargaining table, they want to make sure you have it in hand when it comes time.</p> <p>So, the choice is this: David can have his soul back and he would retain the markings of a Walker and remain in his service, but he would be whole again, he would live as long as the Other Guy does and when he no longer required his service his life would be his own. Or, He could give his soul to Laurel and end her cycle of pain, for she is not human and quite soulless. But, with a soul she could be born as any human would and live in hope and misery for a lifetime as any other human. But if he gives his soul to her, he will forever be a wanderer, trapped between worlds, the markings would fade, and he would no longer belong to the Other Guy, he would not belong anywhere. Today. Tomorrow. To the end of time itself.</p> <p>Choose.</p> <p>David looks upon the Walkers with disgust and pity. The Other Guy tells David not to perpetuate the lie any further, reminding him how hard he fought to regain his soul.</p> <p>David takes his soul into his hand (it appears as a small blue flame) and looks upon it and looks to the Walkers and then to the Other Guy, then to Laurel.</p> <p>He walks to her as she hang there dying. “I’m sorry, Laurel. I came all this way—“ she cuts him off. “I know… I forgive you, David.” He continues. “—but I guess I put you through all this for nothing.”</p> <p>Laurel manages eye contact in her pain. “…Nothing…?” </p> <p>David leans in close and whispers. “I love you.”</p> <p>With that he pushes his soul within her breast and a blue flash of light explodes from her and her angelic form soars up into the sky and shines like a beacon.</p> <p>All over the world, people in the In-between see the sign they have been waiting for, and for the first time experience true hope. Arthur, tears streaming down his face finds that people can see him. The people around the campfires at the beginning of the journey see it and smile. The Walkers look on in awe. And the Other Guy simply looks. He walks over to the rapidly fading body of David who is shivering and wondering why it is so cold. As he fades view the Other Guy simply notes, “Well. I certainly didn’t see that coming.”</p> <p>As Laurel returns to her place of peace she speaks with the voice that originally summoned her a year ago. She wants to make sure that David knew she loved him and that he had a lovely soul. The last thing she says is that she can feel her heart beating.</p> <p>David finds himself in tattered clothes on a street, but no markings. Everyone can see him on both sides of the metaphor. He is recognized as a LAPD Detective who went missing about a year ago.</p> <p>Sarah is at the hospital when he recovers, after he gets over the shock of what happens and doesn’t tell her about Laurel and says that he can only remember walking, she tells him about her experience in Chicago, how she knew he was there and he somehow saved her, though she barely remembers it through a drug induced haze. But she realized that she had to find him. Alive or dead.</p> <p>As they are leaving the hospital there is a newborn baby in a room they pass. The mother mentions that they had already chosen a name for her, but the moment she looked into her eyes she could only name her Laurel.</p> <p>As David and Sarah leave the hospital, David is confronted with some of the people of the In-between who hadn’t crossed over, they ask that he speak for them. He says he’ll try his best.</p> <p>Epilogue</p> <p>David finds himself on the same road where he met himself several years earlier and has the exact same conversation. </p> <p>David walks to meet the figure and is shocked to see an elderly man looking just like him with slight scarring where David has fresh cuts from his all too recent ordeal. When it comes right down to it, David only has one question, he asks if he succeeds in getting his soul back the elder David says no. So David asks what happens to Laurel and the elder says ‘We kill her after we get to New York.’</p> <p>The elder David walks back to a car waiting for him with Laz behind the wheel. When David asks how that worked exactly, Laz simply says that he has connections. Laz tells David that he should cheer up because he’s a hero. David says that he doesn’t feel very much like a hero. Laz points out that the trouble with being a hero is that you’re expected to make these sacrifices and save people and expect nothing in return. David has helped a lot of people on both sides of the metaphor over the years, given a lot of people hope. While a lot of people have thanked him for it the one person who David cared to hear it from never had the chance to say it.</p> <p>With that he drops off David nowhere near where he picked him up. So David walks to a nearby park and sit and enjoys the weather. After several minutes he hears a voice of a young girl asking if he’s okay. He says he’s okay and looks up to see Laurel as a young teenager wearing a tee-shirt that says “Angel”. Her mother calls her and tells her they’re going to be late. Laurel turns to leave but she stops and smiles at David and simply says “Thank you.”</p> <p>David is moved to tears and watches her go. He gets a call on his walkie-talkie asking for assistance. He tells him he’ll be there. And then says “I’ll always be there.” To himself.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Laurel’s history prior to her meeting <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44181\" href=\"/david-grey/4005-44181/\" slug=\"david-grey\">David Grey</a> for the first time is somewhat sketchy. She seemed to float freely in perfect joy. She felt no pain; she had no stress to speak of, and could speak freely with… the voice (or God). One could believe that she was in Heaven. When the voice informed her it was time to return to the world to attempt to save someone soul, she hesitated. She did not want to experience the pain of life, the pain of her trial.</p> <p>She relented and appeared before David Grey, who’s soul had been taken by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44183\" href=\"/soul-stealer/4005-44183/\" slug=\"soul-stealer\">Soul Stealer</a>. After bringing David up to speed on what has really happened to him, they begin the arduous journey from Los Angeles to New York City by foot to reclaim David’s soul. She makes it clear that she has done this several times in the past and no one has ever succeeded.</p> <p>Most of the journey consists of seeming tests for David, he is confronted with trials that both not only test him, but Laurel as well, as his soul missing he is slowly becoming a Walker. A group of creatures that belongs to the Soul Stealer it is their job to bring misery to the world, and they seem to attack her and David at every turn.</p> <p>David passes the tests, not always with flying colors, but he does pass. When all is said and done and they are in New York City, David fully succumbs to being a Walker and runs off into the night. Laurel is left being a prisoner of the Soul Stealer who admits to loving her, it being partly the reason she is chosen for these trials.</p> <p>David miraculously snaps out of it and returns, but finds Laurel nailed by her hands and feet to a round wooden, upright table called “the Wheel”, the Soul Stealer tells David that there is nothing he can do to save Laurel, he can merely choose why she dies.</p> <p>The Soul Stealer offers David his soul telling him that he’s worked so hard to get it back over a year’s time, but he could choose if he wanted to give it to Laurel as she’s not even human, she could live as a mortal, grow up in the harsh world and die as a mortal… or he could do what he set out to do in the first place and take his soul back.</p> <p>He does point out that every Walker has indeed regained their souls, their marking that make them Walkers are simply to denote that they are the Soul Stealer’s property, that they belong somewhere, whereas David does not currently, but he can.</p> <p>David looks to the assembled Walkers and asks, “Not a single one of you ever gave…?” they can do nothing but avert their eyes from him.</p> <p>David, knowing this likely means not only his death, but a possible eternity in limbo walks up to Laurel and says he is sorry and then plunges his soul into her breast, telling her simply that he loves her.</p> <p>Her true form revealed glowing and winged soars up into the sky free of all mortal limitations and flares as bright as the sun. People all over the world see the sign and it’s enough to give them hope.</p> <p>As the light fades, Laurel returns to her place of peace she speaks with the voice that originally summoned her a year ago. She wants to make sure that David knew she loved him and that he had a lovely soul. The last thing she says is that she can feel her heart beating…</p> <p>Fourteen years later, David walks to a nearby park and sits to enjoy the weather. After several minutes he hears a voice of a young girl asking if he’s okay. He says he’s okay and looks up to see Laurel as a young teenager wearing a tee-shirt that says “Angel”. Her mother calls her and tells her they’re going to be late. Laurel turns to leave but she stops and smiles at David and simply says “Thank you.”</p>",

    "deck": "\"The Soul Stealer\" is a major character in JMS' series \"Midnight Nation\". He was never referred to by a proper name, but is referred to as The Other Guy and Soul Stealer. He is essentially Satan.",
    "description": "<p>The Soul Stealer is seemingly immortal, and wishes primarily to bring more misery to the world to expose God’s promise for the sham he sees it to be.</p><p>He explains his manifesto quite eloquently in the following monologue.</p><p>“Let’s pretend for the moment, that you’re God.” </p><p>“And really, why not? Everybody else does. People who failed Biology 101 and Basic Physics think that they can do as good a job at designing cosmologies and platypuses and comets as the maker of all things. Vanity.” </p><p>“But even unskilled labor might produce a better result. At least their hearts would be in the right place.” </p><p>“At least it wouldn’t be just one big tragic setup… A balloon waiting for someone to stick a pin in it and show it for the fraud it is.”</p><p>“But I digress. So. You’re God.” </p><p>“How do you like it so far?”</p><p>David takes the chance to tell him how stupid he finds the situation as Walkers prance past him wearing angelic wings, as they near a large, dark stone pit.</p><p>The Other Guy continues…</p><p>“Before you is the Void. The long Pre-creation hesitation, pregnant with possibilities, waiting to be born. Waiting to be.” </p><p>“But most of all… silent. The most profound silence imaginable. Not just without sound, but before sound.” </p><p>“And you—\" </p><p>“—you are alone.” </p><p>“And really, who wants to be alone all the time? Especially since time hasn’t been invented yet.” </p><p>“It’s a terrible loneliness beyond description.” </p><p>“And even though you are… you cannon be… because there is no place for you to be in.” </p><p>“So you create one.” </p><p>“Because you’re alone.” </p><p>“Because you can.” </p><p>“Because is kills the time you just got around to inventing.” </p><p>“Let there be light.”</p><p>A dim light fills the stone pit and reveals Walkers within brandishing various scientific achievements, inventions, and discoveries. Fossils, atomic diagrams, models of the planets… etc. The Other Guy continues on with his monologue.</p><p>“You slammed molecules together and blew them out into the void.” </p><p>“Protons danced and wave-forms flickered. You ignited suns, nurtured nucleotides and exhaled proteins that would in time birth a Mozart and put knees of Flamingos on backward just for the variety and humor of it.” </p><p>“As time passed – and what a handy little creation that was – you got better at it. You abandon single-celled creatures and work your way up from Protozoa to Saurians like a sculptor working his way up from a clay dog to a Mona Lisa.” </p><p>“Too bad you have to hone your skills by killing all your failures. Even though they were innocent. Even though the fault was not theirs, but in your design. Because everything you create, dies.” </p><p>\"Because press releases and pamphlets notwithstanding, you’re not perfect. If you were, you wouldn’t have done all this… all this…because you were alone.” </p><p>“Because you feared the void.” </p><p>“Because you had nothing better to do.” </p><p>“Because you were bored.” </p><p>“You even create others like yourself, but not quite as powerful, because that would be too great a threat. At least you think you created them because one day they were just there, and since you created “there” in the first place, then you must have created them, but you’ve been so busy working out this whole light-to-nutrient chlorophyll thing that you really can’t remember doing it.” </p><p>“But then, neither can they.” </p><p>“You tell them all you’re trying to create a better world. But if you’re as perfect as your biographers maintain, they why didn’t you get it right the first time?” </p><p>“Why’d you screw up?” </p><p>“Some of those around you ask just that question. You don’t like questions. Just obedience.” </p><p>“But the questions continue. You try to stop them. You can’t.” </p><p>“And then it’s war. A war of misery. A war about misery.” </p><p>“Understand: Anyone would get bored doing nothing but designing worlds for eternity. You want to be entertained, and every author needs conflict.” </p><p>“So you introduce misery into an equation predicated on what was supposed to be one simple proposition: The hope that tomorrow will be better than today.” </p><p>“Have things gotten better? Are they continuing to get better? Is the promise valid? Or is the promise a lie?” </p><p>“Money is not the root of all evil. Misery is. Misery starts wars, kills children, destroys souls. Misery proves the universe is uncaring and random and cruel. Misery proves that creation is a lie.”</p><p>David pointedly asks: “Even if you’re the one causing it?”</p><p>“We all cause it. You caused your share. You’ve seen that on the way here. Even with the best intentions, never meaning anyone harm… you’ve hurt people you loved and turned your back on others.” </p><p>“And you’re still missing the point.” </p><p>“You’re God. Everything that is, you made. So why not just leave misery out of the equation in the first place?” </p><p>“It doesn’t exist naturally. Nothing does. Everything had to be created. Why go out of your way to create misery?” </p><p>“That’s what this is about. That’s what the war is about.” </p><p>“Removing misery from the equation.” </p><p>“Removing loneliness. Removing pain. Removing guilt and longing and fear and regret.” </p><p>“And removing those who would profit from it. Those who would feed it. Those who need it to feel they have a purpose.” </p><p>“There is no Hell. There is no Heaven. No beyond to fear. No final exhalation of stars.” “There is only the cycle of life and death repeated infinitely.” </p><p>“You come, you go, you come, you go, dying into instantaneous rebirth and birthing into inevitable death. And in all of it, your misery increases. More people, less food, more technology, less privacy.” </p><p>“Bombs and Anthrax and Ebola, terror in the streets, doors locked against neighbors and anonymous crime, against community and each other. Mothers drowning their children because they can’t handle the stress of the very act of creation itself. They understand that what they bring in will know only misery so they end it, end it for themselves, for their children. They get it over with.” </p><p>“Time for the children to return the favor. Time to overturn creation and start again. But how?” </p><p>“You do it be accelerating the misery, revealing it for what it is, the primal flaw in creation’s design. Once there was only Lazarus, the first to fall between the cracks and be forgotten. More have come through every day, and every day that lie stands more and more revealed, the flaw in creation’s design becomes more evident, and finally everyone is on this side of the equation, not on the other side. My side. Not his side.” </p><p>“And then… then it’s our turn to design a world of our own. A world without guilt, only pleasure. Without pain, only joy. Without limits. Utter absolute freedom.” </p><p>“Feel the misery of the world, David Grey. For one second, I’m going to open your mind to the song of pain, the song I have been forced to hear every day and every night to the last syllable of recorded time.” </p><p>“For just one fleeting second, David, feel the totality of the suffering and pain and misery of a world made deliberately flawed.” </p><p>“And tell me the truth. Tell me honestly.” </p><p>“Is this not a world that deserves to be put out of it’s misery?”</p><p>David experiences the pain, agony, and misery in imagery that is forced into his brain and it drives him insane.</p><p>The Soul Stealer apparently was an angel who rebelled against God some time ago and now is attempting to create more misery than God’s creation can handle, proving that his promise of a better tomorrow is a sham. He does this by creating servitors called the Walkers, that sell drugs, rape and kill when ever or however he chooses them to.</p><p>At some point a deal was struck. The promise would be tested, every so often a person’s soul could be taken and that person’s resolve would be tested. Would they let misery overtake them or would they act selflessly in the interests of a better tomorrow?</p><p>Another Angel, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44182\" href=\"/laurel/4005-44182/\" slug=\"laurel\">Laurel</a> who the Soul Stealer loved before his fall, was chosen to guide those who’s soul was taken to the Soul Steal to seemingly retrieve it, but in truth they had been chosen to see if they were capable of a selfless act after a year of trial.</p><p>Many were chosen and they all failed, they took their soul and chose servitude to the Soul Stealer rather than choosing in favor of  hope, proving that the promise is valid. At the end of each trial Laurel died and returned to her place of rest, her own embers of hope slowly dying.</p><p>Finally, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44181\" href=\"/david-grey/4005-44181/\" slug=\"david-grey\">David Grey</a> managed to realize the truth, and sacrificed his soul to give it to Laurel and she was giving the opportunity to live life as a human, proving the promise to be valid.</p>",

Taking the fight to the streets in his Yellow and purple costume The Comedian became a great hero in the fight against the underworld crime lords. While many saw  the Comedian as a sociopath he saw himself as a \"patriot\".</p><p>He joined the <a href=\"/minutemen/4060-55987/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55987\">Minute-Men</a> and on the day of their announcement, he attempted to rape the first Silk Spectre but was soon stopped by <a href=\"/hooded-justice/4005-44796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44796\">Hooded Justice</a>, who broke his nose. Laughing, The Comedian asked if this is what the <a href=\"/hooded-justice/4005-44796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44796\">Hooded Justice</a> was into, beating on people and causing them pain. Everything was almost a joke to him, he never even took the attempted rape seriously. The rape was covered up and the <a href=\"/minutemen/4060-55987/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55987\">Minute-Men</a> continued, but all his team mates, especially Nite Owl, grew to resent his presence on the team as they realised he was just as evil as the criminals they fought. Some time later Blake would be voted out of the group and he went about joining the military Some years later, Blake and the Silk Spectre were involved in a sexual relationship. The original <a href=\"/silk-spectre/4005-44239/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44239\">Spectre</a> said Blake had changed, but yet she still pulled away from him, when she discovered she was pregnant with his child and married into a normal life. He is the father of the second <a href=\"/silk-spectre/4005-44239/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44239\">Silk Spectre</a>, who Blake would meet when the Watchmen tried to form, After mocking them and explaining that they would never solve the worlds problems, he was met outside by the second <a href=\"/silk-spectre/4005-44239/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44239\">Silk Spectre</a> who shared a smoke with him, only to be interrupted by her mother who tears her away from the man and ask what type of monster he was, his reply was slow and gave a hint to who he really was to the girl.</p><h3>Service</h3><p>The Comedian served during World War II in the Pacific Theater. He became a covert government operative in the 1960's and it was during that time Blake was invited to join the superhero team known as <a href=\"/the-crimebusters/4060-46361/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46361\">The Crimebusters</a>, whom he turned down on grounds that their methods were obsolete. It was shown in Before Watchmen that the Comedian was friends with both John and Robert Kennedy and held high respect for them and was involved in killing Marilyn Monroe in order to protect the president. Later however, after they parted ways and Senator Kennedy wanted to go public with a masacure that Blake commited in Vietnam he helped with the assasination of Robert Kennedy.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/216256-103457-the-comedian.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216256\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.44\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/216256-103457-the-comedian.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216256\"><img alt=\"The Comedian at war\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/216256-103457-the-comedian.JPG\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/216256-103457-the-comedian.JPG 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-width=\"444\"></a><figcaption>The Comedian at war</figcaption></figure><p>The comedian went to fight in the <a href=\"/vietnam-war/4015-56024/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56024\">Vietnam Conflict</a> alongside <a href=\"/dr-manhattan/4005-40527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40527\">Dr. Manhattan</a> and was instrumental in winning the war for the USA. While serving there, like many G.I.'s he became involved with a young Vietnamese woman, As the celebration broke out after Dr. Manhattan put an end to the war, We find The Comedian sitting in a bar along with Manhattan. The woman enters heavily pregnant and ask Blake what he is going to do, He tells her he will leave her country and forget all about it. Breaking a glass she cuts his face, something to remember her by, pulling out his gun he shoots her dead and leaves but not before telling <a href=\"/dr-manhattan/4005-40527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40527\">Dr.Manhattan</a> that he is forgetting what it was to be human, he could have saved that women if he wanted.</p><p>After the passing of the mask-banning Keene Act in the 1970's, the Comedian continued his government employment along with Dr. Manhattan. The two of them and Ozymandias being the only publicly recognized and accepted superheroes.</p><h3>Death</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/203339-50959-the-comedian.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203339\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.7875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/203339-50959-the-comedian.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203339\"><img alt=\"The Death Of A Super Hero\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/203339-50959-the-comedian.JPG\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/203339-50959-the-comedian.JPG 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Death Of A Super Hero\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/203339-50959-the-comedian.JPG\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4456/203339-50959-the-comedian.JPG 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Death Of A Super Hero</figcaption></figure><p>In 1985, while on mission traveling by plane, Blake saw a mysterious island where he found multiple missing scientists and artists who were working for <a href=\"/ozymandias/4005-43221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43221\">Ozymandias</a>. Edward found out that they were planning on making a new species. All so <a href=\"/ozymandias/4005-43221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43221\">Ozymandias</a> could fake an alien invasion, all the nations governments would unite to fight this threat and the world would be in peace. The Comedian, torn with what to do, sought out the only person he could talk to about the horrible event, his former nemesis Moloch, now known as Edgar Jacobi. While drunk Blake broke into his house and told him he had no one to turn to and gave him a few key facts that the villain would not understand, but another hero would. Breaking down, The Comedian cried as he told Jacobi how sad and overwhelmed with guilt he was about what he had done to people over the years. Jacobi was the only person he could talk to and would be the last man to see him alive. The next night Comedian sat in his apartment watching T.V., His door shattered into pieces as Ozymandias broke in and attacked him. Blake was severely beaten, but tried to put up a good fight. Sadly it was not enough and he was thrown out of the window of his apartment to his death. Only the Watchmen and Jacobi who hid in the shadows attend The Comedian's funeral. Edward Morgan Blake died at the age of sixty one, But his death triggers the events of the Watchmen storyline.</p><h3>Costumes and Equipment</h3><p>Blake wore a boiler suit based costume in his early years. It was colored Yellow and Purple. As his worldview became darker, his second suit featured a more tactical look. It bore a pauldron with a single star on it, symbolising both his disilusionment and his love of the American dream, and the smiley face badge beneath his left shoulder. On the left shoulder itself, part of the US flag is worn. The suit is completed with either a ski or domino mask.</p><p>Blake used an M1911 for most of his career.

It was an iconic symbol. The smiley face covered in a splash of blood seemed to sum up the comic perfectly, with its take on the world and it’s politics, It is unknown if this is what the creators where going for but it seems to have grown into something fans can wonder over. It also seems to reflect The Comedians personality even better, his twisted out look on life, mixed with the blood and pain he deals out. It is a symbol known by almost all comic fans round the world.</p><h2>Iconic Quotes From The Comedian</h2><p><b><u>Doctor Manhattan Speaking to The Comedian about the Vietnam war.</u></b></p><p><b>Doctor Manhattan</b>: You sound bitter. You're a strange man, Blake. You have strange attitudes to life and war.</p><p><b>The Comedian</b>: Strange? Listen... once you figure out what a joke everything is, being the Comedian's the only thing that makes sense.</p><p><b>Doctor Manhattan:</b> The charred villages, the boys with necklaces of human ears... these are part of the joke?</p><p><b>The Comedian</b>: Hey... I never said it was a good joke! I'm just playing along with the gag...</p><p><u><b>Nite Owl speaking to the Comedian as they deal with a riot.</b></u></p><p><b>Nite Owl:</b> But the country's disintegrating. What's happened to America? What's happened to the American dream?.<b>The Comedian</b>: <i>(holding a Shot gun)</i> It came true. You're lookin' at it. Now c'mon... let's really put these jokers through some changes.</p><p><b><u>First Meeting of the Watchmen/Crimebusters</u></b></p><p><b>Ozymandias:</b> It doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems.</p><p><b>The Comedian</b>: No, but it takes a room full of morons to think they're small enough for them to handle.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Nibbler appears mostly on Fox's Futurama. He is a Nibblonian that was found on the collapsing planet, <b>Vergon 6</b>. We know him as Nibbler, but his true name would take the average human eternities to pronounce. He is actually from planet <b>Nibblonia</b>, not Vergon 6; a world with several dimensions of existence incomprehensible to the human mind.</p><p>Upon finding Nibbler, Leela and crew had captured two of every animal on Vergon 6. They stored Nibbler (who is relatively small) in with the other animals, hoping he would survive. When the last animal was captured, the crew opened the door to find the room empty, except for Nibbler. They placed the other animal next to him, and he consumed them all. His stomach has some mysterious ability to compact the animals as he eats much and even poops <b>\"dark matter\".</b></p><p>Dark matter is an extremely dense substance, 'each pound of which weighs over 10,000 pounds'. This poop is used to fuel <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43971\" href=\"/planet-express/4060-43971/\">Planet Express</a>'s space ship.</p><p>Nibbler also has a range of other abilities. He is really an intelligent being who is capable of speech and operating complex machinery, like his space ship. He can cause memory loss by emitting a bright flash from his third eye. This causes a strange sensation, and appears to make the victim lose any memory Nibbler chooses.</p><h2>Time Paradox</h2><p>Nibbler was the one who pushed Fry into the cryogenic chamber. He did this because Fry was the only person in the universe who could withstand the Brainspawn, because of his lack of the <i>Delta Brain Wave</i>. Fry travels back in time to stop Nibbler from pushing him into the chamber. Nibbler convinces Fry to push himself into the Future. Afterwards, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59464\" href=\"/cupid/4005-59464/\">Nibbler</a> helps Fry to gain the love of Leela, by giving him a beautiful flower.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Wulfgar spent five years in the forges under Bruenor. There he learned to craft the mightiest weapons and became close friends with the dwarves there. He also started forming a bond with Catti-bri Bruenors human adopted daughter.</p><p>Near the end of his years there Bruenor brought him a gift. A large warhammer he crafted and enchanted himself called Aegis-Fang. Wulfgar was like a son to Bruenor and was sad to see his time coming to an end with his people.</p><p>Bruenor wanting Wulfgar to learn to fight like a real warrior and not just a brute barbarian brought himto his new teacher. Wulfgar was insulted at first, thinking what could a skinny elf teach him about fighting that he already did not know. It did not take long for Drizzt to show his error, and the two became close friends in thier training togather.</p><p>One night on patrol the came across a blood spotted camp and searched about. They found the bodies of dead dwarves and track of giants. Wulfgar set out to warn Bruenor, while Drizzt followed thier tracks. When Wulfgar returned he and Drizzt would strike revenge against the giants. The entered the cave lair to the giants and fought them valiantly. Biggrin and his giants were dead, and the fallen dwarves avenged.</p><p>As war started the brew once more between the people of Ten Towns and the Barbarians Wulfgar set out on a journey to help solve the situation. Unknown to him he was followed by Drizzt to the lair of the Might Iceingdeath, a white wyrm dragon. There Drizzt and Wulfgar battled the dragon until Wulfgar killed it by causeing a icey stalagtite to drop and pirce its body. The dragon dead Wulfgar took its head and went back to his people.</p><p>Arriveing back to his tribe Wulfgar challenged Heafstaag for leadership to the tribe. Heafstaag was refuseing to fight at first saying that Wulfgar had done nothing to prove his right of challenge. That was when he showed them the head of the dragon that he had slain. With the proof needed the two brabarians fought for leadership. With the training taught to him by Drizzt Wulfgar easily avoided Heafstaag's attacks. He called Wulfgar a coward and told him to fight him, and so Wulfgar did. He beat Heafstaag by grabbing his head and squizing his skull, crushing his head with Wulfgars mighty strength.</p><p>Wulfgar would then lead his people to help the Ten Towns fight off Akar Kessel and his goblin army. With Wulfgar as the new Clan leader there was fianlly peace between the Ten Towns and the Tribes of the frozen tundra. But Wulfgar would not stay long as he set out with Drizzt, Bruenor, and Regis in search for Mithral Hall. On the road with them Wulfgar soon learned about life outside of Icewind Dale.</p><p>In the search of Mithral Hall Wulfgar grew up. He realized how little he knew of the world. In Luskan he had gotten into a bar fight with the local thugs, which ended up with Reigs and Wulfgar being kicked out. But the Companions soon jumped the wall and headed for Longsaddle. Another place Wulfgar felt uneased at. There was too much sorcery for his liking. But soon realized that it was not evil like he was lead to believe.</p><p>From there they headed to Silverymoon, then Heralds Holdfast, and then finally Mithral Hall. Inside the Hall Wulfgar was faced off againt Bok. The Golem that had accomponied Artemis, Sydney, and Jierldan to find the companions. With his massive strength Wulfgar ripped of the Golems head and used his magical hammer Aegis-fang to strike him down and over the gorge.</p><p>With Buenor lost to the shadow dragon Shimmergloom, and thier friend Regis to the assassin it was time to leave Mithral Hall. Wulfgar, Drizzt, and Catti-brie set out for Longsaddle where they would make plans. Catti-brie would mass an army to retake Mithral Hall and avenge Buenor, while Drizzt and Wulfgar went to rescue Regis from the dangerous assassin Artemis Entreri.</p><p>Upon departing from Longsaddle Catti-brie stopped Wulfagar and gave him a long passionate kiss.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>A single mother with unique abilities, Abigail Dunton found a place for herself in Damage Control, a search and rescue team formed during the Hulk's rampage in World War Hulk. Using the code-name, \"Visioneer\", she uses what she deems to be \"limited\" psychic abilities to sense survivors in need of help trapped under the rubble.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Creation</h2><p>Visioneer was created by Robert Kirkman and Cory Walker and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-irredeemable-ant-man-7-uninvited/4000-108792/\">The irredeemable Ant-Man issue 7</a> (2007).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Enter Ant-Man</h3><p>Visioneer's world is turned upside down when she meets Ant-Man, <a href=\"../../eric-ogrady/29-6774/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Eric O'Grady</a> (then mascarading under the alias Slaying Mantis, Derek Sullivan). The two are smitten by each other's abrasive personalities and genuinely hit it off. Things seem to be going relatively well until Abigail reveals she has a young son from a previous relationship. Eric is upset and leaves her in an emotional tantrum.</p><p>After Eric realizes he is going to be put in the Avengers Initiative, he returns one last time to Abigail's home to tell her he'll be going away, but wishes for them to continue their relationship whenever he returns. Abigail is initially tentative, but amicably wishes Eric luck and admits she still loves him.</p><p> </p><h2>Personality and Powers</h2><p>Visioneer possesses a sarcastic and somewhat abrasive personality. She does not hesitate to speak her mind, and often does questionable acts simply as a matter of principle (such as stealing a tip left for a waitress who gave her bad service at a diner).</p><p>Visioneer is very self-depricating about her telepathic powers, calling them \"stupid\" or not even referring to them as a power. This makes it difficult to determine how powerful she actually is, though it seems her powers are more based upon emotion than actually being able to read thoughts, as she senses those under great stress or agitation with greater frequency.</p>",

He began hiding his insecurities behind a mischievous,comic relief attitude. As the series begins, he is seen painting on the statues of the most respected characters in the Naruto world, the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hokage/4060-50942/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50942\">Hokage</a>. He is quickly apprehended by his teacher, <a href=\"/iruka-umino/4005-48969/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48969\">Iruka Umino</a>, and taken to the Ninja academy, where he and the rest of his class are told to practice their transformation <a href=\"/jutsu/4015-50943/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50943\">jutsu</a>.

Iruka Umino after watching Naruto work, offers him ramen (Naruto’s favorite food), and Naruto asks to wear Iruka’s headband, but Iruka refuses, saying that it is only for those who graduate the academy, and that Naruto must earn it. The next day, the academy graduation test is a doppelgänger test. Naruto complains that he is horrible at the doppelganger, and he proves it true when he creates a dumb and drooling illusion, when he was supposed to create three good doppelgangers. Even after the prompting of the other teacher, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mizuki/4005-90820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90820\">Mizuki</a>, Naruto is failed for the third year in a row. Naruto sits on a swing as everyone else goes up and celebrates their graduation with there parents.</p><p>As Naruto sat, brooding over his third failing, Mizuki approaches him and tells him about his similarities between him and Iruka, and then tells him that something that could make him exponentially more powerful is the forbidden scroll. Naruto Proceeds to steal it, disabling <a href=\"/the-third-hokage/4005-44513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44513\">The Third Hokage</a> with the Sexy jutsu. Naruto then flees into the woods and begins to memorize the scroll. He is only able to learn the first technique on the scroll before being discovered by Iruka. As Iruka prepares to take Naruto back to the village, he is attacked by Mizuki. Mizuki then proceeds to tell Naruto about his role as Kyuubi, and as he prepares to deal Naruto a final blow, Iruka gets in the way and is seriously injured. Naruto then runs from Iruka after Mizuki tells him that Iruka hates him for orphaning him (Even though Naruto was not Kyuubi, but was only his vessel. Mizuki left out this part). Iruka then pretends to be Naruto, and as Naruto, leads Mizuki on a wild goose chase, before attacking him. Naruto sit close by as Iruka gives a speech about how he does not hate Naruto, only Kyuubi. As Mizuki gets ready to kill Iruka, Naruto kicks him. He then shows the one move he was able to memorize from the scroll, the Doppelganger (which, you can call it the multi-shadow clone jutsu, instead of just making illusionary Narutos, he actually makes duplicates of himself.) Naruto then proceeds to pummel Mizuki, and Iruka gives him his headband, saying that Naruto has officially graduated from the academy.</p><p>The next day, Naruto is taking a picture for his profiling in the ninja bingo book. He does a very over the top look, making himself appear very threatening, with face paint, and everything.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-334155\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/334155-88471-konohamaru.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.008547008547\" data-width=\"351\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 351px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/334155-88471-konohamaru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-334155\"><img alt=\"Konohamaru and his \"crew\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/334155-88471-konohamaru.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/334155-88471-konohamaru.jpg 351w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/334155-88471-konohamaru.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Konohamaru and his \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Konohamaru and his \"crew\"</figcaption></figure><p>After he tries to submit the picture, it is denied, but before he can complain, a strange boy jumps into the room, attempting to attack the Third Hokage. He trips over his own scarf though, and falls onto his face. His teacher then enters the room, and tells the boy (who he calls <a href=\"/konohamaru-sarutobi/4005-50189/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50189\">Konohamaru</a>) not to attack his esteemed grandfather. Konohamaru ignores the man, and begins blaming Naruto for stopping him from attacking his grandfather (which Naruto did not do). Naruto then gets into an argument with the boy, which ends with the boy getting a smack in the face. Konohamaru’s teacher, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ebisu/4005-90623/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90623\">Ebisu</a>, goes ballistic, saying that this demon boy should not even have the authority to touch the Third Hokage’s esteemed Grandson.</p><p>After the incident, Konohamaru begins to stalk Naruto, and when Naruto confronts him about it, he asks to learn the Sexy Jutsu from Naruto. Naruto accepts, and he and Konohamaru begin training. Konohamaru is seen doing a very fat version of the Sexy Jutsu, and is scolded by Naruto. Later, when both of them are taking a break, Naruto asks Konohamaru why he is so obsessed with taking down his grandfather. It turns out that Konohamaru is tired of only being acknowledged as the Third Hokage's grandson, and wants to be known as something more. Naruto then says that if Konohamaru wants to be the Hokage, he has to get through Naruto. He then ends their teaching, saying that from now on, they are rivals. Ebisu then appears, and Konohamaru attempts to disable him with the \"Sexy Jutsu\", Ebisu says that he would never fall for such a vulgar move (though he is smiling when he says it). Naruto the combines his doppelganger with the \"Sexy-Jutsu\" and reveals his new technique, the \"Harem Jutsu\". Ebisu is sent limp, and Naruto and Konohamaru leave happily.</p><p>The next day, Naruto is sitting in the graduated class, and as a classmate continues to bother Naruto about being in the class, <a href=\"/sakura/4005-44242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44242\">Sakura</a> Haruno comes up to him and tells him to move so that she can sit next to <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\">Sasuke</a> Uchiha. Naruto then gets into a glaring conflict with Sasuke, and is accidentally pushed into Sasuke, where Naruto shares his first (yet accidental) kiss. All of Sasuke’s fan girls then proceed to beat up Naruto. After Naruto's beating, Iruka assigns them to three man cells. Naruto is, not to surprisingly, paired with Sakura and Sasuke. At lunch time, Naruto ties up Sasuke and pretends to be him so that he can learn what Sakura thinks of him. He then insults her (as Sasuke), but as he walks down the hall, the real Sasuke meets him, telling him that he needs to work on his knots.</p><p>The next day, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are waiting for their new Jonin instructor. Naruto decides to pull a prank on him by putting an eraser on the door. Naruto laughs as <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> Hatake falls into the trap and is hit on the head by the eraser. He then responds by saying he hates them. The team then proceeds outside and tells about themselves. Naruto continuously talks about ramen until expressing his want to be the next Hokage. Kakashi then shows a bit of interest in Naruto’s interests before concluding the session. Sasuke tells them about how he wants to defeat a \"certain someone\", his brother, <a href=\"/itachi/4005-44260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44260\">Itachi</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-147887\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/147887-90744-sasuke.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/147887-90744-sasuke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-147887\"><img alt=\"Naruto's rival, Sasuke Uchiha\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/147887-90744-sasuke.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/147887-90744-sasuke.jpg 400w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/147887-90744-sasuke.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Naruto's rival, Sasuke Uchiha\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/147887-90744-sasuke.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/147887-90744-sasuke.jpg 400w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/147887-90744-sasuke.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Naruto's rival, Sasuke Uchiha</figcaption></figure><p>He tells them to meet at the training grounds the next day, and to not eat any breakfast, unless they like to throw up. When the three students arrive, they are left waiting for a few hours (again) before Kakashi arrives with two bells. He tells his students that they have to get the bells from him, or they don’t get any lunch (the reason for not eating breakfast). He then orders the children to attack as if to kill, and when Sakura says it would be dangerous, Kakashi calls Naruto a loser. Naruto takes offense and attempts to attack him, but Kakashi appears behind him and puts Naruto's weapon behind his head, holding him still. He then comments that they are listening to him and that he is starting to like them. Everyone then hides around Kakashi, but Naruto confronts him head on. He is quickly defeated, and sent flying into the water by Kakashi’s “Thousand Years of Death\" technique (poking his fingers up his butt). Naruto then uses his shadow clones to trap Kakashi once he gets out. As he does one final attack, Kakashi switches his body with one of Naruto’s shadow clones. Naruto then begins to attack the doppelganger, believing it to be a transformed Kakashi. Naruto then falls into one of Kakashi’s traps, and ends up hanging by his ankle from a tree. He escapes, but lands on another of Kakashi’s traps, and is hanging from his ankle yet again. During his time hanging upside-down, Naruto sees the bento on three logs. He escapes and attempts to eat the bento, but is caught by Kakashi and tied to one of the logs. Kakashi then tells them that he is not sending them back to the academy, but that they are so hopeless that they should give up trying to be ninjas.</p><p>After declaring the three ninjas hopeless, Kakashi reveals the point of the exercise, teamwork, and tells Sasuke and Sakura to eat the lunch in front of Naruto, because Naruto tried to eat without permission. He said if they feed him, they all fail. Kakashi leaves, and Sasuke offers some of his lunch to Naruto. Sakura then follows suit, and Kakashi (who was hiding behind a tree) charges at them but, at the last second, stops in front of them and declares their passing. The lunch eating was actually a test to see if they would share the lunch. He explains that “those who violate the rules are scum, but those who forget their friends are less them scum.” Naruto is touched by his words, and Kakashi declares that Team 7’s first mission shall begin the next day. Kakashi, Sasuke, and Sakura begin to leave, but they forget about Naruto, and he is left tied to the stump, or choose to leave him there.</p><p><a href=\"/team-7/4060-44283/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44283\">Team 7</a> is next seen following an unidentified figure. Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are then told to capture it, and Naruto pounces onto the figure. It is revealed that their target is the Fire Daimyo’s wife’s cat. After Team 7 returns for their pay, Naruto complains about their lack of excitement in their missions. After a bit of wearing down, the Hokage gives Naruto a C-rank mission. The mission is to guard a bridge builder named Tazuna. Soon after leaving the village, they are attacked by two ninjas. During the battle, Sasuke holds off the ninjas, but Naruto freezes and is cut by one of their claws.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127838\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127838-124302-kakashi.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.755\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127838-124302-kakashi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127838\"><img alt=\"Kakashi Hatake, Naruto's mentor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/127838-124302-kakashi.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127838-124302-kakashi.jpg 400w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/127838-124302-kakashi.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kakashi Hatake, Naruto's mentor\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/127838-124302-kakashi.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127838-124302-kakashi.jpg 400w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/127838-124302-kakashi.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kakashi Hatake, Naruto's mentor</figcaption></figure><p>After Kakashi subdues them, he looks at Naruto’s wound and says that the claw was poisoned. Naruto panics and Kakashi tells him that he has to bleed the wound to get the poison out. Naruto then stabs very deeply into the wound, vowing never to freeze up, and to protect the old man. Kakashi then tells him that, though he extracted the poison, he overdid it and could very possibly bleed to death. Naruto again panics, but, when Kakashi observes the wound, he discovers that the wound has already started to heal. He then tells Naruto that he will be fine. (This is a result of Kyuubi, the Nine Tailed Fox.)</p><p>Tazuna then reveals that he misled Team 7 with the mission parameters. He is truly being hunted by a billionaire named <a href=\"/gato/4005-44966/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44966\">Gato</a>, who makes his money by Marine transportation. The ninja's they just fought had been sent by Gato to assassinate him. Tazuna has in fact been on Gato's bad side because he is building a bridge to the mainland, which would allow non-marine transportation with the mainland. This in fact makes the mission an A-rank mission, instead of C-Rank. Tazuna had to trick them because he could not afford an A-rank Mission. Team 7 agrees to continue (reluctantly).</p><p>They then take a rowboat to the land of waves, and as they begin walking, Naruto attempts to outdo Sasuke, eventually stunning a rabbit with a projectile. Suddenly, Kakashi calls for everyone to duck, and Sakura pushes Naruto down as a rapidly spinning sword flies overhead and into a tree, and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/zabuza-momochi/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\">Zabuza Momochi</a> appears on it's hilt.</p><p>Naruto sees Zabuza as a chance to prove himself, and he attempts to attack Zabuza, but Kakashi holds him back. He tells Naruto that Zabuza is way out of his league, and proceeds to reveal his <a href=\"/sharingan/4055-44263/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44263\">Sharingan</a> eye.</p><p>As the fight between Zabuza and Kakashi rages on, Team 7 realizes that they may be in a more dangerous spot then they had predicted. With the three of them in a formation they attempted to protect Tazuna.</p><p>During the bout, Zabuza sent out a \"Water Clone\" jutsu to kill Tazuna. Naruto and Sasuke's quick thinking barely saved them. Naruto barraged the psychotic killer with all his might and \"Shadow Clones\", while Sasuke devised a deadly plan. With Kakashi captured, all that the three could do was hope that they could save him with this plan or else they were dead meat. No one had any clue at how dangerous Zabuza really was, though. He captured Kakashi with his \"Water Prison\" jutsu and proceeded to make him sedentary during the fight. With Sasuke's plan, however, they managed to get him out of the prison and thus turn the tides of the battle. Sasuke launched two demon wind shuriken ( was Naruto) and Zabuza dodged them both as Naruto freed Kakashi they managed to win but Zabuza got away with <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/haku/4005-44244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44244\">Haku's</a> help. Later they confronted Zabuza on a bridge. Kakashi fought Zabuza and Naruto and Sasuke barely managed to fend off Zabuza as soon he was killed himself, his partner Haku, and Gato all at once.</p><h2>Chunin exams</h2><p>The first test of the Chunin exams was an actual test. The point was to cheat on every answer without getting caught. Naruto had a hard time deciding whether or not to stay because for the last question if he got it wrong his whole team would fail and never get a second chance at the Chunin exams. He decide to stay and it's later shown he didn't answer a single question. Everyone who decided to stay passed. During the second part of the test every team had to retrieve one scroll from another team within the Forest of Death. They had to have a Earth and Heaven scroll to pass, but they couldn't read them. In the forest they ran into and had to fight <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a>, one of the three legendary <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sannin/4060-45212/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45212\">Sannin</a>. They survived but with a seal on Sasuke which gave him increased powers at a price. He also tried to seal Naruto's fox inside him with the five pronged seal.</p><p>During the last part of the second test Naruto and Sakura decided to fake one of the scrolls. They were going to try and figure out what was in the other scroll by reading the scroll they had. Luckily, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kabuto-yakushi/4005-44523/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44523\">Kabuto Yakushi</a> managed to stop them. Then Sasuke came back and was disappointed. Kabuto then decided to help out Naruto and his team. He told them about how to get the other scroll. After a fight of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rain-village-ninja/4060-59908/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59908\">Rain ninja</a> they made it to the tower where they would take the next part of there test.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652289\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png\" data-ratio=\"0.7495183044316\" data-width=\"519\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 519px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652289\"><img alt=\"Naruto Fighting Kiba\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png 519w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Naruto Fighting Kiba\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png 519w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652289-519px_kiba_vs_naruto.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Naruto Fighting Kiba</figcaption></figure><p>After that the preliminary test started, which consisted of a tournament. When it was Naruto's turn to fight he had to face <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kiba-inuzuka/4005-44279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44279\">Kiba Inuzuka</a>. Even though Kiba thought it was going to be easy he was wrong and it proved very difficult. With help from a fart which stunned Kiba, Naruto, with the help of \"Shadow Clones\" used a new technique that he called the \" Naruto Uzumaki Barrage\" (a blatant rip off of Sasuke's \"Lion's Barrage\", to seem cool in front of Sakura) and won the match. When <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hinata-hyuga/4005-44280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44280\">Hinata Hyuga</a> had to fight her cousin <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/neji-hyuga/4005-44526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44526\">Neji</a>, Naruto encourages and helps her telling her about what Neji said about her being weak and useless and not deserving to be in the main branch not true. Nonetheless she failed.</p><h2>Before Part II of the Chunin Exams</h2><p>Before the finals each ninja has one month to train and heal for their match. Naruto gets stuck with Ebisu as a trainer and attempts to get out of it in any possible way, but Kakashi says that he is too busy teaching Sasuke, and, him being the only one that would ever teach Naruto in <a href=\"/konohagakure/4020-45367/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45367\">Konoha</a>, he was stuck with Ebisu. For Ebisu's first training exercise, Naruto and he would head over to a spa, in order to learn how to finally control his <a href=\"/chakra/4015-46239/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46239\">chakra</a> enough to walk on water.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-337873\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337873-95019-jiraiya.JPG\" data-ratio=\"1.0825\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337873-95019-jiraiya.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-337873\"><img alt=\"Jiraiya's here!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/337873-95019-jiraiya.JPG\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337873-95019-jiraiya.JPG 400w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/337873-95019-jiraiya.JPG 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jiraiya's here!\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/337873-95019-jiraiya.JPG\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337873-95019-jiraiya.JPG 400w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/337873-95019-jiraiya.JPG 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jiraiya's here!</figcaption></figure><p>As an incentive, the water below him would be boiling hot, meaning that he would almost have to be able to stand on it in order to even make it out of here alive. Needless to say, Ebisu was forced to catch Naruto multiple times before he finally almost semi halfway sort of got the concept, of walking on water, before he saw a large man staring into the women's bath through a tiny hole in the wall on the other side of the room. Seeing this, Ebisu flew into a rage and told the man that that kind of thing was not permissible in his training session, and that he would have to leave. Charging the man with a kunai, he was quickly defeated as the man turned around, barely even noticing him, the giant frog he was standing on doing all the work for him. Seeing that this guy was tons and tons stronger than Ebisu, the pathetically perverted instructor, he asked for this new man to train him. He begged and begged, only to have him tell him that he was far to busy to deal with a little brat like him, and had more of his so defined \"research\" to do.</p><p>He finally says yes, after Naruto did his \"Sexy Jutsu\", on one condition, being that he had to stay in that form the whole time they were training together. Naruto screamed no, and transformed back, but the old perverted man, who introduced himself as the great \"Toad Sage Jiraiya\" , he told him that he was no ordinary pervert, that he was a \"Mega-Perv\", and that Naruto should just leave him alone. Eventually after begging, Jiraiya trained the young aspiring Hokage, and told him a lot of things about chakra that Ebisu had never even seemed to touch on. After Naruto had gotten as close to nailing water walking as Jiraiya thought he could for the day, he asked Naruto to use up every last bit of his chakra, and so he did, by beating himself up for the entire day with his own shadow clones. They did this for many days, and Naruto often pondered the purpose of such things, but Jiraiya only told him that he needed to expend his chakra every day for him to see something..one day, Naruto's shirt was ripped off, and he noticed something about the seal on Naruto's stomach...the even numbered seal had been covered by an odd numbered one, making it near impossible for Naruto to manipulate his chakra. It was a wonder he could do nearly anything at all, but once Jiraiya released the seal, he was fine. And, now that Naruto was fully capable of walking on water, he decided he would train him in another very special art...the art of summoning, one of the most powerful jutsu to be spawned.</p><h2>Chunin Exams continued</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652288\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png\" data-ratio=\"0.7495183044316\" data-width=\"519\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 519px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652288\"><img alt=\"Naruto vs Neji\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png 519w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Naruto vs Neji\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png 519w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652288-519px_neji_s_fight_with_naruto.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Naruto vs Neji</figcaption></figure><p>In the finals, Naruto's opponent was Neji and was the first fight in the tournament. The perfect match, as he was insanely angry at him and so he would be fueled by what Neji had done to Hinata. Despite what Neji said that everybody's destiny is sealed, Naruto managed to beat him by using his Nine-Tails' chakra and tricking him, which opens Neji's eyes telling destiny isn't always sealed in stone.</p><p>When Sasuke's match comes by everyone falls asleep because of genjutsu from secret <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sand-village-ninja/4060-59903/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59903\">Sand ninja</a> in the stands. Kakashi, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/might-guy/4005-48904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48904\">Might Guy</a>, and Sakura use \"Chakra release\" to protect themselves from it. Kakashi then tells Sakura to wake-up Naruto and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/shikamaru-nara/4005-44247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44247\">Shikamaru Nara</a> in order to chase after Sasuke to prevent him from doing anything rash. Sakura finds out that Shikamaru cleared the genjutsu too. They then are assigned to go after Sasuke and help him out with the help of a ninja-dog. Shikamaru tells them to go ahead so he can fend off a group of sound ninja that are coming after them.</p><p>When they get there <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\">Gaara</a> sticks Sakura to a tree after fighting Sasuke. Naruto then jumps in to save Sasuke from Gaara. After a few minutes Gaara changes into his true form, the One Tailed <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/shukaku/4005-50160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50160\">Shukaku</a>. Naruto tries to summon Chief Toad but it's not the chief toad, it's <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gamakichi/4005-59042/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59042\">Gamakichi</a>. Then after another attempt he finally summons the chief toad <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gamabunta/4005-49330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49330\">Gamabunta</a>. Chief Toad uses his sword to fight the Shukaku but needs to hold him down. Naruto transforms them into the Nine Tailed Fox! Toad grabs onto Shukaku and Naruto jumps on him and fights Gaara. After they both disappear, Naruto hits Gaara and after they battle a few more seconds they're both to tired too continue fighting.</p><h2><b>Search for Tsunade</b></h2><p>Naruto is now traveling with Jiraiya to find <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fifth-hokage/4005-44512/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44512\">Tsunade</a>, the last member of the Sannin, so they can offer her the role of Fifth Hokage. During that time Jiraiya teaches Naruto the \"Rasengan\", the justu that the Fouth Hokage created. Later Jiraiya and Naruto find Tsunade with her student <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/shizune/4005-50174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50174\">Shizune</a>.</p><p>Tsunade started to insult the Hokage which infuriated Naruto and he challenged her to a fight. She stoppped Naruto with one finger in which she makes a bet to Naruto if he master the \"Rasengan\" in one week she will give him her \"cursed\" <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/first-hokages-necklace/4055-57462/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57462\">necklace</a>. Nearing the deadline Naruto still has not mastered the \"Rasengan\", but he later learns of Tsunade's meeting with Orochimaru and aimed to stop it. He then masters the \"Rasengan\" when fighting Kabuto, and he passed out through effort afterwards and injury. Tsunade gave him the necklace as she healed him.</p><h2><b>Sasuke Retrieval</b></h2><p>When Shikamaru is assigned to retrieve Sasuke from the Sound Four, Tsunade says he must bring Naruto with him. Along with hime, Neji, Choji, and Kiba and Akamaru are brought. When they find the Sound Four they become trapped with a rock prison by Jirobou. Thanks to Shikamaru's instruction, Choji was able to get them out using his Human Boulder technique. They then leave Choji to fight Jirobu so they can rescue Sasuke.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1775526\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1775526-300px_shikateam.png\" data-ratio=\"0.75333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1775526-300px_shikateam.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1775526\"><img alt=\"Sasuke Retrieval Team\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1775526-300px_shikateam.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1775526-300px_shikateam.png 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sasuke Retrieval Team\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1775526-300px_shikateam.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1775526-300px_shikateam.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sasuke Retrieval Team</figcaption></figure><p>When Shikamaru fails to act like Jirobou to get Sasuke, Kidomauru stays behind while the other two go on. Each person tries to do a sneak attack on Kidomaru, he traps Naruto and his shadow clones and everyone else with his web. Kidomaru decides to shoot at each Shadow Clone until he finds the real Naruto. He fails to shoot the real one leaving two clones left. He shoots at both but they disapear. Naruto comes behind and attacks Kidomaru. This allows Neji to free himself and others. They leave Neji to fight Kidomaru and his six arms so they can go after the other two of the Sound Four.</p><p>As they were running Naruto was able to get Sasuke and Akamaru set bombs along the way. When Sakon of the Sound Four gets hit by a bomb he starts chasing Akamaru and wraps him in string. Kiba goes after him as a bomb explodes and Sakon, Akamaru, and Kiba fall down into a canyon. When Tayuya catches up a new ninja appears and grabs Sasuke' coffin. His name is Kimimaro and he reveals himself to be a fifth member of the Sound Ninja Four, now the Sound Ninja Five. Kimimaro then leaves with Naruto going after him. After Naruto finally caught up with <a href=\"/kimimaro/4005-44262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44262\">Kimimaro</a>, he began fighting him with all of his strength. he even used multiple Shadow Clone <a href=\"/jutsu/4015-50943/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50943\">Jutsu</a> in <a href=\"/kyuubi/4005-46398/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46398\">Kyuubi</a> form, and still didn't manage to beat the man who fought with bones. In the middle of the fight, Naruto saw <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\">Sasuke</a> come out of the strange box seal that he'd been in since Naruto had come after him. Naruto commenced to ask <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\">Sasuke</a> what on earth he was doing, and was only replied with a maniacal cackle. He began to pursue <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\">Sasuke</a> as he leapt off into the forest behind <a href=\"/kimimaro/4005-44262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44262\">Kimimaro</a> and started heading towards <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a>'s lair, or at least where he thought he resided.

Rock Lee held off Kimimaro while Naruto would pursue Sasuke once again. Naruto then fights Sasuke with all his might even using the nine-tailed foxs power but Sasuke's curse mark eventually beats him. Then Kakashi goes out and brings Naruto and the others to the hospital.

Later Kakashi makes them take the bell test again. This time the objective is to actually get the bells since there are only two people since Sasuke left to train with Orochimaru. Kakashi uses his Sharingan this time knowing he's in for a fight.</p><p>Naruto and Sakura think of a plan to defeat Kakashi without putting fourth alot more effort after he manages to get a few hits. Naruto thinks of a good plan then they go at Kakashi. While heading straight for Naruto and Sakura Kakashi prepares to attack but Naruto yells out he knows the ending to one of Kakashi's Icha Icha (Makeout Makeout) series. Kakashi covers his ears but since has the Sharingan he can read Naruto's lips. So he closes his eyes and when he opens them Naruto and Sakura are standing over him with the 2 bells. Naruto then says he didn't even know the ending after getting bored of reading the book and both of them pass.</p><p>Naruto goes off to help retrieve Gaara whom was captured by Akatsuki, journeying with him is Kakashi, Sakura, and a Sand village ninja named <a href=\"/chiyo/4005-45015/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45015\">Chiyo</a> whom is related to one of the Akatsuki that captured Gaara. As they close in upon Gaara's assailants, they are halted by Itachi. Itachi successfully places Naruto in a genjutsu, but is able to escape with the help of Sakura and Chiyo. Kakashi and Itachi begin fighting and Kakashi manages to trap Itachi, allowing Naruto to end the fight with the Big Ball Rasengan. However, it turned out to be a fake Itachi that the real Itachi was controlling from somewhere else.</p><p>After catching up to Akatsuki, he would then leave Sakura and Chiyo to deal with <a href=\"/sasori/4005-44999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44999\">Sasori</a> to give chase after <a href=\"/deidara/4005-44957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44957\">Deidara</a> and Gaara with Kakashi. Naruto is unable to reach Deidara's height, however Kakashi uses his new Mangekyou Sharingan technique, Kamui, to try kill Deidara, but only manages to pull off his arm. Naruto manages to attack the fallen Deidara head on, however it turns out to be an Earth Clone and Naruto begins to sprout tails in anger. Kakashi quickly acts, using a seal Jiraiya gave him to suppress the Kyuubi's chakra. Gai and his squad show up to help capture Deidara, however he manages to escape in an explosion which Kakashi uses his Kamui technique to protect everyone. They then meet up with Sakura and Chiyo with Gaara's body, and Chiyo uses a technique with Naruto's help to revive the deceased Gaara, however it cost Chiyo her life and Naruto mourned. Gaara, Kankuro, and Temari thank Naruto and his friends and Gaara says that he once again owes Naruto.</p><p>Because Kakashi expelled too much of his chakra, he was forced to recover in the hospital. During this time Naruto goes to meet some of his other friends and is attacked by a mysterious new guy, however he quickly leaves after the skirmish. Naruto and Sakura are later introduced to their temporary team captain, <a href=\"/yamato/4005-44245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44245\">Yamato</a>, and they are also introduced to Sasuke's replacement, the one that attacked Naruto and his friends earlier. His name is Sai, and he says that he was just seeing what Naruto was capable of. The apathetic Sai however quickly gets on Naruto's and Sakura's bad sides due to his ignorance of simple human emotion, forcing Yamato to play peace-keeper.</p><p>They set out on a mission, that mission is to meet with Sasori's spy that has information on Orochimaru. But before that, Yamato goes over details with Sakura and has Naruto, Sai, and Sakura try to work as a team to capture him. Naruto uses a clever trick by transforming his Shadow Clone to look like Sai while the real Sai flanks Yamato, however Naruto accidentally gives away the ruse by using his Shadow Clone to help make the Rasengan and Yamato escapes after binding Naruto, Sai then leaves them and manages to capture Yamato on his own, infuriating Naruto that he didn't come to his aid.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652285\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png\" data-ratio=\"0.7495183044316\" data-width=\"519\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 519px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652285\"><img alt=\"The new Team Kakashi\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 519w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The new Team Kakashi\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 519w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The new Team Kakashi</figcaption></figure><p>The team then meets with Sasori's spy, Sakura, Naruto, and Sai hide at a distance while Yamato approaches the spy disguised as Sasori. The spy turns out to be Kabuto, and the meeting turns out to be an ambush in order to kill Sasori. Yamato and his teammates quickly leap into action and Naruto attacks Orochimaru in his 3-tailed form, and quickly sprouts a 4th tail in responce to Orochimaru's goading and completely loses control of himself. Orochimaru seemed to be having fun though, practically skipping around Naruto's attacks. Orochimaru attacks Naruto head-on, however Naruto manages to cut Orochimaru in half... but he reattaches himself and continues to fight. Naruto then attacks Orochimaru with a gigantic chakra blast which Orochimaru attempts to shield himself from. The blast appeared to leave Orochimaru crippled some distance away, however Orochimaru appears beneath Naruto and attacks him with the Kusanagi, sending Naruto flying back near his comrades. Orochimaru's body starts to reject him so he begins to leave, however he's stopped by Sai whom has orders to ally with Orochimaru. As this is going on, Naruto attacks Sakura whom gets too close to him and Yamato uses his ability to suppress the Kyuubi in Naruto. Kabuto then heals Sakura and leaves.</p><p>Naruto, Sakura, and Yamato give chase after Sai, Kabuto, and Orochimaru. They come to Orochimaru's hideout and find Sai whom was kept locked in a spare room until Orochimaru felt he could be trusted. Kabuto comes to Sai's aid, believing him to be have been captured, but Sai subdues him and decides to help Naruto find Sasuke. They all split up and Sai finds Sasuke first... it turns out his real mission is to kill Sasuke. Their ensuing fight alerts the others and they quickly come to Sai's aid. They find out Sai was supposed to kill Sasuke, but he insists that he decided not to go through with his orders. Sasuke lunges after Naruto and suppresses the Kyuubi's chakra, he then goes to stab Naruto but is saved by Sai. Sakura goes to attack Sasuke, but is knocked out of the way by Yamato whom attempts to stop Sasuke's sword strike, but the sword cuts through Yamato's kunai and stabs him in the shoulder. Yamato uses his Mokuton to force the blade out of himself and Sasuke uses Chidori Current to zap all of them and retreats to higher ground. Yamato tells Sakura and Naruto that he didn't want to hurt their friend, but he isn't going to hold back anymore. Orochimaru then appears and stops Sasuke, saying that as long as the Konoha ninjas are hunting Akatsuki then they are temporary allies and they leave.</p><p>After returning to the Leaf village, Naruto begins learning elemental recomposition with Kakashi and Yamato. Kakashi explains that everyone's chakra has a specific elemental affinity, his own being lightning and Yamato's being both water and earth thanks to his unique bloodline limit. It's learned that Naruto's affinity is wind, something's that's kinda rare, and Kakashi advises Naruto to go see <a href=\"/asuma/4005-44514/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44514\">Asuma</a> for some advice since Asuma also has a wind affinity. Asuma explains that wind has a special cutting property, and shows this by charging his trench knife with wind chakra and throwing it straight through a tree. Naruto then goes back to train. Kakashi inspires Naruto to use a few dozen Shadow Clones to help him learn it quicker and Yamato uses his ability to suppress the Kyuubi's chakra to allow Naruto to use an excess amount of chakra without sprouting tails.</p><p>Once Naruto learns how to use his wind chakra a few days later, Kakashi reveals that the Rasengan is actually an incomplete technique since the 4th Hokage intended to combine the Rasengan with his own elemental affinity. Kakashi also reveals that he can use the Rasengan, and that the Chidori was created from his failed attempt at trying to combine his lightning affinity with the Rasengan... but he believes that Naruto will be able to succeed where both him and Minato failed. Naruto then begins trying to combine the two. While this is happening, Asuma, Shikamaru, and 3 other Leaf ninjas set out to capture Akatsuki members. They encounter <a href=\"/hidan/4005-44997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44997\">Hidan</a> and <a href=\"/kakuzu/4005-44998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44998\">Kakuzu</a> and attack, however Asuma is killed in the conflict.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-617888\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/617888-naruto_s_wind_rasengan.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.92553191489362\" data-width=\"376\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 376px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/617888-naruto_s_wind_rasengan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-617888\"><img alt=\"Rasenshuriken\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15297/617888-naruto_s_wind_rasengan.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/617888-naruto_s_wind_rasengan.jpg 376w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15297/617888-naruto_s_wind_rasengan.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Rasenshuriken\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15297/617888-naruto_s_wind_rasengan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/617888-naruto_s_wind_rasengan.jpg 376w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15297/617888-naruto_s_wind_rasengan.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rasenshuriken</figcaption></figure><p>Some time later after preparation, Shikamaru, Chouji, Ino, and Kakashi set out to avenge Asuma. Naruto and Yamato show up to save Kakashi, Ino, and Chouji in their losing battle against Kakuzu while Sakura and Sai goes to aid Shikamaru against Hidan. Naruto insists on fighting Kakuzu by himself, he uses his Shadow Clones to surround Kakuzu and attempts to hit Kakuzu with his new Rasenshuriken while he's distracted... he fails however, and is saved from certain death by Yamato and Kakashi. Naruto then tries again. Kakuzu doesn't believe the Shadow Clones have enough chakra to use such a high-level technique so he ignores them and focuses only on the original. Kakuzu succeeds in killing the one using the Rasenshuriken, however this turns out to be a Shadow Clone and the real Naruto hits Kakuzu from behind with the attack. The technique destroyed two of Kakuzu's hearts and cut him internally, severing his nerves leaving him immobile. The technique however is incomplete since it harms Naruto aswell and Tsunade has deemed it a forbidden technique.</p><p>After Kakashi and Naruto make a full recovery, they set out with Sakura, Sai, Yamato, Kiba, Shino, and Hinata to track down Sasuke whom has managed to defeat Orochimaru and has gone after Itachi. In their search they first encounter Kabuto whom has grafted some of Orochimaru's remains onto himself, and has expressed that he's trying to stop Orochimaru from taking over his body. He said he's going to use Orochimaru's power and surpass him, and thanks Naruto for inspiring him to do so. He then gives them a book with all of the information he has collected on Akatsuki and leaves.</p><p>Naruto uses his Shadow Clones and they go off in different directions, one find Itachi and the two have a brief exchange of words until Itachi leaves. Another finds Sasuke, but Sasuke destroys it and Naruto and co. then close in, but they are stopped by <a href=\"/tobi/4005-45000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45000\">Tob</a> <a href=\"/tobi/4005-45000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45000\">i</a>. Naruto rushes in against Kakashi's advice and starts to get knocked around. All of them attempt to take down this mysterious Akatsuki whom wasn't in Kabuto's book, but he does little more than toy with them until <a href=\"/zetsu/4005-45020/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45020\">Zets</a>u appears and reveals that Itachi died fighting Sasuke. Tobi and Zetsu then leave, with Naruto and co. quickly rushing after, but both Sasuke and Itachi's corpse are gone by the time they get there.</p><p>Everyone returns home after their failed mission and Naruto remembers what happened with Itachi. Itachi put Naruto in a genjutsu where their conversation went alot farther. Naruto exclaimed that he's more of a brother to Sasuke than Itachi is. Itachi wondered what Naruto would do if Sasuke attacked Konoha, and wondered if he could make the choice to kill Sasuke or let Konoha fall. Naruto insisted that he'd find a way to subdue Sasuke and not let anything happen to Konoha... Itachi then gave Naruto a technique and hoped that he'd never have to use it.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2520010\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png\" data-ratio=\"0.56166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2520010\"><img alt=\"Naruto's Sadness over Jiraiya's Death\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png 600w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Naruto's Sadness over Jiraiya's Death\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png 600w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130928/2520010-369732_607px_naruto_after_jirayia_s_death_super.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Naruto's Sadness over Jiraiya's Death</figcaption></figure><p>Naruto is then visited by Kakashi, Gamabunta and Gamakichi that tell him the head toad, Fukasaku, wants to see him. Naruto goes to Tsunade's office where Fukasaku and some other toads are waiting. Fukasaku tells Naruto that Jiraiya was defeated by Pein, in which Naruto blamed Tsunade and stormed off. He was later comforted by Iruka and Shikamaru. He then helped Shikamaru try to decode Jiraiya's secret message. It turned out to be a page numbers from one of Jiraiya's books, but the code is a little confusing; it could mean \"the real one isn't there\" or \"the real one doesn't exist.\" Fukasaku knows it's about Pein, however he doesn't know it's significance. Meanwhile, Ibiki is interrogating the Rain ninja Jiraiya sent back and Shizune is doing an autopsy on the Pein body Jiraiya sent back in order to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. Naruto says that he's going to avenge Jiraiya, but Fukasaku says that only Jiraiya was capable of beating Pein and Naruto would surely die... unless he were to be trained in Senjutsu like Jiraiya was. Naruto asked if that would make him powerful enough to defeat Pein, but Fukasaku said that it depends on him. They then leave to train at Myouboku mountain. Since it would take a month to get there and the path is like a labyrinth, the two are reverse summoned there by Gamabunta. There, Fukasaku explains that Senjutsu allows the user to become one with nature and harness it's power, converting it into chakra and increases one's taijutsu and genjutsu, Fukasaku then lifts a statue far larger than himself as an example. He says that the training is hard, however, and that Naruto may die...</p><p>Though worried about the allusion of dying to become a sage, it's explained that Naruto may cease to exist as a human but Naruto insists on doing the training. Fukasaku tells Naruto it's difficult and takes quite some time to learn, however Naruto pressed that he didn't have much time and asked if there was a faster way, and so Fukasaku introduced Naruto to Toad Oil. Fukasaku explains that it will forcefully draw natural chakra into him and eventually he'll be able to do it by himself. Naruto immediately finds the catch of using the toad oil and he began to turn into a human frog once the natural energy began seeping into him, only Fukasaku's special stick is able to knock the natural energy out and return Naruto back to normal.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-558837\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/558837-17.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.91435768261965\" data-width=\"397\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 397px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/558837-17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-558837\"><img alt=\"Jiraiya's Sage Mode\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/558837-17.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/558837-17.jpg 397w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/558837-17.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jiraiya's Sage Mode\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/558837-17.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/558837-17.jpg 397w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/558837-17.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jiraiya's Sage Mode</figcaption></figure><p>The old frog explains a balance must be met to fully utilize natural energy and maintain one's current state at will. Naruto had done well at balancing physical and spiritual chakra and must now introduce the natural energy into the balance: using too little won't do anything, but using too much will turn you into a frog forever. Naruto learns even Jiraiya could not use senjutsu without partially transforming into a toad, but Fukasaku expressed that balancing senjutsu was almost impossible and hundreds had failed which made Jiraiya's achievement remarkable. Naruto decides not to fear the consquences and declared Jiraiya's way of ninja to be his own. Naruto decides to speed up his training using Shadow Clones to gain more experience like when learning the Rasenshuriken, but Fukasaku warned him that if any of his clones were to be unable to balance natural chakra that he'd suffer the same consequences.</p><p>Fukasaku informs Naruto that only gutsy people like himself and Jirayia had the capability to even feel natural energy, and only people with vast chakra like himself and Jiraiya could even hope to use senjutsu. This gets Naruto fired up and he jumps in the entire pond of Toad Oil. After much training to balance natural chakra, Naruto would himself transform partially into a toad but can use senjutsu, and Fukasaku said it's time for Naruto to learn to do it without the Toad Oil. But before that, he hands Naruto the first book Jiraiya wrote and says that Naruto now holds the heart of Jiraiya in his hands and Naruto was moved to tears when he read it.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-558811\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/558811-07.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.6775\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/558811-07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-558811\"><img alt=\"Naruto's Sage Mode\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/558811-07.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/558811-07.jpg 400w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/558811-07.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Naruto's Sage Mode\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/558811-07.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/558811-07.jpg 400w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/558811-07.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Naruto's Sage Mode</figcaption></figure><p>Naruto asked why he had to learn to use senjutsu on his own and wondered if he could just bring Toad Oil into battle, but Fukasaku explained that the oil would quickly evaporate if it were to leave Myouboku mountain. Afterwards he continued training with Fukasaku, whom expressed that Naruto must remain still to harness natural chakra, decided to make Naruto remain still by making him balance on a platform set around jagged spikes. Naruto initially had a hard time balancing and Fukasaku saved Naruto with his tongue, but Naruto would eventually come to maintain balance and showed that he could use senjutsu without transforming at all except for his eyes which appear toad-like. However when a bird landed on Naruto's shoulder he fell over and crashed into the spikes, but he was unharmed since he was in Hermit Mode. With his training in senjutsu complete, Fukasaku decided to show Naruto some frog-style combat and Naruto even continued training after Fukasaku went to sleep.</p><p>While Fukasaku and Naruto are training, Fukasaku brings up the time-limit of Hermit Mode and his solution to it. After Naruto absorbs natural energy, he'll only be able to use Hermit Mode for a few minutes unless he stops to absorb more natural energy which is something he can't keep doing during battle, so Fukasaku will sit on Naruto's shoulder and act as a conductor, continuously pulling natural energy into Naruto during battle. He revealed that Jiraiya used the same strategy during battle.</p><p>Naruto and Fukasaku tried to merge together, but couldn't because the demon fox rejected Fukasaku. Knowing he has no other option, Naruto insisted that he would perform Hermit Mode activation while moving, to which Fukusaku protested. This was short-lived, however, as Naruto was later seen attempting this very feat. Naruto kept on attemtping to run while gathering Natural energy, but couldn't maintain it. Fukasaku then said that to do it, you'd have to look both left and right at the same time. After hearing that, Naruto recalled that moment when Kakashi said that. Naruto and Fukasaku were later told by another frog that the messenger toad in Konoha had died. Fukasaku knew Shima was near Konoha and sent a messenger frog to tell her to summon them there. Naruto is summoned with Fukasaku, Gamakichi, Gamaken, Gamasushi, and Gamabunta in the midst of destruction after Pain unleashed his ultimate Shinra Tensei and Naruto finds most his friends injuried and near death. Tsunade was set to fight in her weakened condition against Pain, whom is attacked by the resurrected Asura Realm which Naruto intervenes and destroys in a single blow.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2740313\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png\" data-ratio=\"0.56166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2740313\"><img alt=\"Return of Naruto\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png 600w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Return of Naruto\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png 600w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/144102/2740313-369733_800px_naruto_and_fukasaku_super.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Return of Naruto</figcaption></figure><p>Having defeated Asura Realm, Naruto calls out to Gamakichi ordering him to take Tsunade to safety as he arrives. Naruto asks Tsunade to leave Pein to him, and ask the villagers to stay out of the way. She agree's, leaving Katsuyu with Naruto to feed him the intel gained by Konoha's shinobi. Fukasaku and Shima, having come with Gamakichi, hop onto Naruto's scroll intending to battle alongside him. Naruto question's Tsunade on Kakashi's whereabouts, as he cannot since his chakra along with the rest of the villagers, and takes her silence as an answer. He tells Gamakichi to leave.</p><p>As Gamakichi takes Tsunade to safety, Animal Realm launches an assault against Naruto. She summons her rhino, who charges Naruto intent on crushing or impaling him. Naruto is able to effortlessly catch his horn, stopping the rhino cold, before hurling him over his shoulder. Animal Realm responds by summoning both one of her dogs and a bull. Fukasaku and Shima launch into action, using their Sage:Frog Song technique, while Naruto rushes them. Calling to shadow-clones to him, Naruto prepares a rasengan in each hand, continuing on to the other Peins he hands them off to his clones. Using the Rasengan he created, each clone creats a Sage Technique: Oodama Rasengan and blasts the two summons away. The summons follow the same path as the rhino, flying into the waiting blades of Gamabunta and his toads.</p><p>As the next Hungry Ghost rushes forward to face Naruto, Katsuyu informs Naruto that ninjustu are useless, as this Pein is able to absorb them all. Naruto takes the information in stride, confidently stating he'll simply use Frog Kata. As the Pein attempts to stab him with a hidden blade, Naruto dodges, aiming a punch at his face but not connecting. The other Pein's are surprised when their fellow is blasted backwards, God Realm commenting on how it seemed he deflected the blow.</p><p>It's revealed that Frog Kata allows Naruto to use the Natural Energy around him to enhance the range of his attacks, manipulating it to his will. Naruto then stands alone against the remaining Peins, and prepares his new technique, ready to end the battle. Naruto creates two Shadow Clones, and with their help creates his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken, now completed, and faces off with the Peins.</p><p>Pain finally realizes that Naruto is using the same Hermit Mode Jiraiya used and reveals that he too was a student of Jiraiya. Naruto becomes furious that someone who trained under the man would become so violent to the point of rejecting his teachings and even kill his former teacher.

Shima uses Dust Cloud to blind all of the Peins while Naruto works in combination with Gamabunta to take down Animal Path with a Twin Rasengan inside of Gamabunta's mouth. With Animal gone, the multiplying dog summon dispersed.</p><p>But Naruto finally ran out of enough nature chakra to sustain Hermit Mode and reverts to an exhausted normal state and is sprung upon by Deva, with the two exchanging blows in hand to hand combat. It's revealed that Naruto left Shadow Clones back at Myouboku mountain using Hermit Mode, and Fukasaku reverse summoned one so that it would allow Naruto to use Hermit Mode once again upon ending the jutsu.</p><p>Naruto broke Deva's chakra spike and, once again in Hermit Mode, kicked Deva aside. Naruto then created another Rasenshuriken and threw it at Deva, but Hungry Ghost reappeared and absorbed it, Naruto realized that Hell revived it. Naruto then hit the ground with a Rasengan to create a dirt cloud and threw another Rasenshuriken, but it transformed into Naruto and tackled Hungry Ghost, allowing the real Rasenshuriken to hit Deva but his power finally returned and deflected it. Naruto then put his elbow over Hungry Ghost's face as a Shadow Clone dived at Hell with Twin Rasengan.</p><p>The Shadow Clone dives at Deva as Naruto is about to crush Hungry Ghost's head, but Deva pushed them back. Gamabunta, Gamaken, and Hiro leap in to help, but Deva also pushes them away. During this time, Fukasaku tells Naruto to use a genjutsu, which Naruto says he can't do, so Fukasaku and Shima volunteer but say they need time to gather enough natural energy to do it. Deva then pulls Naruto towards him and Hungry Ghost grabs him and drains the natural energy from his body, returning him to normal. Shima and Fukasaku tell Naruto to hang on.</p><p>While being forced to remain still, Naruto starts to absorb natural energy and Hungry Ghost suffers \"toad petrification,\" and literally breaks free from his grip. Deva sees Fukasaku and Shima preparting their genjutsu and pulls Fukasaku towards himself and stabs him with his spike, then throws him at Naruto and then proceeds to slam Naruto into the ground and stab his hands. Pein goes on to compare Naruto's way and his own way of peace. Naruto is impaled in none vital points by Pein. This was to keep him from moving. Hinata then jumps in to protect Naruto from being taken by Pein. She finally confesses her love for Naruto. Pein takes out Hinata to push Naruto to a level he never experienced before. He becomes engulf by the power of the Kyuubi and reveals six tails this time with a skeletal frame forming about him as well. Pein is unafraid cause he feels his pain is greater. Naruto overcomes the seals placed upon him by Yamato. He attacks Pein and is able to turn his gravital attacks back on him. Naruto was set to kill Pein with the gathered fox chakra built at his mouth. Pein pushes at Naruto to slightly detour his attack. He flees with Naruto doggedly chasing his primary target. The pair leave the village as Pein is preparing a secret attack.Pein uses chibaku tensei,a jutsu technique which creates a black sphere and pulls everything which has mass into its surroundings.The six-tailed fox is trapped inside the ball of earth.The nine-tailed fox manipulated naruto and the seal placed by the 4th hokage starts to distort and naruto turns into a eight-tailed fox.Just when,naruto is about to pull off the seal,the 4th hokage apppears and reveals that naruto is his son.Nauro then cries. The 4th hokage brings naruto to another place of his mind and naruto punches him, saying that he is not sure if he is pissed off or happy and asks the 4th hokage why he sealed the nine-tailed naruto inside him. The 4th hokage then answers by saying that he did it as he thought that naruto could control and use the fox's power as he was his son. He then reveals that there was a powerful ninja controlling the fox,a atsasuki member wearing a mask and that naruto could not defeat him without a special power.The 4th hokage then reveals that he knows about jiraiya's death and that pain is probably used by the guy wearing a mask.After that,the 4th hokage says that he believes naruto can find the answers to peace himself and he restores the distorted seals,saying that it would be the last time and he is counting on naruto before fading away. After that,the fox disappeared and naruto returns back to normal.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124003\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124003\"><img alt=\"Defeating Pein.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg 1280w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Defeating Pein.\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg 1280w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124003-6086482343-Camin.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Defeating Pein.</figcaption></figure><p>Naruto is in Sage Mode and Chibaku Tensei starts to crumble due to the chakra strain on Nagato. Deva attacks Naruto with an arm spike, but Naruto broke off the spike and kicked Deva away. Naruto uses Rasenshuriken and throws a smoke bomb, Deva deflects it, but then comes another Rasenshuriken and some rocks next to Deva turn out to be Shadow Clones which try to hold Deva in place, but Deva stabs them and leaps out of the way. Suddenly, all the rocks around Deva turn out to be Shadow Clones and they leap at Deva, but they run out of time and Deva pushes them all away. Naruto then had other Shadow Clones throw him and he rammed into Deva with the Rasengan. Naruto then stabbed himself with one of Pein's spikes and traced the chakra signal to Nagato's location and went to meet him.</p><p>Naruto meets Nagato for the first time, face to face. Nagato and Naruto have a argument about peace, hate and Jiraiya's belief. Then Naruto asks Nagato how he turned out this way, as a apprentice of Jiraiya. Nagato begins his story about his past and his first pain, the death of his parents. Then telling Naruto the events that happen after Jiraiya left them and how Yahiko died. Finally explaining his own pain and trying to save the world, his way. After hearing Nagato's story, Naruto agrees and realizes Nagato's pain. Naruto tell Nagato that he will not kill him, but states that he is determined to break the cycle of hatred and honor Jiraiya's wishes. Nagato is surprise and impressive. And now will believe in Naruto as well and also bring back everyone he has kill in Konoha. But this will cost Nagato his own life. Nagato dies.</p><p>Konan takes Nagato and Yahiko's body with her to return to Amegakure. Before going back, Konan tells Naruto she has quit Akatsuki and will help Naruto find peace in the world. Giving Naruto a bouquet of flowers made of paper to symbolize their alliance together. Later Kakashi carries the tired Naruto back to Konoha. When returning to Konoha, Kakashi and Naruto were met with the whole town, praising Naruto as their hero.</p><p>Naruto was cheered as a hero after his victory, but he didn't have time to relax since the Cloud ninjas Karui, Omoi, and Samui came to the Leaf village to for two things: invite the Hokage to a Kage summit, and request permission to assassinate the rogue ninja Sasuke. Danzo, as the new Hokage with Tsunade's coma, gave the order and set out to the summit. Meanwhile Naruto, Sakura, and Sai were overheard talking about Sasuke and were confronted by Karui and Omoi who demanded all the information they had on Sasuke, Naruto however reacted to the threat they posed and attacked. After a short scuffle, it was revealed that Sasuke is aligned with Akatsuki and captured their teacher, Killer Bee. Naruto pleaded with them not to kill Sasuke and offered to help save Killer Bee.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124013\" data-ratio=\"0.56804733727811\" data-width=\"1352\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1352px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.8%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124013\"><img alt=\"Saving Sakura.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.png 1352w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Saving Sakura.\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.png 1352w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124013-6441647511-Narut.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Saving Sakura.</figcaption></figure><p>After this, Naruto along with Kakashi and Yamato ventured out to the Kage summit to beg the Raikage not to kill Sasuke. Naruto succeeded in finding him, but failed at persuading him. Later Naruto was met by Madara in his motel room, but Kakashi and Yamato came to Naruto's aid. Madara insisted that he only wanted to talk and revealed to them about Itachi and why Sasuke's on his current path. He also revealed to them the true history of the Uchiha and Senju clans and how Naruto is just like Hashirama, and then he left. Afterwards, Gaara, Temari, and Kankuro met with Naruto and told him that Sasuke attacked them at the Kage summit and told Naruto he has to make a choice.</p><p>Sakura, Sai, Lee, and Kiba then met up with Naruto, after they left Sai secretly left an Ink Clone behind whom told Kakashi that the others came to the decision to do what's best for the Leaf and the world and kill Sasuke. Kakashi and Sai went after Sakura's group while Yamato remained behind to watch after Naruto. Naruto however gives him the slip and goes after Kakashi and the others. Sakura ended up putting her friends to sleep with a powerful sleeping bomb she learned from Tsunade and went after Sasuke alone. Naruto eventually caught up to Sakura and Kakashi as they were confronting Sasuke. Sakura almost killed Sasuke but hesitated, when Sasuke about to kill her Naruto rushed in and saved her. He and Sasuke talked a little but Naruto couldn't reason with him, they then clashed and knocked each other away but Zetsu saved Sasuke and called Madara for help whom teleported the 3 away and Naruto, Kakashi, Sakura, and <a href=\"/karin/4005-48053/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48053\">Karin</a> went back to the Leaf village.</p><p>Naruto was about to eat at the ramen shop, but is summoned by Fukasaku to Myouboku mountain where Shima had dinner ready. There were two matters, the first was the Great Sage's prophecy where Naruto would train with an octopus on a island and fight someone with great power in their eyes. After that was the matter of the scroll Jiraiya left to Naruto containing the key to the Kyuubi's seal. Naruto learns that the Kyuubi is a create of pure hate and when he draws upon the Kyuubi's chakra it's willpower goes with it and tries to control Naruto, so in order to control the Kyuubi he has to learn to only draw upon the Kyuubi's chakra and block out it's mind.</p><p>The Kages agreed on a safe place for Naruto and Killer Bee, a treacherous island located in the Cloud village which is used for the Cloud's Chuunin exams, it's location makes it hard to get to and has a barrier to warn of intruders. Naruto travels to the island accompanied by Yamato, Gai, Aoba, and a few other Leaf ninjas. The ships is attacked by a giant squid which Killer Bee fights off in his Bijuu form and meets the Leaf ninjas. At the island they are greeted by the person that's in charge of the island, Motoi. On the way to where they'd be staying it's revealed that Killer Bee tamed the beasts on the island and they're safe with him, and it was that island where Killer Bee learned to control the Hachibi. Once at their rooms, Naruto immediately went to Killer Bee's room to get trained, but Killer Bee refused saying that he was supposed to be on vacation for the first time in his life. Naruto tried to impress him and tried to rap, which Killer Bee liked but Naruto accidentally insulted his sunglasses. Panicking, Naruto used his Harem jutsu to persuade Killer Bee, but it failed. Naruto then went to Motoi to complain about Killer Bee turning him away and Motoi decided to show Naruto where Killer Bee first started to learn to control the Hachibi, sitting at a waterfall which reveals your true self. Here, Naruto's confronted by a dark version of himself.</p><p>Naruto was unable to defeat the dark side of himself, they were matched evenly in every way and Naruto was forced to leave the waterfall. He asked Motoi for anything he knew that could help him, and after Killer Bee forgave Motoi for trying to kill him when they were younger, Naruto realized how to overcome his dark side... accept it instead of resisting it. Killer Bee then brought Naruto to a temple where Naruto could confront the Kyuubi, and if he loses the Kyuubi won't be able to escape the temple. Naruto confronts the Kyuubi and releases the seal and frees the Kyuubi and the two begin to battle. Hachibi tries to restrain the Kyuubi but Kyuubi fights it off, Kyuubi then tries to blast Naruto but the Hachibi catches it and snuffs it out, however it's not at full power within Naruto and can't help anymore after containing the blast. Naruto activates Sage Mode and uses Gargantuan Rasengan, but the Kyuubi blocks it and smacks Naruto away. Kyuubi slams Naruto to the ground, but it turns out to be a Shadow Clone and another Naruto throws the Kyuubi onto it's back while other Narutos throw the Rasenshuriken at it. While the Kyuubi is weakened Naruto tries to pull th Kyuubi's chakra, however it begins to overpower him, but then suddenly <a href=\"/kushina-uzumaki/4005-50361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50361\">Kushina</a> appears.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124014-9784548550-____m.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124014\" data-ratio=\"0.57222222222222\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.2%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124014-9784548550-____m.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124014\"><img alt=\"Meeting his mother for the first time.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124014-9784548550-____m.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124014-9784548550-____m.png 900w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124014-9784548550-____m.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Meeting his mother for the first time.\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124014-9784548550-____m.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124014-9784548550-____m.png 900w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124014-9784548550-____m.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Meeting his mother for the first time.</figcaption></figure><p>Naruto initially believed Kushina to be the Kyuubi's true form, or a trick of some sort, but he realized that she's his mom because she acts like him. She then binds the Kyuubi in chains so that her and Naruto can talk, saying that Minato sealed both a piece of himself and her in Naruto to help as much as they could for Naruto to control the Kyuubi. Naruto was happy that she was pretty and wondered what he would look like with red hair, and then asked her how she and Minato fell in love. Kushina began to tell Naruto about when she first moved to Konoha, she was a little chunky in the face and the boys made fun of her, calling her \"Tomato,\" and she beat them all up for it which earned her a new nickname, \"The Bloody Habanero.\" And when she first saw Minato, she thought he was just a flakey girly-boy and looked down on him. That is until the Cloud village kidnapped her for her special chakra, she pulled out strands of her hair so she could be found, but it was only Minato who noticed it and saved her, that's when she fell in love with him. She then asked Naruto what happens when you cross the \"Yellow Flash\" with the \"Bloody Habanero,\" and Naruto answered the \"Orange Hokage\" and gained new resolve against the Kyuubi. He re-activated Sage Mode and attacked the Kyuubi with many Shadow Clones, each one using a Gargantuan Rasengan. Kyuubi managed to destroy many of them with a swipe of it's huge claw, but the remaining ones slammed into him with their Rasengans. Naruto then hit him with another Rasenshuriken and successfully gained control of the Kyuubi's chakra. After which, Kushina revealed shocking news, that she was the previous host of the Kyuubi, and she starts to explain to Naruto what happened on the night of his birth...</p><p>Kushina explains that she was chosen as the Kyuubi's host and that she arrived from the Land of Whirlpools in order to become the new host for the Kyuubi in The Land of Fire. The \"Eddy\" village in the Land of Whirlpools had strong relations with Konoha due to their past leaders having distant blood relations with the Senju Clan. Kushina explains that the \"Eddy\" village's Uzumaki clan specialized in sealing techniques and phenomenal longevity, which also explains the 4 element seal on Naruto's stomach and the whirlpool design on every Konoha flak jacket as a sign of friendship and good will with the \"Eddy\" village and Konoha. Unfortunately, the \"Eddy\" village was feared across the globe for their powerful sealing techniques and the constant wars plaguing their village eventually led to their downfall. Luckily, Kushina and a few \"Eddy\" villagers managed to survive and scattered across the globe. Before Kushina becomes the vessel for the Kyuubi, she must be filled with the emotion of love in order to quell the rage and power of the Kyuubi. The previous Jinchuuriki, Mito Uzumaki Senju, accomplishes just that for Kushina. Kushina elaborates to Naruto of the masked murderer that released the Kyuubi that same night when Naruto was born 16 years ago, revealing that her seal on the Kyuubi weakens most during childbirth, as the chakra needed to power the seal and her body needs to be redirected to the baby inside her. Meanwhile, Minato, Sarutobi, and Biwako are taking preparations under way to prevent the Kyuubi from spilling loose during Kushina's childbirth. Biwako, leading Kushina out of Konoha, takes her to a secret hideout in the outskirts of Konoha for her to give birth to her child. While Biwako and Taji attempt to get Naruto out of Kushina during the birth, Minato struggles to keep the seal on the Kyuubi from crushing under the pressure of the Kyuubi's rage as it struggles to break out of Kushina. Whilst outside, a masked murderer has already slaughtered the ANBU Black Ops guarding the secret hideout. He swiftly charges in, kills Biwako and Taji, and forcefully takes Naruto from their grasps just as he is born. The masked murderer, holding a kunai to Naruto's throat, tells Minato to back away from the Jinchuuriki or else his son will die at the ripe old age of 1 minute.</p><p>Minato, in a burst of speed, grabs Naruto from the air as the masked murderer throws baby Naruto into the air in order to stab him. As Minato catches Naruto, he notices the cloth he's wrapped in is covered in explosive tags. Minato, using his \" Flying Thunder God\" technique, teleports himself and baby Naruto to a safehouse of his. Sadly, this separates Minato from Kushina. With this time, the masked murderer takes Kushina to a secluded area to remove the Kyuubi from her possession. The masked murder pulls out the fox and takes possession of it through use of the Sharingan!</p><p>As Kushina calls to his attention, the masked man seeks the fox on her. Luckily, Minato put a seal on Kushina's seal that allowed him to teleport to her location and save her. He takes her back to the safehouse to stay with baby Naruto while Minato himself goes to fulfill his duties as the 4th Hokage and protect the village.</p><p>The Masked man sneaks into the village in the cover of night, and summons the fox to his location with no warning. Villagers panic as they take action against the fox. Minato appears and the fox realizes him, standing on the Hokage Memorial Mountain. The fox fire one of its blasts of concentrated chakara at him, but Minato uses a special seal to teleport the blast safely outside the village. The masked man realizes Minato as a threat and tries to sneak up on Minato. Luckily, Minato is capable of defending himself. However, the masked man takes himself and Minato to somewhere outside the village. Minato then suspects the masked man to actually be Madara, because of his plans to destroy the Leaf Village and his sharingan and control of the fox. Of course, the masked man doesn't answer Minato, so the two fight. During the fight, Minato analyzes the way the masked man's space/time jutsu works. Throughout their fight, the masked man uses chains to try and restrain Minato, but to no avail. Minato and the masked man then rush at each, with a burst of speed, Minato forming a rather large Rasengan.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124018\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"1366\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1366px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124018\"><img alt=\"Preparing to tame the Nine-Tails.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg 1366w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Preparing to tame the Nine-Tails.\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg 1366w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124018-6451020669-narut.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Preparing to tame the Nine-Tails.</figcaption></figure><p>Minato dupes the masked man by sending his special kunai knife at him, which, of course, fades right through him. The masked man then gets a hold of Minato's shoulder, only to have Minato teleport to the kunai that went through the masked man ( which was still in mid-air) and slam his Rasengan down onto the man's back. The masked is barely able to teleport away to avoid most of the damage. Minato teleports to the man ( via a seal/tag that he strategically placed on him during their fight) and performs a contract seal that makes the man lose his control over the fox. The man then states how Madara truly deserved his title, and leaves. Minato's attention is then diverted to the fox at the village. The fox regains control over himself, but continues his rampage over the village. The third Hokage and many ninja are fighting to hold the fox back. The fox then starts up another one of its chakara blasts, but Minato comes in the nick of time and uses Gamabunta to land on the fox and temporarily restrain him. Minato then teleports himself and the fox away from the village, to let the blast detonate safely.</p><p>Minato teleports it near Kushina, where she uses her special chakara chains to restrain it. She volunteers to seal back into herself, but Minato decided to use the Dead Demon Consuming Seal to seal half of the foxes chakara into himself (since it would be impossible to seal it all into one being) and the other half into Naruto. Minato saw Naruto as the \" Child of Prophecy\" that Jiraiya told him about. He said Naruto would need the fox in order to defeat the evil Madara. Kushina is distraught, but Minato tells her to have faith as he is their son, after all. Minato starts the sealing jutsu, which takes half of the foxes chakara, drastically reducing its original size to the size we see inside Naruto (which is still rather large.) Kushina's chain weaken due to her being weakened from surviving the extraction of the Kyuubi (due to her clan's longevity), and the fox realizes they want to seal him/it inside Naruto. It takes this opportunity to try and kill baby Naruto. Minato and Kushina jump in front of its claw and just barely stop it from reaching Naruto. With the claw inside them, they speak their final words to Naruto, especially Kushina. Minato summons Gerotora, and gave the scroll toad the key to Naruto's seal, to send it to Jiraiya. Minato then commenced with sealing the rest of the foxes chakara inside Naruto and, with his last breath, asked the Third Hokage (one of the only 3 spectators of the event) that not Naruto be looked upon as a monster.</p><p>We then switch back to the present inside Naruto's mind.

Killer Bee and Yamato ask Naruto what happened, and he explains how he now has control off the fox. He reaches deep down and takes some of the foxes chakra, which he separated from the fox in an area of its own, represented as a white sphere. Naruto takes some of the chakra and transforms. His new form allows him to sense evil thoughts and malice (like the fox) and says that Bee's new sword, Samehada, has Kisame inside it. Kisame notes how not even the best chakra sensors could've known he was there, and tries to escape. However, Naruto, in a yellow flash, slams his foot into Kisame at high speed, causing Kisame to cough up blood. Kisame still escapes, having Bee run after him, as Yamato helps Naruto gets his foot out of the wall from the speeds he slammed into Kisame.</p><p>Outside, Kisame runs into Maito Guy, only to be slammed into the mountain/cliffside by Guy.</p><p>After the ordeal with Kisame was over, Killer Bee resumed training with Naruto. After gaining control of the Kyuubi's chakra, Killer Bee wanted to get Naruto to learn how to use the Kyuubi's abilities and gave Naruto his first task of stacking blocks. This proved to be tricky at first since Naruto had to learn to pick them up without crushing them, but ultimately got the hang of it.</p><p>Bee then takes Naruto to another room where they will learn the final level of his training. Bee then tell Naruto that he will have to transform into the Kyuubi and learn how to use the \"Chakra Bomb\" which is compressed energy that you shoot from your mouth. When Naruto tries and fails at transforming they decide to give up on learning the Chakra Bomb since you have to be in the Bijuu form to use it, and to focus on using his other abilities in that form. Bee allows Hachibi to take over and tell Naruto the dangers of using the Kyuubi's chakra; when drawing upon the Bijuu's chakra, the Bijuu is also devouring your chakra, so Naruto</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1543144\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1543144-1o1u6.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.78496868475992\" data-width=\"479\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 479px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1543144-1o1u6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1543144\"><img alt=\"Kyuubi Rasengan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1543144-1o1u6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1543144-1o1u6.jpg 479w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1543144-1o1u6.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kyuubi Rasengan\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1543144-1o1u6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1543144-1o1u6.jpg 479w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1543144-1o1u6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kyuubi Rasengan</figcaption></figure><p>can't remain in his transformed state forever; because of this, Naruto also can't use Shadow Clones in his transformed state since they use so much of Naruto's chakra. After this Naruto tries to use Rasengan, using his chakra shroud instead of Shadow Clones, but using the Kyuubi chakra is proving tricky for Naruto. Upon seeing it, Killer Bee says that the Rasengan was a near identical replication of the \"chakra bomb\" and was impressed that it could even used by humans. Now all Naruto has to do is use it when he is in his nine tails chakra mode.</p><p>As Naruto was trying to perfect the new version of the Rasengan the war was still going on without him even noticing. However, two resurrected ninjas named the Gold and Silver Brothers were famous for their skills and the fact that the each have a portion of the Nine-Tail's chakra. Due to this, Naruto was able to figure out that he was being kept against his will.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Uzumaki Naruto</p><ul><li><b>Blood Type</b>: B</li><li><b>Highest Rank:</b> Hokage</li><li><b>Classification:</b> Jinchuriki, Sage</li><li><b>Birthdate:</b> October 10 <b>Zodiac Sign:</b> Libra</li><li><b>Age Line:</b> 12-16 <b>Height:</b> 145.3-166 cm <b>Weight:</b> 40.1-50.9 kg. <b>Known Relatives:</b> <a href=\"/\">Uzumaki Kushina</a> (Mother,deceased), <a href=\"/\">Minato Namikaze</a> (Father, deceased), <a href=\"/karin/4005-48053/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48053\">Uzumaki Karin</a> (known survivor of Uzumaki clan)</li></ul><h2>Abilities</h2><p><b>Entire list of Jutsu:</b></p><ul><li>All Directions Shuriken Clone Jutsu</li><li>Shadow Clone jutsu</li><li>Clone Body Blow</li><li>Multiple Shadow Clone jutsu</li><li>One Thousand Years of Death</li><li>Spinning Heel Drop</li><li>Spiralling Super Large Group Spheres</li><li>Uzumaki Formation</li><li>Naruto Uzumaki Combo</li><li>Naruto Uzumaki Two Thousand Combo</li><li>Bijuu Chakra Blast (post transformation)</li><li>Tailed Beast Arms</li><li>Tailed Beast Rasengan</li><li>Fuuma Shuriken Transformation</li><li>Gargantuan Rasengan</li><li>Harem jutsu</li><li>Oodama Rasengan</li><li>Rasengan</li><li>Wind Release: Rasengan</li><li>Wind Release: Rasenshuriken</li><li>Great Ball Rasengan</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1834993\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.6875\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1834993\"><img alt=\"Sage Art: Great Ball Rasengan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg 800w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sage Art: Great Ball Rasengan\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg 800w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1834993-800px_odama_rasengan.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sage Art: Great Ball Rasengan</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Sage Art: Great Ball Rasengan</li><li>Sage Art: Super Great Ball Rasengan</li><li>Sage Art: Super Great Ball Rasen Tarengan</li><li>Sage Technique: Rasenrengan</li><li>Sage Mode</li><li>Sexy Jutsu</li><li>Frog Kata</li><li>Summoning Technique</li><li>Sage Art: Bijuu Dama Rasenshuriken</li><li>Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken</li><li>Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasenshuriken</li><li>Sage Art: Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken</li><li>Boil Release: Unrivalled Strength.</li><li>Reverse Harem Jutsu.</li></ul><h2>Process of Jutsus</h2><p>At the beginning of the series the only jutsu that Naruto know is the Sexy Jutsu, a transformation jutsu which turns him into a naked lady shrouded in smoke clouds. Though he couldn't do the Clone Technique at the start he quickly learns the Multiple Shadow Clone and the Shadow Clone Jutsu, a stronger clone jutsu that lets the clones become physical. This is a jounin level jutsus. Through the show and manga this is his most commonly used jutsus.</p><p>With the help of the Shadow Clone Jutsu he can use the Rasengan, which is a spiraling sphere of energy which he thrusts at the opponent. In Naruto: Shippuden (Part ll) he develops a stronger version called the Oodama Rasengan. When in one tailed demon fox form he can perform the Rasengan with one hand with the help of the demon fox's chakra.</p><p>Jiraiya teaches him a toad summoning Jutsu. With chakra and a small sacrifice of blood he can summon a toad. Because of his poor chakra control he can't summon the toad he wants and will randomly summon Gamakichi, Gamatatsu, or the gigantic Gamabunta. As the toads have minds of their own, Naruto initially had difficulty controlling them.</p><p>In Part ll Naruto an creat the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. He mixes his wind based chakra along with the Rasengan, but he shapes the wind chakra to form a four-pointed shuriken. Even though it looks like a shuriken it can't be thrown like one. It needs to be at point blank range to hit. When it's succesful the victim is trapped in a spiraling dome of wind and is attack by small blades that can hit on a cellular level.</p><p>Naruto has come quite far in his skills as a ninja, while still technically a Genin he has the skill of an \"S\" ranked Ninja. He also has enough skill to pass on his knowledge and training to Konohamaru in the use of Rasengan much as Jiraiya trained him.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>During Naruto's two and a half-year training with Jiraiya, he inherited his master's traits and becomes slightly perverted, cunning.</p><h3>Ninja Techniques</h3><p>Naruto is a highly skilled hand to hand combatant and is more than capable of holding a proper sword stance even against the likes of Momoshiki Otsutsuki. His proficiency in Bukijutsu allowed him to fight with Kunai, Shuriken and etc. </p><h3>Chakra</h3><p>Naruto has very large chakra reserves and has far more when accessing the Nine Tailed Fox's chakra.</p><h3>Shadow clone jutsu/ Multi-Shadow Clone jutsu</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1834953\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.56269592476489\" data-width=\"638\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 638px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1834953\"><img alt=\"Multiple Shadow Clones\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg 638w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Multiple Shadow Clones\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg 638w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1834953-naruto_shadow_clones_part_ii.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Multiple Shadow Clones</figcaption></figure><p>This jutsu enables naruto to create copies of himself. However, the clones are solid and can touch or hit things unlike the Clone technique. These clones normally disperse after sufficient damage. Naruto typically uses the clones for decoys, to help him use jutsus, or to gang up on his opponent(s). The clones can concentrate and gather natural energy for Naruto in a battle so that he can enter Sage Mode. In part 2, naruto becomes more proficient with this technique, using it push himself out of the way of an attack, transform into weapons, learn his opponent's weaknesses, and fall for traps in his place.</p><h3>Summoning jutsu</h3><p>Naruto is able to summon large or small toads to use in battle after he signed the toad contract. At first, he was unable to control the toads he summoned but nowadays, he seemed to be able to control them to a greater extent. He can summon Gamabunta, a large toad with a large sword.</p><h3>Sage Mode</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124022\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"1366\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1366px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5124022\"><img alt=\"Perfect Sage Mode.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg 1366w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Perfect Sage Mode.\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg 1366w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11117/111173561/5124022-2716250029-narut.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Perfect Sage Mode.</figcaption></figure><p>During sage mode his strength, speed, and durability is enhanced. If Naruto draws in too much natural energy he will become a frog and if he can't control it he'll turn into a statue. His jutsu attacks also become much more powerful than before. However, he cannot stay in sage mode for too long. Recently, he managed to use clones to gather natural energy while he battled. Once he ran out of Sage chakra, he uses a summoning scroll to summon and dispel his clone so that he has Sage chakra again.</p><h2><b>Different Chakra forms of the Kyuubi power</b></h2><p>Naruto throughout the series has shown great display of being able to manipulate his chakra level from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high, if not at will. One of the things that makes Naruto such a fighter to be head and shoulders above the rest (in the Part II continuity at least, not the time period when he was a child, as he failed almost everything he tried to succeed in) is the Fourth Hokage's legend, the nine tailed fox, Kyuubi, sealed within him. Kyuubi, at time of need, offers his powers to Naruto in a slight amount, due to the fact that if Naruto were to die, then he would die with him. Later on the series Naruto is able to (with his master Jiraiya's training) manipulate the fox's energies to some extent, making him a near unbeatable foe when it come to fighting.</p><p>Two different forms of chakra for 0 tail Naruto. The first stage that has been shown is the more bestial stage then the other form. In this form Naruto's whiskers became longer, darker and more noticeable. His nails grow longer. His teeth start growing fangs and become longer. His jaw is widened. All of his previously injuries are healed at a remarkable rate. He also gets a power boost in this form. His speed, strength, agility, chakra, etc are all increase. Naruto's eyes also become red and the pupils become narrower like an fox. In this form Naruto is in full control but he is shown to be a lot more feral and animal-like. He once usually travels on all fours. It appears that this chakra is triggered by rage, but is later accessed when Naruto wants the fox's chakra. The other version is when Naruto actual goes to the Kyuubi in his body. Naruto demands the Kyuubi to give him his chakra which he calls \"Rent\" for the Kyuubi staying in his body. The Kyuubi gives Naruto his chakra out of respect for his courage to talk to him like that. Naruto body doesn't change at all but a red chakra flows around his body like Ki aura's in the Dragon Ball Franchise. He gets a power boost but it hasn't been said which one of these forms are more powerful. Naruto has recently gained control of the Nine Tail's chakra he's abilites using have yet to be seen however.</p><h4><strong>One Tailed Form</strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-166118\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7482/166118-63704-naruto.gif\" data-ratio=\"1.5037593984962\" data-width=\"133\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 133px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7482/166118-63704-naruto.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-166118\"><img alt=\"1 Tail\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px\" data-width=\"133\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7482/166118-63704-naruto.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7482/166118-63704-naruto.gif 133w\"><noscript><img alt=\"1 Tail\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7482/166118-63704-naruto.gif\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7482/166118-63704-naruto.gif 133w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px\" data-width=\"133\"></noscript></a><figcaption>1 Tail</figcaption></figure><p>This is the form after 0 tail form. This form is more powerful the previous form. Naruto has a lot of the qualities of the last form but this makes him looks more like the Kyuubi then the previous form. His body is engulfed with chakra that takes the form of a fox. The chakra that engulfs him appears to protect him from damage. That may be true but it also puts constant damage to Naruto body.

Even Killer Bee, a very powerful ninja and Jinchuuriki, couldn't follow Naruto, only being able to see a yellow flash. Naruto was able to crash into Kisame, causing Kisame to cough up blood, with no ill effects. His foot got stuck in the wall and he wasn't even hurt. He also gives off life energy ( given by the fact that Yamato's wooden constructs reacted to it, and from Yamato's statement) and able to sense ill will and malice, like the fox.

Although it seems Naruto himself can't explain how he is doing this and when asked about it simply comments that he feels like he \"could do anything\".</p><h4><strong>Six Paths Sage Mode</strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5759951\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5759951\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg 1920w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg 1920w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111286243/5759951-9427607319-maxre.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Additionally, the new powers allow Naruto to touch Madara's Truth Seeking Balls without getting disintegrated in the process. And when using his \"Ashura\" form, he was able to summon and use his own Truth Seeking Balls, as well as use shape manipulation to turn two of them into staffs when attacking or defending, just like the previous 10 tails Jinchuriki Obito and Madara could, although he has long since lost this ability. </p><p>Naruto also has a bit of chakra from all the 9 tailed beasts inside him, which gives him the ability to use all of the chakra natures and combine them to create different Rasengans with various properties. Such as the \"Magnet Release Rasengan\" a Rasengan embed with the 1 tail's chakra (Shukaku) that allows him to seal a target when hit (He used this against Madara's Limbo clone), the \"Lava Release Rasenshuriken\" a Rasenshuriken created using the 4 tails (Son Goku) chakra that he used to cut the Shinju, Or the \"Bijuu Dama (Tailed Beast Bomb) Rasenshuriken\" a Rasengan created using the Nine tails (Kurama) chakra that he used to destroy Madara's Chibaku Tensei meteorites (Note that those meteorites were large enough to dwarf several mountain ranges, and that the explosion from the BB Rasenshuriken was larger than those meteorites, making it the one most destructive attacks shown in the Manga so far.)</p><h4><strong>Six Paths Sage Mode Asura Bijuu Avatar </strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5759926\" data-ratio=\"0.84095860566449\" data-width=\"918\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 918px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.1%\" href=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5759926\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg 918w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg 918w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111286243/5759926-5580940704-5db15.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>While in Six Paths Sage Mode, Naruto creates three Six Paths Sage Mode Kurama clones. One of the clones is then used to gather Nature Energy, while the other two fuse with Naruto as the third clone releases all the Senjutsu Chakra within it, and transfers it to the original. Once all the Chakra is stabilized, three Bijuu avatars have fused into one to create a six armed avatar capable of putting out attacks on an even larger scale than before and fighting on par with Sasuke's Indra's Susanoo.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Alternate Versions of Naruto</strong></h2><h3><strong>Menma</strong></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3052476\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3052476-menma_naruto_shippud_49768.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5384615384615\" data-width=\"390\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 390px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3052476-menma_naruto_shippud_49768.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3052476\"><img alt=\"Evil Naruto\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3052476-menma_naruto_shippud_49768.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3052476-menma_naruto_shippud_49768.jpg 390w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Evil Naruto\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3052476-menma_naruto_shippud_49768.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3052476-menma_naruto_shippud_49768.jpg 390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Evil Naruto</figcaption></figure><p>Tobi managed to transfer Naruto and Sakura to an alternate reality where things were greatly different. In this world, Naruto was named Menma, Minato and Kushina were still alive and Minato never became the 4th Hokage. Menma was also in a relationship with an aggressive extroverted version of Hinata. In this world, unlike Naruto, Menma embraced his hatred which allowed him to form a bond with his reality's Kurama and control it. Menma became a missing-nin for unknown reasons and wanted to both destroy Konoha and help achieve Tobi's Moon's Eye Plan, to which he set out capturing his world's Jinchuuriki. He was later possessed by Tobi and gained Tobi's Sharingan in his right eye, but was eventually defeated by Naruto and released of his hatred.</p><p>He possessed full access to Kurama's chakra and power, giving him the ability to enhance his physical abilities, create chakra shockwaves, sense negative emotions, and fully release Kurama. He also possessed his own dark versions of Naruto's other abilities, including Rasenringu which was similar to Naruto's Rasenshuriken and Dai Rasenringu which could destroy a village, and he could perform these without need of assistance. He could create 9 creatures from Kurama's chakra as well. Lastly, he had an unexplained ability to fly.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>This article is about the second person to use the name Silk Spectre, Laurie Juspeczyk. For the first Silk Spectre, see <a href=\"/sally-jupiter/4005-60464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60464\">Sally Jupiter</a>.</em></p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The daughter of the original Silk Spectre and, unbeknownst to her, the <a href=\"/the-comedian/4005-44193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44193\">Comedian</a>, Laurie Juspecyzk was raised from a young age to carry on her mother's legacy. At 16, feeling stifled by her mother's rules and unsavoury legacy, she ran away to <a href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\">San Francisco</a> with her boyfriend. Returning to her mother sometime later, she was invited to join the <a href=\"/the-crimebusters/4060-46361/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46361\">Crimebusters</a>, where she met <a href=\"/dr-manhattan/4005-40527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40527\">Dr Manhattan</a>, with whom she soon became romantically involved. Retiring as Silk Spectre following the Keene Act of 1977, she moved in with Dr Manhattan and was kept by the government to ensure that Manhattan remained happy and compliant.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Laurie Juspeczyk was created by <a href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\">Alan Moore</a> and <a href=\"/dave-gibbons/4040-4941/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4941\">Dave Gibbons</a>. She made her first appearance in <a href=\"/watchmen-1-watchmen/4000-184078/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-184078\"><em>Watchmen</em> #1</a>. She has no direct inspiration, but is partially based on <a href=\"/nightshade/4005-4881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4881\">Nightshade</a>, <a href=\"/black-canary/4005-1689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1689\">Black Canary</a>, and <a href=\"/phantom-lady/4005-86291/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86291\">Phantom Lady</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Watchmen</h3><p>She and Dr Manhattan are approached by <a href=\"/rorschach/4005-40444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40444\">Rorschach</a> following the death of the Comedian. He attempts to warn them of a potential mask killer, but she angrily demands he leave, and Manhattan teleports him away. Angered by Manhattan's aloofness, she contacts and meets up with <a href=\"/nite-owl-dreiberg/4005-43224/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43224\">Dan Dreiberg</a>, the former Nite Owl. The pair reminisce about super-heroics, and later fight a gang that attacks them. Following Dr Manhattan's self-exile to <a href=\"/mars/4020-55781/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55781\">Mars</a>, she is kicked out of her government accommodations, and offered a place to stay by Dreiberg. The pair soon put on their costumes to rescue people from a burning building, and, exhilarated in the aftermath, begin a physical relationship. She reluctantly agrees to his plan to break the recently-arrested Rorschach out of prison. They succeed, and return to Dreiberg's house, where Dr Manhattan suddenly appears and teleports her to Mars. There, they discuss the value of human life, and Laurie discovers that the Comedian, whom she has long hated for his attempted rape of her mother, was in fact her father. This successfully convinces Manhattan to return them to <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a>, and she is teleported to <a href=\"/antarctica/4020-55940/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55940\">Antarctica</a> where Nite Owl and Rorschach are having their climactic confrontation with <a href=\"/ozymandias/4005-43221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43221\">Adrian Veidt</a>, who has been manipulating events to cause a catastrophe in order to save the world from itself. She shoots Veidt, but he manages to catch the bullet and defeat her. Veidt is able to convince her and the other assembled heroes, save Rorschach, that his plan should be allowed to proceed unhindered. In the aftermath, Juspeczyk and Dreiberg, presumed dead in the explosion in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>, take on new identities as a married couple. She visits her mother to make peace, and she and Dreiberg leave to resume their masked adventures.</p><h3>Before Watchmen</h3><p>Running away from home, Juspeczyk moves to San Francisco with her boyfriend. The pair move in with a group of artists, and Juspeczyk begins to engage in vigilante activities. She becomes involved in investigating a drug ring that is pushing a mind-controlling version of LSD on unsuspecting hippies. Her boyfriend is poisoned by this drug during a party, and she attacks the vendor, Gurustein, and threatens his boss, the Chairman, to put an end to their plan. Unbeknownst to her, her boyfriend is forced by the Comedian to join the <a href=\"/united-states-army/4060-44415/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44415\">Army</a>, and her home is attacked by minions of Chairman.

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>As a child, Nelson Gardner was sickly and asthmatic, but through years of training he managed to overcome his condition and eventually started playing football in college. After college, he joined the U.S. marines. He later adopted the identity Captain Metropolis to fight crime. Along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-60464\" href=\"/sally-jupiter/4005-60464/\" slug=\"sally-jupiter\">Sally Jupiter</a>, he was a founding member of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55987\" href=\"/minutemen/4060-55987/\" slug=\"minutemen\">the Minutemen</a> and later, he founded <a data-ref-id=\"4060-46361\" href=\"/the-crimebusters/4060-46361/\" slug=\"the-crimebusters\">the Crimebusters</a> with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43221\" href=\"/ozymandias/4005-43221/\" slug=\"ozymandias\">Ozymandias</a>. He was apparently in a relationship with fellow Minuteman <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44796\" href=\"/hooded-justice/4005-44796/\" slug=\"hooded-justice\">Hooded Justice</a>, a fact that the Minutemen's publicist, Laurence Schexnayder, worked very hard to cover up. He started the Crimebusters because he thought that by pooling the efforts of the other vigilantes, crime could be effectively wiped out in Manhattan and outside. Both teams eventually fell apart due to personal problems from the team members. He contributed to the hatred of superheroes by expressing bigotry towards African-American and Hispanic people. He was decapitated in a car crash in 1974; the accident, however, would later prove to be suicide. Despite this, there is fan speculation that he, along with Hooded Justice, is still alive at the time of the graphic novel.</p><h2><b>Personality</b></h2><p>Despite being the leader of two superhero teams, Nelson was a nervous, weak-willed individual, most likely due to his health problems, who was often pushed around by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44193\" href=\"/the-comedian/4005-44193/\" slug=\"the-comedian\">the Comedian</a>. It is implied by the Comedian that he is a glory hound, though this is unconfirmed. He also tends to stutter. He is loyal to his friends and it is implied he genuinely wants to fight crime despite his racist attitude.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As a crime fighter, he used his tactical prowess and knowledge gained in the army to beat criminals.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><p>Like the Comedian, Captain Metropolis never appears alive in the story.</p><h2>Watchmen Movie</h2><p>Captain Metropolis appears in <a data-ref-id=\"4025-1\" href=\"/watchmen/4025-1/\" slug=\"watchmen\">the Watchmen movie</a> played by Darryl Scheelar. His role is significantly diminished, as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43224\" href=\"/nite-owl/4005-43224/\" slug=\"nite-owl\">Dan Dreiberg</a> is the one who forms the Crimebusters, called <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40393\" href=\"/watchmen/4060-40393/\" slug=\"watchmen\">the Watchmen</a> in the film. He never speaks a line.</p>",

He is the brother of <a href=\"/itachi/4005-44260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44260\">Itachi</a> Uchiha. He spent some of his childhood with his family the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/uchiha-clan/4060-50974/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50974\">Uchiha Clan</a>, one of the village's most powerful clans. They have a special kekkei genkai called the <a href=\"/sharingan/4055-44263/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44263\">Sharingan</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4458261-9439582367-39906.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4458261\" data-ratio=\"1.4746543778802\" data-width=\"434\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 434px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4458261-9439582367-39906.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4458261\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4458261-9439582367-39906.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4458261-9439582367-39906.jpg 434w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px\" data-width=\"434\"></a></figure><p>As a child, he was neglected by his father because he liked Itachi more. But Sasuke's mom did the exact opposite she treated them both the same and all Sasuke wanted to do was impress his father so he would notice him. His brother Itachi was suspected that he killed his friend <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/shisui-uchiha/4005-79522/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79522\">Shisui Uchiha</a> and was visited by the Uchiha clan members He defeated them but was stopped by his father. Days later when Sasuke was coming home from the academy only to find out his brother had killed off the whole clan. Itachi killed everyone to test his own ability as a shinobi. He left Sasuke alive because he didn't think he was worth killing at the time he viewed Sasuke as pathetic.He told Sasuke to fill yourself with hatred and grow more power to one day kill him and avenge the Uchiha clan. He continued on after the incident with Itachi's words imprinted in his mind.</p><p>Sasuke named himself an avenger at this point. Sometime later he was paired up with his team mates. The first meeting with Naruto Uzumaki was somewhat of a clumsy one, as he could not stand the kid, but, seeing as they were in the same class, he would have to deal with him. Sasuke was the point of many of the kunoichi's affections in the class, but mostly Sakura Haruno and Ino Yamanaka, and, Naruto wanted Sakura, when she wanted nothing to do with him. Sasuke, however, did not think anything of these crushes and would continue on with his day every time someone would bring it up, even telling many of the girls to just back off to their faces. To his own dismay, he found that this tactic rarely worked for anything, as the very next day they would decide that they could always try a different approach.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127463\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127463-130082-team-7.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.852\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:85.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127463-130082-team-7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127463\"><img alt=\"Sakura, Naruto, and Sasuke - Team 7\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127463-130082-team-7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127463-130082-team-7.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>Sakura, Naruto, and Sasuke - Team 7</figcaption></figure><p>Their first encounter, Naruto saw the acclaimed prodigy of their junior class Sasuke, and stood up on the table and stared him down, eye to eye. Sasuke, as usual, had just been sitting there with his hands propped up by his elbows, staring forward with his chin and head propped up by his hands. Naruto stared him down, and, in a most embarrassing moment the kid in front of them knocked Naruto and caused their lips to meet, almost a seeming kiss. The two boys spat and wiped their faces off for a long period of time, and from then on out Sasuke decided that he wouldn't even deal with him anymore, and that he was nothing more than an immature kid who strove to become a ninja. Alas, though he did not want it, Sasuke was paired Naruto, and Sakura. The real problem wasn't Naruto in the end, though, it was Sakura, who had a huge crush on him that he did not want to be a part of. It made him angry that simply for that Naruto would want to be his rival....</p><p>And so, Sasuke was drafted with <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\">Naruto</a> and <a href=\"/sakura/4005-44242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44242\">Sakura</a> on <a href=\"/team-7/4060-44283/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44283\">Team 7</a>, lead by the copy-ninja <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a>. The first test that he had with his new sensei Kakashi was to retrieve one or two of the bells that he had on him at the time, but, the problem was, that for three members he only had two bells, and the person that went without a bell would have to go without lunch. Sasuke managed to fight him and almost get a bell, making it so that even the great Kakashi could not read his book while attempting to fend him off.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127847\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127847-49828-kakashi.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.98684210526316\" data-width=\"380\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 380px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127847-49828-kakashi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127847\"><img alt=\"Sasuke's first mentor, Kakashi Hatake, the Copy Cat Ninja\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" data-width=\"380\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127847-49828-kakashi.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127847-49828-kakashi.jpg 380w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sasuke's first mentor, Kakashi Hatake, the Copy Cat Ninja\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127847-49828-kakashi.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127847-49828-kakashi.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" data-width=\"380\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sasuke's first mentor, Kakashi Hatake, the Copy Cat Ninja</figcaption></figure><p>He originally hid with Sakura, waiting for Naruto, who had tried a direct frontal assault as his primary tactic, to finish up and be worn out. When he assumed that Kakashi was not prepared, he went in with all out Taijutsu to defeat the esteemed Jonin. However, it did not work and he was left defeated and sealed underground by Kakashi's genjutsu and ninjutsu. In the end, however, he was given lunch anyways due to Naruto's foolish actions and attempts to cheat.</p><p>Sasuke and Sakura ate their lunches in front of a chained up Naruto. To Naruto's dismay, and were told that they were not allowed to give Naruto any of their lunches by Kakashi. Their sensei left and he decided that he would still share with Naruto, though he had been advised against it. Sakura was confused and thought that he was being stupid, and didn't want for him to fail any test that she passed, as she wanted to be with him. Kakashi reappeared and with an angered look in his face he screamed at Sasuke and Sakura for breaking the rules, telling them that he had deliberately told them what they should not have done, and now that they had done it....they passed. The three ninja were extremely surprised to hear something like this as their master seemed quite angry. Then he told them: <em>\"Yes, in the Ninja world, those that would break the rules are scum. But those who forget their friends are less than scum.\"</em></p><p>The phrase didn't mean much to Sasuke yet, but later, it would mean nearly everything.</p><p> </p><h3>Hidden Mist Ninja</h3><p>His first major mission was escorting an architect and bridge expert, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tazuna/4005-90872/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90872\">Tazuna</a>, to his home in the poverty-stricken Wave Country. When they went to receive the mission from <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/third-hokage/4005-44513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44513\">Lord Hokage the Third</a>, they were given a C-Rank mission, though they were, in fact, pulling themselves into a spot where they would no longer be able to play around. Little did they know, they were going after <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/zabuza-momochi/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\">Zabuza Momochi</a> himself, a man known as \"The Demon\", and they would be fighting him in order to survive, not only save the Bridge Builder. Later on in the same mission, during an exercise to improve tree climbing, he managed to stay ahead of Naruto for a good length of time. He also stood toe to toe for a while with <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/haku/4005-44244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44244\">Haku</a>, an exceptionally dangerous ninja with extreme speed and dexterity.</p><p>It was during this battle that Sasuke awakened the legacy of his clan, the Sharingan. However, in order for him to do this, he ended up nearly dying to save Naruto, who had intruded on his fight. Their first encounter on the mission with Zabuza was a very dangerous fight as it had been a complete ambush, and they had just defeated two other lowly ninja on their own. Sasuke and Naruto were forced to fight off one of Zabuza's water clones while the real Zabuza held off Kakashi, imprisoning him in a water ball like jutsu, that made him completely immobilized as long as Zabuza held him there with his chakra. Naruto was foolish in thinking that he could still take out one of the clones with one of his barrage like attacks, and ended up being nearly killed when he ganged up on the masked murderer. However, all hope was not lost, Sasuke still conjured a plan, and one that was successful, too. He had Naruto transform into a shuriken, and then threw him while underneath one of his own shuriken.</p><p>Zabuza dodged the shuriken with ease by catching the first and jumping over the other, but the one that he had been forced to let by him was actually the one he should have payed attention too the most, as it was the one that Naruto had conjured himself to be. He threw a kunai straight into Zabuza's face, and made him lose concentration and release Kakashi. The fight from then on out was basically won, until a mysterious young ninja killed Zabuza... or so they thought. Kakashi passed out shortly after the fight, and the three young genin and the old bridge maker Tazuna carried him onward to Tazuna's place, where they would recuperate and meet Tazuna's grandson <a href=\"/inari/4005-44370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44370\">Inari,</a> a young boy who, though at first seemed snobby, but once the young genin learned his past from his mother, who also stayed with her father Tazuna.</p><p>Inari had been a young boy when he met a man that he viewed as a hero, and saw him as a father figure, as his was long gone from his life. This man was a rebel figure in every sense of the word, and somewhat of a hero for the small village that Inari had lived in, and had even saved him from drowning on one occasion. However, due to him doing certain things that made Gato lose money, he was forced to be executed by many of the evil crime lords men. This made the others see the little boy in a different light, and try to be nicer to him, but he continued to simply be a seeming snob, wanting to be left alone to cry for some of the things he knew were happening to him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-244223\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9804/244223-101664-zabuza.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.74486803519062\" data-width=\"341\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 341px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9804/244223-101664-zabuza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-244223\"><img alt=\"Zabuza, the Demon of the hidden mist.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" data-width=\"341\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9804/244223-101664-zabuza.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9804/244223-101664-zabuza.jpg 341w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Zabuza, the Demon of the hidden mist.\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9804/244223-101664-zabuza.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9804/244223-101664-zabuza.jpg 341w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" data-width=\"341\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zabuza, the Demon of the hidden mist.</figcaption></figure><p>Sasuke and Naruto didn't know what to say to little Inari so the two young genin just minded their own business. After waiting quite a while for their sensei to fully heal he told them that he knew that something wasn't right...after discussing the options the young group realized that the young boy who had killed Zabuza had possibly not killed him, but taken him away to save him from being killed by Kakashi. After realizing this, the genin were all taken out to learn some more of the fundamentals and basics of chakra manipulation by doing one thing, walking, or running, up trees.</p><p>Sasuke and Naruto didn't understand how this would help their combat prowess, but they quickly changed their minds when they were explained the purpose of training this way, in order to strengthen the way that they were able to manipulate their chakra to do just about everything. After months of training, him and Naruto were finally what he considered him to be an \"equal.\"</p><p>However, the time came when Kakashi revealed that in actuality Zabuza was not dead, due to the way the shifty tracker ninja had acted when coming to dispose of the body. Squad Seven eventually left and went on to face Zabuza once more, this time showing his new found speed and defeating multiple of Zabuza's water clones and facing off against Haku in his water crystal barrier. The fight went on and eventually Naruto came to rescue Sasuke, albeit only ending up in making this situation much more difficult by getting them both trapped in the barrier. It was here that Sasuke revealed his dormant Sharingan eyes, and was able to see Haku's movements, but not stop them. He ended up taking what seemed to be a fatal blow for Naruto, causing much speculation as to how he lived.</p><h3>Chuunin Exams</h3><p>For the first part of the Chunin exams everyone had to take a test. It was a hard test in which you couldn't cheat. If you did you along with your team would have to leave Along with other people Sasuke cheated. He used his Sharingan to copy the movements of a person to get their answers. Before the tenth question was given you had the option to leave and you could take the exams again. But if you stay and you answer wrong, you can never to the Chunin Exams again. With Naruto's determination and encouraging words to stay for the tenth question Sasuke and Sakura along with many other people stayed for the question and passed.</p><p>In the second part of the Chunin exams the team had to retrieve a scroll out of two. One was the Earth scroll while the other was the Heaven scroll In the forest he faced an unknown opponent who was <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a> disguised, that overpowered the whole team left by leaving Sasuke with an odd marking on his neck and shoulder area. He left, saying his name was Orochimaru.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-265389\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/265389-186934-orochimaru.gif\" data-ratio=\"0.7275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/265389-186934-orochimaru.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-265389\"><img alt=\"Orochimaru\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/265389-186934-orochimaru.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/265389-186934-orochimaru.gif 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Orochimaru\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/265389-186934-orochimaru.gif\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/265389-186934-orochimaru.gif 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Orochimaru</figcaption></figure><p>Sasuke fell into a deadly, painful sleep. He was barely kept alive by the efforts of Sakura. However, as three Sound ninja closed in on them, Sasuke’s awakening brought a frightening turn, the mark grew, covering one side of his body in a black flame pattern and extraordinary power. In a matter of minutes, Sasuke moved into an avenger, yanking the arms out of the sockets of one attacker and scaring his teammates off. The power he now commanded over even went as far as to make Sakura afraid, begging him to stop.</p><p>In the preliminary exams, he had to fight a rain ninja. After the fight Kakashi sealed the mark with a seal but it would only work by will.</p><p>After this Kakshi trains Sasuke for his fight in the finals against <a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\">Gaara</a> of the Desert. He trained him with a jutsu called the Chidori.</p><p>In the finals of the Chunin Exams he arrived at the last second in the middle of the arena.</p><p>Gaara enclosed himself into a protect shell made of sand. Because of this Sasuke had to use the Chidori. When he penetrated the shell, for the first time in his life Gaara has seen his own blood. This made the already unstable Gaara even more unstable and his siblings carried Gaara away. Sasuke chased them as an invasion of Sound ninja and Sand ninja came in. After a fight with his sister <a href=\"/temari/4005-45076/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45076\">Temari</a> he went after the two brothers. When he met up with <a href=\"/kankuro/4005-45099/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45099\">Kankuro</a> and Gaara, Gaara left while Kankuro stayed.</p><p>Then <a href=\"/shino/4005-44281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44281\">Shino</a> showed up, wanting to have his match against Kankuro that was supposed to happen in the finals. Sasuke then goes after Gaara. Gaara was more of a monster than Sasuke could handle and used the curse mark just to keep up with him. Naruto came in, just as the curse mark made Sasuke unable to move.</p><p>As Sasuke is recovering he is frustrated at how strong Naruto is. Later on they both have a battle on a rooftop. After Sasuke jumps into the air he uses the Chidori. Naruto creates a Rasengan and lunges at Sasuke. Sakura tries to stop them but it is too late. Neither of them can move and as they are about to hit each other. Kakashi throws them into separate water tanks both making holes, Sasuke's Chidori made a hole, and Naruto's Rasengan made a hole.</p><p>As Sasuke walks around he sees that a much bigger hole was made by Naruto in the back of the tank. Later Sasuke is approached by the Sound Four to join Orochimaru so he could be trained by him. He accepts.</p><p>He did many missions but left the Leaf Village to go to the Sound Village and train with Orochimaru get stronger.</p><p> </p><h2>Naruto: Shippūden</h2><p>In Naruto: Shippūden, which takes place two years after the first Naruto series, Sasuke is now sixteen. During this time he has trained under Orochimaru, and his lust for strength is still strong. During his first encounter with Sakura and Naruto he claims that he is willing to give up his body to Orochimaru just to kill Itachi. This would be proven wrong when Sasuke barged into Orochimaru's room and pinned him to the wall.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4457709\" data-ratio=\"1.65\" data-width=\"620\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 620px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:165.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4457709\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px\" data-width=\"387\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal 620w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal 581w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal 387w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal 620w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal 581w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11121/111213729/4457709-8859111324-40.png%7Eoriginal 387w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px\" data-width=\"387\"></noscript></a></figure><p>He then declares to Orochimaru that he is weak and there was nothing more he could teach him, and was prepared to strike the death blow when Orochimaru turned into his true form, a white snake made up of hundreds of smaller white snakes like itself, somewhat of a beast like Hydra. The two fight, with all the snakes on Orochimaru's \"body\" attacking simultaneously. Sasuke defended himself against the attacks and taunted Orochimaru as he activated his level two Curse Seal. He said \"snakes dream of soaring through the sky, but are forever doomed to crawl on their bellies. But you'll get your chance to fly, snake... in the talons of a hawk.\" Sasuke then slices Orochimaru in three halves, but starts to feel sick. Orochimaru's severed head taunts Sasuke, saying that his snakes have poisoned the air, as he lunges at him trying to take Sasuke's body by bringing them both to something of a dimension \"within himself,\" as Orochimaru put it.</p><p>Sasuke began to be consumed by the strange organic-like material within that world, but Sasuke put Orochimaru in a genjutsu and the strange material that was consuming Sasuke instead began to consume Orochimaru... absorbing Orochimaru with his own technique. When Kabuto asked him which one he was, Sasuke put Kabuto in a genjutsu showing him what happened, then said simply \"I've taken over.\" Sasuke then forms a team called Hebi, which means Serpent or Snake, made up of four people including himself. The three other members consisted of other subordinates of Orochimaru from his other hideouts. They were: Suigetsu, Karin, and Juugo. This team was made to kill Itachi. With Hebi, Sasuke traveled to confront Itachi but was intercepted by the Akatsuki member Deidara. Deidara challenged Sasuke and was ultimately defeated by his own clay bomb, \"his greatest masterpiece\" as he called it. However, the large summon snake Manda was killed in the battle and Sasuke was left wounded. Recently Sasuke has caught up with Itachi.</p><p>When he found him Itachi told Sasuke to meet him in the old Uchiha hideout. When Sasuke and his team, Hebi (Snake), made it to the hideout they were confronted by Itachi's Akatsuki partner Kisame. Kisame told Sasuke to go on alone while the other three stay behind. Karin pleaded for Sasuke not to go alone but Sasuke thought this was perfect and went on ahead. Meanwhile Suigetsu and Kisame have decided to battle to pass the time, seeing is how they're both from the Village hidden in the Mist. When Sasuke finally confronted Itachi for their final battle he found Itachi sitting on a throne like chair. Itachi asked Sasuke \"What do you see?\", in which Sasuke un-fearfully answered \"I see you...dead.\". The battle began with Itachi finally replying \"Let's see how good your eyesight is.\". Sasuke used his Chidori Current and pinned Itachi down.</p><p>Sasuke told Itachi he had one question left to ask before he kills him. But it was revealed the Itachi was using his signature genjutsu as the Itachi pinned down faded away as a flock of Raven's. Sasuke found the real Itachi still sitting atop the Uchiha throne. Itachi was surprised when Sasuke was actually using a genjutsu as well as Sasuke's body faded away as a herd of snakes. The real Sasuke was hiding behind the throne.</p><p>He impaled Itachi from behind with his sword. Sasuke then told Itachi once more \"Before I kill you, I have one last question.\". Sasuke asked Itachi who the third Uchiha survivor was, and Itachi answered \"Uchiha Madara\". Sasuke wondered how Madara could still be alive if he was a founding father of the Leaf Village. Itachi told him that Madara is very much alive. And that Madara helped Itachi kill the Uchiha clan. Sasuke then revealed that Itachi was using genjutsu and now they may begin they're real fight. But before they did, Itachi revealed that after activating the Mangekyou Sharingan, your eyes slowly begin to go blind, the very price you have to pay for getting the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox. Itachi told Sasuke that Madara Uchiha is the only one in history to ever find out the Sharingan's final secret, and with it he tamed the nine-tailed fox, and used like a pet.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5189100-9207673306-sasuk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5189100\" data-ratio=\"0.58055555555556\" data-width=\"720\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.1%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5189100-9207673306-sasuk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5189100\"><img alt=\"The final fight between brothers.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5189100-9207673306-sasuk.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5189100-9207673306-sasuk.jpg 720w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5189100-9207673306-sasuk.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The final fight between brothers.\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5189100-9207673306-sasuk.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5189100-9207673306-sasuk.jpg 720w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5189100-9207673306-sasuk.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The final fight between brothers.</figcaption></figure><p>However this was revealed to be genjutsu. Then Itachi used the Tsukoyomi to tell Sasuke his sinister plan to rip out Sasuke's eyes. Sasuke broke the genjutsu of Tsukoyomi and proceeded to attack and successfully overwhelm Itachi's Grand Fireball jutsu, but soon after Itachi uses his Amaterasu flame to attack Sasuke.</p><p>Sasuke was able to dodge Amaterasu with a technique of Orochimaru's which uses alot of his chakra. Both being near the end of chakra Sasuke prepares for his final jutsu, \"Kirin.\"</p><p>By creating a hot up-draft, Sasuke was able to cause storm clouds to form. Using his chakra, he guided a lightning bolt at Itachi. He thought he defeated Itachi, however Itachi used his last Mangekyou Sharingan technique, Susanoo, a large humanoid to protect himself. Orochimaru starts to whisper to Sasuke, saying that he can help him defeat Itachi. White snakes then appear from Sasuke's body and Orochimaru appears in the form of a gigantic eight-headed snake and attacks Itachi, however Susanoo cuts off each head that attacks him. Orochimaru emerges from the mouth of the last head and is stabbed by Susanoo's sword, which has the power to seal whatever it strikes in a dream-like world. Susanoo starts to absorb Orochimaru and the white snakes from Sasuke's body into a gourd attached to the sword, but one of the snakes escape.</p><p>Itachi begins towards Sasuke, but clenches his chest.Sasuke attempts to defend himself with exploding kunais, however they are all deflected by Susanoo's shield. Sasuke gets backed into a corner as Itachi reaches for Sasuke's eyes, but at the last moment changes his finger's path and pokes Sasuke's forehead as he falls to the ground and Susanoo disappears, in a last act of remembrance.</p><p>Sasuke then awakens in a darkened bedroom. Tobi first speaks and informs Sasuke that he won, but shouldn't be so careless about his life. He then stepped out of the shadows and tells him that that they met before, but he isn't his enemy. Tobi then starts to take off his mask, stating that he's also a surviving Uchiha. At this point, Sasuke's eye turns into the Itachi's Mangekyou Sharingan and Amaterasu starts to engulf Tobi, he falls back into the shadows screaming. Sasuke is baffled as to what happened, and Tobi steps out of the shadows saying that Itachi gave him his Mangekyou Sharingan, possibly as a last ditch effort to kill him or to keep him away from Sasuke. Tobi makes a joke saying that it could be called a fail-safe, but Itachi only got as far as \"fail.\" He then tells Sasuke that he was the one that helped Itachi destroy the Uchiha clan and called himself Madara, and said that he's going to tell Sasuke about Itachi...</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5189112-1609206485-44500.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5189112\" data-ratio=\"0.50901525658807\" data-width=\"721\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 721px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.9%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5189112-1609206485-44500.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5189112\"><img alt=\"Sasuke learns the truth about Itachi.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5189112-1609206485-44500.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5189112-1609206485-44500.jpg 721w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5189112-1609206485-44500.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sasuke learns the truth about Itachi.\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5189112-1609206485-44500.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5189112-1609206485-44500.jpg 721w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5189112-1609206485-44500.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sasuke learns the truth about Itachi.</figcaption></figure><p>The first few things he said confused Sasuke a lot, as he didn't understand the relevance of what had happened back then to what was happening now. Tobi told him that in order for him to explain the past of Uchiha Itachi, he would have to first explain what had happened a long time ago, back before Konoha had even technically started, back when there were two warring clans, The Uchiha and the Senju clan, who had been warring with eachother ever since anyone could remember. When people hired the Uchiha as bodyguards, their enemy would hire the Senju. The two clans were the strongest in the world, and always fought whenever they were given the chance. Tobi continued to tell him of how he had met his greatest rival, and also the man he had looked up to the most, on these battlefields. This man was known as <a href=\"/the-first-hokage/4005-49812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49812\">Hashirama Senju</a>, the man who would later become the first Hokage of the Leaf Village. Madara continued to tell Sasuke that he had been on even terms with the man when it came to fighting, they were almost on equal terms with eachother, but Tobi had lost more than he'd won, and eventually this caused for him to have to give up his position in the clan, as in desperation he asked his little brother for his eyes, as he was going blind. What most people did not know if this story was that in fact, Madara had not taken his brothers eyes away, he had in fact just accepted the offer because he knew that his little brother knew what was best for the clan. But this would eventually cause some controversy among the other members, and he would soon lose rank...</p><p>Standing on a bank of a ocean shore Sasuke reflected on what Tobi told him, then in a final decision he informed Tobi, Juugo, Karin, and Suigetsu. That team Hebi (snake) will now move under the name Taka (hawk) also reviling his new Mangekyou Sharingan, and long with the new name came a new goal, to crush Konoha.</p><p>But, before he would crush Konoha, Tobi said that he would have to join him with the remainder of the Akatsuki, and so, he did. There current primary goal is to capture the eight tailed biju, who has identified himself as \" <a href=\"/killer-bee/4005-56686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56686\">Killer bee</a>\", and acts some what like a stereotypical African-American rapper.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-520572\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/520572-79.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"459\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 459px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/520572-79.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-520572\"><img alt=\"On a Rampage\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/520572-79.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/520572-79.jpg 459w\"><noscript><img alt=\"On a Rampage\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/520572-79.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/520572-79.jpg 459w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>On a Rampage</figcaption></figure><p>Sasuke and his team find Killer Bee in the mountains of the Cloud village. Suigetsu and Juugo begin the assault, but are easily defeated. Sasuke confidently steps in but fares no better and is heavily wounded, but saved by the combined efforts of his teammates. Karin heals Sasuke and the team begin their attack again, this time as a team, and are still not doing so well. Killer Bee then uses his Bijuu chakra and attacks Sasuke, whom manages to avoid a tackle and Killer Bee heads towards the others. They escape and Killer Bee goes back for Sasuke, that's when Sasuke manages to hit Killer Bee with Tsukiyomi but he breaks it as the eight-tailed beast was able to disrupt his chakra and dispel the genjutsu.He tackles Sasuke after sasuke lowered his guard, gravely injuring him again. Juugo tries to patch up Sasuke while Killer Bee assumes his Bijuu's form and Suigetsu tries to hold him off for the others to escape with a giant wave, but Killer Bee takes Suigetsu down and Sasuke then prepared to use Amaterasu. Killer Bee began flailing about while on fire, in the process he caught Karin on fire too before he passed out. Sasuke then used his MS again to extinguish the flames on both Killer Bee and Karin, but using his MS too much had caused Sasuke incredible pain. He and Juugo then carried they Killer Bee and their teammates back to their base.</p><p>Uknown to Sasuke and his team, they have actually failed to capture the 8-Tails and are returning with a Clone. Carrying the clone without notice as well as their wounded teammates, Sasuke and Jugo traveled to another Akatsuki hideout, where he handed over the clone to Madara. Madara asked him where he intended to go next. Sasuke replied that after healing his injuries, he would go to Konoha. At this, Madara remembered a conversation he had with Sasuke before the latter left to capture the Eight-Tails. Madara was skeptical about Sasuke's stated intention to crush Konoha (which would go against Itachi's wishes) and questioned his motives. At this, Sasuke said that although he wanted to respect Itachi's sacrifice, his feelings of anger and sorrow at Itachi's fate were much greater. He further said that he considered Itachi's life to have been more important than Konoha in the same way Itachi felt about him, and because of that he could never forgive the three Konoha elders for their actions. He then revealed that he had lied when he said he only wanted to kill the three elders and that he instead wanted to destroy the entire village, whom he considered accomplices for going along with the Senju's discrimination of the Uchiha, and for enjoying a temporary \"peace\" at the cost of Itachi's life and the massacre of the Uchiha clan. Thus, he made it clear that he had no intention of following in Itachi's footsteps, to which Madara remained silent. Madara thought to himself, \"In all those who feel love, there lies the capacity for hate\".</p><p>As his team rested, Suigetsu asked Sasuke if they would really get the power of the Eight-Tails, but Sasuke surmised that he doesn't need it. He then thought to himself that he already has the power to destroy Konoha (with his Mangekyo Sharingan) and reached for a glass of water. Much to his surprise, Sasuke accidentally knocked over the glass. In horror, he realized that his eyesight has gotten hazy. Karin asked him if he is all right, to which Sasuke lies, telling her that nothing was wrong.</p><p>Suddenly, Karin sensed an enemy outside their base and Sasuke and Jugo went to intercept him. This enemy turned out to be a spy sent by the <a href=\"/fourth-raikage/4005-67911/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67911\">Raikage</a> to keep tabs on Hawk's movements. Later, other Cloud ninjas sent by the Raikage arrive, only to find that Team Hawk were gone and the spy (apparently) dead.</p><p>Afterwards, it was revealed that Sasuke actually failed in capturing the Eight-Tails, as Killer Bee fooled him into taking a tail of the Eight-Tails disguised as his body, instead of the beast itself.</p><p>Madara later intercepted Team Hawk whom were off to make their offensive against Konoha. Team Hawk said they were parting with Akatsuki, but Madara told Sasuke that he warned Sasuke that he'd kill him if he betrayed Akatsuki, adding on that the Eight-Tails was a fake. Madara told them that he'll let their failure to capture the Eight-Tails slide and he wants them to do something else before they can leave Akatsuki. Sasuke tried to attack Madara, but failed. Madara told him that there was no point in destroying Konoha since Pein already did it, and told them that the 5 Kages were going to have a meeting... one of them being Danzo, who wanted the Uchiha wiped out. He then had Zetsu lead Team Hawk to the Kage meeting; Zetsu split in two and the light half lead them while the dark half remained with Madara.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-948485\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.605\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-948485\"><img alt=\"Sasuke vs. Raikage\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg 600w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sasuke vs. Raikage\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg 600w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/948485-sasuke_vr_raikage_by_goldenhans.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sasuke vs. Raikage</figcaption></figure><p>L. Zetsu took them to the Land of Iron, a snow-covered country that had Samurai rather than Ninja. Team Hawk scouted the area and managed to sneak into the Kage meeting where L. Zetsu informed them which one was Danzo. After Team Hawk snuck out, they decided upon a course of action, they'd attack Danzo while he's on his way back to the Leaf village. This however doesn't go according to plan as Madara tells L. Zetsu to tell the Kages that Sasuke's there. L. Zetsu pops up in the middle of the Kage meeting, telling them that Sasuke's hiding somewhere and wants them to go find him. Raikage rushes L. Zetsu and threatens to kill him if he doesn't tell them where Sasuke is, L. Zetsu offers to give him a hint but Raikage apparently kills him out of frustration and runs off with his bodyguards Shii and Darui to look for Sasuke. Raikage does find Sasuke, Sasuke rushes head-on but Darui defends with Water Encampment Wall to force Sasuke back, then uses an electrical attack called Wave of Inspiration to attack, but Sasuke's able to escape. Shii then uses a genjutsu on Sasuke, stunning him while Darui and Raiakge go in to kill Sasuke, but Juugo and Suigetsu save Sasuke... unfortunately Suigetsu's sword is broke in two from Raikage's punch. Juugo uses his full cursed form and Raikage slams him against a wall with a thunderous punch, but Juugo endures it with a shield and fires a large energy blast at Raikage, but he dodges and slam Juugo against another wall which takes him out of the fight. Sasuke tries to attack Raikage from behind, but Raikage knocks Sasuke's sword from his hand. Sasuke then uses Chidori and rushes at Raikage. They charge at each other, Sasuke manages to avoid Raikage's attack and hit him with Chidori, however Raikage is too durable and only Sasuke's fingertips pierce him. Raikage then gives Sasuke a powerbomb, but Sasuke saves himself from any serious damage with Susanoo. Sasuke then tries to use Amaterasu, but Raikage uses Body Flicker to avoid it and goes to attack Sasuke again, Sasuke however uses Amaterasu to cover Susanoo but Raikage ignores it and strikes anyway, thrusting Sasuke into the ground.

Sasuke's Susanoo starts to fully form and everyone launches projectiles, but Susanoo swings his sword and causes the building to collapse on them and flees with Karin to find Danzo. As Sasuke enters the Kage's meeting room, Danzo uses the confusion to escape while Ao, one of the Mizukage's bodyguards, tries to catch him. Sasuke is about to chase after, but the Mizukage stops him by using her blood-line limit, lava, to seal the door shut. She then uses her lava again, using the technique Melting Apparition to try to kill Sasuke, but Sasuke once again uses Susanoo to try to protect himself. Mizukage's other bodyguard, Choujiro, attacks and crashes Sasuke through a wall where Mizukage traps him and herself in. She then uses her other blood-line limit, Skilled Mist, to fill the area with acidic vapor which starts to melt Susanoo's bones and Sasuke himself. L.Zetsu however saves Sasuke, he secretly used his Spore technique to drain everyone's chakra and gives it to Sasuke, but he doesn't collect much since everyone escapes from his technique.

Danzo reappeared unharmed, at which point Sasuke turned into crows and reformed near Danzo as Itachi.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1108816\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1108816-sasuke_vs_danzou___478_08_09_by_nminato.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2405660377358\" data-width=\"424\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 424px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1108816-sasuke_vs_danzou___478_08_09_by_nminato.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1108816\"><img alt=\"Susanoo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px\" data-width=\"515\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1108816-sasuke_vs_danzou___478_08_09_by_nminato.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1108816-sasuke_vs_danzou___478_08_09_by_nminato.jpg 424w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Susanoo\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1108816-sasuke_vs_danzou___478_08_09_by_nminato.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1108816-sasuke_vs_danzou___478_08_09_by_nminato.jpg 424w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px\" data-width=\"515\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Susanoo</figcaption></figure><p>Itachi used Amaterasu, but it was actually Sasuke's Tsukiyomi and Danzo broke it and paralyzed Sasuke before he could stab him. Danzo placed his paralyzing seal on Sasuke when he grabbed his neck. Karin tried to help Sasuke, but Danzo kicked her away and was about to kill Sasuke when Sasuke used Susanoo to save himself, knocking Danzo away. Sasuke was able to overpower Danzo's seal and was about to use Susanoo's bow &amp; arrow to kill Danzo, but Danzo created a tree to save himself. Susanoo shot another arrow, but Danzo was able to use his jutsu, Izanagi, to resurrect himself again. It's explained that Izanagi blurs reality and illusion, and that for 60 seconds, Danzo is invincible because any injury or death caused will be changed into an illusion; but after which the Sharingan eye can no longer be used. Susanoo shoots another arrow at Danzo but he revives himself and uses Great Vacuum Jewel, but Susanoo blocks it with it's shield/bow. Danzo summons a Baku and it begins to try to suck in Susanoo, Susanoo braces itself though. Danzo appears from behind and blasts Susanoo's back with Vacuum Serial Waves which creates an opening in Susanoo's back and Danzo goes to attack Sasuke, but Sasuke shoots a Grand Fireball at the Baku which makes it gag and Susanoo punches Danzo away. Sasuke's no longer able to sustain Susanoo and it disappears, the two then grab their weapons and attack: Sasuke charges his sword with lightning and Danzo creates a sword of wind, and they stabbed each other.</p><p>Danzo had planned on sacrificing the last Sharingan on his arm in order to kill Sasuke, however his last eye had already ran out of time and Sasuke used a genjutsu to trick Danzo into thinking it was still open. Sasuke however was just fatally wounded as Danzo and Karin rushed to heal him, while this was going on Hashirama's D.N.A. was starting to overwhelm Danzo and his right arm grew into a tree, Danzo was able to break himself away before it grew around him; Shisui's Sharingan however was working again and Danzo took off his bandages. Sasuke attacked with Chidori, but Danzo dodged it and grabbed Karin to use her as a shield. Danzo was trying to figure out if he should sacrifice Shisui's Sharingan for Izanagi or use it's mind control in a last-ditch effort to kill Sasuke. Sasuke told Karin not to move and used Chidori Spear, impaling Danzo and Karin. Karin asked why, and Sasuke replied that she became a burden when she was captured. Danzo let Karin's body fall and started to walk away, with Sasuke stalking him, but Madara jumped infront of Danzo and said he'll be taking Shisui's eye. Danzo decided to sacrifice himself to stop Madara and Sasuke instead of trying to survive; he activated the Reverse Four Symbols Seal, creating a vacuum that sucks in everything around him and seals them inside his body. However Madara and Sasuke were able to get to safety.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336993\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.56125\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336993\"><img alt=\"The Madness\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg 800w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Madness\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg 800w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120635/2336993-604075108.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Madness</figcaption></figure><p>Madara took Danzo's body to retrieve Shisui's Sharingan, but before he left he told Sasuke that he should finish off Karin so she couldn't fall into enemy hands in her condition. Sasuke was about to do this when Sakura appeared, offering to ally with Sasuke. He saw it as a chance to replace Karin as his medic, and said that he'd let her join him if she proved her intentions by killing Karin. Sakura walked up to Karin and was thinking about attacking Sasuke instead, however Sasuke was about to kill her from behind with a Chidori; but Kakashi sprung out and saved her. He tried to reason with Sasuke, but Sasuke was infuriated that Konoha was so happy due to Itachi's and his clan's demises aswell as the fact that Kakashi has a Sharingan which should only belong to an Uchiha. In his rage, Sasuke used Susanoo and fired an arrow at Kakashi, but he stopped it with his Kamui- the sight of Kakashi's Mangekyou Sharingan only helped to anger Sasuke and his Susanoo changed forms again to look like Itachi's, however Susanoo disappeared and Sasuke was left nearly completely blind. Sakura ran up on Sasuke and was about to stab him but hesitated and Sasuke was about to stab her in retaliation, but Naruto appeared and saved Sakura. Naruto tried again to reason with Sasuke, but he failed again aswell. The two clashed and were both knocked away, White Zetsu appeared and saved Sasuke from crashing into rocks. Zetsu signaled for Madara whom appeared to get Sasuke out of there. When they got back to their hideout Sasuke decided to have Madara implant Itachi's eyes into his own so he can fight Naruto at full power.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1989789\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1989789-newsusanoo.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2653562653563\" data-width=\"407\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 407px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1989789-newsusanoo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1989789\"><img alt=\"Karasu Susanoo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" data-width=\"505\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1989789-newsusanoo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1989789-newsusanoo.jpg 407w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Karasu Susanoo\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1989789-newsusanoo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1989789-newsusanoo.jpg 407w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" data-width=\"505\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Karasu Susanoo</figcaption></figure><p>Later we see Sasuke with bandages covering his eyes, he states that he can feel Itachi's power flowing through him.

He is able to copy taijutsu and ninjutsu using his sharingan, as demonstrated when he copied Rock Lee's taijutsu. However, he is not able to perform to the extent that Rock Lee could and tires more easily as he has not trained as hard as Rock Lee, he also cannot copy other kekkei genkai nor summonings, and cannot copy elements that he cannot use. The Sharingan can cast genjutsu by making eye contact to fool his opponents. It also allows Sasuke to track his opponent by seeing their chakra.

The kids used to bully Sakura for her large forehead, and when she began covering them, they took advantage of her sensitivity about it and teased her even more. Soon after, Sakura would befriend <a href=\"/ino/4005-44248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44248\">Yamanaka Ino</a>. Ino gave Sakura a ribbon to help show off her face more. Thanks to Ino, Sakura became more social and developed her own personality. Sakura and Ino became best friends throughout the academy. However, their friendship would take a turn when a boy named Uchiha Sasuke arrived at the academy. Sakura developed a crush on Sasuke, but would learn that Ino also had a crush on Sasuke. Their friendship ended and they became rivals. It was later revealed that the true reason for their strained relationship was that Sakura felt that she was only living in Ino's shadow and decided to become Ino's rival in order to step out on her own.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1308734\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67622/1308734-japnarutovol1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5652173913043\" data-width=\"230\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 230px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67622/1308734-japnarutovol1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1308734\"><img alt=\"Naruto Vol. 1 JPN (Mar 2000)\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67622/1308734-japnarutovol1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67622/1308734-japnarutovol1.jpg 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" data-width=\"230\"></a><figcaption>Naruto Vol. 1 JPN (Mar 2000)</figcaption></figure><p>Sakura Haruno (春野 サクラ, Haruno Sakura) is a lead character of the <em><a href=\"/naruto/4050-34585/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-34585\">Naruto</a></em> series that was created by <a href=\"/masashi-kishimoto/4040-50186/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-50186\">Masashi Kishimoto</a>.

This wasn't the case for the other male leads who were given more complicated designs. So much so that he was concerned about being able to draw the series every week. Shorts were added to her Chinese style of dress to give her a feel of being more active. The first design had them as long as past her knees but were brought up higher to mid-thigh. These became tighter and shorter as the series progressed. For her redesign after the two year time skip, Kishimoto wanted to give her a costume that reflected a more karate background that kept a Chinese design to keep a feminine feel. This is seen in her top.</p><p>In an interview with Kishimoto for <i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i> of June 2006, he said that she was the closest to being a normal person and would make the best ninja instructor of the Team 7 members. He also blamed his own lack of experience for not being able to draw her as looking \"cute\". Even his staff agreed she was \"far from cute\". He does imply that he felt she became cuter as the series went on and his skills improved. Her most prominent feature is her large forehead. He would occasionally overcompensate and draw it too large.</p><p>In a 2010 interview, he says he heard from those who worked with him, felt that <a href=\"/hinata-hyuga/4005-44280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44280\">Hinata Hyuga</a> would be a better fit as the heroine of the series, but he insists that Sakura is ultimately the heroine he created, and that he will strive to give Sakura more heroic scenes in the future.</p><blockquote><p>\" This was how I first imagined Sakura. Let's face it...she's really not that cute, is she? Especially back then! But that was mostly because I'm not that good with female characters in general, so making one of them cute is always a big challenge for me. \"</p><p>\" There's a lot more to being a good manga character than just cuteness, you know... At least, that's my excuse. The trouble makers and the curmudgeons I can draw without breaking a sweat....but girls are really hard. \"</p><p><b>Masashi Kishimoto</b></p><p><b><i>- \"Naruto\"</i> Volume 3 Early Character Designs - Sakura</b></p></blockquote><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2514268\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/122640/2514268-___________.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"2.9039301310044\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:290.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/122640/2514268-___________.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2514268\"><img alt=\"Sakura's post time skip design sketches\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122640/2514268-___________.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/122640/2514268-___________.jpg 229w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122640/2514268-___________.jpg 220w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sakura's post time skip design sketches\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122640/2514268-___________.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/122640/2514268-___________.jpg 229w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122640/2514268-___________.jpg 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sakura's post time skip design sketches</figcaption></figure><p>Despite Sakura's popularity, she was not intended to be the heroine of the series. Kishimoto blames himself for this by describing himself as being unable to draw a good heroine character type. The best he came up with for Sakura is a girl who couldn't understand men, who is an irritating character but always well intentioned. Still, he became quite fond of Sakura and feels much of her personality can be found in just about everyone. This is possibly one explanation as to why she is so easy to relate with for most readers.</p><p>After a two year time skip in the manga series, Sakura is now at 16 years old and reached the rank of Chunin. She was trained in all the skills and techniques of Tsunade and even has the same level of monstrous strength. No longer would she be playing the support role and was now a force to be feared in hand-to-hand combat. When Naruto returned, their first mission together was to save Gaara from the Akatsuki.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Introduction Arc</h3><p>Eventually it would be graduation day, but first all the students must take a pass or fail test. They would have to demonstrate their ability to make a <a href=\"/chakra/4015-46239/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46239\">chakra</a> clone of themselves, to which Sakura does and passes. She is now a Genin (lowest ninja rank) and would soon learn who her two teammates are. The next day, on her way to school she runs into Ino. The two immediately made it a competition to get to school faster. Sakura and Ino both wanted to be on Sasuke’s team, but only Sakura would be lucky enough. However, her other teammate was Naruto, who had a crush on Sakura. Sakura was now a part of <a href=\"/team-7/4060-44283/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44283\">Team 7</a> with Naruto and Sasuke, and their leader was <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a>. The team learns of a pass or fail survival test that Kakashi is going to administer. Kakashi briefs the team about it and tells them that it will not be easy.</p><p>The next day, they arrive at the training location with their ninja gear ready to go. However, Kakashi deliberately arrives hours late, and tells them that he “crossed a black cat and had to take a detour.” Kakashi shows them two bells and tells them that both only two, one, or none of them are going to pass, and the failure will return to the academy. When the test begins, Sakura showed more interest in following Sasuke around and ignore Naruto, despite him being in trouble. After this, Sakura was lectured by Kakashi for not helping Naruto, and she finally realized how serious this test was. Kakashi then ties Naruto up and gives Sakura and Sasuke food to eat. He then threatens them that if they allow Naruto to eat, they will fail immediately. However, Sasuke and Sakura defy Kakashi’s words and feed Naruto anyway. Kakshi shows up extremely angry and demands an explanation, Sakura tells Kakashi that they fed him because he was their teammate. Kakashi then reveals that they are the first team to pass his test, and now the team is ready for missions.</p><h3>Land of the Waves Arc</h3><p>Team 7 is assigned to protect a bridge builder named Tazuna, however their mission becomes a Class A ranked mission when they discover that a high ranked ninja was after him. Sakura suggested that they abandon the mission because it is ranked A and Naruto’s hand was injured. However, Naruto takes the kunai out of his hand and it begun healing rapidly. They decide to proceed with the mission anyways. Team 7 would run into a Hidden Mist village ninja named Zabuza. They discover that he is extremely powerful and they prepare before the confrontation. Sakura, due to her lack in ninja skills, was charged with protecting Tazuna, while the others fight Zabuza. However, Sakura would eventually head to the battlefield herself, where she discovers that she has amazing control over her own chakra. When Sasuke was appeared to have died in the battle, Sakura violates Shinobi Rule #25, by crying when Sasuke “died,” which states that a shinobi may never display any kind of emotion in the battlefield. Sasuke would eventually be revealed to not have really been dead, and Team 7 would accomplish their mission by defeating Zabuza, and protecting Tazuna the Bridge Builder.</p><h3>Chunin Exams Arc</h3><p>Once Team 7 returned to the Leaf Village, Sakura Haruno ran into members of the Sand Village in the city boundaries. Kakashi then surprised them that he was entering them into the Chūnin Exam. Sakura easily passed the written test given to them by Morino Ibiki, then they were led to the Forest of Death by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/anko-mitarashi/4005-50328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50328\">Anko Mitarashi</a>. It was in there that teams of three must find both a Heaven and Earth scroll before reaching the center. During the battles, Sasuke was attack and infected by <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a> with some cursed seal, and Naruto was unconscious. Rock Lee tried to come to Sakura's rescue when she was attacked by Sound Ninja as she was trying to protect her vulnerable team, but he was also defeated. She cut her own long hair to free herself, and she was aided in the fight by Ino's team.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5325035\" data-ratio=\"0.75625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.6%\" href=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5325035\"><img alt=\"Sakura cuts her hair to prove she's a changed kunoichi.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest 800w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sakura cuts her hair to prove she's a changed kunoichi.\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest 800w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11117/111173561/5325035-8190229682-latest 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sakura cuts her hair to prove she's a changed kunoichi.</figcaption></figure><p>After meeting with Kabuto, they made it to the center with both scrolls. With still too many competitors, there were several preliminary battles for the final test. Sakura was paired off against Ino. Ino nearly one their fight, but Sakura broke her possession jutsu with her will power. Their fight ended in a double-knock out (tie) that disqualified them both. However, this fight cleared up much of the tension between the two and started their renewed friendship.</p><h3>Invasion of Konoha Arc</h3><p>The final part of the tournament came to an abrupt end as the Sound and Sand Villages attacked during Sasuke's fight with <a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\">Gaara</a>. Sakura was given orders from Kakashi to follow after Sasuke with Naruto and <a href=\"/shikamaru-nara/4005-44247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44247\">Shikamaru</a>. Shikamaru stayed behind to lure away their pursuers, and found Sasuke battling Gaara, who was possessed by the One-Tailed Beast. During the fight, Sakura was captured in Gaara's sand and it threatened to crush her to death. When they returned, they discovered that the Third Hokage had been killed by Orochimaru, and the Sand Village had been tricked into the battle. Sakura went to visit Sasuke in the hospital, and she couldn't believe it when he told her that Naruto was the one who saved her.</p><h3>Search for Tsunade Arc</h3><p>With the Lord Hokage dead, a new leader was needed for the village. Sasuke was brought back to the village after being injured in a fight with his brother Itachi, and Naruto returned several days later with <a href=\"/fifth-hokage/4005-44512/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44512\">Tsunade</a>, one of the legendary Sannin, to be the Fifth Hokage. Sakura tried to stop Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry from coming to a head as they went all out at the top of the hospital. She was nearly killed as she tried to run between their powerful attacks, but she was saved by Kakashi flinging them both away.</p><h3>Sasuke Retrieval Arc</h3><p>Soon after the fight at the hospital, Sakura ran into Sasuke trying to leave the village to side with Orochimaru. At first she begged him to take her with him, but he knocked her unconscious when she threatened to scream. As soon as she was awake, she reported to Tsunade about his defection. She in turn put Naruto, Shikamaru, <a href=\"/choji-akimichi/4005-44249/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44249\">Choji</a>, and <a href=\"/kiba-inuzuka/4005-44279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44279\">Kiba</a> as the retrieval team. At the gate and with tears in her eyes, she pleaded with Naruto to bring Sasuke back, and he promised he would.</p><p>However, much of the team that had been sent out returned nearly dead, and Sasuke had tried to kill Naruto. Sakura tried to release Naruto from him promise, but he still held on to his word. The next time, Sakura agreed to be there to help him. As Naruto left to train with <a href=\"/jiraiya/4005-44511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44511\">Jiraiya</a>, Sakura went to Tsunade to train as both a medical ninja and to fight.</p><h3>Kazekage Rescue Arc</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2275116-sakura_haruno_shipp_den.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2275116\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"3.4387096774194\" data-width=\"155\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 155px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:343.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2275116-sakura_haruno_shipp_den.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2275116\"><img alt=\"Sakura's appearance in Part II.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 155px) 100vw, 155px\" data-width=\"155\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2275116-sakura_haruno_shipp_den.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2275116-sakura_haruno_shipp_den.png 155w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sakura's appearance in Part II.\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2275116-sakura_haruno_shipp_den.png\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120635/2275116-sakura_haruno_shipp_den.png 155w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 155px) 100vw, 155px\" data-width=\"155\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sakura's appearance in Part II.</figcaption></figure><p>After two years of training, Naruto returned to the village, and Tsunade challenged the pair to defeat Kakashi in training. Before they could get a new mission, they were sent on an emergency call to save Gaara, the new Kazekage, form the Akatsuki. Once at the Sand Village, Sakura saved Kankuro's life from the poison he had been infected by. Team 7 was joined by Chiyo in pursuit of Gaara. They were blocked by Itachi Uchiha, and Sakura learned afterward the fate a Jinchuriki faces once the Tailed Beast is removed.</p><p>Team 7 was joined by Team 9 as backup. Sakura broke down the bolder blocking the entrance to the Akatsuki cave, but they were too late. Gaara was dead, and Naruto chased after <a href=\"/deidara/4005-44957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44957\">Deidara</a>. Sakura stayed with Chiyo to fight <a href=\"/sasori/4005-44999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44999\">Sasori</a>, a master of ninja puppetry. When both were poisoned, they used the antidote Sakura had developed. Sakura then allowed Chiyo to manipulate her body as a puppet to use her experience with Sakura's strength. They destroyed most of Sasori's puppets, but Sakura was reinfected by the poison. After Sasori was defeated, Chiyo used a forbidden jutsu to heal Sakura using some of her own life force. Before Sasori died, he passed along information about Orochimaru and Sasuke.</p><p>Upon catching up with Naruto, who had rescued Gaara's body, Chiyo used her jutsu to try and revive him. Naruto offerd his own chakra to help as Chiyo was faltering, but Sakura didn't tell Naruto that this would also end Chiyo's life. With Gaara saved, they returned to the Sand Village before returning home with Team 9.</p><p> </p><h3>Sasuke and Sai Arc</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652285\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7495183044316\" data-width=\"519\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 519px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652285\"><img alt=\"Yamato-led Team Kakashi reveals themselves to Orochimaru and Kabuto.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 519w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Yamato-led Team Kakashi reveals themselves to Orochimaru and Kabuto.\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 519w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85563/1652285-519px_team_yamato.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yamato-led Team Kakashi reveals themselves to Orochimaru and Kabuto.</figcaption></figure><p>Kakashi had been badly wounded during the mission and was forced to be hospitalized after they returned to Konoha.

The new team sets out and discovers that the spy was waiting for the dead Sasori. However, it turns out to be a trap and the group battles Kabuto and Orochimaru. Naruto was left badly injured, but Sakura was able to heal his wounds. They then proceeded to Orochimaru’s hideout, and began infiltrating his lair.

When she finally caught up to Naruto, she confessed her love for him. Though, he doubted the sincerity of her words. She left appearing offended, then asked Kiba to track Sasuke down. Once located, she used a gas to knock out Kiba, Lee, and Sai. She planned to try and kill Sasuke herself. When she found him, she acted as if she wanted to join him, but he tested her by challenging her to kill Karin, one of his allies. Sasuke nearly tried to kill Sasuke as Kakashi arrived. She tried once more, but hesitated before stabbing him with a poisoned junai. This time, she was saved by Naruto. Sasuke was taken away by <a href=\"/tobi/4005-45000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45000\">Madara Uchiha</a>, who had declared war on the Five Great nations to claim all the Tailed Beasts; and Sakura returned to the village.</p><h3>Confining in the Jinchuriki Arc</h3><p>Tsunade had revived for her coma just as the other nations needed to unite and prepare for war. Naruto was tricked into hiding by telling him it was for a unique mission and to bond his chakra with the Nina-Tails. Sakura joined with the newly formed Shinobi Alliance to stop Madara and his army from capturing the Jinchuriki.</p><h3>Fourth Shinobi War Arc</h3><p>The army that Madara had created was filled with the greatest of all ninja who had ever lived. They had been revived using the forbidden jutsu. During the war, Sakura fought along Kakashi's squad in a rematch with Zabuza and Haku.</p><p>Later, the threat of the shape changing Zetsu clones proved to be the greatest threat. They were next to impossible to detect, and they could appear to be anyone. One that looked like Neji Hyuga tried to kill Sakura and the other medical ninja, but she tricked the copy and destroyed it with her own strength. Clones of Naruto soon appeared across the battlefield using the chakra of the Nine-Tails. With it he weeded out the Zetsu clones from the allied forces. With that settled, Sakura and the other ninja set out to unite with the real Naruto.</p><h3>Ten-Tails Revival Arc</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3087374\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.0722100656455\" data-width=\"1371\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1371px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3087374\"><img alt=\"Sakura released her full power with the Yin Seal\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" data-width=\"596\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg 1371w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg 895w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg 596w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sakura released her full power with the Yin Seal\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg 1371w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg 895w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3087374-untitled-4.jpg 596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\" data-width=\"596\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sakura released her full power with the Yin Seal</figcaption></figure><p>Upon their arrival, Sakura and the others learned that the real Madara was among the revived ninja, and the man who had been impersonating him was actually Obito Uchiha. Together they had managed to revive the Ten-Tailed Beast, and they would use it to rewrite reality to their design. Naruto protected the alliance members by coating them in a chakra cloak, and Sakura healed Naruto as he rested. During the wait, the four dead Hokage arrived, having been revived by Orochimaru; and Sasuke had soon followed.</p><p>While the Hokages held the Ten-Tails in place with a barrier, Sakura, Naruto, and Sasuke teamed up to rush inside and finally defeat the Ten-Tails. With all her preparations and three years of storing chakra, Sakura was finally ready to reveal her use of the Yin Seal to increase her battle strength.</p><h3>Infinite Tsukuyomi Arc</h3><p>After the Nine-Tails was ripped from Naruto by a now mortal Madara, Gaara rushed a dying Naruto to Sakura. He then transported them both to Naruto's father, <a href=\"/fourth-hokage/4005-45927/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45927\">Minato Namikaze</a>. On the way, Sakura had to resort to open heart massage to keep Naruto alive. Although, Minato was prevented from passing on his half of the Nine-Tail's chakra, Obito was able to transport Sakura and Naruto to his parallel dimension to protect them from Madara. He soon arrived and transferred some of all nine Biju into Naruto.</p><p>Afterward, Sakura was little more than a witness as Madara was betrayed by Black Zetsu in order to revive <a href=\"/kaguya-ohtsutsuki/4005-92516/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92516\">Kaguya Ohtsutsuki</a>. She placed the world under the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Sakura and Kakashi were protected from falling into its spell by Naruto and Sasuke. To stop Naruto and Sasuke from sealing her again, Kaguya threw Sasuke into an alternate dimension. Sakura then aided Obito to be his power source to retrieve him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5325042-4276719031-tumbl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5325042\" data-ratio=\"0.788\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.8%\" href=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5325042-4276719031-tumbl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5325042\"><img alt=\"Sakura taps her daughter on the forehead similar to how Itachi used to tap Sasuke, Sakura's husband.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5325042-4276719031-tumbl.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5325042-4276719031-tumbl.jpg 500w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5325042-4276719031-tumbl.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sakura taps her daughter on the forehead similar to how Itachi used to tap Sasuke, Sakura's husband.\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5325042-4276719031-tumbl.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5325042-4276719031-tumbl.jpg 500w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5325042-4276719031-tumbl.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sakura taps her daughter on the forehead similar to how Itachi used to tap Sasuke, Sakura's husband.</figcaption></figure><p>With Kaguya sealed away, Sasuke refused to help Naruto release the world's population, because he wanted to kill the Five Kage while vulnerable. To prevent Sakura from following them as they dueled over the issue, Sasuke used a powerful genutsu on Sakura to knock her out. By the time she awoke, the battle was nearly over. She and Kakashi arrived to find Naruto and Sasuke not moving and each was missing an arm. She used her medical jutsu to stop their bleeding. As he lay there, Sasuke finally apologized to Sakura for all he had done.</p><p>Some time later, Sasuke and Naruto went to travel the world. Sasuke refused to let Sakura travel with him, but made a promise to return. After several years, Sasuke did return.

However, she originally lacked much of a fighting spirit and would have to fall back from more intense fights. She eventually tired of being a burden on her team and following behind them. She trained with Tsunade to emulate her incredible strength and skills in medical-based jutsu.</p><h3>Sakura's Jutsu:</h3><ul><li><b>Transformation Jutsu (変化の術, <em>henge no jutsu</em>):</b> The Transformation Jutsu is a basic ninjutsu taught to in the Ninja Academy. It transforms the user into the appearance of another person and they can even speak as they do. This is a valuable skill for infiltration and deception. This is not a technique Sakura has frequently used.</li><li><strong>Substitution Jutsu (変わり身の術, <em>kawarimi no jutsu</em>):</strong> The Substitution Jutsu is basic fighting technique taught to ninja of the Hidden Leaf after graduation from the Academy. It's designed to have the user replace their body in an instant with an object from the surroundings just before an attack can hit. Sakura is immense proficiency with this jutsu and used it to great effect during the Chunin Exams.</li><li><strong>Genjutsu Release (幻術解, <em>genjutsu kai</em>):</strong> The Genjutsu Release is a technique that allows the user to break basic Genjutsu. This technique was taught to Sakura by Kakashi Hatake. Though, this will not work on several more powerful Genjutsus.</li><li><strong>Sakura Blizzard Jutsu (サクラ吹雪の術):</strong> With this is a technique, Sakura throws a barrage of kunai knives, that have exploding tags attached to them.</li><li><strong>Chakra Enchanced Strength:</strong> Sakura's enhanced strength is based from her chakra control training that she received from Tsunade. Chakra is gathered, condensed, and released at the point of impact.</li><li><b>Cherry Blossom Clash (桜花衝, <em>ōkashō</em>):</b> The Cherry Blossom Clash is a technique Sakura uses with her Chakra Enhanced Strength skills she learned from Tsunade. By focusing a large amount of chakra to her hand, she punches into the ground causing a massive shock wave. The destruction is dependent on the amount of chakra focused.</li><li><strong>Mystical Palm Technique (掌仙術, <em>shōsen jutsu</em>):</strong> The Healing Jutsu is a medical-ninjustu technique where the user forces chakra to their hand to speed the natural healing to the target and it can use used on one's self. Sakura was taught this technique by Tsunade.</li><li><strong>Chakra Scalpel (チャクラのメス, <em>chakura no mesu</em>):</strong> The Chakra Scalpel is a technique for a medical-ninja to focus chakra at their hands to create an extremely fine and long blade that can cut into the body of a target. It can be used for surgery or to cut muscle and nerves of an opponent.</li><li><b>Poison Extraction Jutsu (細患抽出の術, <em>saikan chūshutsu no jutsu</em>):</b>The Poison Extraction Jutsu allows the user to actually isolate and remove poisons from the blood. Using the Chakra Scalpel, an incision is made into the victim then chakra is used to force a large amount of medicinal fluid into the incision. This fluid serves to isolate poisons to then be drawn out of the body. In the process, the poison is removed and the damaged areas of the body are repaired. The extracted poison can now be isolated and analyzed to create an antidote. This is a highly advanced technique that was taught to Sakura by Tsunade.</li><li><strong>Yin Seal (陰封印 , <em>infūin</em>):</strong> This is an advanced Fūinjutsu sealing technique that Sakura was taught by Tsunade. This is performed by collecting and storing chakra over an extended period of time in the forehead. It will take on the form of a diamond. The release of this technique grants the user even more enhanced strength. Sakura stores chakra fro three years, and she doesn't need to use any of the power to maintain a youthful appearance, as Tsunade does. It all goes to her fighting techniques.</li></ul><h3>Jutsu Stats</h3><p>Ninja's are ranked by their proficiency with the various types of jutsu and other statistics.

The original manga coloring for Sakura gave her subtle make up and nail polish, but this never appeared in any of the anime episodes. A major continuity error occurs in <i>Naruto</i> Episode 103. At 19min 30sec in, Sakura uses incredibly strength to rip out the mast of the ship. This is a trick of Tsunade, but Sakura would not be trained by Tsunade until well after Sasuke left the village.</p><h4>Naruto Shippuden (2007)</h4><p>The <i>Naruto Shippuden </i> anime series is the second direct adaptation of Masashi Kishimoto's original manga.

He always wears a mask that covers the lower half of his face. He wears a forehead protector that he regularly uses to cover his scarred left eye. He wears the standard Jonin uniform with metal plated gloves from his days as a member of <a href=\"/anbu/4060-45225/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45225\"> ANBU</a>. He was a long thin scar running over his left eye down to his left cheek. His left eye was damaged in battle while he was young, where it was replaced with an active <a href=\"../../sharingan/18-44263/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> sharingan</a> of the <a href=\"/uchiha-clan/4060-50974/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50974\"> Uchiha clan</a>.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Kakashi has a dynamic personality. He was shown to be a very stern and serious ninja when he was much younger. He strictly followed orders and scorned anyone who disobeyed them. This caused some friction between him and his then team-mate, <a href=\"../../obito-uchiha/29-45971/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Obito Uchiha</a>. Obito was eventually mortally wounded in battle and this caused a change in Kakashi's attitude. He now has a more carefree and laid-back personality. His personality is further emphasized by his generally lazy expression, aloof manner, relaxed voice, and minimalist attitude. However, Kakashi can still be as emotionless as he was during his youth, often speaking bluntly about sensitive topics. In serious situations, he is shown to be extremely serious and calculating. During battle, Kakashi is known to first send out clones of himself in order to study and analyze his opponent. Despite his increasingly growing reputation and prowess as a ninja, Kakashi has shown no signs of arrogance, and is rather modest about his abilities.Kakashi is often late for appointments because he of his frequent visits to the memorial where Obito's name is engraved, where he loses track of time. He once said that he lost everyone that was close to him. This has caused some reluctance to allow himself get attached to people or allow people get close to him. Despite this, he cares deeply for the members of his team and his friends.</p><h2><b>Origin</b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/452824-vlcsnap_161886_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-452824\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/452824-vlcsnap_161886_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-452824\"><img alt=\"Team 10\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/452824-vlcsnap_161886_1.png\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/452824-vlcsnap_161886_1.png 400w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/452824-vlcsnap_161886_1.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Team 10</figcaption></figure><p>Hatake Kakashi is the son of one of Konoha’s greatest ninjas, Hatake Sakumo A.K.A The White Fang. Kakashi lost his mother at a young age and somehow blamed his father for this loss never truly forgiving him. Following in his fathers footsteps, Kakashi became known as a prodigy and one of the best in his generation. He scored top marks in his test and graduated within one year at the top of his class and is one of the youngest Chunin to dates, achieving this rank at the mere age of five. But soon things would change, his father returned from a mission in disgrace in the eyes of <a href=\"/konohagakure/4020-45367/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45367\"> Konoha</a> he had failed, during a battle he chosen to save the life’s of his team rather the complete the mission set out for him. <a href=\"/sakumo-hatake/4005-51478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51478\"> Sakumo</a> was never the same after that and it showed in his skill, soon enough Kakashi's father found depression as his only friend and took his own life. After his fathers death, Kakashi became cold and distant, but was soon placed within a team ( <a href=\"/team-minato/4060-56994/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56994\"> Team Minato</a>) to start the rest of his training. <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito Uchiha</a> and Rin would be his team along with <a href=\"/yondaime/4005-45927/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45927\"> Minato Namikaze</a> the soon to be The Fourth Hokage. As time went on it was noted that he shared a complicated relationship with his teammates which would later turn into a great bond much like that of <a href=\"/team-7/4060-44283/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44283\"> Team 7</a> which he would later train.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/350911-176747-obito-uchiha.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-350911\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"1.275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/350911-176747-obito-uchiha.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-350911\"><img alt=\"Obito/Kakashi\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/350911-176747-obito-uchiha.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/350911-176747-obito-uchiha.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" data-width=\"501\"></a><figcaption>Obito/Kakashi</figcaption></figure><p>Kakashi became a Jonin and was sent on a mission along with <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a> and Rin, They where to destroy a bridge that was being used by enemy forces to enter <a href=\"/konohagakure/4020-45367/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45367\"> Konoha</a> and therefore help in the third great shinobi war effort. But disaster struck when Rin was taken by two Iwagakure Jonin. <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a> wanted to rescue his teammate; But Kakashi said that the mission came first. Kakashi found himself in the same situation as his father had been in the past and did not want to make the mistakes that his father had. <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a> disagreed and left Kakashi not before telling him that what his father did in the past made him a hero not a disgrace. <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a> was confronted by Taiseki one of the Iwagakure ninja’s and was soon over powered, just then a flash of silver filled the air and using his father’s sword Kakashi entered the battle just in time to save Obito. As the battle raged on Taiseki managed to strike at Kakashi left eye, Kakashi had used his own body to block an attack meant for <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a>. terror took over as he watched the blood escape his friends eye and wanting to fight back past the fear his <a href=\"/sharingan/4055-44263/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44263\"> Sharingan</a> awakened , using it he killed Taiseki and helping Kakashi they headed for Rin.</p><p>It was here that Kakashi life would change forever, <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a> and Kakashi fought against the last ninja and save Rin, As the battle progressed <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a> and Kakashi worked as an unbeatable team and freed Rin, But the victory was short lived as the final Ninja caused a cave in, <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a> dived in time to save Kakashi from a falling rock which landed on him instead. As Obito lay dying he gave Kakashi a final gift for becoming a Jonin, his left eye ( <a href=\"/sharingan/4055-44263/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44263\"> Sharigan</a>). Rin, using her medical techniques, implanted the eye into Kakashi. He then used Chodori break free of the cave in and killed the Ninja who had caused Obito's death. Just then enemy reinforcements arrived and Kakashi fought to protect Rin, Telling her that he would not let her die as <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a> loved her. Just as the battle was about to be won by the enemy <a href=\"/yondaime/4005-45927/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45927\"> Minato Namikaze</a> and saved the two students and finished the mission with their help.</p><p>Kakashi soon became known within all the five great countries and picked up many different nick names along the way some even called him the ninja who has copied over a thousand jutsu. Kakashi soon joined the <a href=\"/anbu/4060-45225/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45225\"> Anbu</a> black ops and served as a captain and soon began training new members for <a href=\"/anbu/4060-45225/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45225\"> Anbu</a> such as, <a href=\"/yamato/4005-44245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44245\"> Tenzo</a> and Yugao Uzuki. Leaving the team he soon became a teacher within <a href=\"/konohagakure/4020-45367/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45367\"> Konoha</a> training new teams but still had strong ties to Anbu, This is where we meet Kakashi for the first time as a few year later he meets his new team consisting of three young ninja’s, <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto Uzmaki,</a> <a href=\"/sakura/4005-44242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44242\"> Sakura Haruno</a> and one of the last serving members of the Uchiha clan <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\"> Sasuke Uchiha</a>.

Kakashi was known for being one of the hardest teachers, failing all of the Genin that had come before Team <a href=\"/team-7/4060-44283/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44283\"> 7</a>. Taking the three young members into the woods he gave them a simple test of trying to take two bells from his belt. Those who did not have a bell by the end of this test (which was noon) would fail.</p><p>So the test started with <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto Uzmaki,</a> who instead of staying hidden with his other teammates, decided to fight Kakashi head on. The first thing Kakashi did was pull out his Icha Icha Paradise book, Naruto hesitated and Kakashi told him to continue, to give it all he's got. Naruto proceeded to attack Kakashi but ultimately failed when Kakashi dodged all of his attacks while reading Icha Icha Paradise. Kakashi after dodging one of Naruto's punches, he appears behind Naruto crouching, that is when he uses Thousand years of death (basically a powerful ass-poke with two fingers), Naruto ends up landing in a river, Kakashi turns to walk away when Naruto using his Famous Shadow Clone Jutsu, and while Kakashi is concentrated on them, a clone jumps on his back and Naruto attempts to punch Kakashi but Kakashi ends up using substitution jutsu where he switched his place with a clone and then Kakashi hid in the bushes. This causes confusion between Naruto and the clones since they think Kakashi used transformation jutsu and is one of them, they begin to fight amongst their selves till Naruto ends up undoing the justu and he is left standing there. Then Naruto noticing that Kakashi had \"dropped\" a bell when he escaped goes to pick it up and is caught in Kakashi's rope trap, and is left hanging upside-down. Kakashi appears again and picks up the bell. Sasuke jumps out of a tree and throws multiple shuriken at Kakashi. Only to be foiled by a substitution technique (but instead of a person like last time it was a log).</p><p>Sakura goes looking for Sasuke when she spots Kakashi from some bushes, thinking that she wasn't seen,she only turns around to find Kakashi behind her. (meanwhile Naruto ends up freeing himself only to be caught in the same trap below him) Kakashi uses a genjutsu on Sakura where she believed that she see's Sasuke dying..She ends up falling to her knee's screaming.Then she passes out (or in a different version of the manga it shows her laying there, tears in her eyes, and foaming at the mouth)</p><p>Kakashi ends up appearing behind <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\"> Sasuke</a> and they fight. Sasuke kicks Kakashi but his foot is caught,then he punches Kakashi only to find his arm caught too, Saskuke twists his body only to get a finger on one of the bells. At that point Kakashi tosses him away. Sasuke uses Fireball jutsu and when the flames clears, Kakashi is gone. Then Kakashi's hand grabs him from under ground and buries his whole body (except for his head) under rock.</p><p>Naruto finally gets free and decides to eat the food instead of trying to waste his energy on trying to get a bell from Kakashi, as he sits down to eat, Kakashi appears behind him, and ties him to a log as the bell signaling the end of the test.</p><p>Kakashi tells them that he wasn't going to send them to the academy, all of them assuming that they passed until Kakashi told them that they shouldn't even become shinobi. He tells them that they wouldn't ever get that answer to the test, and that is Teamwork. Kakashi says that if they were working together then they may have gotten the bells but they didn't. He tells them of how if they didn't work together it could even get them killed.</p><p>Kakashi tells them that they can try again after lunch but if they try to feed Naruto then they will automatically fail and can never become ninja . <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto</a> was now tied to a wooden post and the rest of the team began to eat. After Kakashi leaves then Sasuke and Sakura gives Naruto some food, since if they were to try after lunch then everyone would need full strength. Kakashi appears right in front of them, looking angry he tells them \"YOU ALL...\" then he smiles and says \"Passed\"</p><p>He tells them that those who break the ninja code are trash but those who don't care for their comrades are lower then trash. Then he tells them their first real assignment as Team 7 begins tomorrow. Kakashi, Sasuke, and Sakura all leave, but they forget that Naruto is still tied up to the log.</p><h2>Key Story Arcs</h2><h3>Land Of Waves</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/823285-558px_naruto_teamkakashi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-823285\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 419px\" data-ratio=\"1.0739856801909\" data-width=\"419\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/823285-558px_naruto_teamkakashi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-823285\"><img alt=\"Kakashi leads Team 7 \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px\" data-width=\"419\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/823285-558px_naruto_teamkakashi.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/823285-558px_naruto_teamkakashi.jpg 419w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kakashi leads Team 7 \" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/823285-558px_naruto_teamkakashi.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/823285-558px_naruto_teamkakashi.jpg 419w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px\" data-width=\"419\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kakashi leads Team 7 </figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/team-7/4060-44283/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44283\"> Team 7</a> was originally assigned small missions, one of which was capturing an escaped cat.

Tazuna went on to explain about his village. Gato a local crime lord had taken over the village and Tazuna needed protection to build the bridge in order for new revenue and aid to enter the land of waves At first Kakashi is reluctant to help but after the rest of Team 7 push him they deiced that they will be his protectors till the bridge is finished.</p><p>On their trip they are once again attacked, but this time it is by a much stronger ninja <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a> Momochi a hired killer. Using strategy they over power <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a>, but he manages to capture Kakashi in a bubble of water known as the Water Prison Technique.

But <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto</a> refuses to go saying he will never run from a fight, not after what happened before. <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto</a> looks at <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\"> Sasuke</a> and the two works with each other, <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto</a> helps <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\"> Sasuke</a> throw a ninja shuriken towards <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a> who dodges it but then realizes there is a second one hidden in the path of the first one. Dodging the two he starts to gloat just when one of the shuriken he had dodged turns into <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto</a> who catches the second shuriken and sends it back towards <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a>. This time <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a> has no choice but to dive out the way. As <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a> stands he laughs saying they missed, Just then <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto</a> smiles and said they where not aiming for him. Turning round <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a> realizes what the plan was all along, to break his concentration and set Kakashi free. Now Kakashi shows us the <a href=\"/sharingan/4055-44263/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44263\"> Sharingan</a>, his greatest weapon, for the first time. The <a href=\"/sharingan/4055-44263/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44263\"> Sharingan</a> is a technique that only the Itachi clan can use, but a past accident gave Kakashi the eye as he took it from a dying friend. Using the eye Kakashi is able to copy all of <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza’s</a> attacks and send them back towards the ninja faster then <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a> could make them.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127858-60171-sharingan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127858\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127858-60171-sharingan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-127858\"><img alt=\" Kakashi's Sharingan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127858-60171-sharingan.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127858-60171-sharingan.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Kakashi's Sharingan\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127858-60171-sharingan.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/127858-60171-sharingan.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Kakashi's Sharingan</figcaption></figure><p>Just as Kakashi is about to make the finishing blow, a flash of silver struck <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a> body and he fell down apparently dead.

When arriving at the villiage they are teamed with <a href=\"/chiyo/4005-45015/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45015\"> Chiyo</a> a elder of the Sand Village and are sent off on the trail of <a href=\"/akatsuki/4060-45002/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45002\"> Akatsuki</a>. As they make their way they are confronted by a ninja who looks like <a href=\"/itachi/4005-44260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44260\"> Itachi</a>. Kakashi found it strange that he could go toe to toe with <a href=\"/itachi/4005-44260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44260\"> Itachi</a> and said that his power level was different. Getting the upper hand Kakashi holds <a href=\"/itachi/4005-44260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44260\"> Itachi</a> giving <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto</a> the chance to do the finishing move.

Kakashi and <a href=\"/guy/4005-45030/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45030\"> Guy</a> come up with a plan.

This is where team Kakashi come across <a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\"> Gaara</a> and <a href=\"/deidara/4005-44957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44957\"> Deidara</a></p><p>Sasori tries to flee using one of his clay creatures to make a large bird that carries him and <a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\"> Gaara</a> away. This is where Kakashi new training is shown, using his new technique Mangekyo <a href=\"/sharingan/4055-44263/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44263\"> Sharingan</a>, Kakashi creates a portal and tries to remove <a href=\"/deidara/4005-44957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44957\"> Deidara's</a> head.

But this allows <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto</a> the chance to regain <a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\"> Gaara’s</a> body and so Deidara returns and a battle starts, as it looks lost <a href=\"/deidara/4005-44957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44957\"> Deidara</a> makes a clone that will explode taking team Kakashi and <a href=\"/team-guy/4060-45139/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45139\"> Team Guy</a> along with it. Once again using the Mangekyo Sharingan, Kakashi destroys the body but passes out from using to much Chakra.

The <a href=\"/sharingan/4055-44263/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44263\"> Sharingan</a> allows him to copy any Jutsu he sees (provided it is not a Bloodline limit Jutsu), but also allows him to see and predict the movements of his enemies before they make them. The original owner of the eye, <a href=\"/obito-uchiha/4005-45971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45971\"> Obito</a> was a member of the Uchiha clan and therefore this eye belongs to the clan and should only be able to be used by them. It was surgically taken from its original owner and replaced with Kakashi's non-functioning eye, his body has not adjusted itself to the eye. It is this reason that Kakashi can never deactivate the eye and keeps thus is forced to keep it covered with his headband, so as not to consume Chakra unecessarily. Kakashi even prefers not to use it in certain battles as the eye consumes a lot of his Chakra. It is unknown how Kakashi has made his Sharigan stronger as he is not an Uchiha, however he managed to evolve the eye to three tomoe. Later in the series Kakashi pushes the Sharigan even futher during training and creates his own version of the Mangekyo Shairgan. Also in the series it comes to light that Kakashi has been training with the Sharingan as he can now use it for a full day while fighting Naruto and Sakura.</p><h4><b>Mangekyo Sharingan</b></h4><p>As his students are training with others Kakashi takes this time to improve his own skills. During this time he learns a Mangekyo Jutsu “Kamui”. It allows him to create small black holes near his enemy, which has the power to pull them into another world or rip of body parts. He uses this while fighting Deidara. Deidara is impressed saying he rivals Itachi control but Kakashi admits that he is nowhere near finished and only achives in taking off Deidara arm as he needs more practice telling Naruto he was aiming for Deidara’s head. After this Kakashi is able to use it once again in the same battle against a speeding attack, Blocking it with the Jutsu . But the technique almost kills him after he uses too much Chakra and is taking to hospital where he remained in a coma for a week; this was the result of only using the new Jutsu three times in one day. Since that day Kakashi has not used the Jutsu again to this day.</p><h3>Chidori</h3><ul><li><p>A technique that was created by Kakashi. However, he now uses an even more advanced techique called Lightning Blade. This technique channels a lot of lightning chakra to the user's hand and sounds like a lot of birds chirping. The user then runs and thrusts his hand into the target. The technique can pierce through most substances, however it has drawbacks as the user must run in a straight line and he must have the sharingan or his foes will be able to counter the attack with ease.</p></li></ul><p><b>Rasengan</b></p><p>Kakashi was either taught or copied the rasengan by/from his teacher, <a href=\"/yondaime/4005-45927/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45927\"> Minato</a>. The rasengan does not have a fixed amount for it and the user can use it as much times as he wants as long as he has the chakra for it. The rasengan damages internally in a horrific spinning motion, literally tearing the opponent apart inside. This attack cannot be used in places where it drains chakra like Jirobou earth release barrier.</p><h3>Summoning jutsu</h3><p>Kakashi has signed the summoning contract with the dogs and he can summon eight dogs to help him track his opponents or hold them in place like what he did to <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> Zabuza</a> before charging the restricted foe with chidori or lightning blade.</p><h3>Evil sealing jutsu</h3><p>This jutsu takes up a lot of chakra and can be used to seal off <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\"> orochimaru's</a> curse mark. However, it depends on the wearer of the curse mark's will to see if he wants to use them as well.</p><h3>Water clone technique</h3><ul><li>Kakashi copied this jutsu from <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\"> zabuza</a>. The clone is often used for distracting or for attacking his enemies. If the clone is injured, it will turn back into normal water.</li><li>Kakashi emerges from the earth and pulls the opponents down until only his head is not in the ground. After that, kakashi can torture or kill him.</li></ul><h3>Silent homicide technique</h3><ul><li>Kakashi uses this technique along with the hidden mist technique. The user of this technique slits the throat of his opponents with a blade. This attack be defended against.</li></ul><h3>Hidden mist technique</h3><ul><li>This jutsu envelops the surrounding area in a dense mist, reducing visibility within the affected area. The density can be controlled by the user, allowing them to create a mist so thick that the user and the people inside cannot see through and has to rely on sound alone to know each other's place. This technique can be used to prevent people from using genjutsu as it requires eye contact. This attack is used by kakashi alongside the silent homicide technique.</li><li>This technique can be used to defend the user against attacks.</li><li><b>Thousand years of pain</b>- A joke technique he used to humiliate Naruto in combat, the user thrusts his finger at the opponents rear,causing immense pain and embarrassing him.</li></ul><h2>Experience</h2><p>Kakashi is known as a very capable and experienced ninja, as he was once an <a href=\"/anbu/4060-45225/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45225\"> Anbu</a> captain and a jonin. He is able to remain calm in battles and formulate a battle plan to defeat his opponents. He has been lauded to have the 'intelligence of <a href=\"/shikamaru/4005-44247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44247\"> Shikamaru</a>, the scent capacity of <a href=\"/kiba/4005-44279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44279\"> Kiba</a>, and the fighting skill or <a href=\"/lee/4005-44527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44527\"> Rock Lee</a>.</p><p>Additionally, he is an Elite Jounin. This is a prestige rank that is bestowed upon only the best of jounin, with the rank of jounin alone already signifying an elite and powerful ninja. Only four known Ninja from Konoha have reached this rank: Kakashi, <a href=\"/might-guy/4005-48904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48904\"> Maiito Gai</a>, <a href=\"/asuma/4005-44514/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44514\"> Asuma Sarutobi</a> and <a href=\"/kurenai/4005-44516/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44516\"> Kurenai</a>.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>TV</h3><h4>Naruto Clash: In The Land of Snow</h4><p>In this movie Team 7 was ordered to go on an A-Rank mission that invovled them escorting a famous actress named Yukie Fujikaze to the Land of Snow. As they arrived in the Land of Snow, Team 7 and the actress were attacked by three ninja from the Snow Village that Kakashi had fought years ago during his time when he was still an ANBU. Shortly afterwards it was revealed that Yukie Fujikaze was in fact actually Koyuki Kazahana the true heir as daimyo to the Land of Snow. It was then revealed that Kakashi had saved her years ago from her deceitful uncle Doto. Using his Sharingan eye Kakashi coied some of the ninjas ice-based jutsu allowing them to escape quickly.</p><p>After realizing what Doto was actually searching for, Kakashi replaced Koyuki's crystal necklace with a fake one in an effort to stop Doto. When Koyuki Kazahana was kidnapped, Kakashi along with his team except for Naruto engaged in a rescue mission. Moments after this Kakashi returned Koyuki's necklace to her however Doto captured his niece taking the necklace along with him as well.</p><p>Later Kakashi was intercepted by Nadare Roga and knowing that his opponent had a high protection from both ninjutsu and genjutsu because of his armor, Kakashi relied solely on his taijutsu and defeated Nadare Roga by using his <i>\"Front Lotus\"</i> technique. Shortly after Doto was defeated and Koyuki took her rightful role as daimyo of the Land of Snow, to his joy Kakashi learned that Koyuki would be playing a lead role in a new <i>\"Icha-Icha\"</i> movie.</p>",

Zabuza has said that Haku is more dangerous than him as Haku had a lot of talent. Haku possessed a great deal of knowledge of the human body, such that he could kill or disable a ninja just by hitting a spot in his body. Haku was also very analytical, he is able to gather a lot of data just by observing his enemies's movement.</p><p>Also, Haku possessed the kekkai genkai of ice release. Haku could utilise wind and water chakra to create ice. One of jis jutsu is demonical ice crystal which allows him to cross over to other mirrors very fast and attack with needles or senbon.

    "description": "<h2>Appearance</h2><p>Yamato has short brown hair and black eyes. When he first appeared, Yamato wore the standard attire of a member of the ANBU, with a mask of a cat with markings. When he meets up with Naruto, Sakura, and Sai for the first time, however, he has changed into a variation of the standard attire of a Leaf shinobi. The differences between his attire and that of the standard attire is that his does not have the swirlycrest on the shoulders of the sleeves, with the neck of his form fitting and goes up to his chin. In addition to that, he has a mask style forehead protecter that frames his face, similar to that of the second hoakge.</p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><figure style=\"width: 284px\" data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-658146\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/658146-yamato_s_team.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.70422535211268\" data-width=\"284\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/658146-yamato_s_team.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-658146\"><img alt=\"Yamato's time as Leader\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/658146-yamato_s_team.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/658146-yamato_s_team.jpg 284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-width=\"284\"></a><figcaption>Yamato's time as Leader</figcaption></figure><p>Yamato was one of Orochimaru's test subjects, having implanted the D.N.A. of <a href=\"/the-first-hokage/4005-49812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49812\"> The First Hokage</a> into him as a small child to try and replicate the 1st Hokage's unique bloodline limit that allowed him to use wood <a href=\"/jutsu/4015-50943/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50943\"> Jutsus</a>. However, Yamato was only one of 60 test subjects and believing all of them had died due to the experiments, Orochimaru fled the Hidden Leaf village without checking. Yamato would survive and thanks to the D.N.A. of the 1st Hokage, he would greatly excel as a ninja and even become the Anbu captain after Kakashi stepped down. He is currently the leader of Team 7 under the orders of the 5th Hokage. Due to the inclusion of Sai as Sasuke's replacement, there is some animosity that Yamato has to keep under check, going as far as saying that he will rule with terror... which is ultimately a scary face that only frightens Naruto.</p><h2>Sasuke and Sai Arc</h2><p>Yamato accompanies Naruto, Sakura, and Sai to the Heaven and Earth bridge to meet Sasori's spy and uses Transformation to make himself look and sound like Sasori in his Hiruko puppet. The spy turns out to be Kabuto and everything goes relatively smoothly until Orochimaru appears, revealing that Kabuto and Orochimaru had planned on killing Sasori. When Naruto started sprouting his tails and made the bridge collapse, Yamato used his mokuton abilities to catch Sakura when she fell. After dealing with Kabuto, Yamato used his other ability to subdue an out of control 4-tailed Naruto, which is why Tsunade made him the new team captain.The Team 7 have looked for Sai after his betrayal to the team. However, after seeing him, they were able to find out more about Sai's personality and joined the team. Kabuto then appeared and untied Sai from Yamato's wood ties and battled the team. Believing that Sai really have betrayed the team, yamato was surprised to see Sai helping them. Yamato then led the team inside orochimaru's hide out and seeked for Sasuke. After the encounter with Orochimaru, the team then encountered Sasuke who have already changed and fought them. Yamato have been brutally hurt but was able to recover after making a counter strike against Sasuke's technique.</p><p> </p><p>The Team then went back to Konoha and reported to Tsunade where he reveals Sai's relation with Danzo. Yamato would go onto aiding Naruto in his wind affinity training, keeping the Kyuubi under control since the seal on Naruto is weakening, allowing the Kyuubi more influence over Naruto as his anger spikes. He'd then accompany Naruto to aid Kakashi against Kakuzu after his technique was finished. They made their entrance blocking Kakuzu's wind fire attack with their own combined wind and water techniques to create a typhoon. After Naruto misses his first attempt with his new raseangan Yamato protects him while Kakashi gets him away from kakuzu. After defeating the akasuki members they travel back to Konoha. After another meeting with the kage they decide to take Naruto to an island where Killer Bee stays and trains with their tailed beast. They also decide that Yamato go with him too. when they arrive at the island they are attacked by a squid, which Yamato states he only has 6 tentacles and Naruto thinks is the Octopus that he was supposed to meet. When they get settled on the island Yamato and the guide take him to a waterfall where he must face his inner self. Yamato the waits for Naruto to complete his task. When Naruto is sitting around after his fight with his inner self Yamato and their guide get attacked by the squid again. Yamato tries to restrain the beast while they try to get the guide back, but Killer Bee comes and knocks the squid away before anything else happens. After that he just tags along with Naruto and Killer Bee to the waterfall of truth and once Naruto wins Yamato asks if he can come and follows them behind the waterfall. They then go to a lions mouth and Killer Bee tells Naruto has to put his head in the mouth and see if it will accept him, if it doesn't it will eat his head off. Naruto plays a trick on Yamato and pretends his head got eaten but tells Yamato it was a joke. Yamato becomes really mad and calls them stupid idiots. Then they go in the room where Yamato sits with them while Naruto and Killer Bee fight the Nine-Tailed fox. When the foxs hatred starts to take over Naruto Yamato says that he will try and hold it back while Naruto meets his mother beneath all the hatred he is going through. When Naruto finally manages to control the nine tail's chakra he notices Kisame in Killer Bee's sword, Yamato states that the chakra gives him the ability to sense hatred. Later on when Kisame is captured he is put in a wood element prison that Yamato made but breaks out of it to Yamto's surprise. When the island is attacked by Kabuto Yamato tries to make it seem like their are earthquakes so that Naruto wouldn't notice. he eventually gets caught in a fight with Kabuto and Kabutos snake form swallows and captures him. Later he is seen on the ground if front of Madara who is talking about how to use his powers to make more clones. Madara also states that his left eye is ready for a fight showing that he has the rinnegan.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Powers/Abilities</h2><p> </p><p>In the Narutoverse people's chakra possess a single elemental affinity which allows the individual to learn that specific element easier than any other.. However, the unique bloodline limit of the 1st Hokage grants Yamato with two elemental affinities, water and earth. By utilizing both of these elemental affinities at the same time, Yamato can create trees and various wooden structures. Though his mokuton abilities are not just limited to the surface that he stands on, he can also make trees grow from his own body. Another nifty ability he has is \"Wood Clone.\" Much like a Shadow Clone but is capable of taking damage. Also wood style is very versatile and can be used for offense and defense and since it is part of users body they can communicate with anything that is part of him ex. tracking. A running gag is that since he is only know person who has wood element people want him to do everything and he constantly has to overuse his abilities and becomes exhausted.</p><p> </p><h2>Full List Of Jutsu </h2><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Earth Release </h3><p>Earth Flow Divide </p><p>Earth Flow Rampart</p><p>Hidden Among Rocks</p><p>Rising Stone Spears</p><p>Underground Projection Fish</p><p> </p><h3>Water Release </h3><p>Hand of Waves</p><p>Tearing Torrent</p><p>Typhoon Water Vortex</p><p>Waterfall Basin</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Wood Release </h3><p>Binding Nest</p><p>Dense Woodland Wall</p><p>Four Pillars House</p><p>Four Pillars Prison</p><p>Great Forest</p><p>Serial Pillar Houses</p><p>Wood Clone</p><p>Wood Locking Wall</p><p>Wood Transformation</p><p> </p><h3>Other</h3><p>Hokage-style Sixty-year-old-Technique-kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-bringing Hands</p><p> </p><h3>Stats</h3><p> Ninjutsu/4.5</p><p>Taijutsu/4</p><p>Genjutsu/3.5</p><p>Intelligence/4.5</p><p>Strength/3.5 can lift 5 tons when using all force.

    "deck": "Though he has no real name, Sai is a member of Danzo's \"Root,\" a secret group in Konoha that swore to do whatever it takes to protect the village. He is currently in the war against Madara. Married to Ino Yamanaka and had a son with her named Inojin.",
    "description": "<h2>Characteristics</h2><p><b>Birth Date:</b> November 25<b>Age Line:</b> 16-17</p><p><b>Blood Type:</b> A</p><p><b>Highest Rank:</b> ANBU</p><p><b>Height:</b> 172.1 cm. <b>Weight:</b> 53.3 kg. <b>Known Relatives:</b> Shin (adopted brother, deceased)</p><h2>Sai</h2><p><a href=\"/tsunade/4005-44512/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44512\">Tsunade</a> was pressured into making Sai <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\">Sasuke</a>'s replacement in <a href=\"/team-7/4060-44283/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44283\">Team 7</a>, but <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\">Naruto</a> and <a href=\"/sakura/4005-44242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44242\">Sakura</a> were also met by a new group leader, <a href=\"/yamato/4005-44245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44245\">Yamato</a>. They set out to meet <a href=\"/sasori/4005-44999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44999\">Sasori</a>'s spy and get information from him, possibly even capture him for further questioning. On their trip the group came to know each other better, but Naruto had already previously met Sai, who attacked him in Konoha. Although Sai exclaimed that he merely wanted to test his teammate a little bit. Sai had the habit of insulting others (unintentionally) and saying what's on his mind, not considering others' feelings... or rather, not understanding them, which caused alot of animosity between him, Naruto, and Sakura. But Sakura was intrigued by Sai and sought to learn a little more about him; she found out that he's a painter and he told her that he was trained as a small child not to have any emotions and it's hard for him to understand emotions or even the bond that Sakura and Naruto have with Sasuke, admitting that he didn't even cry when his brother died. He also informed her that he has been trying to simulate emotions after learning what he reads in books, but nobody believes them. She came across a picture book that Sai was working on and asked if she could see it, but Sai told her that he didn't want anyone seeing it.</p><h2>Sasuke &amp; Sai Arc</h2><p>Back on their mission, the spy turned out to be <a href=\"/kabuto/4005-44523/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44523\">Kabuto</a> who was secretly a double agent, actually working for <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a>. He and Orochimaru planned on killing Sasori right then and there and that's when Team 7's plan fell apart, but Kabuto and Orochimaru too realized that they were tricked. The <a href=\"/kyuubi/4005-46398/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46398\">Kyuubi</a>'s chakra began to flood out of Naruto as he sprouted four tails and attacked Orochimaru, scaring Sakura. Sakura and Yamato had a brief scuffle with Kabuto, but Sai was mysteriously absent in all of this. Kabuto informed Team 7 that he and Orochimaru don't want to fight them, saying that Akatsuki has been a thorn in their side and they're hoping that Team 7 can take out more of their members for them. With no more threat, Yamato took the opportunity to suppress the Kyuubi's chakra within Naruto. While that took place, Sai confronted Orochimaru and offered an alliance, giving Orochimaru an envelope that he was ordered by <a href=\"/danzo/4005-62677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62677\">Danzo</a> to give to Orochimaru. The three took off, but Yamato's Wood Clone followed. Team 7 soon gave chase after Sakura found Sai's picture book laying on the ground. The team started to go through it, trying to figure out it's meaning and find out why he'd betray them. On their way, they came across Sai, having been hung by Orochimaru and Kabuto. This however was a trick meant to halt their pursuit, they followed still.</p><p>At Orochimaru's hidden base, it's revealed that the envelope contained detailed information on many powerful figures within Konoha and Danzo was hoping that they could help each other overthrow Tsunade since Danzo hates her and wants to be the Hokage. Orochimaru is intrigued and has Kabuto put Sai in a locked room. Team 7 are going through Sai's book and they notice that it stars two characters, both of their \"stories\" start on opposite sides of the book and seem to meet in the center, however the center pages are missing. They notice that one of the characters is Sai who is shown fighting different people on each page, and every next page shows him with something his previous opponent owned. This trend was the same with the other white-haired character, but they had no idea who it was. Team 7 would find Orochimaru's base and find Sai. There, they talked with him and he revealed what he told Orochimaru and what the true plan is... Orochimaru is a threat to Konoha and Sai was supposed to relate any new information about him back to Danzo so that Root can kill him. They talked a little more about Sai's picture book and he reveals that it's his brother in that book... or rather, they called each other \"brother.\" Root is made up of orphans that Danzo trained to be perfect soldiers. Sai revealed that he can send messages to Danzo because of his ability to turn his writings into small animals and send these messages to Danzo safely. Sakura asks if he's the one that killed his \"brother,\" but Sai informs her that she's incorrect and that he died of illness. He said that he came from the two where <a href=\"/zabuza/4005-44261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44261\">Zabuza</a> came from She tries to convince him that Sai did have a bond once and that he should understand what her and Naruto are going through. Sai feels like he may understand a little and agrees to help them find Sasuke, and they split up. They have tied Sai and interrogated him about further information about his mission. Kabuto then appeared believing that Sai was tortured and needs to be rescued. The joined forces of the Team 7 was good but quite not enough. Though, as kabuto unties Sai, he attacked Kabuto and declared his betrayal to Orochimaru saying that he wants to know how Naruto feels for his friend Sasuke. Sai then helped the Team 7 look for Sasuke after some interrogations to Kabuto. Due to the hideout's large area, the Team 7 have to be divided. Naruto was with Sai while Sakura is with Yamato. Sai and Naruto then decided to have a rest as they tell stories about each other. Sai compares Narutio to his brother because of many comparable things between the two of them. As Sai reminisces his memories with his brother, Sai finally was able to remember what he is about to draw before his brother passed away. He get his picture book and drew his brother holding his hand and they were both smiling. Despite the happiness that he feels, Orochimaru then appeared and fought them asking Sai who is really his companion. Naruto decided to continue fighting the aforementioned villain and Sai was assigned by Naruto to look for Sasuke. Sai drew a bunch of rats to seek for Sasuke as they seek every corner of their hideout. At last, he have found where Sasuke is sleeping. Meanwhile, Yamato and Sakura have helped Naruto against Orochimaru but he only teleported away to look for Sai. Yamato then looked inside Sai's backpack which he left in the area. He have found out about his Bingo Book. That book is a book where assassins list their targets. The team was surprised as they turn the page and found out that Uchiha Sasuke was one of their targets.</p><p>They open every door in Orochimaru's lair trying to find Sasuke, but Sai is the first to find him. Sasuke asks why Sai would disturb his sleep, and Sai informs Sasuke that he's supposed to kill him. Naruto and Sakura hear a large ruckus and go to see if Sai's ok. They find out that Sai wasn't only supposed to kill Orochimaru, he was supposed to kill Sasuke too... since he's a threat to Konoha aswell. Naruto attacks Sai, but Sai informs them that he <i>was</i> supposed to kill Sasuke, but he decided not to, wanting to learn more about \"bonds.\" They find Sasuke watching them from up high and after a brief talk, Sasuke attacks Naruto but Sai stops him from killing Naruto. After a brief scuffle, Kabuto and Orochimaru appear and stop Sasuke, telling him that they have a temporary truce with Team 7 and leave.</p><p>Team 7 later return to Konoha. They have reported to Tsunade about the events that happened during their mission. Yamato then have revealed Sai's relationship with Danzo which angers her. Sai then went to Danzo and asked him if he can stillstay with the Team 7. Danzo agreed. He then became very serious in studying about making more friends. He have found out that the best way to have friends is to drop the honorifics and make nicknames instead. After conversing with Sakura and Naruto, based on the book, he have called Sakura ugly and led to her being mad. Naruto have tried to stopped Sakura's anger but as only hurt. She punched both of them leading Sai and Naruto's cheeks to be hurt. The team then proceeded to Kakashi's room wherein they had a conversation about their mission. It was the first time for Sai to meet Kakashi. Sai meets Chouji and Ino. Sai having former encounters with the team havefound it uncomfortable to talk with them. However, because of the book that he often reads, he decided to try to became nice to them.Sai thinks to himself that a book said that a good way to make friends was to give people nicknames, so he was about to call Chouji a fatass... but Naruto stopped him. Seeing Chouji get defensive and realizing what Sakura did earlier when he called her \"butt ugly,\" he realized that people don't like to hear the truth, so he calls Ino \"beautiful,\" which makes her blush... but angers Sakura.</p><h2>Five Kage Summit Arc</h2><p>After the invasion, Danzō is made <a href=\"http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Hokage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hokage</a>. He summons Sai before him and instructs him to keep an eye on Naruto. Sai asks why, so Danzō explains that Naruto, having defeated Pain , is the village's hero and thus more popular than Danzō himself. However, he is still the village's jinchuriki and must be kept in check. Sai is satisfied and goes to meet with Naruto and Sakura. The two immediately confront him about Danzō, asking that he tell them everything he knows. Sai says that he cannot, as the seal Danzō placed on his tongue prevents him from revealing anything about Root. Sakura says it is cruel, but Sai explains that it is for the best since Root has done a number of questionable things to protect the village.</p><p>Sakura refutes his claim, pointing out that Danzō has ordered Sasuke be killed as a traitor. Sai is surprised, Danzō not having told him that during their meeting. They are immediately confronted by ninja who ask for what they know about Sasuke. Naruto, seeing that this upsets Sakura, volunteers to tell them all that he knows. Sai secretly watches the meeting and how Naruto cannot bring himself to sell out Sasuke. Naruto allows Karui to take out her anger on him. Karui happily accepts and begins beating him up, but Sai steps in once she starts to over do it. When Karui leaves, Sai brings Naruto to Kakashi and Yamato and then tends to his wounds.Sai later approaches Sakura, telling her about what Naruto went through with Karui for her benefit. He surmises that Naruto loves Sakura, and that trying to make her happy, such as bringing Sasuke back to the village, causes him constant pain.</p><p>Following the decision to eliminate Sasuke themselves to prevent a war, Sakura asks that Sai help her track down Naruto so that she can speak with him. They find him in thenLand of Iron and Sakura tells Naruto that she loves him, so now he doesn't need to bother fulfilling his promise of retrieving Sasuke. When Naruto claims she is lying she leaves. Because she doesn't mention the decision to kill Sasuke, he leaves a clone behind to tell them what Sakura did not. The clone also adds that Sakura is likely planning to kill Sasuke personally, and mentions that Sakura is in love with Sasuke and wants to stop him from sinking any lower.</p><p>The ink clone helps Kakashi locate Sakura. The real Sai, meanwhile, stops Sakura from knocking out him and her other escorts, having suspected that she would try to get rid of them so she could fight Sasuke alone. Sakura convinces Kiba and Lee that Sai is a traitor and they start to fight him, but this only makes it easier for her to knock out all three. As the ink clone disperses it warns Kakashi of Sakura's actions. Sai and the others are later woken following the meeting with Sasuke, and as they return to the village they are met by three Root members. They inquire about what has happened. Sai affirms that the seal disappearing is proof that Danzō has died. He then encourages them to speak with Kakashi who he addressed as the \"new Hokage\" about Roots' future.</p><h2>Shinobi World War Arc</h2><p>Sai is part of the Surprise Attack squad of the Shinobi Joint Forces and they ambush Deidara and Sasori. Sasori uses Sai's desceased \"brother\" to fight Sai.</p><p>Sai clashes weapons with Shin until his teammates join in. When Deidara detonates the Exploding Clay inside Shin, the blast knocks Sai to the ground. His picture book falls out of his bag during the explosion. As Deidara is hovering in the sky, he complains that Kankurō's puppet smothered the blast. When he refers to Shin as \"the bomb\", this angers Sai. Sasori states that the Root members and he are much alike since they both have suppressed their emotions. Deidara also taunts Sai, proclaiming that he will turn Shin into a bomb over and over again. Enraged, Sai draws an ink bird and flies quickly behind Sasori and Deidara. He then draws two ink warriors which knocks both Akatsuki members downwards from the sky. At ground level, Kankurō summons two of his puppets, imprisoning Sasori and Deidara inside of them. Sai drops down to engage Shin in combat, stating that their battle would most likely have happened had Shin not died. However, Shin states that their fight was no longer necessary. Seeing Sai's completed picture had unbound his soul, freeing him of the regrets that he had in life. Tears flow from Sai's eyes as Shin's body disperses into ash and dust.</p><p>The Surprise Attack Division commences their ambush, Sai launching several exploding tag-carrying ink birds at Haku and Zabuza's group. And then tells Zaji to send up the flare to aleret the other battalions. Once they meet up with Kakshi's squad they just stand back until Kakashi gets control of Zabuza. Once Kakashi gets someone to seal Zabuza and Haku he ask Sai to use on of his sealing techniques since he was Danzo's prized pupil. Lee and others provide Sai cover so he can complete his Tiger Vision Staring Bullet, then each time one of their opponents are open he seals them away.</p><h2>Powers/Techniques</h2><p>Sai is a great artist and spends his most of his time drawing. Sai's most popular <a href=\"/jutsu/4015-50943/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50943\">Justu</a> is a kind which allows his paintings to become three dimensional; it is called \"Super Beast Imitation Drawing.\" Sai commonly uses animals or monsters from Japanese folklore of various sizes for his fights, and makes birds for himself or others to fly on. He can also use his drawings to help him scout the area or to send messages to others, as well as carry explosive seals to attack the opponent. He has a jutsu called \"Tiger Vision Staring Bullet\" in which one of his drawings will emerge and drag an opponent with it back onto the scroll, sealing him/her into the paper. He can also creates clones of himself made out of ink and make a blinding ink haze to hide his escape. He is also skilled using a small sword called a tanto that he carries with him.</p>",

During the first exam, Shikamaru is able to avoid putting in any effort thanks to <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/ino-yamanaka/4005-44248/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44248\">Ino Yamanaka</a> using her special ninjutsu to possess <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/sakura-haruno/4005-44242/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44242\">Sakura Haruno</a>, steal her answers and then possess both Chouji and Shikamaru and write down the answers for them. For the second test they are sent into the Forest of Death where they have to combat the other teams to steal scrolls they possess and reach the tower in the center. Sakura's battle with the Sound ninja is spotted by the team and they move in to spectate.</p><p>At first Ino was reluctant to come to her friend's aid but after prodding from Shikamaru dives in followed by her teammates. Following their training the three members made their battle formation and attacked, Shikamaru immobilizing <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/dosu-kinuta/4005-46247/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46247\">Dosu Kinuta</a> with his Shadow Possession jutsu.

As soon as the Sound Ninja were defeated, the three teams helped each other with their injuries and went their separate ways. After they passed the first test, Team 10 went onto the next round which turned out to be single one-on-one rounds against the other ninja. Shikamaru would have to fight <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kin-tsuchi/4005-53154/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53154\">Kin Tsuchi</a> of the Sound Village, who he had earlier faced during the first exam.</p><p>Kin is able to draw blood from Shikamaru using a technique involving bells, strings and senbon but Shikamaru was using her own trick against her. He had allowed her to use her attack so he could extend his shadow under the strings and capture her in his Shadow Posession Jutsu, there after he removed a shuriken from his pouch forcing Kin to imitate him. Kin pointed out that if he threw the shuriken he would be attacked in kind. Shikamaru threw the shuriken and then ducked. As he did so Kin followed not realizing that her evasive actions and backing up to make full use of her illusory technique had caused her to come to stand right in front of the nearest wall. The contact with the wall knocked Kin out winning the match for Shikamaru.</p><p> </p><h3>Temari Vs Shikamaru</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180621-119978-temari.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-180621\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2725\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180621-119978-temari.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-180621\"><img alt=\"Temari\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180621-119978-temari.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180621-119978-temari.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Temari\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180621-119978-temari.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180621-119978-temari.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Temari</figcaption></figure><p>The final exam was another battle between the winners of the last round, Shikamaru was matched up with <a href=\"/temari/4005-45076/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45076\">Temari</a> of the Sand Villiage. Throughout the battle Shikamaru attempted several ploys to trick Temari into stepping into a shadow, but none met with success. Temari soon learned that his seeing cowardly behavior was a plot to wait her out until the sun had dropped low enough to give his shadows a wider range. Shikamaru then forces Temari to retreat make to some lengths using his make-shift balloon composed of his jacket to give himself an extra shadow. Then is a shock twist Shikamaru captured Temari, it turned out the whole battle was about manipulating her into position so she would be standing in front of a dug out tunnel that Naruto had made in an earlier battle and caught her with his shadows from behind, when she had been focusing on all of his frontal attacks and distractions.</p><p>It looked as if Shikamaru had won the battle when he turned and forfeited the match, saying that he had used to much chakra to fight anyone after this match if he continued and that he did not like to hurt or hit women. Shikamaru's strategy and willingness to retreat when the situation becomes unwinnable impressed judges and sensei and due to his performance during this battle would be later be made into a Chunin with blessing of the Third <a href=\"/hokage/4060-50942/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50942\">Hokage.</a></p><p> </p><h3>Battle For The Village</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/327701-181023-asuma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-327701\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.54\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/327701-181023-asuma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-327701\"><img alt=\"Asuma Saves Shikamaru\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/327701-181023-asuma.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/327701-181023-asuma.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Asuma Saves Shikamaru\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/327701-181023-asuma.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/327701-181023-asuma.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Asuma Saves Shikamaru</figcaption></figure><p>During the final battle between Sasuke and <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/gaara/4005-44258/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\">Gaara</a>, the Sound and Sand Villages decided to make their moves on the Village Hidden in the Leaf. They used a genjutsu to put everyone in the observing stadium to sleep, then had members of both villages invade the stadium and village. Shikamaru was able to dispel the technique, though he pretended to be asleep to avoid taking part in the battle. Sakura noticed Shikamaru pretending to sleep and told him to help in pursuing Sasuke who had chased after a fleeing Gaara. As they chased after Sasuke they where informed by the ninja dog Pakkun whom was leading them to find Sasuke that nine Sound ninja where on their trail. Shikamaru told them to go ahead and follow Sasuke and he would deal with the Sound ninja.</p><p>It was not long before they found him, but Shikamaru had set up traps and this allowed him to capture eight of the ninja that came to attack him. He was then able to a find out the one remaining enemie's position by attempting to kill the ones he captured. After the defense of his allies gave away his position Shikamaru found he had spent to much energy in the fight with Temari to capture him. As the jutsu wore off leaving all nine enemies free to attack him, he resigned himself to death but was saved by the rapid intervention of his teacher Asuma who went on to defeat all nine in the blink of an eye.</p><p> </p><h3>Save Sasuke</h3><p>Due to his show of skill and awareness during the exams, Shikamaru was made a Chunin by the Fifth Hokage. As he knew Team Seven and who they would be trying to save, Shikamaru was ordered on his first assignment of leading and building a team to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and stop him from joining <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a>. Shikamaru set about building his team, but was only allowed to use Genin due to the attack on Konoha and lack of available upper ninja. Shikamaru first enlisted Naruto and Choji and then later Neji and Kiba. As they set out, Shikamaura had already planned an attack, placing Kiba at the front knowing his abilities would pick up any traps laid for them as well as the added partner of Akamaru to aid in an attack. He himself followed Kiba to allow for better communication between the rest of the group as well as close proximity to Kiba. After him he put Naruto third, knowing he could reinforce either the front or the back with his multitude of Shadow Clones. Next in line was Choji, who could follow up with the finishing blow after he, Kiba, and Naruto launched an attack, and had Neji follow up the rear, knowing his Byakugan would cover anything the team missed and prevent attacks from behind.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099547-2144321767-825-n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5099547\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099547-2144321767-825-n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5099547\"><img alt=\"Shikamaru and his team.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099547-2144321767-825-n.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099547-2144321767-825-n.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shikamaru and his team.\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099547-2144321767-825-n.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099547-2144321767-825-n.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shikamaru and his team.</figcaption></figure><p>As they moved and caught up to the Sound Ninja, they where trapped by <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/jirobo/4005-50185/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50185\">Jirobo</a> one of Orochimaru’s four men who had taken Sasuke. Sitting down and watching Naruto and Neji striking at the rock formation they where now trapped in Shikamaru formulated a plan of escape, as Naruto struck at one point the others would strike at the weak point that would be on the other side of the trap. When they escaped Choji decied to stay behind and face Jirobo on his own knowing the others would be escaping. Shikamaru told Choji that he better catch up and left with his now only three team mates as they went Shikamaru marked their path so that Choji could follow. As they met each new threat the team broke down one by one to face Orochimaru’s men one on one allowing the team to catch up to Sasuke.</p><p>Shikamaru told Naruto to go ahead and as he was one of the only people that could get to Sasuke and stop him. This left Shikamaru to face <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/tayuya/4005-50142/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50142\">Tayuya</a>, a female ninja who used a flute to make genjutsu and confuse her enemies. As the battle progressed and Shikamaru began to get the up hand, Tayuya summoned three demons to her side. The demons where controlled by her flute and Shikamaru allowed them to attack him to start with, as this was a ploy to allow Shikamaru to pick up on what notes created what movements. Soon after he took control of the three with his Shadows control and turned them back on their master who was forced to set them send them from where they came.</p><p>Her only weapon was her flute and she began casting genjutsu and soon Shikamaru found himself having to come up with a new plan of attack. Throwing a kunai he purposely missed and then fell under the genjutsu. Thinking she had won, Tayuya removed the Kunai that was now stuck in the tree behind her and began to move to slit his throat. When she got close enough Shikamaru launched his surprise attack. He had been pretending to be caught under genjutsu so that she would move into range for his attack. He broke his own finger with his shadow possession jutsu and used the pain to break out.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/622182-tayuya_60090.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-622182\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75238095238095\" data-width=\"210\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/622182-tayuya_60090.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-622182\"><img alt=\"Tayuya\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/622182-tayuya_60090.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/622182-tayuya_60090.jpg 210w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tayuya\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/622182-tayuya_60090.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/622182-tayuya_60090.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tayuya</figcaption></figure><p>She had no choice but to use her cursed seal to break free of the attack Shikamaru could feel his chakra fading and knew the battle would be over.

Questing everything he had done Shikamaru went to leave Konoha but was met by his father who called him a coward. He said that if he was not there to lead them then some other ninja would have to and he would always question if one of them died could he have stopped it if he was leading. As news arrived telling them that everyone was going to be okay, Shikamaru broke down in tears and swore he would do better next time.

Naruto attempts to form a team to find and free Sasuke but Shikamaru is unable to aid him due to his responsibilities in training the new students. Later a new Ninja appears and Naruto along with Shikamaru and Choji join in trying to question the stranger. He quickly makes his escape, however, and it is later discovered that the Ninja was Sai, the newest member of Team 7.</p><p> </p><h3>Attack Of The Undead</h3><p>During the Fire Temple arc Shikamaru was kept back at Konoha using his strategic mind in the defense around the village. The town was attacked by Furido and a team of rouge Ninja who each held great powers. During the attack all the dead during the Sand and Sound Invasion and including the dead of the towns Furido had attacked all came to life and attacked the village. Shikamaru was ordered to lead the counter attack and using everyone’s combined strengths was able to push the enemy line back as the other groups dealt with the four ninja’s.

The team consisted of four shinobi, Asuma, Shikamaru, Izumo Kamizuki, a well trained Jounin and finally Kotetsu Hagane another of Konoha's top Ninja's. During one of their mission they had managed to track down two of the Akatsuki members named <a href=\"/hidan/4005-44997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44997\">Hidan</a> and <a href=\"/kakuzu/4005-44998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44998\">Kakuzu</a>, who were dropping off a bounty they had taken from the Fire Temple (one of the dead priest’s).</p><p>As Hidan waited outside for his partner to do his business with the bounty collectors Niju Shotai came across him. Shikamaru used his Shadow Possession to capture and restrain Hidan and the rest of the team set about finishing him off. It turns out that Hidan is actually an immortal and their attacks had done nothing to harm him. Right after that, Kakuzu appeared and launched an attack that broke off Shikamaru's jutsu, allowing Hidan to engage the rest of the team. As the battle raged on Asuma found himself facing Hidan and soon had the upper hand until Hidan cut Asuma along the arm and used his blood to start a ritual. As the ritual took place, all the damage done to Hidan was now being done to Asuma as well, and since Hidan was immortal the damage had no effect on him. It looked as if Asuma was done for when Hidan went to stab himself in the stomach which would kill Asuma, but Shikamaru trapped him again and made him walk out of his ritual circle, breaking the hold he had on Asuma.</p><p> </p><p>Asuma powered his blades with wind chakra and charged the immortal, praying that cutting of his head would finally kill him. Asuma succeeded with the blow and as Hidan's head landed on the floor he began to laugh. Even this had not killed him. Kakuzu once again jumped in and broke up the battle, reattaching Hidan's head with some of his own sewing thread and joined the fight facing Izumo and Kotetsu. This allowed Hidan to step back into the ritual circle, and although Shikamaru rushed to help his master, his chakra was too depleted, and while he was running Hidan made the final blow, impaling himself and killing Asuma. Just then Choji and Ino arrived into battle with two other Jounin, which forced Kakuzu and Hidan to make their escape, leaving the death of Asuma in their wake. As Asuma died, he told Shikamaru that one day he may be Hokage and that some times a knight must be sacrificed to protect the king. Shikamaru took Asuma's last cigarette and began to smoke it, flicking the lighter cap back and forth and said it was the smoke that had brought tears to his eyes.</p><p>The whole village could be seen mourning Asuma's death and all but one attended his funeral. Shikarmaru was busy coming up with a plan for revenge, and when he was finished with his plans and had collected what he needed, he met up with Choji and Ino to track down Hidan. They all had a strong connection to Asuma and wished to help their old team mate. But before they could leave Tsunade appeared and said that they where not ready and this type of mission would need a four man group. Then from nowhere <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kakashi-hatake/4005-44243/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi Hatake</a> appeared and offered his help, convincing the Hokage that they were going anyway and he could at least keep his eye on them. Shikamaru changed his plan so that he could use Kakashi, impressing the Jounin with his analytic mind and prowess.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-153781\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2875\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-153781\"><img alt=\"Death Of Asuma\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death Of Asuma\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death Of Asuma</figcaption></figure><p>It did not take long for them to find Hidan and Kakuzu again. His plan started using the two knives that Asuma had used, pinning the shadows of the Akatsuki members, then he went on to use his Shadow Possession once again to give him complete control over the two of them. Before he could finish the, though, Kakuzu escaped. Shikamaru still had complete control of Hidan and now attacked Kakuzu with his own team mate, but it was all a ploy to corner the faster moving Kakuzu and allow Kakashi to sneak up behind him and attack him with Chidori. They thought they had won but in fact Kakashi had only destroyed one of Kakuzu hearts, and he still had four more. Kakashi and Team 10 where forced to come up with a new plan of attack. Now that they where the one's on the defensive, they had to split them up. After a short physical exchange, Shikamaru once again caught Hidan and lead him away from Kakuzu as Kakashi, Ino, and Choji faced off against the other Akatsuki member.</p><p>Leading him into the nearby forest where Shikamaru had set up exploding scrolls prevented Hidan from escaping. As they reached their destination, Shikamaru's chakra ran out and Hidan went on the attack, quickly cutting Shikamaru and starting his ritual. Now seeing how smart Shikamaru was, Hidan took no chances and stabbed himself in the heart. Shikamaru fell to the ground clutching his chest, but this once again was a trick. When Kakashi had struck Kakuzu with his Chidori, he had taken a small amount of blood as ordered and given it to Shikamaru as part of his plan. Knowing that his Shadow Possession was going to fail, Shikamaru had kept the blood and as Hidan went to strike, threw the blood onto his weapon and then cut himself. Hidan had actually stabbed Kakuzu in the heart and not Shikamaru.</p><p>Hidan still had no idea that this had happened and as he went to leave Shikamaru sprang into action and tried to chop of his head with one cut, but it was not deep enough. He was left with no choice but to use his Shadow Stitching jutsu again, but this time it was much weaker and Hidan forced himself out to attack Shikamaru who pulled out his trump card. His end game technique that used all the exploding scrolls he had placed around to tie up Hidan above the ground. Now with Hidan captured, Shikamaru went to the floor below Hidan and activated a seal he had placed upon the ground before the battle and the ground beneath Hidan disappeared to reveal a pit. Shikamaru had planned this all along, this was to be the outcome no matter what had happened each move and step had lead to this moment. Shikamaru then told Hidan about the forest they where in and that it belonged to the Nara clan and only his clan where allowed to enter and leave. It was protected not just by his clan but the actual forest itself, no one would retrieve his remains and this would be his final resting place. Placing one of Asuma's cigarettes in his mouth he lit it with Asuma's lighter and then threw it, making all the scrolls explode all at once and Hidan's body parts fell into the hole. Hidan's head lay at the top swearing revenge and Shikamaru caused a cave in and walked away.</p><p>Once back with the team he found Naruto was with them and he had delivered that last blow that killed Kakuzu, now with this behind them they returned to the village. Shikamaru finally visited Asuma's grave leaving the lighter with his old master as a final goodbye.</p><p> </p><h3>Pein Attacks</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099687-a1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5099687\" data-ratio=\"0.92241379310345\" data-width=\"348\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 348px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099687-a1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5099687\"><img alt=\"Shikamaru consulting Naruto about Jiraiya's message.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px\" data-width=\"348\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099687-a1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099687-a1.jpg 348w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shikamaru consulting Naruto about Jiraiya's message.\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099687-a1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5099687-a1.jpg 348w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px\" data-width=\"348\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shikamaru consulting Naruto about Jiraiya's message.</figcaption></figure><p>After the death of <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/jiraiya/4005-44511/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44511\">Jiraiya</a>, Naruto's master, Shikamaru was ordered to help decipher his last message. Unable to break it, he went to help Naruto get over the loss of his master, explaining that one day the two of them will have students and they would do everything in their power to protect them. With the help of Naruto and another scientist, Shikamaru was able to break the code, which read: \"The Real One Is Not There\". Now it was up to Shikamaru to figure out what Jiraiya had meant by this cryptic message, but before he could find the answer Konoha was attacked by <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/pain/4005-45001/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45001\">Pein</a>. Choji himself and Kakashi where among the first to enter the battle, fighting the main Pein body.</p><p>They where soon defeated and Kakashi was killed. Shikamaru and his father came across Ino and her father and tried to work out what Pein's powers where. They figured out Pein's real body must be near by so Inoichi, Shikaku and Ino went on to find him, but when Pein attacked the village as a whole, Shikamaru received a broken leg and could not help even when Naruto was fighting Pein one on one. He wanted to help but was told he would just get in the way. In the end, Naruto beat Pein and convinced him to bring everyone that he killed in his attack back to life. Afterwards, Shikamaru was among the people who welcomed the hero home.</p><p> </p><h3>Seeking Permission</h3><p>After the battle Sasuke is declared a enemy of Konoha by Danzo who was appointed the new Hokage after Tsunade's fell to her injuries. After meeting with the rest of the Konoha teams, Shikamaru hunts for Team 7, unaware that Naruto has already left to talk to the leader of Kumogakure. So he finds Sakura and ask if she will give him permission to hunt down Sasuke and that he wishes to speak to Naruto about it. Sakura tells him that she will go instead to tell Naruto and she heads of to the land of iron.</p><p> </p><h3>Fourth Shinobi World War</h3><p>As the Akatsuki grew impatient in waiting to collect the Eight and Nine Tailed Beasts, the remaining members teamed up with Kabuto and his White Zetsu army. With Tobi, masquerading as Madara Uchiha, declaring war on the ninja world, the five nations did something unprecedented in the history: made an alliance. The ninja of the world gathered their forces and Shikamaru was put in Gaara's Division as well as made the proxy leader of the division, due to Gaara also being the main Commander to all the other battle divisions. Shikamaru is first deployed towards The Land of Lightning. Before long, his division is called over to aid the First Division in their fight against <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kinkaku/4005-76362/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76362\">Kinkaku</a> and <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/ginkaku/4005-76363/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76363\">Ginkaku</a>. They arrive and quickly enact their Ino-Shika-Cho attacks, leading with Choji's signature Human Boulder jutsu, and once he was thrown upwards by Kinkaku, Shikamaru trapped him in his Shadow Possession jutsu. Before long, though, Kinkaku's immense strength allowed him to break out and attack Shikamaru with his tail, but Ino intervened. Taking control of the enemy ninja with her Mind Transfer jutsu, Ino speaks the phrase Kinkaku had said the most in his life which allowed him to be sealed by the Sage;s Amber Purifying Pot. </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5100912-6864399369-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5100912\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5100912-6864399369-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5100912\"><img alt=\"Shikamaru, Choji, and Temari preparing for war.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-width=\"800\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5100912-6864399369-latest\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5100912-6864399369-latest 800w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5100912-6864399369-latest 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shikamaru, Choji, and Temari preparing for war.\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5100912-6864399369-latest\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5100912-6864399369-latest 800w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5100912-6864399369-latest 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-width=\"800\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shikamaru, Choji, and Temari preparing for war.</figcaption></figure><p>They didn't get any respite, however, as right after they were called to engage the reincarnated Asuma Sarutobi, Shikamaru's former sensei. Shikamaru and Ino resolved themselves to fight their former master, but Choji had his doubts which stopped him from physically hurting Asuma and preventing the team from sealing him. Even though Shikamaru attempted to talk Choji into fighting spirit and Asuma called him \"fat\", something that would usually enrage Choji in the past, he still couldn't bring himself to harm Asuma and Ino needed to step in with her Mind Transfer to save him. As Asuma attacked Choji again, his father Chouza jumped in to save him and took the brunt of his fire attack. growing ever more angry with Choji, Shikamaru convinced him that they are adults now and need to man up and do the protecting. His words reached finally reached Choji in time for him to enter his butterfly mode, enhance his strength, and defeat Asuma with a powerful punch. As Asuma was being sealed, he told them their formation was perfect.</p><p>After Asuma was sealed, Shikamaru helped his shinobi allies finish off the rest of the White Zetsu clones and seal the last of the Edo Tensei ninja. As they were finishing up, Tobi appeared behind them and summoned his Gedo Statue and attempted to steal the Sage's Ninja Tools that were used to seal Kinkaku and Ginkaku. The statue repelled attacks from giant Choji and Chouza and overpowered an attempt to trap him between two large slabs of earth summoned by <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kitsuchi/4005-90809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90809\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitsuchi</a>, greatly injuring many of the shinobi in the area. As Tobi was moving in to grab the gourd, Shikamaru managed to trap him in his jutsu, earning praise from the Akatsuki leader. Shikamaru didn't have much time to relish the fact, though, as the Gedo Statue moved to stomp him, but he was saved by the timely arrival and intervention of Choji. As Tobi left with what he came for, night fell and both sides of the conflict dug in to wait it out until the morning. </p><p>The next day it is revealed that White Zetsu have infiltrated the Shinobi Army and are disguising themselves as members of the army. When they would get another ninja alone with them, they would kill him, and they did this both to healthy and even injured shinobi. When Shikamaru hears of the news, he orders Ino and Choji to draw circles around themselves and not to leave the circles until they could make sure none of them were White Zetsu in disguise. Should they leave the circle, Shikamaru would regard them as hostile and attack them, so none of them left their circles until Naruto arrived and with his new Nine Tails power, rooted out all the undercover White Zetsu and prevented them from killing anymore Allied Shinobi. </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101082-a2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5101082\" data-ratio=\"0.93058568329718\" data-width=\"461\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 461px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101082-a2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5101082\"><img alt=\"Shikamaru receiving Nine Tails' chakra from Naruto.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" data-width=\"461\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101082-a2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101082-a2.jpg 461w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shikamaru receiving Nine Tails' chakra from Naruto.\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101082-a2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101082-a2.jpg 461w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" data-width=\"461\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shikamaru receiving Nine Tails' chakra from Naruto.</figcaption></figure><p>As the war raged on, Shikamaru became informed that Naruto and <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/killer-bee/4005-56686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56686\" rel=\"nofollow\">Killer Bee</a> have started fighting the \"masked Madara\" and that he is putting his life on the line for the rest of the Shinobi world. Shikamaru, his other classmates, and the rest of the Allied Forces all travel over to help out the two jinchuuriki. As the whole of the Allied forces arrive to aid Naruto and Bee, Shikamaru's father <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/shikaku-nara/4005-89075/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89075\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shikaku</a> lays out a plan to trap and immobilize the newly summoned Ten Tails. The shinobi follow the plan to the letter, trapping the Ten Tails in the ground, but only for a short time. The Ten Tails was actually only gathering its power and evolving, and it soon broke out of the tap and began attacking the ninja. Aware now of the damage the Shinobi HQ could so, Tobi and the now revived <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/madara-uchiha/4005-80827/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80827\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madara Uchiha</a> began attacking far away cities and the shinobi HQ. Knowing his time was coming to and end, Shikamaru's father relayed the next plan to him before the blast hit, letting him know that he is now the chief strategist for the Allied forces. </p><p>With his father's last plan, Shikamaru orders Naruto to distribute some of his chakra to each member of the Allied Forces. Once empowered by Naruto's version-1 chakra-like cloaks, the remaining Allied Forces enact Shikaku's last plan: a large-scale Formation Ino–Shika–Chō. Shikamaru and other members of the Nara clan use their Shadow Possession Jutsu to hold the Ten-Tails' in place while the rest of the Alliance attacks. The attack succeeds in removing the Ten-Tails from Obito and Madara's control but as a consequence, the Ten-Tails' attacks become more devastating, lashing out without any control or remorse. When the Ten-Tails prepares to destroy the Allies with one of its Tailed Beast Balls, Shikamaru has Ino use the Mid Transfer jutsu to connect him with Kitsuchi so that the Rock ninja could teach him a simple protective wall jutsu. With this knowledge, he then has Ino connect him to the rest of the shinobi so that he can teach them this same jutsu in an attempt to deflect the Tailed Beast Ball. Even though the shinobi use the jutsu and erect multiple rock walls, it's still not enough to completely stop the Tailed Beast Ball as it heads towards them. However, due to Shikamaru's quick thinking, the thousands of rock walls were able to slow the Tailed Beast Ball down slow enough so that the reincarnated <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/fourth-hokage/4005-45927/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45927\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fourth Hokage</a> could teleport the attack harmlessly away into the nearby ocean. </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101103-a1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5101103\" data-ratio=\"0.97126436781609\" data-width=\"870\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 870px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101103-a1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5101103\"><img alt=\"Shikamaru with the rest of the Rookie 9. \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px\" data-width=\"870\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101103-a1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101103-a1.jpg 870w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5101103-a1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shikamaru with the rest of the Rookie 9. \" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101103-a1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101103-a1.jpg 870w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5101103-a1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px\" data-width=\"870\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shikamaru with the rest of the Rookie 9. </figcaption></figure><p>Along with the other three reincarnated Hokage, Sasuke Uchiha appears on the battlefield as well, telling Naruto and his other classmates that he intends to fight with Konoha and defend it. Wary of the Uchiha for what he's done in the past, Shikamaru reluctantly agrees to his help along with the rest of the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/konoha-11/4060-60516/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60516\" rel=\"nofollow\">Konoha 11</a>. As this is going on, the four Hokage erect a barrier around the Ten Tails to prevent it from escaping and the Ten Tails creates thousand of smaller versions of itself to fight off the ninja. Together again for the first time in years, Shikamaru and his classmates team up to engage the Ten Tails minions after being allowed in he barrier by the Kage. Opting to go with their Human Yo-Yo, Formation E, Shikamaru took control of an enlarged Choji and swung him around with his Shadow, hitting and taking out targets that Ino sensed with her technique. As the Ten Tails minions grew too big for the ninja to advance any further, Team 7 summoned their animal companions to help out, Sakura's healing, while Naruto and Sasuke's took the fight to the Ten Tails' main body. As they neared, Shikamaru, along with the rest of the Rookie Nine, encouraged the two of them to stay strong as their attacks hit the main body. </p><p>At the same time, Kakashi had been fighting Tobi, now revealed as Obito Uchiha, in the Kamui realm, and both had injured each other through the chest. Obito took the worst injury, however, and as he teleported back, Madara took control of him and attempted to bring himself back to life through one of the Six Paths of Pein jutsus. Before that could happen, however, Minato strikes down Obito, preventing him from bringing Madara back and managing to keep him an Edo Tensei. As Obito's life was fading, however, he took control of the Ten Tails and became its jinchuuriki.  </p><p> </p><h3>Ten Tails Jinchuuriki</h3><p> </p><p> </p><h2>IQ</h2><p>Shikamaru has an IQ of over 200, beyond that of a genius. Despite being a Jounin, Asuma has never beat him in shogi. During his fight with a Sand ninja, he realized that it was impossible to defeat her although he had thought of over 100 of strategies. Shikamaru is a good planner and is able to devise brilliant strategies to defeat his enemies, becoming the Seventh Hokage's aid later in his life. </p><p> </p><h2>Personality</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175960-13999-shikamaru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175960\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175960-13999-shikamaru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175960\"><img alt=\"Everything Is Such Effort\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175960-13999-shikamaru.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175960-13999-shikamaru.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Everything Is Such Effort\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175960-13999-shikamaru.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175960-13999-shikamaru.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Everything Is Such Effort</figcaption></figure><p>Shikamaru is calm and collected and lazy at times. He is very easy-going and can really get on Naruto's nerves. In the chunun exam in the last part he won against Temari, but he ended up quitting. Naruto was so furious because he did not understand. Shikamaru says how was so tired and he does not have a lot of chakra left. But, there are times when Shikamaru isn't lazy. When they went to rescue Sasuke. Shikamaru says:</p><p>\"I know I seem lazy at times, but not today because now I'm responsible for all your lives. I really did not like Sasuke but, he is part of our village and I have to protect him thats our leaf way\"</p><p>Everyone is surprised of how he was not being lazy. Shikamaru can be annoying and lazy but his a great leader. For that he became a Chunin, before Shipudden. Shikamaru is nice sometimes too, he's great to he's beat friend Choji they been best friends for years. Shikamaru is a great ninja.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers/Techniques</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175963-163517-shikamaru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175963\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.7425\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:174.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175963-163517-shikamaru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175963\"><img alt=\"Shadow's\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175963-163517-shikamaru.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175963-163517-shikamaru.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shadow's\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175963-163517-shikamaru.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7940/175963-163517-shikamaru.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shadow's</figcaption></figure><ul><li>\"Shadow Possession\" where he extends his shadow to connect to his opponent's shadow.

She was first introduced during the <em>Chūnin Exam Arc</em>, which began in Volume 4.</p><p>She first appeared in <i>Naruto</i> Volume 4, CH. 34 <i>\"Intruders?\"</i>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Ino's name comes from the word 猪 (inoshishi), which mean \"wild boar\". Sakura uses this meaning when insulting Ino to call her a \"pig\". In the first character poll taken on the popularity of the series characters, Ino placed 30th, but in following polls she would peak at 14th.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Chūnin Exam Arc</h3><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/asuma-sarutobi/4005-44514/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44514\">Asuma Sarutobi</a>, Ino, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shikamaru-nara/4005-44247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44247\">Shikamaru Nara</a>, and Choji Akimichi's jonin master, had nominated them to take part in the Chūnin Exam. The first part was a written test, and Ino used her mind-body switch technique on Sakura to copy her answers then pass them along to Shikamaru and Choji. After passing the first part, they were sent to the Forest of Death for part two of the exam. Inside the forest, Ino and her team witnessed Sakura being attacked by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sound-village-ninja/4060-59907/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59907\">Sound Ninja</a> while she fought alone to defend <a href=\"http://www.animevice.com/naruto-uzumaki/18-22570/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Naruto</a> and Sasuke. Rather than abandoning them, Ino elected to help save Sakura.</p><p>At the center of the forest, they held some preliminaries to thin the field for the final part. Ino was paired against Sakura. They two had a fierce hand-to-hand match, but Ino was able to trap Sakura in her possession jutsu. However, Sakura was able to break free before Ino could force Sakura into forfeiting. The battle between the two ended in a double KO, and they were both failed form the exam. Though, this fight helped them start to patch things between them and renew their broken friendship.</p><h3>Invasion of Konoha Arc</h3><p>Near the end of the Chūnin Exam, the Sound Village and Sand Villages had united to attack Konohagakure. Ino was among the crowd at the stadium that was put to sleep by the enemy.</p><h3>Sasuke Retrieval Arc</h3><p>Ino only learned about how Sasuke had betrayed the village to side with Orochimaru after the fact. Shikamaru and Choji had been on the team to try and retrieve him, and Choji had returned seriously injured. Ino went to the hospital to visit Choji.</p><h3>Sasuke and Sai Arc</h3><p>Over two years had passed since Naruto had left the village to train, and Ino ran into him soon after she found Shikamaru and Choji. He had been looking for people to join his team, but they had a mission of the own. Ino later got to meet Naruto and Saukra's new team member, <a href=\"/sai/4005-44246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44246\">Sai</a>, after they returned from their mission.</p><h3>Hunting the Immortals Arc</h3><p>Ino and Choji both went to back up Shikamaru and Asuma in their fight with <a href=\"/hidan/4005-44997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44997\">Hidan</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kakuzu/4005-44998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44998\">Kakuzu</a>, two members of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/akatsuki/4060-45002/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45002\">Akatsuki</a>; but they were too late to help Asuma. His final words to Ino is that she shouldn't let herself lose to Sakura in ninjutsu or romance. Ino and Choji later joined Shikamaru to hunt the two down. Tsunade originally refused to let them leave until <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kakashi-hatake/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi Hatake </a>agreed to join them.</p><p>Ino used her jutsu to possess some birds to find the pair, but Shikamaru felt her techniques were too risky in the fight. Shikamaru eventually led Hidan deeper into the woods as part of their plan, and Naruto, Sakura and Sai joined Ino's segment to finally kill Hidan.</p><h3>Invasion of Pain Arc</h3><p>During <a href=\"/pain/4005-45001/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45001\">Pain's</a> attack on the village, Ino rushed to warn her father, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/inoichi-yamanaka/4005-90789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90789\">Inoichi</a>. She could only witness as one of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/six-paths-of-pain/4060-59902/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59902\">Six Paths of Pain </a>attacked and pulled the life force out of <a href=\"/shizune/4005-50174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50174\">Shizune's</a> body. Ino stayed with her father and Shizune's body as Naruto returned to save the village. After Naruto was able to turn Nagato, he used his resurrection technique to revive all of the lives he stole. Shizune was returned, and Ino was among those celebrating Naruto's victory.</p><h3>Five Kage Summit Arc</h3><p>In the wake of Pain's invasion, the Konohagakure received word from <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kumogakure/4020-58358/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58358\">Kumogakure</a> that Sasuke had attacked them and abducted <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/killer-bee/4005-56686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56686\">Killer Bee</a>, the Fourth Raikage's brother, while working for the Akatsuki. The protections on Sasuke had been lifted by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/danzo-shimura/4005-62677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62677\">Danzo Shimura</a>, and Sasuke was now an internationally wanted criminal with a kill on sight order. Shikamaru called together a meeting of their graduation class to discuss the need to kill Sasuke themselves to prevent any more retaliation. Ino took this news harder than most.</p><h3>Fourth Shinobi World War Arc</h3><p>During the Fourth Shinobi World War against the Akatsuki, Ino was in the Fifth Division of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/allied-shinobi-forces/4060-59898/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59898\">Allied Shinobi Forces</a>. Ino, Shikamaru, and Choji helped <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/darui/4005-76215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76215\">Darui</a> in his fight with <a href=\"/kinkaku/4005-76362/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76362\">Kinkaku</a> and <a href=\"/ginkaku/4005-76363/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76363\">Ginkaku</a>. Ino saves Shikamaru from Kinkaku as he nearly broke free of Shikamaru's hold, then she forced Kinkaku respond to Darui to capture him inside his own  Kohaku no Jōhei technique. She escaped from his body before she was captured and sealed.</p><p>Rather than fight the revived Kakuzu, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shikaku-nara/4005-89075/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89075\">Shikaku Nara</a>, Shikamaru's father, instructed them to focus their fight on Asuma, who had also been revived by the Akatsuki. Ino had to force the reluctant Choji to fight with their former teacher until Shikamaru was able to talk some sense into him. She then used her Mind Clone Switch Technique on two <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/zetsu/4005-45020/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45020\">White Zetsu </a>in the fight to seal Asuma.</p><p>After the appearance of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/demonic-statue-of-the-outer-path/4055-57531/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57531\">Demonic Statue of the Outer Path</a>, the White Zetsu changed their plan of attack by morphing into memebrs of the alliance. Ino then followed Shikamaru's plan to draw a circle around themselves and not step out while they waited for reinforcements. When a shadow clone of Naruto appeared, he gained control of the power of the <a href=\"/kurama/4005-46398/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46398\">Nine-Tails </a>and was able to spot the fakes.</p><h3>Ten-Tails Revival Arc</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3087373\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.60262965668371\" data-width=\"1369\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1369px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3087373\"><img alt=\"Konoha Ninja Attack the Ten Tails\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg 1369w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg 960w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Konoha Ninja Attack the Ten Tails\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg 1369w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg 960w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3087373-untitled-3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Konoha Ninja Attack the Ten Tails</figcaption></figure><p>The Shinobi Alliance had unified behind Naruto after dealing with all the White Zetsu clones. He was already in a heated fight with<a href=\"/tobi/4005-45000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45000\"> Obito Uchiha</a>, who had been impersonating Madara; and the real <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/madara-uchiha/4005-80827/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80827\">Madara Uchiha</a> as they were beginning to revive the <a href=\"/juubi/4005-80001/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80001\">Ten Tails</a>. Ino was able to capture Obito and force him to divert the Ten Tails attack to save their lives, but he quickly broke free. During the battle, Shikamaru and Ino both lost their fathers when Obito later targeted the base they were located at. Through Ino's father, they had both spoke to Ino and Shikamaru to pass on their final words along with a battle plan. </p><p>When the previous revived Hokage appeared with Sasuke, they all banded together to stop the Ten-Tails. Ino, Shikamaru, and Choji combined tier forces. As Naruto, Sasuke, and the Hokages took the lead in the battle. Ino used her abilities to help Shikamaru relay messages to the Shinobi Alliance.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Ino is a specialist in the clan jutsu known as 'The Mind body switch technique (Shintenshin no Jutsu)' which is a guarded secret of her clan (the Yamanaka).</p><p><strong>Mind And Body Transfer Jutsu</strong></p><p>She also possesses a technique that allows her to manipulate her opponents in any way she wishes: including making them attack their own allies.

    "deck": "Choji is a member of the Akimichi clan who use their size to their advantage. He loves eating and is very picky about the fact that he is fat. He is a reliable ninja and cares for his friends the most, notably Shikamaru Nara.",
    "description": "<h2>Background</h2><p> </p><p>When Chōji was younger, he was often put down for not being good at a child's game called \"<i>Ninja</i>\", which appears to be a cross between tag and hide and seek, often using shuriken made out of cardboard. His peers were always berating him, telling him that any team that he was on was bound to lose. One day, they simply refused to let him play at all. Chōji and his father were later seen talking on the roof of a building where Chōji was still upset over the way he was treated by the other children. His father told him that few people have a heart as kind and caring as his, and one day he would meet someone who would see that in him and respect him for it, and that eventually they would be the best of friends. Soon after, Shikamaru walked up the stairs. Chōji recognized him as the one who had defended him earlier. He asked Shikamaru why he wasn't playing the game, to which Shikamaru responded that it was a drag. He then told Chōji that he liked to come up there to watch the clouds and that Chōji happened to be sitting in his spot. Chōji moved over to give him room. Shikamaru proceeded to lie down before telling Chōji that he should watch the clouds with him. This delighted Chōji, and he eagerly asked Shikamaru if he wanted to eat some snacks that he had brought. Shikamaru took him up on the offer, causing Chōji to be overjoyed, then Shikamaru said \"This is the best, watching clouds and eating chips\". From that day on, the two became best friends. </p><p> </p><h2>Personality</h2><p> Chōji is a very kind, polite, and caring person. These characteristics are said to be his greatest strength by both his father and his teacher. He is easily motivated by the prospect of food, and becomes highly agitated when somebody calls him \"fat\" (he refers to himself as \"big boned\", \"chubby\", or \"pleasingly plump\"). However, he does not hide his love for food and his near constant hunger is also an annoyance to his team-mates, as eating often comes before other necessities such as stealth and teamwork. Food can also make him over-react about silly things, such as who gets the last piece of meat, or when Akamaru tried to take his food, and he refuses to let anyone else eat the last chip in the bag. Chōji has a long-standing friendship with Shikamaru. The two have complete trust in each other, with Shikamaru being one of the few people to look past Chōji's lack of athleticism, and see that he had a kind heart; recognizing Chōji's true strength. Because of this, Chōji has unconditional faith and loyalty to Shikamaru and, if necessary, would give his life for him. </p><p> </p><h2>Appearance</h2><p> Chōji has brown hair, swirl marks on his cheeks, and like the rest of his clan, he has a much more robust physique than most other ninja. Since his childhood, he has always been quite husky which is a necessity in his clan to perform their techniques since they convert calories to chakra. During Part I, Chōji's wore grey shorts, a rather long white scarf, a short-sleeved green jacket over a white shirt with his clan's emblem on it, ring earrings, and his legs and forearms were wrapped in bandages. His forehead protector was also worn on a bandanna around his head.During Part II, he sports a red top with armour on his torso, arms, and upper legs, similar to his father. On the front of his chest armour is the obligatory kanji for \"eat\". His brown hair has grown much longer and he also changes his earrings from hoops to the studs that he got as a gift from Asuma.</p><p>During the Chuunin Exams, Choji did not make it through after fighting a Dosu. Choji helps Shikamaru train for the finals of the Chunin Exam.</p><p> </p><p>Shikamaru recruits Choji along with Neji, Kiba and Akamaru, and Naruto to go on a mission to retrieve Sasuke from the Sound Four, servants of Orochimaru. When they find them they become trapped in a rock dome by Jirobo. From instructions from Shikamaru, Choji uses the Human Boulder Jutsu on the weakest point on the dome setting them free. Choji then battles Jirobo while the other four go after the rest of the Sound Four and Sasuke. When he battled Jirobo, Choji uses the Akimichi clans special pills. The first one he uses is green. This increases his strength. Next he uses the yellow pill increasing his strength even more. Last is red. This increased his strength 100 times. This also makes him skinnier and chakra butterfly wings. He then kills Jirobo but this leaves him unconscious.</p><p> </p><h2>The Search for Sasuke</h2><p> </p><p>When Shikamaru asked Choji to come along to find Sasuke he agreed. Later, Shikamaru makes a speech of him not being lazy and him being a leader. Choji knew he wasn’t bluffing. On the way they saw many traps and they catch up to Orochimaru's followers. The followers of Orochimaru catch them and thinks their all weak. Shikamaru uses shadow possession jutsu, and catches them all. But, the follower from the west gate also knew the shadow possession jutsu and broke the jutsu. They south gate follower comes and uses a jutsu that traps them in a rock wall. The wall was draining there chalkra. The team kept trying and trying to break out but, the walls repaired itself. Then Shikamaru figures out that in the back wall it recovers the slowest so he knew someone with great Taijutsu can break it. Choji uses a jutsu that makes him look like a giant ball and he says:</p><p> </p><p>\"Bah-Ruu! Bah-Ruu!, Bah-Ruu!\"</p><p> </p><p>Soon as they get out Naruto and Akaramu head for an attack, and they were beaten. Choji seemed like the only one who could beat him. Choji tells the others too catch up to Sasuke and he'll handle this guy. the others go of. Choji is winning at first but, the south gate follower used his cures mark level one. He is beating up Choji. Choji takes out these pills that are green, yellow, and red.</p><p> </p><p><b>Choji vs Jirobo</b></p><p>Choji eats the green one. Choji is still losing the fight, then he takes the yellow one. Then the southgate follower takes it too the next level and turns red and has longer hair, he turns into level two. He is beating him and mocking, and talking about his friends, and he eats the last chip of his favorite chip bag Choji opens the red pill. he says to himself:</p><p> </p><p>\"I can't beat him if I don't take the pill, but if I do then I'll die.\"</p><p> </p><p>He takes the pill. He changes his form, he becomes more skinnier and has now butterfly wings. He beats him up. Choji then focuses his chakra to his left hand and punches him in the stomach. Choji is tired and about to die, then he spots a butterfly and follows it and sees a tree with directions of were the group left, and their is a note. Choji remembers what his father said when he was younger, and knows that he has great friends.</p><p> </p><h2>Hidan and kakuzu Arc</h2><p> </p><p> Chōji arrived with Ino as back-up for Shikamaru and Asuma in their fight with Akasuki members Hidan and Kakuzu. As the Akatsuki pair fled due to their arrival, Chōji prepared to take the fatally injured Asuma back to Konoha for treatment. Asuma, however, knew that he wouldn't make it back to Konoha, and gave some parting words to his team. He told Chōji that he was a kind-hearted boy, who thinks about his friends, and, therefore, may be a stronger ninja than anyone else, and to simply believe in himself. Asuma also told Chōji to diet a bit more, and Chōji said that, while it was difficult, he would try. Chōji then reminisces his memories with Asuma like the day when they were assigned to him as students and he treated them for a meal and Chōji had ordered a banquet, which hurt Asuma's economy. Chōji then cried. After smoking one last cigarette, Asuma died, leaving Chōji, Shikamaru, and Ino to set out in an attempt to avenge him.</p><p>When the remaining members of Team 10 distracted Hidan and Kakuzu, Chōji attacked the two with his spiked human bullet tamk , its effectiveness increased with his new ability to grow and sharpen his hair. Later, when Kakuzu's masks charged at Chōji and his team, Chōji used mega palm thrust to crush the masks and keep them at bay. His attempt was unsuccessful, and Kakuzu was able to pin him down.</p><p> </p><p>Later, after Naruto arrived and defeated Kakuzu, Chōji returned to Konoha with the rest of his team, noting that Naruto's defeating Kakuzu made him \"cool\", even if not as much so as Shikamaru.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers/Techniques</h2><p>As an Akimichi, Chōji uses the calories he eats and converts them to chakra in order to perform his technique which is the primary reason for his as well as the members of his clan's physical size. Chōji's most pronounced ability is his tremendous physical strength, being the physically strongest member of the Konoha 11. Shikamaru hinted at Chōji's raw power during the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, but it wasn't until he broke them out of Jirōbō's domee that the rest of Sasuke retrieval team believed him. He is also proficient in taijutsu, as seen when he flipped Jirobo, a skilled practitioner of the art, over without seeming to use much effort. He is not, however, particularly fast in his movements.</p><p>As an Akimichi, Chōji knows various secret jutsu that allow him to expand body parts to several times their normal size, the most common of which is the multi-size technique . He uses this to perform his human bullet tank attack, where he turns himself into a giant ball and attacks opponents by running them over, shouting \"<i>roll</i>\" repeatedly as he does. He can also add spikes to this attack to make it more damaging with a chain of kunai. He can also use the partial multi-size technique to expand his arms and legs as well as other body parts.After the time skip, Chōji's Spiked Human Bullet Tank does not involve kunai wrapped around him, but instead involves a technique that hardens his hair into extremely sharp spikes that cover his body, similar to Jiraiya 's needle jezo technique, after which Chōji spins rapidly. Also, Chōji no longer needs to take any pills to perform the partial multi-size technique . He recently learned calorie control technique which allows him to grow his chakra wings without using the colored pills.</p>",

    "deck": "Straw Man is a powerful being who lives in his own dimension inside of a painting.  He was one of the founding Fear Lords, but he betrayed them on their first moment of action.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4744/126949-173174-straw-man.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4744/126949-173174-straw-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4744/126949-173174-straw-man.jpg\"></a></figure><p>Although Straw Man appears to be an evil demon that causes fear and wreaks havoc, he is actually a fairly peaceful creature who brings fear to mortals for their own entertainment, hence his creation of HTV, or \"Horror Television.\" Straw Man lives in a mystic dimension within an ancient painting, which has been passed around between many owners, beginning with a religious leader of the Cult of <a href=\"/kalumai/4005-57210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57210\">Kalumai</a> and ultimately ending in the ownership of Dr. Strange. When the religious leader of the Cult of Kalumai retired from his position and abandoned his religion, he donated the painting to a museum. Members of the cult later broke into the museum to steal the painting, shooting and killing the guard in the process. With the death of the guard, Straw Man emerged from the painting and killed the cultists.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Staw Man (first known as Scarecrow) was created by Scott Edelman and Rico Rival and first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/dead-of-night-11-enter-the-scarecrow/4000-15474/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dead of Night issue 11</a> (1975).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Out Again</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2156870-straw_man_name_clarification_doctor_strange_38.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2156870-straw_man_name_clarification_doctor_strange_38.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2156870-straw_man_name_clarification_doctor_strange_38.jpg\"></a></figure><p>The museum afterwards put the painting up for auction, where there was a fierce bidding war between a man named Jess Duncan and the maniacal leader of the Cult of Kalumai, Gregor Rovik. Rovik would have one, had Jess's brother Dave not sharply jabbed Rovik in the side with his fist at the right moment, not allowing him to outbid Jess. Angered by the loss, Rovik and his cult mugged the brothers, stole the painting, and kidnapped a friend of the brothers', Harmony Maxwell, to sacrifice for the cult beliefs. Straw Man once again emerged from the painting, killing all the present cult members and Rovik, and later returning Harmony to her rightful place. Throughout the years, Straw Man had many encounters with the Cult of Kalumai, but always defeated them, and, ultimately, wiped out the cult for good.</p><h3>Fear Lords</h3><p>When the <a href=\"/dweller-in-darkness/4005-13999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13999\">Dweller In Darkness</a> called the most powerful creatures to his lair to form the <a href=\"/fear-lords/4060-28159/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-28159\">Fear Lords</a> to take over earth, Straw Man warned him against it, claiming he saw the planet as a home. Straw Man later contacted <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a> to inform him of the evil plan. The <a href=\"/lurking-unknown/4005-27818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27818\">Lurking Unknown</a> then appeared and set fire to the building Straw Man was in, rendering his physical straw body a pile of ash near instantly. Straw Man returned later to aid Dr. Strange in his battle against the remaining Fear Lords with his spiritual form contained in the body of <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>. He, along with <a href=\"/clea/4005-2216/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2216\">Clea</a>, <a href=\"/rintrah/4005-14794/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14794\">Rintrah</a>, and Dr. Strange ultimately defeated the Fear Lords and brought the earth back to safety.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Straw Man has demonstrated many various powers, and has shown complete knowledge and control over them all. He has shown the ability to animate any painting, especially things painted on the canvas of the portal to his mystical domain. He often animates tree roots and crows to serve his purpose. Although he is inevitably weak to fire, his spritual essence is thought to be immortal. Whenever his physical body is destroyed, he simply goes back to his mystic home and restores his energy, only to return a few days later. All of his powers seem to be mystically based.</p>",
