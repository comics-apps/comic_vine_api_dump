    "deck": "A Dark god that was released from imprisonment after millions of years. \"The Dark God Urizen older than memories, older than words.\"",
    "description": "<h2>Origins</h2><p>At the beginning of time Urizen was one of the missing threads in the universe who ruled along with the other Elder Gods who together brought balance to the universe. Urizen was one of these Elder Gods, a great deity that existed before even <a href=\"/heaven/4020-42470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42470\">Heaven</a> and <a href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">Hell</a>. His sole duty was to consume souls, freeing them from the wheel of life and death and perpetuating conflict as a means of cleansing the universe. The easiest way to maintain peace is to destroy those who created conflict or to have them destroy themselves. Urizen represents balance in that he ends existence. This frustrated the upstart factions of both Heaven and Hell and kept both sides in weakened conditions. They're armies needed souls in order to increase their ranks. Urizen was a direct threat to this need. As long as he was free to roam the universe neither side could gain an upper hand over the other. Thus they teamed together for the first time and defeated Urizen banishing him from this level of reality, the only thing that they could do to him since he was truly an immortal.</p><h2>The Cult of Urizen</h2><p>A cult that devoted itself to Urizen and attempted to harness his power and bring about his return. They felt that there was a lack of a balancing force between Heaven and Hell and that in the absence of this force Urizen would rise to fill that void. It all began with a series of ceremonies which began with 13 souls and during each full moon one member of the group was chosen as the sacrifice. The sacrifice would be hunted down by the group, killed, and then eaten in a cannibalistic ritual. The act of consuming the sacrifice was supposed to fuse their souls together and the goal was to continue until only one soul remained, which would be the vessel through which Urizen would someday return. However, the ceremony was interrupted when <a href=\"/spawn/4005-3381/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3381\">Spawn</a> found out and altered the current sacrifice with his magic. When they consumed their friend the remaining members of the cult began to vomit up their own organs, insects and bile which lead to the death of the remaining, ending the threat. Or so it seemed.</p><h2>The release of Urizen</h2><p>Unknown to Spawn, someone else had a plan for Urizen. Two minor Gate-opener demons, <a href=\"/ab/4005-49990/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49990\">Ab</a> and <a href=\"/zab/4005-49991/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49991\">Zab</a>, were sent to earth and possessed the bodies of two murderers who died in a car crash that Spawn had caused outside the town of Malice, Pennsylvania. They went to a nearby diner and waited until they had 13 innocents to sacrifice. They executed them and then took them to a nearby hill where they painted a mystical emblem on the ground and burned the bodies, completing an opening spell that released Urizen from his banishment and allowed him to return through the smoke. As they worked they referenced that Urizen had been forgotten over time. Only a few really knew of his existence, and only limited information. William Blake was one such person and he wrote about him in The Book of Urizen, but like the cult most of what Blake believed was wrong.</p><p>Spawn sensed that a great power had arisen and headed to face Urizen, but was easily defeated. Urizen had nailed Spawn to the Earth with a sign and Spawn was then pulled into Greenworld where he was given a gift of great power with which he could defeat Urizen with when he returned to Earth. <a href=\"/angela/4005-11761/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11761\">Angela</a> was there when Spawn awoke, eager to aid him in his fight. She had captured the demons Ab and Zab and had found out what they were up to. Meanwhile, Urizen was laying waste to the land and the forces of Heaven were about to go to Earth to stop him. This would have jump started the Apocalypse, because it would have also permitted Hell to invade earth. Angela went to stop the Angels while Spawn fought Urizen. Angela returned, and Spawn used his new powers to create a wall of trees to slow Urizen down.Urizen was defeated With the Chains of Hell, the Ribbons of Heaven and the Gift of The Greenworld (a powerful necroplasmic blast charged with the four forces of nature) and the Earth opened up to swallow and imprison him. Interrogation of Ab and Zab led Spawn and Angela to find that <a href=\"/malebolgia/4005-4957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4957\">Malebolgia</a> had been the one who had sent them on their mission in the hopes that he would draw Heaven into the war early, since his army was far larger and more powerful. This led to the confrontation between Spawn, Angela and Malebolgia that would lead to Angela's and Malebogia's death. Leaving Spawn to rule <a href=\"/the-eighth-sphere-of-hell/4020-49825/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-49825\">The Eighth Sphere of Hell</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Possessed by the Black God</h2><p>After Spawn and Angela had used their combined powers to encase Urizen within the Earth he was thought to be defeated. However his hand was encased in stone and stuck out from the spot where he was swallowed and was deemed a natural landmark called The Demon’s Right Hand. Preston Miller and his two brothers were playing at The Hand one day when Preston stepped on something sharp. It appeared to be a small black rock that bore into his foot, but really it was a piece of the god himself. The Miller Boys were possessed by the spirit of Urizen, through the minute piece that lived inside Preston. He was filled with all of the Dark God’s knowledge, especially the events that occurred in Malice. Urizen amplified their cruelty and caused them to taunt and harass a boy at school they called “Piggy.” They captured him, tied him up in a barn and were ready to slit his throat when Spawn arrived. Preston began to transform into a pig-like beast and screamed,</p><p>\"I am The Void. I am The Night. I am The Wolf that hunts the child in the crib. I am The Darkness that knows no dawn. You are the door. You are the gate through which my thunders shall pass. I am the cold breath of The Grave. I am The Eater of Worlds. I am The Destroyer. I shall bury you.\"</p><p>Realizing what had possessed Preston he then used his powers to tear the shard of Urizen out of Preston’s chest and presumably obliterated it. Whether he destroyed it or teleported it back to Urizen’s prison is unknown.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Urizen has many powers due to his being a supreme deity. His size increases as he consumes souls which are negated as they become part of him and he has an ability to spread malice in the souls of man and release them of their inhibitions so that they might commit horrific deeds. He also has the abilities to disappear into a cloud of smoke and appears in a similar form upon his release. He has the ability to possess beings of whom he comes in contact with. The Greenworld fears his very presence on the Earth because his very existence in this realm poisons the planet itself. Since he is a God he is immortal and cannot be killed. The only way to stop him is to imprison him with powers from Heaven, Hell and Earth.</p>",

Interrupting the meeting of HIVE and suffering at the wraith of some of the super powered members, including <a href=\"/osiris/4005-23063/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23063\">Osiris</a>, she teleported herself away. She discovered Madame Xanadu dying, and cradled her in her arms in her final moments.</p><p>Now, travelling across the world and visiting various people across its surface, she begins to understand the cryptic message that Madame Xanadu gave her as she died. She travels across the face of the Flashpoint world meeting <a href=\"/red-tornado/4005-1688/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1688\">Red Tornado</a>, <a href=\"/natasha-irons/4005-10019/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10019\">Natasha Irons</a>, <a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd</a>, <a href=\"/beast-boy/4005-3586/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3586\">Beast Boy</a>, <a href=\"/guy-gardner/4005-1791/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\">Guy Gardner</a> and <a href=\"/circe/4005-10924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10924\">Circe</a> before eventually surfacing in the middle of the climactic battle between Aquaman and Wonder Woman. It's here she discovers that her father has been using and learning magic as well.</p><p>In an attempt to prevent her from dying at the hands of his Satellite laser array, <a href=\"/doctor-terry-thirteen/4005-37525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37525\">Doctor Thirteen</a> fights against Traci, but ultimately, by tapping into the power of the Earth and the people she met on her travels, Traci is able to cure her father of his malicious intent, as well as reconcile their relationship. Using this opportunity to redeem himself, Doctor Thirteen uses the last of his magical abilities to fly into space and destroy the Satellite array. However, when he thought himself dead, Traci manages to snatch him from death and teleport him back to Earth, where they would continue their lives away from the madness of HIVE and heroes and villains.</p><h2><b>Powers and Abilities</b></h2><p>Traci Thirteen has \"urban magic\" and can tap into the magic of cities to cast spells, teleport , fire blasts of magic energy, create mystic force shields, and can even transform her pet iguana, <a href=\"/leroy/4005-80779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80779\">Leroy</a>, into a dragon. During her tenure in the <i>Blue Beetle</i> series she shows increased proficiency in any kind of magic, becoming able to teleport, conjure simple items and clothing, using her astral projection to communicate with distant people and access to magic spells unrelated to the urban setting, as a full blown member of the <i>Homo Magi</i> race. It is known that Traci is highly experience in witchcraft, as she practice it often, making her knowledge on occults higher than those of teenaged magic practitioners such as <a href=\"/zachary-zatara/4005-46846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46846\">Zachary Zatara</a> and <a href=\"/black-alice/4005-41210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41210\">Black Alice</a> had no clue on any gods to invoke which Traci replied \"Great, you use magic but don't practice it.\".</p>",

Along with his three-year-old son, Daigorō, they seek revenge on the Yagyū clan and are known as \"Lone Wolf and Cub\".</p><h2>Origin</h2><blockquote><p><em>\"You're a holy terror, Ogami Itto!

Along with the oniwaban and the assassins, Ogami Ittō is responsible for enforcing the will of the Shogun over the daimyō (lesser domain lords). For those samurai and lords ordered to commit seppuku, the Kogi Kaishakunin assists their deaths by decapitating them to relieve the agony of disembowelment; in this role, he is entitled and empowered to wear the crest of the Shogunate, in effect acting in place of the Shogun.</p><p>After Ogami Ittō's wife Azami gives birth to their son, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daigoro/4005-19738/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19738\">Daigorō</a>, Ogami Ittō returns to find her and all of their household brutally murdered, with only the newborn Daigorō surviving. The supposed culprits are three former retainers of an abolished clan, avenging the execution of their lord by Ogami Ittō. However, the entire matter was planned by Ura-Yagyū (Shadow Yagyu) <a href=\"/yagyu-retsudo/4005-107933/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-107933\">Yagyū Retsudō</a>, leader of the Ura-Yagyū clan, in order to seize Ogami's post as part of a masterplan to control the three key positions of power: the spy system, the official assassins and the Shogunate Decapitator.</p><p>During the initial incursion, an ihai (funeral tablet) with the shogun's crest on it was placed inside the Ogami family shrine, signifying a supposed wish for the shogun's death. When the tablet is \"discovered\" during the murder investigation, its presence condemns Ittō as a traitor and thus he is forced to forfeit his post.</p><p>The one-year-old Daigorō is given a choice by his father: a ball or a sword. If Daigorō chose the ball, his father would kill him, sending Daigorō to be with his mother; however, the child crawls toward the sword and reaches for its hilt. This assigns him the path of a rōnin, wandering the country with his father as \"demons\"—the assassin-for-hire team that becomes known as <em>Lone Wolf and Cub</em>, vowing to destroy the Yagyū clan to avenge Azami's death and Ittō's disgrace.</p><h3>Lone Wolf &amp; Cub</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"They will pay... in rivers of blood!\"</em></p> --Ogami Itto</blockquote><p>On <i>meifumadō</i> (\"The Road to Hell\"), the cursed journey for vengeance, Ogami Ittō and Daigorō experience numerous adventures, encountering (and slaying) all of Yagyū Retsudō's children and the entire Kurokuwa ninja clan, and eventually facing Retsudō himself. The first duel between Ogami Ittō and Yagyū Retsudō runs 178 pages—one of the longest single fight-scenes ever published in comics.</p><p>Toward the end of their journeys, Ogami Ittō's dōtanuki sword is surreptitiously damaged by a supposed sword-polisher who is really an elite \"Grass\" ninja of the Yagyū clan. When attacked by the last of the \"Grass\" ninja, the sword breaks due to Yagyū tampering, and Ittō receives wounds that are ultimately fatal. Deadlocked in mid-battle with Retsudō, Ittō's spirit leaves his body after a lifetime of fatigue and bloodshed, unable to destroy his longtime enemy and ending his path of meifumadō.</p><p>The story finishes with Daigorō taking up Retsudō's spear and charging in fury. Retsudō opens his arms, disregarding all defense, and allows Daigorō to drive the spear into his body. Embracing Daigorō with tears, Yagyū Retsudō names him, <em>\"Grandson of my heart\"</em>, closing the cycle of vengeance and hatred between the clans.</p><h2>Skills and Abilities</h2><h3>Suio-ryu</h3><p>Kazuo Koike utilized the name of the Suio ryu for the style of swordsmanship practiced by the protagonist of the series, Ogami Ittō, purely based on the romantic sound of the name. After learning of its actual existence he visited the headquarters of the tradition in Shizuoka, called the Hekiunkan, to pay his respects.</p><p>Later, the fight choreographer of the second series of the TV show, featuring <a title=\"Yorozuya Kinnosuke\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorozuya_Kinnosuke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yorozuya Kinnosuke</a>, visited the Hekiunkan and impressed with the movements of the tradition spent some time learning the kata of the school.

He took in a recently orphaned mouse named Leito and raised him as his son and made him his apprentice. He told Leito stories of the Templar and secretly trained him to be one.</p><p>When Pilot the Tall comes to his store hinting that he is also a Templar, Deishun turns him away, not wanting to bring trouble to the peaceful village. Soon after an army of rats attack the village looking for remaining Templars and Deishun is slain while defending the villagers. His sword is taken up by Leito, but he is no match for the Rat leader Captain Tosk, who swiftly cuts his arm off. Leito is taken as a slave and Deishun's sword is brought to the Mouse King Icarus in Dealrach Ard-Vac.</p>",

Unfortunately for him, the politicians of the city had become increasingly corrupt, making it nearly impossible to deal with criminals through legal means.  <br /> <br />One day while investigating a train wreck, because that apparently is  what assistant district attorneys in Rapid Falls do, Dennis Burton  discovered that the wheels of the engine had been purposely sabotaged  with acid. Burton disguised himself as an oiler and went to the railyard  where he discovered two men tampering with the trains. Burton removed  his oiler disguise and followed the men to their hideout where he  discovered a large gathering of gangsters under Lester Deeks. The  gangsters overpowered Burton and Deeks had him put into the attic.  Burton managed to escape and donned his Laughing Mask costume. He then  cut the lights in the hideout and lowered a second, glowing mask into  the room the gangsters were meeting in to create confusion. He then  slaughtered the gangsters and raced to the trainyard to prevent the next  train from being sabotaged. Laughing Mask was able to prevent the acid  from damaging the train's wheels and managed to stop the train before it  reached the Rapid Falls bridge, which had been rigged to explode.  Laughing Mask then executed the remaining gangsters save for one who he  had sign a confession before dropping him off at a police station. In order to fight crime the only way possible, Burton remained with the persona of the Laughing Mask, and became a masked vigilante. As the Laughing Mask, Burton hunted down criminals and brutally killed them.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Laughing Mask was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-58798\" href=\"/will-harr/4040-58798/\">    Will Harr</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-43720\" href=\"/maurice-gutwirth/4040-43720/\">    Maurice Gutwirth</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>\"Mystery of the Swabert Mansion\"</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/835270-purple.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-835270\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.52989130434783\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/835270-purple.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-835270\"><img alt=\"Barton as The Purple Mask\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35816/835270-purple.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/835270-purple.jpg 1104w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/35816/835270-purple.jpg 960w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35816/835270-purple.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Barton as The Purple Mask</figcaption></figure><p>After some fighting crime as the Laughing Mask for some period of time, Burton retired the Laughing Mask persona and became the more conventional Purple Mask. The reason for the change is unknown. Sometime later, Burton and Police Commissioner Herrick learn that businessman Frederick Swabert had received a threatening letter demanding to know the location of his father's fortune. Swabert explained that his father did not trust banks and had hidden the money away in secret vaults beneath the house that even Frederick did not know the location of.</p> <p>Burton quickly realizes that the plans for the Swabert Mansion must have been in a planbook that was recently stolen from an architect, and confirms with his friend William Grant of the National Bank, that the only one with access to the plans was a man named Renard. As the Purple Mask, Burton breaks into Renard's apartment to find that Renard and a gangster named Maurice Bellos were behind the threats. The Purple Mask rushed to the Swabert Mansion, arriving just in time to save Frederick from poisonous gas that was spewing from his telephone. The Purple Mask followed the wire into another room were he discovered Bellos and quickly dispatched of him with his gun.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, The Purple Mask encountered Renard and his goons and a deadly shootout ensued. During the firefight, a stray bullet hit a secret switch opening up a concealed door. Renard and his henchman ran through it finding the Swabert treasure in a locked chest surrounded by a moat of acid. The Purple Mask was hot on their heels and in the fight that followed, Renard's henchman fell into the acid moat and perished. The Purple Mask then threatened to toss Renard into the acid as well. This proved too much for Renard to bear and he confessed to everything.</p><h3>\"Busting a Banker\"</h3><p>Burton happened upon a daring daylight bank robbery, and pursued the robbers to a farmhouse on the outskirts of town. Burton then purchases a wagon and disguises himself as a farmer so he could get close to the thieves' hideout and sneak inside. Barton overhears the crooks plotting to leave the farmhouse, so Burton changes into his Purple Mask costume and ambushes the crooks, but they are able to get the drop on him and knock him out with a chair before escaping. The next day in Burton meets with the sickly Mr. Whalen, the owner of the First National Bank that was robbed the day before. Burton rides along with Whalen to the scene of the crime listening about how ill Whalen is before he noticed that Whalen's driver was one of the criminals from the farmhouse. Burton says nothing, but later follows the driver who leads him to the bank robbers' new hideout. Burton realizes that the robbers must be working with Whalen when he hears them mention meeting their boss at the same southern retreat where Whalen said he was going to go to recover from his illness.</p> <p>Burton rushes ahead, taking the same train as Whalen and then poses as a waiter at the hotel. Burton then changes into his Purple Mask costume and attacks the bank robbers when they arrive. He beats them senseless and locked them in the room while he went to get the police. By the time they had returned, the criminals had escaped out the window. The Purple Mask chased them down on his motorcycle, causing their car to crash which allowed them to be captured by the authorities. The next day Burton handed over the money to the District Attorney, telling him he had received it from Purple Mask.</p><h3>World War II</h3><p>Burton would return to his Laughing Mask persona sometime after capturing the bank robbers and joined with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\">    Captain America</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-25865\" href=\"/invaders/4060-25865/\">    The Invaders</a>, and assorted other superheroes to fight in the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56636\" href=\"/the-battle-of-berlin/4045-56636/\">    Battle of Berlin</a>.</p><h3>The Twelve</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/173349-15962-laughing-mask.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-173349\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/173349-15962-laughing-mask.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-173349\"><img alt=\"The Laughing Mask\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/173349-15962-laughing-mask.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/173349-15962-laughing-mask.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Laughing Mask\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/173349-15962-laughing-mask.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/173349-15962-laughing-mask.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Laughing Mask</figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-46338\" href=\"/rockman/4005-46338/\">    Rockman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46444\" href=\"/fiery-mask/4005-46444/\">    Fiery Mask</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46270\" href=\"/witness/4005-46270/\">    Witness</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46234\" href=\"/black-widow/4005-46234/\">    Black Widow</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48325\" href=\"/mastermind-excello/4005-48325/\">    Mastermind Excello</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46577\" href=\"/dynamic-man/4005-46577/\">    Dynamic Man</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61016\" href=\"/mister-e/4005-61016/\">    Mister E</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46390\" href=\"/captain-wonder/4005-46390/\">    Captain Wonder</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46271\" href=\"/blue-blade/4005-46271/\">    Blue Blade</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47069\" href=\"/electro/4005-47069/\">    Electro</a> went into an SS headquarters in Berlin and discovered a secret, underground chamber. The heroes were trapped in the chamber and Electro shut down when the signal that controlled him could not penetrate that far beneath the ground. The rest of the Twelve were gassed by German scientists and placed inside freezing tubes to be studied and dissected at a later date. However, certain parts of Berlin were seized by the Russians and most of the scientist were either killed or placed in prison camps. The Twelve would lay dormant in suspended animation for years. On August the second, 2008 the basement of the SS bunker was discovered during constructionworks on the sight and the heroes were discovered to still be alive, frozen inside their tubes. The Pentagon brought them over to America and defrosted them, asking them to work for the government once again, openly this time as the <a href=\"../../super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\" rel=\"nofollow\">    Super- Human Registration Act</a> was in effect.</p><p>For every hero, it was a major adjustment to wake up 'in the future,' more then 60 year after they where frozen. More so perhaps for the Laughing Mask, because not soon after he had been defrosted, he was arrested for murder. It turned out that, some 60 years ago, he had killed a few mobsters as the Laughing Mask. Police found some of the bullets that Laughing Mask had fired during one of his heroics in the present day. They matched the ones that where found on the crime scene more then 60 years ago. And although it was the murder of a gangster, it was still murder. He would now finally stand trial for his so-called crimes. Luckily, another teammate of the Twelve, Mastermind Excello managed the police to drop the charges for the moment and got him free. <br /> <br /> It   was however not soon after that a disturbing phone-call came in; Laughing Mask's teammate Blue Blaze had been killed, and it seemed that the  lifeless robot  Electro was to blame for it. Electro however could only be controlled  through a control panel, and nobody was at the panel at the moment that  the robot killed Blue Blaze. Eventually, Phantom Reporter brought the  remaining Twelve members  together to expose the murderer. He revealed that Electro's control  helmet revealed to him that Electro had been searching for contact while  the twelve slept. It had made contact with the synthetic brain of  Dynamic man. This enebled Dynamic Man to control Electro. Richard  revealed that Dynamic man used Electro to murder several people  including Blue Blade. Dynamic man snapped and destroyed the mansion the  Twelve were staying in.  Durnig the ensuing battle Firey Mask  was killed but was able to pass his powers to Phantom Reporter (as they  were passed to him). Phantom Repoter used his powers to incinerate  Dynamic man and permantly scarred Captain Wonder in the process.<br />  <br />After their confrontation with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46577\" href=\"/dynamic-man/4005-46577/\">    Dynamic Man</a>, the remaining members of the Twelve scattered for good. Laughing Mask managed to make a deal with the U.S. Government to get the murder-charges dropped for good, if he in return would be willing to operate the robot Electro for them. This was because only he and other Twelve members where able to operate it thanks to their connection with it for 60 long years. Dennis accepted and became the new operator of the robot, hunting down terrorists and in the proces, once again, started working for the U.S. Government.<br /></p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Dennis has no real super powers. But, he is strong and athletic. He is a very good fighter. Also he is a master of disguise. He uses guns and a motorcycle.</p><p>He is quite ugly, which is why he wears a mask, and the Laughing Mask mask would scare people very easily.</p>",

After being activated, Dynamic Man decided to use his powers for justice and flies to civilization, not knowing himself to be an android and not an actual human being. He started out fighting petty thieves and minor gang members and the mob. Eventually Dynamic Man managed to join the F.B.I and later even helped the US Army in the fight against the Nazis.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Twelve</h3><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/174789-148017-dynamic-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-174789\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3375\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/174789-148017-dynamic-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-174789\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1867/174789-148017-dynamic-man.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/174789-148017-dynamic-man.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1867/174789-148017-dynamic-man.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During World War II, Dynamic Man helped the superhero group known as the <a href=\"../../invaders/65-25865/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Invaders</a> fight the Nazi's in Europe, as did most other heroes. While fighting the war, a group of twelve superhero's, including Dynamic Man, formed when they entered a headquarters of the SS in Berlin. It was a random group with the heroes who were nearest to the building and wanted to check out if they could find anything inside the building to help the war effort. During they're inspection of the building however, the heroes were trapped by Nazis in a basement and put to cold sleep, for studying after the war. Things however turned out different then the Nazis had hoped. The Axis didn't win the war, and the secret basement was forgotten in time. Nothing was heard from the twelve heroes from that point on. On August the second, 2008 the basement of the SS bunker was discovered during construction works on the sight and the heroes were discovered to still be alive, frozen inside their tubes. The Pentagon brought them over to America and defrosted them, asking them to work for the government once again, openly this time as the <a href=\"../../super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Super- Human Registration Act</a> was in effect.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At first it seemed that Dynamic Man had adjusted quickly to the change in eras and quickly registered as part of <a href=\"/the-initiative/4060-42781/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42781\"> The Initiative</a>, as well as once again joining the F.B.I. However, after a confrontation with <a href=\"/captain-wonder/4005-46390/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46390\"> Captain Wonder</a> it appears that Dynamic Man is also out of his depth, confused with how humanity has degraded and embraced his alias as The Man of Tomorrow to hide these facts.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Despite embracing the name The Man of Tomorrow, Dynamic Man seems to display certain homophobic tendencies in constantly referring to other men as pansies and questioning their sexuality, such as his own team mate the <a href=\"/blue-blade/4005-46271/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46271\"> Blue Blade</a>. He was also confused when chasing down a mugger that the victim was married to a black person, and instantly assumed that he was responsible for the crime.</p><h3>No Man of Tomorrow</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It was however not soon after that a disturbing phone-call came in; Black Widow's teammate Blue Blade had been killed, and it seemed that the lifeless robot <a href=\"/electro/4005-47069/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47069\">Electro</a> was to blame for it. Eventually, <a href=\"/phantom-reporter/4005-46588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46588\">Phantom Reporter</a> brought the remaining Twelve members together to expose the murderer. He revealed that Electro's control helmet revealed to him that Electro had been searching for contact while the Twelve slept. It had made contact with the synthetic brain of Dynamic Man. This enabled Dynamic Man to control Electro. Richard revealed that Dynamic Man was actually an android and used Electro to murder several people he disliked, including Blue Blade. Dynamic Man snapped and destroyed the mansion the Twelve were staying in. Phantom Reporter, <a href=\"/mastermind-excello/4005-48325/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48325\">Mastermind Excello</a>, <a href=\"/fiery-mask/4005-46444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46444\">Fiery Mask</a> and <a href=\"/captain-wonder/4005-46390/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46390\">Captain Wonder</a> found Dynamic Man at the lab of his creator Professor Goettler. During the ensuing battle Fiery Mask was killed but was able to pass his powers to Phantom Reporter (as they were passed to him). Phantom Repoter used his powers to incinerate Dynamic Man and unluckily permanently scarred Captain Wonder in the process. The lab was destroyed so that Dynamic Man could never be created again. The man of tomorrow was now history.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Dynamic Man and his drones have the ability to Fly, Super-strength and Invulnerability.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dynamic Man is very intelligent creating all of his forces and re-shaping New York by himself.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Richard Jones was an ex-All American fullback, ex-collegiate boxing, wrestling and fencing champ. After his school career, Richard became a reporter for a new paper in New York City. He was however repulsed by all the evil things he saw and soon decided to become a hero and fight the crime that he could only report about as a journalist. He made himself a secret identity as the Phantom Reporter. At first he fought many criminals, but soon, when the Second World War started, found himself fighting overseas against the Nazis.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Phantom Reporter was created by Mike Robard and Sam Cooper and first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/daring-mystery-comics-3-breeze-barton-in-the-mirac/4000-114119/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daring Mystery Comics issue 3</a> (1940). His character only appeared a few times before J.Michael Straczynski and Chris Weston revived and further developed the character in the pages of \"The Twelve\".</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Twelve</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/672018-phantomreporter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-672018\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.51375\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/672018-phantomreporter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-672018\"><img alt=\"The Phantom Reporter back in action\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/672018-phantomreporter.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/672018-phantomreporter.jpg 800w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/672018-phantomreporter.jpg 634w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-width=\"800\"></a><figcaption>The Phantom Reporter back in action</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During World War II, the Phantom Reporter helped the superhero group known as the <a href=\"../../invaders/65-25865/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Invaders</a> fight the Nazi's in Europe, as did most other heroes. While fighting the war, a group of twelve superhero's, including the Phantom Reporter, formed when they entered a headquarters of the SS in Berlin. It was a random group with the heroes who were nearest to the building and wanted to check out if they could find anything inside the building to help the war effort. During they're inspection of the building however, the heroes were trapped by Nazis in a basement and put to cold sleep, for studying after the war. Things however turned out different then the Nazis had hoped. The Axis didn't win the war, and the secret basement was forgotten in time. Nothing was heard from the twelve heroes from that point on. On August the second, 2008 the basement of the SS bunker was discovered during construction work on the sight and the heroes were discovered to still be alive, frozen inside their tubes. The Pentagon brought them over to America and defrosted them, asking them to work for the government once again, openly this time as the <a href=\"../../super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Super- Human Registration Act</a> was in effect.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For every hero, now collectively better known as <a href=\"../../the-twelve/65-47547/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> The Twelve</a>, it was a mayor adjustment to wake up 'in the future', more then 60 year after they where frozen. Sometime after they had been unfrozen, the Phantom Reporter was asked by the Daily Bugle to write articles for the paper. They wanted to hear from his unique point of view about how he felt about this day and age. Richard accepted and started writing, on his typewriter, about how hard it was to adjust to this time. He missed the good vibration of the 1930's where people would sit outside during hot summer nights, play ball with their sons and have good conversations . Now it was only computer games and so much anger, while people seemed to have it all.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/621554-blackwidow3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-621554\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.934554973822\" data-width=\"382\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 382px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:193.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/621554-blackwidow3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-621554\"><img alt=\"Richard and the Black Widow\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/621554-blackwidow3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/621554-blackwidow3.jpg 382w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" data-width=\"382\"></a><figcaption>Richard and the Black Widow</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Most of the heroes stayed inside a mansion that had been payed for by the US government. Inside Richard started a somewhat strange relationship with fellow Twelve member, the <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-46234/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46234\"> Black Widow</a>. A strange sexual tension between the two started. Richard however noticed she went outside during the night, and was not sure whether she was truly good or evil. Eventually the Black Widow convinced Richard and the two became even closer. Most of the heroes stayed at the mansion all the time, but Richard's teammate <a href=\"/blue-blade/4005-46271/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46271\"> Blue Blade</a> went his own way and started a television show. He did this with another member of \"The Twelve\", the robot named <a href=\"/electro/4005-47069/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47069\"> Electro</a>. It was however not soon after that Richard got a disturbing phone-call; Blue Blade had been killed, and it seemed that the lifeless robot Electro was to blame for it. Electro however could only be controlled through a control panel, and nobody was at the panel at the moment that the robot killed Blue Blade. Phantom Reporter investigated the scene and, through a device that let the person see through the eyes of Electro, he almost managed to find out the person responsible for the killing. He was however interrupted without knowing the truth, or so he told the others. He tried to make up a plan so he could stop the killer in their midst without drawing to much attention of the others.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2328603\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5305555555556\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2328603\"><img alt=\"New Costumes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg 1440w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg 627w\"><noscript><img alt=\"New Costumes\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg 1440w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/2328603-blackwidow53.jpg 627w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>New Costumes</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Eventually, Phantom Reporter brought the remaining Twelve members together to expose the murderer. He revealed that Electro's control helmet revealed to him that Electro had been searching for contact while the twelve slept. It had made contact with the synthetic brain of <a href=\"/dynamic-man/4005-46577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46577\"> Dynamic Man</a>. This enabled Dynamic Man to control Electro. Richard revealed that Dynamic Man used Electro to murder several people including Blue Blade. Dynamic Man snapped and destroyed the mansion the Twelve were staying in.

During the ensuing battle Fiery Mask was killed but was able to pass his powers to Phantom Reporter (as they were passed to him). Phantom Reporter used his powers to incinerate Dynamic Man and permanently scarred Captain Wonder in the process.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It now appears that Phantom Reporter and Black Widow work as superpowered investigators under the guidance of Mastermind Excello.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Richards does not possess any superhuman abilities but is very strong, and has a nose for investigation.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Update: the Phantom Reporter has the Flame generation powers that were possessed by Fiery Mask.

    "deck": "Kendra was the slayer activated after Buffy was killed by the master. She was trained from a young age by her watcher Sam Zabuto.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a> <p>Her parents gave her up for Slayer training at a very early age. Kendra Young did not know her own surname as she studied under her Watcher, Sam Zabuto. She is called when Buffy Summers dies at the hands of The Master in 1997; though Xander manages to revive her, Buffy's death nevertheless activates a second Slayer, causing two to exist. Kendra is fully versed in the Slayer Handbook and fighting techniques. She owns a stake called Mr. Pointy. Her appearance is the first time the Watchers' Council has been shown to identify potential Slayers (\"What's My Line, Part One\").</p> <p>In her first year as the Slayer, Zabuto sends Kendra to Sunnydale after signs indicate that a very dark power is about to rise there. Kendra sees Angel kissing Buffy with his vampire face, and assumes that she too is a vampire. Kendra imprisons Angel in a cage to kill him by sunrise and surprises Buffy as she wakes up from a night on Angel's bed. After a physical confrontation, they learn that they are both Slayers (at the time, Spike and Drusilla had hired an organization of assassins to kill Buffy; it was thus intended to be a surprise when both Buffy and the viewer discover she is not an assassin). Rupert Giles tells them that two Slayers existing at the same time is unprecedented.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Angel is taken unconscious by Willy the Snitch and sold to Spike and Drusilla. Severely weakened by sunlight, he as Drusilla's sire is to be used to return her to health. The Scooby Gang arrive to free Angel, and Kendra returns to her home country with a keepsake from Buffy.</p> <p>Kendra returns in 1998 when her Watcher informs her that Acathla will open its mouth and suck the world into hell. Zabuto gave Kendra a sword, which Kendra passes on to Buffy after surprising her as she patrols. Kendra helps the Scooby Gang protect Willow Rosenberg while she performs the Ritual of Restoration. Drusilla and her vampire lackeys arrive in the library to stop the attempt to restore Angel's soul and after a brief fight, Drusilla hypnotizes Kendra and slits her throat, killing her (\"see Becoming, Part One\"). Following Kendra's death, Faith is called as a Slayer in Boston.</p> <h2>Powers</h2><p>Kendra possessed the normal powers that come with being a slayer. She had inhanced reflexes, agility, speed, strength, and was a formidable hand to hand combatant. She has stated that she is a master of hand to hand weapons as well. Also worth noting, is that Kendra was a strictly traditional slayer, taking orders from her watcher and never straying from them. Kendra was also considerably less powerful (or skilled) than the Slayer, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20096\" href=\"/buffy/4005-20096/\" slug=\"buffy\"> Buffy</a>. Her strict uprbringing, lack of real emotion, and \"by the book\" attitude may be the reason for this, as Buffy once stated that she's good, but doesn't have enough \"passion\" to ever really beat her.</p>",

    "deck": "Originally conceived by Frank Thomas, the Owl, like Batman, was a creature of the night. When not in costume, the Owl is a police special investigator.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Nick Terry was a <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> private detective, engaged to <a href=\"/owl-girl/4005-46597/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46597\">Belle Wayne</a>, star reporter for the New York Eagle. To Nick Terry, keeping the town safe meant that he must sometimes operate outside the law. Thus, when his police tactics fail, at midnight Nick heads for his hideout on the top of a mountain and becomes the Owl.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Owl was created in 1940 by <a href=\"/frank-thomas/4040-43613/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43613\">Frank Thomas</a>. He had his last issue in the 40s in <a href=\"/popular-comics-85/4000-157127/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-157127\">Popular Comics #85</a> (March 1943). He was briefly resurrected in 1967 as part of Western Publishing's <a href=\"/gold-key/4010-178/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-178\">Gold Key</a> line. In the 90s, The Owl was used by <a href=\"/ac-comics/4010-335/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-335\">AC Comics</a> as part of their reuse of <a href=\"/public-domain-characters/4015-55750/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55750\">public domain characters</a>. In 2008, <a href=\"/dynamite-entertainment/4010-1859/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1859\">Dynamite Entertainment</a> used The Owl in their <a href=\"/project-superpowers/4050-20326/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20326\">Project Superpowers</a> line, where dozens of public domain characters were placed in modern times.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Apart from judo and his unique crimefighting hardware, the Owl has no extraordinary abilities. He does have:</p><ul><li>An airborne Owlmobile equipped with Owl-bombs and a black light ray which casts pitch darkness</li><li>Ultrasonically controlled robot Owlos, which work like bloodhounds when given a trail of any kind or can be used to dive-bomb and distract adversaries</li><li>The Owl's cape doubles as a parachute</li><li>An Owl-gun, which shoots a \"Ga-Ga Ray\" that makes people act like owls</li></ul><p> </p>",

She was a mutant with unraveled abilities and she used <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\" href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\"> adamantium</a> wires which were connected to her gloves as whips.. She was part of Critical Mass' Band of Baddies. The Baddies forced the mutant daughter to knock out the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\"> Spider-Man </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\"> Wolverine,</a> but they quickly recovered. The daughter than unleashed her powers, blew up the warehouse they were in, and defeated all of the Baddies. <br /><br />She was later joined in <a data-ref-id=\"4060-28478\" href=\"/femme-fatales/4060-28478/\"> Femme Fatales</a>, and she was hired by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4458\" href=\"/chameleon/4005-4458/\"> Chameleon</a> to threaten an ambassador. Spider-Man intervened and saved the ambassador, making an enemy with the Femme Fatales.

The Femme Fatales later received an invitation to join <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25690\" href=\"/superia/4005-25690/\"> Superia</a> and her organization of female criminals, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40960\" href=\"/femizons/4060-40960/\"> Femizons</a>. They accepted, and battled <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\"> Captain America</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10584\" href=\"/paladin/4005-10584/\"> Paladin</a> in the process. <br /><br />After the group disbanded, Whiplash teamed up with<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13400\" href=\"/orka/4005-13400/\">  Orka</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41331\" href=\"/shockwave/4005-41331/\"> Shockwave</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12067\" href=\"/killer-shrike/4005-12067/\"> Killer Shrike </a>in a plot to take over the retired aircraft carrier, the U.S. Intrepid, planning to use it to extort money from the city of New York, or from the US Government.

She was later seen in \"Bar With No Name\" attending the auction in which the Venom Symbiote was sold. <br /><br />Whiplash was possibly de-powered after the events of <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\" href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\"> M-Day</a>.",

One night during an experiment in order to create a cheaper and cleaner source of energy from ionized gas, she was caught in an explosion from her lab experiments. Once the smoke died down she realized that the explosion had turned her into sentient ionized hydrogen. Nearby <span><a data-ref-id=\"4005-7242\" href=\"/machine-man/4005-7242/\" slug=\"machine-man\">Machine Man</a></span> witnessed the explosion and came upon Voletta in her ionic form.

As she arrived at the <span><a data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\" href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" slug=\"baxter-building\">Baxter Building</a></span> she noticed that the <span><a data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\" href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" slug=\"thing\">Thing</a></span> and the <span><a data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\" href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" slug=\"human-torch\">Human Torch</a></span> were there and <span><a data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\" href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" slug=\"mr-fantastic\">Reed Richards</a></span> was nowhere to be found. Enraged again she attacked the two heroes and escaped again as Machine Man arrived on the scene. Ion then took to the streets and fought Machine Man. However during the battle Machine Man locked her in meat locker. The cold temperatures inside caused Ion to revert back to Voletta and she was taken into custody and put into a cryogenic chamber.<br class=\"clear-both\"/> <p><br class=\"clear-both\"/><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \"><br class=\"clear-both\"/><br class=\"clear-both\"/><br class=\"clear-both\"/>Joining the Femizons<br class=\"clear-both\"/></span></strong><br class=\"clear-both\"/>Sometime during the years that followed Ion awoke from her cryogenic chamber and made or obtained a suit which granted her the use of her powers, yet still let her stay in a humanoid form. Ion was then approached by <span><a data-ref-id=\"4005-11456\" href=\"/nightshade/4005-11456/\" slug=\"nightshade\">Doctor Nightshade</a></span> and <span><a data-ref-id=\"4005-25690\" href=\"/superia/4005-25690/\" slug=\"superia\">Superia</a></span>, who offered her the chance to join her <span><a data-ref-id=\"4060-40960\" href=\"/femizons/4060-40960/\" slug=\"femizons\">Femizons</a></span>. Ion accepted with false hopes that her two new benefactors would cure her ionic condition. While on a voyage with her other teammates <span><a data-ref-id=\"4005-25689\" href=\"/diamondback/4005-25689/\" slug=\"diamondback\">Diamondback</a></span> crashed the party.

During the battle Ion managed to caputre the Captain, but was knocked unconscious when he smacked her with his shield. Even though she was knocked unconscious she managed to escape. <br class=\"clear-both\"/><br class=\"clear-both\"/>Later Ion preformed various criminal acts and was stopped by the <span><a data-ref-id=\"4005-11840\" href=\"/whizzer/4005-11840/\" slug=\"whizzer\">Whizzer</a></span> and <span><span>Doctor Spectrum</span></span>.

She can also live as a sentient ionized hydrogen gas surrounded by an electromagnetic field. She also has the ability to fire bolts of electromagnetic energy, imbue metal objects with electromagnetic energy, and capture objects and people in her electromagnetic field. Ion also has superhuman regenerative powers. She also has the ability to fly. If Voletta is exposed to extremely cold temperatures she reverts back to her human form. Ion's electromagnetic field can also be disrupted by a powerful electric current.",

The group is sent to Hong Kong where they would ambush the Black Widow as she enters a shop to inquire information on a particular dagger. Laralie uses her rope skills to restrain Black Widow while the rest of her comrades surround the Russian beauty. The group begins to bicker and argue amongst themselves so Black Widow takes advantage of the situation and kicks Black Lotus.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Pink Pearl was a member of a circus troupe as the \"Fat Lady.\" She had plotted to overthrow the circus and hire her own performers in order to commit acts of <a href=\"/terrorism/4015-55686/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55686\">terrorism</a>. However, <a href=\"/northstar/4005-3190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3190\">Northstar</a> and <a href=\"/aurora/4005-3189/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3189\">Aurora</a> interfered with her plans and eventually defeated Pink Pearl by stabbing her in the chest with a knife. Fortunately for her, she survived due to her fatty tissue cushioning the blow.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Pink Pearl was created by <a href=\"/john-byrne/4040-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1770\">John Byrne</a> in 1985 and first appeared in <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4050-3217/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3217\">Alpha Flight</a> #22.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Versus Captain America</h3><p>She later received an invitation to join <a href=\"/superia/4005-25690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25690\">Superia</a>'s <a href=\"/femizons/4060-40960/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40960\">Femizons</a>, a group of thousands of female villains and criminals. Together with the group, Pink Pearl battled <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"/paladin/4005-10584/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10584\">Paladin</a>. During the skirmish, Pink Pearl, along with <a href=\"/titania/4005-4943/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4943\">Titania</a>, <a href=\"/frenzy/4005-2163/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2163\">Frenzy</a>, and <a href=\"/poundcakes/4005-32408/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32408\">Poundcakes</a>, threatened to tear Paladin's limbs off. This was able to distract Captain America, who was then knocked unconscious by <a href=\"/knockout/4005-28479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28479\">Knockout</a>. After Superia was defeated by Captain America, Pink Pearl abandoned the Femizons.</p><p>Pink Pearl chose to turn over a new leaf and end her career in terrorism. She opened up a male strip joint called Cloisters in <a href=\"/canada/4020-55868/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55868\">Canada</a>, which attracted the female members of <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a>. However, Pink Pearl discovered Aurora was present and wanted revenge for their first encounter, where Aurora stabbed her. The women of Alpha Flight were able to beat Pink Pearl, but were then arrested, not having known Pink Pearl was a legitimate businesswoman.</p><h3>A Council Of Masters</h3><p><a href=\"/max-fury/4005-73456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73456\">Max Fury</a>, the leader of the <a href=\"/shadow-council/4060-57698/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57698\">Shadow Council</a> has assembled a new <a href=\"/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\">Masters of Evil</a> in the sovereign nation of <a href=\"/bagalia/4020-57907/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57907\">Bagalia</a> where Pink Pearl is presently a member.

She was unable to stop him from activating his time machine and, in retaliation, the Leader ordered his intelligent computer, <a href=\"/omnivac/4005-32269/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32269\"> Omnivac</a>, to take on a humanoid form and discipline Jackdaw. A harsh disciplinarian, Omnivac nearly killed Jackdaw.</p><p>Beaten to the brink of death, Jackdaw tried to stop the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\"> Avengers</a> from being sent back in time, as that was part of the Leader's plan. Only the Hulk and <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\"> She-Hulk</a> remained in the present, as the Leader had programmed the device to be unable to be used against him. The two other gamma-powered beings shared this immunity. Hulk managed to figure the device out and the two of them went back in time and foiled the Leader's plot. Omnivac tried to prevent the Avengers from returning, but Jackdaw stopped him by ripping the wires out of his head.</p><h3>Femizons</h3><p>After leaving the Leader's employ, she changed her name to Blackbird and was one of the women recruited by <a href=\"/superia/4005-25690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25690\"> Superia</a> for the <a href=\"/femizons/4060-40960/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40960\"> Femizons</a>.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-494118\" data-img-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/494118-bb2.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"1.715953307393\" data-width=\"257\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 257px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:171.6%\" href=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/494118-bb2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494118\"><img alt=\" lieutenant of Superia's Femizons\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" data-width=\"257\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/494118-bb2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/494118-bb2.jpg 257w\"><noscript><img alt=\" lieutenant of Superia's Femizons\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/494118-bb2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/494118-bb2.jpg 257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" data-width=\"257\"></noscript></a><figcaption> lieutenant of Superia's Femizons</figcaption></figure><p>As a member of the Femizons, Blackbird was sent along with <a href=\"/moonstone/4005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\"> Moonstone</a> to stop <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\"> Captain America</a> and <a href=\"/paladin/4005-10584/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10584\"> Paladin</a>, who had come to Femizonia Island to find <a href=\"/diamondback/4005-25689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25689\"> Diamondback</a>. Blackbird managed to defeat Paladin, but he was freed by Captain America. Paladin managed to subdue Moonstone, so Blackbird fled to get reinforcements (as <a href=\"/modam/4005-25588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25588\"> Modam</a> had already been fended off as well). Captain America, however, managed to grab her and choked her until she passed out. Blackbird was subsequently released into police custody.</p><p>After either being released or managing to escape, Blackbird joined up with Superia again, serving as one of her lieutenants alongside <a href=\"/iron-maiden/4005-10968/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10968\"> Iron Maiden</a> and <a href=\"/snapdragon/4005-44971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44971\"> Snapdragon</a>. The four women attended the AIM Weapons Expo on Boca Caliente and intended to take over the island. They would then use the profits to finance Superia's plans for global conquest. Superia quickly murdered the head of AIM, but was subdued by MODAM, who chose to remain loyal to AIM, refusing to help Superia. Notably, the head of AIM was revealed to be an adaptoid, and he recovered from Superia's attack. He then directed MODAM to dispose of Superia.</p><p>Blackbird and Iron Maiden immediately went to help Superia. Snapdragon, however, was confronted by Diamondback who sought vengeance her near drowning on the S.S. Superia. Diamondback killed Snapdragon, and MODAM blasted Blackbird into submission. Iron Maiden was unable to stop MODAM as she left with Superia in tow.</p><p>What has become of Blackbird in recent years remains unknown.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers/Abilities</h2><p>Blackbird has no innate powers, but she possesses an armored winged suit that enables her to fly at great speeds. She has technological expertise and is skilled with a variety of weapons. One of her signature weapons is a cable claw which can ensnare and bind her foes. This cable is exceptionally strong and can hold humans with enhanced strength.</p><p> </p><h2>Statistics</h2><p><strong>Known Relatives:</strong>Unrelieved</p><p><strong>Citizenship:</strong> Citizen of the United States, with a considerable sized criminal record.</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Unrevealed</p><p><strong>Base of Operations:</strong> Mobile</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> Unrevealed</p><p><strong>Group Affiliation:</strong> Former of the Leader, former lieutenant of Superia's Femizons</p><p><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</p><p><strong>Weight: </strong>130 lbs</p><p><strong>Height: </strong>5'7\"</p><p><strong>Eyes: </strong>Blue-green</p><p><strong>Hair:</strong> Unknown</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "deck": "Wendell Rand was the ward of Orson Randall learning how to fight at his side. After their falling out he went to K'un-Lun and earned the right to become the Iron Fist. Instead of facing Shou-Lao, he returned to Earth and fathered Danny Rand, the current Iron Fist.",
    "description": "<p>The Iron Fist named Orson Randall first met a young orphaned boy named Wendell in a bar somewhere in Nepal. How Wendell came to be there is unknown but he ended up saving Orson's life who then took the boy in as his ward. He raised Wendell like a son teaching him how to fight and telling him stories of K'un-Lun where he had grown up. Along with their allies; the Confederates of the Curious, they traveled the world finding adventure using Orson's father's money and technology. Wendell wanted to be the next Iron Fist like his mentor but Orson got angry whenever Wendell mentioned it and told him Shou-Lao would kill him if he ever tried. After Wendell was shot on a mission Orson left him beind so Wendell decided to find K'un-Lun and become the Iron Fist to spite his former mentor.</p><p>Finding his way to the K'un-Lun mountains in Tibet where legend said the mystical city appears Wendell saw two men being attacked by a dragon. Firing his rifle at the dragon it retreated and Wendell ended up saving the lives of Tu-An Lord of K'un-Lun called Yu-Ti, the August Personage in Jade and his son Nu-An. Yu-Ti adopted young Wendell and apprenticed him to Lei Kung the Thunderer who immediately recognized who had trained the boy. Since everyone in K'un-Lun believed Orson to be dead Wendell became known as Wendell Rand-K'ai. Training in Lei Kung's temple Wendell's greatest sparring partner and closest friend was Davos the son of Lei Kung their sensai. Eventually it came down to Davos and Wendell for the honor of becoming the Iron Fist and they would have to fight each other before the winner would face Shou-Lao.</p><p>During their ritualistic combat Wendell gained the upper hand but Davos refused to yield preferring to die rather than quit. Yu-Ti had to step in and declare Wendell the winner before Wendell was forced to kill Davos. In Davos' mind he hadn't yielded therefore he hadn't lost. Believing that Yu-Ti and his own father preferred the outworlder and had conspired against Davos decided to face Shou-Lao that night. The dragon brutalized Davos but before it struck the killing blow it turned away leaving him near death and completely dishonored. When it was Wendell's turn to face the dragon he couldn't get the image of Davos broken body and Orson's words out of his mind. Instead of facing the dragon Wendell turned away and went to Davos telling that he couldn't face the dragon after seeing what it did to him. The injured Davos laughed at his former friend calling him a coward so Wendell fled K'un-Lun to Earth to kill Orson for spoiling his dreams.</p><p>Tracking Orson down Wendell was ready to fight and even kill his mentor but when he found him in a drug induced haze Wendell's anger completely dissolved. Orson realized that the mantle of the Iron Fist wasn't a gift, it was a curse of violence and death and he wanted better for Wendell. It wasn't that Orson wanted Wendell to fail he just knew it wasn't his destiny, but his destiny would be to father a great Iron Fist. After the death of his first wife <a href=\"../../shakari/29-80372/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shakari</a> and with Orson pretending to be dead and Wendell as his sole beneficiary he shortened his name to Rand and moved to New York City to pursue his destiny. In New York Wendell found a partner, Harold Meachum, and built Rand-Meachum Inc and found a wife Heather Duncan and fathered a son they named Danny. After ten years Wendell planned to bring Heather and Danny to K'un-Lun and Harold Meachum insisted on accompanying them.</p><p>No path to or from K'un-Lun stays the same same so Wendell couldn't find the paths he had used when he first found the city or the one he used to leave. While crossing a crevasse Danny slipped pulling his mother with him onto a ledge and his father fell the opposite way holding the rope and was left dangling over a shear drop. Instead of saving his business partner Meachum cut the safety rope letting Wendell fall so he could take over the whole company himself. Heather and Danny ran from Meachum to find their own way down the mountain but were soon found by a pack of hungry wolves. Nu-An who had always sought power became Yu-Ti after his father's death and witnessed his adopted brother's death through a magic scrying crystal.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3> </h3><h3>TV</h3><h3> </h3><h4><em>Iron Fist (2017) </em></h4><p>Wendell Rand is the deceased father of Danny Rand.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Chance is a test pilot for the U.S. Navy. One day, while investigating a fast bright light underneath the ocean, he fired a torpedo at it, but unfortunately, the <a href=\"/blue/4060-41253/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41253\"> Blue </a>that he was chasing dissolved and the torpedo hit a top secret facility called <a href=\"/deep-marine-discovery/4020-55981/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55981\"> DMD</a> (Deep Marine Discovery). Aspen was apart of the DMD team and nearly drowned due to his mistake. Chance was horrified when he saw all the dead bodies that he caused and eventually found <a href=\"/aspen-matthews/4005-41245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41245\">Aspen Matthews</a>, with her newly activated powers. Chance later meets up with Aspen at her San Diego home to explain to her about what he saw. Aspen allowed him to stay with her for a while, but after his brother arrived the next day to retrieve Chance for the Navy, he became angry and started drinking. Later that night, he meets up with <a href=\"/cannon-hawke/4005-41254/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41254\"> Cannon</a>, while still under the influence, and would later help Cannon save Aspen. During the confrontation against <a href=\"/killian/4005-41255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41255\"> Killian</a>, Chance used Cannon's ship to help distract the majority of Killian's army. After he aided Aspen and Cannon during the Blue Sun, he went into hiding because he was U.A. (Unauthorized Absence). Eventually, <a href=\"/james-maylander/4005-46345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46345\"> Admiral Maylander</a> would call him back without any questions to train new pilots. Aspen meets up with Chance again after she escapes from the Blacks. He helps Aspen look for her father, <a href=\"/captain-matthews/4005-46681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46681\"> Captain Matthews</a>. Aspen eventually begins to grow feelings for each other, and they have their first kiss right before she went off to help the Blues fight the humans When Aspen went to help the Blues defend against the humans, Chance and Captain Matthews went to <a href=\"/mexico/4020-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55820\"> Mexico </a>to wait until Aspen returned.</p>",

    "deck": "Samus Aran is the heroine of the Metroid universe and is an intergalactic bounty hunter. Samus also happens to be the first playable female video game character.",
    "description": "<p>Samus Aran was born on the planet K2-L. She was the daughter of Virginia and Rodney Aran. Her family ran the local mining operation of Afloradite. When she as three years old, a Chozo (a bird like race of creatures with incredible intelligence) came to the mine to ask for Afloradite. Samus met the old bird, and the two became close friends, despite Samus being only three years old. She affectionately came to name him \"Bird Granpa\". Unfortunately, the Chozo were turned down because of regulations, and left the planet. A day later, a fleet of Space Pirates-a sinister criminal organization in the galaxy-caught a scan of the leaving Chozo ship, and discovered the Afloradite mine. Afloradite was a unstable mineral, but was an incredible source of fuel and explosives. Immediately the planet was raided, and in the process, Samus's mother was killed. Unwilling to die by the Pirate's hands and sacrifice the Afloradite, Samus's father intentionally detonated the whole payload, which killed many of the Space Pirates, save for their leader, the dragon-like <a href=\"/ridley/4005-55799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55799\">Ridley</a>.</p><p>A few hours later, the same Chozo detected the explosion and came to investigate, finding the young Samus as the only survivor.</p><h2>The Hatchling</h2><p>After the raid of K2-L, the Chozo returned Samus to their own planet, Zebes. It was uninhabitable by humans, and Samus could only survive a few days in her current condition. Bird Granpa, becoming emotionally attached to Samus, did the only thing he could. She was put into an incubator and infused with the blood of the Chozo, giving her abilities far above any human, and enabling her to survive on the harsh conditions of Zebes. For eleven years she lived with the Chozo uneventfully, training to be a soldier. As a gift to her, the Chozo gave Samus her most efficient weapon: the Power Suit.</p><p>It was a suit of incredibly efficient armor that increased her power and granted her extraordinary abilities. She trained long and hard with the Power Suit, trying to become proficient with it, with slow gradual success. After a particularly frustrating day of training, Samus stumbled upon a group of flowers. Thinking them as beautiful things, she gathered them and began showing them to the Chozo. It was immediately realized by Bird Grandpa that they were the poison species of flower that grew on the planet called \"The Bajar Glove\". They were incinerated by Chozo defense robots, but the poison had spread to some local species of giant butterfly. The insects grew hostile, and began to attack anything in sight. Fearing that the Chozo's A.I. advisor, Mother Brain, would order the butterflies exterminated, she fended them off in her first showing of skill with the Power Suit. After calming from the effects of the toxin in the flower, Mother Brain still ordered the butterflies to be incinerated, to Samus's horror. After her showing of skill with the situation, it was then that Bird Granpa knew that Samus had the skills to leave Zebes. He sent her off-to her dismay- stating that she was ready to protect the universe. She traveled the universe, taking on small jobs, but also applied to the Galactic Federation, and received extra years of combat training from them (The Galactic Federation is the government of the Metroid Universe). She worked under a C.O. named Adam Malkovitch for a time, until a event caused her to leave the job and become a permanent bounty hunter.</p><p>After her leave of Zebes, something disastrous occurred. The Space Pirates assaulted the planet full-scale, and exterminated the peaceful Chozo. Samus would not be aware of this event for some time, however, as she did not contact her adopted family.</p><h2>Zero Mission</h2><p>Years passed with Samus doing simple tasks for various customers. However, she was contacted by the Galactic Federation once again. It seemed the Space Pirates were back, and had begun a vicious campaign of destruction across the universe. Their main weapon was the Metroid, a creature capable of draining the life-force from living creatures. With thousands in their possession, the Space Pirates posed a serious threat to the galaxy, and could annihilate entire planets. Immediately accepting the job, Samus headed back to her home planet and the new base of the Space Pirates: Planet Zebes. After destroying the Chozo, the Space Pirates made one of their main bases in a section of Zebes called Tourian. Once landing, Samus searches the planet, discovers the base, and hunts down the Space Pirate forces. She kills one of the generals of the criminals, the massive Kraid, and eventually finds Ridley, extracting vengeance upon him also. Gradually working her way down into Tourian, she rampages through the base, destroying Metroids and Space Pirate forces, until finding the true mastermind behind the organization-Mother Brain, the former Chozo A.I. Essentially helpless to attacks, Samus easily destroys the being. However, upon her destruction, Mother Brain activates the self-destruct mechanism of the base, leaving Samus moments to escape. As Samus was flying off-world in her ship, however, she took anti-air fire from the Space Pirate space craft, and crashes. She survived, but her suit was damaged beyond repair. Samus left the armor behind and then left to infiltrate the mother ship in her Zero-Suit.</p><p>Sneaking through the mother ship and past its forces, she found an old Chozo temple. Inside, she was attacked by a glowing orb of energy, but destroyed it. The burst of energy that followed reconstructed the Power Suit. It was a fail safe devised by the Chozo should Samus ever need a replacement. Going on a rampage through the mothership, Samus damaged much of it and destroyed a large amount of Pirate forces. However, one more foe blocked her path-a robotic version of Ridley, much more powerful than the actual creature. After a battle, Samus destroyed the robot, but once again, a self-destruct device was activated and she was only given moments to escape. After hijacking a Pirate fightership, she finally managed to escape the planet, and the \"Zero Mission\" was complete.</p><h2>Metroid Prime</h2><p>Cruising the galaxy, Samus picked up a signal and discovered a seemingly abandoned Pirate frigate called the Orpheon. Upon further investigation, she discovered that the frigate had been badly damaged from the inside. By scanning the Pirate data left in the consoles, she found out that the Pirates have been experimenting on creatures with a dangerous chemical called Phazon. By giving the captured life-forms on board freakish strength and abilities, they had rampaged through the frigate and killed almost all Pirates on board. Delving deeper into the facility, Samus was then attacked by a large creature, a mutated Parasite Queen. After mortally wounding the creature, it falls into the frigates power reactor, causing it to spin wildly off axis and begin exploding. During her escape, she discovered that the Pirate had been rebuilding Ridley with cybernetics. The monster awoke, and flew out of the frigate. Samus also escaped, but her suit was badly damaged during the frigates explosion, and she lost some of it's abilities. Following Ridley onto the nearby planet of Tallon IV, she discovered that the Pirates has been rebuilding their forces in a new base. She also found out that Tallon had once been inhabited by the Chozo-but they had been wiped out by a Phazon meteor which corrupted much of the planet. She took cleaning this up as her responsibility, and so, headed out to destroy the Pirates once more. She explored the planet long, and exterminated many hostile creatures that had been infected with Phazon. She regained her lost abilities, and also earned the Gravity Suit and the Phazon Suit (the latter after a particularly hazardous battle with a giant Space Pirate). After obtaining Space Pirate data, she read that a Metroid had been mutated into something extremely powerful and threatening-the Metroid Prime. It's home lay in the Impact Crater of the Phazon Meteorite. Deciding that she had to exterminate the creature, she collected 12 Chozo artifacts that would open a secret doorway to the Crater. Upon collection and gathering of the twelve in the designated area, she was attacked by Ridley. Burning off his wings, she wounded him badly, but the final blow was struck by the 12 Chozo statues, which used a defense system to knock Ridley off of a cliff. The passageway was open, and Samus entered the Impact Crater, a hellish place poison, fire, and danger. She made her way to the center, and confronted the Metroid Prime. After a initial battle, she knocked the beast down a tunnel, and into the core of the planet. She followed it, and found that the creature had abandoned it's outer casing, revealing it's true form. Unable to do normal damage to the Metroid, she used her Phazon Suit to channel the pools of Phazon into her arm-cannon, and finally defeated the monster. As it's sole inhabitant lay dieing, the Impact Crater began to collapse. She began to leave the crater, but the Metroid grabbed a hold of her, and stole the Phazon essence out of her suit-effectively taking away the Phazon Suit. Nevertheless, Samus escaped the deadly environment, and flew off planet.</p><h2>Aether</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175122-12357.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175122\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175122-12357.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175122\"><img alt=\"The Ultimate Parasite - Metroid Prime\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175122-12357.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175122-12357.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>The Ultimate Parasite - Metroid Prime</figcaption></figure><p>Weeks later, Samus received a distress call from Planet Aether. Flying through the planets unstable atmosphere, a lightning bolt hit her ship, forcing her to land for repairs. It was here where she learns the origin of the distress call-a Galactic Federation transport ship. It crashed in the same manner as her's had. Unlike her, all of the crew was dead, killed by some unknown source. She checked the ships log files, and watched a video-tape of the crew's last moments. Hundreds of creatures had attacked the crew, and killed them all. She investigated, and discovers that the planet was really two planets. Another Phazon meteor collided with Aether, and the disturbance split the planet into two planets inhabiting the same space, but in different dimensions-one being natural, and the other being composed of darkness. She then found the one true indigenous species of Aether: The Luminoth. Only one remained awake, the rest remaining in cryo-stasis. U-Mos was the sentinel of the Luminoth, the only awake Luminoth. For long, the Luminoth had waged a war with the inhabitants of the dark side of Aether, a race of vicious creatures called the Ing. The beasts could possess other creatures, and use them for their own bidding. Samus first realizes this when she entered Dark Aether, for the Ing possess the bodies of Space Pirates. However, as she explored the dimension, she was ambushed by a doppelganger of herself, which destroys the only thing protecting Samus from the Ing and the hazardous environment-a bubble of light created by a crystal. A horde of Ing attacked her, and through the combined damage she lost most of her abilities. She barely escaped Dark Aether, but returned later, as the way to destroy Dark Aether and return the planet to it's original state was to steal the gathered energy from the planet and return to it the light side. Once it was all gathered, Dark Aether would collapse on itself. She then journeyed throughout Dark Aether, collected all of the energy, and returned it to Aether. However, she would have to travel to one more place-the Hive of the Ing. She entered it, defeated the Emperor Ing, and was escaping the crumbling dimension as Dark Samus returned for a final attack. With seconds left, the two foes engaged in a duel. Before it ended, Samus would realize that her clone was really the Metroid Prime reborn from the fragments of her Phazon Suit. After defeating Dark Samus, she escaped as the dimension collapsed, and was greeted by the grateful Luminoth. Waving off their thanks, she flew off the planet.</p><h2>Metroid Prime Hunters</h2><p>A group of special units within the Galactic Federation who had long range telepathy received a telepathic message stating that the key to the ultimate weapon in the universe was located in the Alimbic circle of planets. However, several other organizations also became aware of this, and hired mercenaries to find it for them. The Galactic Federation, seeing the competition, turned to Samus for assistance, deploying her to find this weapon. When Samus arrived at this complex system, she found that this civilization was destroyed, and Samus started to investigate 2 planets that were orbiting the Sun of Alimbic.</p><p>The society of Alimbic was very spiritual, but one day a meteor fell into the planet, and inside there was a terrible creature named Gorea by the inhabitants of the Alimbics. Gorea took the cellular structure of the Society, and mimicked the Alimbic weapons and then destroyed the society.</p><p>The last act of the civilization was to try and trap Gorea, so the danger would be put to rest. All the Alimbics fused themselves together into telepathic energy, and created Gorea a \"Seal Sphere\" and sent it into a starship named \"Oubliette\", which was flown into the center of the Infinity Void, a dimensional rift.. The Oublitte would launch out if the Infinity Void was closed down, only when eight artifacts called \"Octoliths\" were assembled. Samus traversed the planets, engaged in the other bounty hunters, and gathered the eight Octoliths to open the Infinity Void, with the other hunters in hot pursuit.. However, unaware of the history of the Void they were unprepared for Gorea, and thus were all defeated, and their power was drained. Samus, alone, used a conjunction of her gathered weapons to turn the monster into it's true form, which prompted the recreation of the Omega Cannon, an ancient weapon belonging to the Alimbics. Fighting Gorea with the cannon, Samus manages to free the other hunter's from the beast's grasp and eventually destroy it. It would appear that the original psychic signal sent out was from Gorea itself, manipulating the events so it would be freed from it's prison in the starship. As the hunters go their separate ways, three spirits of the Alimbics come and thanks Samus with a salute.</p><p>The other hunters involved in this event were....</p><ul><li>Sylux: Sylux is much like Samus (from methods to weapons), but has a deep hate for the Galactic Federation. Oddly, his suit, weapons, and ship were all stolen from the government. His Alt-form is the Lockjaw, a small craft that, like Samus, can drop bombs. However, if three bombs are arranged in a circle, it creates a field of high-voltage electricity. His special weapon is the Shock Coil, which is an electric weapon that drains the energy of his enemies, and transfers it to himself.</li></ul><ul><li>Kanden: Kanden is a Federation bio-experiment gone insane. He investigates the Alimbrics to have the ultimate power and prove to the Federation that he is the ultimate life-form. Kanden can morph into the Stinglarva, a robotic worm that releases his tail to create explosions. Kanden prefers a rare electric weapon-the Volt Drive, which distorts his enemy's vision.</li></ul><ul><li>Weavel: Weavel was a pirate general, whom Samus almost killed on Brinstar. He was repaired and upgraded by the other Pirates, and in doing so, gave him many robotic systems that he needed to live, which made his into a advanced cyborg. The only organics in Weavel's body is his brain and spinal cord. Weavel's Alt-form is the Half Turret. This Alt-form is very unique, as he splits into two separate parts. One is a turret that shoots his enemies-this half is his legs, transformed-and the other half has him moving quickly using his arms, and slashing his enemies with a energy sabre connected to one of them. This Alt-form makes him very vulnerable, as he is in two weaker sections. His special weapon is the Battle Hammer which is a fast shooting energy weapon, much like the Power Beam. It is very popular among Space Pirates.</li></ul><ul><li>Noxus: A rare Vhozan that is a \"law enforcer\" hunter. He wanted the Alimbics power to keep in a safe place. His Alt-form is Vhoscythe, a top with a blade that extends to damage enemies. He prefers the Judicater weapon. This weapon is like the Ice Beam that Samus uses, but the Judicator fires missiles which bounce everywhere, and when fully charged the Judicator freezes anything it touches.</li></ul><ul><li>Trace: Trace is from the Kriken empire, a race of malicious insect-like warriors. He is actually searching for planets that the Empire can invade, which would make him ruler of said planet. His Alt-Form is the Triskelion, a large insect that slashes with claws. If Trace stays still for long enough, he will turn invisible-a natural defense mechanism of the Krikens. Trace is-and his species-are hated throughout the universe for their twisted conquests.</li></ul><h2>Corruption</h2><p>Approximately six months after the incident on Planet Aether, Samus was contacted again by the Federation. She boarded the G.F.S. Olympus, and met Admiral Dane, the commander of the Federation fleet. Samus also met three other hunters, Hunter Ghor (who has the ability to control and join with machines), Hunter Rundas (who has the ability to generate and control ice), and Hunter Ghandrayda (who has the ability to shape-shift). Dane hired them all to solve a massive problem concerning the Federation. For twenty years, the G.F. had been using organic supercomputers known as \"Aurora Units\" to co-ordinate and serve the G.F. But, mysteriously, a virus spread among the AU's, which numbered in the thousands. The G.F. cut off the infected AU's from the rest, essentially crippling the entire Federation from maintaining important contact. In the process, a training ship, the G.F.S. Valhalla, was attacked and presumably destroyed. The Admirable hired the four Hunters to go to the infected AU's and purge them of the virus. Without the system online, the Federation was in serious danger of Pirate attacks. Samus and the other Hunter then meet the Olympus's AU, AU 242. As the briefing ends, a red alert signals throughout the fleet, warning the soldiers of a impending Pirate attack.. The planet the fleet had been orbiting was Norion, which was the main center for the Federation Navy. If it was destroyed, then the universe was helpless from attack. Sensing this, Dane orders the four hunters to touchdown on Norion and defend the planet from attack. Samus makes her way down the flagship, but is attacked several times by Pirate boarding parties. Eventually, she passes through the hazards and reaches the docking bay, when-out of nowhere-Samus is attacked by a Berserker Lord, a Pirate trooper mutated to giant size through Phazon. Samus defeated it, and knocked the Berserker Lord out of the docking bay and into space, where it collides with a Pirate fighter. Unhindered, Samus flew down to Norion. Upon her landing, she learns that a giant bioform, a \"Leviathan Seed\" has appeared approaching the planet on a direct collision course. If it were to collide, untold destruction would spread across the planet. Samus and the other hunters are tasked with with getting the three main generators online and reactivating the Orbital Defense Cannon. With assistance from Gandrayda, Samus activates one generator. While moving to activate the next, Samus is attacked by several Pirate carriers and troopers. As she begins to become outnumbered, Rundas appears and destroys several. The two went their separate ways to activate the last generators. Just as she is about to get hers online, Ridley flies down and tackles her down into the gaping chasm underneath the generator. Samus and Ridley engage in a fierce battle while plummeting down the 2000 meter long pit. Getting the upper hand, Samus pries open Ridleys mouth and fires a blast into it, knocking the dragon out. Rundas-using one of his ice slides-goes down the pit and grabs Samus, taking her back up to the top, and leaves her to activate the generator. After the generator was online, the four hunters converge to the Control Tower to activate the Cannon. Arriving at the top, the group is surprised attacked by a revived Dark Samus. After a short skirmish, Dark Samus defeats the hunters with a large Phazon beam, and departs. Gandrayda, Ghor, and Rundas are all down, but a severely wounded Samus manages to activate the cannon before slipping into unconsciousness. The cannon successfully fires, and destroys the giant Leviathan Seed before it can collide with the planet.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/308568-56176.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-308568\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.0620689655172\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 290px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:206.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/308568-56176.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-308568\"><img alt=\"Hypercharged - The PED Suit\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/308568-56176.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/308568-56176.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></a><figcaption>Hypercharged - The PED Suit</figcaption></figure><p>Samus awakes a month later on the Olympus. It is revealed to her by a Federation scientist that her body has been self-generating Phazon-a side effect of the beam from Dark Samus. It is also revealed that the Federation outfitted Samus's armor with a PED, a Phazon Enhancement Device (which Samus had seen Federation Troopers using earlier on Norion, to outstanding effect), which allows Samus to temporarily enter \"Hypermode\", a powerful state where Samus is invincible and deals destructive Phazon weaponry. The other Hunters had awoken two weeks earlier, and were sent on their missions to destroy Levianthan Seeds that had collided with other planets. Contact with all the Hunters ceased seven days earlier. Samus is then sent to accomplish the tasks that the other Hunters seemingly failed. She first went to planet Bryyo, a primeval planet once inhabited by a genius race. However, all that remains of the society are ruins. She discovers that the Leviathan Seed on the planet has a energy shield guarding it-she cannot destroy the Seed while the shield is online. Samus deactivates one of the shield generators, but while deactivating the other, she is attacked by Pirates. While fending them off, Rundas appears and quickly dispatches the remaining forces. He was not in his right mind, though, and attacks Samus, who defeats him. He is then killed by his own ice-powers going wild, as three icicles impale him. Suddenly materializing, Dark Samus absorbed the defeated hunter, despite the best efforts of Samus. The apparition disappears, and Samus deactivates the shield generators. She also destroys the anti-air turrets guarding the other shield generators, and bombs them with her ship. With the Seed vulnerable, Samus enters it. Making her way deeper in, she finds the core of the Seed, and it's keeper, the giant golem Mogenar. Samus defeats it, and destroys the core by overloading it with Phazon, but in the process has even more phazon enter her body. She flies away from Bryyo as the Seed explodes.</p><p>The next planet that has a Seed on it is planet Eysia. Skytown, a giant, deserted research station in the sky, in the closest area to the Seed, and Samus touches down there. She soon finds another Aurora Unit in the installation. Samus purges the AU of the Phazon Virus, and reactivates it. It is still cut off from the main system, so Samus enters its processing area to connect it. She is suddenly attacked by Ghor-also seemingly mad-and in the ensuing short fight, the mechanics that allow the AU to connect to the system are damaged. Ghor retreats. The only thing that could repair the AU would be Ghor's Nova Cannon. Samus sets off the hunt him down, but does not need to search far as she receives a distress call from her ship. Returning, Samus finds Ghor, back into his mech. After a battle, Ghor is defeated.. Again, Dark Samus appears to absorb the Hunter, and Samus tries to-in vain-stop her. Samus retrieved Ghor's Nova Cannon, and returned to the AU. She then repairs it and connects it to the system. The AU advises Samus on how to destroy the shield to the Seed, as the shield generator is inaccessable. Samus must assemble a Theronian Bomb, a weapon capable of destroying the Seed. Samus gathers the necessary parts and assembles them. Transporting the bomb over the Seed, she is attacked by Pirates, whom she fends off. Dropping the bomb, Samus escapes as a massive explosion destroys the shield guarding the Leviathan seed. Samus, once again, enters the Seed, makes her way to the core and battles it's guardian, the robotic Helios. She defeats the guardian, destroys the core, and escapes, flying off of planet Elysia. Again, her body is more corrupted by the Phazon.</p><p>While floating above Elysia, Samus receives a transmission from Aurora Unit 242. The ruins of the training ship Valhalla had been found. She is also informed that the Federation is preparing for an attack on the Pirate Home world. Landing on the Home world, Samus is stopped from advancing by a perpetual fall of acid rain. However, she receives a transmission from a G.F. Trooper, captured during the attack on Norion. He had escaped confinement, and had vital information on how to bypass the acid rain. Meeting the trooper, Samus defends him from Pirates. However, the soldier was really Gandrayda, who had been planning a sneak attack. The two have a battle, where Gandrayda mimics Berserker Lords, Ghor, Rundas, and Samus herself, but she is defeated and subsequently absorbed by Dark Samus. Samus then flies off world back to Elysia, and retrieves the Spider-Ball, which will allow her to enter the Hazard Shield building area. Retrieving the hazard shield back on the Home world, she traverses through the acid rain. Contacted again by Admiral Dane, Samus is instructed to deactivate the planet's orbital shield which will allow the Federation ships to attack. Successfully disabled, the Federation launches a full-assault on the planet. Samus protects G.F. Demolition Troopers, as they are the only ones with the necessary explosives to bypass several Pirate areas. After a prolonged battle, the way to the Seed is blown clear. Entering the bioform, she meets the Homeworlds guardian, a new and Phazon enhanced Ridley. She destroys the dragon, in a apparent final duel. Overloading the core, she successfully destroys the Seed, and is then even more corrupted, a full 75% of her body infected by the poisonous Phazon. The AU from Elysia then discovers-by figuring out the trajectory and speed of the Seeds-where the Leviathans came from. A planet, composed almost entirely of Phazon, had been spawning the Seeds. The Federation discovered that the only way for the Leviathans to move such a far distance away would be to open a wormhole, and it is deduced that the Leviathans have this ability. One is found orbiting the Pirate Homeworld, but the Federation have no way to control it and attack the Phazon planet, named Phaaze by AU 242. Samus investigates the Valhalla, and not only finds the command codes to control the Leviathan, but finds that the AU for the Valhalla had mysteriously disappeared. Nevertheless, Samus uses a warp on the Homeworld to board the Leviathan, and orders it open a wormhole to Phaaze. It does, and the entire Federation fleet goes through and launches a full-scale attack on the planet, where Dark Samus (who had been in control of the Pirates this entire time by Corrupting them. It was also discovered that she had Corrupted the other Hunters with the Phazon inside of them, taking control and attacking Samus with them) and the main Pirate Force are stationed. A massive battle occurs in orbit of Phaaze, and Samus slips by and lands on the planet. As soon as her feet touch the surface, she is overloaded by massive amounts of Phazon. The only way for her to survive was to vent all of her Energy Tanks, putting her in permanent Hyper mode. As long as she did not have too much more Phazon enter her body, she would survive. She makes her way down the Sentient planet, and drops down several long tunnel/pits to reach the core, where she destroys a infant Leviathan while battling Phazon Metroids (also noted is, inside crevices in the walls are husks of many Metroid Primes). After the infant is destroyed, a final, massive tunnel appears in the ground, and Samus jumps down. Slamming into the bottom, Samus encounters Dark Samus, and the two opposite beings dual for one last time.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/184737-20698-samus-aran.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-184737\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6806451612903\" data-width=\"310\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:168.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/184737-20698-samus-aran.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-184737\"><img alt=\"The mad doppelganger - Dark Samus\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" data-width=\"310\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/184737-20698-samus-aran.JPG\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/184737-20698-samus-aran.JPG 310w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The mad doppelganger - Dark Samus\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/184737-20698-samus-aran.JPG\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/184737-20698-samus-aran.JPG 310w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" data-width=\"310\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The mad doppelganger - Dark Samus</figcaption></figure><p>Samus repels the creature, but just then, the stolen Aurora Unit from the Valhalla emerges out of the core of the very planet, corrupted by Phazon. Dark Samus merges with it, and attacks Samus. Prying open it's weak spot, Samus blows apart the joints connecting the AU to the core. Then, after a final long and blistering battle, Samus destroys the AU. Dark Samus reemerges, and explodes is a final shower of Phazon by Samus, ending the menace of the Doppelganger once and for all. Samus appears to be finished, but the Phazon is purged from her body. The Pirate Fleet battling the Federation all self-destruct as the control established by Dark Samus fails. Opening a wormhole, the Fleet manages to escape just as the Planet explodes, with the last Leviathan Seed destroyed in the blast.</p><p>The Federation fleet suffered 37% casualties, but for the most part, survived. No contact between Samus and the rest of the Fleet had been established. It is assumed that Samus died in the explosion. But, finally, Samus flies by the G.F.S. Olympus, and sends one message to the Flagship.</p><p>Mission Complete.</p><p>With a thumbs up and a salute passing between Samus and Admiable Dane, Samus flies off. She lands on Elysia, and thinks back to the three Hunters that she served beside. Removing her suit, she enters her ship, and speeds off in hyper-drive. Seconds after Samus's ship disappears, one emerges in orbit around Elysia. it is none other than Sylux. He takes off after her....</p><h2>Genocide</h2><p>Not wanting to repeat the incident with the Space Pirates, the Galactic Federation sent several strike teams to the Metroid home world of SR-388 to destroy the Metroids. None of them returned. Eventually realizing that only one person could fully do this task, the Federation contacts Samus again, and commands her to go to SR-388 and annihilate the entire Metroid species. Samus accepts the job, lands on the planet, and works her way down the maze that is SR-388. She observes that the Metroids evolve during their lifetime, from the small jelly-fish creature to massive, lizard-like Omega Metroids. She defeats all of the Metroids save for one: the Queen. Engaging in a battle with it, Samus destroys the Queen, ending the threat of the Metroids. However, with the Queens destruction, the volcano that is the nest of the Metroids begins to erupt, and Samus runs to her ship. On the way, she finds one last Metroid egg. As she prepares to destroy it, it hatches, and imprints on her, as it thinks it is it’s mother. With one moment of humanity in this mission of genocide, Samus spares it’s life, and escapes with it. Flying off the planet, Samus realizes the massive scientific opportunities that the Metroid possesses, and hands it over to the Ceres Space colony for examination.</p><h2>Return to Zebes</h2><p>A few hours after dropping off the Metroid with the scientists, Samus received a distress call from the Ceres Space Colony. Flying back to the colony, Samus finds it in ruins and the scientists slaughtered. Suddenly, Ridley flies by and away, holding the Metroid hatchling. He had activated the self-destruct system, leaving Samus with only a few seconds the scape. The colony explodes behind her, and Samus chases after Ridley, tracking him down to Zebes. She finds that the base she destroyed in her first trip to the planet has been rebuilt. She goes through every area, and destroys each general, including a rebuilt Kraid and Ridley. Working her way down Tourian, the core of the base, Samus finds several genetically engineered Metroids. She destroys them all. About to enter the final area, she is attacked by a massive Metroid. It drains her power away, and flies off. Samus realizes that the Metroid was really the Hatchling, and it had been growing to a giant size. Recovering, Samus enters the final area, and finds a rebuilt Mother Brain. She destroys it, and is about to leave when it attaches itself to a giant robot body, and unleashes an colossal energy beam at Samus, nearly killing her.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175124-155255.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175124\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.98461538461538\" data-width=\"130\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 130px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175124-155255.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175124\"><img alt=\"The Final Hazard - Mother Brain\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px\" data-width=\"130\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175124-155255.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175124-155255.jpg 130w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Final Hazard - Mother Brain\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175124-155255.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6827/175124-155255.jpg 130w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px\" data-width=\"130\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Final Hazard - Mother Brain</figcaption></figure><p>As Mother Brain is about to finish her off, the Metroid Hatchling attacks her, rescusing Samus. It drains power away from Mother Brain, and gives the energy it stole earlier to the bounty hunter, healing her wounds. Mother Brain, however, recovers, and destroys the Metroid, leaving it’s remains on Samus. With new power, Samus unleashes the incredibly powerful Hyper Beam on Mother Brain, destroying it once and for all. Doing so triggers a bomb in the base, and Samus escapes as the planet explodes in a massive supernova. On the way, she saves some of the planet’s indigenous species: Etecoons and Dachoras.</p><h2>Metroid Fusion</h2><p>In Cosmic year 20x5, a Galactic Federation exploration vessel discovered an unknown organism on SR388. The hovering creature was a Metroid, an entity that exhibited frightening parasitic, energy-absorbing properties.</p><p>Some time later, gifted bounty hunter Samus Aran was dispatched alone to engage the Zebesian Space Pirates who abducted the Metroid specimen for use as a weapon. On Zebes, Samus also encountered the biomechanical Mother Brain, leader of the Space Pirates, and dispatched her in a bitter fight. From then on, Metroids were viewed as a highly dangerous life form.</p><p>Eventually, Samus Aran was sent to SR388 to exterminate the last remaining Metroids, but only after an entire Federation platoon was wiped out in an earlier attempt.</p><p>At the end of her battle on SR388, one Metroid hatchling was born before Samus’s eyes and it imprinted upon her as a mother figure. Samus took this larval Metroid, the last in the universe, to the Galactic Space Academy for observation and research.</p><p>This research revealed several possible applications for Metroid-based technology for the betterment of humanity. The unique energy-absorption properties of Metroids could be harnessed when they were artificially reproduced in captivity.</p><p>Just when it seemed as if peace might prevail in the galaxy, Space Pirates returned to the Metroid hatchling and took it back to Zebes.</p><p>Samus followed the Pirates back to Zebes and fought to exterminate their threat and save the last Metroid.</p><p>In the final battle with Mother Brain, the hatchling saved Samus, giving up its life in the process. Samus succeeded in defeating the Mother Brain, but the universe lost the promise of using Metroids for the power of good.</p><p>SR388. A vile planet, former home of the Metroids. After so many years, the remaining creatures on this planet still seemed to be trying to recreate a natural hierarchy, one without Metroids at the top.</p><p>Biological Space Labs was hired by the Federation to observe this restructuring of the ecosystem. And because of Samus’s experience on SR388, the Federation governor for this sector hired her to provide field assistance on the planet. So, once again she found herself drawn to that forsaken rock.</p><p>The biological sample collection was going smoothly on the planet’s surface when she came into contact with an organism that she had never before encountered.</p><p>The organism was an undiscovered, unnamed parasitic life form, which the researchers later called “X.” Thinking little of it at the time, she boarded a ship and set out for the next collection point. Suddenly Samus felt her entire body seize up, and she lost consciousness. The ship began to drift away from planetary orbit toward an asteroid belt.</p><p>Thankfully, an auto-escape pod jettisoned her from the craft before the ship was destroyed. The researchers in the newly-constructed research station orbiting SR388 sent a shuttle to recover the pod shortly thereafter. However, in the time since Samus’s infection, the X had multiplied rapidly in her body and had even infected her Power Suit.</p><p>Samus’s heart rate and blood pressure dropped rapidly as she fell into a deep sleep coma. The Onboard Medic Simulation predicted only a 0.873% prognosis for survival. Samus was transported to Galactic Federation HQ for emergency medical treatment.</p><p>The fact that the Power Suit contained biological components and was also integrally connected to Samus’s body seemed to worsen the matter. The Federation surgeons were unable to remove the suit while Samus was unconscious. Their only choice was to cut and remove parts of the infected suit from her still-unconscious form. Immediately after, they sent the suit parts to the Biologic Space Labs research station for study.</p><p>Even with the parts removed, the X infection was spreading rapidly through Samus’s nervous system, and the researchers monitoring her deterioration knew of no cure.</p><p>Someone proposed a desperate treatment. A vaccine was created from Metroid cells. Apparently the Federation had preserved a cell culture from the last Metroid. The scientists quickly prepared and administered the vaccine. The symptoms of the infection disappeared instantly, and all of the X parasites within her died in moments.</p><p>When Samus woke, the scientists told her that the hatchlinghad saved her once again.</p><p>Almost immediately after she awoke, a distress call was received from the research station.</p><p>It said “Emergency! Explosion of unknown origin in the Quarantine Bay!” The screams from the com receiver were loud enough for Samus to hear even in the infirmary. She knew that something terrible was about to happen. Samus immediately boarded the ship the Federation had provided her and sent a message. It read “Docking with Biologic Space Labs station in 10 minutes. Prepare the landing bay!”</p><h2>To Save The Universe</h2><p>Months later, Samus received a job offer from the Federation once more. They wanted her to escort and bodyguard a group of scientists looking to collect creatures of SR-388. Samus accepted, and touched down on the planet. On the first expedition, a hostile creature attacked the scientists. Samus destroyed it, but then something else came. A free-floating parasite creature emerged from the hostile, and attacked Samus. Not seeing any apparent injuries, the group of scientists decided that they were finished and leaf the planet with Sa,s following close behind. As she begins to depart, she blacks out at the controls of her ship, and drifts into an asteroid belt. Moments before the collision, her ship ejects the escape pod with Samus in it, and the Biologic Space Labs ship picks it up drifting. It turns out that the parasite creature infects it’s host, ultimately killing it and stealing it’s body. Samus was only given a short time to live. Fighting to save her life, the scientists removed all of the infected parts of Samus's Power Suit. However, since the Suit was connected to her nervous system, she was conscious as the scientists did surgery on her. Fearing that hope of life was lost, someone searched for some form of cure, and eventually found it. It seemed that the Federation had preserved a DNA sampling of the Metroid Hatchling. Metroids were the main predator of the parasites, now being called the “X”. The DNA was made into a vaccine right away, and injected into Samus. She survived, and is given a new lease on life, and her suit is irreversibly changed into a new appearance.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/710754-metroid_fusion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-710754\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.1156558533145\" data-width=\"709\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 709px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:211.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/710754-metroid_fusion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-710754\"><img alt=\"Second Life - The Fusion Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/710754-metroid_fusion.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/710754-metroid_fusion.jpg 709w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/710754-metroid_fusion.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Second Life - The Fusion Suit\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/710754-metroid_fusion.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/710754-metroid_fusion.jpg 709w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/710754-metroid_fusion.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Second Life - The Fusion Suit</figcaption></figure><p>She realizes that she owes the Metroid Hatchling her life twice over. Samus is given a ship, but as a price, it has a A.I. CO on it, and she must complete a mission. She has been tasked with investigating the vessel where her parts and the infected creatures were stored. It seems an explosion has rocked the station, and none of the personnel are responding. She investigates the station, and finds that the explosion originated in the Quarantine Bay where the X hosts were being stored. The X had escaped their captivity, and quickly moved through the entire station, which is composed of various habitats for creatures. After trying several times to destroy the X, the A.I. CO reveals to Samus that the one that caused the explosion was none other than an X that remade her using the infected components of her suit. It is named the SA-X by the CO, who Samus names Adam, as a tribute to Samus's first commanding officer The SA-X, Adam explains, is superior to Samus in the fact that it has all of the suit's abilities and defences. If Samus were to engage it in direct combat, she would only have a eleven percent chance of survival. It then becomes the duos main priority to get Samus to her full power, so she can end the X once and for all. While investigating the station, she finds that the same Etecoons and Dachoras she rescued from Zebes have been in captivity. She frees them, and they hide out in her ship, after the CO has checked to make sure that they are free of X parasites. From gathering various support data from the Federation, Samus receives a good portion of her abilities. She is nearly at full battle capacity, and during a task from the CO she discovers a secret entrance, and enters a off-limits area of the station. It is there that she finds dozens of Metroids in captivity. While investigating, an explosion rocks the section, and Samus finds the SA-X trying to destroy the Metroids. The damage is sufficient enough to begin to detach the section from the rest of the station, and Samus escapes seconds before it separates and explodes. Getting back to the CO, she finds a fully healthy Ridley in cryo storage, frozen. Before her very eyes, a X parasite infects the frozen monster, and Ridley falls apart. She follows the X, and it turns into an evolved form of Ridley. After a long battle, Samus defeats it, and regains the Screwball. Finally making her way back to a comms room to talk with the AI, Adam reveals to her that after she gave the Metroid Hatchling to the Federation, they cloned it using it’s DNA samples. That is how the cure for the X virus was found so fast, and that is why there were Metroids in captivity. The Federation were speed growing them, and within weeks the Metroids were evolving from the basic form to the giant Omega Metroids. However, the X sensed the biggest threat to them was the Metroids, so the SA-X attacked them instead of Samus. It is then revealed to Samus that-since the X reproduce asexually-there are no less than ten SA-X’s on the station. Samus is furious at this, and insists that they must destroy the station. However, Adam locks her in the room, telling her that the Federation will come and capture the X for military purposes. Samus says that it is madness, the X will devour those that come aboard, and use their memories to gain knowledge, and will ultimately destroy all sentient life in the universe. Samus pleads will the AI, and accidentally calls the CO Adam in front of it. The AI begins to question Samus about Adam, and it is revealed that Adam died to let Samus live. Having a change of heart suddenly, the AI tells Samus that the only way to truly eradicate the X would be to program the station to crash into SR-388, wiping them out from both areas. The A.I. unlocks the doors, and asks Samus “Any objectives, Lady?\", like Adam did to her. Samus heads to the main control room, and right before ahe reaches her destination, another SA-X attacks her. Samus proves to be more than a match for it, and destroys it. As she is about to absorb the X parasite, it floats off and escapes. Samus programs the course to crash on SR-388, and is only given 6 minutes to escape to the Docking Bay. Samus arrives, but her ship is no where to be seen, and there is a broken Metroid egg. Suddenly, a monstrous Omega Metroid attacks Samus, and catches her off guard, almost destroying her. Before it can strike the final blow, the SA-X comes and rescues Samus, sensing that the Omega Metroid was a bigger threat. It is destroyed, however, and Samus absorbs the X parasite, gaining back the Ice Beam, the Metroids one true weakness. She destroys the Omega Metroid. Suddenly, her ship flies in and picks her up, and she escapes. The B.S.L. station crashes into SR-388, both are destroyed in a huge blast, and the X are eradicated. Samus realizes that the Federation implants the memories and minds of dead CO’s into AI’s. Adam is alive again to Samus. However, something still troubles her. Her ship could only be piloted manually, and Adam couldn’t do it himself. She asks him, and he responds “They gave me a hand”, and shows her that the Etecoons and Dachoras piloted the ship as a repayment to Samus, saving her. Samus is left to ponder how the citizens of the universe will handle her actions, but then dismisses it. Someone will understand. They have to.</p><h2>Timeline</h2><ul><li>*Metroid Manga (One Girl In All The World.

Once inside of her Power Suit, her durability is increased exponentially, allowing her to take massive damage and still remain combat ready. The defense of the suit increases with every Energy Tank that Samus collects-with the maximum amount, it takes dozens of explosive weapons until she begins to show sign of damage. The suit itself, though genius Chozo engineering, is compatible with every weapon or equipment system ever created or ever to be created. This is what allows Samus to take new abilities from fallen foes. Her suit is directly connected to her nervous system-to take it off quickly, it only requires a mental command, and vice versa. The suit has almost no programming, so it is unable to be hacked. However, it does have a data storage component, which is where Samus puts the acquired information of scanned foes. While using the Power Suit, Samus also has superhuman reflexes and physical strength. In order to use the Power Suit, she needs to use superhuman levels of mental concentration. Due to her Metroid DNA, Samus is also capable of absorbing life energy.</p><h3>Armor</h3><p>Samus's suit has been upgraded many times. While travelling, she has even found upgrades that change her suit to another, with upgraded characteristics.</p><ul><li>Power Suit - Built for her by the Chozo people. It is integrated with her body, acting as a sort of second skin, not only does it provide shielding in battle and augmented physical strength, but its life-support systems allow her to survive in water and even space without additional equipment.</li><li>Varia Suit (which allows her to survive massive temperatures) - With the Varia Suit, Samus is able to survive extremely high temperatures. Some versions grant her immunity to acids or cold.</li><li>Gravity Suit (allows Samus to move unhindered in water) - The Gravity suit negates the effects of water, allowing Samus to move and jump normally even while submerged. Some versions render her immune to magma. Metroid: Other M's suit protects from other impediments like explosive decompression and extreme gravity.</li><li>Phazon suit (Samus takes no damage from Phazon)</li></ul><p>Samus's suit also has other attributes, such as allowing her to breath and survive in space, and a meter that shows how close she is to danger.</p><p>The suit is compatible with any weapon system, and thus, it's combat applications are nearly endless. Because of this compatibility, Samus has amassed a huge stockpile of abilities and powers throughout her adventures. These include practical ones, such as the Space Jump (allowing her to repeatedly jump, and essentially fly), the Speed Booster (a device which allows her to move almost as fast as her beams, which is nearly the speed of a bullet. In this, she can run through walls-whether they be mountains or steel. She can also harness this speed into a move called \"Shinespark\", which allows her true flight until she hits something which stops her), Morph Ball (allows her to be folded down into a ball, and go into otherwise inaccessible areas), and the Grapple Beam (allows her to shoot out a electromagnetic beam that she can swing on. She may also use this ability to pull something to her, or drain energy from something). Weapons include multiple beams (Wave, which goes through walls and disrupts electronics-Spazer/Wide, which fires three shots simultaneously-Plasma, which fires rounds of superheated plasma capable of passing through multiple opponents-Ice, which freezes enemies. The fatal weakness of Metroids-and Phazon, which fires powerful energy blasts powered by Phazon), Missiles (rockets which are able to bring down large structures. Can fire up to six at a time, and home in on enemies. Also, a missile has a combo with any beam. Include creating miniature dimensional holes or flamethrowers), Bombs (small bombs dropped in Morph Ball mode. Can also drop a Power Bomb, which launches out a explosion about fifty feet high and wide that easily vaporizes Space Pirates. This technique may also heal Samus fully through the massive release of energy, though it is risky and may backfire), and the Screw Attack (a electricity field which surrounds Samus when she Space Jumps. She can deflect most attacks while doing so, and almost anything organic that she touches is blow to pieces). She can also charge her beams for a more powerful effect (a charged Power Beam, which is the default beam Samus uses, is stronger than three missiles).</p><p>After being attack by Dark Samus on Norion, Samus was infected with Phazon. She could temporarily harness this with the usage of the PED suit (Phazon Enhancement Device), which allowed her to enter a supercharged state called \"Hypermode\". In this she took no damage whatsoever, dealt out exponentially more powerful attacks, and was granted more abilities. However, staying in this form for too long would corrupt her in a being much like Dark Samus. She was cleansed of the infection at the end of the attack on Phaaze, and is thus back to normal.</p><p>Most recently, after being infected by the X, Samus had to have much of her Power Suit removed from her while she was still conscious-essentially being dissected while alive. However, she was injected with a Metroid vaccine, cleansing her of the infection and guaranteed that she could no longer become infected with any virus ever again. With this new Fusion Suit, Samus still retains all of the abilities that she use with her Power Suit.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><ul><li>Power Beam - Samus's standard beam. Can be fired continuously or charged up to fire a powerful blast.</li><li>Wave Beam - Fires three oscillating waves of energy. Has a limited homing effect.</li><li>Ice Beam - Can immobilize enemies briefly with a layer of ice. Some enemies are particularly vulnerable to this weapon, such as Metroids.</li><li>Plasma Beam - Launches streams of molten energy that can ignite some enemies and melt ice.</li><li>Bombs - energy based explosives that can be used while in the Morph Ball. Unlimited amount.</li><li>Power Bomb - Super-powered bombs that will affect everything within a certain distance of their explosions. Limited amount.</li></ul><p>The suit's storage capacity for combat applications also have no limits-when Samus picks up a missile, it would seem that the Power Suit is able to shrink it down and store it into her arm-cannon. Whether or not there is a limit is unknown, but the maximum amount Samus has carried at once is 250.</p><h3>Visors</h3><p>The Power Suit has several different Visors. Among them are the...</p><ul><li>Combat Visor - This default visor is standard for battle and provides Samus with all the general information she needs.</li><li>Scan Visor (which allows Samus to scan a target for attributes, abilities, and weaknesses. The bigger the target, the longer the scan) - When Samus uses the Scan Visor, a magnifying reticule will appear in the center of her visor, this reticule picks out anything that can be scanned. From creatures to computer terminals.</li><li>The Thermal Visor (allows Samus to see in infra-red) - The Thermal Visor allows Samus to track enemies using their heat signatures. Not only does this visor help locate enemies hidden in dark areas, but it can be used for acquiring alternate targets on enemies. A thermal scan can often find a hidden weak spot on an otherwise difficult enemy. Not only that, but thermal scans show other clues that the naked eye can't discern.</li><li>The X-Ray Visor (allows Samus to see in X-Ray vision, obviously) - The X-Ray Visor allows Samus to peer through walls to find hidden passages and even see invisible objects. This visor also helps track any enemies that use optical camouflage to render themselves invisible to the naked eye.</li><li>The Echo Visor (allows Samus to see in echolocation)</li></ul><h3>Game List</h3><ul><li>*Metroid</li><li>*Metroid II: Return of Samus</li><li>*Super Metroid</li><li>*Metroid Fusion</li><li>*Metroid Prime</li><li>*Metroid Zero Mission</li><li>*Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</li><li>*Metroid Prime Pinball</li><li>*Metroid Prime: Hunters</li><li>*Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</li><li>*Super Smash Bros</li><li>*Super Smash Bros Melee</li><li>*Super Smash Bros. Brawl</li><li>*Metroid: Other M</li></ul><p>Also of note is that all three Prime games were re-released on the Wii in North America as Metroid Prime Trilogy, and in Japan as separate titles. The re-releases of the Gamecube titles offer new and improved motion controls, for more precise aiming.</p>",

From the first episode she was introduced in, she made it her goal to get <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20125\" href=\"/willow/4005-20125/\" slug=\"willow\"> Willow</a>.

    "description": "<h2>Disambiguation</h2><p>This page is for the 1st Ravager, Grant Wilson.</p><ul><li>For the 2nd Ravager, see: <a href=\"/jackal/4005-9951/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9951\">William Walsh</a></li><li>For the 3d Ravager, see: <a href=\"/wade-defarge/4005-63310/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63310\">Wade DeFarge</a></li><li>For the 4th Ravager, see: <a href=\"/ravager/4005-12890/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12890\">Rose Wilson</a></li></ul><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Wilsons</h3><p>Grant's parents met while in service to the United States Army, where <a href=\"/adeline-kane-wilson/4005-9946/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9946\">Adeline Kane</a> had been <a href=\"/deathstroke/4005-3588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3588\">Slade Wilson</a>'s instructor in guerilla warfare. They quickly fell in love and later wed.</p><p>As Slade was called into service, Adeline gave birth to a son, Grant. Slade continued on active duty, and volunteered for a medical experiment in resisting truth serums. The experiment had an unforeseen side effect: it gave Slade enhanced strength and heightened reflexes. Shortly after this, Adeline gave birth to a second son, <a href=\"/jericho/4005-9949/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9949\">Joseph William Wilson</a>.</p><p>Slade soon was discharged from the army. He took up hunting for awhile, but it failed to quench his thirst for the life he once led. Unknown to his wife and family, Slade secretly became a mercenary known as Deathstroke, the Terminator. Although Slade was gone for weeks a time, he was a good father. He was closest to Grant, who idolized him. But Slade also loved Joseph, who preferred music over fighting and painting over guns.</p><p>Adeline and Deathstroke together confronted the Jackal in an alleyway in Tangiers. Slade refused to give the Jackal the information he requested, because it would violate his professional code of ethics. Slade gambled he could react fast enough to save his son; He saved Joseph's life, but not before one of Jackal's men had begun to slit his throat. Joseph was now mute. Slade always needed to be the best. But now, his own son suffered for his monumental ego.</p><p>Adeline - furious at Slade's betrayal and the risking of her son's life - confronted Slade at gunpoint. Only Slade's quick reflexes saved his life, but he lost his right eye due to the gunshot inflicted by his wife. Adeline then divorced Slade and raised her two sons by herself. Grant followed in his father's footsteps and attended military school.</p><h3>The Revenge Of The Ravager</h3><p>Grant was a sullen and angry child who both loved his father and hated him. He ran away when he was seventeen and moved to <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>'s East Village, where he joined the local teen gangs.</p><p>His life was thrown into disarray when the alien <a href=\"/starfire/4005-2389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2389\">Starfire</a> crashed into his apartment as she escaped her Gordanian captors. His apartment suffered even more damage as the <a href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\">New Teen Titans</a> entered the scene. Grant demanded reparation for damages, but was told he would not be compensated. A bitter and angry man to begin with, Grant's rage toward the Titans festered. Things became worse when he arrived at his ex-girlfriend Carol's apartment and tried to win her back. When Grant started to get rough, <a href=\"/donna-troy/4005-4913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4913\">Wonder Girl</a> and Starfire intervened and chased him away.</p><p>The criminal organization known as the <a href=\"/hive/4060-33317/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-33317\">H.I.V.E.</a> offered to amplify Grant's natural abilities artificially so he could exact his revenge on the Teen Titans, whom he blamed for ruining his life. Grant was offered his position in H.I.V.E. by the <a href=\"/jackal/4005-10974/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\">Jackal</a>, who, unbeknownst to Grant, was actually trying to get Grant killed, in order to get to Slade. Grant Wilson was the instrument of destruction to unleash on the Titans, since the H.I.V.E. were unsuccessful in recruiting Deathstroke – Grant’s own father – for that same mission. Grant received powers and a costume reminiscent of his father's and named himself the Ravager. Whereas Deathstroke’s abilities were amplified so that 90% of his brain capacity was being used, the H.I.V.E. offered to increase Grant's mental faculties to 100%. This made the powers unstable, a fact the H.I.V.E. knew well in advance.</p><p>The Ravager attacked the Titans, but his attempts to kill them were interrupted by Deathstroke. Ravager fought alongside Deathstroke, never knowing his fellow mercenary was also his father. Deathstroke was there to save his son’s life, only to be forced into a battle he never wished to wage. Then, tragedy struck. The experiment was a failure, and Grant’s powers proved too taxing for his body. Slade Wilson could only watch as the Ravager – his first born son – died in his arms.</p><p>Upon Grant’s death, Slade swore to fulfill his son’s contract and destroy the Teen Titans in his stead. This, of course, was exactly what the H.I.V.E. engineered all along. They planned Grant's death in order to force Deathstroke into their employ.</p><h3>Afterlife</h3><p>Grant was temporarily resurrected by <a href=\"/brother-blood/4005-12510/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12510\">Brother Blood</a> to guard <a href=\"/kid-eternity/4005-9363/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9363\">Kid Eternity</a>. In the <i>Teen Titans</i> tie-in to the <a href=\"/the-blackest-night/4045-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\"><i>Blackest Night</i></a> crossover, Grant Wilson was reanimated as a member of the <a href=\"/black-lantern-corps/4060-50743/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50743\">Black Lantern Corps</a>, attacking father and half-sister, <a href=\"/ravager/4005-12890/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12890\">Rose</a>.</p><p>Grant also appeared in <i>Booster Gold</i>, where he was manipulated into killing the <a href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\">Teen Titans</a> by the time traveling <a href=\"/black-beetle/4005-53273/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53273\">Black Beetle</a> (who used his powers to prevent Grant's body from deteriorating during the fight). However, <a href=\"/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\">Booster Gold</a> saved the day by posing as Deathstroke (with the the Titan <a href=\"/raven/4005-3584/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3584\">Raven's</a> aid) during Grant's death in order to ensure that the past remained unchanged.</p><h2>The New 52</h2><h3>Apparent Revival</h3><p>In the New 52, <a href=\"/deathstroke/4005-3588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3588\">Deathstroke</a> is offered a job to go and steal some 'Nuclear Secrets'. However, when he retrieves the package and opens it, it is apparent to the reader that the contents of the package are not the nuclear secrets but something else, even though the reader cannot see what exactly is contained within the box. Slade Wilson (Deathstroke's alter ego) however does not like the fact that his employer sent him to retrieve this because apparently the package sent a specific message to Slade and it could not be a coincidence that someone sent Slade <i>specifically</i> to retrieve it. Later, it is revealed that the package is actually Grant Wilson's old Ravager mask along with his blade. It also seems that the blood on it is fresh enough that there is a possibility Grant is still alive, though he is supposed to have died some years ago in an undisclosed incident. He appears to have been beaten and killed in an explosion by Midnighter.</p><p>Grant was hired to kill his father by the wealthy parents of a girl who was a part of the mercenary group Slade worked with, and later killed, because he didn't like competition. Through flashbacks to his home life and training you see Grant's struggle for approval from his father, but also his incredible ability. Grant goes on to confront his father in a hybrid of Legacy armor and his own. After subduing a wounded and tired Deathstroke, Grant is suddenly electrocuted; but not by Deathstroke. The parents of the girl who Slade killed are revealed to have put Grant down for lying about his connection to Deathstroke. The girl's parents give Deathstroke the option of killing Grant instead of being a target for their assassins, however Deathstroke tells them 'he has no son', and that he doesn't 'negotiate'. Slade then stabs the father in the stomach, leaving him to bleed out; the mother pulls a gun and shoots Slade a few times, but to no effect, as Slade grins and stabs her through the face. Slade falls to the ground from loss of blood; Grant picks up his sword and contemplates killing his father, but in the end, he leaves him to live. Grant's hatred toward his father may stem from his father's manipulation of his brother's and mother's apparent death by the North Koreans that attacked their home.</p><p>Grant has resurfaced yet again with his mother and is under the control of his brother Jericho. Grant was used as a distraction to keep Wade and Rose distracted long enough for Jericho to gain control of Majestic, an engineered hero with powers similar to Superman.</p><p> </p><h2>DC: Rebirth</h2><p>As of <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/dc-rebirth/4015-56950/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56950\">DC Rebirth</a>, Grant's story has been reverted to a story similar to the original. For reasons unknown, Grant joined up with H.I.V.E, and subsequently died while he was a member.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Grant has enhanced strength, regeneration and reflexes. He is proficient in the use of conventional weapons.</p><p>In the New 52 Universe, Grant has enhanced speed, strength, regeneration, longevity and reflexes, along with skill in the use of knives, swords and guns. He was able to defeat a slightly wounded and tired Deathstroke, and subdue him.</p>",

When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a> runs into him, Muhammad stares at him, accusing him of ignoring Harlem and especially the black community.

    "description": "<p>The boy who would become Sanosuke Sagara began life living in the Shinano Province where he lived with his family, but at the age of nine he left home to join the Sekiho Troop. However when the Meji goverment deemed the troop to be useless, the entire troop besides Sanosuke, leaving Sanosuke with a deep hatred for the government. As Sanosuke grew he became exceptionally strong, being perhaps the only person to be strong enough to use the sword zanbato, leading to his nick name of Zanza. </p>Sanosuke begins the manga being hired by a former enemy of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45133\" href=\"/kenshin/4005-45133/\" slug=\"kenshin\">Kenshin</a> to assassinate the wanderer, but following being defeated becomes a close ally, over several battles where he fought alongside Kenshin.   Eventually a former enemy of Kenshin's,<a data-ref-id=\"4005-51201\" href=\"/saito/4005-51201/\" slug=\"saito\">Saito</a> returns to the dojo, during which he attacks Sanosuke wounding him badly, in an effort to judge Kenshin's skill without his vow to never kill to interfere. Kenshin eventually leaves in order to slay <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51136\" href=\"/shishio/4005-51136/\" slug=\"shishio\">Shishio</a> without telling anyone farewell, this along with the teasing of Saito spurs Sanosuke to follow and train along the way.  <br/> <br/>During Sanosuke's journey he becomes lost in the woods, where he comes along fallen monk <a data-ref-id=\"4005-66293\" href=\"/anji/4005-66293/\" slug=\"anji\">Anji</a>,who becomes his teacher at the technique  <i>Futae no Kiwami, </i>which makes Sanosuke vastly stronger. Eventually he arrives where he goes to battle Shisho and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-51220\" href=\"/ten-swordsjuppongatana/4060-51220/\" slug=\"ten-swordsjuppongatana\">Juppongatana</a>.During the entrance into Shisho's stronghold, Sanosuke is the first to battle where he quickly is forced to fight his teacher Anji. Sanosuke eventually manages to reach Anji, who gives up on his violent path allowing Kenshin and Saito to continue on. ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Very little is known about Caprice's past or even the origin of her telepathy. She was one of the people responsible for targeting superhuman villains for assassination on behalf of the <a href=\"/scourge/4005-14461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14461\">Scourge of the Underworld</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Caprice was created by <a href=\"/mark-gruenwald/4040-41607/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41607\">Mark Gruenwald</a> and <a href=\"/mc-wyman/4040-25626/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-25626\">M.C. Wyman</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/usagent/4050-19601/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19601\">U.S.Agent</a> #2.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Caprice has only had two notable appearances to date, and is unlikely to appear again. Originally, Caprice was just a woman with exceptional combat skills who was also a master of disguise (nay, she wore funny wigs) and skilled at psychologically torturing people. However, when she was brought back ten years later in <a href=\"/warren-ellis/4040-40893/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40893\">Warren Ellis</a>' run on <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4050-18128/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18128\">Thunderbolts</a>, she was shown to exhibit telepathic powers without explanation (although perhaps it explains her aptitude and skill at torturing people).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Scourge of the Underworld</h3><p>The <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avenger</a> known as <a href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\">U.S.Agent</a> had been tracking and investigating the Scourge program for months but wasn't making much headway since all his leads wound up dead before any progress could be made. When <a href=\"/vagabond/4005-41288/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41288\">a woman</a> that the Agent had saved from the Scourge a few months earlier came to him with information about the program, both she and the Agent found themselves targets of a member of the Scourge group called Decker. Having escaped and captured their would-be assasssin, U.S. Agent opted to go under cover pretending to be Decker assuming that his handler may not have seen his real face underneath the Scourge mask.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2453407\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2453407-caprice.jpg\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1476091476091\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2453407-caprice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2453407\"><img alt=\"Caprice tortures US Agent\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2453407-caprice.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2453407-caprice.jpg 962w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2453407-caprice.jpg 960w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2453407-caprice.jpg 836w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px\" data-width=\"836\"></a><figcaption>Caprice tortures US Agent</figcaption></figure><p>U.S.Agent's brilliant plan backfires quickly when he meets the handler - Caprice - who instantly deduces he is not Decker, shoots him with a tranquillizer and takes him to a hideout where she tortures him in a steambath. After using her telepathic gift to make the Agent to relive several of the worst moments in his life, Caprice and her partner <a href=\"/bloodstain/4005-79750/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79750\">Bloodstain</a> discovered his true identity and his status as an Avenger. Realising they couldn't kill the Agent without inciting investigation from the Avengers, the two decided to manipulate the Agent into joining them and becoming an assassin for them. As Caprice telepathically manipulated the Agent allowing Bloodstain to appear to him as his long-thought dead brother wishing to enlist him in their cause.</p><p>After being freed from captivity, the Agent returned to where he had hidden both Decker and his informant only to discover the whole thing was a trick to learn of their location. After an ambush and killing Decker, Bloodstain accidentally shot Caprice when she got in the way of his shot intended for Agent's informant. After Bloodstrain fled, U.S.Agent co-erced information from the wounded Caprice in an effort to help him expose whoever is behind the Scourge program. Caprice was taken to hospital and received medical care for her wound while U.S.Agent confronted the benefactor of the Scourge program, the World War II hero <a href=\"/angel/4005-36389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36389\">Angel</a>, and had a final fight with Bloodstain which ended in the villain's death.</p><h3>Caged Angels</h3><p>After the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Superhuman Civil War</a>, Caprice was wanted for being in violation of the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\">Superhuman Registration Act</a> and was pursued by the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a>. When confronted by the team, she quickly surrendered to the team and was taken to <a href=\"/thunderbolts-mountain/4020-53342/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-53342\">Thunderbolts Mountain</a> where she was imprisoned. Elsewhere, a supervillain known as <a href=\"/mindwave/4005-46678/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46678\">Mindwave</a> also surrendered to the Thunderbolts without any resistance. <a href=\"/songbird/4005-3281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3281\">Songbird</a> believed this was because they feared <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a> who had recently been seen biting off <a href=\"/steel-spider/4005-18429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18429\">Steel Spider</a>'s arm when he refused to surrender to the team.</p><p>However, both of these surrenders were a ploy to be reunited with fellow prisoners <a href=\"/mirage/4005-54783/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54783\">Mirage</a> and <a href=\"/bluestreak/4005-54787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54787\">Bluestreak</a>, who had a plan to destroy the Thunderbolts from within. All four of the prisoners possessed telepathic abilities, and began manipulating <a href=\"/moonstone/4005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\">Moonstone</a>, <a href=\"/andreas-von-strucker/4005-4815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4815\">Swordsman</a>, Venom and the team's director, <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a>. All hell broke out after the quartet manipulated Norman Osborn into becoming the Green Goblin again, Swordsman into leading an insurrection against his fellow Thunderbolts, Venom into eating every living person he came into contact with, and Moonstone into attacking <a href=\"/doc-samson/4005-4315/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4315\">Doc Samson</a> and <a href=\"/speedball/4005-2104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2104\">Penance</a>. Amidst the chaos of their own making, none of the four had taken into account <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye</a>, who was undergoing surgery at the time after being half beaten to death by <a href=\"/american-eagle/4005-41819/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41819\">American Eagle</a>. Following the successful operation and with security otherwise detained by the ensuing chaos, Bullseye was able to simply walk away into the Thunderbolt Mountain holding cells and murder all four of the telepaths. He had little regard for the havoc they had caused, but wanted some target practice. Caprice was killed by Bullseye when he threw a scalpel directly into her forehead.</p>",

    "description": "<h3>Origin</h3><p>Shortly after an adult <a href=\"/john-connor/4005-15996/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15996\">John Connor</a> emerged from his bunker in 2009 after a nuclear winter, he came under the attack of <a href=\"/skynet/4005-28784/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28784\">Skynet</a> and the <a href=\"/terminators/4005-28786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28786\">Terminators</a>. John found himself under the gun of a Terminator when he was saved at the last moment. The Terminator was shot in the head and destroyed. Looking up to see who his savior was, a leather-gloved hand reached out and said, \"Come with me if you want to live.\" Seeing a huge bald \"man\" in a leather coat and dark sunglasses, John asked who he was. The \"man\" told John he could call him, \"Uncle Bob.\" John's savior \"Uncle Bob\" is actually a terminator sent by John Connor's future self. Uncle Bob's role is to help John get over the loss of Katherine Brewster and become the leader he was born to be. Skynet sent the T-Infinity prototype to eliminate Uncle bob and correct anomalies in the timeline that will lead towards Skynet's destruction.</p><h3>Fun Facts</h3><p>Uncle Bob is the name the young John Connor gave his T-800 protector when introducing him to Enrique in Terminator 2: Judgement Day.</p>",

She was only 11 years old at the time and had no memories of anything before. He took her in and raised her as his own. However, his duties as a captain of the U.S. Navy kept him away from home most of the time, but it never stopped him telling Aspen that he loves her. Aspen always calls her adoptive father \"Captain,\" as it has become a habit.</p><p>After Aspen discovers her powers and <a href=\"/james-maylander/4005-46345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46345\"> Admiral Maylander</a> went after her, she turned to Captain Matthews. However, Captain Matthews was not answering his phone, so she and <a href=\"/chance-calloway/4005-46650/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46650\"> Chance </a>went to his house in the desert. Captain Matthews was found in his bedroom unable to move. It turns out to be a trap set by Maylander, Aspen would use her powers to break out and the three of them took off in Chance's car. When Aspendecided to go with her brother <a href=\"/finn/4005-41313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41313\"> Finn</a>, to help the <a href=\"/blue/4060-41253/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41253\"> Blues </a>defend against the humans, Captain Matthews and Chance went to <a href=\"/mexico/4020-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55820\"> Mexico </a>to lay low for awhile, and waited for Aspen to return.</p>",

Rahger tries to convince her to join them to punish the humans for what they've done wrong. Aspen denies, leaving her father and the Black to return to the surface.</p><p>Months after the war between the Blue and humans, Cannon receives some news that Rahger and the Black planned to punish the humans so he goes to Aspen about the situation of her father's plot. After the Black made their final push, Aspen confronts Rahger using every power she has against him, he gets an upper hand and attacks her with his electric attack. Chance Calloway manages to stop Rahger's attack with a help of a stranger that shot him with a deadly weapon that dries him. Before dying and being carried back to the deep with his group, Rahger shows Aspen's true birthmark that she's still one of the Black.</p>",

When he was still the captain of the 9th Division, He wore the standard shinigami uniform with his captain's haori over it He also wore an goggles, an orange scarf around his neck, white boots, and black, fingerless gloves.</p><p>After his defection, Tosen change his appearance. His clothing became similar to an Arrancar and he no longer tied his braids in a ponytail. He wore a white sleeveless coat over black hakama, white boots, longer gloves, band-like visor, and an orange rope coming from his right shoulder running across his chest to under his left arm.</p><p> </p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Tosen was a man that claimed to believe in peace. His life philosophy was to \"take the path with the least bloodshed\". According to him, this was the reason for his defection. He was shown to be prideful and arrogant sometimes. He referred to himself as a \"pure being\" on more than one occasion. He does not feel remorse over his actions when he feels he is doing it for the right reasons. When he was still 5th seat in the 9th division, he willing to attack and kill members of his own division and hollowfy his own captain,</p><p><a href=\"/kensei-muguruma/4005-56788/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56788\"> Kensei Muguruma</a>. <a href=\"/kenpachi/4005-42566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42566\">Zaraki Kenpachi</a> has stated that Tosen and <a href=\"/gin-ichimaru/4005-42858/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42858\">Gin Ichimaru</a> are both afraid of death. Tosen later confirms this by saying he \"only feared being assimilated into the Shinigami culture and dying a pointless death\".He has an extreme dislike for <a href=\"/grimmjow-jeagerjaques/4005-51667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51667\">Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez</a> and Kenpachi because he feels they are both killing machines that only cause more bloodshed in the world and this goes against his personal philosophy.</p><p> </p><h3>Past:</h3><p> </p><p>Kaname Tousen decided to join the shinigami academy, in memory of someone very close to him. Not much is known about his early life or how he came to meet this particular woman, but her views on life was something Tousen decided to follow himself. Eventually his friend was accepted into the shinou academy, and eventually became a shinigami, in order to bring peace to the world. At some point she married, but things took a turn for the worse, when over an argument with her husband about his actions over killing anther over a petty quarrel she was killed. Tousen tried to get an audience with the central 46 over his friends killer getting the death penalty, but he was turned away. From that point on Tousen dedicated his life to following the path of justice, for his friend, and her beautiful world.</p><p> </p><p>Tousen would become a member of the 5th division, it was their he first met Aizen Sosuke. During a walk Tousen would first meet Sajin Komamura, whom he didn't notice at first, something which suprised him, as Komamura was the first person to completely hid his spiritual power away from Tousen's senses. At that point on the two became best friends. Tousen becoming happy that his friend too would become a shinigami, who told Tousen that he joined because he owed a debt to someone who saved his life. Tousen would often talk about his friend, always telling of her beautiful world. At some pont Tousen would transfer to the ninth division, becoming the 5th seat under Kensei Muguruma.</p><p> </p><h3>Turn Back The Pendulum</h3><p>Along with other members of his division, including his captain, and his lieutenant Msociety, Mashiro Kuna. Tousen and the ninth division are sent on a mission to investigate a series of odd disappearances that have been occurring around soul society despite a vanguard already been sent out, which Mashiro notes. During their search Tousen and the other seated members have to put up with Mashiro's childish antics, and having to restrain their captain. During their search, they notice a group of young orphans being attacked by a large hollow. The group head to kill the hollow but their attack is useless. Eventually the hollow is killed by Kensei's shikai.</p><p> </p><p>The ninth division go onto find some clothing, which belonged to the original search squad. Thinking the attacker will eventually move closer into the soul society, Kensei asks request for a researcher from the 12th division to come, while he sets up camp in order to stop the atacker in case it decides to atack. Tousen goes along with his captain.</p><p> </p><p>Standing guard outside his captains tent, the other two members arrive, and try and take over Kaname's position, allowing him to rest, but Kaname thinks the should all take guard. At this point Tousen kills his partners, and he himself is also believed dead by Kensei, who Tousen attacks using his bankai. Later on when Shinji arrives, and asks why Tousen betrayed his captain. Aizen reveals himself to be behd the mysterious atacks along with Gin, and tells Shinji that Tousen was following orders, his own. When the group of future vizards have been subdued through hollowfication Tousen has a short fight with Shinji. He also shows some fear towards Aizen. Eventually the trio leave, after a interaction with Kisuke and Tessla, whom tries to stop the trio with a kido spell, but Aizen blocks it. Due to Aizen's abilities the trio get away with their crimes.</p><p> </p><h3>Captain</h3><p> </p><p>At some point in time Tousen would eventually rise the ranks and become the captain of the ninth division. Replacing the man he had once betrayed. During his time as a captain, Tousen would meet Shuhei Hisagi, whom he had helped saved many years before. Tousen would become a mentor type figure to Hisagi, guiding him in life, and helping shape him into a strong shinigami. Tousen would help Hisagi through many hard times, his own views of feeling fear in battle, and following a path of justice, was taken up by Hisagi.</p><p> </p><h3>Meeting The King Of Hueco Mundo</h3><p>At some point in time Tousen along with Aizen and gin go to hueco mundo, in order to meet up with the current king Barragan Luisenbarn. Barragan welcomes the men to his palace. Kaname attacks and kills a large hollow. Tousen questions how a place with no ceiling can be a palace, which Barragan claims the very sky itself is his ceiling. Aizen tells him subbordinate off for trying to start a battle. When Aizen asks Barragan to join him, the king laughs at Aizen and tells his army to kill, but it is then that Aizen reveals Kyoka Suigetsu, revealing that Barragan had been caught in an illusion, showing that while the two were talking, Gin and Kaname had decimated his army.</p><p> </p><h3>Soul Society Captains</h3><p>Tousen makes his first official appearance during the meeting of the captains, dealing with the sudden invasion of Ichigo and his friends. Tousen goes on to tell Ichimaru, that Ukiatake is relieved from the meeting due to his illness.</p><p> </p><p>After the apparent death of Sosuke Aizen. Tousen along with Komamura go to check up on the autopsy done by Retsu Unohana, whom confirms that the death is indeed real and is not a fake body. She tells the captains to return. On heir way they run into their respective lieutenant. When Hisagi asks about Aizen, Tousen just shakes his head, and tells them they should deal with the invasion.</p><p> </p><p><u><b>Tousen vs Zaraki Kenpachi</b></u></p><p>Later on Tousen with Komamura, stand before Kenpachi and question why he decided to help the invaders. It is at this time that Tousen reveals his feelings for Kenpachi, seeing him nothing more than a demon that disturbs the peace. Tousen and Sajin then do battle with Kenpachi, each using their shikai, but are shocked that kenpachi can survive such attacks. Tousen then goes onto explain how one can become a captain, as he uses his bankai, gaining the advantage, but Kenpachi quickly figures out how to get past Tousen's bankai, and easily defeats his fellow captain, but before he can kill him Sajin steps in.</p><p> </p><h3>Betrayal</h3><p>After that Tousen is not shown for a while, but later appears in front of Renji Abari who is carrying Rukia Kuchiki, having been healed of the wounds he suffered at the hands of Kenpachi. Tousen uses a special kind of material to teleport himself to Aizen's location, were he reveals that himself, along with Aizen and Gin are traitors. Tousen watches multiple attempts by Renji, Ichigo and Komamura to put a stop to Aizen only to fail. Later on when the trio attempt to leave, they are captured, with Tousen being captured by Hisagi. The 3 are then saved by the hollows, and depart to hueco mundo. An angry Sajin questions were Tousen's justice is, but Tousen assures him that he is following the path of least bloodshed.</p><p> </p><h3> </h3><h3>Betrayal:</h3><p><u><b>Hollowfication</b></u></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052746-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1052746\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 500px\" data-ratio=\"0.932\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052746-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1052746\"><img alt=\"White Despair Tosen's hollowfication release\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052746-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052746-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png 500w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052746-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>White Despair Tosen's hollowfication release</figcaption></figure><p>In recent chapters it has been revealed that Aizen has granted Tosen with a power greater than bankai, and one which places him on a new level of power. This is revealed to be hollowfication, the same process which granted the</p><p><a href=\"/vizards/4060-46640/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46640\"> vizard</a></p><p>'s and</p><p><a href=\"/ichigo/4005-42468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\"> Ichigo Kurosaki</a></p><p>hollow based powers. Like them Tosen places his hand in front of his face and gathers spiritual energy that summons a hollow mask. The process of summoning this mask is so great a huge burst of spiritual energy is released, causing Komamura and Hisagi to shield themselves. The mask is completely white save for a slit down the center. It covers his entire head and neck apart from a hole in the back which allows his hair to hang loose. His upper body attire also changes, he loses the sash and his chest area becomes more armored.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052747-08_6_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1052747\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 664px\" data-ratio=\"0.5316265060241\" data-width=\"664\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052747-08_6_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1052747\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052747-08_6_1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052747-08_6_1.jpg 664w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052747-08_6_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>In this form Tosen has revealed to be incredibly strong. Just like any other who has been through the same process he gains a great increase in spiritual power. Due to not only using his own energy but the energy around him. Even summoning his mask caused a huge amount of spiritual power to be released. His speed also increases, moving fast enough and cutting Hisagi before he was even aware of his former captain's movement. His strength also increases, he was able to stop Komamura's shikai with his blade using one hand, and looking away. He also kicked Sajin with enough force that sent him crashing to the building's below.</p><p> </p><h3><u>Resureccion</u></h3><p>Like the <a href=\"/arrancar/4060-47805/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47805\">Arrancar</a>s' and <a href=\"/espada/4060-56071/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56071\">Espada</a> Aizen has gone as far as giving Tosen and Gin a Resureccion a power that only the Arrancar/Espada were thought to have. His resureccion is called Suzumushi Hyakushiki Grillar Grillo, which transforms him into a large fly like instectoid. His resureccion also restores Tosen's eye sight. His resurreccion gives him a sound based attack of tremendous power.</p>",

She is 7 feet tall and has enhanced strength. However she does not seem to be a particularly skilled fighter, indicating inexperience. She can fly by using an \"Imperial Flight Patch\".
