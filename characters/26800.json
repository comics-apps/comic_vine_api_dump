    "deck": "Rohlan is a Mandalorian Crusader. He fought as a commander in the Mandalorian Wars. Rohlan, later deserted and rescued Jarael from the mad scientist, Demagol. Demagol incapacitated Rohlan and switched armor with him. Rohlan stood trail for Demagol’s crimes and finally after his escape, he killed Demagol.",
    "description": "<h2>Search for Answers<br/></h2><p> Later in his career as a Mandalorian veteran, Rohlan began to have a difficulty understanding the reasons and brutality of the war. So, Rohlan confronted his superiors with his questions, only to be given shaky and non descriptive answers, so he fled before being called to duty. Rohlan was discovered, and sent to the front lines. In his last mission Rohlan’s Shocktrooper force captured Jarel. Rohlan stole the ship, the Last Resort, and tried to escape. This ultimately failed and Camper and Zayne Carrick incapacitated Rohlan. They all headed to Flashpoint Station.  <br/></p><h2>Flashpoint Station<br/></h2> <p> Rohlan, as Zayne’s prisoner, directed Zayne to Flashpoint Station. When they arrived they met Demagol an insane Mandalorian scientist. Demagol was about to experiment on Jarael, untill Rohlan, demanded that Zayne be the next \"experiment.\" As Zayne was being experimented on, Rohlan overwhelmed the scientist. Demagol was left locked in a closet and Zayne took his armor. Zayne, using the Force, secretly placed charges that would level the building. Rohlan told the evacuating Mandalorians to tell Mandalore that he died trying to save Demagol. Rohlan returned to retrieve Demagol. Demagol however, tricked and drugged Rohlan. The scientist then switched armors with Rohlan. Rohlan, who was now believed to be Demagol, was captured and brought back to Corucant by the Jedi. However, he fell into coma caused by Demagol’s drugs.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Professor Tomoe is Hotaru Tomoe's father. He appears in Episode 90 of the anime and Act 25 of the manga. He is also second in command of the Death Busters.</p><p>In the manga Tomoe is just plain evil. After a lab fire killed his family and wounded his daughter Hotaru he joined the Death Busters of his own free will. Later in the manga he turns into a Germatoid so he could fight Sailor Moon, but he ended up being killed by her instead and unlike the anime, he does not come back.</p><p>In the anime he is a more sympathetic character. He displays bizarre, but hilariously overdramatic mannerisms, which are often a source of unexpected humor. Its never reviled if these are simply being part Germatoid or repressed aspects of his personality. His normal personality does show through at times, showing him to be a kind and loving father. At the end of Sailor Moon S, he is shown wheelchair-bound in a hospital with no memory of any of his Death Buster activities. He has taken it upon himself to re-raise the now infant Hotaru.</p><p>Professor Tomoe makes one more appearance in the anime, namely in episode 167 (the first episode of the Sailor Stars season), when Sailor Pluto arrives to take baby Hotaru from him. In this episode, he is seen without his glasses, and no longer relies on a wheelchair, indicating that his condition is improving. He is never seen or heard of after that.</p>",

She is the chief of security at Aquarius. The primary focus of the Aquarius Corporation is biocircuitry. They also have a a telepathic quadriplegic named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50916\" href=\"/billy-challas/4005-50916/\" slug=\"billy-challas\">Billy Challas</a>.</p><h2>The Ronin</h2><p>While giving a tour of the complex, Casey is interrupted by a demon named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67387\" href=\"/agat/4005-67387/\" slug=\"agat\">Agat</a>, who had broken through the security defenses, and attempted to kill Billy Challas . Virgo intervened and caused an explosion that expelled both Billy- who had been turned into the ronin, and Agat. Casey is urged by Virgo to go out and find the ronin, but she skeptical as to why. Virgo explains to Casey that she had to create the explosion to save Billy Challas, but Casey believes that Virgo’s logic units are malfunctioning. Casey Eventually begins an investigation into the Ronin as a part of her report, and sets out to find him.</p><p>Casey gathers up her men to go into the city and find the ronin, but when three of her men eventually locate the ronin, they are all murdered. Casey is shown the surveillance of what happened and is finally convinced that Virgo’s story is true. Casey requests to go back out to capture the ronin, and kill him. Mr. Taggart gives Casey only tasers, and instructs her to bring him back alive. Casey is unaware that Mr. Taggart has been killed and Agat has taken over his body.</p><p>Virgo reveals to Casey that she knows where the ronin is, but is worried that Casey may try to avenge her fallen comrades, if she tells where he is, but Casey reassures Virgo of her orders. While on the chase for the ronin, Virgo scans Casey, and discovers that she has a magnum on her hip. Casey finally tracks the ronin down, and fires her gun at him. The ronin returns fire, but with arrows and shoots down most of her men, before they are finally able to tase him. It doesn’t last long as he blows up their weapons. Still very much injured the Ronin almost gets blown away by Casey, until she is knocked unconscious by two rival factions and thrown into a deep pit, where cannibals live. She eventually is rescued by the ronin, who moments before, she tried to kill. Strangely, Casey finds herself falling in love with the ronin and even sleeps with him, but she can’t explain why.</p><p>Casey along with the ronin have been mysteriously thrown into feudal Japan, and head for the Aquarius complex on horse. Before they can reach their destination they are stopped by Agat’s slaves. The ronin defeats most of them, but a few try to take Casey has a hostage. Armed with only a sword Casey dispatches them, and is surprised that she can wield a sword. The ronin claims that she is in fact a samurai. Without warning the ronin’s right arm is shot off, and they are once back in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Agat’s slaves are nothing more than robots, powered by Virgo. The Ronin regains his limbs and so does the Feudal Japan illusion. Virgo tells Casey that the ronin is manipulating her mind to see these things, but Casey dismisses her, because she has fallen in love. Casey snaps back into reality after hearing helicopter wings, and tries to escape to the subway, but Virgo blows it up with Casey inside. The ronin telepathically reaches Casey and wakes her from her unconscious state, before Virgo has the chance to kill her. Casey makes her way inside of Aquarius, which has now engulfed much of the city. Virgo taunts Casey as she makes her way to the ronin, but Casey is unaffected. The ronin causes a blackout and Casey finds out from two people in the complex that Peter tried to blow up Virgo, but failed and now is in pretty bad shape.</p><p>Casey finds peter, and he tells her that Virgo must be stopped, and the only way is to “make fantasy fail”. After that Peter is killed by Virgo. Virgo sends more robots to get Casey but before they can hurt her, the ronin blows them up telepathically. Casey continues to the Ronin, when she comes across Peter again, except this time Peter has been deformed by cybernetics. He explains how Virgo wants biocircuitry to be the new dominant life form on earth, and one way she is experimenting is by using Billy. Casey is then forced to kill Peter before he could strangle her.</p><p>Casey finally reaches the ronin, and is transported back into feudal Japan. Agat appears behind her, but there is no time to free the ronin and Casey had to handle the situation. Remembering Peters words of “breaking down fantasy; making fantasy fail” she shoots Agat in the head instead of using her sword. Casey then frees the ronin, but then ridicules him that a she, a woman had to kill Agat and avenge his master. She then gives him a sword in order to commit seppuku- Japanese ritual suicide. Acting as his second Casey then decapitates him, releasing a telekinetic blast that destroys the entire city, and leaving only Casey and the ronin.</p>",

Charlie enjoyed his fame and happily threw himself into the life of a playboy television star. After one particularly grueling night of partying, Charlie was too hung over to show up on set, so his brother Rodger had to go on as his stand in . Unfortunately for Rodger, a group of <a href=\"/weaponers-of-qward/4005-11315/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11315\"> Qwardian Warriors</a> mistook the television Green Lantern for the real thing and attacked. By the time the real Green Lantern arrived, the defenseless stand-in was dead and the Qwardians were gone. Charlie was overcome with grief and blamed himself for his brothers death. He demanded that <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\"> Hal Jordan</a> bring him along in his hunt for the Qwardians, so that Charlie could avenge his brother.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13181/325662-9640-charlie-vicker.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-325662\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.87328767123288\" data-width=\"292\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 292px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13181/325662-9640-charlie-vicker.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-325662\"><img alt=\"Roger's big break\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13181/325662-9640-charlie-vicker.gif\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13181/325662-9640-charlie-vicker.gif 292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px\" data-width=\"292\"></a><figcaption>Roger's big break</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Eventually, the two found the Qwardians and brought their terror to an end. Vicker would eventually acquit himself well enough that the Guardians granted him his own <a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\"> power ring</a>. He was assigned to Sector 3319 where the strange alien inhabitants made Vicker uncomfortable and alone.</p><p> </p><p>Just when he considered resigning from the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\"> Green Lantern Corps</a>, Vicker saved an alien child from death.

    "description": "<p>Carth Onasi, also known as Fleet, was one of the Republics best pilots. He was born on the planet Telos IV in 3994 BBY.</p><p>After the events of the Mandalorian Wars Carth was a Republic pilot who looked up to Admiral Saul Karath. After Darth Malak became lord of the sith Saul Karath defected over to the sith and ordered the bombing of Telos, Carths home planet. Upon hearing the news Carth went to telos where his wife died in his arms and his son Dustil disappeared which caused Carth to never trust anyone again. Eventually Carth found his way to the Endar spire which carried the jedi Bastilla Shan. When the ship was boarded by Sith soldiers Carth remained behind to help any survivors, however there was only one survivor Revan, the pair took the last escape pod and landed on the planet below. After rescuing Bastilla they started looking for a way to get through the sith blockade. Then after Stealing the local crime lords ship the ''Ebon Hawk'' they went to the Jedi Council which sent them on a mission to find the ancient star maps.</p><p> </p><p>Through they're adventures Carth met an old friend who said his son, Dustil was still alive and training to be a sith on Korriban. After going to Korriban he helped Revan get evidence for Dustil to prove the sith were evil, but they were captured by Darth Malak's flagship the ''Leviathan''.</p><p>After escaping the prison, the group ran into Saul Karath and the group fought him. As saul died he told the truth about Revan which made Carth furious, but he eventually forgave him. As on they're way to destroy the Star Forge the ''Ebon Hawk'' was forced down by a disruptor field. While Revan, Juhani and Jolee Bindo set off to destroy the shield. Carth made repairs to the ship. After Revan defeated Darth Malak and the Star forge was destroyed. Carth, Revan and the rest of the group were awarded the Cross of Glory.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>In the years before the universal <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\" href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" slug=\"crisis-on-infinite-earths\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>, Ahtier of Glazzonio, Green Lantern of Sector 83, was fighting a Coltan Raider ship in space, high above the planet Zymia. Athier seriously wounded when the starship self-destructed. The Green Lantern plummeted in a ball of fire to the planet below. Unfortunately for the injured Lantern, Zymia was a planet known for their strong opposition to the Green Lantern Corps. Ahtier's impending death was made more tragic by the fact that she was pregnant. Upon death, a Lantern's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">power ring</a> was programmed to locate a worthy successor. The ring was not programmed to consider the fate of the soon-to-be-born child within Ahtier's womb. The ring coldly informed Athier that the child would have to be sacrificed if her life was to be saved. Athier struggled against the ring's programming, fighting the ring's directive to keep her alive until the child was born. Exhausted and near death, Athier cradled her newborn son as the ring set off to find a worthy replacement.</p><p>A short distance away, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58996\" href=\"/bynari/4005-58996/\" slug=\"bynari\">Bynari</a>, a local Zymian, faced her own tragedy. Bynari's husband Brayle had been killed by the falling debris of the exploding Coltan Raider. Despite her intense grief , Ahtier's ring sensed strength within Bynari and selected her as the Green Lantern's successor. The ring transported Bynari to the dying mother, however, Bynari was horrified by the sight of the Green Lantern, blaming her for her husband's death. Despite Bynari's open contempt, Ahtier knew she was dealing with a woman capable of becoming a Green Lantern. Athier informed the Zymian that she was deemed honest and without fear, and invited to take her place in the Green Lantern Corps. Bynari was even more shocked when the dying Lantern made a more personal request, asking her successor to care for her newborn child. Although still reluctant, Bynari was stirred by this dying request and instructed the ring to recount Ahtier's past. Bynari was flooded with images of a universal force; a force dedicated to preventing others from experiencing tragedies like the one she had just endured. Bynari looked at Athier with a new respect and understanding. She vowed to uphold the tenant of the Corps and protect all life, including her predecessor's newborn baby whom she named Brayle, after her late husband.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Ahtier was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-56264\" href=\"/richard-bruning/4040-56264/\" slug=\"richard-bruning\">Richard Bruning</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5799\" href=\"/kevin-nowlan/4040-5799/\" slug=\"kevin-nowlan\">Kevin Nowlan</a> in a 1987 \"Tales of the Green Lantrern Corps\" short story.</p><h2><b>Character Evolution</b></h2><p>Ahtier appeared years later in a flashback during the Green Lantern's \" <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55677\" href=\"/secret-origin/4045-55677/\" slug=\"secret-origin\">Secret Origin</a>\" story arc. It was revealed that Ahtier received her Corps training in the same class as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\" href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" slug=\"hal-jordan\">Hal Jordan</a>, under the instruction of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46401\" href=\"/kehaan/4005-46401/\" slug=\"kehaan\">Ke'Haan</a> of Varva. Ahtier received praise from Ke'Haan for her skillful ringwork, but the Drill Sargent questioned Ahtier about her shyness. Ahtier confessed her fear over living up to the enormous responsibility entrusted to her by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-universe\">Guardians of the Universe</a>. Ke'Haan responded by pointing out Hal Jordan and assuring her that if a human could do it, so could she. Ahtier's insecurities as a rookie contrasted with how strong and confident she was during her original introduction story, implying that Ahtier had grown into a hero during her years of service in the Corps.</p><p>Years later, Bynari would betray that vow and serve the criminal empire known as the Black Circle when Brayle's life was threatened. Bynari was killed in battle with the Green Lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6954\" href=\"/shilandra-thane/4005-6954/\" slug=\"shilandra-thane\">Shilandra Thane</a>, leaving the fate of Athier's child unknown.</p><p>Ahtier is memorialized in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50762\" href=\"/fallen-lanterns/4060-50762/\" slug=\"fallen-lanterns\">Crypts of Oa</a> alongside other fallen members of the Corps.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Ahtier appeared in a flashback during Hal Jordan's \"Secret Origin\" and as a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50743\" href=\"/black-lantern-corps/4060-50743/\" slug=\"black-lantern-corps\">Black Lantern</a> during the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\" href=\"/blackest-night/4045-55766/\" slug=\"blackest-night\">Blackest Night.</a></p><h2>Powers And Abilities</h2><p>As a member of the Green Lantern Corps, she wields a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">green power ring</a> with all the associated powers and limitations.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Ares Bandet of Xarda served as the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\" href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" slug=\"green-lantern\">Green Lantern</a> of Space Sector 2167. Bandet distinguished himself as a heroic and fearless officer while serving in the war between sound and light. This war was waged on the very fringes of the third dimension. Tales of Ares Bandet’s actions spread throughout the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\" href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" slug=\"green-lantern-corps\">Green Lantern Corps</a> and the brave Lantern was justly recognized by both his fellow Lanterns and the immortal <a data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-universe\">Guardians of the Universe</a>. As recognition for his deeds, the Guardians awarded Ares Bandet the prestigious Emerald of Malthus in a ceremony held on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">Oa</a>. The ceremony was attended by nearly six hundred of Bandet’s fellow Green Lanterns; all on hand to witness the Guardians convey this high honor on one of their own.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ceremony was interrupted by the unexpected arrival of the Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\" href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" slug=\"hal-jordan\">Hal Jordan</a> of Earth. However, this “Hal Jordan”, and his supposed allies from the “ <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">Justice League of America</a>” who accompanied him, were in reality enemies who had taken control of these heroes. The renegade Green Lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10448\" href=\"/sinestro/4005-10448/\" slug=\"sinestro\">Sinestro</a> had assumed Hal Jordan's form as part of a plot to steal the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\" href=\"/central-power-battery/4055-55704/\" slug=\"central-power-battery\">Central Power Battery</a>. Among the “Justice League” were <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19089\" href=\"/doctor-alchemy/4005-19089/\" slug=\"doctor-alchemy\">Mr. Element</a> posing as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\" href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" slug=\"flash\">Flash</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1698\" href=\"/catwoman/4005-1698/\" slug=\"catwoman\">Catwoman</a> in the form of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1689\" href=\"/black-canary/4005-1689/\" slug=\"black-canary\">Black Canary</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3583\" href=\"/dr-light/4005-3583/\" slug=\"dr-light\">Doctor Light</a> disguised as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\" href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" slug=\"martian-manhunter\">Martian Manhunter</a>. The villains were part of a larger scheme by the all powerful being <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55832\" href=\"/agamemno/4005-55832/\" slug=\"agamemno\">Agamemno</a>, who orchestrated the theft on Oa as part of a scheme to gain universal power.</p><p>Mr. Element used the super speed powers of the Flash to strip those Green Lanterns in attendance of their <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">power rings</a>, neutralizing Oa’s warriors. The remaining villains worked to steal the Central Power Battery. By eliminating the Battery, the Lanterns throughout the universe would not be supplied with the energy needed to power their rings, effectively destroying the Green Lanterns Corp.</p><p>What the villains did not know is that Ares Bandet’s species, the Xardans like the Durlans, was gifted with a natural shape shifting ability which allowed him to become invisible while \"the Flash\" struck. Only Ares Bandet was left wielding a ring, and the honored Lantern attacked the villains single-handedly. Ares Bandet attacked bravely despite the odds, however, he was undone by Doctor Light who used the Martian Manhunter’s own shape shifting powers to change his color to yellow.</p><p>Like all Lanterns of that era, Ares Bandet's ring had no power over the color yellow. Before Bandet could switch tactics to overcome this weakness, he was killed by Dr. Light. The distinguished Green Lantern of Xarda fell, while the other \"Justice Leaguers\" took the Central Battery and left Oa.</p><p>The Guardian’s quickly mobilized the remaining Corps. Enraged by the theft of the Central Power Battery and death of such a heroic colleague on their own soil, the remaining Corps confronted the villains in space. Although Agamemno and his nefarious allies were able to overcome the Corps onslaught, the villains were eventually defeated by the Justice League of America and a cadre of heroes of Earth.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Ares Bandet was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40805\" href=\"/mark-millar/4040-40805/\" slug=\"mark-millar\">Mark Millar</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5576\" href=\"/scott-kolins/4040-5576/\" slug=\"scott-kolins\">Scott Kolins</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>There are no known further accounts of Ares Bandet's service in the Corps.</p><p>Ares Bandet was resurrected, along with the other <a href=\"///\">Fallen Lanterns</a> as a member of the <a href=\"///\">Black Lantern Corps</a>. His remains were absorbed into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41919\" href=\"/mogo/4005-41919/\" slug=\"mogo\">Mogo</a> at the conclusion of the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\" href=\"/blackest-night/4045-55766/\" slug=\"blackest-night\">Blackest Night</a>.</p><p>Ares Bandet is memorialized among the honored dead in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50762\" href=\"/fallen-lanterns/4060-50762/\" slug=\"fallen-lanterns\">Crypts of Oa</a>. He is the last known recipient of the Emerald of Malthus.</p><h2>Major Story Arc</h2><p>Ares Bandet only made one appearance. Presumably he was among those Lanterns resurrected during the Blackest Night.</p><h2>Powers And Abilities</h2><p>As a member of the Green Lantern Corps, he wields a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">green power ring</a> with all the associated powers and limitations.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Mr Eff was originally part of a pastry display stand. At some point <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44359\" href=\"/johnny-c/4005-44359/\" slug=\"johnny-c\">Johnny</a> removed him and his \"brother,\" <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71603\" href=\"/psychodoughboy/4005-71603/\" slug=\"psychodoughboy\">Psychodoughboy</a>, from their display and re-painted them. Some time after being brought into the house, Mr Eff became a personification of Johnny's hallucinations. <br/><h2>Creation  </h2>Mr Eff was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-44428\" href=\"/jhonen-vasquez/4040-44428/\" slug=\"jhonen-vasquez\">Jhonen Vasquez</a>. Physically, he is based on the Pillsbury Doughboy.  <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Johnny the Homicidal Maniac </h3>Mr Eff is initially one of the personifications of the voices that guide Johnny. He later comes under the sway of the Wall Monster, and ceases to be a part of Johnny, gaining freedom of thought and the ability to move of his own free will. Mr Eff manifests Johnny's homicidal mania. In opposition to his brother, he struggles to keep Johnny from killing himself, and encourages him to kill people in order to keep the wall painted. It is later revealed that he wants to keep the wall painted in order to keep his master, the Wall Monster, at bay, and force it to give him and his brother more power, due to having developed a desire to maintain a separate identity and become an individual entity in his own right. He works in concert with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71604\" href=\"/nailbunny/4005-71604/\" slug=\"nailbunny\">Nailbunny</a> to thwart his brother and keep Johnny from killing himself, but hates the rabbit as it encourages Johnny to seek help and warns Johnny about the doughboys' alien nature. Because of this, he decapitates the rabbit.",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Description</h2><p>Molly Walker first appeared in \"Don't Look Back\".  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47679\" href=\"/sylar/4005-47679/\" slug=\"sylar\">Sylar</a> had killed her parents, and she was hiding under the stairs.  She was found by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47673\" href=\"/matt-parkman/4005-47673/\" slug=\"matt-parkman\">Matt Parkman</a> who found her using his new found of ability of telepathy.  Next, Sylar tried to kidnap her while she was being kept in a police station.  She was rescued by Matt and Audrey.</p><p>She next appeared in the custody of the Company.  She had been infected with the \"Shanti virus\" but she was cured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47676\" href=\"/mohinder-suresh/4005-47676/\" slug=\"mohinder-suresh\">Mohinder Suresh</a>.  We also dicover in that episode that she has the ability to find anyone, the power of Clairvoyance.<br/></p><p>In the final episode, Molly reveals that she has a \"boogeyman\" who can see her when she looks for people.</p><p>In season 2, Molly and Mohinder is in the care of Mohinder and Matt.  Molly has constant nightmares about the \"boogeyman\" and draws disturbing pictures in school.  When Matt asks her to find his father, she is scared, revealing that he is her \"boogeyman\".  She finds <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48121\" href=\"/maury-parkman/4005-48121/\" slug=\"maury-parkman\">Maury Parkman</a> in Philidelphia, but he sees her, and puts her into a coma.  Mohinder takes her into <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50002\" href=\"/the-company/4060-50002/\" slug=\"the-company\">The Company</a>, where she lays in a coma, until Matt traps his father and escapes with Molly.</p><p>Sylar and Maya then babysit Molly, in an attempt to get him to help them.  Sylar pulls a gun on all of them, and Mohinder takes them all to his new lab, Issac's loft.  Molly offers to find Alejandro for Maya, but she is unable to find him, meaning he's dead.  Luckily, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49564\" href=\"/elle-bishop/4005-49564/\" slug=\"elle-bishop\">Elle Bishop</a> later arrives and attacks Sylar, making him flee.  Mohinder says it was good that Elle turned up, because Sylar probably would have killed them all otherwise.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Powers</h2>Molly describes her power as the ability to \"find people\". By thinking of someone, Molly can psychically determine their exact location fairly quickly and can point out their location on a map. She also receives psychic visions of the person's surroundings. The full extent of her power and what it can locate, beyond people, has not been revealed; Adair Tishler stated in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that Molly's ability is to \"find anyone or anything\".Those with telepathic powers, namely Maury Parkman, can detect and resist her attempts to locate them. Maury, dubbed the \"Nightmare Man\" by Molly because of this, can even affect Molly's mind if she attempts to track him. As seen in \"Powerless\", she can only find people who are alive, as she unsuccessfully tries to find Maya's dead brother.<br/><br/><h2>Alternate Futures</h2> <ul><li>Molly is referenced in the Heroes 360 experience in an email from the future Hiro Nakamura, in which he says he has found Molly Walker and is searching for \"others\" like her.</li><li>In an alternate future of \"Five Years Gone\", Molly is mentioned to be under Mr. Bennet's care. She may have been killed by Sylar since the other people Noah mentioned were.</li><li>In an alternate future of \"I Am Become Death\", Molly is living with Matt and his wife Daphne. She uses her power to locate the younger Peter Petrelli.</li></ul>         ",

Many decades in the past, the ruling scientists of Rhoon had banished the magic users to a tiny island. This exile did not solve the different philosophies pervading through Rhoon culture. One group embraced science as the future of the planet, while the other group sought to advance society through the practice of sorcery. The <a href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\"> Green Lantern</a> Avir appeared to the people of Rhoon as a practitioner of magic. No one knew the truth that Avir’s <a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\"> power ring</a> was actually one of the most sophisticated pieces of scientific engineering in existence, having been created by the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\"> Guardians of the Universe</a>. To avoid the prejudices of her community of sorcerers, Avir disguised the ring as \"green magic\". Avir used her “green magic” to protect both populaces from destroying themselves. Avir led a long and distinguished career among the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\"> Green Lantern Corps</a>. In her later years, Avir came to the rescue of a flaming starship, plummeting from orbit. Avir caught up to the blazing aircraft and rescued a young child from certain death in fiery destruction. The child was unharmed, but her scientist parents were killed in the crash. Avir took the young girl named Hollika Rahn as an apprentice. To protect the child from unjust prejudices Avir hid Holika’s scientific background from the sorcerers on the island. Avir continued her duties as a Green Lantern for many years while raising her adopted daughter. Upon Avir's death, the Guardians approved Hollika Rahn as her successor.</p><p> </p><h2>Blackest Night</h2><p>During the <a href=\"../../the-blackest-night/39-55766/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Blackest Night</a>, Avir along many other fallen Lanterns was raised by a <a href=\"../../black-power-ring/18-55739/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> black power ring</a> and became a <a href=\"../../black-lantern-corps/65-50743/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Black Lantern</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers And Abilities</h2><p>The abilities the ring grants him are:</p><ul><li><b>Animating:</b> A Green Lantern can will things to move how he wants.</li><li><b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> Every ring has a connection to the Main Battery on Oa, which taps into an artificial intelligence. It acts as an \"on-board computer,\" telling the wearer what they need to know. It can either respond out loud, or silently directly to the wearer's mind. The AI contains a large database of information that may be crucial to a Lantern's success. The ring also translates nearly every language to and from the wearer (though they have difficulty translating profanity), which is why the Corps can communicate with each other. When the bearer of a Green Lantern ring dies, the ring will seek out a suitable replacement for their sector. The AI can be used to play a holographic playback sequence complete with colors across the spectrum based on information in memory banks. The ring can dictate when to pause or stop the playback should an interruption arise where the Lanterns undivided attention is needed. The AI can also alert the wielder of incoming threats or of attempts to manipulate the wielders construct by an outside party.</li><li><b>Burglar Alarm:</b> A Green Lantern can coat anything with the ring's beam and thus, if anyone other than himself touches it, his ring will glow, alerting him to the possible theft.</li><li><b>Communicator:</b> The ring can act as a personal communicator between Green Lanterns. They have also been seen connected to telephones.</li><li><b>Costumes:</b> The wearer of the ring may create any costume they choose, based on their personal preferences, whenever they choose. The ring projects the costume over any clothes already worn at the time. The only rules that the Guardians of the Universe implement on the creation of a individual costumed is that the ring bearer display the insignia of the Green Lantern Corps.</li><li><b>Energy Projection:</b> The rings can also project beams, form protective bubbles and force fields, and fire destructive blasts. Sometimes, depending on the wearer, the beams and blasts make sounds. <a href=\"../../kilowog/29-6952/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Kilowog</a>'s ring is one such example of blasts making sounds.</li><li><b>Energy Constructs:</b> The rings can construct anything the wearer can imagine from hard-light energy, as long as they are willing to make it. The more determined the wearer is, the more complex and intricate these things can be. The constructs can even be so complex as to form working machines, computers, and even people.</li><li><b>Flight:</b> The ring allows the wearer to fly in atmosphere or in space, and can achieve incredible speeds, moving from planet to planet in a matter of hours.</li><li><b>Invisibility:</b> The ring can make the wearer or anything else invisible.</li><li><b>Matter Manipulation:</b> A Green Lantern can use their ring to manipulate nearby matter, such as water, for various purposes such as a construct that acts like an energy construct but can block something yellow and may serve a purpose that an energy construct couldn't perform.</li><li><b>Mind Control:</b> The wearer of the Ring can use it to plant post hypnotic commands or control a person.</li><li><b>Mirages:</b> The Ring can create mirages/illusions.</li><li><b>Phasing:</b> The ring allows the user to go through walls. This ability however required great concentration on the bearer of the ring</li><li><b>Power Absorbing:</b> In the JLA's first fight with <a href=\"../../amazo/29-3737/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Amazo</a>, it was GL who defeated him by drawing out all of Amazo's powers. In Green Lantern/ <a href=\"../../silver-surfer/29-2502/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Silver Surfer</a>: Unholy Alliances, Kyle defeated Parallax with SS' power and <a href=\"../../thanos/29-7607/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Thanos</a> with Oa's energy by drawing out all that extra energy from them which made them unconscious. However he couldn't hold all that power nor could his Ring like Hal did with Amazo's powers, so that move isn't often used with so much power.</li><li><b>Probing:</b> The ring can probe the Lantern's or another person's mind, allowing him to uncover memories or the person's thoughts. <b>(An ability which has not been seen for some time)</b></li><li><b>Recharging:</b> The rings need to be recharged by means of a <a href=\"../../power-battery/12-42357/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Power Battery</a>. Other large sources of power may be used to recharge a power ring, however effectiveness may vary. The internal power source of a <a href=\"../../manhunter-android/29-11316/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Manhunter Android</a> is, in effect, the same as a power battery, and can be used to recharge a power ring. During the <a href=\"../../jla-avengers/49-10941/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> JLA / Avengers</a> crossover, a <a href=\"../../cosmic-cube/18-40949/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Cosmic Cube</a>was used to recharge a depleted ring, although this is not an ideal solution and is available if there are no other options.</li><li><b>Ring Duplication:</b> Each ring can duplicate itself, creating a second ring which may be given to another as a backup, for protection, or to help the lantern in times of great need. This duplicate ring is exactly like a normal ring.</li><li><b>Temperature Control:</b> The Ring can increase or decrease the temperature of anything, even something as large as stars, or even create bubbles of intense heat or cold, even down to Absolute Zero. This could be seen in the recent Sinestro Corps War when Sallak used his ring to encase an enemy in a force bubble an incinerate him.</li><li><b>Transforming (former):</b> The ring can transform anyone or anything, be it into an animal, altering their state of appearance, or their size. Once Hal and Alan turned the two Flashes ( <a href=\"../../barry-allen/29-22804/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Barry</a> and <a href=\"../../jay-garrick/29-2395/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Jay</a>) to light protons in order to free them from prisons.</li><li><b>Electro-magnetic scanning:</b> The ring can allow(through the use of x rays) the user to see through walls, without the people on the other side knowing. it can also scan along the Electromagnetic spectrum.</li><li><b>Wormhole/Warps:</b> The ring can open wormholes to cut down on distance.</li><li><b>Healing:</b> A wielder can command a ring to heal him/her/itself of any injures incurred. It can also heal others. This ability however cannot regenerate lost limbs.</li><li><b>Energy twin:</b> The ring can create an energy copy of the wielder which is connected to the ring wielder, any information the twin gathers is transferred to the wielder upon touch while others cannot see this twin apart from fellow Green Lanterns. <b>(An ability which has not been seen for some time)</b></li><li><b>Pocket dimension</b>: Within the ring is a pocket dimension which can altered to the wielders specification. It can be used to contain opponents.</li><li><b>Sub-routines:</b> The power rings have inner programmings or mechanisms which can executed without the users permission. One such sub-routine is the autoshield. This shield automatically protects a wielder from external harm and has been proven to be capable of protecting the wielder from planetary level attacks.</li></ul><p> </p><h2><b>Retconned</b></h2><p><b>Radiation:</b> Besides light based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Green <a href=\"../../kryptonite/18-32213/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Kryptonite</a>, a form of radiation that is harmful to <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Superman</a>. However, this ability is no longer valid and has been retconned.</p><p><b>Time travel:</b> The ring allows the wielder the ability to travel through time, though the process requires great willpower.</p><p> </p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p><b>Mental Incapacitation</b>: The ring cannot be wielded correctly if the wearer is under the influence of drugs or if there is an involvement of neural interference.</p><p> </p><p><b>Yellow Impurity:</b> In the beginning the Green Ring was vulnerable to the color yellow. It was unable to defend against attacks from wielders of the Sinestro Corps as well. This weakness however has now be changed and can be overcome by veterans who have the ability to overcome great fear. Hal Jordan was of the first of the Green Lanterns to show that this weakness could be overcome.</p><p> </p><p><b>Recharge</b>: Previously had to be recharged every 24 hours or when it has been depleted of energy. This can be accomplished if the bearer of the ring recites an oath into his power lantern while holding the ring to it. However now, the power ring only needs to be recharged when it runs out of energy. Sinestro stated to Hal that it was possible for a Green Lantern to store his.her battery in a pocket Universe and take it with them wherever they went but so far Hal has not displayed the ability to do this.</p><p> </p><p><b>Red Lantern Corps</b>. Bearers of the red ring have the ability to drain a Green Power Ring of its energy. The ring of a Blue Lantern however has the ability to charge a Green Lantern Ring or negate this negative effect. Blue Lanterns rings also have the ability to purge the negative effects that a Red Lanterns Ring can cause upon the wielder of a Green Lantern Ring.</p><p> </p><p><b>(Previous Weaknesses)</b></p><p> </p><p><b>Ability To Kill</b>: One of the main weaknesses of the Power Rings that greatly disturbed Sinestro was the fact that the bearers of the Green Lantern Ring were unable to kill. Recently however, this restriction on the rings has been lifted but murder is still against the law of the GL Corps<b>.</b> This restriction was lifted by the Guardians of the Universe during the War of the Green Lanterns.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79038/1738027-avir_bl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738027\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5584415584416\" data-width=\"77\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 77px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79038/1738027-avir_bl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738027\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79038/1738027-avir_bl.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79038/1738027-avir_bl.jpg 77w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 77px) 100vw, 77px\" data-width=\"77\"></a></figure>",

    "description": "<p> <b>Green Lantern (Renegade)<br/>Status: Deceased<br/>Space Sector: 3112<br/>Sector Partner: Service pre-dates Sector Partners<br/>Homeworld: </b> <b>Aegri Somnia One</b><br/> <b>Predecessor: Unknown <br/>Successor: Unknown <br/></b></p> <h2><br/>BIOGRAPHY:</h2><p>Ayria was the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\" href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" slug=\"green-lantern\">  Green Lantern</a> of Aegri Somnia One located in Space Sector 3112.  The three worlds of the Aegri Somnia system were in a continuous state of war.  Ayria believed that the only way of bringing order to his system was to rule it by force.  The second planet in the Aegri system, AS2, immediately complied with Ayria's requests, as they viewed him as a god.  However, the third planet, AS3, opposed the Green Lantern's tyranny and began painting their ships yellow to combat Ayria.  When Ayria's top general, his brother, expressed his staff's worries, Ayria had the general staff executed as a message to his other followers.  The Lantern was winning the war on AS3, thanks to Ayria's strategies.  Ayria gradually became a monster, he poisoned the planet by creating weapons factories and drove the population into concentration camps. Their wills were torn from them to feed Ayria's power battery, and set up concentration camps of his oppressed people. Most villainous, Ayria demanded a steady stream of women brought to him from the slave pits, to satisfy his desires.  <br/><br/>Still, resistance was growing on AS3.  What Ayria did not realize is that the slave girl Selaya was secretly a member of the AS3 resistance.  One evening, while Ayria slept, she snuck into his room and stole his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">  power ring</a>.  Ayria was furious and ordered mass executions.  Selaya died with the ring on her person and was thrown into a mass grave.  Ayria never gave up his search for his ring.  As he walked through the fields of the dead, his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55747\" href=\"/power-battery/4055-55747/\" slug=\"power-battery\">  power battery</a> came into contact with Selaya and the ring.  With the battery overcharged with the combined willpower of thousands of Ayria's victims, the emerald energy was released in a wave and reanimated the thousands of corpses within Ayria's mass grave.  A reanimated Selaya led the living dead in their final revolt and dragged Ayria down.  The tyrant was ripped apart by the zombies.

    "description": "<p><b>Green Lantern</b></p><p><b>Status: Deceased</b></p><p><b>Space Sector: 312</b></p><p><b>Sector Partner: Service pre-dates Sector Partners</b></p><p><b>Homeworld:</b> <b>Suirpalam</b></p><p><b>Predecessor: Unknown</b></p><p><b>Successor: Unknown</b></p><h2>BIOGRAPHY:</h2><p>Approximately three billion years ago, B'shi was living a peaceful life on the jungle world of Suirpalam when a stranger from the stars came to offer her great power. He was known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22636\" href=\"/raker-qarrigat/4005-22636/\" slug=\"raker-qarrigat\">Raker Qarrigat</a>, a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\" href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" slug=\"green-lantern-corps\">Green Lantern Corps</a>. The Corps' masters, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-universe\">Guardians of the Universe</a>, were expanding the number of ring wielders in preparation for an invasion of the dark world known as <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\" href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" slug=\"apokolips\">Apokolips</a>. She would travel to the homeworld of the Corps, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">Oa</a>, where she was trained in the use of the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">power ring</a>. Like Raker Qarrigat before her, B'shi was also sent out to recruit other <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\" href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" slug=\"green-lantern\">Green Lanterns</a>. From the Perreseen debris field, B'shi brought the rock creature <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49695\" href=\"/ash-pak-glif/4005-49695/\" slug=\"ash-pak-glif\">Ash-Pak-Glif</a> into the Corps.</p><p>When the Corps had become 3600 strong, they were sent against Apokolips, only to find their invasion had been expected. Hordes of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9998\" href=\"/parademons/4005-9998/\" slug=\"parademons\">Parademons</a> wore yellow armor which exploited the weakness of the power ring. Fully two-thirds of the Green Lanterns were slaughtered or, like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50765\" href=\"/alisandr/4005-50765/\" slug=\"alisandr\">Alisand'r</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56012\" href=\"/tamaran/4020-56012/\" slug=\"tamaran\">Tamaran</a>, taken prisoner in the ensuing battle. The Green Lanterns also found the energy from the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\" href=\"/central-power-battery/4055-55704/\" slug=\"central-power-battery\">Central Power Battery</a> of Oa was strained and diminished in crossing the barrier between the universe of the Guardians and that of Apokolips.</p><p>B'shi was one of thousands of Green Lanterns to fall before the forces of Apokolips. Numerous Green Lanterns were tortured, their bodies left as warnings to those who might oppose <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\" href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" slug=\"darkseid\">Darkseid</a>'s rule. The Guardians of the Universe ultimately called for a truce with Darkseid. They recalled the Corps, leaving Raker Qarrigat behind as Darkseid's spoils of war. It is not known if the remains of B'shi and other Green Lanterns were returned to Oa for internment in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50762\" href=\"/fallen-lanterns/4060-50762/\" slug=\"fallen-lanterns\">Crypts of Oa</a>. By the Guardians' command, the record of the battle was expunged from the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56006\" href=\"/the-book-of-oa/4055-56006/\" slug=\"the-book-of-oa\">Great Book of Oa</a>.</p><p><i>**in the issue which featured this tale, Ash Pak Glif is noted as hailing from Sector 312. however, in a recent splash page depicting the Fallen Lanterns, B'shi is listed as protector of Sector 312 as well. Whether this is correct or a mistake remains to be seen.**</i></p>",

It was on a border world in his sector that Barin Char met his gruesome fate.</p><p>In an isolated area of the planet, a previously unknown alien species had set up a hive within a rock formation. The Green Lantern was investigating the aliens which would, if left unchecked, pose a threat to the population of the planet. Somehow, Barin Char was separated from his</p><p><a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\"> power ring</a></p><p>and at some point, either before or after, was attacked by a \"face hugger,\" a creature which hatched out of the aliens' egg and would forcibly plant an alien within a victim. Barin Char was then partially cocooned in the hive while a new alien gestated inside him. When it was ready, the alien violently burst free from Barin Char's body, killing the Green Lantern.</p><p>The</p><p><a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\"> Guardians of the Universe</a></p><p>dispatched six veteran Green Lanterns to discover what had happened to their fellow ring wielder.

    "description": "<p> <b>Green Lantern<br/>Status: Deceased<br/>Space Sector: 3391<br/>Sector Partner: Service pre-dated Sector Partners<br/>Homeworld: </b> <b>Unknown</b><br/> <b>Predecessor: Unknown<br/>Successor: Unknown <br/></b></p> <h2>BIOGRAPHY:</h2><p>Bivvix was abducted by the Draal, an alien race that was replacing <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\" href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" slug=\"green-lantern\">     Green Lanterns</a> with sleeper agents. The Draal would take the Green Lanterns' <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">     power rings</a>, and clone them. A creature called a xanoglyph would be used to probe the Green Lantern's mind, transferring the thoughts and memories to the clone. The clone would then go back to the Green Lantern's sector. When the Draal were ready, they would strike on many worlds at one time. It is possible the Draal kept the Green Lanterns in case of any unforeseen needs.</p><p>The Green Lanterns had given up hope of escape until they were joined by ex-Green Lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\" href=\"/guy-gardner/4005-1791/\" slug=\"guy-gardner\">     Guy Gardner</a>, who had just been captured by the Draal. Shortly, Gardner had devised a plan of escape. Working with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49748\" href=\"/gpaak/4005-49748/\" slug=\"gpaak\">     Gpaak</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46405\" href=\"/graf-toren/4005-46405/\" slug=\"graf-toren\">     Graf Toren</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6955\" href=\"/voz/4005-6955/\" slug=\"voz\">     Voz</a>, they had to forcibly convince <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49693\" href=\"/rru-9-2/4005-49693/\" slug=\"rru-9-2\">     RRU-9-2</a> of the viability of their plan.</p><p>Using the battery cell of the robotic RRU-9-2, the gelatinous Gpaak carried the terminal to the high density neuron force field holding them in their cell. Gpaak was blasted into globules, but was able to reconstitute himself. Together with Gardner, the Green Lanterns were able to take control of the Draal ship. Following his request, the Green Lanterns left Guy Gardner on Earth to fight his clone.</p><p>Alongside the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">     Justice League America</a>, Guy hammered away at his clone before triangulating the clone's location for transport. The clone was brought aboard the former Draal ship and stripped of its <a data-ref-id=\"4055-53415\" href=\"/sinestro-corps-ring/4055-53415/\" slug=\"sinestro-corps-ring\">     yellow power ring</a>. The Qwardian ring was then sent to its rightful owner. The Green Lanterns headed out to get their power rings back from their own replicas.</p><p>Some time later, Graf Toren and many other Green Lanterns went to stop <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\" href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" slug=\"hal-jordan\">     Hal Jordan</a> from reaching <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">     Oa</a>. They failed and power rings across the universe disintegrated. Bivvix was forced to take a starship to Earth to warn Guy Gardner. Unfortunately, the strain was too much for the ship, and it was destroyed before entering the atmosphere. </p><p>Bivvix attempted to escape by using an EVA suit, however, the generating coils on the field life support unit failed. He was burned up in atmospheric reentry. His remains were eventually brought back to the Crypts of Oa. <br/></p><h2>Blackest Night</h2>Bivvix was resurrected, along with the other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50762\" href=\"/fallen-lanterns/4060-50762/\" slug=\"fallen-lanterns\">  Fallen Lanterns</a>, as a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50743\" href=\"/black-lantern-corps/4060-50743/\" slug=\"black-lantern-corps\"> Black Lantern Corps</a>.

Computerized drones of the <a href=\"/spider-guild/4060-55986/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55986\"> Spider Guild</a> had attacked a solar system of a nearby star. When Brin could not turn the Guild ships away, he foolishly rushed to attack and barely escaped with his life. He appealed to the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\"> Guardians of the Universe</a> for other members of the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\"> Green Lantern Corps</a> to join the effort, including <a href=\"/green-man/4005-47281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47281\"> Green Man</a>. The Corps repelled the invasion. On Oa, the Guardians decided to retire Brin from the Corps. </p><p>When he retired, it was assumed one of his children, Meri, Cor, or even his now infant son would take on the responsibilities of Green Lantern. In the years of his service, the family had a robotic <a href=\"/t-cher/4005-49727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49727\"> T-Cher</a> to help his wife Mina raise their two children. T-Cher had trained the boys well, just as he had trained Brin. Brin returned home, and told his family the news. The Guardians had chosen someone from Brin's family to be his successor. The Guardians pointed to the one they had chosen. It was not Meri or Cor or the infant, but T-Cher. The Guardians had watched him for many years, his courage and wisdom had protected and guided the family. He was considered the most worthy for the Corps. Meri and Cor had reacted to the news with anger. Though T-Cher had wanted to explain to the kids, Brin told him he had a greater responsibility. Now it was time for Brin to raise his children.</p><p>Through circumstances yet unrevealed, Brin has been reported as deceased and is memorialized in the Crypts of Oa.</p><h2>Blackest Night</h2><p>Brin was resurrected, along with the other <a href=\"/fallen-lanterns/4060-50762/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50762\"> Fallen Lanterns</a>, as a member of the <a href=\"/black-lantern-corps/4060-50743/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50743\"> Black Lantern Corps</a>. His current whereabouts are unknown.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79038/1739696-brin_bl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739696\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6973684210526\" data-width=\"76\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 76px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:169.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79038/1739696-brin_bl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739696\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79038/1739696-brin_bl.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79038/1739696-brin_bl.jpg 76w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 76px) 100vw, 76px\" data-width=\"76\"></a></figure>",

More recently, another kinsmen serving in the Corps was killed in horrific fashion when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\" href=\"/superman-prime/4005-40756/\" slug=\"superman-prime\">Superman Prime</a> froze and shattered his body.  Cundiff  Cood was soon to follow his fallen brethren. <br/><br/>Cundiff was still a rookie <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\" href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" slug=\"green-lantern\">Green Lantern</a> when the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42352\" href=\"/sinestro-corps/4060-42352/\" slug=\"sinestro-corps\">Sinestro Corps</a> attacked <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">Oa</a> as part of the abduction of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\" href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" slug=\"kyle-rayner\">Kyle Rayner</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55697\" href=\"/ion/4015-55697/\" slug=\"ion\">Ion entity</a>.  Cundiff followed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\" href=\"/guy-gardner/4005-1791/\" slug=\"guy-gardner\">Guy Gardner</a> and a group of Lanterns outside of Oa's protection</b>  , as they chased the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-53415\" href=\"/sinestro-corps-ring/4055-53415/\" slug=\"sinestro-corps-ring\">Sinestro Corps ring</a>  that teleported Rayner from Oa  .  When the ring escaped to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41619\" href=\"/qward/4020-41619/\" slug=\"qward\">Qward</a> , Cundiff questioned Gardner about   the anti-matter universe, having been unaware of it's existence.    Cundiff was amazed by Gardner's answer and remarked how he always learns something new on Oa.  Before he could complete his thought, Cundiff was shot through the eye and killed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45574\" href=\"/bedovian/4005-45574/\" slug=\"bedovian\">Bedovian</a> , the Sinestro Corps sniper.  Cundiff's head exploded, as Gardner screamed a warning to his fellow Lanterns.  Seconds later, the Sinestro Corps attacked Oa killing many Green Lanterns in the first major battle of the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-50650\" href=\"/sinestro-corps-war/4045-50650/\" slug=\"sinestro-corps-war\">Sinestro Corps War</a> .<br/><br/>Cundiff Cood is memorialized in the Crypts of Oa alongside his fellow <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50762\" href=\"/fallen-lanterns/4060-50762/\" slug=\"fallen-lanterns\">Fallen Lanterns</a> .<b> <br/></b><br/> <h2>Powers and Abilities<br/></h2><b>Cundiff Cood is the wielder of a Green Lantern Power Ring which enables him to accomplish a variety of effects. The Green Lantern Ring allows Cundiff Cood to manipulate its energies through the use of willpower.</b><br/><b> </b><br/><b>The Green Lantern Ring gives Cundiff Cood the following abilities:</b><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Animating:</b> A Green Lantern can will things to move how he wants.</li><li><b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> Every ring has a connection to the Main Battery on Oa, which taps into an artificial intelligence. It acts as an \"on-board computer,\" telling the wearer what they need to know. It can either respond out loud, or silently directly to the wearer's mind. The AI contains a large database of information that may be crucial to a Lantern's success. The ring also translates nearly every language to and from the wearer (though they have difficulty translating profanity), which is why the Corps can communicate with each other. When the bearer of a Green Lantern ring dies, the ring will seek out a suitable replacement for their sector. The AI can be used to play a holographic playback sequence complete with colors across the spectrum based on information in memory banks. The ring can dictate when to pause or stop the playback should an interruption arise where the Lanterns undivided attention is needed. The AI can also alert the wielder of incoming threats or of attempts to manipulate the wielders construct by an outside party.</li><li><b>Burglar Alarm:</b> A Green Lantern can coat anything with the ring's beam and thus, if anyone other than himself touches it, his ring will glow, alerting him to the possible theft.</li><li><b>Communicator: </b>The ring can act as a personal communicator between Green Lanterns. They have also been seen connected to telephones.</li><li><b>Costumes:</b> The wearer of the ring may create any costume they choose, based on their personal preferences, whenever they choose. The ring projects the costume over any clothes already worn at the time.</li><li><b>Energy Projection:</b> The rings can also project beams, form protective bubbles and force fields, and fire destructive blasts. Sometimes, depending on the wearer, the beams and blasts make sounds. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6952\" href=\"/kilowog/4005-6952/\" slug=\"kilowog\">Kilowog</a>'s ring is one such example of blasts making sounds.</li><li><b>Energy Constructs:</b> The rings can construct anything the wearer can imagine from hard-light energy, as long as they are willing to make it. The more determined the wearer is, the more complex and intricate these things can be. The constructs can even be so complex as to form working machines, computers, and even people.</li><li><b>Flight: </b>The ring allows the wearer to fly in atmosphere or in space, and can achieve incredible speeds, moving from planet to planet in a matter of hours.</li><li><b>Invisibility: </b>The ring can make the wearer or anything else invisible.</li><li><b>Matter Manipulation: </b>A Green Lantern can use their ring to manipulate nearby matter, such as water, for various purposes such as a construct that acts like an energy construct but can block something yellow and may serve a purpose that an energy construct couldn't perform.</li><li><b>Mind Control: </b>The wearer of the Ring can use it to plant post hypnotic commands or control a person.</li><li><b>Mirages: </b>The Ring can create mirages/illusions.</li><li><b>Phasing: </b>The ring allows the user to go through walls.</li><li><b>Power Absorbing:</b> In the JLA's first fight with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3737\" href=\"/amazo/4005-3737/\" slug=\"amazo\">Amazo</a>, it was GL who defeated him by drawing out all of Amazo's powers. In Green Lantern/<a data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\" href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" slug=\"silver-surfer\"> Silver Surfer</a>: Unholy Alliances, Kyle defeated Parallax with SS' power and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\" href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" slug=\"thanos\">Thanos </a>with Oa's energy by drawing out all that extra energy from them which made them unconscious. However he couldn't hold all that power nor could his Ring like Hal did with Amazo's powers, so that move isn't often used with so much power.</li><li><b>Probing: </b>The ring can probe the Lantern's or another person's mind, allowing him to uncover memories or the person's thoughts.</li><li><b>Radiation:</b> Besides light based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Green <a data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\" href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" slug=\"kryptonite\">Kryptonite</a>, a form of radiation that is harmful to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a>. However, this ability is no longer valid and has been retconned. <br/></li><li><b>Recharging:</b> The rings need to be recharged by means of a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42357\" href=\"/power-battery/4015-42357/\" slug=\"power-battery\">Power Battery</a>. Other large sources of power may be used to recharge a power ring, however effectiveness may vary. The internal power source of a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11316\" href=\"/manhunter-android/4005-11316/\" slug=\"manhunter-android\">Manhunter Android</a> is, in effect, the same as a power battery, and can be used to recharge a power ring. During the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-10941\" href=\"/jla-avengers/4050-10941/\" slug=\"jla-avengers\">JLA / Avengers</a> crossover, a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\" href=\"/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/\" slug=\"cosmic-cube\">Cosmic Cube</a>was used to recharge a depleted ring, although this is not an ideal solution and is available if there are no other options.</li><li><b>Ring Duplication:</b> Each ring can duplicate itself, creating a second ring which may be given to another as a backup, for protection, or to help the lantern in times of great need. This duplicate ring is exactly like a normal ring.</li><li><b>Temperature Control:</b> The Ring can increase or decrease the temperature of anything, even something as large as stars, or even create bubbles of intense heat or cold, even down to Absolute Zero.</li><li><b>Transforming:</b> The ring can transform anyone or anything, be it into an animal, altering their state of appearance, or their size. Once Hal and Alan turned the two Flashes (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\" href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" slug=\"barry-allen\"> Barry </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2395\" href=\"/jay-garrick/4005-2395/\" slug=\"jay-garrick\">Jay</a>) to light protons in order to free them from prisons.</li><li><b>Electro-magnetic scanning:</b> The ring can allow(through the use of x rays) the user to see through walls, without the people on the other side knowing. it can also scan along the Electromagnetic spectrum.</li><li><b>Wormhole/Warps:</b> The ring can open wormholes to cut down on distance.</li><li><b>Time travel:</b> The ring allows the wielder the ability to travel through time, though the process requires great willpower.</li><li><b>Healing:</b> A wielder can command a ring to heal him/her/itself of any injures incurred. It can also heal others.</li><li><b>Energy twin:</b> The ring can create an energy copy of the wielder which is connected to the ring wielder, any information the twin gathers is transferred to the wielder upon touch while others cannot see this twin apart from fellow Green Lanterns.</li><li><b>Pocket dimension</b>: Within the ring is a pocket dimension which can altered to the wielders specification. It can be used to contain opponents.</li><li><b>Sub-routines:</b> The power rings have inner programmings or mechanisms which can executed without the users permission. One such sub-routine is the autoshield. This shield automatically protects a wielder from external harm and has been proven to be capable of protecting the wielder from planetary level attacks.          </li></ul><h2>Weaknesses</h2><b>Mental Incapacitation</b>: The ring cannot be wielded correctly if the wearer is under the influence of drugs or if there is an involvement of neural interference.<br/><br/><b>Yellow Impurity:</b> In the beginning the Green Ring was vulnerable to the color yellow. It was unable to defend against attacks from wielders of the Sinestro Corps as well. This weakness however has now be changed and can be overcome by veterans who have the ability to overcome great fear. Hal Jordan was of the first of the Green Lanterns to show that this weakness could be overcome.<br/><br/><b>Recharge</b>: Previously had to be recharged every 24 hours or when it has been depleted of energy. This can be accomplished if the bearer of the ring recites an oath into his power lantern while holding the ring to it. However now, the power ring only needs to be recharged when it runs out of energy. Sinestro stated to Hal that it was possible for a Green Lantern to store his.her battery in a pocket Universe and take it with them wherever they went but so far Hal has not displayed the ability to do this.<br/><br/><b>Red Lantern Corps</b>. Bearers of the red ring have the ability to drain a Green Power Ring of its energy. The ring of a Blue Lantern however has the ability to charge a Green Lantern Ring or negate this negative effect. Blue Lanterns rings also have the ability to purge the negative effects that a Red Lanterns Ring can cause upon the wielder of a Green Lantern Ring.<br/><b><br/></b><b>(Previous Weaknesses)</b><br/><b>Ability To Kill</b>: One of the main weaknesses of the Power Rings that greatly disturbed Sinestro was the fact that the bearers of the Green Lantern Ring were unable to kill. Recently however, this restriction on the rings has been lifted but murder is still against the law of the GL Corps<b>. </b>This restriction was lifted by the Guardians of the Universe during the War of the Green Lanterns.",

Canar was grateful for the offer, but given that he already posessed super-strength and invulnerability, he felt that Fulvian would be better served by the Corps inducting another hero. Thus, the honor fell to Dob Zagil, a teacher, who readily accepted the challenge of becoming a Green Lantern. Zagil was trained by the alien Lantern, and entrusted to protect Fluvian from all manners of crime and disaster as the Green Lantern of Space Sector 1582. </p> <p>Dob Zagil threw himself into his work as Fluvian's protector, but he soon discovered that even a Green Lantern could not prevent all crime. It seemed to Zagil that for every crime he stopped, another took place while his back was turned or his attention diverted elsewhere. Zagil grew frustrated over his failure to stop all crime on Fluvian, and gradually began to view the poor O'Fal as the main culprets for Fluvian's ills.</p> <p>Dob Zagil came to believe that most crimes were being committed by the less fortunate O'Lav species against the wealthy E'Fal. Zagil theorized that the best defense against crime would be to bring the fight directly to the criminals, namely in the O'Lav neighborhoods. Zagil launched a campaign against the O'Lav, attacking and terrorizing innocent O'Lavians in a misguided attempt to make them so frightened of the Green Lantern that they wouldn't dare commit another crime against the E'Fal. Zagil's tactics appeared to work, the O'Lav were terrified of the Green Lantern and crime dropped significantly. The E'Fal were elated over their protector's persecution of the wretched O'Lav and unconcerned that Zagil terrorized their less fortunate neighbors indiscriminately, rageardless of their guilt or innocence. </p> <p>All the while, Lin Canar took advantage of the Green Lantern's arrival to devote himself to his scientific studies. Holed up in his lab, Canar was unaware of Zagil's abuse of power for some time. When he finally left the lab, Canar was shocked to discover the Green Lantern's extreme approach to law enforcement and the persecution the O'Lav were enduring. Canar confronted Fluvian's newest hero, and the debate quickly lead to blows.  Despite his super strength, Lin Canar was not equal to the Lantern's power ring and fled. As Zagil slipped further into madness; he took off in pursuit, intent on destroying his rival. However, Canar did not flee without a plan. He led the Green Lantern back to his lab, and tricked Dob Zagil into destroying the equipment that had once exploded accidentally, giving Canar his super strength.  Zagil fell for his plan and fired a blast that caused the labratory to explode in a wave of strange energy. Both men were knocked out, the energy stealing Canar's super strength from him. </p> <p>Lin Canar was the first to recover and swam over to Zagil's body, taking the power ring. Zagil had proven himself unworthy of the Corps. With his super strength gone, Canar decided to accept the alien Lantern's offer to join the Corps and placed Zagil's ring on his finger. Canar resolved to prove to Fluvian that it's two species could co-exist without resorting to violence, crime, or persecution.</p> <p>Dob Zagil allowed the power of the Green Lantern to corrupt him, however he was more misguided than evil and stands recognized among his fellow <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50762\" href=\"/fallen-lanterns/4060-50762/\" slug=\"fallen-lanterns\">Fallen Lanterns</a> in the Crypts of Oa. </p>",

He was killed by <a href=\"/sinestro/4005-10448/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10448\"> Sinestro</a> and the <a href=\"/tdhd/4005-89060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89060\">Mad Sector 3600</a>, however an apparent error in his ring kept Driq in a zombie-like state of near death for some time. Driq would aid in<a href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\"> John Stewart</a> and <a href=\"/katma-tui/4005-10445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10445\"> Katma Tui's</a> capture of Sinestro and destruction of the Mad Sector. When the <a href=\"/central-power-battery/4055-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\"> Central Power Battery</a> was destroyed, so to was the power which maintained Driq's reanimated state. He collapsed when the last of his ring's power dissipated, and was finally at peace.</p><p> </p><p>Driq was among the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fallen-lanterns/4015-56265/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56265\">Fallen Lanterns</a> who were resurrected by the <a href=\"/black-lantern-corps/4060-50743/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50743\"> Black Lantern Corps</a>. Unlike other Black Lanterns, his chest emblem displays a half Green Lantern / half Black Lantern logo, in reference to his death-like state. On the Black Lantern planet of <a href=\"/xanshi/4020-56616/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56616\"> Xanshi</a>, Driq lured John Stewart to the planet with his old power battery. When Stewart arrived at Xanshi, he was assaulted by Black Lanterns of the people killed when Xanshi was destroyed. Stewart attempted to destroy the Black Lanterns by detonating Driq's battery, but was unsuccessful and was subsequently assaulted by the Black Lantern of Katma Tui.</p><p> </p><p>Stewart later lead an assault of various Lantern Corps to Xanshi. While there, Driq, now speaking through his Green Lantern ring free of the control of the Black Lantern Ring, told Stewart how to destroy the Black Lantern planet, and went as far as to accompany the Corps to Xanshi's Corps. Along with all the other Black Lanterns, he returned to death after the defeat of the Corps.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A veteran of the Vietnam war ,Bobby became homeless after his return to the United States. It was many years later that he met and befriended <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3381\" href=\"/spawn/4005-3381/\">Spawn</a>, the current <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49039\" href=\"/hellspawn/4060-49039/\">Hellspawn</a>. Unfortunately his friendship with Spawn would indirectly caused his death. Soon after Spawn had attacked and branded <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5188\" href=\"/chapel/4005-5188/\">Chapel</a> he sought revenge and killed Bobby in a fight against Spawn. He then committed suicide in an attempt to receive the same powers as Spawn. Spawn however used a vast portion of his powers to revive body but all the while bringing him closer to his own \"death\". After being resurrected Bobby was kidnapped when the second <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3383\" href=\"/redeemer/4005-3383/\">Redeemer</a> was sent to capture him. As soon as Redeemer found him he began to study him keeping him in a field of energy covering him with a sticky yellow material. When Spawn tried to save him he was knocked out and Redeemer teleported away with Bobby in tow. After Spawn recovered his suit went through it's first metamorphoses. With his new found suit he attacked Heaven's Terran Base in an attempt to save Bobby. When Spawn forced them to send down Bobby he battled Redeemer and the forces of heaven eventually being forced to escape by teleportation and sent Bobby and himself back to the alleys. </p><p>After Spawn had forced everyone to leave the alleys of rat city in later events, Bobby disappeared and hasn't been heard from since.</p>",

    "deck": "Tahu was one of six great protectors of the island of Mata Nui before the island and being's destruction. He is considered the spirit of fire. He is one of the six made to protect Mata Nui (the being).",
    "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tahu fell from the sky into the sea in a capsule with five other beings known to the people as <a href=\"/toa/4060-55459/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55459\">Toa</a>. Originally the capsules were intended to shoot into the space past the planet, but they instead fell into the sea. It would become their mission to free the island of Mata Nui, where they washed up, from the grasp of the evil <a href=\"/teridax/4005-55448/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55448\">Makuta</a> and to save Mata Nui, the being for which the island was named, from his Makuta-induced sleep. The Turaga of Fire, <a href=\"/vakama/4005-70080/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70080\">Vakama</a>, one of the leaders of the Matoran, mentored him in his missions.</p><h2>Story </h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tahu was a member of the <a href=\"/toa-mata/4060-51460/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51460\">Toa Mata</a> team, originally thought to be the first Toa team, whose members included <a href=\"/gali/4005-51243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51243\">Gali</a>, <a href=\"/pohatu/4005-51385/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51385\">Pohatu</a>, <a href=\"/onua/4005-51431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51431\">Onua</a>, <a href=\"/kopaka/4005-51054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51054\">Kopaka</a>, and <a href=\"/lewa/4005-51113/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51113\">Lewa</a>. They arrived on Mata Nui unaware of who they were. They found villages of beings called Matoran who had awaited their arrival to free them from the tyranny of the Makuta. The Matoran were led by wise beings called the Turaga who knew the Toa's names and purpose. It was their destiny to find all of the great Kanohi masks and use them to defeat Makuta who had polluted the minds of the animals of Mata Nui, known as <a href=\"/rahi/4060-57407/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57407\">Rahi</a>, and put the Great Spirit Mata Nui to sleep. Tahu became the leader of the team, with <a href=\"/kopaka/4005-51054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51054\">Kopaka</a> acting as the deputy.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In their first few journeys on the island, Tahu gained five other masks aside Tahu and his new Golden Mask from his Hau Mask of Shielding. The new masks gave him the powers of underwater breathing, x-ray vision, super speed, super strength, and levitation. At the temple of Kini Nui the six masks were combined into one golden mask that allowed him to use all of his mask powers at once.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Toa then descended to the deep tunnels of the island where they faced shadow versions of themselves, created by the Makuta. They were victorious and reemerged and finished the task of reverting the Rahi to normal.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Toa later faced the threat of the Bohrok swarms, mechanical creatures that functioned as suits for the Krata. The Toa gathered one of each kind of Krata and used them to unlock and activate the Exo-Toa, special power suits of armor. They then used these suits to battle the Bahrag twin queens. At the end of the battle they took off the armor to unite and use their combined power to imprison the Bahrag. The resulting energy burst threw them into pools of energized molten protodermis, transforming them into the Toa Nuva.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Tahu Nuva</h3><p>Once the transformation occured, Tahu became Tahu Nuva. His golden mask was turned into the Hau Nuva and was given a new look. It could no longer give him the powers of underwater breathing, x-ray vision, super speed, super strength or levitation, but he could extend his shield to those around him and the shield was no longer weak against ambushes. His sword was transformed into two more powerful ones that could be put together as a double sword or ridden as a surf board. Tahu nuva also had much greater fire control and could channel it through his swords in a variety of ways, including a heat or fire blast, slamming them into the ground, and sending out a stream of heat in the direction of the strike.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shortly after the Bohrok Kal attempted to free the Bahrag, Tahu Nuva was given the Kanohi Vahi, the powerful Mask of Time, by the Turaga Vakama, who also cautioned him against its use. It gave him complete control of time. He used to defeat the Bohrak Kal by slowing time long enough for the other Toa to stop them from freeing the Bahrag.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Powers</h2><p>Tahu can control and produce fire with almost no limit. Extensive use of his fire powers in a short amount of time can drain him but he can absorb energy from fire and heat to recharge. He wields a large fire sword that can cut through metal and stone. He posseses the Great Kanohi Hau that gives him the ability to produce a protective force field that can repel all attacks except for surprise ambushes. He is an adept lavasurfer and he surfs using a large rock for a board. His being is comprised of biomechanical metal called protodermis. </p><p> </p>",

At ten, his mother was mysteriously assassinated and his sister crippled and blinded, he and his sister were sent to Japan to live with the Prime Minister's family. Later, after the Britannian invasion of Japan, Lelouch and Nunnally were thought dead. They changed their last names to Lamperouge, living as normal Britannian citizens.</p><p>Lelouch forever more had a great hatred for Britannia, swearing to destroy it and his father, as well as reveal the truth behind his mother's murder, and create a safe world for his sister.

He was raised around Nunnally, as well as his half-sisters Cornelia and Euphemia li Britannia, who he was closest to among his half-siblings.

His sister, Nunnally, was crippled from the waist down during the incident, and she was psychologically damaged, never opening her eyes. Lelouch met his father in the throne room regarding his mother's death and sister's condition. The Emperor dismissed him as a child and appeared very cold regarding the death of his mother and Nunnally's condition. In his anger, Lelouch renounced his claim to the throne, and his father scolded him for his arrogance, ordering that Lelouch and Nunnally be sent to Japan as political tools.</p><p>Lelouch and Nunnally were sent to live with the family of Japan's Prime Minister, Kururugi, and his family - which included his son, <a href=\"/suzaku-kururugi/4005-50977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50977\">Suzaku Kururugi</a>. Suzaku disliked Lelouch due to his royal status, but they soon became very good friends.</p><p>Unfortunately, their time together was short lived. Britannia invaded Japan utilizing their advanced Knightmare frames - armored mech suits which teared through the Japanese army. Japan was renamed \"Area 11,\" and its people referred to as \"Elevens.\" During the invasion, Lelouch and Nunnally were officially recorded as dead.</p><p>Lelouch and Nunnally were separated from Suzaku. The two royal siblings were taken in by the Ashford Family, kept in hiding and their last names changed to \"Lamperouge\" in order to keep their royal status secret.</p><p> </p><h4>Obtaining Geass</h4><p> </p><p>Lelouch and Nunnally resided at the Ashford Academy for years, living in the student council clubhouse on campus, rather than in the dorms, so Nunnally and Lelouch could remain together. Lelouch became the vice president of the student council, and Nunnally was dubbed an unofficial \"junior member\" of the council, because she wasn't old enough. The principle and his grand daughter, Milly Ashford - the student council president - are among the only people to know Lelouch's royal status. In his spare time, Lelouch took to illegally gambling at chess, at which he was unbeatable. He did so to alleviate his boredom. However, he still fully intended to eventually bring down Britannia. During this time, Area 11 was in the control of Prince Clovis la Britannia.</p><p>One day, on his way back to school near the Shunjuko, Lelouch witnessed an accident, where a truck crashed on the side of a road. He went to help, and accidentally fell into the back of the truck. He discovered that the truck was being driven by terrorists who had stolen a bio weapon from Britannian labs.</p><p>In an effort to escape the Britannian military, the terrorists retreated underground, one of them attacking the military head on in a stolen Knightmare. Underground, a Britannian soldier attacked Lelouch, believing him to be a terrorist. The soldier, however, realized who Lelouch was, and removed his mask to reveal that he was Suzaku Kururugi, Lelouch's old friend. Their reunion was interrupted when the stolen device in the truck opened to reveal not a bio weapon, but a green-haired woman.</p><p>When Suzaku's superiors arrived, they ordered him to execute Lelouch, but he refused. For disobeying orders, the commander shot Suzaku. Suddenly, the truck exploded, the ensuing chaos allowing Lelouch and the woman to escape. At the time on the surface, the Shinjuku ghetto had come under siege, its people executed and the buildings leveled in order to keep hidden their secret - the green-haired woman.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/303294-190688-lelouch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-303294\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.6875\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/303294-190688-lelouch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-303294\"><img alt=\"A demon is born\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/303294-190688-lelouch.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/303294-190688-lelouch.jpg 400w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/303294-190688-lelouch.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A demon is born</figcaption></figure><p>Lelouch and the green-haired woman underground were captured by Britannian soldiers; they intended to capture the girl and execute Lelouch. When they tried to kill him, the girl stepped in the way of the bullet, taking it herself. When Lelouch checked on her, she grabbed him, speaking with him telepathically. She made a deal with him - accept her contract, which was left unexplained to him, and she would grant him the power to escape his fate. He accepted. With his new power known as Geass. He ordered all of the Britannian soldiers holding him captive to commit suicide. It was, at that moment, that he changed all of his plans for the destruction of Britannia.</p><p>Lelouch, with the aide of a stolen Knightmare frame and - with it - the comm channels, was able to direct a small band of resistance fighters to victory against overwhelming odds. He even succeeded in giving the terrorists some Knightmares of their own. In the heat of the battle was Kallen, one of the terrorists involved in the truck heist. However, the tide of battle turned when an experimental white Knightmare entered the fight - unknowingly piloted by Suzaku, who survived his gunshot wound - wiping out many of the terrorists and bringing Britannia to victory.</p><p>But Lelouch succeeded in his primary goal: getting close to Prince Clovis. Lelouch took advantage of the confusion caused by the battle in the Shinjuku ghetto - and a little help from his Geass - to get past the soldiers guarding Clovis. He forced the prince at gunpoint to spare the lives of the terrorists and to stop attacking the ghetto, before revealing himself as Lelouch vi Britannia, Clovis' brother. Lelouch used his Geass on Clovis to make him reveal who assassinated his mother. Clovis said that he did not know, but that Princess Cornelia and Prince Schneizel knew. Lelouch then executed Clovis and fled the scene.</p><p>At school, upon seeing his half-brother dead on the news, Lelouch vomited in the bathroom, after being faced with his first personal kill. However, he quickly overcame it.</p><h4>Zero</h4><p> </p><p>The news showed that Clovis was dead, as well as the fact that they already had the \"killer\" in custody - Suzaku, who was being framed because he was an Eleven.</p><p>Lelouch later discovered that Kallen, the Knightmare pilot, went to the same school as him. He used his Geass on her to confirm his suspicion. But when he tried to use his Geass on her a second time, it did not work - that was when he found out that his Geass only works once per-person. Because of this, Kallen heard Lelouch mention the battle at Shinjuku, and suspected that he was the man who was commanding them over the radio during the battle. But Lelouch was able to utilize a previously-recorded phone call to Kallen from the \"mysterious man.\"</p><p>He told her to meet him on a train car later in the day.

He appeared in a dark cloak and a mask, proclaiming himself to be \"Zero.\" He ordered Kallen and Ohgi to create a replica of Clovis' private car.

Instead, given the incident and Jeremiah Gottwald's loyalty now in question, Suzaku was freed.</p><p>Soon after, the woman who granted him his power - <a href=\"/cc/4005-50978/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50978\">C.C.</a> - returned, revealing that she was immortal. She essentially forced herself into his life, staying with him secretly in his room at the Ashford Academy. C.C. became his confidant - one of the few people who knew about his status as a prince of Britannia and as Zero.</p><p>Suzaku began going to his school. At first, they kept distance from one another, Suzaku fearing that the others would be suspicious of Lelouch and suspect his status as a prince if he was seen befriending an Eleven. One day, a stray cat snuck into Lelouch's room, his helmet falling on the cat's head. The feline then went running around the Ashford Academy, whilst a terrified Lelouch did everything he could to find and retrieve his helmet. Milly Ashford of the student council decided to mess with Lelouch - not knowing the significance of the cat and why he was looking for him - having everyone at the school join in the search, which included Kallen, who already suspected something. However, Suzaku was the first to find the cat, after the helmet had fallen elsewhere, allowing Lelouch to retrieve it later. Lelouch then publicly told the others that he and Suzaku were friends, and Lelouch invited him to join the council.</p><p>After revealing Zero, Lelouch decided to recreate the battle in the Shinjuku ghetto, attempting to defeat Princess Cornelia the same way he defeated Prince Clovis. However, Cornelia proved to be a far deadlier opponent than Clovis; she outmaneuvered his units on the field and almost cornered him into a situation where his identity would be revealed. However, C.C. was able to distract Cornelia by dressing as Zero, and luring Cornelia's forces away. This would not be the last time C.C. took on Zero's identity in order to assist Lelouch.</p><h4> </h4><h4>The Black Knights</h4><p> </p><p>A small band of Japanese loyalists not associated with those allied with Zero held a hotel hostage.

Cornelia's intent was to capture Zero in the process.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1415650\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1415650-code_geass_order_of_the_black_knights_2.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.6975\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1415650-code_geass_order_of_the_black_knights_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415650\"><img alt=\"The Black Knights revealed\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1415650-code_geass_order_of_the_black_knights_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1415650-code_geass_order_of_the_black_knights_2.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1415650-code_geass_order_of_the_black_knights_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Black Knights revealed\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1415650-code_geass_order_of_the_black_knights_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1415650-code_geass_order_of_the_black_knights_2.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1415650-code_geass_order_of_the_black_knights_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Black Knights revealed</figcaption></figure><p>He was able to get into the hotel and into the inner sanctum of the terrorist leaders. When he discovered that their plans did not align with his own, he stated as such. The Japanese leaders moved to kill Zero, who in turn used his Geass to order them all to commit suicide. During the event, he came in contact with Euphemia; he allowed her to live. In an attack by the Britannian Military, done by <a href=\"/suzaku-kururugi/4005-50977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50977\">Suzaku Kururugi</a>, the hotel collapsed, causing many to think that the hostages - including Euphemia - died with the Japanese terrorists.

The battle took place in Narita, where a portion of the Japanese Liberation Front was hiding out inside a mountain. Cornelia intended to wipe out the JLF, hoping to also find Zero. Lelouch was able to sneak a large portion of the Black Knights deep into Narita without being noticed, using his Geass on JLF watchmen. The Black Knights had a fresh supply of Knightmares, which included the prototype <em>Guran Mk-II</em>, a powerful Knightmare that could potentially face off against the <em>Lancelot.</em> The <em>Guran</em> was given to <a href=\"/kallen-kozuki/4005-50980/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50980\">Kallen Kozuki. </a>Zero ordered Kallen to use the <em>Guran's</em> abilities to collapse a large portion of the mountain, killing a very large portion of Britannian soldiers as well as JLF forces. The remaining Britannian soldiers, which included Cornelia and her Glaston Knights. Zero accomplished his primary mission, but attempted his secondary mission: capturing Cornelia.</p><p>The Black Knights were able to corner Cornelia, and Kallen was capable of destroying her Knightmare Frame. However, Cornelia was rescued by Suzaku piloting the <em>Lancelot.</em> Suzaku chased Zero into the forest - neither knowing the identity of the other. Lelouch was almost captured, but was again rescued by C.C., who telepathically drove Suzaku temporarily insane by flooding his head with images. The two retreated, and were later retrieved by Kallen.</p><p>Not long after the battle, Zero met with core members of the House of Kyoto, the most powerful people in the Japanese Liberation Front. Zero was able to deduce the true identity of their leader, that of Taizo Kirihara. Zero trusted him enough to reveal to him that he was Lelouch. Taizo agreed to keep his secret, and he also agreed to further align himself with the Black Knights.</p><p> </p><h4>Geass against Geass</h4><p> </p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3031563\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3031563\"><img alt=\"Mao\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg 640w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mao\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg 640w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/3031563-mao.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mao</figcaption></figure><p>Lelouch found out that Shirley Fenette - a girl from the Ashford Academy who was always in love with him - lost her father because of his actions at the Battle for Narita, where the avalanche he caused killed her father when the wave of debris hit the small settlement beneath it. Lelouch comforted Shirley in the aftermath of the attack.</p><p>Shirley, however, came across a mysterious stranger, who exploited her weakness and told her that Lelouch was Zero, and therefore the one responsible. He then took her away.</p><p>Lelouch, along with C.C., went in search of the stranger, who revealed himself to be \"Mao.\" Mao and Lelouch shared a tram up into the mountains, where they played a game of chess. Lelouch was shocked when he was defeated so easily by Mao. Mao, however, revealed that he himself was also a Geass user; his particular ability was the power to read minds.</p><p>Mao tried to force Shirley to kill Lelouch. However, Shirley broke down, finding herself incapable of killing the person she loved. Mao retreated to the tram, with the intent of eventually returning. As he left, he saw C.C., a person he once knew many years ago. Mao later attempted to kidnap C.C., but was outsmarted by Lelouch. Mao returned a third time, now kidnapping Lelouch's sister, Nunnally, and holding her hostage. He challenged Lelouch to a game of chess to decide Nunnally's fate. Lelouch used himself as a distraction - using Geass on himself to prevent Mao from knowing his true intentions, giving Suzaku Kururugi time to save Nunnally. Mao, however, revealed to Lelouch that Suzaku killed his father a almost a decade earlier. In retaliation, Lelouch used his Geass to prevent Mao from ever speaking again. As Mao tried to escape, he was met by C.C., who shot him.</p><h4>Meeting Euphemia</h4><p>Following the incident with Mao, Lelouch chose Suzaku as Nunnally's \"knight\" and protector, so that he could put all his efforts into being Zero while he put Nunnally in the care of somebody he trusted. However, during a battle between the Black Knights and Britannia, Suzaku's identity was exposed publicly as the pilot of the <em>Lancelot,</em> the same pilot who had been interfering with Lelouch. Lelouch had a brief mental break once he realized that the person he trusted was his enemy.</p><p>Lelouch put together a new plan: capture Suzaku, in the guise of capturing the <em>Lancelot</em> unit, and attempting to bring him to his side. During the fight, the <em>Lancelot</em> was crippled and Suzaku held at gunpoint. However, during the battle, Suzaku gained the upper hand, attempting to capture him.

Euphemia, however, was rescued by Suzaku Kururugi, her knight. It was then that she made a public declaration: that she would create the Special Zone of Japan, where the people of Area 11 could call themselves Japanese and speak their language. Lelouch was horrified, realizing that this move would make his entire mission a failure - that the people of Japan would no longer need Zero.</p><p>Euphemia asked that Zero join her in leading the Special Zone. When he finally agreed, the two step-siblings met privately during the event, where Lelouch could remove his mask and they could discuss the Special Zone.

To that end, he attacked the garden that used to belong to Prince Clovis. Cornelia attacked Lelouch in a bloodrage, damaging his Knightmare despite its inferior specs. Cornelia, however, was defeated when one of her loyal allies turned on her - due to being influenced by Geass prior to the battle.</p><p>Lelouch made Cornelia tell him everything about the death of his mother, Lady Marianne, because Cornelia was head of security at the time. She said that she did not know, and that Schneizel, the Second Prince, knew. Cornelia also said that Marianne had mysterious ordered her to withdraw her forces from the palace prior to her death.</p><p>When she had told him all she knew, Lelouch was forced to retreat, having heard that his sister - Nunnally - had been kidnapped. As he retreated, he was attacked by the rebuilt Jeremiah Gottwald, who had survived his injuries during the Battle of Narita, and returned with a cyborg body. After Jeremiah proved almost invincible, C.C. \"sacrificed\" herself in order to give Lelouch time to save his sister, crashing herself and Jeremiah into the Pacific ocean.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1353022\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1353022\"><img alt=\"Zero's identity is revealed\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg 1280w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Zero's identity is revealed\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg 1280w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1353022-lelouch_animestocks_com__048.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zero's identity is revealed</figcaption></figure><p>He entered the cave where it was believed Nunnally had been brought. However, before Lelouch could proceed, he was cornered by Suzaku. One of Lelouch's Black Knights, <a href=\"/kallen-kozuki/4005-50980/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50980\">Kallen Kozuki</a>, entered the area, attempting to rescue Lelouch. However, she did not prevent him from shooting Lelouch, the bullet cracking the helmet and revealing that Zero was, in fact, Lelouch. Suzaku blamed him for Euphemia's death, ignoring Lelouch's plea to help Nunnally. In fury, the two of them drew their guns, and prepared to shoot each other.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Lelouch was known for having a very stoic personality. He never cared about schoolwork, considering the entire thing trivial even though his intelligence would make it easy for him. He enjoys seeking out and defeating challenges, often playing chess with nobles and fellow members of royalty. In general, Lelouch takes most day-to-day affairs with a disposition of open disinterest, often not even noticing the affection of others, like Shirley - his fellow classmate.</p><p>Lelouch is very caring to one person in particular: his younger sister, Nunnally. One of his primary reason for starting a war against Britannia was so his sister could live happily.</p><p>Lelouch is very cold and tactical, sacrificing anybody - civilians or military - in order to obtain his goal. He killed multiple civilians during a landslide he caused to wipe out enemy forces, and considered it just a simple \"mathematical overestimation.\" It is notable that he did care when he discovered that Shirley - a girl who has always appeared to love him - lost her father in the incident. He also saw no problem with collapsing a large portion of Tokyo, resulting in countless military and civilian casualties.</p><p>The first time he personally killed a human being (aside from using Geass), Lelouch vomited - whether this is because the person was his half-brother or not is unclear. However, Lelouch overcame this very quickly, and killing became nothing to him.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2933273-blackking.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2933273\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.685\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2933273-blackking.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2933273\"><img alt=\"The Black King\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2933273-blackking.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2933273-blackking.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2933273-blackking.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Black King\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2933273-blackking.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2933273-blackking.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2933273-blackking.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Black King</figcaption></figure><p>Lelouch is a natural strategist. As a child, he was a brilliant chess player, besting any who opposed him - except for his older brother, Prince Schneizel. As a teenager, he utilized his masterful skills in real combat, leading a small band of terrorists to victory against overwhelming odds. He could manipulate people and factions with well-spoken speeches, clever lies, and simple tricks.</p><p>Despite his great mind and power, Lelouch is physically unimpressive. He is incapable of even running for long periods of time without running out of breath.</p><p>Lelouch is an unimpressive Knightmare pilot. He usually utilizes advanced Knightmares, but is easily brought down by superior pilots with less efficient technology. However, it is worth noting that Lelouch was capable of the complex calculations required to control the shield on his final Knightmare frame, the Shinkirō.</p><h4>Geass:</h4><p>Lelouch also possesses the power of <a href=\"/geass/4015-56157/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56157\">Geass</a>, which is physically shown as a red symbol in his left eye (eventually, both eyes). With it, he could command anybody to do anything he wanted, as long as he had direct eye contact. While some would try to resist - especially if it went against their nature - they would always submit.</p><p>His limits would be:</p><p>Eye contact. He must have eye contact at the time of the command. At one point, Lelouch was able to reflect his Geass utilizing a complicated series of tiny mirrors. Powers do not work through thick shielding, such as Knightmare cockpits or some visors.</p><p>He may only use it once on a person. While the \"command window\" is open, he could initiate multiple orders or ask multiple questions, but once it was over, he could never use Geass on that person again.</p><p>Aside from his first initial stage, he had two more \"evolved\" stages of power.</p><p>Second stage: He was unable to shut off his power, requiring special contact lenses to keep the power in check. With even the smallest mistake, he could make an order. At one point, when he was unaware of the change, he ordered the execution of thousands of people without intending to. The plus to this new stage is that the \"distance\" restriction appears to be gone. When prior the effects would ware off beyond a distance of about 200 meters, this new power does not seem to have any restrictions, orders being carried out from great distances when circumstances are met.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1352895\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1352895\"><img alt=\"Lelouch with both eyes activated\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg 1280w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lelouch with both eyes activated\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg 1280w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1352895-lelouch_animestocks_com__141.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lelouch with both eyes activated</figcaption></figure><p>Third stage: He no longer needs direct eye contact, capable of bringing an entire room of people under his command on more than one occasion. He was able to influence the entire Collective Consciousness while in C's World. At this stage, both eyes have a Geass symbol, rather than just the left.</p><h4>Knightmare Frames:</h4><p>Lelouch didn't use many Knightmares in combat, since he rather let his army fight and him making the plans, but to be a succesful leader he needed to have a Knightmare too.</p><p>The first Knightmare Lelouch used was a normal Sutherland. A Britannian Knightmare Frame. A Knightmare with 2 chest-mounted Slash Harkens. Optional weapons are, a.o. Assault Riffles, Stun Tonfas and Jousting Lance.</p><p>Lelouch's second Knightmare was a Burai. The Black Knight version of the Sutherland, but somewhat stronger. It comes with 2 chest-mounted Slash Harkens, 1 Assault Riffle, 2 hand-mounted Protectors and 1 torso-mounted Antipersonnel Machine Gun. </p><p>In the time Lelouch used a Burai he also used the Gawain once. This Knightmare was only used once in the Invasion of the Tokyo Settlement. This Knightmare was about three times the size a normal Knightmare. It also had a dubble-seater cockpit, enabling Lelouch to bring C.C. with him. The Gawain was the first Knightmare with a Float System and Hadron Cannons, thus gaining a immens advantage in the Tokyo battle. The Gawain has 10 finger-mounted Slash Harkens and 2 shoulder-mounted Hadron Cannons. The Gawain got lost after his fight with the Siegfried, the powerful Knight Giga Fortress, dragging both Knightmares into the depths of the ocean.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3688069\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3688069\"><img alt=\"Lelouch's Shinkiro\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg 1280w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lelouch's Shinkiro\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg 1280w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111118417/3688069-shinkir%C5%8D.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lelouch's Shinkiro</figcaption></figure><p>The final Knightmare Lelouch used was his trusted Shinkirō. The Shinkirō was a Knightmare based of the Gawain. Lelouch used this Knightmarefor the first time at Horai Island, defending the Li Xingke in the Shen Hu and Empress Tianzi from the Gun-Rus of the Chinese Federation. He later used it to attack and destroy the Geass order. And after that in the Second Battle of Tokyo, where it's two main weaknesses are shown; It doesn't have any melee weapons and it needs to lower it's defense to attack. It's later used in the final battle with Schneizel and ultimately gets blown up by the Tristan, inside the Damocles. The Shinkirō is controlled by a keyboard-based control, as adition to the normal yoke system. The most special about the Shinkirō is its Absolute Defense System. If this is controlled well, it's able to withstand a blast from Mordred's Stark Hadron Cannon, a cannon strong enough to level a small mountain. However, controlling the Absolute Defense System is extremely difficult, and only Lelouch is shown able to do so. The Shinkirō also has 2 wrist-mounted Hadron Cannons, 2 knee-mounted Slash Harkens and 1 chest-mounted Diffusion Structure Phase Transition Cannon, or Zero Beam. A beam fired from the chest, stronger then a normal Hadron Cannon. This can be fired with or without a prism. If the prism is fired first, the beam will hit the prism and turn the beam into smaller beams, devastating the whole battlefield, while staying mostly protected by it's own Absolute Defense System.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Suzaku Kururugi was the son of Genbu Kururugi, Japan's Prime Minister. His family took in <a href=\"/lelouch-lamperouge/4005-50976/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50976\">Lelouch vi Britannia</a> and his sister, <a href=\"/nunnally-lamperouge/4005-51036/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51036\">Nunnally vi Britannia</a>, <a href=\"/the-britannian-family/4060-51039/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51039\">royalty</a> from the Britannia Empire sent as political tools. At first, he hated Lelouch, but the three children became best friends.</p><p>When Britannia invaded Japan, Genbu - Suzaku's father - wanted to resist, fighting against the Britannian invasion with a resistance movement. However, Suzaku thought that this would cause unnecessary bloodshed. And therefore, he killed Genbu Kururugi. His father's allies covered up the murder, calling it a suicide, making his father out to be a coward rather than put the blame on his son. Because of what he did, Suzaku has a deep rooted desire to die, often putting himself in harms way to facilitate this act.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46345/1065953-r2_17_113.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1065953\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.99609375\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46345/1065953-r2_17_113.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1065953\"><img alt=\"Suzaku as a soldier\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/46345/1065953-r2_17_113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46345/1065953-r2_17_113.jpg 1280w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/46345/1065953-r2_17_113.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/46345/1065953-r2_17_113.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/46345/1065953-r2_17_113.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Suzaku as a soldier</figcaption></figure><p>Seven years after the invasion, Suzaku was serving the Britannia army in Area 11 - the area formerly known as Japan, with its people being named \"Elevens\" - as a foot soldier. He was deployed to the Shinjuku Ghetto when a group of terrorist fighters stole a device from Britannia, which they believed was a biological weapon. His old friend, Lelouch, accidentally got involved in it, appearing to be a terrorist. Without either knowing the other's identity, he attacked Lelouch. When the two realized who the other was, they stopped fighting. Suddenly, the device was activated. But it turned out not to be a weapon, but a mysterious woman. A group of soldiers came to the scene in order to take the girl back. Suzaku was ordered to prove his loyalty by shooting Lelouch, which he refused to do. He, himself, was shot by his commanding officer, allowing Lelouch to escape. He was saved by his father's pocket watch, which he kept in in his pocket. Lloyd, a scientist in R&amp;D for Britannia, wanted to test his new Lancelot Knightmare. Despite Suzaku's \"Eleven\" status, he was given the key, launching into battle with terrorists. Unknown to him, however, the terrorists were being led by his friend Lelouch. Once more, the two fought without either of them knowing their identities. Lelouch escaped, as did most of the terrorists.</p><p>Soon after, Lelouch confronted and executed his half-brother, Prince Clovis, using his new found power. Suzaku was framed for the murder, escorted to trial for treason, where he himself would undoubtedly be executed. However, he was rescued by Lelouch - who had begun using the identity \"Zero\" - who took the blame for the murder. Despite the rescue, Suzaku proclaimed his faith in the system, not wanting to go against the Britannian Empire. He said that Zero's methods were too extreme and would lead to more bloodshed, deciding that he himself would be better off changing Britannia from the inside. He left Zero, never knowing that Lelouch was the one who wore the mask.</p><p>Suzaku was acquitted, partially due to lack of evidence - though mostly because of Zero's proclamation. As he left his trial, he found a girl named Euphy who claimed she was running from some men. He accompanied her around Tokyo, slowly coming to love the girl. As the day concluded, he came on Jeremiah Gottwald - who had come under scrutiny after being blamed for something called \"Orange,\" a bluff Zero made up - who was being attacked by Britannian soldiers for treason. He rescued Jeremiah using the Lancelot. During the battle, Euphy came to the battlefield and ordered a halt to the fighting, revealing her identity to be Euphemia li Britannia, princess and sub-viceroy of Area 11.</p><p>On Euphy's request, because she herself never got to finish school, she asked that Suzaku go to the Ashford Academy. He was not accepted by the other students due to the fact that he was an Eleven. It so happened that this was the same place where Lelouch went. The two discussed that Lelouch was in hiding, going under the name Lelouch Lamperouge in order to hide he and his sister's status was royalty. To secure his and Nunnally's safety, they decided not to reveal their friendship, keeping distance. However, Lelouch did not wish this, and soon revealed their friendship to the school. Soon after, Suzaku was - for the most part - accepted, especially by the Student Council, which Lelouch was vice president of and Suzaku joined.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1406013-suzaku_animestocks_com__037.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406013\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.696875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1406013-suzaku_animestocks_com__037.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406013\"><img alt=\"Sir Suzaku\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1406013-suzaku_animestocks_com__037.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1406013-suzaku_animestocks_com__037.jpg 640w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/1406013-suzaku_animestocks_com__037.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1406013-suzaku_animestocks_com__037.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Sir Suzaku</figcaption></figure><p>Suzaku and Euphemia had gained something of a relationship. Euphemia, despite Suzaku's status as an Eleven, made Suzaku her personal Knight.</p><p>Suzaku engaged in many battles fighting against the terrorists led by Zero - who became known as the \"Black Knights.\" It wasn't until much later that Lelouch discovered that Suzaku was the pilot behind the Lancelot Knightmare. He also fought with classmate Kallen Kozuki, one of the few pilots capable of contending with Suzaku in Knightmare combat.</p><p>During a battle, Lancelot and Zero (Lelouch) faced each other. During the battle, the Britannian commanders decided it best to sacrifice Suzaku if it meant killing Zero, and therefore the blasted the area. During the engagement, Zero gave Suzaku the order to \"live,\" causing Suzaku to do everything in his power to survive the event. Suddenly and mysteriously, Zero, Suzaku, Princess Euphemia, and Kallen were transported to Kaminejima Island. Suzaku and Kallen were sent to one side, whereas Zero and Euphemia were sent to the other. During their time on the island, Euphemia discovered Zero's identity, and the two discussed politics and ideologies as they tried to figure out a way off the island. Zero and Kallen escaped using a Britannian prototype Knightmare, while Suzaku and Euphemia left with the Britannian military.</p><p>Euphemia came up with the revolutionary plan to create the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, where \"Elevens\" could live as Japanese and refer to themselves as such, giving them some of the freedom that they desired. Much of Japan loved the idea. Zero noticed that his Black Knights would fall apart, because they would no longer be necessary. Zero came up with the idea of convincing Euphemia to kill him, so he could die a martyr, intending to leave his sister Nunnally in the care of Suzaku.</p><p>Zero met with Euphemia, discarding his mask and talking with her as Lelouch. She refused to kill him; therefore, he resorted to using his Geass to force her to do it. But before he could, she revealed that she intended to give up her title and bid for the throne with the desire of leading the Administrative Zone with Zero. He shook her hand and agreed. She told him that he couldn't convince her to do it even if he tried. He said that, indeed, he had the power to do so. He suggested that, if he wished, he could order her to kill all of the Japanese in the Administrative Zone, and she couldn't resist. Unknown to Lelouch, however, he had lost control of his Geass, losing the ability to control it. He was incapable of stopping Euphemia from ordering the execution of thousands upon thousands of Japanese citizens, including injuring Suzaku. Lelouch took up the mask of Zero again, using this turn of events to his advantage, using it as leverage to go against Britannia.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/303681-149702-suzaku.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-303681\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/303681-149702-suzaku.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-303681\"><img alt=\"Suzaku with Euphemia in her final moments\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/303681-149702-suzaku.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/303681-149702-suzaku.png 400w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/303681-149702-suzaku.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Suzaku with Euphemia in her final moments\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/303681-149702-suzaku.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/303681-149702-suzaku.png 400w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/303681-149702-suzaku.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Suzaku with Euphemia in her final moments</figcaption></figure><p>Euphemia went on a mindless rampage, picking up a gun herself to kill as many as she could. Zero - Lelouch - went to her in the middle of the battle. He told her that she was probably the first girl that he never loved. He pulled out a handgun, shooting Euphemia. Suzaku suddenly descended on the battle, ignoring Zero and his men to scoop the mortally injured Euphemia up in his Knightmare's arms, bringing her to the Avalon - the mobile strategic hover ship used by Britannian royalty. He brought her to the med center himself, but it was too late. She lay dying, asking Suzaku what happened. He discovered that she had forgotten what she had done, and told her that the people were happy, wishing her to die happy. He cried over her, distraught and angered, intent on vengeance.

During the fight, his sister Nunnally was mysteriously captured by unknown forces, and brought to the island of Kaminejima. Zero left the battle to go after her, Kallen following and Suzaku in hot pursuit. Suzaku shot Zero's mask, causing it to fall to pieces and reveal his true identity. Suzaku was not surprised, for he had a feeling that Zero may have truly been Lelouch, but did not want to admit it. The two former friends fired their respective firearms at the other, both missing. Suzaku launched himself at Lelouch before he could fire a second shot. Rather than kill Lelouch, he decided to bring him before the Emperor Charles zi Britannia - Lelouch's father. Suzaku held Lelouch down to prevent him from using his Geass. Suzaku told Lelouch that he could do anything in order to facilitate rising in the ranks of Britannia to change it for the better, including sacrificing his best friend. He held Lelouch as his father revealed that he, too, had Geass, and used it to erase Lelouch's memory of his identity as Zero, his relationship to Nunnally, and his ties to royalty.</p><p>In return for bringing in Zero / Lelouch, Suzaku asked the Emperor to become a Knight of the Round - elite Knightmare pilots who serve the Emperor directly, feared for their abilities and their authority. The Emperor agreed, making Suzaku the Knight of Seven.</p><p>A year later, Lelouch was living \"normally\" at the Ashford Academy once more, his memory wiped as well as everyone else at the school. They gave him memories of a false brother rather than a sister. This \"brother\" was an assassin named Rolo, who watched Lelouch, his mission to kill him should his memories resurface. C.C., the girl who gave Lelouch his powers and the target of the Britannians, gave Lelouch his memories back to him. But he had to give the impression that his memories had not come back in order to maintain appearances.</p><p>Suzaku swore to the Emperor, when \"Zero\" returned, he would kill him. He went back to the Academy in order to keep an even closer eye on Lelouch. When the two met, Suzaku told Lelouch that he'd be talking to the new Viceroy of Area 11. When Lelouch picked up the phone, it was the voice of Nunnally. Suzaku knew that, if Lelouch's memories had come back, he would know who Nunnally was. Lelouch refused to lie to Nunnally, but did not want to reveal the truth. Rolo - who had changed sides and decided to work with Lelouch - helped, using his Geass ability to \"freeze time\" so Lelouch could speak freely with Nunnally briefly. When he came back, Lelouch was able to put on the act that he did not know who Nunnally was.</p><p>During a battle with the Black Knights, Kallen was captured by the Chinese Federation and given to Britannia as a gift. Suzaku intended on using the drug known as \"refrain\" in order to force her to reveal whether Lelouch had regained his memories. But he did not go through with it, realizing that he would be resorting to methods that Lelouch would.</p><p>Suzaku, however, did discover the truth when he went to the secret underground base under the Ashford Academy - which was used by the Britannians to keep an eye on Lelouch - where he found Britannian soldiers under Geass.</p><p>Suzaku was contacted by Lelouch shortly before the Second Battle of Tokyo. Lelouch, confirming that his memories returned, asked him to save Nunnally, because the Emperor was coming. The two met in \"secret,\" and discussed the matter. Lelouch lied, saying that he did force Euphemia to commit genocide - when, in reality, it was an accident. Unknown to Suzaku, he had been followed by Britannian soldiers led by Guilford. Lelouch believes that Suzaku betrayed him, but it was something that Lelouch anticipated. In preparation for such an event, he used Geass on Guilford earlier, making him believe that Lelouch was in reality Princess Cornelia when he tugged on his collar. Guilford saved Lelouch, and the two went to Tokyo.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1065997\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1065997\"><img alt=\"Suzaku, under the Live command, moments before firing the FLEIJA\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg 1280w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Suzaku, under the Live command, moments before firing the FLEIJA\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg 1280w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/46345/1065997-r2_18_174.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Suzaku, under the Live command, moments before firing the FLEIJA</figcaption></figure><p>Suzaku's Lancelot Knightmare was equipped by an experimental and devastatingly powerful weapon known as F.L.E.I.J.A.. Suzaku said that he would not use it, but had it as a deterrent. During the battle, Lelouch intended to rescue his sister, Nunnally. Suzaku's Lancelot became heavily damaged while he was being attacked and was about to die, which he accepted. However, the order Lelouch had given him with his Geass to live kicked in, and he fired to F.L.E.I.J.A. to save himself. It created a giant crater in the center of Tokyo, presumably killing Nunnally and killing thousands more.</p><p>Suzaku later met with Lelouch in C's world, the combined consciousness of everyone on the planet. It was there that Lelouch confronted his father and his mother - who had kept her consciousness alive by possessing the Knight of Six, Anya. The Emperor - who, Lelouch discovered, had become immortal - intended to destroy this world, effectively making everyone's consciousness one and removing individuality. Lelouch used his Geass to tear stop them, his powers evolving. His mother and father vanished, their bodies destroyed and their souls sent away.</p><p>Lelouch and Suzaku partially reconciled. One month later, there was a media conference, where the Emperor was to make his first appearance after disappearing for a month. To the shock of the crowd, the person to come was not Charles zi Britannia, but Lelouch vi Britannia, who declared himself the 99th Emperor of the Holy Britannian Empire. When he was attacked for taking the throne, Suzaku jumped down from above, fighting for Lelouch. Suzaku became Lelouch's personal knight, being dubbed the Knight of Zero. Suzaku served loyally for Lelouch, even against his former fellow Knights of the Round, even killing the Knight of One in combat.</p><p>The fighting escalated. The Black Knights joined with Prince Schneizel, fighting against Lelouch and destroying his fortress. Emperor Lelouch's final stroke was to take the Damocles, which was the single most powerful combative platform / fortress in the world, containing within it the entire supply of F.L.E.I.J.A. weapons. The one holding the trigger was Nunnally vi Britannia herself. Suzaku and Emperor Lelouch stormed the floating fortress. Lelouch was able to get close to Schneizel in order to use his Geass, ordering his to obey Zero unconditionally. He also took the trigger from Nunnally, using his Geass on her as well.</p><p>Suzaku Kururugi faced off, one final time, against Kallen. They fought a brutal and long fight, but it ended in stalemate, with both dealing the killing blow. Kallen was able to escape death, but Suzaku was not so fortunate.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405999\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 704px\" data-ratio=\"0.56818181818182\" data-width=\"704\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405999\"><img alt=\"Zero, the man formerly known as Suzaku\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg 704w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Zero, the man formerly known as Suzaku\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg 704w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1405999-suzaku_animestocks_com__018.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zero, the man formerly known as Suzaku</figcaption></figure><p>With his enemies destroyed, Emperor Lelouch paraded his captives through the streets of Area 11 / Japan, bringing them to the execution grounds - with them included Kallen, Schneizel, and others, as well as Nunnally chained at the foot of his platform. The parade halted when a figure dresses as Zero met them at the road. He made his way through Lelouch's forces, and confronted the Emperor. This Zero stabbed Lelouch through the heart, dealing a mortal blow.</p><p>It was revealed that the plan, known as the Zero Requiem, involved Lelouch intentionally becoming the most hated man in the world in order to unite everybody. He gave the mask of Zero, which was a symbol of hope, to Suzaku. Suzaku was to kill Lelouch in front of everybody, ending the tyranny. As Lelouch lay death, clutched in his crying sister's arms - who, only in the end, realized what he did - as the crowd chanted the name Zero.</p><p>Suzaku Kururugi died in that final battle.

He was even able to outrun an automated machine gun, knocking it down with a swift kick.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1405991\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1405991-suzaku_animestocks_com__010.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 704px\" data-ratio=\"0.56818181818182\" data-width=\"704\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1405991-suzaku_animestocks_com__010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405991\"><img alt=\"Suzaku using his curse to \"Live\" as a weapon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1405991-suzaku_animestocks_com__010.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1405991-suzaku_animestocks_com__010.jpg 704w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/1405991-suzaku_animestocks_com__010.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/1405991-suzaku_animestocks_com__010.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Suzaku using his curse to \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Suzaku using his curse to \"Live\" as a weapon</figcaption></figure><p>Lelouch vi Britannia cursed Suzaku with the order to \"Live\" using his <a href=\"/geass/4015-56157/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56157\">Geass</a> power. He hated this, but was able to use it as a weapon in its own right, empowering him when his enemies would have otherwise killed him in combat. Using this ability, Suzaku was able to match and defeat Bismarck Waldstein - who possessed the power of precognition - by overloading Waldstein's precognitive abilities with his Live command. Prior to mastering his curse, the Live command told Suzaku to run away from Waldstein.</p><h3>Knightmare Frame</h3><p>Suzaku's signature Knightmare is the <i>Lancelot,</i> produced by Earl Lloyd Asplund. Suzaku was the first test pilot to the prototype seventh-generation Knightmare Frame. After the <i>Lancelot's</i> success on the battlefield, the new seventh-generation would be improved upon and variations would be utilized by the Knights of the Round. Suzaku continued using the <i>Lancelot</i> series.</p>",

She was hungry, weak, and wounded. She came upon a nun who took her in with the condition that she accept her \"contract\" - which is when \"C.C.\" gained the mysterious power of Geass. All Geass users manifest differently, and in her case, it gave her the ability to cause others to love her unconditionally.</p><p>People around her loved her, giving her gifts and showering her in affection - C.C. gave many of the gifts back, on the nun's request. As she grew older and her power more intense, she found that the love was meaningless and shallow. One day, after C.C.'s Geass had reached its peak, the nun revealed what their original contract was: the nun would transfer forcefully transfer her immortality to C.C., making her live forever.</p><p>C.C. wandered the world, immortal and persecuted for her \"witchcraft.\" She eventually met a six year old orphan named Mao. She gave him the gift of Geass, which cursed him with the power to hear the thoughts of anyone in the near vicinity. C.C. cared for him, taking him away and living in solitude, for C.C. was the only one whose mind he could not read. C.C. served as caretaker, confidant, and - eventually - lover.</p><p>At some point, she left Mao. She traveled to Britannia, becoming an ally to the royal family. She was an ally and friend to Lady Marianne vi Britannia and Charles zi Britannia. During this time, she bestowed Lady Marianne with the one-time Geass ability to transfer her consciousness into another person. C.C. also become the leader of the Geass Order, a cult that trained in the use and experimentation of Geass and its use.</p><p>After the assassination of Marianne, C.C. left Britannia, wary of V.V. - a fellow immortal and brother to Charles. V.V. replaced C.C. as the Director of the Geass Order.</p><h4>Meeting Lelouch</h4><p>C.C. was captured by Britannian forces and experimented on in order to figure out her powers. At some point, the case she was being stored in was stolen by a group of renegade terrorists attempting to free their homeland of Japan from Britannia. They believed that the case stored some sort of medical supplies or biological weapon - the latter being what Britannia fed to the media.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306175-196192-cc.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306175\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.6975\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306175-196192-cc.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306175\"><img alt=\"Taking a bullet for Lelouch\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/306175-196192-cc.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306175-196192-cc.jpeg 400w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4309/306175-196192-cc.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Taking a bullet for Lelouch</figcaption></figure><p>Along the way, the truck transporting C.C. was accidentally boarded by Lelouch Lamperouge, the alias of <a href=\"/lelouch-vi-britannia/4005-50976/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50976\">Prince Lelouch vi Britannia</a>, the son of Lady Marianne. He ran away with her when the truck exploded. The two were then found by a group of Britannian soldiers, who intended to capture C.C. and execute Lelouch. When they went to fire, C.C. shielded him, appearing to have been killed. She then reached up, touching Lelouch, and offered to grant him the power of Geass in exchange for agreeing to a vague \"contract.\" Lelouch accepted, and with his power, ordered the soldiers to commit suicide.</p><p>Lelouch began to issue orders to the terrorists, who actually managed to defeat Britannian forces. He used his powers to get close to his half-brother, Prince Clovis, and assassinate him. He later began using the alias \"Zero,\" keeping his identity secret from everybody.</p><p>One day, C.C. returned to Lelouch, popping up and revealing that she couldn't die. C.C. stayed with Lelouch, hidden in his room at Ashford Academy. She became his confidant, the only person who knew about his true identity - both as a prince of Britannia, and Zero.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>C.C. is immortal, capable of healing from any wound within a limited amount of time. She has been shot multiple times, shot in the head, survived crashing a Knightmare into the sea, and many other forms of damage. She is also immune to aging, remaining the same age she was when she was first given the power. She has the power to transfer her immortality to another Geass user when the other has reached a high level of power.</p><p>She has the ability to give the power of Geass to any individual if she desires it. Such people would include Lelouch vi Britannia, Marianne vi Britannia, and Mao. Each person has a very different ability.</p><p>She also has the ability to psychically affect somebody, even through indirect contact. She was able to flood Suzaku with memories and horrors, causing him to briefly go mad. She was also able to give Lelouch's memories back to him after his mind had been altered by another Geass user.</p><p>Before gaining immortality and the other aforementioned abilities, C.C. could make anybody fall in love with her. Her powers grew stronger and stronger over time. She lost these abilities after gaining the Geass Code, the source of her immortality. </p><p>Aside from superpowers, C.C. showed she was at least somewhat skilled at hand-to-hand combat, pinning a man to a wall with her foot without any effort. She also appeared to be somewhat skilled at piloting a Knightmare, serving as Lelouch's co-pilot for some time.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Kallen is a Britannian-Eleven girl, who believes herself to be a Japanese person at heart and prefers to be known by her birth name, Kōzuki. Her father is Britannian and her mother is an Eleven; her father comes from a prestigious Britannian family, which Kallen benefits from. She attends the Ashford Academy, where she is a member of its student council and is one of its most outstanding students. Her brother, Naoto Kōzuki, with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death. Both Kallen's stepmother, a Britannian, and biological mother live with her in the same house, but her biological mother is employed as a maid and is often mistreated by both her stepmother and Kallen herself. After her biological mother is arrested for using Refrain (a fictional drug which lets people think they're reliving the past), Kallen changes her views and decides to fight against the Britannian Empire not only for her brother, but to fulfill her new wish for a world in which she can live happily with her biological mother.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3277295\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3277295-6599743713-49113.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 2881px\" data-ratio=\"1.4227698715724\" data-width=\"2881\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3277295-6599743713-49113.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3277295\"><img alt=\"Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (2006)\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3277295-6599743713-49113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3277295-6599743713-49113.jpg 2881w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/47703/3277295-6599743713-49113.jpg 1349w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/3277295-6599743713-49113.jpg 674w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3277295-6599743713-49113.jpg 449w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" data-width=\"449\"></a><figcaption>Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (2006)</figcaption></figure><p>Kallen Kozuki (紅月カレン, Kōzuki Karen) is a lead character in the Japanese anime series <i>Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion</i> from the creators Goro Taniguchi &amp; Ichirou Ohkouchi.

It is radically different from its Britannian counterparts, and its technology is on par with seventh generation Knightmare Frames, such as the Lancelot. The Guren Mk-II's speed and strength can easily match the Lancelot's, but its lack of long-range weapons relegate it to a defensive close-combat role. Unlike Britannian-made Knightmare cockpits, the Guren Mk-II features an unconventional pilot seat, shaped like a motorbike, and a helm-like outgrowth surrounding its retractable head. Its Landspinners fold out from within its legs instead of being attached to the ankle. It is given to the Order of the Black Knights and piloted by Kallen Kōzuki.</p><p>The Guren Mk-II's main weapon is its silver right arm. The arm stands out from the otherwise red-painted mech, terminating in clawed fingers, and it can unhinge at the elbow for a surprise attack. Stored within the palm is the radiant wave surger ( radiation surge), a powerful microwave radiation emitter. By grabbing onto an enemy Knightmare Frame and activating the emitter, the Guren Mk-II can fry the enemy's electronics and warp the frame itself, causing it to explode after a brief pause. The warping effect can also fuse the cockpit to the frame, preventing ejection. While not designed as such, the radiant wave surger can also function as a shield capable of blocking almost any attack, only failing against the Lancelot Conquista's Hadron Blaster. The arm is destroyed in the first season by Suzaku Kururugi, but is replaced in the second season with a slimmer, three-fingered version. The new arm is again destroyed by Suzaku. The Guren Mk-II also possesses a fork-shaped knife, a cannon on its left arm, and a single Slash Harken.</p><p>After being badly damaged in battle by Suzaku's Lancelot Conquista, the Guren Mk-II receives a mid-battle upgrade through a series of rocket-mounted attachments. The upgraded model is dubbed the Guren Flight-Enabled Version (Crimson Lotus Aerial-Type). It gains an integrated Float System and antenna on the sides of its head which carry a radiant wave surger-based shield. A new \"armor-piercing bombardment-type\" radiant wave surger arm replaces the old one. This new arm matches the Knightmare's color scheme, though the forearm is dark gray and the fingers are still silver. In addition to its close-range blast, the new radiant wave surger arm can also fire a concentrated long-range beam or a wide-range blast. The long-range beam can eliminate multiple targets in a single shot. The wide-range blast, though not as destructive, cripples any Knightmares caught in it, and can still destroy weaker craft such as helicopters. Another addition to Guren's arsenal is the 'Gefjun Net', a series of small, fast-moving drones launched from the back of the Guren that surround an enemy Knightmare and release a Gefjun Disturber surge, immobilizing it.</p><h3>Guren S.E.I.T.E.N.

Eight Elements-Type</figcaption></figure><p>After Kallen and the Guren are captured during a battle with the Chinese Federation and turned over to Britannia, Lloyd is given access to the Guren Mk-II. Much like Rakshata and the Shenhu, Lloyd and Cécile got carried away in their modifications and made it too difficult for ordinary people to pilot properly. In his care, it is upgraded into the Guren Seiten Eight Elements-Type (Crimson Lotus Seiten Eight Elements-Type). S.E.I.T.E.N. stands for Superlative Extruder Interlocked Technology Exclusive Nexus. It uses a wing-like Float System designed by Cécile that uses four energy feathers for flight. The system allows the Guren to move at blinding speeds, such that it appears to be little more than a purple blur in flight. Additional armor is added on the legs and left arm, and the antenna have been extended and enlarged, making them appear to be giant ears. The chest armor is extended into the shape of a beak and a pair of green jewels featured prominently on the front. Its radiant wave surger arm has been upgraded significantly. It can be fired like a Slash Harken, and has a Harken Booster for controlled flight. The arm still functions when launched as such. Its original functions are retained and far more potent: the ordinary radiation burst can block a Hadron Cannon blast with seemingly no effort and the hand can crush energy shielding without the aid of the emitter. In addition, it can fire energy disks. The Guren's fork knife is also upgraded, having been retrofitted with MVS capability and made about twice as long.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Anime</h3><h4>Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (2006)</h4><p><i>Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion</i> (コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ, <i>Kōdo Giasu: Hangyaku no Ruruushu</i>) is the first season of the<em> Code Geass</em> series that was created by series director Goro Taniguchi and writer Ichirou Ohkouchi.

He decided to emulate Banner, becoming a physicist, etc. Learning that Bruce Banner can change himself into a creature of immense strength, he attempts a procedure to alter his own body. He is successful but in the process, he develops a multi-personalty disorder. The other personality who wants to kill everyone and wants power tries to fight the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>. In this first fight he is successful because the incarnation he fought was the Gray Hulk aka the weakest Hulk. Attempting to truly kill the Hulk so he can claim to be the most powerful, Mad Man's \"Other\" personality concocts a poison that will weaken the Hulk even more, making him lose strength, and mass. This causes Bruce Banner to die, but the Hulk's Incredible healing factor starts to regenerate his body, slowly filtering out the poison.</p><p>However, the Hulk's healing factor isn't working fast enough so as he fights Mad Man he becomes exhausted and begins to lose muscle, strength, and mass. To help stop this from happening, the Hulk goes to the <a href=\"/leader/4005-7617/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7617\">Leader</a>'s newest hideout and makes him concoct a compound that will destroy the poison in his body. The Hulk threatens to pummel the Leader if he can't help the Hulk stop Mad Man. Luckily, the Hulk survived, and left the Leader alone to fight Mad Man. Mad Man had captured the Prince of Wales, and threatened to kill him if he couldn't have control of the country. The Hulk saves the prince and beats up Mad Man. To end the battle, Hulk hurtled Mad Man into the Thames River. With being too tired and too weak, the Mad Man drowned. His body was never recovered.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Mad Man is a Marvel comics character and was created by <a href=\"/peter-david/4040-40682/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40682\">Peter David</a> and <a href=\"/jeff-purves/4040-29152/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-29152\">Jeff Purves</a> in 1989 and first appeared in <a href=\"/the-incredible-hulk/4050-2406/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2406\">The Incredible Hulk #363.</a> The character is experiencing somewhat of a minor resurgence in the 2012 series of Thunderbolts, writer of that series <a href=\"/daniel-way/4040-41552/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41552\">Daniel Way</a> being a fan of the character \"I chose to use Madman because I was looking for someone who could physically stand toe-to-toe with the Red Hulk\" as explained in an interview.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Madman has relatively few appearances, and hasn't quite attained the popularity as his much more utilized fictional brother The Leader. Recently the character is being used again after a lengthly absence. Daniel Way using the character in Thunderbolts \"Madman doesn't have a whole lot of history or continuity but what's there is interesting. He got kind of weird and ridiculous later on, but essentially he's this really cool Peter David creation. We do know Madman is Phillip Sterns, brother of Samuel Sterns. This story delves into that connection because Madman isn't just a huge stumbling block for Red Hulk and the Thunderbolts, but also for Samuel Sterns, who is now The Red Leader thanks to Ross.\" and despite Madman's small amount of appearances within comics he does have a number of appearances in various other media.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Thunderbolts</h3><p>Recently Phillip Sterns has reappeared in the island nation of Kata Jaya, near <a href=\"/madripoor/4020-42665/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42665\">Madripoor</a> in his Madman persona. Kata Jaya's dictator like leader <a href=\"/general-awa/4005-87116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87116\">General Awa</a> has been suppling his nations military with gamma powered weapons. This use of such a dangerous arsenal attracts the attention of <a href=\"/thunderbolt-ross/4005-3457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3457\">General Thunderbolt Ross,</a> who as the Red Hulk gathers a special team of operatives (<a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra,</a> <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher,</a> <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a> and <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool)</a> for the mission of stopping General Awa. They seem generally unaware of the extent of Madman's behind the scenes involvement. Philip and the Thunderbolts enter a confrontation but it is Samuel Sterns who puts an end to his brother's raging rampage. Philip grabs Samuel and is about to crush him with his bare hands but Samuel whispers something into Philip's ear. All of a sudden, Philip begins to suffer an abnormal brain hemorrhage. Philip's cranium grows to the point that it explodes thus putting an end to a mad man,  </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Much like his main nemesis Hulk, Sterns has the ability to greatly increase is size and strength, however he can achieve intermediary states between his smaller and largest forms. At his largest Madman, possesses incredible strength, of sufficiency to lift upwards of 100 tons. Likewise he possesses superhuman durability, enhanced. A overall setback, is that Sterns suffers from identity disorders, and his Madman persona can wrestle control away from Sterns. Sterns is incredibly intelligent as well, a genius in nuclear physics as well as robotics.</p><p><b>Physical Characteristics (as Philip Sterns)</b></p><p>Height: 5'10\"</p><p>Weight: 182 lbs</p><p>Hair: Blond</p><p>Eyes: Blue</p><p><b>Physical Characteristics (as Madman)</b></p><p>Height: 8'11\"</p><p>Weight: 622 lbs</p><p>Hair: None</p><p>Eyes: Brown</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Video Games</h3><p><b>Hulk (2003)</b></p><p>Mad Man appeared in the video game, <i>Hulk,</i> as a strong boss. You fight him twice, once in the middle of story, second at the end. He looks like he does in the comics, but he never changes size. He always stays about two feet taller and buffer than you. He is the last boss you fight in the game.</p><h3>Television</h3><p><b>The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes (2010)</b></p><p>Madman appears in the Avengers animated cartoon series, episode Hulk Vs. the World. It is a minor cameo appearance. Philip is observed in a prison cell, at the Cube prison, alongside many other gamma and Hulk associated villains.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Living with her boyfriend David Weber in <a href=\"/detroit/4020-55783/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55783\">Detroit</a>, Penny's world was destroyed when David was gunned down by members of the Unholy, a group of demons posing as loan sharks. She herself was mortally shot also. But due to God's intervention, she was given another chance to work as one of the Fallen.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>When taken in by fellow Fallen, she tells them her name is Penny Carlyle, an internet model for punkrockchicks.com. Not able to cope with her newfound life and powers, she rejects the Fallen's offer to join them. However, Penny is also the mayor's daughter and her disappearance, while leaving the corpse of David Weber, is quickly made into a high profile case. Penny is wanted for questioning. Penny learns that people don't see her as she is, but as someone else. Thus she's able to keep herself out of the hands of the authorities. When she discovers that God can give her tasks by pounding them in her head, she accepts the Fallen's offer to join them. During her first mission for God, she's able to kill Defazio, the demon who put out the hit on her boyfriend David Weber.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Her speed is enhanced tenfold, she's near weightless and three times stronger than the strongest man.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Origin</h2><p>A man named William survived the destruction of Kansas.  He saw <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a> as a savior of humankind and created a church worshipping him.  Superman tried telling William he wasn't a godly being.<br/></p><p>William was later given powers that drove him insane.  Calling himself Gog, he vowed to kill Superman.  With the death not satisfying enough, Gog went back in time and killed Superman over and over, each time with a different method.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Current</h2><p>With the arrival of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47070\" href=\"/kingdom-come-superman/4005-47070/\" slug=\"kingdom-come-superman\">Kingdom Come Superman</a> in the current timeline, what may be a coincidence has occurred. Former FBI agent, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31930\" href=\"/mr-america/4005-31930/\" slug=\"mr-america\">Mr. America</a> discovered that a couple of metahuman criminals that claimed to be Demigods were found dead with holes blown through their chests.  He then finds several more \"Demigods\" dead, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50034\" href=\"/new-olympians/4060-50034/\" slug=\"new-olympians\">New Olympians</a>.  Watching from behind stood a man in the shadows with horns on his head.  Carved at the scene was the word, \"Gog.\"</p><p>Mr. America, badly beaten and barely able to walk, staggers into the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\" href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" slug=\"justice-society-of-america\">Justice Society Of America</a> headquarters and asks if they've ever heard of \"Gog.\"</p><p>After Mr. America is treated and Kal, the Superman from the future (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-47070\" href=\"/kingdom-come-superman/4005-47070/\" slug=\"kingdom-come-superman\">Kingdom Come Superman</a>) tells them about Magog from his world, Mr. Terrific tells them that Gog was a normal man born in Chicago.  He was a missionary in Africa and then disappeared.  When he returned, he was wearing the armor and had the staff. He called himself Gog and attacked Superman.<br/></p><p>Kal goes to Metropolis to ask Superman why Gog attacked him.   Superman tells Kal that Gog just appeared and attacked him.  He claimed to be from the future and was the only survivor of a nuclear explosion in Kansas that he failed to prevent.  When Superman had Batman look into Gog's background, Batman discovered his real identity.   They figured he was just disturbed.  Kal tells him that maybe Gog was able to somehow catch a  glimpse into future.  He tells Superman about the destruction of Kansas in his time and how his wife, Lois, was killed by the Joker.  He arrested the Joker and before his trial, a man calling himself Magog killed him.  Soon the people treated Magog as a celebrity.<br/></p><p>Their talk is cut short when Kal hears someone calling themselves a God in Gotham.  They both fly there to find <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30057\" href=\"/hercules/4005-30057/\" slug=\"hercules\">Hercules</a> getting beat by Gog.  After dealing with an angry Hercules, they enter the museum just in time to witness Gog teleporting away.  In the Congo, Gog walks down some ancient stairs carved into a mountain saying he will get rid of the gods that walk the world for they will not save them.  He will make the way for the only savior that will do the job.  He then kneels before a giant head carved or trapped in the side of the mountain.</p><p><i>It is unclear whether or not Gog is, in fact, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41481\" href=\"/magog/4005-41481/\" slug=\"magog\">Magog</a>.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p> </p><p>In his youth, he had an enemy at court, a powerful man who stood between him and his ambition. In his lust for wealth and power, he sought aid from the people of the black arts – a black magician, who, at his desire, raised up a fiend from the outer gulfs of existence and clothed it in the form of a man. It crushed and slew his enemy; he grew great and wealthy and none could stand before him. But he thought to cheat the fiend of the price a mortal must pay who calls the black folk to do his bidding. He had a sorcerer bind the fiend in Hell.</p><p>But a year ago, word came to Valenso that the magician who bound the fiend had been slain. And Valenso knew the demon had escaped from hell. And so Valenso fled.</p><p>Valenso had been followed into exile by a hundred men. Some were soldiers, others were vassals and serfs. Forty were men-at-arms, wearing helmets and suits of mail, armed with swords, axes and crossbows. The other sixty were toilers, without armor but shirts of toughened leather, but were still skilled in the use of hunting bows, woodsmen's axes, and boar-spears. He ends up in Western shores of Pictish territory.</p><p>With his entourage came his niece, the Lady Belesa, and her handmaiden, Tina, among other soldiers and retainers. The Count is stunned when he learns that the pirate Black Zarono has landed on his shore, followed by the buccaneer, Strombanni. Both pirates believe that the Count set out for this deserted place in search of the legendary Treasure of Tranicos. The buccaneers are bitter enemies, and bring their feud to the Count's stronghold. During a meeting one night between the Count, Black Zarona and Strombanni, Conan surprisingly emerges from behind a drapery. All eyes are on Conan, as he dominates the room. The fellows learn from Conan that he himself has found the Treasure of Tranicos, and would be willing to share the loot with the others if they help him retrieve it. They reluctantly make a thieves pact, and agree to join Conan, knowing full well that they will kill him once the treasure is in their possession. Conan, on the other hand, had something else in mind for his companions, chiefly trapping them in the treasure room to have them killed by the demon, taking the treasure with the crews of both ships, and sailing away. Conan's scheme fails though, and the sailors find themselves trapped by Picts, who are surrounding the rocky cleft. The pirates once again declare a truce to combat a common foe. Once the pirates escape the cleft, it's a race to the Count's stronghold, with the Picts in hot pursuit. The story ends with the defeat of the Picts, the death of the Count, Strombanni and Black Zarono.</p>",

He came upon a small world at the edge of his sector, under siege by an alien creature.  Zharan Pel battled what came to be knowen as the Armageddon Creature; thousands of years later to be known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9989\" href=\"/doomsday/4005-9989/\" slug=\"doomsday\">Doomsday</a>.  Adapting to the Green Lantern's power, the creature soon overcame Zharan Pel, killing him and taking his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">power ring</a>.

In a matter of hours, Doomsday made his way towards <span><span><a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">Oa</a></span></span>, killing and disarming hundreds, and wounding a thousand members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\" href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" slug=\"green-lantern-corps\">Green Lantern Corps</a>. Arriving on Oa, the creature was halted by a Guardian. Locked in a contest of wills, the Guardian faltered as the Armageddon Creature adapted to his power.  Realizing the Armaggeddon Creature would soon overcome him and then advance on to the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\" href=\"/central-power-battery/4055-55704/\" slug=\"central-power-battery\">Central Power Battery</a>, the Guardian released the totality of his energies, which destroyed the power ring and, seemingly, the creature as well. </p> <p>Unknown to the survivors, the explosion tore a hole in space, hurling the creature light years away towards <span>Calaton</span>.</p>",

There she was an outspoken critic of the <a href=\"/alien-alliance/4060-56662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56662\">Alien Alliance</a> between the <a href=\"/khunds/4060-18273/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-18273\">Khund</a> and <a href=\"/dominators/4060-56539/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56539\">Dominion</a>, opposing their plan for an invasion of Earth. The Alliance feared that any opposition for such respected figures as a former Green Lantern would insight other worlds to stand in Earth's defense. Seeking to squash these critics before a rebellion was fomented, the Alliance set into motion plans to eliminate the agitators.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The people of Purdaa feared retribution from the brutal Alliance, and had no desire to be viewed as aiding Earth.

This energy is the green light of willpower of the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum. A Green Lantern's ring, considered by some to be one of the most powerful weapons in the known universe, has the ability to affect and use fundamental forces of the known universe, including electromagnetic energies such as gravity, radiation, heat, light, and powerful blasts of concussive force. It is also theorized that the ring also has a basis in other dimensional energies commonly called magic by users of such energies. The ring can also create fields of force formed from an unknown energy that is bound by the users' will. The limitations of such use are the skill, knowledge and imagination of the user.</li><li><strong>Energy Projection:</strong> The ring can be used to fire blasts of energy or create weapons such as projectiles of them. The ring can project beams of force powered by the will of the user. Their appearance does not indicate the power of the weapon. The weapon's power is more an indication of the will of the user.</li><li><strong>Force Field:</strong> The ring can create various force fields of various sizes and shapes to protect the wearer and others in the vicinity. With the cosmic scope of a Green Lantern's duties, it is only natural that the power ring is designed for operation in space. The ring creates a force field around the wearer, protecting them from the hazards of the void including filtration of stellar radiation and microscopic particulate matter which would ordinarily be fatal should the space debris strike the ring wielder at high speeds. An atmosphere appropriate to the ring wielder's biology is created inside the force-field while body temperature is maintained and waste products are removed. Gravitational stresses which could cause injury are stabilized for the ring wielder. Theoretically, a ring wielder could use the ring as their sole source of life support. The force field is created instantaneously whenever needed as part of the ring's automatic defensive system.</li><li><strong>Energy Constructs:</strong> The primary function of the power ring is to provide a weapon capable of transforming the wearer's thoughts into physical constructs through the wearer's strength of willpower. A Green Lantern can create any particular items or construct that they can imagine as long as they have the willpower necessary to will it into existence. The constructs exist only as long as a Green Lantern is fueling them with their willpower. Items created by the rings are not indestructible and are only as powerful as the willpower of the Green Lantern creating them. The types of constructs usually reflects the ring wearer's personality.</li><li><strong>Phasing:</strong> The power ring allows the wearer to pass through solid objects such as walls, though this is also a function of the ring-bearer's will and not an automatic ability of the ring itself.</li><li><strong>Environmental Playback:</strong> Upon request, the power ring can recreate a holographic environment based on data in its memory banks. The ring-bearer can observe events in a ghostlike state, but the cannot alter the outcome of the playback. All objects in the playback will appear in the full spectrum of colors, regardless of the wielder's level of expertise creating simulacra. The power ring will automatically end the playback if outside interference warrants the ring-bearer's undivided attention.</li><li><strong>Invisibility and Light Refraction:</strong> A ring-bearer can render themselves invisible by willing the ring to bend light waves around their body. A similar action allows an experienced ring-bearer to create objects of colors other than green, even simulacrums of living people.</li><li><strong>Energy Absorption:</strong> The ring can absorb and store other energies. Doing so does not replenish the normal store of energy the ring has. For example: a ring that needs recharging but contained a store of electricity could only discharge that electricity.</li><li><strong>Superhuman Strength:</strong> While not super strength of the conventional sense, a Lantern, while using constructs created by the ring, becomes capable of lifting/moving tremendous weights far heavier than they would normally be able to with comparatively little effort.</li><li><strong>Flight:</strong> By the manipulation of anti-gravitons and directed molecular movement, the ring allows the user to fly at incredible speeds. In atmosphere, a Green Lantern has been known to fly as fast as Mach 10 in atmosphere by creating an aerodynamic envelope around their body. In space, a Green Lantern's flying ability has been shown to reach velocities far exceeding light speed. In atmospheres, air friction is not a hindrance since heat is either absorbed or reflected by the ring's field.</li><li><strong>Wormholes and Spacial Warps:</strong> The power ring grants its bearer access to wormholes in space, enabling a Green Lantern to rapidly cut the time and distance needed to respond to an emergency. Black holes can also be navigated by experienced ring wielders. A Green Lantern can travel through a black hole to be deposited outside a white hole in a far off sector of space.</li><li><strong>Time Travel:</strong> Time travel is possible with the power ring, though the further forward in time a ring-bearer travels, the more willpower it takes.</li><li><strong>Limited Cellular Regeneration:</strong> A Green Lantern can use their ring to heal physical injuries in their self or others.</li><li><strong>Electromagnetic Scanning:</strong> The ring has a wide range of detection abilities based on the imagination of the user. If the ring-bearer can conceive of it, they can probably detect it. Most normal electromagnetic phenomena are within the range of the ring, including radio, radar, television, infrared, ultraviolet, microwave, and high frequency band communications.</li><li><strong>Thought Relay:</strong> Otherwise known as a telepathic link, which can be used to coordinate tactics with other Green Lanterns or report of the status of an active mission to a sector partner or other Lantern. The links can also be established with non-Green Lanterns, though it requires more willpower.</li><li><strong>Galactic Encyclopedia:</strong> The earlier rings worn by the Corps functioned as references for their bearers. Having the vast knowledge of the Book of Oa to draw upon, each ring functions as a ready reference on most peoples, stellar events and conditions that may have been seen by other rings or other Green Lanterns.</li><li><strong>Universal Translator:</strong> The power ring can translate virtually any language in the universe, facilitating diplomatic encounters rather than violent confrontations. Complications arise when a frame of reference for translation is not available, as evidenced during Katma Tui's induction of Rot Lop Fan into the Green Lantern Corps. Katma Tui had the difficult assignment of explaining the concepts of \"light\" and \"color\" to the sightless Rot Lop Fan. She overcame this barrier by using sound rather than light as the basis of the ring's power. Some Green Lanterns, such as the planet form known as Mogo, have used the ring to create an intermediary \"being\" to expedite communication.</li><li><strong>Material Alteration:</strong> The Green Lantern's uniform is not made out of fabric. It is created by the power ring whenever the ring-bearer wills to wear it. Most Green Lanterns wear similar uniforms that are programmed into the ring by default. However, each Green Lantern is able to adjust their uniform to fit their own needs, personalities, or whims. The green parts of the wearer's uniform are usually very warm or hot to those who touch it, while the black parts are very cold. The uniform also produces a \"siren\" taking on the form of the Green Lantern Corps' symbol, circling the Green Lantern when active. The symbol, or badge, will not appear on the uniform until after a newly inducted Lantern has completed training on Oa, leading to the term \"White-Circle\" to describe a rookie Lantern.</li><li><strong>Ring Duplication:</strong> A power ring is capable of duplicating themselves. Each duplicate shares the qualities and capabilities of the original ring. The duplicate rings are subject to over-ride control by the original ring-bearer, and take a significant expenditure of energy to create.</li><li><strong>Emergency Beacon:</strong> A Green Lantern in distress can use their power ring as an emergency beacon. The alert can be directed to a Green Lantern's neighboring sector, or it can be a Corps-wide alert.</li><li><strong>Homing Beacon:</strong> A homing beacon in the power ring can lead one Green Lantern to another. Though a power ring can be ordered to disguise itself to elude power ring wielding trackers.</li><li><strong>Mind Alteration:</strong> Though the ethics of mind tampering may be debatable, sometimes it is deemed necessary. As the power ring relies on thought and will to operate, mind tampering is not impossible. The real difficulty lies in properly applying the power. There lies a risk of severe damage to the mind where alterations are being attempted should mistakes be made. A ring-bearer can use the power ring to erase portions of an individual's memories. Green Lanterns have used mind techniques as part of training. New recruits may be subjected to mind scans by other Green Lanterns or the Guardians of the Universe. They are taught to build mental defenses to protect themselves from mental attack. The power ring can also be used to beam information from the ring wielder to another being. Green Lanterns have used this technique to share information regarding their enemies during combat situations.</li><li><strong>Pocket Dimension:</strong> A ring-bearer can use their ring to create a small extra-dimensional holding space in which they can store their power battery for ease of retrieval. These pocket dimensions can be accessed from any location.</li><li><strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The rings can be programmed. They are coded to the wearer to make them unusable if stolen. The ring will refuse to take an action that would kill a being unless they are on Oa or have obtained permission. The Guardians recently removed the lethal force prohibition, first to allow lethal force against members of the Sinestro Corps, then against all enemies of the Green Lantern Corps.</li><li><strong>Preset Conditions:</strong> Commands can be stored in the ring to be executed at a later date even if the bearer is not wearing the ring.</li></ul>",

When the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\">Guardians of the Universe</a> requested that he undertake a suicidal mission to stop a black hole from destroying the Galaxy, Quarzz demonstrated the true heroism of a Green Lantern. With a tremendous display of willpower, Quarzz closed the devastating vortex and rescued two starships from being crushed by it's destructive force. Although he succeeded, the ordeal was too much for Quarzz to endure. Lying on an asteroid fragment battered and barely breathing, Quarzz was content that he executed his duty and once again enjoyed a quiet moment looking upon the wonders of the universe he had protected for so long. </p><p> </p><p>Quarzz was found by his friends and fellow <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Corpsmen</a>, <a href=\"/ghrll/4005-49687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49687\">Ghr'll</a> and <a href=\"/xylpth/4005-49688/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49688\">Xylpth</a>. The two Lanterns offered to speed their friend to <a href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\">Oa</a>, hoping that the Guardians could save his life. Quarzz refused, instead he requested that they leave him to enjoy the majesty of the universe for a little while longer, before death finally claimed the valant Green Lantern.</p>",

Unfortunely, due to recent events, and sending <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49487\" href=\"/mowgli/4005-49487/\">Mowgli</a> off to find Bigby, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5961\" href=\"/prince-charming/4005-5961/\">Prince Charming</a> had forgotten. Another problem was that no one could speak Arabic and Yusuf's speaking skills weren't well taught in English. Eventually after many hours, King Cole came and impressed Sinbad with his knowledge of the Arabic language. With Cole's help, Sinbad developed fast friendships with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5980\" href=\"/king-cole/4005-5980/\">King Cole</a> and Prince Charming, whom eventually convinced him that keeping slaves was wrong. Slowly, Sinbad became very intrigued by America's new laws and ways. However, Yusuf found it disgraceful.</p><p>Eventually, he released a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45183\" href=\"/djinn/4005-45183/\">d'jinn</a> from a bottle, in order to destroy Fabletown and its citizens and put him in control of both the European and Arabian fable communities. However, he didn't count on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5973\" href=\"/frau-totenkinder/4005-5973/\">Frau Totenkinder</a> guessing a possible traitor amongst them. Although Frau didn't speak Arabic, she did use her magic powers to warp his language, so that the commands he gave were not what he intended, ultimately leading to his own prolonged demise and the recapture of the d'jinn.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>In October of 1985, Karl Moore was a football player for Notre Dame University. Moore was skilled, but there was another player who stood out even Moore during games and practices. That player's name was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21607\" href=\"/nfl-superpro/4005-21607/\" slug=\"nfl-superpro\">Phil Grayfield</a>. Karl was jealous of Moore's success and shrived to be better than him. Moore obsessed over previous games and plays. After a game he would often study what went wrong in order to figure out how to make himself a better player.</p><p>Fueled by rage and an acute attention to detail, Karl became a ninja for hire after a stint with the Miami Dolphins.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Quick Kick was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41350\" href=\"/fabian-nicieza/4040-41350/\" slug=\"fabian-nicieza\">Fabian Nicieza</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4040-8033\" href=\"/jose-delbo/4040-8033/\" slug=\"jose-delbo\">Jose Delbo</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-14893\" href=\"/mike-decarlo/4040-14893/\" slug=\"mike-decarlo\">Mike DeCarlo</a>.</p><h2>Character Development</h2><p>When NFL Superpro's heroic deeds began interfering in gang leader, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31819\" href=\"/marco-sanzionare/4005-31819/\" slug=\"marco-sanzionare\">Marco Sanzionare's</a>, illicit businesses, Sanzionare began hiring assassins to take Superpro out of commission. Grayfield's former teammate, Moore, was the first to try. Skilled in the ancient art of ninjitsu and now calling himself Quick Kick, Moore set out to get his revenge.</p><p>Unfortunately with Moore's emotions out of control, he was unable to focus on the task at hand and ended up crashing a plane that Superpro had sabotaged. Quick Kick died in the crash.</p>",

Because of this he was picked on by all the other children.  <br/>    Using the hate he had developed from his past he became an extremely violent assassin. Evem though he is trained to supress his emotions, he still lets his hate fuel him to succeed.  <br/>    In #2 of Sludge he was hired by Marcello to exterminate Sludge. Despite Sludge's size and displayed strength, he was not perturbed and he used an arrow with an explosive on the tip to kill his enemy. <br/>     Later, when Mr Wong and Marcello hold a meeting, Marcello hires Bloodstorm to protect him in case any trouble occurs and he kills another assassin. <br/>    After warning Marcello not to double-cross him, Bloodstorm is hired to kill Lord Pumpkin, and for added fun he decides to wear a pumpkin looking helmet. <br/>    Breaking into Pump's hideout easily and taking out his fishmen cronies he has his scope trained on Lord Pumpkin only to be taken by surprise by Pump's magic, and then his hand gets shot up by Young Pistol. <br/>    Pump then fills him with Zuke, sending him violently crazy where he goes after Marcello, only to get shot to pieces, meeting his death. <br/></p>",

As a child, she bore witness to her mother's murder. The attack left Nunnally crippled from the waist down. She was also believed to be psychologically damaged, unable or refusing to open her eyes - but it was later revealed that her father used Geass on her to cause this.</p><p>She and Lelouch were sent to the home of Genbu Kururugi in Japan as political tools. There, they met his son: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50977\" href=\"/suzaku-kururugi/4005-50977/\">Suzaku Kururugi</a> who, at first, did not like them because of their royal status. But the trio soon became very good friends. However, their friendship was cut short when Britannia invaded Japan, obliterating any opposition. Japan was renamed as \"Area 11,\" and the Japanese people were called \"Elevens.\" They lost touch with Suzaku, and official records showed that Lelouch and Nunnally died. In reality, they went into hiding under the sir name \"Lamperouge,\" and were taken in by the Ashford Family, who protected their secret. They attended school at the Ashford Academy, and were allowed to live in the spacious clubhouse.</p><p>They lived quite happily for some time. Eventually, they were even reunited with Suzaku Kururugi, who had begun working with the Britannian military - but he didn't tell anybody about Lelouch and Nunnally's true identity. Unknown to Nunnally, her brother Lelouch had a second secret identity, which nobody knew about: the rebel known as Zero, who had been leading a rebellion against Britannia. Suzaku joined them at the Ashford Academy, and Nunnally was overjoyed at the reunion.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Nunnally has no actual powers. However, on many occasions, she has been able to tell whether somebody is lying or not through skin contact. She was also able to figure out Lelouch's endgame plan (the \"Zero Requiem\") by touching his hand, causing a stream of flashbacks to occur.</p><p>It is unknown whether this is supernatural or if she is just very intuitive.</p>",

She was originally head of security at the palace when Lady Marianne was executed. She later became Viceroy of Area 11 when she was older.

As a child, she was a dotting older sister to young Euphemia li Britannia, and remained very protective of her even as an adult. She and Euphemia were also rather close to their half siblings <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50976\" href=\"/lelouch-vi-britannia/4005-50976/\">Lelouch vi Britannia</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51036\" href=\"/nunnally-lamperouge/4005-51036/\">Nunnally vi Britannia</a> during the earlier years.</p><p>Cornelia became the head of security for the Imperial Palace. Surprisingly, she was ordered by Lady Marianne herself to withdraw and disable security. Cornelia begrudgingly obliged. That night, Marianne was mysteriously assassinated and Nunnally vi Britannia was badly wounded, resulting in her becoming crippled. Cornelia enthusiastically investigated her death for years, but was unable to discover what happened to her.</p><p>Cornelia built up a feared reputation during campaigns involving the defeat of small rebellions in Britannian Areas - conquered states not given the same rights as Britannian citizens.</p><h4>Area 11:</h4><p>Cornelia became the Viceroy of Area 11 - formerly known as Japan - after her half-brother, Prince Clovis, was killed. Along side her was Euphemia, who acted as sub-Viceroy. While Cornelia was the Viceroy, she was primarily there to defeat the group of terrorists who would become known as the Black Knights. The intended to leave Area 11 in the hands of Euphemia after the danger had been dealt with.</p><p>Cornelia personally led many assaults on small terrorist bands in search of the masked rebel known as Zero - who, unknown to Cornelia, was her younger half-brother Lelouch.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Cornelia was known as a brutal and ruthless combatant and leader - however, she was very well respected amongst her soldiers. She was known for fighting on the front line with her soldiers and did not like the idea of her men dying for her. She also never liked to take glory from other people.</p><p>Cornelia wanted to treat war as an honorable deed, and detested unwarranted loss of life - especially civilian lives.</p><p>Cornelia, from childhood, was extremely protective of her little sister, Euphemia. When Euphemia was killed, Cornelia was in shock for some time. After recovering, she was on an insane bloodlust when she encountered her little sister's murderer. After that, she abandoned all royal ties on a hunt to find the secret to what happened to Euphemia.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Cornelia was known for her skill in a Knightmare, fighting countless warriors and, even after becoming Viceroy of Area 11, preferred to be on the front line with her men.</p><p>Cornelia was also a skilled swordsman, often carrying a blade with her. She utilized a sword during her time looking for the source of Geass.</p>",

She was very close to Cornelia, who doted over her as children and continued to protect Euphemia as an adult. The two were also rather close to their half-siblings, Lelouch vi Britannia and Nunnally vi Britannia. The four of them spent much time at Aries Villa, the garden of Lady Marianne - Lelouch and Nunnally's mother.</p><h4>Sub-Viceroy</h4><p>As a teenager, Euphemia was a student in Britannia.</p><p>Euphemia eventually made her way to Area 11, the land formerly known as Japan. When her half-brother, Prince Clovis la Britannia, was assassinated, her sister Cornelia was brought in to restore order. Euphemia, in turn, came with her, forcing her to leave her school. Euphemia was officially made the Sub-Viceroy, handling small, local affairs while her sister, Viceroy Cornelia, led a military campaign across Japan hunting for Clovis' killer - <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50976\" href=\"/lelouch-vi-britannia/4005-50976/\">Zero.</a></p><p>Euphemia stayed in hiding for awhile, defying her guards and escaping into Tokyo. As she escaped, she met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50977\" href=\"/suzaku-kururugi/4005-50977/\">Suzaku Kururugi</a>, the man who was framed for killing her brother, but was let go when the true killer revealed himself. She called herself \"Euphie,\" preferring to keep her royal status a secret. Lloyd, an earl who led the Research and Development department that was primarily under the command of Prince <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51042\" href=\"/schneizel-el-britannia/4005-51042/\">Schneizel</a>, decided to follow Euphemia, keeping a distance to make sure she was safe.</p><p>Euphemia and Suzaku went to the Shinjuku ghetto, the location of the massacre performed by Britannia that was covered up as an accident. While there, they witnessed an assassination attempt on the life of Jeremiah Gottwald, a Britannian soldier who led the investigation into Clovis' death, but mysteriously let the suspect escape. Lloyd revealed his presence to Suzaku, giving him the Lancelot Knightmare - which he kept in his truck - to intervene in the battle. During the fight between Suzaku and the would-be assassins, Euphemia entered the fray, revealing that she was Princess Euphemia, and ordered all combatants to stand down.</p><p>Euphemia told Suzaku to enroll in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-51035\" href=\"/ashford-academy/4060-51035/\">Ashford Academy</a>. She wanted him to finish his education, because she was not able.</p><p><b>Hostage Crisis</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305576-71790-euphemia.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305576\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305576-71790-euphemia.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305576\"><img alt=\"Euphemia posing as a student\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305576-71790-euphemia.png\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305576-71790-euphemia.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Euphemia posing as a student</figcaption></figure><p>Euphemia went undercover as a student during the Hotel-jacking that was performed by a small group of Japanese loyalists. Euphemia, posing as a student, was taken hostage along with students from Ashford Academy. When one of the terrorists threatened to beat one of the girls - Nina Einstein - Euphemia revealed herself in order to protect the girl, despite her adviser pleading with her to remain in hiding. However, when she was brought before the terrorist leaders, they were all found dead - killed by Zero, he half-brother's killer. For reasons she did not understand, she was allowed to live, despite her royal status.</p><p>The hotel collapsed during the incident due to attacks performed by the Britannian military - which were strategically led by her sister, and actively performed by Suzaku. However, Euphemia and the hostages were rescued by Zero, who used the attack as a public revelation for \"the Black Knights,\" a group of former terrorists who sought the downfall of Britannia.</p><p>Euphemia kept to small affairs while her sister, Cornelia, strengthened her efforts to kill Zero and the Black Knights. After the Battle of Narita, where Cornelia's forces were beaten by Zero, Cornelia told Euphemia that she should choose somebody to be her knight - for protection and because, as royalty, she should have a knight. While she preferred to have Suzaku as her knight, it was not acceptable for her to have an Eleven - Japanese - man be her knight.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2933512\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2933512\"><img alt=\"Euphemia knights Suzaku\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg 1280w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Euphemia knights Suzaku\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg 1280w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/41224/2933512-knighting.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Euphemia knights Suzaku</figcaption></figure><p>Euphemia put off choosing her knight for as long as she could. During a gallery exhibition, where Euphemia had to choose from Britannian paintings to display, Zero's Black Knights freed General Tohdoh, a Japanese loyalist involved in the original war against Britannia. The fight was displayed on the news, showing Suzaku fighting against the Black Knights. During the press conference, Euphemia shocked everybody by publicly proclaiming that she would, against the negative opinions of her sister and Britannian citizens, choose Suzaku Kururugi to be her knight.</p><h4>Confronting Zero</h4><p>Euphemia, accompanied by her new knight, went to Shikine Island on a diplomatic meeting. There, they were attacked by Zero and the Black Knights, who intended on capturing Suzaku and his <i>Lancelot</i> Knightmare mech. During the attack, Suzaku is trapped in a field that causes all mechs to stop functioning. In the scuffle, Suzaku manages to get a hold of Zero. Euphemia is alerted to the fact that orders from a Britannian royal command that Zero be killed, sacrificing Suzaku. Euphemia enters the fray in an attempt to stop them from firing, but they do not, causing a large explosion in the area.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306055-82499-euphemia.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306055\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306055-82499-euphemia.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306055\"><img alt=\"Princess Euphemia and Zero - brother and sister\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306055-82499-euphemia.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306055-82499-euphemia.png 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Princess Euphemia and Zero - brother and sister\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306055-82499-euphemia.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306055-82499-euphemia.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Princess Euphemia and Zero - brother and sister</figcaption></figure><p>They are not killed, however. They were all mysteriously teleported to an island away from the battle. The four of them - Euphemia, Suzaku, Zero, and Kallen Kozuki (one of Zero's Black Knights) - ended up on separate ends of the island. Euphemia came across Zero, who threatened her with a gun. Euphemia, however, causes him to stand down when she reveals who she thinks he is. She asks him to take off his mask, and he does, confirming her suspicions - that Zero is, in reality, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50976\" href=\"/lelouch-vi-britannia/4005-50976/\">Lelouch vi Britannia</a>, Euphemia's older half-brother and former prince.</p><p>The two sat and talked about old times, back when the two of them were children. Lelouch confirms that Nunnally, his sister and Euphemia's younger half-sister, is alive and well. Meanwhile, across the island, Suzaku and Kallen begrudgingly work together to survive in the wilderness.</p><p>They were only on the island for a short time, however. Lelouch and Kallen escaped, while Euphemia and Suzaku were rescued by Britannian forces - which included the one who fired on the island, her half-brother Prince <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51042\" href=\"/schneizel-el-britannia/4005-51042/\">Schneizel el Britannia</a>.</p><p>Afterward, Suzaku was investigated for attempting to leave the battlefield during the initial engagement; he was shown a recording of him shouting that he wanted to live above all else. This was a mystery to Suzaku - who did not remember doing that - and Euphemia, who thought that was extremely out of character. While Suzaku was not arrested, he felt that the event made him unworthy of being Euphemia's knight, and stepped down.</p><p>Meanwhile, a faction of exiled Japanese politicians - allied with Chinese officials, who acted without the direct consent of the Chinese Federation - invaded Japan, setting up a base. Suzaku was sent in to take them down, but his prototype flight unit drained his power. Over the intercom, Euphemia pleaded with Suzaku, and confessed her love for him. At his darkest moment, when Suzaku was almost dead, he was rescued - by none other than Zero. Zero and Suzaku, for the first time, worked together to bring down this rebel faction, who was not working in the best interests of the Black Knights or Britannia. Euphemia was overjoyed that Suzaku and Lelouch could work together. After the battle, Suzaku resumed being Euphemia's knight.</p><h4>The Special Administrative Zone of Japan</h4><p>Euphemia went in secrecy to the festival being held at Ashford Academy, where Lelouch and Nunnally lived. Lelouch was initially horrified, fearing his secret. But Euphemia promised to keep his identity and existence secret, wishing only to see Nunnally. Lelouch, Nunnally, and Euphemia talked about their future, and Euphemia claimed that she had a way to fix everything. At one point during the festival, the crowd noticed Euphemia, and mobbed her. She was, however, rescued by Suzaku. She took control of the situation, asking for a news broadcast. It was at that moment that she made a groundbreaking announcement: she would create the Special Administrative Zone of Japan - a place where Elevens would be allowed to call themselves Japanese, speak Japanese, and act Japanese, granting them freedoms that they did not have for eight years. This horrified Lelouch, who saw it as a sinister move to destroy the Black Knights.</p><p>Euphemia was chastised by Cornelia for making the decision without talking to her, but allowed her plans to move forward. Millions signed up to the Special Zone within days. Euphemia openly asked Zero to join her in her efforts, as well as other Japanese who had been exiled.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305574-53250-euphemia.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305574\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305574-53250-euphemia.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305574\"><img alt=\"Resistance is futile\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305574-53250-euphemia.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305574-53250-euphemia.png 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Resistance is futile\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305574-53250-euphemia.png\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/305574-53250-euphemia.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Resistance is futile</figcaption></figure><p>She met with Zero during a ceremony, the two retreating to where they could talk in private. Lelouch told her his intentions: he wanted her to shoot him, making him a martyr in order to keep the Black Knights in action. Euphemia did not wish to do that, and thought that she and Lelouch could work together to create the Special Zone. He got angry, pushing her away. In an act of anger, he began to order her to shoot him. But before he could, she proclaimed that she planned to renounce her royal status. That shocked Lelouch, who finally saw her sincerity and genuine compassion. Lelouch agreed to work with Euphemia in order to maintain the Special Zone.</p><p>However, unknown to Lelouch, his power known as Geass - the supernatual ability to command anyone to do anything he commands - had become uncontrollable. Euphemia asked how he thought that she would submit just because he asked something of her; he explained his powers, giving her the example that he could compel her to do anything, including killing every Japanese citizen. His Geass activated with that order. Euphemia tried desperately to resist, collapsing to the ground. But, within seconds, she submitted. She ran from him back to the ceremony ground, ordering her soldiers to kill every Japanese person in the stadium. She, personally, shot a Japanese man. The slaughter claimed countless Japanese civilians.</p><p>Zero called in the Black Knights to restore order, and they proceeded to fight Britannia and protect the Japanese. Euphemia herself went on a mindless killing spree, picking up a gun and, later, entering a Knightmare to kill any fleeing Japanese. Suzaku Kururugi pleaded with her to stop, but she did not hear him. Zero disabled her Knightmare frame, entering the battle to end the conflict. Euphemia momentarily realized what was happening, and appeared confused. Zero turned and shot Euphemia through the heart, proclaiming that she was the first girl he ever loved.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306086-181333-euphemia.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306086\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306086-181333-euphemia.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306086\"><img alt=\"Euphemia's final moments\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306086-181333-euphemia.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306086-181333-euphemia.png 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Euphemia's final moments\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306086-181333-euphemia.png\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4309/306086-181333-euphemia.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Euphemia's final moments</figcaption></figure><p>Suzaku, enraged, entered the battle in the <i>Lancelot,</i> scooping up the injured Euphemia. He retreated back to the <i>Avalon,</i> the mobile Britannian command center. He brought her to the medical center, but the doctors claimed that it was too late for her. Suzaku stayed by her side as she slowly slipped away. For a moment, Euphemia had a desire to kill Suzaku due to the residual effects of the Geass, but she resisted it. Without memory of what happened, she asked Suzaku if people were happy; to which Suzaku lied, putting on a face of happiness so that Euphemia died content.</p><p>Cornelia did not arrive in time to see her sister before she passed away. Cornelia was in shock for some time, coming out during the Battle of Tokyo in a blood rage, relentlessly attacking Zero for what he did.</p><h4>Legacy</h4><p>Euphemia was a focal point of hatred for Elevens / Japanese, used by Zero and the Black Knights to rally against Britannia. Even a year after the incident at the Special Zone, she was remembered for her actions. She became known as the \"Massacre Princess.\"</p><p>Suzaku turned all his efforts toward killing or capturing Zero, which he eventually succeeded in. However, Suzaku always found it curious that Euphemia, even as she lay dying, never revealed Zero's true identity.</p><p>Cornelia became hell bent on destroying Zero. After finally encountering him and finding out his true identity, Cornelia turned her attention toward Geass, the power that was used on Euphemia to cause the massacre. Cornelia relinquished her royal ties, going into self-imposed exile on a quest to find the mysterious Geass Order.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Euphemia is very compassionate and selfless by nature. Because of this, she was deemed weak by most of her siblings.</p><p>She is extremely underestimated by many people. However, when she puts her mind to something, it is extremely difficult to deter her. She was able to defy many of her advisers during her time as the sub viceroy of Area 11.</p><p>On more than one occasion, she put herself in harms way to protect somebody else, even strangers. She revealed her royal status just to save a school girl from a group of Japanese terrorists.</p><p>Unlike many of her siblings, she had almost no combat experience - whether as a commander or fighter.</p>",

He is known for his great strategic mind. As a young adult, he was capable of beating his younger half-brother, Lelouch vi Britannia, in chess; he is the only person to ever legitimately do so. Despite the fact that he was second to his older brother Odysseus by birth, he was, and remained, the most influential and revered Prince in the Britannian Empire. </p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Schneizel is extremely charismatic and charming, making allies very easily. In truth, however, Schneizel is cold and ruthless, seeing no qualms in kiling his half-siblings to advance his agenda. .</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Schneizel is known for his great and cunning tactical mind. He is the only person to have ever legitimately beaten his half-brother, Lelouch vi Britannia, at chess.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Jeremiah Gottwald was a part of Lady Marianne vi Britannia's royal guard before she was killed. Jeremiah partially blamed himself for the incident, but also never understood why Marianne order that he and his men not be at the palace.</p><p>Seven years later, after the Britannian invasion of Japan - now known as \"Area 11\" - Jeremian served under Prince Clovis, who was also assassinated. Jeremiah and the Britannian \"purebloods\" take charge of the military in Area 11 and taking control over the investigation, framing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50977\" href=\"/suzaku-kururugi/4005-50977/\">Suzaku Kururugi</a> for the murder. However, on his way to the trial, they were stopped by the masked man known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50976\" href=\"/lelouch-vi-britannia/4005-50976/\">Zero</a>. Zero blackmailed Jeremiah with a device that looked like a bio weapon, taking the civilians in the area as hostages. Zero also made a claim to know about the secret operation known as \"Orange,\" and that he would reveal everything about it. This was, however, a bluff, for there was no \"Orange.\" When he got the opportunity, Zero - who, in reality, was Lelouch vi Britannia, son of Lady Marianne - used a power known as \"<a data-ref-id=\"4055-51037\" href=\"/geass/4055-51037/\">Geass</a>\" to force Jeremiah to let Suzaku and himself go without charges. He obeyed, going as far as to fire on his own soldiers when they tried to stop Suzaku and Zero from escaping.</p><p>The bluff combined with his unusual behavior planted a seed of doubt in the Britannians, causing them believe Jeremiah to be a traitor. He became mocked by his fellow Britannians, earning the scornful nickname \"Orange,\" referencing the false secret mentioned by Zero. He was demoted, losing his title of \"Margrave.\" The only person in the Britannian military who remained loyal to him was Viletta Nu, another person who was subjected to Geass.</p><p>Several Knightmare pilots attack Gottwald, ambushing him in the Shinjuku ghetto. He is saved by the intervention of Suzaku Kururugi, the man who Jeremiah was previously going to have executed. He was also saved when the newly revealed Princess Euphemia ordered that all units withdraw.</p><p>Gottwald was involved in the Battle of Narita, an operation where Britannian military forces - led by Princess Cornelia, the older sister to Princess Euphemia - against the Japanese Liberation Front. Zero and his Black Knights, as the terrorist group had come to be known, engaged Britannia in an act to get the JLF on their side. Gottwald recklessly went after Zero, attempting to regain lost honor. Zero, however, was protected by his ace pilot, Kallen, pilot of the Guran. Kallen easily beat Jeremiah, who refused to eject when his Knightmare began to fail. Eventually, it did initiate auto ejection, but not before Jeremiah was injured in the process.</p><h4>Cyborg</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2658205-rebuilt_jeremiah.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2658205\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 754px\" data-ratio=\"0.86206896551724\" data-width=\"754\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2658205-rebuilt_jeremiah.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2658205\"><img alt=\"Jeremiah Rebuilt\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2658205-rebuilt_jeremiah.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2658205-rebuilt_jeremiah.jpg 754w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/41224/2658205-rebuilt_jeremiah.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px\" data-width=\"754\"></a><figcaption>Jeremiah Rebuilt</figcaption></figure><p>Jeremiah was presumed dead. However, in reality, he was recovered by Britannian scientists. He was brought to the secret facility. He was rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements to his body. Upon first emergence, it appeared that some of his mental sanity had been lost in the process. He piloted his powerful Siegfried against his arch enemy, Zero, during the Battle of Tokyo. In an effort to distract him, Zero's immortal ally - <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50978\" href=\"/cc/4005-50978/\">C.C.</a> - attacked Gottwald, \"sacrificing\" herself to defeat him, both crashing into the ocean.</p><h4>Upgraded</h4><p>A year after the Battle of Tokyo, Zero had returned. Jeremiah was upgraded a second time by V.V., another immortal being. V.V., leader of the Geass Order, upgraded Jeremiah with enhanced abilities. Among his upgrades include: enhanced durability, a retractable sword-length blade from his arm, and - most deadly of all - a Geass Canceler, giving him the ability to take away the influence of Geass from a person as well as himself. It also appeared that Jeremiah's sanity was restored. To that end, in great secrecy, V.V. ordered Jeremiah to find and assassinate Lelouch, aka Zero.</p><p>Jeremiah used his Geass Canceler to track down people who had been affected by Geass, effectively using them as a trail to find Lelouch. While doing this, he brought back to memories of Shirley Fenette, one of Lelouch's friends.</p><p>Jeremiah found Lelouch's residence at the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-51035\" href=\"/ashford-academy/4060-51035/\">Ashford Academy</a>. There, he killed many guards who had been affected by Geass, serving as Lelouch's slave guardians. He was finally met by Lelouch's maid, Sayoko, who served as his last line of defense. The secret ninja fought Jeremiah for some time. The battle was stopped when Lelouch's false brother, Rolo, intervened, using his \"time-stopping\" Geass to hold Jeremiah while Sayoko finished the job. However, Jeremiah's Geass Canceler allowed him to escape Rolo's hold, badly wounding Sayoko and taking down Rolo.</p><p>Jeremiah tracked Lelouch down near the subway terminals. Unbeknownst to him, Lelouch was baiting him. He drew Jeremiah in close, where he activated a Gefjun Disturber - a device that will stop any machine powered by Sakuradite, which included Jeremiah's cybernetic parts. Jeremiah tried hard to resist, but succumbed to the device, revealing to Lelouch his fierce loyalty to Lady Marianne. It was at that moment that Lelouch revealed himself to be Marianne's son. He turned off the device before Jeremiah's wounds became terminal. From that point on, Jeremiah turned his back on Britannia, swearing complete loyalty to Lelouch vi Britannia, aka his former archenemy, Zero.</p><p><b>Lelouch's Ally</b></p><p>After the incident, Jeremiah assisted Lelouch and his Black Knights conduct a secret black-ops strike on the headquarters of the Geass Order, where Jeremiah turned on the ones who created him. During the attack, all scientists, cultists, apprentices, and retirements were killed - including the immortal V.V., when his immortal \"code\" was taken by his brother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-73766\" href=\"/charles-zi-britannia/4005-73766/\">Charles zi Britannia</a>.</p><p>Jeremiah continued to serve Lelouch, participating in the Second Battle of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55973\" href=\"/tokyo/4020-55973/\">Tokyo</a>, where the Black Knights engaged the Britannian forces for an all out offensive. The objectives included:</p><ul><li>Securing the city.</li><li>Taking Lelouch's sister, Nunnally, \"hostage\" to prevent her from being harmed. Led by Rolo and Sayoko.</li><li>Rescue Kallen</li></ul><p>However, not everything went as planned. Kallen was rescued, by Nunnally was seemingly killed when the Britannians launched a powerful, terrible weapon known as the FLEIJA, which decimated the majority of the Tokyo settlement. Lelouch went mad, ordering that all soldiers search for Nunnally. It was Jeremiah who made the move to stop him, taking him away to a safe location. After Lelocuh was secured, Jeremiah went on a personal search for Nunnally.</p><p>Lelouch was later betrayed by the Black Knights, who claimed that Zero had been killed due to wounds sustained in the battle. Jeremiah did not believe the claim, and abandoned the Black Knights. In reality, Lelouch was able to escape the death that his former allies had planned for him.</p><p>Lelouch, in a surprising turn of events, was able to kill his father, the Emperor of Britannia, and took the throne for himself. Jeremiah returned to the Palace, again swearing loyalty to Lelouch, the new Emperor. Jeremiah went on at least one mission to assassinate Lelouch's enemies within the Empire.</p><p>Jeremiah, along with Suzaku, were among the front line soldiers engaging the Black Knights and Britannian soldiers allied with Prince Schneizel. Jeremiah found himself up against the Knight of Six, Anya Alstreim, piloting the <i>Mordred</i>. Anya's <i>Mordred</i> proved a challenging opponent, her Stark Hadron Cannon tearing Jeremiah's <i>Sutherland Sieg</i> to pieces. However, Jeremiah was able to escape with a smaller backup Knightmare, attacking Anya at close range before she could throw up her shields. He then initiated self-destruct, destroying his own Knightmare and parts of Anya's. Unhurt, he pinned the now vulnerable pilot in her cockpit. When she revealed to him that she had no memories of her own - the reason for her obsession with recording everything, including their previous battle - he used his Geass canceler on her. In the aftermath of the battle, Jeremiah was amongst the other soldiers chanting the name of Emperor Lelouch, still standing on Anya's defeated <i>Mordred</i> in victory. During the battle, however, it was assumed that Suzaku Kururugi, the Knight of Zero and Lelouch's personal knight, was killed during the fight.</p><p>A month later, Jeremiah led the parade as Lelouch went through the streets of Japan with his prisoners from the battle, leading them to the execution grounds. The group stopped when Zero interrupted the parade. Many were shocked at this revelation. As the masked figure rushed toward Lelouch, Jeremiah ordered the other soldiers to stand down as he met him head-on. However, \"Zero\" was able to dodge him, and made his way to Lelouch vi Britannia, where he killed him. After the assassination, the resulting chaos worsened by the inclusion of a small band of rebels - led by Princess Cornelia - rushed in to free the prisoners. Jeremiah ordered that all Britannian forces retreat.</p><p>It is revealed that Jeremiah was amongst those who knew of Lelouch's end-game plan, known as the \"Zero Requiem,\" which involved Suzaku faking his death, Lelouch intentionally becoming the most hated man in the world, and Suzaku assassinating Lelouch as Zero. After the incident, in stark irony, Jeremiah retired to work on an orange farm, where he appeared to live happily.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Jeremiah is fiercely loyal to Lady Marianne and Marianne's offspring. He was fully willing to kill Lelouch until he discovered that Lelouch was the son of Marianne, in which case he swore his loyalty to Lelouch, serving him and turning his back on Britannia.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Jeremiah was a somewhat skilled Knightmare pilot, though not exceptional.</p><p>After he was reconstructed by Britannian scientists, he became something of a super soldier. He became almost completely invulnerable to all harm, capable of surviving the self-destruct of his Knightmare without any damage and taking hits from daggers. The only thing capable of bringing him down was a Gefjun Disturber - a device that will stop any machine powered by Sakuradite, which Lelouch designed as a prototype to bring down Knightmares.</p><p>Jeremiah utilized two long, sword-like blades, which came from both of his arms.</p><p>Jeremiah also possessed a Geass Canceler. This ability allowed him to remove the affects of Geass from anybody, including himself. He was able to free himself from Rolo's \"time freezing\" Geass.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><h4>Camelot</h4><p>Lloyd was given charge of the organization codenamed \"Camelot,\" a Research and Development division founded by Prince Schneizel of the Holy Britannia Empire. His mission was to create new technology for the Empire, primarily in the form of new Knightmare Frames. His most treasured creation, which set the stage for the entire Seventh generation of Knightmares, is the <i>Lancelot,</i> an advanced Knightmare that was, at the time, faster and more agile than anything else in the world.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Lloyd's typical demeanor is usually shown to be energetic and carefree.</p><p>Lloyd reserves affection for technology, for the most part. The only ones he has shown any true care for is his partner, Cecile, and Suzaku - both of whom he worked long with in developing and perfecting the <i>Lancelot.</i></p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>After graduating from college with highest honors, Mike Maxwell declined his millionaire father's offer to join the family business and instead decided to join his college roommate, <a href=\"/rupert-kenboya/4005-78006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78006\">Rupert Kenboya</a>, in Africa becoming a game warden and head of the Zambesi nation's new animal preserves.</p><p>When the private aircraft carrying Maxwell and Kenboya to Zambesi was struck by lightning and crashed atop mount Kilimanjaro, the two injured men took refuge in the cavern home of a mutant red ape. While drinking rainwater that had been filtered through the cavern's mineral laden walls, Maxwell suddenly found he was growing larger, stronger and more ferocious, and was able to subdue the attacking red ape with ease.</p><p>Acknowledging Maxwell as its master, the red ape retrieved an ancient helmet from the depths of the cave and placed it on Maxwell's head. Through the helmet, Maxwell was able to read the ape's mind and discovered its name was <a href=\"/djuba/4005-69197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69197\">Djuba</a>. He also discovered that the helmet enabled him to control the actions of all other animals. Agreeing these new powers must be used for the good of all Africa, Maxwell created the identity of B'wana Beast, and became the Dark Continent's super troubleshooter.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>B'wana Beast was created in 1967 by Bob Haney and Mike Sekowsky.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Silver Age</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-378795\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/378795-66137-b-wana-beast.jpg\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.0389972144847\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:103.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/378795-66137-b-wana-beast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-378795\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/378795-66137-b-wana-beast.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/378795-66137-b-wana-beast.jpg 359w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" data-width=\"615\"></a></figure><p>B'wana Beast first appeared in <i>Showcase 66-67</i> where his partner Djuba and him fought against <a href=\"/hamid-ali/4005-60412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60412\">Hamid Ali</a> and the Red Ape.</p><h3>Modern Age</h3><p>In <i>Animal Man</i>, Maxwell decides to retire and tries to find someone to become the new B'wana Beast. He passed on his helmet and elixir to a South African activist named Dominic Mndawe (now called <a href=\"/freedom-beast/4005-46418/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46418\">Freedom Beast</a>).</p><p>B'wana Beast's last appearance was being possessed by an evil force called the <a href=\"/antagon/4005-78249/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78249\">Antagon</a>, which transformed him into the villain called the Shining Man. In the ensuing battle, he is killed by <a href=\"/buck-samson/4005-10249/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10249\">Buck Samson</a> who now calls himself Metaman.</p><p>His latest appearance was in a montage of heroes shown in the U.N in the reboot of <a href=\"/justice-league-international/4050-42590/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42590\">Justice League International</a>, showing that he has been revived. He, however, is not elaborated on and was not explained why he was rejected.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Animal Man #3</h3><p>In <i>Animal Man</i>, Maxwell journeys to America to save his gorilla partner Djuba, who has been tested and infected with an experimental form of anthrax. Maxwell fails to save Djuba, and gets infected with the disease himself, before being saved by Animal Man.</p><h3>Animal Man #13</h3><p>B'wana Beast decides to retire and performs a ceremony to find a successor. He passes the helmet and elixir to a South African activist named Dominic Mndawe, who assumes the name <a href=\"/freedom-beast/4005-46418/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46418\">Freedom Beast</a>, instead of B'wana Beast.</p><h3>Animal Man #47-50</h3><p>During this time B'wana Beast becomes corrupted and possessed by an evil force called The Antagon, which transformed him into the villain called Shining Man. In the battle that followed, Animal Man kills him.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Thanks to the elixir B'wana Beast drinks, he gets super speed and strength of the strongest of Africa's wildlife. It also granted him the ability to telepathically control all wildlife. His main power was the ability to fuse two animals into a chimera, which used the greatest strengths of both animals. At most he can fuse four animals and even humans, but that requires great concentration. These transformations are of a limited duration, and afterwards the animals would be separated and unharmed.</p><h2>Weapons &amp; Equipment</h2><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/bwana-beast-helmet/4055-57529/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57529\">B'wana Beast Helmet</a>: The helmet B'wana Beast acquired in Africa gave him the power to fuse animals and control them. Currently the possessor of the helmet is Freedom Beast.</p><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/bwana-magic-elixir/4055-57530/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57530\">Magic Elixir</a>: The magic elixir B'wana Beast drank on Mt.

He created two fusion animals by fusing together a spider with a horse and a pelican with a shark. B'wana Beast later appears in the Season Two episode \"Gorillas in our Midst!\" In this episode, B'wana Beast is one of the major guest stars, helping Batman when <a href=\"/gorilla-grodd/4005-2380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2380\">Gorilla Grodd</a>, along with other super-evil gorillas, tries to take over <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a>. In this episode, B'wana Beast is romantically involved with <a href=\"/vixen/4005-2551/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2551\">Vixen</a>, who proposes to him at the end. He spends much of the episode uncertain of himself and the usefulness of his powers, but in the end, it his determination and powers that win the day. B'wana Beast also appears in both parts of the two-part episode, \"The Siege of Starro!\" where he is one of the few heroes left to defend Earth from <a href=\"/starro/4005-23345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23345\">Starro</a>'s invasion. He gave his life to save the World and his friends from Starro. They had a Memorial for him all the superheros attended to pay their respect to him for saving their lives in the fight and battle with Starro.</p><p>A running gag in his appearances is that other characters find his powers to be 'creepy', as shown by Batman and <a href=\"/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\">Booster Gold</a>'s spoken reactions, and <a href=\"/firestorm/4005-2353/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2353\">Firestorm</a>'s expression. <a href=\"/billy-batson/4005-2350/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2350\">Billy Batson</a>, however, is an exception.</p><h4>Teen Titans Go!</h4><p>B'wana Beast appears in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/teen-titans-go/4075-113/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-113\">Teen Titans Go!</a> episode \"You're fired\".

    "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kopaka fell from the sky in one of six capules containing the toa. It would become their mission to free the island Mata Nui, where they washed up, from the grasp of the evil Makuta and save Mata Nui, the being for which the island is named.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Powers</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kopaka has nearly unlimited control over ice and the cold. If he uses a large amount of his power at once it may drain his energy, but he can regain it by absorbing energy from ice and cold. He carries a large ice sword capable of freezing anything it touches, including fire, and a small sheild. He posesses the Great Kanohi mask Akaku, the mask of x-ray vision. It allows him to see through walls and also see great distances. The only material it cannot see thorugh is solid gold. He is composed of the biometel known as protodermis. He can withstand extreme cold.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Story</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kopaka was a member of the toa team including Gali, Pohatu, Onua, Tahu, and Lewa. They arrived on Mata Nui unaware of who they were. They found villages of beings called Matoran who had awaited their arrival to free them from the tyranny of the Makuta. The Matoran were led by wise beings called the turaga who knew the toas' names and purpose. It was their destiny to find all of the great Kanohi masks and use them to defeat Makuta who had polluted the minds of the animals of Mata nui, known as Rahi, and put the Great Spirit Mata Nui to sleep. Tahu became the leader of the team.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In their first journeys throughout the island Kopaka gained five other masks aside form his mask of shielding. They gave him the powers of underwater breathing, Sheilding, super speed, super strength, and levitation. At the temple Kini nui the six masks were combined into one golden mask that allowed him to use all of his mask powers at once.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The toa descended to the deep tunnels of the island where they faced shadow versions of themselves, created by the Makuta. They were victorious and reemerged and finished reverting the rahi to normal.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The toa later faced the threat of the bohrok swarms, mechanical bugs that functioned as suits for the krata. The toa gathered one of each kind of krata and used them to unlock and activate the exotoa, power suits of armor. It was Kopaka who discovered the need to do so. They then used these suits to battle the barahg twin queens. At the end of the battle they took off the armor to unite and use their combined power to imprison the bahrag. The resulting energy burst threw them into pools of energized molten protodermis transforming them in to the toa nuva.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Kopaka nuva</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kopaka nuva lost fivew of his masks in his tranformation leaving him with only the x-ray vision mask. Their energy however turned the mask into the Akaku nuva, increasing its abilities and allowing him to share the power with those near him. His ice powers were greatly strenghtend. His sword became a doble ice swor dhta he could seperate and use as skis. His sheild was larger and more durable.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shortly after, the Bohrok kal attempted to free the bahrag. The toa battled the bohrok kal underground.

    "description": "<p>Kevin Thorn is a former New York City journalist who has the ability to see behind the illusions cast by <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55905\" href=\"/fabletown-darkland/4020-55905/\">Fabletown</a> magic-users. After the Battle of Fabletown, the anchorman on the news show Thorn worked for reported an out-of-control block party, a building fire and a gang fight in the Upper West Side; minutes later, the details were fading from everyone's head but Kevin's. After reporting this to his boss, he was fired for \"going all X-Files\". Kevin has now dedicated himself to discovering what exactly is going on in the Upper West Side. He is leaving a complete paper trail in case of his sudden death (which he now considers to be a strong possibility). During the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56320\" href=\"/sons-of-the-empire/4045-56320/\"><i>Sons of Empire</i></a> story-arc, it is revealed that Kevin is acting as a superintendent at a house three blocks away from Fabletown. This house is also now occupied by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44801\" href=\"/hansel/4005-44801/\">Hansel</a> and his staff, though Kevin seems unaware of their true identities. In Kevin's free time (when not spying on Fabletown residents), he is writing a book describing what it is he has discovered of the Fables. He has been keeping an eye on them for long enough now to be familiar with many of the regulars and has noticed the disappearance of several - Bigby Wolf, Snow White, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7264\" href=\"/boy-blue/4005-7264/\">Boy Blue</a> and so forth - linked with references to \"<a data-ref-id=\"4020-55961\" href=\"/the-farm/4020-55961/\">The Farm</a>\". He has come to the conclusion that \"the Farm\" is actually a euphemism for execution, giving him the mistaken impression that the Fables willingly kill their own without reservation. He is aware that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10879\" href=\"/tommy-sharp/4005-10879/\">Tommy Sharp</a> was also investigating Fabletown and was subsequently murdered, which has only served to heighten his misgiving about the Fables.</p><p>During the Jack of Fables arc <i><a data-ref-id=\"4045-55945\" href=\"/the-bad-prince/4045-55945/\">The Bad Prince</a></i> the reason for Thorn being able to see through the Fables' illusions is finally given: he is, in fact, a Literal, beings who are like Fables, but represent literary devices rather than actual characters. Like many Fables, though, he was taken to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56448\" href=\"/golden-boughs-retirement-community/4020-56448/\">Golden Boughs Retirement Village</a> and was stripped of his memories so that he could be made into an ordinary human being. When he begins to regain his memories, he is recaptured so that the process can be repeated. In that process, it is implied he is one of the most powerful Literals in existence, and the soldiers sent to capture him imply that even all of them with their guns could only irritate him, at best, if he fought back. Nonetheless, they manage to bring him back peacefully, where it is revealed Revise is actually his son, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19546\" href=\"/gary-the-pathetic-fallacy/4005-19546/\">Pathetic Fallacy</a> is his father. Though who his mother is, has never been stated. It seems that he became a mundane by choice, and doesn't refuse the notion of losing his memories again.</p><p>It later emerges in the storyline <a data-ref-id=\"4050-28407\" href=\"/jack-of-fables-the-big-book-of-war/4050-28407/\"><i>Jack's Big Book of War</i></a> that Kevin has powers leading to the creation of Fables themselves; however, it has not yet emerged what they actually are. It seems that Kevin refers to Fables as his creations and he consents to the revisions of his son Revise as the lesser of two evils, in an attempt to protect them from his other son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64843\" href=\"/the-bookburner/4005-64843/\">Bookburner</a>. With the revelation of his heritage, it also points out that the Page Sisters are his granddaughters.</p><p>In <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55847\" href=\"/the-great-fables-crossover/4045-55847/\"><i>The Great Fables Crossover</i></a> he's revealed to be truly the creator of the Fables, the embodiment of the <i>storytelling</i>. Having been able to <i>break in</i> a new pen, after destroying the pen (a simple goose-feather) used to write the Fables (and possibly the mundys as well) in the attempt to stop the <i>Writer's Block</i>, he becomes displeased with the current events, as the Fables themselves had grown beyond his control (he explicitly claims that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44960\" href=\"/geppetto/4005-44960/\">Geppetto's</a> transformation in the dreaded Adversary was something he couldn't even fathom), and decided to <i>uncreate</i> them, rebuilding a new world from scratch.</p><p>During this time to get over his <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32702\" href=\"/writers-block/4005-32702/\">Writer's Block</a>, he had called upon the help of the Genres, though none of their ideas helped. In another attempt he called upon Hansel and Sam for help. Hinting that he had at some point a type of friendship with these characters. It is possible that Hansel's over religious zealot attitude inspired him to recreate his world from scratch. In hopes of stopping that scheme, Old Sam quickly disposed of Hansel. Even while <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7265\" href=\"/snow/4005-7265/\">Snow</a>, Bigby, Gary, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61698\" href=\"/mr-revise/4005-61698/\">Mr. Revise</a> were headed to stop him; Kevin showed no mercy.</p><p>Either to humiliate or torture Bigby, he forced him through countless transformations from a donkey, to a chimp, and even a normal and pink colored elephant. And for his ultimate humiliation he turned Bigby into a little girl. Kevin did finally get over Writer's Block by killing his brother, much to Sam's horror. Sam convinces him to shower before writing, when he goes Sam tries getting rid of his pen.</p><p>But the pen literally fried his brain, when he grabbed it due to an overload of information contained in the symbolic pen. As punishment he sent Same to a world where no one could see or hear <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19651\" href=\"/old-sam/4005-19651/\">Sam</a>, living in an apparent permant isolation. After a series of fighting the Genres and eventually meeting up with Jack's son, the group makes it to the house. But they are apparently too late. Kevin took one of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3153\" href=\"/science-fiction/4005-3153/\">Science Fiction</a>'s advice and created a shield to protect himself from them.</p><p>As the group looked in defeat, Kevin promised Snow personally, if he brought her back he'd give her castle and tiara back. Apparently showing disdain for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7266\" href=\"/bigby-wolf/4005-7266/\">Bigby</a>, saying she wouldn't have a mutt. Not knowing what else to do, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28236\" href=\"/jack-frost/4005-28236/\">Jack Frost II</a> is able to freeze him before writing the word end.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-38622\" href=\"/deus-ex-machina/4005-38622/\">Dex</a>, the <i>Deus Ex Machina</i> and the most powerful of the Literals, creates a new, empty universe for the Literals to inhabit and fill out as they please. Despite having a new occasion to create, Kevin expresses displeasure and worries, as after thousands of years spent dreaming the end of the universe, he's unable to write out a beginning to a new universe.</p><p>Although he's a minor character, Kevin is one of the few still alive from the Jack of Fables story.</p>",
