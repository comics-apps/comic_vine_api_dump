    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Lynn Michaels was an officer with the NYPD. When jogging through Central Park, Lynn was attacked by an armed serial mugger/rapist. Punisher and Michaels then teamed up to apprehend the criminal. From then on the two would call on each other a number of times.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lynn Michaels was introduced to Marvel readers through Punisher: War Zone #7 \"Mugger's Picnic\" in 1992 and was created by writer <a href=\"/chuck-dixon/4040-41486/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41486\"> Chuck Dixon</a> and artist <a href=\"/john-romita-jr/4040-13709/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-13709\"> John Romita Jr</a>.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>In The War Zone</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2777579\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117480/2777579-punisher_lynnmichaels__head.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.79185520361991\" data-width=\"442\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 442px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117480/2777579-punisher_lynnmichaels__head.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2777579\"><img alt=\"Lynn Michaels\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117480/2777579-punisher_lynnmichaels__head.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117480/2777579-punisher_lynnmichaels__head.jpg 442w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\"></a><figcaption>Lynn Michaels</figcaption></figure><p>Upon being attacked by the armed criminal, Punisher tackled him and fought him off but confused and shocked, Lynn pulled her sidearm on Punisher, allowing the criminal to get away. Explaining his intentions and that he'd been hunting the criminal, Lynn agreed to team up with Punisher and apprehend him together.</p><p>Identifying the armed criminal through the fingerprints he left on his own bullet shell casings, they tracked him down to his apartment, but after an exchange of gunfire, he escaped and ran for a passing train. Punisher jumped the train also but Lynn was left behind. Due to the scene at Central Park however, Lynn was identified as having worked with the Punisher by an onlooker and the assassin, <a href=\"/stiletto/4005-2129/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2129\"> Stiletto</a>, followed Lynn back to her own apartment, hoping to find the Punisher through her.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1914045\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83050/1914045-punisher12.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.78001703093954\" data-width=\"3523\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3523px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83050/1914045-punisher12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1914045\"><img alt=\"He's got his reasons\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83050/1914045-punisher12.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83050/1914045-punisher12.jpg 3523w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83050/1914045-punisher12.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83050/1914045-punisher12.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>He's got his reasons</figcaption></figure><p>Punisher, at the time having killed the mugger/rapist and two more assassins, went back to Lynn to see to his own wounds. While there, Stiletto, who had crept in and hidden in the dark, attacked and stabbed Lynn in the shoulder and Punisher shot him dead in retaliation. Lynn planted a kiss on him as thanks for saving her life.</p><p>Lynn Michaels crossed over to Punisher War Journal in issue #57 when Punisher called for her help in solving the \"Vampire Killings\" case, where she would this time save his life. She became a regular in the series and after becoming disgusted with the legal process when evidence against child killer Charles Dirkin was ruled inadmissable, she quit the force and went her own way. Shortly after, when Dirkin was imprisoned, Lynn sent him a package of cigarettes. When he went to his cell window to smoke, she killed him with a sniper rifle, having taken up the role of the Punisher.</p><h3>Frank Castle Is Dead</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-101149\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2868/101149-191126-lynn-michaels.JPG\" data-ratio=\"0.95\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2868/101149-191126-lynn-michaels.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-101149\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2868/101149-191126-lynn-michaels.JPG\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2868/101149-191126-lynn-michaels.JPG 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2868/101149-191126-lynn-michaels.JPG\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2868/101149-191126-lynn-michaels.JPG 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Punisher missing and presumed dead, the group VIGIL was out targeting vigilantes and went after <a href=\"/payback/4005-11946/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11946\"> Payback</a>, Eddie Dyson. Lynn rescued him and together they formed a duo to better stand a chance against the group. Thery were however caught by VIGIL where Payback was serverely injured and Lynn was beaten. Escaping, they gained knowledge that Frank Castle was still alive and seen in Laastekist, Pennsylvania.</p><p>VIGIL following after them, they found themselves caught in a hard place and after recuperating from her own injuries in the wake of other battles, Lynn went to single-handledly take down VIGIL.

    "deck": "Former police officer turned vigilante, Eddie Dyson went from enemy of the Punisher to one of his allies when his family were killed by the mafia!",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Edward \"Eddie\" Dyson was a rookie cop in the NYPD when he became aware that some of his fellow officers were on the mob's payroll. Not sure what to do, Dyson had an encounter with the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> where Castle convinced Dyson to turn in the officers to Internal Affairs. Dyson promoted to detective for his good work, the mob sought revenge and had his family killed.</p><p>In the belief that the Punisher was to blame, he set out for revenge but Castle swore to help Dyson kill the true man responsible, Steve Venture, a member of the mob. After getting his revenge, Payback felt there wasn't a need to continue being a vigilante but he would soon return to vigilante status when he was attacked by the team VIGIL.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Eddie Dyson aka Payback was created by <a href=\"/chuck-dixon/4040-41486/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41486\">Chuck Dixon</a> and <a href=\"/john-romita-jr/4040-13709/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-13709\">John Romita Jr</a> for Punisher War Zone as a friend and ally on the force to future Lady Punisher <a href=\"/lynn-michaels/4005-11945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11945\">Lynn Michaels</a>. He first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-punisher-war-journal-48-walk-through-fire-part/4000-107932/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Punisher War Journal Vol.1 issue 48</a> (1992).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The War Journal</h3><p>Feared dead after bombing a building full of mob capos, the Punisher was gone and VIGIL were hunting down vigilantes everywhere. Payback was their next target but he was rescued by Lady Punisher and after finding out from fellow policemen that the Punisher was indeed alive and well in Pennsylvania, they went on the run together.</p><p>Hunted by VIGIL and then running into mob boss <a href=\"/rosalie-carbone/4005-11954/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11954\">Rosalie Carbone</a>, they fought a long war of attrition where Eddie was gravely injured and couldn't help Lynn's war against these factions and their hitmen. Meeting up with Lynn's father, they fought off the <a href=\"/punishment-squad/4060-57212/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57212\">Punishment Squad</a> while being tracked down by <a href=\"/heathen/4005-65594/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65594\">Heathen</a> and <a href=\"/the-trust/4060-42163/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42163\">the Trust</a>. Running for a train in their final escape, Heathen killed the Trust's leaders and allowed Eddie, Lynn and her father to board the train so long as they would never come back.</p><p>They escaped to the Michaels Farm in Wisconsin where Dyson was last seen!</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Payback is a trained police officer, and is in peak human/physical shape. He carries around a Remington 870, and a combat knife. His costume allegedly protected him from damage.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Mickey Fondozzi is a loyal soldier of the Carbone family. He was recruited on the pretense of being Italian-American. Actually he is Albanian.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>Meeting the Punisher</h3><p>One day, Mickey was leading four enforcers against a triad bank when Punisher confronted them. Punisher killed Mickey's men but had plans for their leader. Castle wanted Mickey's help in creating the identity of \"Johnny Tower\" and infiltrating the Carbone family. The duo , posing as cousins, would regularly perform missions for Julian Carbone while quietly eliminating other family soldiers. When their cover was blown, they were barely able to escape with their lives. They needed the assistance of Shotgun, a mercenary working for the American government, to do so.</p><p>Julian Carbone met his demise at the hands of the Punisher. His daughter Rosalie took over the family. Rosalie had been romantically involved with Johnny Tower and felt betrayed. Both Rosalie and uncle Sal used Mickey for information on the Punisher's location. Their schemes actually backfired. Now working for himself, Mickey opened a used car sale's lot. Most of the cars in his stock were stolen. Mickey continued acting as Punisher's informant on more serious criminal activities.</p><p>At one point, Mickey and Microchip assist the Punisher in investigating the Secret Empire, a worldwide criminal group with the front as a men's social club. Mickey and Micro are mistaken for two visiting bosses and must improvise their way through the incident.</p><h3>Marvel Knights</h3><p>His criminal career ended when Mickey got hold of the wrong stolen car. It belonged to the Black Widow who came asking questions along with Dagger. Mickey tried keeping his mouth shut. Dagger performed a soul cleansing technique on him. Not only did he tell the two ladies everything they wanted to know, he decided to quit crime and follow the straight and narrow road. Punisher soon realized his best informer had become useless to him. Castle severed all contact with Mickey.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>The Punisher (2004 Film)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015676-mickey+and+bobby.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5015676\" data-ratio=\"0.40666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:40.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015676-mickey+and+bobby.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5015676\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015676-mickey+and+bobby.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015676-mickey+and+bobby.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a></figure><p>Mickey Fondozzi is renamed Mickey Duka and is played by Eddie Jemison. Mickey has been buying guns from Frank Castle's alter ego Otto Krieg. Castle has been trying to establish a connection between the Saints and organized crime by conducting business with Mickey. During their latest meet, Bobby Saint asked Mickey to accompany him during the transaction in order to impress his father. Unfortunately, the FBI react too early with their raid and Bobby is caught in the crossfire. Mickey weeps over the loss of Bobby and fears the wrath of Howard Saint, Bobby's father.</p><p>Bobby's brother Johnny delivers the sad news to his parents and orders to have Mickey bailed out of jail. Howard Saint allows Mickey to live out of respect for his father who saved Howard's life and he kills Bobby's bodyguard who should have been looking after him. As his penance, Mickey is reduced to being a valet at Howard's nightclub \"Saints and Sinners\". As the Saints celebrate the Castle massacre, Mickey is surprised by the sudden arrival of Frank Castle who survived the bloodbath.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015686-mickey+interrogation.jpe\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5015686\" data-ratio=\"0.74903474903475\" data-width=\"259\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 259px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015686-mickey+interrogation.jpe\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5015686\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015686-mickey+interrogation.jpe\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015686-mickey+interrogation.jpe 259w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px\" data-width=\"259\"></a></figure><p>Frank brings Mickey to his apartment and initiates his own brand of interrogation. Frank tells Mickey that the flame is so hot that once it scorches the flesh on Mickey's back, the nerves will be severed to the point that it will feel a chilling sensation. In actuality, Frank cooks a steak for the smell and pokes Mickey's back with a frozen pop. Mickey gives in and tells Frank everything he needs to know about Howard's operation and what are his weaknesses. Mickey offers his services to Frank as an inside man in order to set up the Saints for their own demise because he hates all of the Saints. Mickey also informs Frank that Howard's wife has a routine every Thursday and Howard's right-hand man Quentin Glass is having a homosexual affair with another mobster.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015691-mickey+conspires.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5015691\" data-ratio=\"0.40666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:40.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015691-mickey+conspires.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5015691\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015691-mickey+conspires.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015691-mickey+conspires.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015691-mickey+conspires.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96399/5015691-mickey+conspires.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After Frank is brutalized by the Russian and saved by the tenants from his apartment building, he calls Mickey to put their plan into action. Mickey starts by planting seeds of doubt into Howard's head making him believe that his wife Livia has been having an affair with Quentin Glass. Mickey watches from afar as Howard kills his best friend and beloved wife. For Frank, this is simply punishment but for Mickey, this is sweet revenge.

    "description": "<h2>Character History</h2>A supporting character in the first twenty issues of Wonder Woman volume 2. Mindi was first seen plotting to become <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\">  Wonder Woman's</a> publicist. Before being hired she was seen doodling potential secret identity names for Diana (and in a reference to the Silver Age, Diana Prince was written but discarded). She was displayed as a very ostentatious woman, very interested in appearance and otherwise not very empathetic. She initially approached <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10923\" href=\"/julia-kapatelis/4005-10923/\"> Julia Kapatelis</a> in order that she could talk to   Wonder Woman on her behalf but Julia was initially reluctant. After seeing Diana having some difficulty dealing with the press and failing to convey her message of peace, Julia decided that maybe they should meet after all. Mindi downplayed her appearance appearing in more relaxed clothing so that she could impress Diana. After being hired Mindi, displayed the same behavior as before and was at times ruthless in terms of appearances and merchandising. When Mindi arranged a tribute to Wonder Woman in the Boston Common, Wonder Woman was attacked by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10922\" href=\"/silver-swan/4005-10922/\">  Silver Swan</a> and some of Diana's inner circle began to question Mindi's intentions.<br /> Upon returning from a visit to Greece, Diana was shocked to find that Mindi was dead. An investigation into the death found that Mindi had been corrupted by her newfound status as Diana's publicist, and that some people were interested in seeing her dead. Despite being found after being assaulted, it was concluded that Mindi had already been dead as the result of a drug overdose. She is also sometimes credited as Myndi.<br /><br /><h2>Celebrity Corrupts</h2>Mindi was one of the important supporting characters of the initial part of the Perez run on the Wonder Woman title. One of Perez's key themes was celebrity and the perils which come with it. This was reflected in various other characters to differing degrees - <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\">  Diana</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15791\" href=\"/vanessa-kapatelis/4005-15791/\">  Vanessa Kapatelis</a>, and the Greek god <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15794\" href=\"/hermes/4005-15794/\">  Hermes</a> - but the center of the theme was Mindi. She is portrayed as a shallow person only interested in wealth and fame and the lifestyle that comes with it. She is often displayed as lacking understanding when some characters wish a more private life or for Diana's message to not be so commercialized. She came into conflict at times with Julia over comments she made to Vanessa encouraging negative behavior or attitudes. She was essentially the one extreme of celebrity while Julia was the opposite with her family values and traditional attitudes.",

These are the goddesses of music, song and dance. Thelia’s name had derived from the Greek word thaleia; meaning « rich festivity » or « blooming ». When the Mousai were assigned specific tasks Thalia became the Muse of comedy and bucolic poetry. In this guise she was portrayed with the attributes of comic mask, shepherd's staff and wreath of ivy.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Harley Quinn</h2><p>At the first meeting between <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1696\" href=\"/harley-quinn/4005-1696/\">Harley Quinn</a> and Thelia, Thelia was amused by the feistiness of the adorable character. She is of course the goddess of comedy and Harley does in fact represent a Harlequin, so they were a match made in heaven. Thelia grants Harley some of her powers in return for saving the Gods. Harley had help of course from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2356\" href=\"/mary-marvel/4005-2356/\">Mary Marvel</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3729\" href=\"/holly-robinson/4005-3729/\">Holly Robinson</a>.</p>",

    "deck": "Klarion the Witch Boy is a mischievous magic-wielding villain and occasional hero",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Raised in a magical society in an alternate dimension, Klarion felt stifled by the rules and regulations of his society, as well as what he perceived as the jealousy of others over his natural magical talent. As a teenager he attacked and almost killed his abusive master and ran away from home, seeking to explore the multiverse.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Klarion was created by <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>, making his first appearance in <a href=\"/the-demon-7/4000-12970/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-12970\"><em>The Demon</em> #7</a>. The character was significantly revamped by <a href=\"/grant-morrison/4040-40434/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40434\">Grant Morrison</a> and <a href=\"/frazer-irving/4040-42271/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42271\">Frazer Irving</a>. He was rewritten for the <a href=\"/the-new-52/4015-56061/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56061\">New 52</a> by <a href=\"/ann-nocenti/4040-42297/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42297\">Ann Nocenti</a> and <a href=\"/trevor-mccarthy/4040-46966/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-46966\">Trevor McCarthy</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Bronze Age</h3><p>In his original appearance, Klarion was a fugitive witchboy from the Beyond Country who had dabbled in witchcraft that would have allowed him to exercise control over his elders. He fled both to escape punishment and to seek new knowledge. This version of the character had a natural human skin tone</p><h3>Modern Age</h3><p>In his early <a href=\"/modern-age-of-comics/4015-56028/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56028\">Modern Age</a> appearances, Klarion's history was simply expanded on from the <a href=\"/bronze-age/4015-55978/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55978\">Bronze Age</a>. His parents were described as having been tortured and imprisoned for practicing magic against the wishes of the Elders, and he himself was sentenced to death for trying to help them. This version of the character was unable to be separate from <a href=\"/teekl/4005-11977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11977\">Teekl</a> for long periods of time; it caused his magic to become weak and unfocused. The character's origin was substantially rewritten in the middle of the Age. Born in <a href=\"/limbo-town/4020-56573/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56573\">Limbo Town</a>, a refuge for the lost pilgrims of <a href=\"/roanoke/4020-51701/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-51701\">Roanoke</a> deep beneath the ground, Klarion was curious and constantly questioned the repression of his upbringing and surroundings. Now a human-<a href=\"/sheeda/4060-57043/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57043\">Sheeda</a> hybrid like the rest of his people, his skin is naturally a shade of blue. During this Age the character came into possession of a <a href=\"/father-box/4055-56373/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56373\">Father Box</a>, a cruciform, a submissionary's rod, and the <a href=\"/castle-revolving/4020-56549/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56549\">Castle Revolving</a>. He was able to turn into the gestalt monster <a href=\"/horigal/4005-66337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66337\">Horigal</a>.</p><h3>New 52</h3><p>The New 52 introduced Klarion's current origin and powers. Klarion once again appears to be from an alternate dimension, one that is probably tied to <a href=\"/earth-2/4015-56462/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56462\">Earth-2</a>. In this continuity his familiar is dead or absent for long stretches of time, to no apparent ill effect.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Demon</h3><p>Klarion approaches <a href=\"/etrigan/4005-7367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7367\">Etrigan</a> for protection from the Elders, and later tries to control him, for which Etrigan banishes him to the mystical prison, the Beyond Region. He escapes his banishment and seeks revenge on Jason Blood by creating a spirit double that seeks to destroy Blood and take his life for its own. Though his doppelgänger briefly succeeds in defeating Etrigan, he returns and Klarion is banished again.</p><h3>In the Claws of Demons</h3><p>Escaping once again, Klarion approaches the leader of the Delphi Institute, and offers magical assistance to allow Pound to walk again, all as part of a scheme to lure Etrigan into the open to seek revenge. When Etrigan and <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> travel to an alternate dimension to rescue <a href=\"/etta-candy/4005-15790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15790\">Etta Candy</a>, the sacrifice in Klarion's black mass, Klarion snaps the bond between Etrigan and <a href=\"/randu-singh/4005-13468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13468\">Randu Singh</a>, attempting to trap him. When Etrigan escapes Klarion enslaves him, and directs him against Wonder Woman. Etrigan resists and attacks Klarion, who quickly vanishes, undoing his spells as he goes.</p><h3>Trial</h3><p>Klarion returns to <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham</a> and insinuates himself into the life of the DA Richard Jaynes. He impersonates the man to take over the trial of Singh and <a href=\"/glenda-mark/4005-13451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13451\">Glenda Mark</a>, who have been accused of Jason Blood's murder. He uses his powers to force the judge to immediately convict the pair and sentence them to death. He flees when Blood arrives and derails the trial, and returns to find that Teekl has killed Jaynes' wife. He allows her to also kill Jaynes, and the pair flee.</p><h3>Apocalypse Now</h3><p>Klarion travels to Blood's apartment, where <a href=\"/harry-matthews/4005-13450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13450\">Harry Matthews</a> is entrapped in a pillow after his time in <a href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">Hell</a>. Klarion offers to help Matthews recover his soul and get revenge on Etrigan, who allowed him to be captured by <a href=\"/belial/4005-30480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30480\">Belial</a>. He rescues <a href=\"/tenzin-wyatt/4005-13476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13476\">Tenzin Wyatt</a> from <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum</a> and draws <a href=\"/cth-the-undying/4005-78550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78550\">C'th the Undying</a> up from under the sea. He kidnaps Singh and Mark and travels to a nearby military base to intercept Etrigan and <a href=\"/lobo/4005-6578/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6578\">Lobo</a>. He and his team fight Etrigan, and he forces Jason Blood to emerge and tortures him. Distracted, he is knocked unconscious by Glenda Mark. He escapes in the confusion and steals C'th's weapon, attempting to use it to curse Etrigan and Lobo. His spell is hijacked by Matthews who uses it to teleport away a detonating atomic bomb. Klarion flees in the aftermath</p><h3>War of the Gods</h3><p>Transporting himself to <a href=\"/themyscira/4020-56187/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56187\">Themyscira</a> in the hopes of causing trouble, Klarion sends the soul of Wonder Woman to the Region Beyond, inadvertently assisting Etrigan, who is trapped there.</p><h3>Sins of Youth</h3><p>Klarion is induced by the <a href=\"/the-agenda/4060-19250/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19250\">Agenda</a>, lead by <a href=\"/contessa-erica-alexandra-del-portenza/4005-13025/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13025\">Contessa</a>, to incite chaos in the superhuman community, and thus turn the public against them. He attends a rally being lead by <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a> and casts a spell turning the teenage heroes into adults, and the adult heroes into children. He also transforms several villains into children, and sets them loose. His familiar is kidnapped by <a href=\"/secret/4005-1682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1682\">Secret</a> and <a href=\"/deadman/4005-5690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5690\">Deadman</a>, who possesses her, which causes Klarion to grow increasingly unfocused. He is forced by Contessa to relocate his villains to <a href=\"/alaska/4020-55827/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55827\">Alaska</a> to defend their headquarters. Teekl is held hostage until Klarion returns the heroes to their proper ages, which he agrees to until a cloned version of himself who has been aged to adulthood attacks. He is defeated by his adult self until Teekl returns to him, at which point he and several of the heroes incapacitate him. Klarion destroys his adult self, and reluctantly agrees to undo his spell before vanishing.</p><h3>Seven Soldiers of Victory</h3><p>Klarion escapes his town when it comes under attack by a Sheeda spine-rider. He is pursued by the Horigal, which drives him into the arms of <a href=\"/ebeneezer-badde/4005-66471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66471\">Ebeneezer Badde</a>, who shows him the Father Box, which Klarion takes. Badde attempts to sell Klarion into slavery, which he escapes with the help of Leviathan, a monster composed of children. He travels into the subway system, and thence to the surface world, which he calls \"Blue Rafters.\" There, Klarion meets <a href=\"/mister-melmoth/4005-66324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66324\">Melmoth</a> and his child gang, the <a href=\"/deviants/4060-57071/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57071\">Deviants</a>. Joining them he helps steal a subterranean drill. Later, he discovers that Melmoth intends to enslave all of the children, and break into Limbo Town. He returns home to warn them, and is nearly burned at the stake before Melmoth invades. The gravely injured <a href=\"/submissionary-judah/4005-66334/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66334\">Submissionary Judah</a> names Klarion his successor, teaching him how to transform into the monstrous Horigal, allowing Klarion to drive Melmoth back. Returning to the surface as the Harrowing begins, he steals <a href=\"/misty-kilgore/4005-56377/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56377\">Misty Kilgore's</a> half of the fatherbox and sneaks into Castle Revolving. Using his necromancy magic he takes control of <a href=\"/frankenstein/4005-41226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41226\">Frankenstein</a> and forces him to pilot the time-dreadnought back to Sheeda-Side, becoming King of the Sheeda. From there, it is implied he eventually travels back to begin engaging in his known encounters with heroes.</p><h3>Infinite Crisis</h3><p>During the <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a>, Klarion is among the magic users who gather at <a href=\"/stonehenge/4020-56021/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56021\">Stonehenge</a> to summon the <a href=\"/spectre/4005-2361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2361\">Spectre</a>. Later, he fights in the battle in <a href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis</a> against the convicts released by the <a href=\"/secret-society-of-super-villains/4060-40433/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40433\">Secret Society</a>.</p><h3>Robin</h3><p>While they are wandering through Gotham City, Teekl runs away from Klarion, having sensed dark magick in the area. Searching for him, Klarion solicits the help of <a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Robin</a>, and together they discover that fellow Limbo Town native <a href=\"/uriah/4005-79730/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79730\">Uriah</a> is kidnapping familiars to create a Judgement Beast, a chimera made of familiars. In an effort to free Teekl, Klarion transforms himself and Teekl into the Horigal, but remains trapped in the Beast. Robin is able to free him, and Klarion promises to return the animals and Uriah to their rightful homes.</p><h3>Countdown</h3><p>Travelling to a market in <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/4020-55795/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55795\">China</a>, Klarion encounters <a href=\"/mary-marvel/4005-2356/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2356\">Mary Marvel</a>. He helps her repel an attack by another sorcerer, and requests a fraction of her power as payment. He attacks her in an effort to take her power for himself, but Mary easily defeats him and leaves.</p><h3>Brightest Day</h3><p>Klarion is possessed by a portion of the <a href=\"/starheart/4055-47348/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-47348\">Starheart</a> and driven mad. He rampages through an urban area, causing a great deal of damage. He is stopped by <a href=\"/donna-troy/4005-4913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4913\">Donna Troy</a> and <a href=\"/jade/4005-3406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3406\">Jade</a>.</p><h3>Sorcerer Kings</h3><p>Klarion becomes involved in a rising magical threat, and accompanies <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"/detective-chimp/4005-11270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11270\">Detective Chimp</a>, and <a href=\"/doctor-occult/4005-11291/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11291\">Doctor Occult</a> along the witch's road.

He helps the heroes prevent this world from ever coming to be.</p><h3>Klarion</h3><p>Travelling through the multiverse, Klarion encounters <a href=\"/beelzebub/4005-110508/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-110508\">Beelzebub</a>, who offers him a ride and drops him off in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>.

He soon becomes embroiled in the schemes of <a href=\"/coal/4005-110364/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-110364\">Coal</a>, a mysterious villain who is introducing addictive technology onto the city streets. He ingests a form of future technology to enhance his powers and confronts Coal, and the two fight. Klarion easily defeats Coal by stealing his techno-magic. Later, he rejoins the coven and together they defeat <a href=\"/gargora/4005-66338/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66338\">Gargora</a>, who has followed Klarion into this reality.</p><h3>Rogue Targets</h3><p>Klarion joins the <a href=\"/star-labs/4020-30759/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-30759\">STAR Labs</a> team known as <a href=\"/the-elite/4060-41989/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41989\">The Elite</a>, and accompanies them in their efforts to capture <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a>.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Teekl's origin is unclear. She was living in or around <a href=\"/klarion/4005-11976/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11976\">Klarion's</a> master's house when the witchboy was young. She approached him while he was hiding from his abusive master, and they formed the familiar bond. She apparently died sometime before Klarion left home, and was placed into a jar by Klarion.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Teekl was created by <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>. She made her first appearance in <a href=\"/the-demon-7/4000-12970/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-12970\"><em>The Demon</em> #7</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Bronze Age</h3><p>In the <a href=\"/bronze-age/4015-55978/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55978\">Bronze Age</a> very little was known about Teekl or her origin, save that she had come with Klarion from the Beyond Country, and was able to transform into a werecat, with his assistance. In this Age, Teekl was female. During this age she was described as being able to sense and hunt death, though this has never been expanded upon or seen again.</p><h3>Modern Age</h3><p>Early in the <a href=\"/modern-age-of-comics/4015-56028/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56028\">Modern Age</a>, Teekl was described as having approached Klarion while he was being held in prison, as she had befriended every other witch who had been imprisoned there before they died. Klarion was able to escape, however, and took Teekl with him as his familiar. This version of Teekl was required by Klarion to help focus his magic. Later in the Modern Age, Teekl was rewritten. Now male, he was described as having been born from the Bonding Tree in <a href=\"/limbo-town/4020-56573/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56573\">Limbo Town</a>, presumably specifically for Klarion.</p><h3>New 52</h3><p>The <a href=\"/the-new-52/4015-56061/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56061\">New 52</a> introduced Teekl's current origin and powers, and returned her gender to female.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Trial</h3><p>While Klarion puts his plan to have <a href=\"/etrigan/4005-7367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7367\">Jason Blood's</a> friends executed into action, Teekl is left to guard the District Attorney and his wife. She kills the wife while Klarion is away, and when he returns she also kills the DA, after which the pair flee.</p><h3>Sins of Youth</h3><p>Teekl accompanies Klarion as he wreaks havoc amongst the heroes. In her were-cat form she is possessed by <a href=\"/deadman/4005-5690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5690\">Deadman</a> and taken away from Klarion, who grows increasingly weak and erratic. She is held hostage by the heroes until Klarion agrees to undo his magic. When she is returned to him Klarion is able to defeat the cloned adult version of himself.</p><h3>Seven Soldiers of Victory</h3><p>Teekl accompanies Klarion to Blue Rafters, the world above Limbo Town. He and his master return to Limbo Town some time later when it becomes clear that <a href=\"/mister-melmoth/4005-66324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66324\">Melmoth</a> intends to invade. He is nearly burned at the stake along with his master until Melmoth arrives. Klarion is given the ability to transform them both into the gestalt monster, the <a href=\"/horigal/4005-66337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66337\">Horigal</a>, and together they chase away Melmoth's invaders. He later accompanies Klarion to <a href=\"/sheeda/4060-57043/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57043\">Sheeda</a>-Side, where Klarion becomes king.</p><h3>Robin</h3><p>Teekl runs away from Klarion when he senses that <a href=\"/uriah/4005-79730/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79730\">Uriah</a>, a native of Limbo Town, is in <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham</a> and creating a Judgement Beast, a chimera of familiars. He is found by <a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Robin</a>, who protects him for a short time, but he is tracked down by the Beast. Resisting for a time, he is ultimately absorbed into the Beast. He is freed when Klarion transforms them into the Horigal, and Robin breaks the spell holding the familiars together.</p><h3>Chalk (Heart) Outline</h3><p>Driven by the urge to mate but prevented by one of Klarion's spells, Teekl goes on a rampage as a were-cat, tearing out the hearts of random people he encounters. He is captured by Klarion and <a href=\"/stephanie-brown/4005-6156/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6156\">Batgirl</a>, who travel to Limbo Town and find a familiar for Teekl to mate with, ending his rampage.</p><h3>Klarion</h3><p>Apparently deceased, Teekl is sealed in a jar and carried to <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a> by Klarion. The bezoar in her stomach is used by <a href=\"/oblivion/4005-110505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-110505\">Noah</a> to open a portal that ultimately leads to Klarion's pocket, where Teekl's spirit lurks. She is ultimately revived by a spell created by Noah, and joins Klarion in defeating <a href=\"/gargora/4005-66338/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66338\">Gargora</a>.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Flashpoint</h3><p>Teekl was presumably killed in the same mysterious event that killed his master.</p><h3>Batman: The Brave and the Bold</h3><p>Teekl appears in this adaptation of the television series of the same name. She impersonates a demon as her master seeks revenge on <a href=\"/cain/4005-9646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9646\">Cain</a> and <a href=\"/abel/4005-9806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9806\">Abel</a> in the<a href=\"/the-house-of-mystery/4020-55980/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55980\"> House of Mystery</a>.</p><h3>Injustice: Gods Among Us</h3><p>Teekl appears alongside Klarion in this comic book adaptation of the video game of the same name.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Teekl has a psychic bond with her master; they can communicate by telepathy, and Klarion is able to see through her eyes. She is able to turn into a werecat, as well as to become more feral and monstrous, though these are often accomplished with Klarion's help. She also has a natural magic the exact nature of which is unknown.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><p><em><strong>The New Batman Adventures </strong></em></p><p>Teekl appears alongside Klarion in the episode \"The Demon Within.\"</p><p><em><strong>Cartoon Monsoon</strong></em></p><p>Teekl appears with Klarion in \"Trial of the Crystal Wand, Part 1 &amp; 2.\"</p><p><em><strong>Young Justice</strong></em></p><p>Teekl appears alongside Klarion, making her first appearance in \"Denial.\" She is necessary to keep Klarion tethered to this plane.

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Born Mary Creamer, the future Gimmick Girl was the daughter of \"Fly-foot\" Creamer, an acrobat who used \"human fly\" methods to commit robberies. When he was finally apprehended, he had his daughter placed in an orphanage, stipulating that she must never know her father was a criminal. Mary remained in the orphange for 10years.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-287746\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/287746-133135-merry-the-gimmick-gi.jpg\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.04\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/287746-133135-merry-the-gimmick-gi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-287746\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/287746-133135-merry-the-gimmick-gi.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/287746-133135-merry-the-gimmick-gi.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a></figure><p>And there she might have grown up had it not been for a mishap that occured while the <a href=\"/star-spangled-kid/4005-10998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10998\">Star Spangled Kid</a> and <a href=\"/stripesy/4005-30289/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30289\">Stripesy</a> were battling a gang of crooks. A bullet creased the kid's head, and while the injury was not serious, it meant that in his other identity of Sylvester Pemberton Jr, he had to wear a bandage, and since his parents were unaware of his dual ID, he had a hard time explaining.The elder Pemberton insisted on his son seeing a psychiatrist, who, noting that young Syl had no close friends or siblings, suggested the Pembertons adopt someone to be his companion. They chose Merry.</p><p>With his new sister hangins around, Syl and the family chauffer, Pat (Stripesy)Duggan, found it difficult to operate as a crime fighting team. Meanwhile, learning of the adoption, two hoods called Klinker and Buggsy went to Creamer, now out of prison and going straight as a circus performer, threatening to reveal to the Pembertons who Merry's real father was unless he helped them to pull a job. \"Fly-foot\" agreed, but he double crossed the hoods. They shot him, but just then Star Spangled Kid and Stripesy showed up. Fending off a live wire with a monogrammed handkerchief Merry had given him, the Kid got to Creamer to hear his last words, \"They wanted to hunt my girl - she's with a nice family...Pembertons! I'm an ex-con - don't tell her, help her.\" The Kid and Stripesy agreed not to tell Merry about her dad, and she never did learn. The killers died in a shoot - out with the police.</p><p>But she did hear of the hankie the Kid had used, and so learned his secret ID. She kept the secret and even made a costume for herself, in red, white and blue, like those of the KId and Stripesy. But while the Kid's outfit was mainly blue, and Stripesy's mainly red, Merry's was largely white.Merry secretly aided the Kid in capturing Presto the Magician, and it seems his gimmicks inspired her, for afterwards she was never without surprising gimmicks she created to use against villains. When Pat broke his leg battling a crook called the Rope, Merry first used her gimmicks, capturing the Rope when he had kayoyed the Kid.</p><p>Merry continued to fight crime for a while as the Girl of a thousand gimmicks, and it may have been during one of her exploits that she met Henry King (<a href=\"/brainwave/4005-9338/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9338\">Brainwave</a>). He was much older than her, but they fell in love and were married - and they had a son - Henry Jr who became the hero <a href=\"/brainwave-jr/4005-9319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9319\">Brainwave Jr</a>. in <a href=\"/infinity-inc/4060-40384/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40384\">Infinity Inc</a>. When her husband was arrested for his continual crimes, Merry had to raise Henry Jr. alone. When Henry was in his early teens, Merry succumbed to the strain she had been under for years and died at a relatively young age.</p><h2>Old Justice</h2><p>However, Merry's apeared years later as a member of <a href=\"/old-justice/4060-47253/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47253\">Old Justice</a>. The only explanation she gave for being alive was that rumors of death are often untrue.</p><p>Though she attempted to blackmail the <a href=\"/red-tornado/4005-1688/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1688\">Red Tornado</a> into helping her group shut down <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a>, she later proved that she only wanted to help the rookie heroes.</p>",

Thomas</a>. Dan shared Thomas' passion for chemistry and the two often worked on experiments after school. It was on one evening, during an experiment, that Thomas and Dunbar accidentally touched. When this occurred the two found themselves feeling extremely energized. Thomas had deduced that both of them had absorbed the chemicals that they were working with from the experiment. By touching each other, Thomas and Dunbar became charged with an unknown source of energy which gave them superhuman abilities for a brief period.</p><p>The two decided to keep their discovery a secret and become costume heroes. Thomas became known as <a href=\"/tnt/4005-61524/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61524\">T.N.T.</a> and Dunbar, Dan The Dyna-Mite. Thomas and Dunbar wore matching “Dyna-rings” that triggered a chemical reaction, which temporarily charging them with energy. Both Thomas and Dunbar would go on to join the ranks of the wartime All-Star Squadron.</p><p>It was said that TNT and Dan the Dyna-mite began to lose control of their powers, uncontrollable emitting deadly radiation. Now when they pressed rings together a devastating explosion occurred. Seeing no other choices TNT went to the bottle city of for help, while Dan the Dyna-Mite went to live in a special chamber in Atlantis.</p><h3><ins><b>Post-Crisis</b></ins></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22413/770291-tnt_dyna01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-770291\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.79003558718861\" data-width=\"281\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 281px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22413/770291-tnt_dyna01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-770291\"><img alt=\"Battling Nazis!\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22413/770291-tnt_dyna01.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22413/770291-tnt_dyna01.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\"></a><figcaption>Battling Nazis!</figcaption></figure><p>In April 1942, TNT and Dyna-Mite battled Nazi saboteurs who were attempting to blow up a dam in Colorado . When the saboteurs fled in a car, the pair gave chase in their own automobile. The saboteurs had fired upon the two heroes with one of the bullets hitting the tire of T.N.T.’s auto. The auto crashed and burst into flames. The young hero Iron Munro, who happened to be nearby, pulled TNT and Dyna-Mite from the wreckage. TNT was dead, and his spirit was carried off by the Valkyrie called <a href=\"/gundra/4005-30277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30277\">Gudra</a> (a member of <a href=\"/axis-amerika/4060-50511/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50511\">Axis Amerika</a>). Munro took Dyna-Mite to a hospital, where he soon recovered from his injuries.</p><p>Still grief-stricken over T.N.T.’s death, Dyna-Mite manages to pull himself together when President Franklin Roosevelt requested him to join six other young members of the All-Star Squadron on a cross-country tour to encourage the buying of War Bonds. The seven heroes would soon be known as the Young All-Stars. With T.N.T’s death, Dyna-mite believed he could no longer access his super-powers, but soon discovered he still could by wearing both rings and pressing them together.</p><h3><ins><b>An Aging Hero</b></ins></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/167292-177121-dyna-mite.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-167292\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.392\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/167292-177121-dyna-mite.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-167292\"><img alt=\"Dyna-Mite reconnects with his powers.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/167292-177121-dyna-mite.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/167292-177121-dyna-mite.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dyna-Mite reconnects with his powers.\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/167292-177121-dyna-mite.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/167292-177121-dyna-mite.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dyna-Mite reconnects with his powers.</figcaption></figure><p>Like some heroes of the War Era, Dyna-Mite became but just a footnote in the public eye. He would reappear, now in his “golden years”, to team up with his former teammate, Neptune Perkins (now a Senator). Dyna-Mite was advocating against the existence of teen super-hero teams and the reckless behavior of them, mostly notably the team Young Justice. He even formed his own group based off the youthful team called <a href=\"/old-justice/4060-47253/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47253\">Old Justice</a>. The team consisted of <a href=\"/merry-the-gimmick-girl/4005-11982/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11982\">Merry the Gimmick Girl</a>, <a href=\"/doiby-dickles/4005-18365/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18365\">Doiby Dickles</a>, Sweep Second, and the Cyclones.</p><p>A rally in DC over the above issue occurs, which leads to many adult heroes turning into their younger selves and Young Justice turning into adult heroes. Old Justice, unaffected by the turn of events, finds themselves supervising the chaotic crowd of young heroes with the aid of the adult Young Justice members. Temporary working out of the JLA headquarters in , the heroes discover <a href=\"/klarion/4005-11976/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11976\">Klarion the Witch Boy</a> was behind the recent transformations. The heroes are faced to deal with Klarion, other younger super-villains and some magically created monsters. After a terrific final battle, Klarion is coerced into restoring the proper ages of the affected heroes. In the end, Old Justice realizes that Young Justice are worthy heroes in their own right.</p><h3><ins><strong>Legacy</strong></ins></h3><p>Depiste the mantle of Dyna-Mite and TNT has not be passed, other characters had appeared with shared characterstics: <a href=\"/dyno-mite-dan/4005-66677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66677\">Dyno-Mite Dan</a>, from the Seven Soldiers and <a href=\"/tnteena/4005-58370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58370\">TNTeena</a>, Teen Titans candidate.

    "deck": "First appearing in World's Finest Comics, Bonnie King attempted to become yet another sidekick for the emerald archer. She became a trusted ally of Green Arrow's over the years. She is the mother of the second Arrowette who joined Young Justice.",
    "description": "<p>Due to the constant, grueling <a href=\"/archery/4015-56547/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56547\">archery</a> training from her mother, Millie, Bonnie actually became a good archer in her own right, even so far as to go on to win a Bronze Medal in the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/olympic-games/4015-56361/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56361\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olympic Games</a>. To her mother, though, anything short of gold was a disappointment. After that, Bonnie abandoned home and archery (for a period of time) never to talk to her mother again. This would later explain the strained relationship that she and her own daughter would have.</p><p> </p><p>During her stay in <a href=\"/star-city/4020-47878/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-47878\">Star City</a>, she eventually became inspired by the exploits of <a href=\"/green-arrow-and-speedy/4060-61536/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61536\">Green Arrow and Speedy</a>, and after becoming queen at the National Archery Convention and being crowned the annual Miss Arrowette, King fashions a costume for herself, becoming the first Miss Arrowette, in hopes of using her skills for something more meaningful. Against the other two archer's pleas, she attempted to help then, but it turned out that she was quite clumsy and too vain to wear a mask.</p><p> </p><p>Bonnie briefly dated Oliver Queen, but later <a href=\"/marriage/4015-56090/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56090\">married</a> journalist <a href=\"/bernell-jones/4005-113248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-113248\">Bernell \"Bowstring\" Jones</a>, who remembered her from the Olympic Games and, flatteringly enough, considered her a star. Eventually, Green Arrow asked Bonnie not to assist them anymore. This event seemed almost as a precursor, announcing the coming end of Bonnie's short lived career. Shortly after, She had to permanently leave archery because of carpal tunnel syndrome in her wrists.</p><p> </p><p>Before \"Bowstring\" died a few years after their marriage, Bonnie had a daughter named <a href=\"/arrowette/4005-1685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1685\">Cissie King-Jones</a>, who later became Arrowette, under mother's guidance and training.</p><p> </p><p>Bonnie forced her daughter, Cissie, into archery like her mother did to her and forced her into a life of crime fighting. Cissie and her mother's relationship is very strained.</p><p> </p><p>Trick arrows- Arrowette's trick arrows take a more feminine gear with arrows such as the mascara arrow and nail file arrow. Yet these arrows have gotten her, Green Arrow and Speedy out of quite a few sticky situations. </p><p><a href=\"/trick-arrow/4055-55833/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55833\">Trick Arrows</a> used:</p><ol><li>Bubble Arrow</li><li>Hair Pin Arrow</li><li>Lotion Arrow</li><li>Hair Tint Arrow</li><li>Nail File Arrow</li><li>Needle and Thread Arrow</li><li>Powder-Puff Arrow</li><li>Hair Net Arrow</li><li>Kerchief Arrow</li><li>Mascara Arrow</li><li>Mirror Arrow</li></ol>",

She teamed up with Reginald Hackman (aka <a href=\"/hackrat/4005-74769/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74769\"> Hackrat</a>), Carter Channel (aka <a href=\"/channelman/4005-11987/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11987\"> Channelman</a>), Cullen Thrane (aka Output), and Michael Wasko (aka Mega-Biter) and formed the Psyba-Rats to steal data and perform industrial espionage. The Psyba-Rats were hired by the Collector to break into Wayne Enterprises. <a href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\"> Robin</a> appeared on the scene, and scared them off. When they updated their status to the Collector, he killed Thrane and Wasko. Sharp, Hackman, and Channel fled, and ran into the <a href=\"/bloodlines/4045-40645/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40645\"> Bloodlines</a> parasites during their Earthbreak. The three were all attacked by<a href=\"/venev/4005-12928/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12928\"> Venev</a>, an alien parasite, whose venom activated their meta-gene. As a result of this meta-gene activation, Sharp gained the ability to transform her limbs into blades, sharp enough to cut through almost anything.</p><p> </p><p>Now super-powered, the remaining Psyba-Rats planned their revenge on the Collector. Channelman, using his new ability to enter television systems, disabled the Collector's security while Razorsharp and Hackrat broke in. Robin, on the trail of the Psyba-Rats, followed them to the Collector's operation, and confronted Razorsharp and Hackrat. Robin joined the Psyba-Rats to confront the Collector, and during the fight the Collector threw Robin out the window of the skyrise. Razorsharp jumped out after him, and saved him using her base jump parachute. Deciding they'd had enough for the night, they part ways, but not before naming Robin an honorary Psyba-Rat.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1714122\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1714122-391344_9220_130467_1_robin_annual_super.gif\" data-ratio=\"1.54\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1714122-391344_9220_130467_1_robin_annual_super.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1714122\"><img alt=\" Robin Annual #2\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1714122-391344_9220_130467_1_robin_annual_super.gif\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1714122-391344_9220_130467_1_robin_annual_super.gif 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px\" data-width=\"415\"></a><figcaption> Robin Annual #2</figcaption></figure><p>Razorsharp was one of the heroes created for the <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\"> DC Comics</a> 1993 crossover event <a href=\"/bloodlines/4045-40645/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40645\"> Bloodlines</a>.

In another job, the Psyba-Rats went up against both <a href=\"/catwoman/4005-1698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1698\"> Catwoman</a> and Robin while trying to rob the estate of deceased insane billionaire C.

During the Pack's first outing against the <a href=\"/demolition-team/4060-55812/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55812\"> Demolition Team</a>, Razorsharp and fellow Packmate <a href=\"/geist/4005-32657/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32657\"> Geist</a> discovered that the fight was not staged. Razorsharp shared her concerns about Wunderkind Media to Loria, who was killed trying to find out their secret.</p><p> </p><p>While digging further, Razorsharp discovered evidence that the producers of the Blood Pack were using illegal alien technology. Razorsharp was confronted by one of the <a href=\"/darkstars/4060-25039/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25039\"> Darkstars</a>, who was searching for the alien technology. Razorsharp discovered that all of the Blood Pack's actions were manipulated as part of another alien invasion. Razorsharp filled in the rest of the Pack, but the Pack was attacked by the producer's guards. The Pack escaped, and contacted the New Titans, but were cut off before they could warn them. The Pack regrouped, then broke into the Wunderkind Media's operation. They rescued the captured <a href=\"/jade/4005-3406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3406\"> Jade</a>, and defeated the alien invasion. The Pack then went their separate ways, and Razorsharp returned to her Psyba-Rat friends.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Infinite Crisis and Darkest Night</h3><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1552595\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1552595-281px_black_lantern_razorsharp.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5017793594306\" data-width=\"281\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 281px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1552595-281px_black_lantern_razorsharp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1552595\"><img alt=\"Razorsharp as a Black Lantern\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1552595-281px_black_lantern_razorsharp.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1552595-281px_black_lantern_razorsharp.jpg 281w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Razorsharp as a Black Lantern\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1552595-281px_black_lantern_razorsharp.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83392/1552595-281px_black_lantern_razorsharp.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Razorsharp as a Black Lantern</figcaption></figure><p>During the <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\"> Infinite Crisis</a>, the <a href=\"/secret-society-of-super-villains/4060-40433/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40433\"> Secret Society</a> organized multiple jailbreaks across the world while the majority of the big hitters were wrapped up with the crisis. <a href=\"/oracle/4005-5368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\"> Oracle</a> and <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\"> J'onn J'onzz</a> reached out to every hero, retired or not, to help with the wave of villains spreading across the globe.

When the alien affliction hits Pine Ridge she has an estranged relationship with <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/gunfire/4005-57114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57114\">Blake</a>; a local cop whose car she's working on, like many residents of the town she too incurs the sickness giving everyone infected with octane capabilities. Having once injured a pub goer who was hitting on her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>From the activation of her Meta-Gene, Razorsharp gained the ability to morph her arms and legs into blades of organic steel. These blades carry a sharp edge, allowing her to slice through various materials, including steel, glass, and many other materials. Razorsharp can also use the blades to allow her to climb buildings by piercing the walls and using them as pitons, as well as to stabilize herself in difficult terrain. The organic steel of her blades are capable of deflecting bullets from a high-powered rifle.</p><p>Razorsharp is an expert hacker, and has navigated her way through many computer systems and communications networks. She has learned how to pilot an airship from her time with the Blood Pack. She is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and an excellent sprinter.</p><p>In the New 52's run of bloodlines Razorsharp's powers revolve around a limited form of ferrokinesis. Instead of morphing limbs into blade edges, she now can morph the bodily piercings lined all along her body into elongated skein's with which to hack and tear into her enemies with. Given the composition of her metal she cut slice though stone, steel and flesh with ease.</p><p>Razorsharp also has some limited hand 2 hand capabilities which further the lethality of her metalmorphing abilities, to the extent of which she can manipulate metals is uncertain. Haley's also an auto-mechanic having a job at a body shop knowing her way around a motorized vehicle like a car or motorcycle.     </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>Razorsharp wears her standard-issue Psyba-Rats outfit, which includes a backpack and various pockets on her waist, arms, and legs. In this suit, she carries a large amount of peripheral electronics equipment, including a wireless headset for communication with the other Psyba-Rats, extra discs and external hard drives, cables, and various other electronic equipment.</p>",

    "deck": "Channelman gained the power to travel into the world of television by the Bloodlines aliens. He was a founding member of the Psyba-Rats.",
    "description": "<p>Carter Channel (aka Channelman) was first seen as a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57962\" href=\"/psyba-rats/4060-57962/\" slug=\"psyba-rats\">       Psyba-Rats</a>, a group of  teenage techno thieves. He teamed up with Raelene  \"Rae\" Sharp (aka <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11986\" href=\"/razorsharp/4005-11986/\" slug=\"razorsharp\">      Razorsharp</a>), Reginald Hackman (aka <a href=\"../../hackrat/29-74769/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                            Hackrat</a>), Cullen Thrane (aka Output), and Michael Wasko (aka Mega-Biter) and  formed the Psyba-Rats to steal data and perform industrial espionage.  The Psyba-Rats were hired by the Collector to break into Wayne  Enterprises. <a href=\"../../robin/29-1687/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                         Robin</a>  appeared on the scene, and scared them off. When they updated their  status to the Collector, he killed Thrane and Wasko. Sharp, Hackman, and  Channel fled, and ran into the <a href=\"../../bloodlines/39-40645/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                          Bloodlines</a>  parasites during their Earthbreak. The three were all attacked by  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12928\" href=\"/venev/4005-12928/\" slug=\"venev\">     Venev</a>, an alien parasite, whose venom activated their meta-gene. As a  result of this meta-gene activation, Channel gained the ability to \"enter\" into a television world, inhabiting the characteristics of that world. He could travel the television airwaves to appear on any TV. <br/> <br/>Now  super-powered, the remaining Psyba-Rats planned their revenge on the  Collector. Channelman, using his new ability to enter television  systems, disabled the Collector's security while Razorsharp and Hackrat  broke in. Robin, on the trail of the Psyba-Rats, followed them to the  Collector's operation, and confronted Razorsharp and Hackrat. Robin  joined the Psyba-Rats to confront the Collector, and during the fight  the Collector threw Robin out the window of the skyrise. Razorsharp  jumped out after him, and saved him using her base jump parachute.  Deciding they'd had enough for the night, they part ways, but not before  naming Robin an honorary Psyba-Rat.  <br/>  <br/>Channelman and the Psyba-Rats continued to perform various acts of data retrieval  and urban infiltration. They broke into the compound of billionaire T.  Clyde Pontefract to earn themselves a million dollars. They also stole  the fabled formula for Zesti Cola for a mysterious Mr. Branchwater; a  mission that brought them into conflict with the Collector again.  During this mission, Channelman's body was killed by Mr. Branchwater's goons, but his consciousness still exists floating on the television airwaves. <br/> <br/>At one point, the Psyba-Rats accepted the job to break into the defunct <a href=\"../../secret-sanctuary/34-56257/\" rel=\"nofollow\">          Justice League Secret Sanctuary</a> (but currently being used by <a href=\"../../young-justice/65-17733/\" rel=\"nofollow\">         Young Justice</a>)  and retrieve all data related to the \"Magellan Files.\" The Rats did not  realize that A) Robin was on the team and B) their mysterious client  was <a href=\"../../blockbuster/29-8263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">        Blockbuster</a>. After the Psyba-Rats took down <a href=\"../../red-tornado/29-1688/\" rel=\"nofollow\">       Red Tornado</a>, <a href=\"../../arrowette/29-1685/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Arrowette</a>, and <a href=\"../../secret/29-1682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">     Secret</a>, Robin and <a href=\"../../superboy/29-1686/\" rel=\"nofollow\">    Superboy</a>  arrived. Robin and Razorsharp compared notes, and both groups (Young  Justice and the Psyba-Rats) turned on Blockbuster, invading his computer  system with a custom Young Justice virus.</p>",

It's a Secret!</figcaption></figure><p>He began cataloging information of superheroes and their weaknesses into his own \"Book of Blood\" and searching for a way to acquire superpowers of his own. He ultimately succeeded by contacting the demon <a href=\"/buzz/4005-10927/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10927\">Buzz</a> and he would kill his own sister, Greta in demonic bargain to gain power in exchange. Unknowingly, he condemned Greta to become <a href=\"/secret/4005-1682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1682\">Secret</a>; as her soul was too pure to be cast into Hell and yet due to the manner of her death in a demonic ritual, Greta was unable to pass into Heaven.</p><p>Instead, she was effectively \"stuck\" in this plane of existence as a <i>Warder</i>; a being who was not quite alive, not quite dead, and yet a gateway into both the spheres of Heaven and Hell. Severely traumatized by her brutal death, Greta lost most of her memories and was contained by the <a href=\"/deo/4060-47222/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47222\">D.E.O</a>. She later escaped custody from the D.E.O. who attempted to trick <a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Robin</a>, <a href=\"/bart-allen/4005-1680/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1680\">Impulse</a>, and <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a> into apprehending her for them. Upon discovering that she was not the mindless monster that the D.E.O. had proclaimed her to be and their intentions to experiment upon her, the trio secretly conspired to make it appear that she was destroyed and allowed her to make her own way in the world, free of being hunted by the D.E.O. This misadventure bonded the youthful heroes as friends and ultimately leading them to forming <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile now armed with superpowers, Billy would reveal his sociopathic tendencies to his parents, effectively terrorizing them as he began his training in earnest to become the world's greatest supervillain. When his father tried to discipline him, Billy reprimanded him by nearly severing his jugular. When Billy finally believed he was ready several years later; he took the name of Harm and decided to test himself by killing superheroes of his own age, believing it would be good practice for when he would challenge their elders.</p><p>After discovering the secret identity of <a href=\"/arrowette/4005-1685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1685\">Arrowette</a>, he lured her into a trap and when she shot at him; he caught her arrow and threw it back, impaling her in the shoulder with her own weapon. Contemptuously, he left her alive to serve as a warning and as a sinister message to all of teenage superheroes, <i>\"to stay out of Harm's way\"</i>. She was found by the <a href=\"/super-cycle/4005-70704/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70704\">Supercycle</a> who brought her to the <a href=\"/secret-sanctuary/4020-56257/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56257\">Secret Sanctuary</a> (then serving as the headquarters of <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a>) for aid, prompting the members of Young Justice to hunt down and apprehend Arrowette's attacker.</p><p>Harm had decided to continue his rampage by attacking <a href=\"/wonder-girl/4005-10885/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10885\">Wonder Girl</a> and was surprised when <a href=\"/secret/4005-1682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1682\">Secret</a> appeared and when she tried to stop him, he promptly electrocuted her. Subsequently, he remarked that she looked vaguely familiar for some reason. Even the appearance of <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a> was unable to turn the tide in their favor as the Boy of Steel was gassed into unconsciousness.</p><p>Harm next broke into the <a href=\"/secret-sanctuary/4020-56257/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56257\">Secret Sanctuary</a> where he skewered the <a href=\"/red-tornado/4005-1688/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1688\">Red Tornado</a> and then reprogrammed the android to serve him, forcing <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a> to rescue their erstwhile mentor while simultaneously trying to foil Harm's attempt to kill Pope John Paul II. He then proceeded to defeat <a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Robin</a>, and it was only through the assistance of a recovered <a href=\"/arrowette/4005-1685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1685\">Arrowette</a> that saved the Boy Wonder from Harm who fled in the confusion.</p><p>Confronted afterward by his father who had seen his actions on television, Harm mocked him for his inability to stop him and was surprised when his tearful father took out a gun and shot him; believing that it was the only way that he could prevent Harm from hurting other people. And so Harm died, apparently ending his reign of terror once and for all.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22385/403968-63802-harm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-403968\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1440677966102\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22385/403968-63802-harm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-403968\"><img alt=\"Return from the Grave\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22385/403968-63802-harm.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22385/403968-63802-harm.png 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px\" data-width=\"354\"></a><figcaption>Return from the Grave</figcaption></figure><p>However, this was not the end for Harm. During the <a href=\"/day-of-judgment/4045-55661/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55661\">Day of Judgment</a>, Harm was among the dead souls who escaped from Hell and promptly attacked and defeated <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a> once more. On the verge of Harm's victory, <a href=\"/secret/4005-1682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1682\">Secret</a> recalled her horrifying death and with it; the realization that Harm was actually her brother Billy and that he had killed her years ago. In a fit of rage, Secret launched herself at him and crashing them into a mountainside. The tremendous impact created an avalanche and burying brother and sister under tons of rubble. Despite an extensive search by Young Justice to find Harm's body, he was never found.</p><p>Harm's next complex plot saw him attempting to enhance his supernatural powers. He first freed <a href=\"/rip-roar/4005-11993/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11993\">Rip Roar</a> from his imprisonment and then allied himself with <a href=\"/annie-mae/4005-76737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76737\">Annie Mae</a> under the identity of REMbrant by offering her revenge on <a href=\"/spyboy/4005-46801/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46801\">Spyboy</a>, <a href=\"/spygirl/4005-61656/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61656\">Spygirl</a>, and <a href=\"/bombshell/4005-46804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46804\">Bombshell</a>. Combining her technology with his hellspawn magics, Harm created a series of Super-Deformed Agents by tapping the inner subconsciousness of Spyboy and his friends as well as <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a>. These miniature versions wrecked havoc and sowed the seeds of suspicion and distrust between the two groups. Harm then betrayed Annie Mae by using the Super-Deformed to launch a terrorist attack at the Zenith Conference in Tokyo, intending to trigger a collapse of a Hell-Hole and collapse all of Tokyo into it, including Young Justice. By linking himself to the Hell-Hole, Harm would have gained unimaginable power with it's accelerated growth.</p><p>However, Harm's newest servant <a href=\"/rip-roar/4005-11993/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11993\">Rip Roar</a> proved to be no match for Annie Mae's associate, <a href=\"/slackjaw/4005-76738/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76738\">Slackjaw</a> and <a href=\"/annie-mae/4005-76737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76737\">Annie Mae</a> turned the tables on Harm by alerting <a href=\"/secret/4005-1682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1682\">Secret</a> to his plan. Harm's scheme was foiled when the rest of <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a> were able to derail their miniatures and prevent the mass panic which would have accelerated the Hell-Hole's collapse. Secret teleported <a href=\"/spyboy/4005-46801/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46801\">Spyboy</a> to Annie Mae's secret submarine headquarters where Spyboy stabbed a weakened Harm with his own sword and sent him back to Hell.</p><p>Harm next managed to escape from Hell as a disembodied spirit. Ironically, he would possess his adopted father, Burt Hayes' body who was sentenced to death for shooting and killing Harm himself. <a href=\"/secret/4005-1682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1682\">Secret</a>, having regained her lost memories sought to reconcile with her father. Harm instead would psychologically devastate her by having Burt reject her by proclaiming her as a monster. Despite this, Secret was unwilling to allow her father to be executed and broke him out of prison with the help of her teammate <a href=\"/slobo/4005-46872/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46872\">Slobo</a>. This incident turned the rest of <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a> against her. Believing herself cut off from all of her friends and in despair, <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a> would offer her sanctuary on <a href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\">Apokolips</a>, relocating her and her \"father\".</p><p>During her time on <a href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\">Apokolips</a>, Harm would force Burt to commit suicide, apparently further driving <a href=\"/secret/4005-1682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1682\">Secret</a> into <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a>'s clutches. Harm has not made his presence known since.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Originally, Harm possessed superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes. The exact limits of these abilities are unknown but he was able to hold his own against Superboy and Wonder Girl briefly.</p><p>In addition, he possesses a tremendous intellect and apparently was responsible for creating his own costume which included body armor and the ability to use his cape for limited gliding as well. Harm possessed extensive knowledge and research on superhumans, particularly superheroes. His technical abilities included computer hacking and he was able to actually reprogram the Red Tornado. He was highly skilled in strategy, tactics, and psychological warfare.</p><p>He wielded a customized sword that contained a miniature chemical sprayer that was loaded with a knock-out chemical able to neutralize Superboy and drove a customized car that was armored, faster than conventional vehicles, and could deploy a grappling hook.</p><p>He demonstrated extraordinary fighting skills in both hand to hand combat and swordsmanship.</p><p>After his death, Harm gained supernatural powers and abilities and was apparently even more powerful than he was in life. Further, he also possessed necromantic abilities which gave him the ability to command the dead and spirits. Under certain conditions such as special supernatural rituals or events, his necromantic abilities were increased or could be augmented. Harm possessed certain limitations towards remaining on the physical plane due to his state as an undead entity and could even be banished.</p><p>Harm also demonstrated the ability to cast magical spells and perform certain arcane rituals and apparently gained extensive knowledge about supernatural spellcasting and magic.</p><p>He later learned how to possess a physical body and control it; allowing him to bypass his former limitation on remaining in the living world. Although this may have been limited due to his connection to his adopted father and how his father was responsible for killing him, as he never demonstrated the ability to possess other people.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>Harm appears in the Young Justice episode \"Secrets\" voiced by Benjamin Diskin. In this appearance Harm speaks in the third person and referred to Artemis &amp; Zatanna as \"they\" or \"it\". </p><p>Harm recognizes Secret immediately and is obviously shaken when she appears. When Artemis and Zatanna find Greta's grave in the back yard, Artemis rages at him for seeming proud of killing his sister and having the gall to write \"beloved\" on her grave. Harm replies that it wasn't gall but truth. \"She was the only thing Harm ever loved. That's why she had to go. Harm's heart had to be pure, Greta had to be cut out. Excised like an infection.\"</p><p>When confronted by his sister's ghost Harm panics and yells that his heart is pure and he isn't sorry, switching mid sentence from speaking in the third person to speaking in the first person. Secret reaches into his chest and takes his powers, after which Artemis is easily able to defeat him in hand to hand combat.</p><p>He is the only known villain faced by YJ who had no connections to \"The Light\".</p>",

    "description": "<p>Many eons ago, the four-armed juggernaut known as Rip Roar was dispatched along with his hated rival Kalibak the Cruel, to plunder tribute for their master Darkseid. Rip Roar stole a Super-Cycle from New Genesis, home of the New Gods who opposed Darkseid. Rip Roar bonded with this sentient vehicle and rode roughshod over several worlds in Daekseid's name. Knowing that his father would greatly approve of Rip Roar's acts of wanton destruction, Kalibak convinced Darkseid's underling Desaad to sabotage Rip Roar's teleporting Boom Tube. Through this intervention, Rip Roar ended up encased inside a mountain on Earth until he was accidentally released by the team known as Young Justice. Following a battle between the young heroes and Rip Roar, the beast from Apokoloips ended up covered in molten lava. The Department of Extranormal Operations then recovered the warrior and he remains in custody for now.</p>",

    "description": "<p> <br/> <br/>Donald Fite along with his partner Ishido hounded the team Young Justice during its early days. Eventually Donald introduced his daughter Anita (Empress) to the team and it was later revealed he did this because he knew she was Empress. He encouraged the friendship between Anita and the team and was glad that she was helping others. He was killed by Baron Agua Sin Gaaz while on a mission with Ishido in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was left tied up in a cabin after being beaten by Baron's Antibodies which exploded. Secret said he was dead before the explosion and when Anita reached him she said he wasn't breathing, so he was most likely dead because Secret would be able to know being a warder. Anita  along with Robin, Slo-Bo and The Ray went into Secret to try and save him, but he said it was his time and he had to go on. Through Baron Sin Gaaz's experiments of turning people back into babies and going through life again, Donald was able to come back as a baby along with his wife when their soul's escaped out of Secret. Anita then began to care for him and her mother.      <br/></p><h2>Trivia<br/></h2>Agent Fite's name (as well as his partner's) are a deliberate pun on writer <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40682\" href=\"/peter-david/4040-40682/\" slug=\"peter-david\"> Peter David</a>'s part of the phrase, <i>\"Fighting Mad.\"</i>",

    "deck": "Once a normal human named Nina Dowd, she was transformed into the catgirl Mighty Endowed upon touching an artifact she found on an archeological dig.",
    "description": "<h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><p>On an archeological dig, Nina Dowd and her assistant came across a metallic object half-buried amongst the rocks of the dig site. On touching it, Doctor Dowd was bound up in a cocoon and her assistant called for help. One of those responding groups proved to be the newly-formed <a href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\">Young Justice</a>, consisting of <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a>, <a href=\"/bart-allen/4005-1680/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1680\">Impulse</a>, and <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Robin</a>. Doctor Dowd was freed from her crystalline cocoon by Impulse, who vibrated it to pieces, releasing the newly transformed doctor. No longer a normal human, she had become a being that now called herself Mighty Endowed. Now a catgirl in appearance, she also had increased the size of her breasts. Her ego swelled with power, she considered all those she saw to be beneath and was not threatened by the presence of Young Justice. Unfortunately for the eager Superboy, Mighty Endowed defeated herself by the size of her assets; their weight made her fall over and unable to move.</p><p>Following her \"defeat\" at the hands of Young Justice, Dr. Dowd was promptly turned over to the All-Purpose Enforcement Squad (A.P.E.S), who relocated her to their base within Mount Rushmore to be detained until she could be treated by the Department of Extra-normal Operations (D.E.O.) or S.T.A.R. Labs, who had more experience in treating metahumans and natives of both New Genesis and Apokalips due to their past history with Superman. However, during the course of her incarceration, she managed to use her hypnotic endowment to enthrall a duo of agents into aiding her in an escape attempt. Though she managed to stun multiple agents during the course of her attempted flight from the facility, Agents Donald Fite and Ishido Madd managed to rein her back in by knocking the agents she had been puppeting unconscious, rendering their effectiveness as counterweight/support for her sizable assets moot, and causing her to fall over just as before.</p><p>She was promptly recaptured and outfitted with proper restraints to ensure the hypnotic effect caused by her breasts would be nullified, preventing any further escape attempts. While her ultimate fate is unknown, at the time, multiple research teams from multiple agencies had made their desire to study her and create a cure known to both the DEO and APES, hoping to undo the effects of the Super-Cycle's genetic tampering.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Prior to her transformation, Nina Dowd possessed no superhuman abilities, and was for the most part an average human. She was, however, a highly competent archaeologist, and had an in-depth knowledge of ancient cultures and peoples. Physically, she possessed the same stamina, agility, reflexes, and strength of a normal human woman who engaged in regular vigorous exercise.</p><p>Thanks to the genetic augmentation she was subject to through a defense mechanism built into the Super-Cycle via New God technologies, however, Nina promptly gained superhuman abilities on par with those natives of both New Genesis and Apokalips, making her the first human to be fully transformed into a New God. She possesses all of the standard abilities of the New Gods, such as superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, and durability. Her already enhanced senses are magnified by the cat-like characteristics of her new form, and she seems to possess an significant healing factor that not only heals wounds and shortens recuperation, but retards the aging process.</p><p>As the Mighty Endowed, Nina possesses a unique superhuman ability tied to her namesake. Thanks to the Super-Cycle's genetic tampering, her bust size was increased to ridiculous proportions, and made the source of her secondary abilities. She seems to be able to emit a hypnotic light from her breasts, enchanting anyone who stares at them for too long and making them into her willing puppets. The hypnotic effect appears to be absolute, and only wears off once her new minions are far enough away from the light, or rendered unconscious. The light can also be projected as a blinding strobe to disorient her opponents.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p>While her \"incredible headlights\" are her best weapon, they are in fact a double-edged sword. As the Mighty Endowed, the weight from Nina's enhanced bust is far too great for her to stand on her own or move of her own accord for extended periods of time without their weight causing her to topple over, leaving her in a vulnerable position where she is unable to move, almost like a tortoise on it's back. This is possibly why she possesses her hypnotic abilities, which she first used to enthrall a pair of APES agents into acting as supports for her to steady herself against. However, once they were knocked out, Mighty Endowed toppled to the floor once more, unable to stand with the weight of her bosom drawing her down. Even when she was being escorted by to her holding cell, she had to lean on the accompanying agent to keep from falling over.</p><p>Likewise, her hypnotic abilities are not entirely absolute, as mentioned above. Whenever someone is a certain distance away from her, they can resist the Mighty Endowed's mind-control to a certain degree. Also, so long as they do not look directly at her while she is using her abilities, they can effectively defeat her without fear of becoming one of her puppets. This was how Agent's Fite and Madd were able to bring her into custody after her attempted escape from APES, ricocheting their plasma-rifles' blasts off of the walls of the facility to knock out her puppets.</p><p>It can be also be assumed that, due to her transformation at the genetic and sub-atomic levels by the Super-Cycle, that the Mighty Endowed also carries the same weaknesses inherent to the New Gods, such as a vulnerability to Radion.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Yorick Brown was an amateur magician and escape artist, in love with his girlfriend, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43842\" href=\"/beth-deville/4005-43842/\" slug=\"beth-deville\">Beth</a>, and training the monkey <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11999\" href=\"/ampersand/4005-11999/\" slug=\"ampersand\">Ampersand</a>, to do domestic chores for quadriplegics, when the plague hit. Every male creature on Earth died a sudden, bloody, death simultaneously that day...except for Yorick and Ampersand. Yorick sets off to find Beth, who is in Australia, meeting up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40437\" href=\"/agent-355/4005-40437/\" slug=\"agent-355\">Agent 355</a> of the secret Culper Ring and cloning expert <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43816\" href=\"/allison-mann/4005-43816/\" slug=\"allison-mann\">Dr. Allison Mann</a>, both of whom see humanity's last hope in Yorick.</p><p>Yorick's attitude is characteristically witty, and he often prioritizes opportunities for clever quips over his own safety. It is later revealed that Yorick in fact has something of a death wish when a former Culper Ring agent and friend of 355 interrogates him in a seeming S&amp;M domination scenario. This reveals some of Yorick's underlying depth, as do his apparent hang ups about sex in a seeming paradise of willing women.</p><p>It has been revealed that the only reason that he has survived the plague is that he handled his pet monkey Ampersand's feces (who was a former test monkey) and gave him a resistance to the plague.</p><p>He has also fathered a daughter since the plague hit, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67004\" href=\"/beth-jr/4005-67004/\" slug=\"beth-jr\">Beth Jr.</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>Agent Orange is a super powered killing machine created by the FBI. Instead of blood, Agent Orange has a substance called dioxin flowing through his veins. Dioxin is a chemical substance that normally causes a wide range of organ and metabolic dysfunctions, but not in Agent Orange. He thrives on it and it makes him super strong, extremely durable, faster than a speeding vehicle, and able to heal from wounds that would kill a normal man. The only weapons he uses are two handguns, but he's also a skilled fighter. He doesn't speak but he knows how to kill people, and he's good at it. In issues 20 and 21 of WildC.A.T.S volume 2, he was ordered to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21968\" href=\"/maul/4005-21968/\">Maul</a>. He fought <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23624\" href=\"/grifter/4005-23624/\">Grifter</a> and almost beat him to death but Maul stopped him by activating a self-destruct device that was put into him by the FBI. He was believed to be dead after this, but a year later he was found to be alive. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12006\" href=\"/spartan/4005-12006/\">Spartan</a> took him and reprogrammed his mind so Orange would work for him.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p><b>Superhuman Strength-</b> orange has enhanced levels of strength greater than the finest athlete, great enough to warp and break steel apart with his bear hands, man handle a full grown adult be them male or female and could easily rupture bone and sinew with but a couple of blows.</p><p><b>Superhuman Speed-</b> He's fast enough to catch opponents off guard in battle or able to keep up with moving vehicles for a short period of time.</p><p><b>Nigh-Invulnerability-</b> able to take several gunshots from light or heavy artillery to his frame with little to no injury as well as have a grenade explode in his face and walk away from it just barely singed. He can even survive falls from great heights while landing on steel reinforced transportation without so much as breaking bones or rending ligaments.</p><p><b>Healing Factor-</b> Orange also sports a light healing factor that allows him to recover from moderate to fatal injuries in a matter of hours.</p><p>He's also very robotic in his nature, he lacks much of a personality but Agent Orange is a devout soldier who follows orders when told to the letter with little to even no regard for his own well being. At most the only expressions he ever shows are only becoming mildly annoyed when following through with a task. Due to his Impressionable state of mind he can be programmed and reprogrammed with all kinds of instructions and commands.</p><h2><b>Abilities</b></h2><p>Orange is an accomplished F.B.I Agent; liked even by his superiors despite his eerie solemn nature. As F.B.I he's also A well learned CQC (closed quarters combat) specialist who can go toe to toe with even the most deadly of adversaries, namely those of the Coda sisterhood of Assassins. Not to mention he's a crack shot not unlike the Grifter, with is two heavyset Twin Colt Revolvers.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p>Agent orange had a fail safe trigger within his homing brain-chip implant that would deliver a special signal to shut him down if he ever became a threat to his superiors, initially it would send a potent neuro-shock to his system that he had a less than .01% chance of surviving in the past.</p>",

Growing up like most of the Pantheon, Yon was trained to be a warrior from birth. The creatures he learned to fight against were the <a href=\"/daemonites/4060-41061/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41061\">Daemonites</a>, his races sworn enemy. He became a war lord that was so respected that his body was used as the template for the Spartan Guards (see <a href=\"/kherubim-technology/4015-41622/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41622\">Kherubim Technology</a>). Some thousands of years ago, Yon was aboard a Kherubim vessel that found itself locked in battle with a Daemonite ship in the space above Earth. The ships battled fiercely and both were damaged and crashed to the planet. Over the next thousands of years, the Kherubim-Daemonite war continued, but both sides began to blend in with the humans that surrounded them (Kherubim looked human and Daemonites could shape shift and steal bodies) and their battles became less and less visible.</p><p>In the 1930's Yon Kohl changed his name to John Colt and began a career as an adventurer and an American Hero. His abilities weren't as great as some other Kherubim on Earth (like <a href=\"/mr-majestic/4005-21972/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21972\">Mr. Majestic</a>) so many believed he was just a normal man, his abilities no more than anyone could acquire if they trained, persevered, believed in themselves, and believed in the nation. He was major John Colt, a normal American serving his country. He was a super patriot, the <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> of the <a href=\"/wildstorm-universe/4015-41583/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41583\">Wildstorm Universe</a>. Because of this, he was chosen to be a member of a special team built to stop an alien menace.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56044/1630022-wildcats_covert_action_teams__1992__1n_newsstand.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1630022\" data-ratio=\"1.5504587155963\" data-width=\"3924\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3924px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.0%\" href=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56044/1630022-wildcats_covert_action_teams__1992__1n_newsstand.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1630022\"><img alt=\"Issue #1\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56044/1630022-wildcats_covert_action_teams__1992__1n_newsstand.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56044/1630022-wildcats_covert_action_teams__1992__1n_newsstand.jpeg 3924w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/56044/1630022-wildcats_covert_action_teams__1992__1n_newsstand.jpeg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56044/1630022-wildcats_covert_action_teams__1992__1n_newsstand.jpeg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56044/1630022-wildcats_covert_action_teams__1992__1n_newsstand.jpeg 412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></a><figcaption>Issue #1</figcaption></figure><p>Spartan was created by <a href=\"../../brandon-choi/26-42801/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brandon Choi</a> and <a href=\"../../jim-lee/26-2399/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jim Lee</a> for the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wildcats/4060-25113/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25113\">WildC.A.T.S</a> comic book series, published by <a href=\"/image/4010-513/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-513\">Image</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Wildstorm Universe</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1678997\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34310/1678997-spartan.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0773195876289\" data-width=\"582\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 582px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34310/1678997-spartan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1678997\"><img alt=\"Spartan (Wildstorm Universe)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" data-width=\"594\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34310/1678997-spartan.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34310/1678997-spartan.jpg 582w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spartan (Wildstorm Universe)\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34310/1678997-spartan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34310/1678997-spartan.jpg 582w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" data-width=\"594\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spartan (Wildstorm Universe)</figcaption></figure><p>In the early 60’s a Daemonite named <a href=\"/helspont/4005-40632/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40632\">Helspont</a> made a move against humanity. He tried to start a nuclear war between the most powerful nations on Earth in order to get humans to destroy themselves so the planet would be empty for the Daemonites. Lord <a href=\"/emp/4005-21970/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21970\">Emp</a>, a Kherubim, created <a href=\"/team-1/4060-40690/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40690\">Team 1</a> to combat Helspont and the villains he had gathered to help him. Team 1 was made up of many characters that would go on to their own roles in the Wildstorm Universe and John Colt was asked to be a part of this team. He accepted, becoming the field leader of the group. As soon as the team was formed, they were sent into battle against Helspont, who had already seized control of a US missile base so he could get access to a nuke.</p><p>As Helspont got ready to launch the missile, Team 1 arrived and a fight ensued. Team 1 was vastly outnumbered and things quickly got out of hand. John was taking on a legion of Daemonites on his own, but they were getting past him and were making their way to the member of his team that was responsible for stopping Helspont's bomb from launching.</p><p>John was in the middle of the aliens but couldn't take them all out so he ordered Majestic to use his laser vision to kill them all. Majestic didn't want to do it since it would kill John too, but there was no other choice so he blasted them all away. Even though John sacrificed himself, the team still failed and the missile was launched. Fortunately, one member of the team (<a href=\"/regiment/4005-42168/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42168\">Regiment</a>) jumped on the missile and destroyed it as it flew, possibly dying in the process.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Wildstorm Universe</h3><h4>WildC.A.T.s - Spartan/Hadrian</h4><p>Through John's body had died his mind lived on. Before he had been killed, <a href=\"/emp/4005-21970/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21970\">Emp</a> copied John's personality so he could attach it to a prototype Spartan android later. Emp perfected the android and in the 90's when he started the <a href=\"/wildcats/4060-25113/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25113\">WildC.A.T.s</a>, Spartan was born and was made the leader of the team (His codename was Spartan after the android guards on <a href=\"/khera/4020-40910/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40910\">Khera</a> but he also went by Hadrian).</p><p>He had no memory of Team 1 or his life before and though he had his/Yon Kohl/John Colt's personality, he was emotionless and acted very much like the robot he was. It wasn't until the team was together (and the addition of <a href=\"/voodoo/4005-12013/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12013\">Voodoo</a>) that Spartan started to come alive. He and Voodoo started a relationship and he started using the name Hadrian more when he wasn't on the battlefield.</p><p>After the team went on a mission to stop the Daeomites from reactivating their ship the Kherubim ship was found as well. However their ship was set to detonate and the team flew the ship into the atmosphere so it would harmlessly explode and the team was thought to have died and only Spartan survived but his body had sustained major damage. He was repaired by <a href=\"/stormwatch/4060-26261/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26261\">Stormwatch</a> and even became a member for a time until his death during a mission. Else where it was revealed the WildC.A.T.s had lived and use the ships hyperdrive to travel to Khera.</p><p>While there they found that the battle with the Deaomites was over thousands of years ago and Khera was the victor. Using a backup disk of Spartan Emp rebuilt him in a more powerful body using Kherubim science and acted as Emp's guard. He would come across a plot to kill Zealot and before he could reveal this he was almost destroyed. Luckily the team found him repaired him and stop the plot. After finding out much of the terrible things the Kherubim had done they left the planet.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-93476\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/93476-116739-kaizen-gamorra.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.7275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/93476-116739-kaizen-gamorra.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-93476\"><img alt=\"Kaizen Gamorra\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/308/93476-116739-kaizen-gamorra.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/93476-116739-kaizen-gamorra.jpg 400w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/308/93476-116739-kaizen-gamorra.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kaizen Gamorra\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/308/93476-116739-kaizen-gamorra.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/93476-116739-kaizen-gamorra.jpg 400w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/308/93476-116739-kaizen-gamorra.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kaizen Gamorra</figcaption></figure><p>After going home the team traveled to Gamorra island to battle the ruler <a href=\"/kaizen-gamorra/4005-24905/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24905\">Kaizen Gamorra</a>. It was discovered he was really John Colt whose body had been healed and sent to replace the captured Gamorra. After a battle with Spartan that ended with Kaizen being dethroned he was killed by Mr. Majestic again. John Colt was now awakened in Spartan who even began to use the name John Colt. Later after the team disbanded after Zealot's apparent death, Emp and Spartan went to battle the villain <a href=\"/kenyan/4005-40900/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40900\">Kenyan</a>. Emp hoped he could get Kenyan to kill him so he would be able to ascend and the release of energy would take Kenyan with him, but he instead took his own life, however Spartan killed Emp and thanks to some upgrades survived the explosion.</p><h4>Jack Marlowe</h4><p>Spartan realized that the superhero lifestyle wasn't the most efficient way to meet Emp's wishes for a better world, so Spartan took the identity of Jack Marlowe and decided to wield the Halo Corporation as his tool to improve the world. It is during this period that a superhuman serial killer called Samuel Smith surfaces and had been making his way across the United States. Samuel targets Voodoo, injuring her throat and slicing off both her legs with his eyebeams. Smith also temporarily blinded Maul when the latter tried to defend Priscilla. Furious, Jack set a trap for the killer, who was finally killed by Grifter, although his death didn't give Marlowe any kind of pleasure or satisfaction.</p><p>Marlowe began to use Kherubim technology in order to produce high-tech equipment, far beyond any created with human technology. During this time Void, Noir, and Grifter joined the Halo Corporation. Void became a great asset to the corporation because her ability to teleport allowed her access to Otherspace, a realm of limitless energy. Noir discovered that the matter in Otherspace could be used to create batteries that would last forever. Betraying the corporation, he attempted to kill Void and reprogrammed Ladytron, another former Wildcat.</p><p>Marlowe saved Void by merging with her; this greatly increased his own powers as well as allowing him her ability to teleport. He easily defeated the newly reprogrammed Ladytron and transported Noir to Otherspace, where he would meet his death without a protective suit. Marlowe then utilized Noir's plans and began producing batteries that would last for an eternity.</p><p>This was only but the first step in a plan to better the world and he soon bought other companies, including an accounting firm. Edwin Dolby, an intellectual employed at the accounting firm, was fascinated by Marlowe's plans for the future and in time became his right-hand man. Meanwhile, Grifter performed black ops missions under Marlowe, including the liberation child laborers.</p><p>The discovery that Halo Corporation batteries could fuel a car indefinitely resulted in the production of Halo Cars. These Halo Cars that didn't depend on gasoline shocked the entire world and many politicians and businessmen marked Marlowe as a threat. An assassin was sent to Halo, but was easily handled by Marlowe, who wasn't impressed in the least by these threats. After Grifter learned the whereabouts of Zealot, who had been captured and imprisoned by her former followers, he orchestrated a mission to liberate her.</p><p>Although Marlowe said he could not help his effort due to his fear of harming the integrity of the Halo Corporation, he did use his abilities in order to manipulate the battle from behind the scenes so Grifter could be successful. Jack Marlowe also sponsors the Seminary. The Seminary is a school for young superheroes.</p><h3>World's End</h3><p>Because of actions taken by Nemesis orchestrated (unbeknownst to her) by the Wildcats old friend Tao, the world all but ended. The moon was destroyed, the Earth's orbit shifted, most of the planet's technology was obliterated, many heroes were missing, more SPBs than ever had appeared, and the Wildcats were only slightly better off than the rest of the world. The team was hit hard and the only reason they had a foothold in the world was because of the Halo batteries from 3.0. When most of the technology went out the energy in the batteries that could run forever kept the Halo building functioning.</p><p>It was damaged, but it still worked so the Wildcats kept it as a base and shelter for whatever people they could find in the outside world. They couldn't get any more power though because the energy only worked around the Halo building and they couldn't just go get more since Jack Marlowe's Void powers were the only way to get to the dimension where it came from and Jack wasn't Jack anymore. He'd lost his Void powers when a new Void was born (Captain Atom: Armageddon) and his more advanced robotic abilities had been lost during World's End as a result of a particularly destructive EMP in his vicinity.</p><p>He changed his name back to Hadrian (or Spartan) and was in an even worse state than he was at the beginning of Wildcats. He was back in his old body but the drastic shift from being practically a god to a robot really messed with his head and he no longer considers himself the leader of the team.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Powers</h3><ul><li><strong>Bio-Android Body</strong>: As a bio-synthetic humanoid, Spartan has been upgraded several times. Spartan is made from highly advanced Kherubim technology and is possibly one of the most sophisticated machines in the universe. <ul><li><strong>Superhuman Strength</strong>: Spartan possesses massive superhuman strength capable of benching 60 tons of weight with seldom difficulty and nearly 70 tons with due effort. After a series of upgrades his strength level had increased by staggering amounts, initially through receiving a new kheran model body he proved capable of pumping 80 tons with minimal effort then 115 tons with exertion. Then after receiving further modification from Marlowe his strength was upped further into the upper 100 ton marker. Easily able to tear apart a Kherubim 'low-grav warcrawler' tank apart with his bare hands.</li><li><strong>Superhuman Durability</strong>: Spartan is not 'invulnerable' in the true sense of the word, but he is still fairly tough and difficult to injure. He is easily bulletproof and invulnerable to most conventional street weapons such as a common knife, gun, bullets etc. Armor-piercing bullets can pierce his biosynthetic flesh as well as powerful assaults from superhumans can easily damage him. Although recent upgrades to his chassis has made him tough enough to withstand stronger impacts. Ranging from surviving mortar fire from an alien tank, to standing ground against a speeding vehicle without budging and parrying superhuman blows from the likes of Fairchild with ease.</li><li><strong>Superhuman Stamina</strong>: In Spartan's case, however, it's the issue of endurance and the ability to function even with considerable damage done to him. He could have both arms ripped off with holes torn through most of his body and even his head, and still be capable of functioning and pushing onward. In many ways, the only way to truly defeat Spartan is to completely destroy him and shut his systems down.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Energy Projection</strong>: As akin to all Spartan series android's, Yohn Kohl can emit and control vast quantities of bio-plasma energy for offensive and defensive means. <ul><li><strong>Bio-Molecular Blast</strong>: Spartan is capable of generating powerful amounts of energy and releasing them from his body in the form of explosive blasts from his hands &amp; eyes known as bio-blasts. These powerful bursts of energy can hit with as much as 70 tons of force. Exerting as much internal power as he can spare, these blasts can reach 90 tons of force. Easily capable of shredding most alloys and leveling most things.</li><li><strong>Energy Enhanced Punches</strong>: Spartan can contain energy within his fists and then discharge it upon impact, multiplying the strength of his blows by about 2-4 time over.</li><li><strong>Plasma Shield</strong>: Spartan is capable of generating fields of plasma energy designed to protect himself and others and repel attacks against him. The field can protect him from up to 90 tons of force from both physical attacks and equivalent energy ones as well.</li><li><strong>Holo Projection</strong>: The ability to project holographic images.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Enhanced Senses</strong>: The body on Kheran gave him enhanced senses that allowed him to scan entire cities for specific humans. X-ray and thermal visions and other abilities that are added on and learned as time progresses. <ul><li><strong>Enhanced Vision</strong><ul><li><strong>X-Ray Vision</strong></li><li><strong>Thermal Vision</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Enhanced Sense of Smell</strong></li><li><strong>Enhanced Hearing</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Flight</strong>: Spartan is capable of flight via the generation of an anti-gravity field about his body. His speed range is somewhere at around Mach-1 (750 mph). Although flying at top speed for extended periods of time tend to drain his energy reserves.</li><li><strong>Psychic Immunity</strong>: As he is a cybernetic entity, Spartan's mind simply cannot be affected to an optimal degree by telepaths. It doesn't matter how powerful you are, his brain waves and mental functions simply do not allow it. Not even Despot, the most powerful psi to ever live, was capable of mentally controlling or reading the thoughts of Spartan.</li><li><strong>Immortality</strong>: Spartan possesses in essence, assured immortality. If his body is destroyed or in anyway damaged beyond repair, his mind is usually immediately downloaded into another body either at HALO or on the MIRV itself for maximum memory and personality containment.</li><li><strong>Accelerated Healing</strong>: Spartans are also capable of self-repair so they can mend themselves after battle as long as they are not too extensively damaged.</li><li><strong>Technopathy</strong>: Spartan could wirelessly connect with any computer system and bend it to his will. He could even link up to telephone lines and answer phone calls or radio transmissions via WiFi in his networking. After the world's end event, Spartan's interfacing ability was largely diminished now he could only make machine contact with telephone and radio transmissions and could only control the few remaining Spartan guards which survived Armageddon.</li></ul><h3>Abilities</h3><ul><li><strong>Genius Level Intellect</strong>: Each Spartan has a \"brain\" more powerful than any other computer (on Earth or otherwise), is programmed to be able to use any technology it comes across. His body is controlled by a highly advanced silicon-based neurotronic brain. High speed CPU processors functioning at literally the speed of light, extensive files and combat data. They can also download data on his combat foes to best determine their weaknesses and defeat them.</li><li><strong>Leadership</strong></li><li><strong>Hand-to-Hand Combat</strong> (Advanced)</li><li><strong>Weaponry</strong></li></ul><h3>Weaknesses</h3><ul><li><strong>Vulnerability to Electromagnetism</strong>: Spartan's body has a weakness to anything that can affect synthetics such as EMP pulses and/or any related superhuman ability.</li></ul><h3>Teleportation</h3><p>Spartan is capable of teleporting himself, others and objects from place to place with no effort. Distance is not an issue (he has easily gone from his office to space and back) and neither is precision. He can teleport specific things, large groups and even move different things all across the world at the same time. His teleportation also allows him to enter other dimensions at will. Aside from teleportation, Void's powers increased all of Spartan's physical attributes, making him now strong, fast and durable enough to face beings like Mr.</p><p>Majestic in all out combat and win. His use of energy has also been affected and increased. Not only are his energy blasts now more powerful, Spartan is able to create energy shields, holograms, and energy constructs formed from pink light, the signature color of Void's powers.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Deathmate</h3><p>Spartan appeared in Deathmate crossover.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4>WildC.A.T.s series</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/3492571-250px-wild_c.a.t.s_cover_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3492571\" data-ratio=\"1.424\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.4%\" href=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/3492571-250px-wild_c.a.t.s_cover_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3492571\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/3492571-250px-wild_c.a.t.s_cover_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/3492571-250px-wild_c.a.t.s_cover_.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/3492571-250px-wild_c.a.t.s_cover_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/3492571-250px-wild_c.a.t.s_cover_.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In the short-lived <a href=\"/wild-cats/4075-179/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-179\">WildC.A.T.S.</a> animated TV series, Spartan was portrayed as a Kherubim named Hadrian who was rebuilt as a cyborg prior to the show's beginning.

    "description": "<p>In 2000, Ruddock found out that <a href=\"/slaughterhouse-smith/4005-41900/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41900\">Slaughterhouse Smith</a>'s daughter had had a son, who had the powers similar to his grandfather. Dreaming of revenge against the relatives of <a href=\"/emp/4005-21970/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21970\">Saul Baxter</a> (who was officially dead), Ruddock told Samuel Smith the truth about his grandfather and his powers -- only to discover after he was done that Samuel was actually an utter, murderous psychopath. Feeling crushed that he had thus led the Smith family to what would obviously be an ignominious end - feelings worsened by a plot for treason he had conceived at one point and which he was trying to atone for ever since - the aged valet stopped Slaughterhouse Smith's life support equipment and took a suicide pill, dying near the inert form of his master.</p><p>Samuel Smith, after a number of psychotic murders in an attempt to find and kill <a href=\"/spartan/4005-12006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12006\">Mr. Marlowe</a>, the supposed descendant of Saul Baxter, was killed by <a href=\"/grifter/4005-23624/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23624\">Grifter</a>. However, his grandfather survived even the shutdown of his life-support equipment and emerged from his coma unaided a few years after those events.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>Samuel inherited abilities from his grandfather but were limited in comparison. He could project concentrated heat beams from his eyes for undetermined amounts of time, at their most focused they can slice and burn through flesh and steel with ease. When emitted at full power his optic blasts erupted into a wide arcing flash flare reducing everything in their path to cinders. Potent as they were being able to blind and cripple Maul of the WildC.A.T.s they proved ineffective against Spartan even using full strength.</p>",

    "description": "<p>He first met the Wildcats when he was hunting a SPB that was trying to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12006\" href=\"/spartan/4005-12006/\">Spartan</a>. Spartan had <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23624\" href=\"/grifter/4005-23624/\">Grifter</a> kill the SPB and then he offered Agent Wax a job. Wax kept an eye on the National Park Service and made sure they didn't investigate Spartan too much. He also worked with Spartan a lot, which kept him out of the office and prevented him from doing his job so he got demoted. As payback, he used his hypnotic powers to sleep with his boss's wife (not just once but on a regular basis). Eventually his boss found out and tried to kill him. Wax made him kill himself instead and then used his hypnosis to make everyone in the National Park Service think he was the boss. This allowed him to run the National Park Service and still work with Spartan (and also keep sleeping with boss's wife).</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>Maxine Manchester, Ladytron, was created by writer<a href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\"> Alan Moore</a>, and artist <a href=\"/travis-charest/4040-12188/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-12188\">Travis Charest</a>. She was created during the period when <a href=\"/image/4010-513/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-513\">Image Comics </a>published the<a href=\"/wildstorm/4010-708/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-708\"> Wildstorm</a> imprint.</p><p> </p><h2>Origin</h2><p>When she was young, Maxine ran away from home to avoid sexual abuse from her father. However, in  <a href=\"/wildcats-covert-action-teams-22-cats-cradle/4000-47286/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-47286\">WildC.A.T.s: Covert Action Teams #22 - Cat's Cradle</a>, it is mentioned that she was eventually placed in the foster care system, and was later ejected from a psychiatric facility for being \"too disruptive.\" Striking out on her own,  Maxine turned to a life of crime to support herself. She would rob and kill to get what she needed. After a crime spree that included armed robbery and left five people dead and wounded seventeen others, Maxine was shot multiple times during a gunfight with police in Newark. Her life was saved however when a Dr. Khaz used robotic parts to replace her damaged body. She used her new form to escape the prison infirmary she was recovering, making her way towards Chicago.  At one point, she was recaptured by Khaz, who  informed her of a robot built before her he christened Stanley. Khaz saw himself  as a father  to Stan, and he needed her help to find his \"son.\" However, after finding him, Maixne soon fell in love with Stan's own homicidal tendencies. They embarked upon a crime spree together, and even wed during this time. The couple found that they wanted the Doctor dead, but he had been prepared for such a contingency and had an override in place. He took control of Stan and made him attack his wife. She killed both Stanley and his creator before returning to her lone life of crime.</p><h2>Wild.C.A.T.s</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15723/338972-134441-wildc-a-t-s.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338972\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.9175\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15723/338972-134441-wildc-a-t-s.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338972\"><img alt=\"Wild.C.A.T.sTa\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15723/338972-134441-wildc-a-t-s.JPG\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15723/338972-134441-wildc-a-t-s.JPG 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Wild.C.A.T.sTa</figcaption></figure><p>During a mission the super hero team, the <a href=\"/wildcats/4060-25113/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25113\">Wild.C.A.T.s</a> had gone missing and were thought to have died. In their place <a href=\"/mr-majestic/4005-21972/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21972\">Mr. Majestic</a> and <a href=\"/savant/4005-21971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21971\">Savant</a> chose to put together a new fighting team and they chose Maxine, along with <a href=\"/tao/4005-4590/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4590\">Tao</a> and <a href=\"/condition-red/4005-21985/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21985\">Condition Red</a>. However Mr. Majestic was against allowing her to be in the group, but Savant wanted the group to have another female member aside from herself, and Tao also wanted her on the team and used his skills of persuasion to get Majestic to back down. The other members picked her up as she was attempting to steal money from a heroin deal at a Thai restaurant in Chicago.  Tao subdued her by causing her to ingest a large amount of heroin. Once captured, Maxine was placed in a virtual reality prison designed by Tao, which had the secondary effect of focusing her violent tendencies towards the team's goals.  She also gradually found herself falling for her comrade, Condition Red, but he did not reciprocate her feelings. He was adamant about avoiding her advances and even used his wounds during an explosion to get away from her. Maxine became very upset and took this out on the person who caused his injuries. Along with <a href=\"/spartan/4005-12006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12006\">Spartan,</a> Condition Red's assailant told her that it was their teammate, Tao, who gave the orders to attack them. Along with the rest of the team she confronted him about the incident and he was found to be a criminal genius who had been using the team to start a <a href=\"/gang-war/4045-40664/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40664\">Gang War</a>. Despite his lack of true powers, he was able to use his wits to do a great deal of damage to the group. Tao was able to disconnect the cooling unit for her nuclear core. It would have gone critical if Majestic had not removed it and flown it into space to freely detonate. The battle ended when Majestic returned killing him, though Maxine has suffered a great deal of damage. In order to repair her she was brought to the Church of Gort. The Church is made up of robots and cyborgs who felt all life was indeed sacred. She soon became a member and followed in their teachings. Majestic had became enthusiastic about her new found faith. However, she only viewed machine life as sacred, but Majestic still felt this was better than her previous style. Ttrouble arose in the Church and some of it's patrons felt she was too organic and attacked her.</p><h2>Halo Corporation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/82715-164947-ladytron.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-82715\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.8675\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/82715-164947-ladytron.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-82715\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/82715-164947-ladytron.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/82715-164947-ladytron.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a></figure><p>After abandoning the Church, Maxine met Condition Red's brother, <a href=\"/grifter/4005-23624/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23624\">Grifter</a>, but her personality led him to send her to the offices of the Halo Corporation to get rid of her.

Maxine decided to get back at him for his attack. To this end, she attacked guests at a hotel who shared Smith's surname. This effort proved fruitless, but eventually, she encountered the right Smith, who was more powerful than Maxine was prepared for. She was damaged very badly. Maxine appeared again after her body was reprogrammed by <a href=\"/noir/4005-12012/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12012\">Noir</a>. He altered her form and controlled her as a weapon against the corporation, but her form was beaten by Hadrian.

Mr. Majestic repeatedly attacks the building for supplies to send back to his new home in Hawaii. He asks some of the team to come but doesn't ask Ladytron due to her anti-social behavior. She takes part in the teams missions to find the oasis that was thought to have been made by the <a href=\"/engineer/4005-17607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17607\">Engineer</a> but actually created by <a href=\"/tumbleweed/4005-53324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53324\">Tumbleweed</a>. Later, the team's old enemies, the Daemonites come to L.A., now able to survive there unaided. After a battle between the WildC.A.T.s and the Daemonites,  the two groups formed an uneasy treaty.</p><p>Ladytron then rallied a group of robots and cyborgs belonging to the Church of Gort to fight against the Daemonites, which disolved the treaty. She made the humans understand that the robots and humans need to work together if they expect to live through this crisis. Nemesis and Backlash later leave the team expecting Majestic's offer to relocate in Hawaii but they later send a distress call to the team asking them for help. Voodoo, having assumed the mantle as the team's leader, tells Ladytron to stay behind because of her relationship with Majestic, but after the team leaves, the Daemonites get ready to attack their now vulnerable base.</p><p> </p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">New 52</h2><p>Maxine Manchester has reappeared in New 52 continuity.</p><h2>Powers And Abilities</h2><p>Ladytron is a cyborg and like any other, her physical form is stronger and more durable than humans. She can survive bullets being fired at her and lift objects as heavy as an automobile. Her body was made to be used as a weapon and she has many different guns and weapons built right into her. Her mouth is even armed with a sonic cannon. As a cyborg, Maxine can survive being destroyed as long as some one can repair her and can also have her mechanical parts upgraded. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Voodoo’s original origin differs from that in the new 52. Her real name is Priscilla Kitaen. She originally worked as a stripper before she was discovered by the <a href=\"../../wildcats/65-25113/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WildC.A.T.s</a> and the <a href=\"../../daemonites/65-41061/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daemonites</a>. Both groups were after her because she had a unique ability called the “Sight” which allows her to detect when someone is being controlled by a Daemonite and remove it from the body.</p><p>In <a href=\"/the-new-52/4015-56061/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56061\">the new 52</a> there are in fact two Voodoos, one who is a Daemonite clone of the other and being used as an agent against the superheroes of Earth. As of yet very little has been revealed about the two characters, other than the original was being held in a government facility against her will. After Voodoo is freed and told what her clone has been doing she reacts poorly to the information, specifically that the clone was a strip club dancer. This suggests a break from the past of the character wherein that was a core part of her origin. Also she is shown outside of a relatively normal house in the USA somewhere, and thus it is suggested that she had a fairly common upbringing.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2614696-vd01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2614696\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.70875763747454\" data-width=\"491\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 491px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2614696-vd01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2614696\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2614696-vd01.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2614696-vd01.jpg 491w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/92932/2614696-vd01.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2614696-vd01.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>The final issue of the monthly series revealed her origin (as part of DC's Zero Month of the new 52 dealing specifically with team origins.) Priscilla was a regular woman who went out one night and was abducted by Daemonites. They had abducted many humans with the interest of experimenting on them. In Priscilla's case something went wrong as she was able to escape her containment tank where she was monitored while the experiments took place. The action was shown to be occurring on a Daemonite spaceship which was cloaked within the Earth's atmosphere. After escaping she exhibited her power for the first time. She also witnessed the other humans that were being experimented on as well as other humans in containment cells.</p><p>They begged for her return but she instead ran, vowing to return for them. She broke through the hull not yet realizing that it was an aircraft. She had previously transformed into herself but with wings and scales and she used this to slow her descent. In the meantime breaching the hull had made the Daemonite ship show up on radar and they were soon attacked by the Black Razors (including <a href=\"/jessica-fallon/4005-79802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79802\">Jessica Fallon</a>.) Priscilla was rescued but taken into custody. Meanwhile the aliens aboard the ship decided to clone her from leftover genetic material.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Voodoo first appeared in <a href=\"/wildcats-covert-action-teams/4050-6625/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-6625\">WildC.A.T.S.</a> #1 in August 1992 and was created by <a href=\"/brandon-choi/4040-42801/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42801\">Brandon Choi</a> and <a href=\"/jim-lee/4040-2399/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2399\">Jim Lee</a>. Her first appearance under the DC label was in <a href=\"/voodoo/4050-43021/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-43021\">Voodoo</a> #5 in 2012.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Wildstorm Universe</h3><p>After she joined the WildC.A.T.s her many psychic and animalistic powers were revealed. She would began a long running relationship with team leader <a href=\"../../spartan/29-12006/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spartan</a> for some time. After she was shot and sent into a coma, the team member <a href=\"../../void/29-12010/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Void</a> used a computer to enter her mind. There it was revealed that she was a descendant from a <a href=\"../../khera/34-40910/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kherubim</a> who had been controlled by a Daemonite making her a Kherubim/Daemonite/human hybrid.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint / Earth 0</h3><p>The character in the DC relaunch was first shown to be somewhat ambiguous. Although a hero in the past, her heroic actions were not always completely moral. The new Voodoo was quite the opposite of a hero though, killing her way across the southern United States. This character's motivation was to serve her Daemonite overlords, which she did to the best of her ability. After confronting a secret government facility she realized that she was in fact a clone and that the real Voodoo lay trapped in a form of stasis. The real Voodoo was freed and sought to find and stop the clone.</p><p>After the realization that the past actions of the clone have affected how she is perceived, she seeks to \"get her life back.\" In addition to this she holds some grudge against the Black Razors because she was imprisoned by them. By the end of her series she achieves this closure.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Wildstorm Universe</h3><h4>WildC.A.T.S.</h4><p>As Voodoo's origin story formed the basis for her first real story arc, the subsequent story arcs were quite often focused on explaining more about her background. During a mission with the team a crashed Kherubium spaceship is discovered and to keep it from destroying the <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a>, they use it to travel to the planet <a href=\"../../khera/34-40910/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khera</a>. Upon arriving there she is made to go to a Daemonite ghetto and finds that the war between Daemonites and Kherubims is over and the Daemonites have lost. She finds that most Daemonites were not villains and the Earth based Daemonites were composed of a group of fanatic zealots. After finding the rest of the team, she is insulted by <a href=\"../../zealot/29-11586/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zealot</a> and loses faith in the whole Kherubim race, but is still able to stop a plan to kill Zealot. Due to everything she sees on <a href=\"../../khera/34-40910/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khera</a> she leaves the team when they return to Earth.</p><p>Voodoo becomes an exotic dancer again living in <a href=\"../../new-orleans/34-55684/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Orleans</a>. After meeting two men named <a href=\"/papa-legba/4005-81851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81851\">Attibon</a> and <a href=\"/mait-carrefour/4005-81852/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81852\">Carry-4</a> she begins to work for <a href=\"/christian-charles/4005-81853/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81853\">Christian Charles</a> at the Midnight Lounge. She becomes friends with fellow dancer <a href=\"/purity/4005-81855/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81855\">Purity</a>. She later meets a prostitute named Freda and an ex-hitman named Saturday. However, it is revealed that Attibon, Freda, and Saturday are actually <a href=\"/erzulie-freda/4005-81858/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81858\">Erzulie</a>, Papa Legba and <a href=\"/baron-samedi/4005-81859/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81859\">Baron Samedi</a>, three deities related to Voodoo. It is also revealed that Charles was killing his dancers so he can take their blood and bathe in it. This was part of an attempt to perform a ritual that would bring back to life his evil magician father Jean-Pierre LaCroix. Carry-4 is revealed to be an evil Voodoo deity named <a href=\"/mait-carrefour/4005-81852/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81852\">Mait Carrefour</a>.</p><p>Charles intends to kill Purity, but Voodoo and David Dove (the <a href=\"/detective/4015-55842/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55842\">detective</a> investigating the murders) are able to save her life. However, Charles had gained enough blood to be able to perform the ritual. Voodoo allows Erzulie Freda to take control of her body, and then Erzulie Freda is able to lure LaCroix back into the afterlife. After the events of this series, Voodoo decides that her encounter is proof that she should become a master in understanding the practices of voodoo, and at that time she is taken in by a teacher of sorcery named Gran'Mere.</p><p>Some months later after the incident, Priscilla goes back to the WildC.A.T.s. However, her time with the team is short-lived as the team breaks up after Zealot is assumed to have died. She and <a href=\"../../maul/29-21968/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jeremy Stone</a> begin to live together and they soon realize that they are in love. Soon after, due to her connection with the <a href=\"../../halo-corporation/65-41734/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halo Corporation</a> she is attacked by <a href=\"../../samuel-smith/29-12007/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Samuel Smith</a>, the grandson of <a href=\"../../slaughterhouse-smith/29-41900/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Slaughterhouse Smith</a> who wanted revenge for <a href=\"../../spartan/29-12006/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spartan</a> (<a href=\"../../spartan/29-12006/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Marlowe</a>) killing his father. He attacks Voodoo, cutting off her legs and seriously hurting her neck. He is subsequently beaten by <a href=\"../../grifter/29-23624/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grifter</a> and Jack. Grifter is able to get Jeremy to stop trying to remove Voodoo’s Daemonite abilities. The hospital staff are amazed at the rate at which she heals from her injuries. Soon she meets a Daemonite who was against the others. He is able to teach her about her powers to control time and even her regenerating powers, causing her legs to be fully restored.</p><p>The old Daemonite also gets Voodoo to engage in a relationship with Stone. The relationship between the two does not last long as Voodoo discover that she can enhance her telepathic abilities by having sex with others and Stone is unable to deal with the fact that she is intimate with more men than just himself. Voodoo decides to break up with Stone and the two begin to fight. However, due to a side effect of his powers, Stone loses his intelligence with his size and Voodoo enrages him so he would forget the purpose of the battle and she uses this to leave him.</p><p>Along with the rest of the Wildstorm Universe, Priscilla becomes involved in the battle with <a href=\"../../captain-atom/29-2050/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Atom</a> and during the battle she displays new magnetic powers and uses them to control his body. However after she attempts to use her telepathy on him, he is able to connect her to the minds of every source of knowledge, causing her to pass out from the overload. Priscilla later becomes a stripper again. She performs for very rich clients such as shieks, until Spartan contacts her and after a night of passion she goes to work for him, with him tripling her common salary.</p><h4>World's End</h4><p>After the U.S. government captures and clones the superhero High, clones called <a href=\"../../reapers/65-55911/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reapers</a> are let loose on the world. Their programing causes them to attack anyone and anything, including superheroes. They cause so much damage to the planet itself that Earth is sent off its axis, smog covers the sun and more and more super powered beings appear. However the WildC.A.Ts are not as badly affected as the rest of the world, due to the batteries that the Halo Company had build that would not die. This meant they had technology and power. Voodoo once again joins the team, led by Spartan now without his <a href=\"../../void/29-12010/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Void</a> powers. She along with the rest of the team is attacked by <a href=\"../../mr-majestic/29-21972/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Majestic</a>. Majestic had been raiding Halo for anything he needed and bringing it back to his new land in <a href=\"../../hawaii/34-56180/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hawaii</a>. He offers some of the team a chance to come with him but does not ask Voodoo, due to her Daemonite side, however all members refuse.</p><p>The team go on a mission to <a href=\"../../nevada/34-55779/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nevada</a> in search of an oasis of life that appears after the world ended which may or may not be the garden made by the <a href=\"../../engineer/29-17607/\" rel=\"nofollow\">first Engineer</a>. They find the location defended by <a href=\"../../paris/29-45032/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paris</a> and <a href=\"../../gramalkin/29-51930/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gramalkin</a> and Voodoo and Grifter fight them so that they can share the garden. <a href=\"../../maul/29-21968/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maul</a> goes crazy during the battle and begins to destroy the forest, but is stopped by Voodoo. However after the fight they realize the area was made by the <a href=\"../../the-paladins/65-53311/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paladin</a> <a href=\"../../tumbleweed/29-53324/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tumbleweed</a>. They want to use his powers to create more gardens but finds he can only maintain one at a time and remains there to keep it alive. She later has to counsel Spartan after he becomes more and more depressed at the loss of his Void powers and the chance to fix things. Their talk ends with a kiss that Maul sees.</p><p>Soon things only become worse as the team's old foes the Daemonites make their way to <a href=\"../../los-angeles/34-56019/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Los Angeles</a> lead by <a href=\"../../defile/29-25775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lord Defile</a>. However, after noticing that the Daemonites can survive unprotected in L.A., Voodoo makes a type of truce between the two sides and gets Defile to agree by resurrecting a small undead army of his victims.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint / Earth 0</h3><p>Following the events of <a href=\"/flashpoint/4045-56280/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56280\">Flashpoint</a>, the DC Universe was relaunched and incorporated in characters previously in the Wildstorm and Vertigo universes. In the case of Voodoo this meant for the first time in her publication history an ongoing monthly title and the first time that she appeared in mainstream DC Continuity. However, as was later revealed the early appearances of this new Voodoo was in fact a clone of hers. She was revealed as a strip club dancer that was doing so to gain military secrets from the loose lips of soldiers from a nearby and then went on a murderous rampage across the southern United States as she sought out her alien masters. After confronting <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\">Kyle Rayner</a> she continued on her original mission and after infiltrating a government complex she discovered that she was actually the clone of the real Voodoo.</p><p>After issue 8 it was decided that the series would be discontinued after issue 12 and the remainder of the series evolved into a conflict between the two, which started with the clone engaging Voodoo in the southwestern desert (while killing <a href=\"/black-jack/4005-80637/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80637\">Black Jack</a> and <a href=\"/jessica-fallon/4005-79802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79802\">Jessica Fallon</a>). Voodoo subsequently joined the Black Razors, hoping to track down her clone, and eventually ending up on <a href=\"/europa/4020-57861/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57861\">Europa</a> (the moon of Jupiter.)</p><p>After a brief confrontation with her a stalemate is reached and Voodoo flees with the Blue Flame, while the clone remains behind on the planet to be idolized by the random Daemonites. During the battle though Voodoo was able to sever their telepathic link. Once back on Earth Voodoo chooses to join the Black Razors and discovers that Grifter is in need of help.</p><p>For a short time she joined Grifter <a href=\"/grifter/4050-42791/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42791\">in his own self titled series</a>, but this series was canceled as well in another wave of cancelations and launches.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As with the remainder of the character's appearances, there is a difference between the pre-mainstream DC Universe character and the post-mainstream DC universe character. Additionally this is also complicated by the fact that in the post-mainstream DC Universe version of the character that there are fact two versions of the character, Voodoo herself and the clone. The clone generally has exhibited more advanced powers than Voodoo though it can be assumed that seeing as they are essentially the same being that Voodoo herself possesses the same powers, only that she has not developed them yet, or that she is not aware that she can use them in this way.</p><h3>The Sight</h3><p>Voodoo is part human, Kherubim and Daemonite which results in her having unique abilities not seen in either two. She has the power of the “Sight” which allows her to see any being or object as it truly is, meaning she is not affected by shape-shifters or any type of illusion.</p><h3>Telepath</h3><p>She is a telepath, meaning she has the power to read or take over a person's mind. She can focus her mental powers into a mental attack. She is also an empath allowing her to feel the emotions of those she chooses. As with all Daemonite machinery, they are receptive to Daeminite on a telepathic level and thus she can use her telepathic abilities to pilot Daemonite vehicles as well.</p><h3>Separating</h3><p>Another powerful gift is that she can separate any being that is possessing a body and she often uses this gift against Daemonites. It does usually result in pain and at times it may also hurt Voodoo herself. This power can be used from a distance, but she usually gets close to the person she is using it on.</p><h3>Shape-Shifing</h3><p>Due to training from a Daemonite, Voodoo can use more of the traditional powers attributed to a Daemonite. She can transform, revealing Daemonite parts resulting in her having claws, super strength, speed. She has the power to regrow lost limbs and heal from wounds faster than a normal human. She also has the power to control time itself and has recently used magnetic powers that were strong enough to control Captain Atom’s suit and even the tiny iron particles in his blood. She has been trained in traditional Voodoo magic and has even used the power of a Voodoo deity. Recently she has shown the power to animate the dead.</p><h3>Unarmed Combat</h3><p>She has also received <a href=\"/coda/4060-40958/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40958\">Coda</a> training from Zealot, Majestrix of the Coda, making her a deadly <a href=\"/martial-artists/4015-55802/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55802\">martial arts</a> expert. she has also been shown to exhibit exceptional healing abilities, including regenerating limbs.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint:</h3><h3>Daemonites</h3><p>Following the reboot into the DC Universe, her powers have become one of the most defined aspects of her character as her background remains clouded in mystery. Her placement as a deep cover information gatherer for the Daemonites means that she has both a range of abilities and a substantial amount of training to accomplish her goal. Her natural abilities include shapeshifting, telepathy, the produtions of projectile quills and the secretion of poison. The shapeshifting requires that she have contact with an individual first before being able to copy their appearance (though this ability has been shown to operate on animals as well). She is only capable of transforming a certain times within a short period as it takes a physical toll on her body. Her telepathy is somewhat limited, though it does give her the ability to analyze an enemy for their weaknesses.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2493166-voodoo01b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2493166\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.63466042154567\" data-width=\"427\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 427px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2493166-voodoo01b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2493166\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2493166-voodoo01b.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2493166-voodoo01b.jpg 427w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2493166-voodoo01b.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Voodoo's shapeshifting can be utilized in different ways, for instance she has the ability to create wings for flight (though the clone never exhibited this ability) or to copy animals. Also her shapeshifting has been used to provide a limited form of camouflage, as she can take on the colours of other objects which she might be standing in front of (though this is a fairly crude version of this ability.)</p><h3>Telepathy</h3><p>Along with her limited abilities in telepathy is a weakness in that she is unable to control her own mind when she uses these abilities, thus leaving herself vulnerable to counter telepathy.</p><h3>Claws &amp; Quills</h3><p>She is able to shoot the quills from her body over a short range, but the poison secretion has not been shown to be effective except through the lips. In her natural Daemonite form she also has razor sharp claws. Her training is not explained, but seemingly involves knowledge of espionage and related fields. She is able to infiltrate undetected into a high security facility and she is also adept at using seduction to her advantage, including as a distraction in combat.</p><h3>Unarmed Combat</h3><p>She is also a skilled hand- to-hand combatant, especially so as she transforms between human and Daemonite forms. Although the member of an alien race it appears that her knowledge of high tech items is rather limited. She has also been shown to be able to create weapons out of her body such as changing her arm into a spear. She has also used this ability to to act as a hook if she is trying remain stationary. As well during battles she has been shown to develop scales which she uses to bolster her defenses.</p><p>The cloned version of Priscilla has exhibited an application of the knowledge that she learned while exotic dancing. She uses this both in combat and as a means of manipulating men.</p><h3>Survival in Harsh Environments</h3><p>On a mission to <a href=\"/europa/4020-57861/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57861\">Europa</a>, both Priscilla and her clone exhibited the ability to function in the environment of Europa (the moon of Jupiter) while other humans required protection.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Deathmate</h3><p>Voodoo appeared as old woman.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4>WildC.A.T.s series</h4><p>Voodoo appeared in the cartoon show.</p>",

Warblade is assigned the task of leading Harvest's Ravagers and retrieving runaways. While appearing quite monstrous, his Ravager form is only cosmetic and appears to be manifested from Warblade's powers. His faceplate is defined with a wicked grin, and green glowing eyes. It appears as though his eyes glow a brilliant jade green even when his faceplate slides back. Unlike his Pre 52/Wildstorm counterpart, his hair is now an unusual platinum silver instead of green.

Where Wildstorm Warblade possessed compassion, honor, and conviction, these qualities have been replaced with a quick wit, sardonic humor, and masochism. He is very confident in his ability and usually approaches situations that would otherwise be dramatic, nonchalantly. Warblade is very apathetic and dissociated with society as a whole. He shows no fear in the face others, and no respect in the face of authority. He has no reservations engaging in the taking of lives. He loves to fight, he loves getting beat on, and he is absolutely unforgiving.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h4><strong>High Tensile Bio-Molecular Physiology</strong></h4><p>Warblade's unique physiology affords Reno many abilities, including limited shape shifting, limited physical resistance, the weaponizing and stretching of his limbs, and the ability to survive without oxygen or his vital organs.

As such, New-52 Warblade is not susceptible to common metal weaknesses such as heat, magnetics, and electricity. Another example of this was in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-ravagers-11-home-wreckers/4000-396389/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-396389\">The Ravagers #11 - Home Wreckers</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/thunder/4005-82371/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82371\">Thunder</a> &amp; <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lightning/4005-82372/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82372\">Lightning</a> combine their respective powers(Sound &amp; Electricity) to attack Warblade and he quickly recovers with no physical damage or pain. New 52 Warblade also appears to have more molecular cohesion, considering his body doesn't appear to liquefy like his pre-52 counterpart after extensive damage.</p><h4><strong>Infinitely Sharp Blades</strong></h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3035682\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.76714513556619\" data-width=\"627\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 627px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3035682\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg 627w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg 627w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3035682-infinite.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Reno's bladed constructs are under his complete mental control. This allows Warblade the ability to not only increase the density of his blades but also their lethality, making them as sharp as he desires at will. Thus far, Warblade has not met a surface he couldn't split in half. For all intents and purposes, his blades can cut through anything and they have yet to ever be shattered.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Shape Change</strong></h4><p>Warblade can psionically manipulate his cells to change form at will. This includes limited plasticity and the weaponizing of chosen body parts, stretching any number of his limbs several feet, usually focusing his efforts on more discrete body parts such as his fingers, hands, and arms. In the New 52, Warblade has constructed massive claws, swords, and massive claymore like cleavers. His Pre 52 self has been known to create more elaborate forms labeled as a Murder Tree, Skin of Thorns, Blood-Bird Posture, Fountain of Daggers, Flail of Arrows, Ruin's Butterfly, Bloody Briar, and in one case a giant dagger in the hands of a gargantuan <a href=\"/maul/4005-21968/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21968\">Maul</a>.</p><p> </p><h4><b>Healing / Reconstruction</b></h4><p>Warblade's body has the natural ability to reconstruct within moments of actual physical damage. It should be noted, his body is limitedly resistant to all forms of damage. Meaning while damage is possible, it's quite difficult. Most of the time Warblade has sustained damage, it has been from a bladed weapon of some kind. He has recovered from super powered beatings, collisions throughs mountains, impales through the heart, and in the case of his Pre 52 self, complete molecular deconstruction, effectively willing himself back to life, molecule by molecule.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Radar Invisibility</strong></h4><p>After visiting Khera, Pre-52 Reno Bryce learned how to make himself invisible to any kind of conventional radar. New-52 Warblade has yet to show this ability.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Telekinetic Immunity</strong></h4><p>In the pages of <a href=\"/superboy-9-the-culling-part-two-lost-claws/4000-335022/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-335022\">Superboy #9 - The Culling, Part Two: Lost Claws</a>, Warblade admits to being immune to Superboy's TK just like the rest of the mysterious Thirteen.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>HUD</strong></h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3460747\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.53591160220994\" data-width=\"1267\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1267px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3460747\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg 1267w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg 1267w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3460747-the-ravagers-009-%282013%29-%28nahga-empire%29-12.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In the pages of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-ravagers-9-fathers/4000-386100/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-386100\">The Ravagers #9 - Fathers</a>, it appears Warblade has access to a HUD or Heads-Up Display of some kind when analyzing the residue from a violent NBR infected inmate's energy attack.

Warblade has also been shown to lunge several feet without aid of any kind.</p><p> </p><h4><b>Enhanced Strength</b></h4><p>Warblade has commonly displayed enhanced strength, effortlessly whisking away full grown bodies single handedly, or shattering rock with enough force to explode like directed shrapnel.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Enhanced Stamina</strong></h3><p>Warblade is well known for his inability to ever give up.

Sadly, Fiona was killed. Warblade should have died, but he managed to pull himself back together, molecule by molecule. The process apparently took several months, but once he was whole again, he waisted no time in hunting Pike down. He found the mercenary in Sarajevo, where Reno then proceeded to kill his thugs in order to get Pike's undivided attention, it worked. Once they clashed, Reno mysteriously injected Pike with a number of his molecules and killed the mercenary by pulling them all back at once. He added the final insult, letting Pike know while he lay dying that regardless if he would of succeeded in killing Warblade or not, his vision wouldn't have come to pass because the WildC.A.T.s were already disbanded.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3041003\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.65384615384615\" data-width=\"598\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 598px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3041003\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg 598w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg 598w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3041003-artistic.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A broken Reno later joined a newly formed WildCats, but this iteration of the group was short lived.

Reno again put away the claws to focus on his art. He had fallen into such a depression, his painting reflected nothing but pain and suffering. He tried to not get involved in the countless day to day crimes, but one day he just couldn't take it anymore and he brought Warblade out to play. The local authorities were none too happy, particularly an Inspector by the name of Svoboda. The inspector tricked Reno into visiting his office the next morning. The next thing Reno knew, he was waking up in a hospital bed, where Svoboda explained they had a doctor splice with his genes on the molecular level to basically neuter his abilities. However, this wasn't enough, an example had to be made out of Reno Bryce.

He developed a drinking problem, and quickly got out of shape. He attempted to use his prosthetics to paint in order to support his drinking habit, but he was unsuccessful. He put aside his morality in order to find himself a paying job. He became a bouncer in a Bosnian whorehouse for a pimp named Khatchik. Reno developed an infatuation for one of the liquor girls there, a blonde buxom woman by the name of Lindy. What Reno didn't know was, a group called the Five Guys, traffickers were looking for Lindy. They didn't traffic drugs or weapons, they trafficked organic hybrid chemicals. Weapons of micro-destruction. Gene-spliced mutated viruses. Things escalated when Reno tried to help, tried to be the hero once more. He found himself in a hospital bed again, this time face to face with the doctor that took his powers and his hands, Slotnik. Doctor Slotnik was regretful of his actions, and offered to help restore his abilities with an experimental procedure. The procedure nearly killed him, but Reno once again willed himself to life, reconciling with himself he had become Warblade again. He killed the Five Guys, and discovered Linda's deceit, but spared her life under the condition that she never fail her niece whom had no one left, or Warblade would come back for her.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3042092\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.478515625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:47.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3042092\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg 1024w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg 1024w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83001/3042092-arts.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Reno Bryce later opened an exposition to showcase his artistic sculptures in Chicago, Illinois.

Hoping to use him as a host body for the Daemonite leader Helspont. Rescued by the WildC.A.T.s, Void activated Reno's powers and showed him that he was really a Crossbreed. He still resisted joining the WildC.A.T.s until Helspont put them at risk and he found himself compelled to fight on their behalf. Since joining the team he has had few regrets, although once in a while he wishes he still had time for more human pursuits.</p>",

Backlash was made team leader because of his strong psionic powers, his athletic physique and his ability to keep a cool head under pressure. He led Stormwatch Prime on many successful missions until an accident in at the end of Desert Storm. In their first confrontation with <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/deathtrap/4005-21979/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21979\">Deathtrap</a> and the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mercs/4060-51986/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51986\">Mercs</a>, Flashpoint, Nautika and Sunburst fell before the enemy and were presumed dead. Only Backlash and Battalion escaped, but the loss dealt a heavy blow to King. Between that loss and the evil path his father took, self-doubt started to form in his mind.</p><h3>Stormwatch</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774651-jk2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2774651\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1028037383178\" data-width=\"214\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 214px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774651-jk2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2774651\"><img alt=\"Stormwatch Prime\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774651-jk2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774651-jk2.jpg 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" data-width=\"214\"></a><figcaption>Stormwatch Prime</figcaption></figure><p>From the ashes of Stormwatch Prime, Stormwatch One was assembled. Tragedy struck again though, and on one of their first missions, King’s friend and mentor, John Windsor, was killed by Deathtrap. King thought about leaving Stormwatch after this but was convinced to stay by teammate <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/synergy/4005-23395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23395\">Synergy</a>. Not only did she make him realize that as a man of action, he needed Stormwatch as much as it needed him, but she activated his younger brother <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/strafe/4005-25825/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25825\">Malcolm</a>. She did it to save his life, but it gave Battalion another reason to stay. Now he could keep an eye on his brother since he’d now have to be trained on <a href=\"/skywatch/4020-55714/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55714\">Skywatch</a>.</p><p>Around this time Battalion and Synergy’s mutual interest in each was growing (though they denied it when asked). However, during an incident in another dimension to stop the sorcerer known as Argus, Battalion put a strain on that relationship. Though he’d followed Argus to his home dimension for the sole purpose of saving Christine, he met a princess there and they spent the night together. He almost stayed with her on her world but Argus killed her and so went back to his dimension, but the damage was done and he and Christine weren’t very close for a while.</p><p>After an incident on Skywatch where <a href=\"/daemonites/4060-41061/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41061\">Daemonites</a> released the <a href=\"/warguard/4060-51770/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51770\">WarGuard</a>, Battalion led Stormwatch One into a mission in <a href=\"/gamorra/4020-56350/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56350\">Gamorra</a> where they faced up against Deathtrap yet again. This time the confrontation with the deadly mercenary ended in victory even though the entire situation was a trap. Battalion found out that his teammates from Stormwatch Prime had survived and they were able to be rescued; though he had to disobey orders to do it. His teammates had been held captive for quite some time and while Nautika and Sunburst would eventually come to thank Battalion for finally saving them, Flashpoint, who had already resented Battalion never did, and his hatred for burned hotter.</p><p>Some time and several missions later, Battalion was met in his quarters by a time traveler named <a href=\"/timespan/4005-26090/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26090\">Timespan</a> who took him a year into the future. There he saw everything he knew in ruins. Skywatch had been destroyed, his team still existed but it was little more than a small resistance led by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spartan/4005-12006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12006\">Spartan</a> (now that the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wildcats/4060-25113/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25113\">WildC.A.T.S.</a> were dead), and his father <a href=\"/despot/4005-25874/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25874\">Despot</a> was on the cusp of taking over the world. On top of that, it appeared that he himself had died. After returning from the future he told no-one what he had seen and continued going on missions. Not knowing exactly when he would die, he was more determined than ever to make a difference before he did, repeatedly disobeying orders and putting himself in dangerous positions that he didn’t have to, but surviving and gaining victory. During this time he finally allowed himself to act on his feelings for Synergy and they got very close, acting like a couple both on and off duty, though that was somewhat affected by her becoming Weatherman after <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/henry-bendix/4005-2199/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2199\">Henry Bendix</a> was fired for defending Battalion’s rash decisions.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/222371-28951-jackson-king.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-222371\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.7142857142857\" data-width=\"154\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 154px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:271.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/222371-28951-jackson-king.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-222371\"><img alt=\"Battalion\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/222371-28951-jackson-king.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/222371-28951-jackson-king.jpg 154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px\" data-width=\"154\"></a><figcaption>Battalion</figcaption></figure><p>Battalion wasn’t convinced that what he saw in the future was unalterable. Though at first his knowledge of his death caused him to act recklessly to make what he had left count, at some point he decided to try to change the future instead of rushing headlong into it. He requested a leave of duty and while he was supposed to be off Skywatch, he snuck back on to kill his father who was in the Icebox, the absolute zero prison on the orbiting base. Unfortunately, Battalion was unable to pull the trigger. He was unable to kill the man he loved and still thought of as a hero in cold blood. So he left his father alive. He wouldn’t kill his father, but he wasn’t going to give up on stopping him; however, the visions of his future death started to haunt him more. While making modifications to his suit one day, Flashpoint provoked him and they got into a brawl that had been brewing for some time. Battalion had beaten his rival down when he was called in for a mission. He was sent to to stop <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/maul/4005-21968/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21968\">Maul</a>, who had been brainwashed by the Daemonite, <a href=\"/defile/4005-25775/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25775\">Defile</a>, from dropping a bomb in a volcano in order to sink the island and many others. Battalion beat Maul and took the bomb from him. There were seconds left before the timer ran out. <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/diva/4005-25774/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25774\">Diva</a> tried to get Battalion to somehow get rid of the bomb, but she was distracted by the arrival of Timespan who had come to make sure things happened the way they needed to. Diva didn’t reach Battalion. To protect his team and the island, he wrapped himself and the bomb in a force field to contain the explosion. The bomb went off and all that remained of Battalion were pieces of his suit.</p><p>The future Battalion had seen continued to become reality when Despot and the Warguard were released during <a href=\"/wildstorm-rising/4045-55885/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55885\">Wildstorm Rising</a>. Various Daemonite factions were fighting each other (and most of the super teams on Earth), in order to get their hands on a ship capable of getting back to <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/daemon/4020-61300/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-61300\">Daemon</a>. Disregarding Synergy’s protests, the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/united-nations/4060-57235/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57235\">UN</a> ordered the release of the Warguard so they could fight <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/helspont/4005-40632/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40632\">Helspont</a> and Defile. Of course Despot and his followers could not be controlled and once released, they left Stormwatch custody to carry out their own plans. More pieces fell into place after the events of Wildstorm Rising. The Daemonites didn’t get the ship but the WildC.A.T.S. did. No one knew this though, instead thinking the ship exploded and they died. Most of them left for <a href=\"/khera/4020-40910/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40910\">Khera</a>, but a damaged Spartan was left on Earth and was rebuilt in order to join the Stormwatch team for their next mission, capturing Despot. They failed and as a result Strafe turned evil, Diva was killed to be used as Despot’s puppet, and Spartan took her place as leader just as Battalion had foreseen. All these actions were leading up to the precise moment Battalion would appear from the past. Stormwatch’s only plan to defeat Despot was to lure him into Skywatch and crash it in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/death-valley/4020-57317/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57317\">Death Valley</a>, unbeknownst that as the satellite crashed, Battalion was being brought from the past to witness that act and be a part of what happened next. He met up with the team as they were searching the wreckage for devices. Link and Spartan had constructed devices that would protect them from Despot’s mind control. Since for them, Battalion had been dead for months. They thought he was some sort of trap. When they realized he was real and just displaced in time, they went on with their mission and Battalion joined them after trying to figure out what had happened. Stormwatch’s efforts were for nothing. Despot was in control of the fight. Without revealing himself, he dropped the entire team and sent Battalion's younger brother to fight him. Battalion defeated his brother only to come face to face with Despot. Isaiah revealed that he wanted to rid the world of free will and make everyone his slaves. Battalion tried to overcome his father by letting him into his mind to see the love that he still had for him despite what he had done. His plan failed but right before Despot killed him, Timespan sent him back into the past.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774659-2774657-jk1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2774659\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1062801932367\" data-width=\"207\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 207px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774659-2774657-jk1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2774659\"><img alt=\"Cybertran Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px\" data-width=\"207\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774659-2774657-jk1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774659-2774657-jk1.jpg 207w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cybertran Suit\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774659-2774657-jk1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2774659-2774657-jk1.jpg 207w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px\" data-width=\"207\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cybertran Suit</figcaption></figure><p>After Battalion disappeared into the past, no one was left conscious to stop Despot. Despot then turned his attention back to wiping the minds of everyone on the planet. Before he could do much, he was attacked from behind by none other than Battalion. Back before his fight with Flashpoint he had been modifying his suit to be able to teleport. When it seemed like he had died , he had really teleported to where Skywatch would land. Their Battalion spent all that time honing his psionic powers for his showdown with his father. Battalion was still outmatched. Not only was Despot a more powerful psychic, but he controlled all the fallen <a href=\"/spb/4015-44141/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44141\">SPB</a>s, both Stormwatch and WarGuard. Despot turned them all against Battalion. Battalion was able to defeat all his mind-controlled enemies and finally get Despot’s attention. Despot attacked Battalion with his own mind, bombarding him with his failures and weaknesses in an attempt to break him. In a turn of events, Battalion turned the attack back against Despot. Battalion overloaded Despot's mind with all his fears and inadequacies. At the end, Despot was on his knees and Bendix teleported in to finish him off. Bendix attack Despot but Despot managed to a moment to recover. Before Despot could attack, Bendix, Battalion and the now-freed Stormwatch members were teleported into a building. Despot found them quickly, but Battalion and Spartan (being the only ones Despot couldn’t take over), engaged him until came up with a plan to stop him for good. A short time after the battle, when Battalion had stopped mourning his dead father, he caught up with Timespan and tried to force some answers out of him, but only wound up tossed forward in time again.</p><p>Weeks later in normal time Battalion appeared again. While he had been gone, most of the Stormwatch regulars had taken leave to recover from the battle with Despot or just deal with personal things. Their replacement team had come into trouble against <a href=\"/heavens-fist/4060-54742/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54742\">Heaven’s Fist</a>, leaving two dead and the others, including Synergy, taken as hostages. Henry Bendix became The Weatherman once more. Benix had reassembled some of the older Stormwatch members and was preparing to send them off. Before he could do so, Battalion arrived and reclaimed his position as team leader. Under Battalion’s command they were able to rescue their teammates and stop Heaven’s Fist from setting off neutron bombs around the world.</p><p>During <a href=\"/fire-from-heaven/4045-55887/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55887\">Fire From Heaven</a>, Battalion and Flashpoint had their final showdown. Now it was revealed that Flashpoint had been working for Deathtrap for quite some time. Flashpoint had been Deathtrap's partner, not his prisoner. During the chaos of a larger battle, Flashpoint showed his true colors and was going to get revenge against Battalion. Flashpoint held animosity towards Battalion because Battalion had been picked to lead Stormwatch over him. Flash point tried to kill Battalion, instead, he lost his life as Battalion obliterated Flashpoint's head with a telekinetic blast.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33859/842317-stormwatch_battalion_v4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-842317\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.7540322580645\" data-width=\"248\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 248px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:175.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33859/842317-stormwatch_battalion_v4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-842317\"><img alt=\"Stormwatch Trainer\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px\" data-width=\"248\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33859/842317-stormwatch_battalion_v4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33859/842317-stormwatch_battalion_v4.jpg 248w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Stormwatch Trainer\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33859/842317-stormwatch_battalion_v4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33859/842317-stormwatch_battalion_v4.jpg 248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px\" data-width=\"248\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stormwatch Trainer</figcaption></figure><p>After the events of Fire From Heaven, and under the writing of <a href=\"/warren-ellis/4040-40893/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40893\">Warren Ellis</a>, Stormwatch underwent some changes. Henry Bendix took a firm, if somewhat brutal stance against the causes of evil. Bendix created new Stormwatch teams. Unfortunately Battalion wasn’t on any of them, instead he was made the training officer for other Stormwatch members. This was in order to separate him from Synergy (who had been made a field agent charged with activating Seedlings) so their relationship couldn’t be used against them or anyone else. Battalion was of course furious, but his emotional reaction only proved Bendix’s point, so he accepted the change. The way Stormwatch had changed didn’t set well with Battalion though, and on his limited dates with Christine on Earth, he would talk about the things he thought were questionable.</p><p>Despite his concerns Battalion kept doing his job, but when <a href=\"/the-high/4005-24389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24389\">The High</a> returned during the Change or Die story, things really did change. Jackson wasn’t directly involved for most of it, but his brother betrayed Stormwatch again, offering to feed information to The High and his people and then becoming their hostage. The situation ramped up when Bendix sent in Stormwatch to defeat the <a href=\"/the-changers/4060-44967/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44967\">Changers</a>, not because they were evil, but because they were going to change the world their way when he would only allow the world to be saved if it happened on his terms. Battalion wasn’t on the mission and found out from <a href=\"/winter/4005-55936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55936\">Winter</a>, not Bendix, that his brother was being held captive. Battalion put his problems with Bendix’s secrecy, and dubious motives and leadership, on hold, and went to go save his brother. It was Battalion that got <a href=\"/wish/4005-24317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24317\">Wish</a> to reveal what she had been doing and what she was planning. After she was killed (from Skywatch by Bendix) he walked into a room where most of the Stormwatch operatives were talking with the Changers and had almost worked things out. Things were not to go that easily though. On Skywatch, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jenny-sparks/4005-2203/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2203\">Jenny</a> was fighting a now-insane Henry Bendix and Battalion was surprised and taken down by <a href=\"/blind/4005-24316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24316\">Blind</a>, the other member of the Changers that had his own way of doing things. That set off <a href=\"/jack-hawksmoor/4005-2194/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2194\">Jack Hawksmoor</a> and just then the rest of Stormwatch arrived and things got out of hand. Before order could be established people on both sides died and the surviving Changers died as a result of the last order Henry Bendix had given before escaping Skywatch.</p><h3>The New Weatherman</h3><p>After Change or Die, Jackson King was unanimously elected to the position of Weatherman. His Stormwatch members consisted of Winter, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fahrenheit/4005-23660/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23660\">Fahrenheit</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hellstrike/4005-22460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22460\">Hellstrike</a> and Synergy. As Weatherman, made some changes to Stormwatch. He brought Synergy back to Skywatch and made the rest of the team back into public figures. Battalion even had Stormwatch members going to press conferences to speak to the media. He did keep Stormwatch Black, the covert team made up of Jenny Sparks, Jack Hawksmoor and <a href=\"/swift/4005-6021/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6021\">Swift</a>, but he denied their existence. Since Stormwatch had recently been banned from observing or acting in ???, he needed them for missions there as well as other places.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2776173-2776168-stormwatch_vol_2_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2776173\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.2980392156863\" data-width=\"510\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 510px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:229.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2776173-2776168-stormwatch_vol_2_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2776173\"><img alt=\"Weatherman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/50188/2776173-2776168-stormwatch_vol_2_10.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2776173-2776168-stormwatch_vol_2_10.jpg 510w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/50188/2776173-2776168-stormwatch_vol_2_10.jpg 417w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Weatherman\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/50188/2776173-2776168-stormwatch_vol_2_10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50188/2776173-2776168-stormwatch_vol_2_10.jpg 510w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/50188/2776173-2776168-stormwatch_vol_2_10.jpg 417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Weatherman</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, usually going by Weatherman, Battalion stepped into his role easily. His strategic thinking, seriousness, drive, discipline, and his own personality allowed him to be commanding and clearly in charge without alienating himself from his team members or losing himself under the burden of authority. In general, it made him an excellent leader. The only real problem he had with his people was when he refused to send his Stormwatch to save a parallel Earth because he didn’t feel like he had the right to interfere that much. Synergy supported him, but he had a falling out with Winter. That incident, along with other doubts Battalion had about previous operations he had run, caused him to question his leadership ability and his sanity. It didn’t help that in the alternate reality Jackson King had killed half of Skywatch trying to save it. He began to worry about making a catastrophic mistake.</p><p>When Skywatch found a rock floating in space, Battalion thought of events that had happened on the parallel world and how things had transpired. The rock turned out to be full of Aliens and they found their way onto Skywatch. There were many casualties, but Battalion was able to save almost 100 of his people, thanks to the assistance of the Wildcats and Winter’s sacrifice. Unfortunately, Skywatch was lost and Stormwatch was disbanded.</p><h3>The Monarchy</h3><p>In issue <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/stormwatch-phd-5/4000-142476/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-142476\">#5</a> of Stormwatch P.H.D.,Jackson King hints that all the things that happened in the \"Monarchy\" were the results of a drug-induced hallucionation.

Jackson did not hold his wife accountable for her actions because she was suffering from post partum depression.</p><h3>Authority Prime</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-733366\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9984375\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-733366\"><img alt=\"Jackson vs Midnighter\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg 1280w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jackson vs Midnighter\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg 1280w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/308/733366-ap03_000.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jackson vs Midnighter</figcaption></figure><p>\"Authority Prime\" was a six part mini-series.

The Earth was in ruins and Skywatch III was being used as a refugee camp for Earth's survivors. Skywatch III was totally disabled after Kheran bombers detonated their bombs from within. This lead to a battle between Stormwatch and a Kheran rebels who sought to re-make the Earth. Here we saw Jackson matched strength level with <a href=\"/sebastian/4005-69014/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69014\">Sebastian</a>; a <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mr-majestic/4005-21972/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21972\">Mr. Majestic</a> level opponent.</p><p>In World's End, Jackson King was not as level headed as he had been in previous Stormwatch series. He was very brash and at times appeared ruthless. His team mates were on edge when dealing with Jackson. (It is revealed later that he had been under the influence of former WildC.A.T. <a href=\"/tao/4005-4590/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4590\">Tao</a>). In this arc, Jackson's powers have increased and he has gone back to wearing his Battalion armor. Jackson has also grown out a full white beard.</p><p>Jackson eventually joins the WildC.A.T.s. in their efforts to save Earth. Jackson shaves his beard and dones a new armor (his new armor is lest bulky than the prior versions Jackson has worn). Jackson and <a href=\"/ladytron/4005-12011/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12011\">Ladytron</a> go on a mission to find the new <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/doctor/4005-2201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2201\">Doctor</a> of Earth. Battalion redeems himself of his past actions as excutes his missions with flawless execution.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Jackson King is a skilled telepath and telekinetic. On their own, his powers work on a small scale for more specific tasks. Battalion can disrupt individual minds, generate force fields, construct illusions, and manipulate small objects, atoms and particles.</p><p>As Battalion he was given a special Cybertran suit that amplified his abilities over 100 times and then focused them through guns. With the suit on his psionic powers are far more potent and can be used for large scale effects, such as crushing space ships and ripping apart multiple-mile wide space stations. His guns fire his amplified psionic abilities in a focused beam that causes physical and mental damage.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/91863-108847-jackson-king.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-91863\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3840830449827\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 289px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/91863-108847-jackson-king.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-91863\"><img alt=\"Psionic Weapons\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/91863-108847-jackson-king.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/91863-108847-jackson-king.jpg 289w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Psionic Weapons\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/91863-108847-jackson-king.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/91863-108847-jackson-king.jpg 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Psionic Weapons</figcaption></figure><p>Battalion is skilled at using his abilities through technology (for example, broadcasting telepathic and telekinetic attacks through connected devices). This may be a result of his use of the Cybertran suit, or it may just be that he knows how to use his psionics through physical systems. Battalion has also used his psionics to scan people to repair damage to their bodies.</p><p>Battalion possesses the unique ability to turn his psionic powers inward to increase his physical abilities to levels well above the 100 ton mark. Battalion may use this ability unconsciously at a low level since he has displayed superhuman reflexes without any visible psionic augmentation. After being shot in the head by his wife, new abilities started to show up, including the ability to see glimpses of the future. Jackson believes that the damage to his brain may have removed limits he had placed on himself in order to avoid becoming like his father, who while being a much more powerful psychic, was evil and insane.</p><p>Some displays of Battalion's psionic abilities include:</p><ul><li>Telepathic communication</li><li>Thought reading</li><li>Memory reading</li><li>Mind detection</li><li>Psi-blasts (capable of erasing minds)</li><li>Psi-shields (other uses of TK include for-fitting restraints/immobilization)</li><li>Psi-scanning (of physical conditions for healing)</li><li>Illusions (has one up 24/7 to cover wounds, can project images of himself)</li><li>Increased reflexes</li><li>Strength amplification</li><li>Routing psychic powers through circuitry</li><li>Manipulation of electricity</li><li>Flight</li></ul><p>In addition to his psychic abilities, Battalion is an excellent hand to hand combatant and more than capable leader. During his time in Stormwatch, Battalion has become knowledgeable about the workings of advanced technology, mostly due to time spent improving his Cyber-Tran suit. Battalion is also a skilled pilot.</p><h3>Personality</h3><p>Battalion has a strong personality and rightfully so. He is powerful both physically and mentally. Battalion is intelligent and good at what he does. Despite the fact that he would be justified in taking control of any situation, he is not quick to impose himself on others just for his own sake. His Leadership assertions changed after he became Weatherman. While he may make some rash decisions where he himself is concerned, he always makes the right choices when others are involved. Battalion puts the well being of his team (and friends) above any orders or his own safety. He fears becoming his father and often reflects on himself and his past. This causes him to recount his failures. These things bring doubt into his mind on occasion, but he works to not let that overcome him. He's mentally tough and excels at doing what is right.</p><p>After the defeat of Despot, Battalion has come to terms with himself and is less troubled by feelings of inadequacy. He is a thoughtful man with tons of character. He sees value in all life, even villains. Battalion is very reluctant to kill even his worst enemies. He will seek an alternate option before deciding to use lethal force. Battalion is focused on protecting other. He cares for people beyond his close friends.The burden of leadership and power is great, but Battalion has shown that he is more than capable to bear it.</p><h3>Relationships</h3><p><a href=\"/despot/4005-25874/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25874\">Despot</a>: Isaiah King is Jackson King’s father. He was aboard Monitor One when the comet went by and along with the other scientist on the satellite, was the closest to the changing affects that it brought. He was granted the greatest powers, gargantuan psionic abilities and also underwent a great personality change. It’s unclear if it was a direct result of the comet or if he now had the power to do something about fears that plagued him his whole life, but Isaiah became Despot, and planned to take over the world to make it the way he wanted it. loved his father and had a few opportunities to kill him and didn’t take them until it was absolutely necessary. He hated the evil in his father, but never the man he had been, and when he was finally killed, his sadness was immense.</p><p><a href=\"/strafe/4005-25825/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25825\">Strafe</a>: Malcolm King is ’s younger brother. Malcolm has a knack for falling in with the wrong crowd and making the wrong choices. does his best to keep him out of trouble and situations that might become bad (which is why he didn’t want him to be a part of Stormwatch) and rides him very hard when he messes up, but he loves his brother.</p><p><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/synergy/4005-23395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23395\">Synergy</a>: Though they would never admit it at the time, Jackson King and Christine Trelane had feelings for each other since they first started working together on Skywatch.</p><p><a href=\"/backlash/4005-25978/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25978\">Backlash</a>: Backlash was Battalion’s trainer all the way through the Stormwatch Program, and until Battalion became the leader of the team, he followed Backlash. They grew close not only as teammates but friends.</p><p><a href=\"/flashpoint/4005-25138/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25138\">Flashpoint</a>: Flashpoint was Battalion’s rival for Stormwatch Prime leadership at the beginning of the Stormwatch program. Because of that (and the fact that Flashpoint is an unashamed racist) their relationship was difficult. The animosity was mostly one-way though, with Flashpoint disliking and always trying to provoke Battalion. Things only got worse when Battalion was finally given the leadership position. They were able to work as a team despite that though, and did so up until that fateful mission in where it seemed that Flashpoint and the others had died. When they were discovered alive years later, having been imprisoned that whole time, Stormwatch of course rescued them, but Flashpoint put all the blame for their years of torture on Battalion, even though he had wanted to try to go back for them years earlier in Kuwait and had broken the chain of command when he found out they were alive and finally did save them. Flashpoint’s hatred for Battalion would never subside and he challenged him whenever he got the opportunity, and secretly planned to kill him. Battalion put an end to the rivalry (and Flashpoint) during Fire From Heaven.</p>",

Each of these Constructs were composed of machine colonies that mated in order to give birth to smaller and better machinery as they evolved. As a result, each creche of such machines continued to work and mate in this manner leading to volumetric expansion at an exponential rate. Thus, each of these Hollowers were capable of incredible destruction with them being able to annihilate a planet or a galaxy in the span of hours.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60408/1152868-p00010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1152868\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5470297029703\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60408/1152868-p00010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1152868\"><img alt=\"E.A armor\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60408/1152868-p00010.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60408/1152868-p00010.jpg 404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\"></a><figcaption>E.A armor</figcaption></figure><p>The Justice Society of America staged an assault against Imperiex's mothership where they succeeded in destroying it thus crippling the production of more Probes.

    "deck": "Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus, better known as Gaius Caesar or Caligula, was the third Roman emperor, a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and reigned from 37 to 41. Historical sources received have made him known for his extravagance, eccentricity and depravity, handing down an image of a despot.",
    "description": "<p> The historical sources <br /><br />The problem of sources in the case of the emperor Caligula, is a complex issue. The Lives of the Caesars by Suetonius is the main script where you can get information on his reign. However, as well as other documents handed down to us (such as the writings of Dio Cassius Cocceio), the writings of Suetonius tend to focus on anecdotes about the supposed cruelty and mental instability of Caligula, and some modern historians have expressed doubts about the reliability of these reports (Suetonius devotes nine chapters of his biography in Prince Caligula Caligula and 39 monster).<br /><br />It was certainly a character discussed, very popular among the Roman people but against the political class and the class from which they came to historians. Unfortunately it is not come down to us on the part of Caligula Annals of Tacitus, the historian of the period generally considered more rigorous.<br /><br />The most important news to the appearance of Caligula comes from Suetonius. It appears that came to six feet tall, he was almost bald (at least in the last years of his reign), and that his eyes were sunken and insightful. It was a great charioteer (driver of chariots), with an agile and physically.<br /><br />Biography<br /><br />Sources familiar<br /><br />Caligula ('little murky, \"the shoes of the legionaries, affectionate nickname given to him at a young age by the soldiers of his father Germanicus) was the third son of Germanicus and Agrippina Major, general much loved by the Roman people. His father was the son of Drusus major (brother of Tiberius and son of Livia, wife of Augustus) and Antonia Minor (daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia, sister of Augustus). The mother was the daughter of Marcus Agrippa Vipsanio (friend of Augustus) and Julia (daughter of first marriage of Augustus).<br /><br />Also his father Germanicus was adopted by Tiberius, which was adopted by Augustus, who in turn was adopted by Julius Caesar.<br /><br />This particular family situation (which could go up by Augustus Caesar, and then even to the very origins of Rome, Aeneas and Venus) made Caligula, the most likely successor to Tiberius.<br /><br />Youth <br /><br />As a boy accompanied his parents on military expeditions in Germany (14 - 16) and wore the shoes in the fields of legionnaires (Caliga), hence the affectionate nickname \"Caligula\", given to him by the soldiers.<br /><br />In the 17th, after witnessing the triumph of his father in Rome, share with family in the wake of Germany sent on a mission to East. Only two years later his father died, and Caligula, with her mother, he returned to Italy.<br /><br />The hypothesis advanced by some to Caligula in seven years had been guilty of the death of his father in Syria is not supported by historical sources.<br /><br />In 27 will live at home paternal great-grandfather of Livia on the Palatine Hill and 29 at the home of her grandmother Antonia Minor where he will meet the three young princes Thracians, Polemon II (which will give the kingdom of Pontus and the Bosporus), Rhoimetalkes (which give half of the ancient kingdom of Thrace) and Kotys III (which will give the Lesser Armenia).<br /><br />The emperor Tiberius retired to Capri in 26 already, he wants to Caligula in 31, when it became Pontifex (priest). In 33 he became superintendent, and here you close the cursus honorum of Caligula.<br /><br />Tiberius nevertheless appoint his successors in his will (35) Twin Caligula and Tiberius.<br /><br />He had four wives: Junia Claudilla, Livia Orestilla, Lollia Paulina, already married to Publius Memmius Caesonia Regulus and Milo, who bore him a daughter named Julia Drusilla in honor of her sister died<br /><br />Accession to the throne <br /><br />After the death of Tiberius, which occurred March 16 to 37, the Senate will stop the test, leaving the leadership of the Empire to Tiberius and Caligula Twin, nephew of the late emperor, saying that as of this writing Tiberius was insane and declared Caligula Imperator 18 March 37. Caligula came to power with the support of all: the Senate, army and people. The reasons for this approval are different: his young age (25 years coming), the popularity of his father, the length of the reign of Tiberius (23 years), childhood spent in the camps, the misfortune of his family, relationship with both Mark Antony and Augustus, with his devotion to family.<br /><br />The principality (37-41) <br /><br />Domestic Policy <br /><br />It was thought that Caligula would have continued the policy of his father, Germanicus, but it did not. The short reign of Caligula was characterized by a series of massacres against domestic opponents and from acts that tended to a constant humiliation of the senatorial class. Caligula was acting very strange ways that identified him as a \"crazy\". Ancient sources saw him as an example of \"bloody madness\". According to legend, in fact, the senator named his horse (named Incitatus), although it is clear that its decree appointing expressed his utter contempt for the Senate might well have been enriched by his beast. In fact only a joke Caligula once said that he could appoint his horse as a senator, this being more capable of the senators themselves.<br /><br />Other stories show that he had frequent bouts of anger. Tacitus recounts that during a banquet, Caligula suddenly burst out laughing. A diner who was sitting with him asked him why he laughed and said that Caligula was thinking that the latter's death after he killed. Caligula adopted a policy of monarchical absolutism, he wanted to become a sovereign divine honors which made the model of oriental monarchies, exhausting the known process of deification of dead emperors. Caligula became autocratic attitudes and demanded that a temple was erected. He became popular with expensive gifts to the populace and circus games.<br /><br />If the emperors before him had opted, at least in the western part of the empire, to maintain ties with the republican tradition of Roman power, he veered dramatically to the east, towards a form of absolute power at that time still unknown in Italy, anticipating thus become a major trend among the Roman emperors from the third century of our era.<br /><br />The new emperor, to avoid problems dynastic named Tiberius Twin princeps iuventutis and adopted him, naming him his heir. To avoid, however, that Tiberius Twin claim that it was co-regent, 38 had him killed or led him to suicide. The same fate befell the praetorian prefect Macro. Caligula probably did not trust some people more than they could, with their power, money or charisma, delete it. More than cruelty in this case, we can talk about Machiavellian politics of this young man.<br /><br />According to sources, Caligula, at the height of his reign, he wanted to be God could be proclaimed the umpteenth manifestation of his madness, or a subtle policy to increase its power in the Hellenistic peoples, long accustomed to consider their sovereign deity. In short, the attempt of a religious young prince to keep power by all means. This, however, caused much discontent, especially in populations that already had problems with the simple civil authority of Rome, not to mention the religious one, for example the Jews, which triggered heavy movements of revolt<br /><br />Contemporary explanation of the Emperor's New Groove<br /><br />Recent studies trace the strange events of Caligula and other emperors, like lead poisoning, which in technical terms is called lead poisoning. Lead poisoning is caused by Caligula's ancient Roman custom of drinking wine, holding it slightly softened skins of lead. With respect to Roman pipes of lead, which is mentioned in some articles, do not cause lead poisoning, because the water formed a thin layer of oxide of lead white, insoluble in water, while the slight acidity of this wine was dissolved salt, that is just sweet.<br /><br />Economic and financial management<br /><br />On the death of Tiberius in the coffers of the Roman fiscus were 2,700,000,000 sesterces [2] Caligula expenses in a year or so. Some of the costs incurred by the new emperor were inevitable: the various gifts to the people, the army, the Praetorian Guard (to which he gave a donation twice that promised by Tiberius, 2000 sesterces a head [3]) and the vassal kingdoms of Rome ( 100,000,000 sesterces to those of Antiochus IV of Commagene). Do not forget also that respected the will of Tiberius, Caligula, although it was formally annulled by the Senate, and gave the set at all. Should not forget the huge banquets and various organizations to keep calm and good people. All this is added, however, other extravagances, cited by contemporary historians, as the stable of his horse all in ivory and marble, the 2 million sesterces donated to a charioteer and a million donated to Livio Gemini (who swore they saw Drusilla ascend into heaven, and converse with the gods). It should also be mentioned the abolition of tax on sales.<br /><br />And to improve the economic situation Caligula, like many later emperors, expropriated the assets of many senators, accusing them of plotting against him (not always a false accusation).<br /><br />Modern historians tend to discount the voices that speak of a critical financial state coffers, as presented by the ancient sources, since it does not explain either the decrease of tax burden took place under his rule, nor one that occurred under his immediate successor.<br /><br />Judiciary <br /><br />Several acts were interesting features of this emperor, the abolition, in the first year of government, the law of treason, an act much hated by the senators, however, reintroduced in 39. Also interesting is the project implemented in 38 of the elections and return to the courts, at least formally, the ancient prerogatives, with the direct consequence that the people elect the magistrates. In general we can divide the judicial policy of this emperor in two periods, the first very liberal, pro-People, in which it sought an agreement with the senators and the second in which the princeps did everything to maintain power.<br /><br />Foreign Policy<br /><br />With the reigns allies did not follow the same policy, was based a lot on the sympathy and trust that each ruler was able to convey. Exiled Mithridates, king of Armenia, and sent to death Ptolemy, king of Mauritania, and reduced his kingdom to province, appointed king of Commagene, a region reduced to a province in 18, Antiochus IV, who gave 100 million sesterces.<br /><br />Kingdoms also gave the three young princes Thracians who had met in his youth, to grandmother's house Antonia: a Polemon II will give the kingdom of Pontus and the Bosporus in 38 to Rhoimetalkes half of the ancient kingdom of Thrace and the Kotys Armenia Minor.<br /><br />He helped in every way Herod Agrippa, who entrusted to him, at first, the north-western Palestine, which after the death of Herod Philip II (34) was under the direct control of Rome, later also the territories of the tetrarch of Galilee, Herod Antipas, who was accused of wanting to seize the territories of Herod Agrippa, who will be exiled and then eliminated in the first 40.<br /><br />Military Policy<br /><br />Caligula had important ancestors who had earned the glory of war with business, it is likely, therefore, it was determined to emulate their deeds and in the case to overcome them. If more Drusus and Germanicus had focused on Germany, he had to overcome their deeds, not only to gain the same region, but crossed the ocean to arrive in Britain. It would have been the first emperor Augustus after the campaigns in Spain in 26-25 BC to lead an army into battle.<br /><br />According to Suetonius he did levers throughout the empire and amassed a large quantity of food. According to Dio Cassius, he enlisted for his exploits between 200 and 250 000 men. In 39 Caligula suppressed a revolt among his troops and marched towards the Rhine in the high northern coast of Gaul, apparently intending to invade Britain. Instead, he ordered the troops to get in the water looking for shells, as Suetonius tells us, or more probably gave up a shipment badly prepared.<br /><br />Death <br /><br />Caligula was assassinated in a conspiracy led by two Praetorian tribunes, Cornelius Sabinus and Cassius Cherea, January 24 to 41. With him died his wife Miloni Caesonia and their baby daughter, Julia Drusilla (named in memory of the sister of Caligula he deified his death) that was brutally crushed against a wall. He was succeeded by his uncle Claudius, who, reportedly has been hiding behind a curtain.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>John Wilkes Booth was the ninth child of acclaimed English actor Junius Brutus Booth and his mistress Mary Ann Holmes. He was born on May 10th, 1838 and raised in rural <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55750\" href=\"/maryland/4020-55750/\">Maryland</a>. Like several of his brothers (most notably Edwin), he followed in his father's footsteps and became an actor at the age of 17, finding much acclaim on the American stage. <br /> <br />Prior to the Civil War he was strongly opposed to abolitionist actions, even becoming a member of the volunteer militia. He was vocally pro-<a data-ref-id=\"4060-56446\" href=\"/confederate-army/4060-56446/\">Confederate</a>, and equally vocal in his hatred for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14131\" href=\"/abraham-lincoln/4005-14131/\">President Abraham Lincoln</a> throughout the war. Booth blamed the president for the problems suffered in the South, and for dividing the country in civil war. Though he had initially been formulating a plan to kidnap Lincoln, Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House drove Booth to instead consider assassination. <br /><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2> On April 14th, 1865, Booth learned that President and Mrs. Lincoln intended to attend a showing of the play <i>Our American Cousin</i> at the Ford Theatre later that night. As a well-respected actor and friend of the theatre's owner, John Ford, Booth was able to enter the theatre without arousing suspicion. At around 10 o'clock, Booth entered the presidential box and shot Lincoln in the back of the head. Leaping down to the stage, he yelled <i>\"sic semper tyrannis\" </i>(\"thus always to tyrants\"), and possibly also \"I have done it, the South is avenged!\" before fleeing the theatre.   <br /><br />He and his confederate were hunted down by Union troops and cornered in the Garret barn twelve days after the assassination. Already injured, possibly after jumping to the stage and possibly during the escape, Booth refused to surrender to the surrounding troops, who set fire to the barn in order to force him out. He was then shot by Sergeant Boston Corbett, who managed to hit him the neck, paralyzing Booth. The soldiers dragged him to the porch of the farmhouse, where he whispered, \"tell my mother I died for my country\", and, gazing at his hands, \"useless, useless\". He died at dawn at 26 years of age.    <br /><h2>In Other Media</h2> John Wilkes Booth has become a figure of fascination in the American consciousness, and has as such made numerous appearances in various media, including comic books. He has appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4010-10\" href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\">DC</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4010-31\" href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\">Marvel</a> comics, as well as in independent books. <br />He has also been the subject of numerous books, both fiction and non-fiction, many of which have dealt with his motivation in the assassination of Lincoln, as well as focusing on his personal life. <br />He appeared as one of the major characters in the Stephen Sondheim musical <i>Assassins,</i> where the role was originated by Canadian actor Victor Garber, and revived on Broadway by American actor Michael Cerveris.",

However they may have grains of truth to them: </p><p>In the first story, Ira is an orphan on a war-torn world. A prostitute takes him under her wings until she dies. Then he is abducted by the <a href=\"/gl-doses/4060-61181/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61181\">G’L-Doses</a> (more on them below).</p><p>In the second story, Ira lives on a sex-obsessed world. Everything is constantly fornicating, except when it is filling it’s life with some other hedonistic pleasure. He was happy, until the G’L-Doses took him.</p><p>In the third story, Ira is a gay man from Brooklyn, with a bad marriage and family. He is unhappy with everything. He puts on a fuzzy Halloween costume and is caught by the G’L-Doses, who trap him in the costume.</p><p>It is clear, however, that his early life was unhappy and gave him a clear fear and distaste for war. He was not very healthy before his abduction.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Zoo</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193716-scan+33.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193716\" data-ratio=\"1.2458193979933\" data-width=\"598\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 598px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193716-scan+33.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193716\"><img alt=\"Ira at the Zoo\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193716-scan+33.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193716-scan+33.jpeg 598w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193716-scan+33.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Ira at the Zoo</figcaption></figure><p>Regardless of what his life was like before, one day Ira is abducted by the G’L-Doses and put in <a href=\"/the-zoo/4020-59886/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59886\">the Zoo</a> along with the many other aliens they caught. There, the G’L-Doses provide him with an unending lifespan and his health is normalized. He is a tall, fuzzy alien who is completely self-indulgent and a slave to his desires, which mostly revolve around porn, beer, and flatulence. He often wears a bowler hat and smokes a cigar. </p><p>After Ira has been at the Zoo for at least a hundred years, an Earth boy named Moonshadow is born there. As Moon grows, he is attracted to Ira as a father figure. Ira is a major grouch so he puts him off, but Moon brings him an immense collection of porn from his dome’s library, and Ira decides to tolerate him.</p><p>One day Moon’s father, one of the G’L-Doses, decides to let Moon out of the Zoo for an adventure. He sends Ira with him, over Ira’s objections. Moon’s cat, <a href=\"/frodo/4005-12036/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12036\">Frodo</a>, and his mother, <a href=\"/sunflower/4005-109182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109182\">Sunflower</a>, come too. The G’L-Doses provide them with a ship, the <a href=\"/the-decrepit/4055-58393/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-58393\">Decrepit</a>, and they fly off into space. Ira is majorly freaked out at losing his life at the Zoo, where he could focus on his hedonistic desires all day long.</p><h3>Early Adventures</h3><p>When they run into a fleet running away from a sector filled with plague, Ira tries to get them to take him with them, but fails. Sick of the Romantic views of Moon and Sunflower, he wants to get out. He even tries to take over the ship’s computer when they leave to save a ship broadcasting a distress call, to no avail. He reluctantly joins them, but runs away when danger appears.</p><p>Sunflower dies in the sortie, and Moon brings her to the mall world of <a href=\"/gimmegimme/4020-59887/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59887\">Gimmegimme</a> for a funeral at <a href=\"/jobidiah/4005-12047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12047\">Jobidiah Unkshuss</a>’s funeral palace. Ira doesn’t care, and wants to get rid of him, so he starts a riot between the Mourners’ Guild, which is on strike, and their scabs at the funeral. Moonshadow is nabbed by some insane asylum workers in the chaos, and Ira seems to be free of his naïve young companion.</p><p>He tries to get the Decrepit and fly off, but finds that Moon put it in hock for the funeral. He needs a lot of money to get it back, so he infiltrates the asylum (also owned by Jobidiah) dressed like a nurse and frees Moon. Moon doesn’t know that Ira started the riot that got him into the asylum, so he’s happy to see him again. Ira fakes friendliness and forces Moon to take numerous terrible jobs to pay for the ship. Ira tends to spend the money on beer and hookers, however. Eventually Ira decides they need to make a big theft to make enough money: they need to steal the Godsegg. Moon, still an innocent, can’t lower himself to steal, but Ira won’t accept this, and beats him badly, castigating him for taking him away from the Zoo. Moon finally agrees to do it out of loneliness, and wanting to make his father figure proud.</p><p>Moon manages to take it, but is chased by the police. Ira has no loyalty, however, and knocks Moon on the head and takes the Godsegg himself. Moon begins to realize that he has been idealizing Ira. In the end, both are caught, and given a choice: 200 years in jail or the Machovian army. Moon, full of Romantic ideas of war, is excited. Ira, who seems to have had bad experiences with war in the past, is far from it. Moonshadow never learns what these past experiences were, but when their general, <a href=\"/general-carollian-lunace/4005-109193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109193\">Carollian Lunace</a>, gives a speech to boost their morale, Ira calls him a lair and attacks him. After they are returned to quarters, he acts like a “castrated dog” and lurks about, whimpering, and even praying on his knees in apparent fear. </p><h3>War</h3><p>They are sent on a dangerous mission to <a href=\"/bingbangboom/4020-59889/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59889\">Bingbangboom</a> to stop a man with a doomsday weapon. However when part of their squad enters the castle of the enemy, they find <a href=\"/lord-gaylord/4005-12042/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12042\">Lord Gaylord</a>. He doesn’t actually have a weapon, but just said so to keep both armies away. Instead he runs a secret retreat for all those who love peace. Ira is happy for a while, but ultimately decides the palace is just another Zoo. And while until now he has been saying he just wanted to go back, now he wants to be free. He leaves, and Moon follows.</p><p>They leave with the rest of their squad to the next planet at war, <a href=\"/tsuris/4020-59888/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59888\">Tsuris</a>. This planet is full of battle, and Moon and Ira are separated and both wounded. Moon finally finds the unconscious Ira with the help of the ghosts of his dead mother and her boyfriend, <a href=\"/moonshadow-the-elder/4005-109195/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109195\">Moonshadow the elder</a>, whom she named him after.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193729-scan+85.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193729\" data-ratio=\"0.52620320855615\" data-width=\"935\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 935px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193729-scan+85.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193729\"><img alt=\"Ira defends Moonshadow\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193729-scan+85.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193729-scan+85.jpeg 935w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193729-scan+85.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Ira defends Moonshadow</figcaption></figure><p>Moon carries Ira until they are caught by the enemy army, the Goyimians, and brought to a concentration camp. The other inmates are worried about a lack of food, and turn on the weak Moonshadow. Ira, finally feeling some loyalty and friendship towards Moon after their close combat experiences, warns them off and bloodily pulls off one of their arms to keep them away. Ira then surprisingly stays by Moon’s bedside for days, tending to him tenderly, even praying once again.</p><p>After that, Ira continued to berate Moon whenever he got the chance, but they were now bonded in close friendship.</p><p>Moon eventually befriends the camp leader, <a href=\"/darkmeister-ebann/4005-12048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12048\">Darkmeister Ebann</a>, and gets Ira and their squadmates <a href=\"/horntoad/4005-109192/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109192\">Horntoad</a> and <a href=\"/rigarollo/4005-109191/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109191\">Rigarollo</a> to join him in putting on plays for the leader. However Ebann eventually turns on them and sentences them to execution by being dipped into boiling vats.</p><p>Ira is first dropped in, but he releases an enormous fart that, incredibly, launches him out of the vat. It seems the G’L-Doses enhanced the power of his flatulence to achieve this effect. In the ensuing chaos the whole squad escapes. Ira is hailed as a hero by the other prisoners, and he and his squad are sent to the Machovian palace for awards. </p><h3>A Hero</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193732-scan+115.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193732\" data-ratio=\"1.1969696969697\" data-width=\"660\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 660px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193732-scan+115.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193732\"><img alt=\"Ira and some ladies of the palace\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193732-scan+115.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193732-scan+115.jpeg 660w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193732-scan+115.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ira and some ladies of the palace\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193732-scan+115.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193732-scan+115.jpeg 660w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193732-scan+115.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ira and some ladies of the palace</figcaption></figure><p>Ira, however, becomes reclusive and inwardly-focused. His unhappiness with war makes him equally unhappy to accept awards for it. At the palace, they meet the king and queen, and also the Unkshuss family, Jobidiah and his siblings <a href=\"/mobidiah/4005-12039/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12039\">Mobidiah</a> and <a href=\"/flobidiah/4005-12040/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12040\">Flobidiah</a>, and their tyrant father <a href=\"/pobidiah/4005-12041/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12041\">Pobidiah</a>. The Unkshusses are the power behind the throne, since they control both the economy and the religion of the empire. Mobidiah spearheads an interest among them to get Ira on their side. They get him drinks and women, and eventually manage to turn him back into the morally vacant, dissolute Ira that he was before the war. They clear his head by finally providing him with all the empty pleasure that he’s been missing since the Zoo, and fill it back up again with dreams of easy glory and more pleasure. He writes Moon a good-bye note and leaves with them on a tour of the galaxy, giving speeches about his bravery during the war.</p><p>The Unkshusses want him to do this because the war makes them a lot of money, and the war is on the wane, thanks to the peace-making efforts of Lord Gaylord. They hope Ira’s speeches will bring hype up support for the war among the population.</p><p>Unfortunately, they are not content to merely convince Ira to give speeches through their gifts of alcohol and women. Once they are on tour, Mobidiah’s thuggish side comes through. He poisons Ira’s food, locks him in a cage and beats him into submission, day in and day out. Ira becomes little more than an animal. Then Mobidiah uses a mind-control helmet to make Ira parrot back Mobidiah’s words. Flobidiah helps her brother, but unenthusiastically. She is the only good-hearted Unkshuss, and falls in love with Ira. </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193733-scan+135.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193733\" data-ratio=\"0.51138952164009\" data-width=\"878\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 878px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193733-scan+135.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193733\"><img alt=\"A billboard for Ira's talks\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193733-scan+135.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193733-scan+135.jpeg 878w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193733-scan+135.jpeg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A billboard for Ira's talks\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193733-scan+135.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193733-scan+135.jpeg 878w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193733-scan+135.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A billboard for Ira's talks</figcaption></figure><p>Moon is alerted to Ira’s situation by the G’L-Doses, and he flies off to rescue him. He sees him giving one of his jingoistic speeches. Not knowing about the mind-control, he is stunned that the anti-war Ira would be so supportive of the war. Moon confronts him angrily, but walks away after he gets no answer from Ira. He slips off and eavesdrops at the Unkshuss’s door, and learns how they have been controlling him. Flobidiah notices Moon and lets him take Ira away. Over many days, Moon is slowly able to bring Ira back to consciousness by playing his flute and telling him stories. </p><h3>Recovery and Finality</h3><p>They go back to <a href=\"/pillbox/4020-59890/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59890\">Pillbox</a>, where Moon had lived happily when Ira was on tour. There they find his home destroyed and Lord Gaylord apparently killed. Moon is crushed, and Ira sinks back into gluttony. They fly off, and Ira takes control as Moon sinks into despondency. He takes them to I.H.O.T.: <a href=\"/interplanetary-house-of-tarts/4020-59892/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59892\">the Interplanetary House of Tarts</a>. There, he books the virgin Moonshadow with a prostitute for the night, and himself with a stream of women for more than a week. His mind and emotions ground to the bone from his terrible experiences, he dives into violent sex until he can no longer move, burning all his sadness and burdens away, and trying to find the core of himself that the Unkshusses had destroyed.</p><p>As they leave I.H.O.T., they are caught by the Unkshusses and put in Pobidiah’s dungeons. Pobidiah threatens to kill them unless they convert to his religion and confess their “sins.” Ira is still withdrawn through their interrogation until Pobidiah threatens to shoot Moonshadow. Then Ira summons up his strength and rips their chains from the wall. Moon gets Pobidiah’s gun, shoots him, and they escape, Ira still protecting him from the guards, his loyalty and friendship to Moon once more apparent. On the way they find Flobidiah, whose love for him still burns strong. She helps them out. Eventually, the rightful <a href=\"/queen-dibbich/4005-12045/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12045\">queen</a> of Machovia manages to arrest the male Unkshusses for their crimes, and Moon and Ira are announced as heroes once again. Flobidiah now stays with Ira, taking care of him; his health once again is in poor shape.</p><p>They receive a letter from Gaylord, who may not be dead after all, saying that he found the fabled mystic, Shree Quack-Quack H’onnka, on the mystic <a href=\"/world-of-mists/4020-59891/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59891\">Planet of Mists</a>. Moon, Ira, and Flobidiah race off to see if they can find Gaylord. </p><p>They don’t find Gaylord, but they do find a number of pilgrims and believers in H’onnka’s religion. Ira’s health, meanwhile, goes from bad to worse. He wasn’t healthy before being brought to the Zoo, and his experiences in the war, with Mobidiah, and at I.H.O.T. have brought him to the point where he is slowly dying. Moon won’t accept it, but Flobidiah tries to comfort him.</p><p>In extremis, Ira finally accepts that there may be something to life other than beer and porn, and starts reading the Gospel of H’onnka. It seems to fill a hole in his soul that had been empty for years, and which he had occasionally tried to fill through short attempts at prayer a few times before.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193742-scan+175.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193742\" data-ratio=\"1.1867612293144\" data-width=\"423\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 423px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193742-scan+175.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193742\"><img alt=\"Ira's grave\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193742-scan+175.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193742-scan+175.jpeg 423w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193742-scan+175.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ira's grave\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193742-scan+175.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193742-scan+175.jpeg 423w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193742-scan+175.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ira's grave</figcaption></figure><p>The next day he meets a mysterious figure, possibly H’onnka himself, who gives him some fruit, even though there is none around.

Moonshadow and his mom are released from the zoo-along with his best friend <a href=\"/ira/4005-12034/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12034\">Ira</a> (a perverted degenerate alien who despite himself is fond of the little shit) and his faithful cat <a href=\"/frodo/4005-12036/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12036\">Frodo</a>. After a disastrous rescue attempt Sunflower dies. Moonshadow, Ira and Frodo sojourn across the galaxy witnessing madness, destitution, war, betrayal, death, the wonders of sex and many more revelations and strange encounters beside. Moonshadow’s only constant companion is Frodo, who still remains by his side 100 years later as he recounts upon his strange life and writes his story.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moonshadow is born in the <a href=\"/the-zoo/4020-59886/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59886\">Zoo</a>, which was built by the mysterious and whimsical alien race, the G’L-Doses, to house specimens of the many beings they abducted from around the universe. His mother is Sunflower (aka Sheila Fay Bernbaum), a hippie from Earth, and his father is one of the G’L-Doses; this is the only known union between one of the G.D.s and another species. His mother’s sister was <a href=\"/esther-bernbaum/4005-12050/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12050\">Aunt Ettie</a>, who went insane and died before Moon was born. She had a certain color of blue eyes that both Sheila and Moon share, and through which family tradition says her madness is passed down. His mother’s father was <a href=\"/martin-bernbaum/4005-12049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12049\">Martin Bernbaum</a>, a philosophical trash collector from Brooklyn.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4193373\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193373-scan+38.jpeg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.70179372197309\" data-width=\"892\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 892px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193373-scan+38.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193373\"><img alt=\"Moon in his library\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193373-scan+38.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193373-scan+38.jpeg 892w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193373-scan+38.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px\" data-width=\"892\"></a><figcaption>Moon in his library</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon was named after a San Francisco poet that Sunflower loved, and who died in the Vietnam war.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a youth, Moon mostly played with his mother’s cat, Frodo, and read in their library. This library was provided by the G’L-Doses to Sunflower upon her request, one of the few requests honored by the G.D.s. It contained all sorts of Romantic and adventure stories, which Moon devoured.</p><figure style=\"width: 951px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198893-scan+32.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198893\" data-ratio=\"0.47003154574132\" data-width=\"951\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:47.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198893-scan+32.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198893\"><img alt=\"Moon and Frodo meet Ira in the Zoo\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198893-scan+32.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198893-scan+32.jpeg 951w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198893-scan+32.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Moon and Frodo meet Ira in the Zoo</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As he grew older, he sought out the companionship of Ira, a completely debauched fuzzy alien who had no interest in Moonshadow at all. However, Moon saw him as a sort of father figure, and kept pursuing him, eventually offering him alien porn from the library. At this gift, Ira finally consented to Moon’s presence.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Innocence Lost</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon’s Journey to Awakening, as he termed it in his old age (the story of Moonshadow is narrated by himself when he is an old man), begins when his father, the G’L-Doses, appears to him for the first time and says it is time for the fourteen-year-old Moon to leave. He teleports Moon, Ira, Sunflower, and Frodo to a space ship, the <a href=\"/the-decrepit/4055-58393/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-58393\">Decrepit</a>, with the traditional G’L-Doses sound effects, Pop! Poof! Ping! Moon mans the helm and excitedly takes them in search of adventure.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After a few weeks they run into a group of ships fleeing the Kickapoo Cluster, because it has been infested by the Pewkadook Plague. The craven Ira wants to leave immediately, but Sunflower insists they help anyone in need. Moon listens to his mother and takes them in to a planet beaming out a distress signal. They find a sick alien inside, about to give birth. Sunflower feels empathy for the alien woman, and helps deliver the child, but tragically it is a monster, and in its first act gnaws through Sheila Fay’s guts. They retreat to the ship, but she is mortally wounded. She gives Moon her flute, which was originally Mad Aunt Ettie’s, and which is a symbol of art, life, and spirit. Then she dies. This is the first of many steps in the loss of Moon’s innocence and Romantic ideals, and the first of many deaths that he will encounter. It is his fifteenth birthday. His father appears, cruelly smiles, and disappears.</p><figure style=\"width: 468px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4194254\" data-ratio=\"0.97222222222222\" data-width=\"468\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4194254\"><img alt=\"Moon and Jobidiah\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg 468w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Moon and Jobidiah\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg 468w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Moon and Jobidiah</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon insists on giving her a lavish funeral, and they bring her body to the mall world of <a href=\"/gimmegimme/4020-59887/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59887\">Gimmegimme</a>, which is run by the odious Unkshuss family. They decide on the <a href=\"/jobidiah/4005-12047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12047\">Jobidiah Unkshuss</a>’s Funeral Palace. Ira, who doesn’t care about Moon or Sunflower, sees a chance to escape with the ship, and secretly manipulates the hired mourners at the funeral, causing a riot. Moon goes nuts at the blasphemy (having already been in a vulnerable state of mind, during which he saw the ghosts of both his mother and Aunt Ettie), and is caught by some of Jobidiah’s other employees.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They bring him to the Jobidiah Unkshuss Home for Miscreants and Madmen, an insane asylum. There he meets a number of menacing aliens, and also someone claiming to be <a href=\"/king-macha/4005-12046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12046\">King Macha</a>, ruler of the interplanetary empire in which they were being held. While there, he saw his father again; like before, he smiled and disappeared with a Poof!</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile Ira realizes that he can’t leave on the Decrepit because Moon had put it in hock to pay for the funeral. Ira breaks Moon out so he can work and pay off the ship’s bill. Moon, not realizing that Ira was responsible for the chaos at the funeral, is overjoyed at seeing Ira. Ira, however, doesn’t care about Moon except as a means to an end, and works Moon to the bone in menial jobs for little money—then spends it on booze and women. Finally the both realize they need to make a big score—but they can only do that through theft. Ira doesn’t care, but Sunflower had made it clear to Moon that theft was unacceptable. Ira beats him into submission, and Moon begins to understand Ira’s lack of reciprocal feelings towards him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They steal a famous egg, but are chased by the police. Ira knocks out Moon in an attempt to avoid being caught, and Moon is faced with Ira’s complete betrayal; he feels entirely bereft. His Aunt Ettie’s ghost appears to him once again, and flies him over the city, offering him the comfort of madness. Moon rejects her offer, however, still feeling the need to Dream. He wanders into a cordon of police, who have already caught Ira, and is captured himself.</p><h3>War</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The two are given the choice between two hundred years in jail, or joining the Machovian army in its war against Goyimia. Moon, still full of Romantic ideas about war, joins happily; Ira, less so. They become part of a squad led by <a href=\"/sgt-chesterbarrel/4005-109194/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109194\">Sergeant Chesterbarrel</a>, along with <a href=\"/rigarollo/4005-109191/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109191\">Rigarollo</a>, <a href=\"/horntoad/4005-109192/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109192\">Horntoad</a>, and others. (Frodo the cat continues to follow, now and throughout their adventures.) Their mission is to go to the planet of <a href=\"/bingbangboom/4020-59889/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59889\">Bingbangboom</a> and find the scientist <a href=\"/lord-gaylord/4005-12042/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12042\">Lord Gaylord</a>, who is said to have made a doomsday weapon that could destroy either empire.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Chesterbarrel, Ira, and Moon eventually find Gaylord, who turns out to be running a peace commune for those against the war. He hasn’t actually created a doomsday weapon, but allows the Machovians and Goyimians to think he has, so they will leave him alone. Chesterbarrel stays, but Moon still believes in the swashbuckling nature of war, and Ira thinks the commune is just another Zoo, so they leave.</p><figure style=\"width: 879px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198845\" data-ratio=\"1.518771331058\" data-width=\"879\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198845\"><img alt=\"Moon sees his father\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg 879w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg 632w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Moon sees his father\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg 879w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg 632w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198845-scan+81.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Moon sees his father</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The squad moves on to the war’s front, on <a href=\"/tsuris/4020-59888/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59888\">Tsuris</a>. There, Moon loses his Romantic ideas very quickly, and comes to adopt his mother’s own antiwar attitude. (Not only is his mother a hippie, but two of her friends and lovers died in the army in the Vietnam era, so she is fervently against war.) The squad is quickly wounded in a bloody battle, and its members separated; Moon is near death. For the third time, Moon’s father appears without saying a word, and leaves.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon sees a vision of his namesake, the poet <a href=\"/moonshadow-the-elder/4005-109195/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109195\">Moonshadow</a>, who was Sunflower’s lover, and killed in Vietnam. He leads Moon through the battlefield until they find Ira. Sunflower’s ghost joins them as well. They keep him company as he walks among the dead. It is unclear whether the ghosts that Moonshadow sees throughout his journey—the elder Moonshadow, Aunt Ettie, and Sunflower—are in fact real ghosts, hallucinations in Moon’s mind, or avatars of the G’L-Doses. In this case, however, Moonshadow the elder seems to transform into Moon’s G’L-Doses father. This time, he acts: he teleports Moon and Ira into the presence of some Goyimian soldiers, who capture them. As with all G.D. actions, it is hard to say whether it is intended to help or hurt: they are captured by their enemies, but on the other hand they are saved from a lingering death from their wounds.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They are brought to a concentration camp, where they are reunited with Rigarollo and Horntoad. Moon swoons into delirium, and his friends have to protect him from the other prisoners. In fact, Ira actually bites the arm off a prisoner who wanted to hurt Moon; this is his first act of friendship towards Moon, and marks a change in attitude towards him. From now on. Ira is still gruff, but more protective and tender as well.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4193378\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193378-scan+91a.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1067961165049\" data-width=\"618\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 618px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193378-scan+91a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193378\"><img alt=\"Moon and his flute\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px\" data-width=\"618\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193378-scan+91a.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193378-scan+91a.jpg 618w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Moon and his flute\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193378-scan+91a.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193378-scan+91a.jpg 618w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px\" data-width=\"618\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Moon and his flute</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon later comes in contact with <a href=\"/darkmeister-ebann/4005-12048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12048\">Darkmeister Ebann</a>, the head of the camp. Ebann somehow sees something in Moonshadow as well, and has him play his flute for him, lightening the burden of his duties in the camp. Soon Moon recruits the rest of his squad to put on plays for Ebann, and it seems like they have some hope after all. However, when Moon asks for clemency for all the prisoners, Ebann seems to realized that he has gone too far, and instead sentences Moon and his friends to death.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When they hang above some boiling vats, ready to be dropped in, Moon sees the elder Moonshadow’s ghost again, who helps him come to peace with himself as he faces death.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ira is dropped into a vat, but the G’L-Doses once again intervene, and magically enhance his fart of fear so that it launches him out of the pot, and destroys the rest of the deadly apparatus. This time, several G.D.s appear. They release all the prisoners, and bind the guards. Darkmeister Ebann dies from the explosion, to Moon’s regret.</p><h3>Palace Intrigues</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ira is made a hero from his role in the escape, and the rest of the squad as well.

They meet the King, who turns out to be the same alien Moon met in the Home for Miscreants and Madmen; apparently he periodically goes insane and is sent away for a while. His wife is <a href=\"/queen-dibbich/4005-12045/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12045\">Queen Dibbich</a>. They both happily take to Ira and Moon, who becomes the nanny to their children.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, they also meet the Unkshuss family, who are the real power behind the throne. In addition to Jobidiah, there is his brother <a href=\"/mobidiah/4005-12039/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12039\">Mobidiah</a>, a thug, his sister <a href=\"/flobidiah/4005-12040/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12040\">Flobidiah</a>, and their father <a href=\"/pobidiah/4005-12041/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12041\">Pobidiah</a>, who rules the economic and religious aspects of the empire. It is they who send Macha away to the asylum.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They take an interest in Ira, and ply him with alcohol and women until they manage to persuade him to go on a tour promoting his heroic role in the war. He leaves (as did Rigarollo and Horntoad before), so once again Moon’s friends are taken from him, although in this case at least he still has the King and Queen’s family, whom he does love very much.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon also starts having to deal with an all-new problem for him—the prurient attentions of the <a href=\"/lady-shady/4005-12043/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12043\">Lady Shady</a>. Shady is a member of the court who has slept with almost everyone else on the court, with a seeming compulsion beyond healthy desires. She turns her attention to Moon, but he avoids it with the nervousness of a randy but Romantically pure-at-heart teen. He has also seen her wandering the grounds many times at night, wailing “why?” in despair, so he wonders if there is something behind her amorousness.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One night Macha wakes Moon up and brings him to his library. Moon is entranced until he realizes that all the books are about Pobidiah, who has banned all other books. However, Macha has hidden two books, <em>The Gospel of Shree Quack-Quack H’onnka</em> and <a href=\"/ragstone-phillit/4005-12051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12051\">Ragstone Phillit</a>’s <em>We Are All Ants in a Meaningless Cosmos</em>, which debate the question of god and meaning in life. They read them and get drunk, reveling in their rebellion, until Moon sees Shady. She takes him back to her room and attempts to seduce him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, Sunflower’s ghost appears, and doesn’t approve, due to Shady’s desperate state of mind. Moon unhappily runs off, to find Pobidiah waiting for him. He has sent Macha back to the asylum. And soon Shady turns back up, with a rape accusation against Moon. Clearly she doesn’t want to say it, but is being blackmailed or controlled by Pobidiah. Moon is forced to leave the castle.</p><h3>On the Run</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon is exiled and on the streets of Gimmgimme, but Pobidiah has told all the businesses of the planet that they can’t serve him, so h can’t get a job or even eat. Luckily he runs into Lord Gaylord, who has just tricked Machovia and Goyimia to end the war. He decided to tell both empires that he would use his fake doomsday weapon against them unless they declared peace, and so they did. This angers Pobidiah, who had started the war, in order to maximize his profits, in the first place.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon and Gaylord celebrate until they come across the body of Lady Shady, who has committed suicide. Clearly she couldn’t live with her role in Moon’s banishment. Moon is once again harrowed by death.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gaylord, however, takes Moon under his wing and brings him back to his home planet of <a href=\"/pillbox/4020-59890/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59890\">Pillbox</a>. It is a beautiful pastoral place, and his friends and family all welcome Moon, including his maid, <a href=\"/mrs-flimflam/4005-109197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109197\">Mrs. Flimflam</a>, and her niece, <a href=\"/bettina/4005-12044/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12044\">Bettina</a>. She is younger than Moon, and helps him get back in touch with his younger self after all his hardship. Moon also loved his long philosophical talks with Gaylord, who was obsessed with the same two books (H’oonka’s and Phillit’s) as Macha. Moon became equally concerned with the question of whether life has meaning or not, as exemplified in the G’L-Doses’ random acts of violence and healing. His Romantic leanings inclined him towards H’onnka, but his doubts were growing, due to his experiences with death, betrayal, and the Unkshusses.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon turns sixteen, and for the first time in a while, is visited by his G.D. father, who shows him a vision of Ira behind bars. Moon feels that he has to rescue his friend, and takes off, leaving a note for his adopted family. He goes to a used-ship lot to get transportation off-world, and miraculously manages to buy back the Decrepit. He and Frodo find that Ira has been traveling the galaxy giving speeches about the war. When Moon sees one, he can’t believe that the anti-war Ira would give such a bellicose talk, full of exaggerations of his role. Again he feels betrayed. Moon confronts him, but Ira seems scared and shrinks back. Moon runs off, confused. He spies on Ira and finds out that Mobidiah Unkshuss has been mind-controlling him through a special helmet, not to mention physically torturing him, drugging his food, and forcing him to live in a cage.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon gets ready to break him out, and is aided by Flobidiah, who seems to pity Ira. It turns out that she is the “black sheep” in her family, in the sense that she is the only one who is not evil. Moon gets Ira out, and Mobidiah beats Flobidiah for her “treachery.\"</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ira is physically and psychically scarred, however, and it takes a long time before Moon is able to get him out of a catatonic state, partly through the use of his flute. As they fly through space, they run into a giant group of G’L-Doses, a clear sign that something important would happen—but what? They G.D.s stick out their tongues and disappear.</p><figure style=\"width: 920px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198928-scan+150.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198928\" data-ratio=\"0.27717391304348\" data-width=\"920\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:27.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198928-scan+150.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198928\"><img alt=\"Moon and Bettina talk about the explosion\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198928-scan+150.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198928-scan+150.jpeg 920w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198928-scan+150.jpeg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Moon and Bettina talk about the explosion\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198928-scan+150.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198928-scan+150.jpeg 920w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198928-scan+150.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Moon and Bettina talk about the explosion</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They return to Pillbox, but to Moon’s horror, Gaylord’s home has been destroyed by an explosion.

This time, Sunflower does not appear, and while Moon has to be literally dragged to the room due to his sexual panic, he happily completes the act once he is there.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ira, however, was there to salve his psychic wounds, much as the Lady Shady had tried to solve her own problems through sex before, and is in his room for more than a week, causing havoc among the employees. Finally he emerges, somewhat healed, but also clearly still having difficulties with his sense of self.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon and Ira are arrested by Pobidiah’s men at I.H.O.T. and brought to his dungeons. On the way, Ira tells Moon several contradictory stories about his early life, each completely different, but all filled with pain and desire. Moon believes all of them and none of them.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They are chained up, and Pobidiah, acting as grand inquisitor of his own religion, demands they admit their sins against him. They refuse; Moon laughs with a pure cynicism that he has only recently grown into. However, when Pobidiah threatens Ira, Moon still begs for his friend’s safety, and Pobidiah knows that Moon is still the same pure boy that he can’t accept underneath.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He leaves them alone, and Moon starts having visitations from the dead: his mother, Mad Aunt Ettie, and his namesake, the elder Moonshadow.

They camp in a cave, and Ira gets more and more sick. One day, someone gives Ira some fruit…it is perhaps H’onnka himself, but the others miss him. Then Ira dies. Moon’s pain is intense, and he throws away his mother’s flute. Then Flobidiah leaves as well, going off in search of H’onnka.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moon sees his mother again, and she leads him into a mystic experience. There is a bright light. He walks over a tightrope, as he feels he has done since birth, and soars through the cosmos, landing with a crash back in the cave, with the flute in his lap. He sees a misty cave, and flashes of everyone and everything important in his life. There is a classic G’L-Doses Pop! Poof! Ping! Finally he emerges, piping William Blake’s “Song of Innocence” on his flute, having made peace with himself, and completed his Journey to Awakening.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Middle Age</b></p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4193400\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193400-scan+182.jpeg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.58125\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193400-scan+182.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193400\"><img alt=\"Moon in middle age\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193400-scan+182.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193400-scan+182.jpeg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193400-scan+182.jpeg 607w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Moon in middle age\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193400-scan+182.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193400-scan+182.jpeg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193400-scan+182.jpeg 607w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Moon in middle age</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Several years later, Moon is once again in an existential period of life.

Numerous books and other works of art have been made about him. He narrates his own early life, as seen and described in the original series. In the series, he is often shown with various women and children, especially at the end, where he is making a painting of several children. Originally it seems that these are his own children, but based on the end of <em>Farewell Moonshadow</em>, presumably they are from the many families that he cares for on Pillbox.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4193402\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5604883462819\" data-width=\"901\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 901px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193402\"><img alt=\"Moon's apotheosis\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg 901w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg 615w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Moon's apotheosis\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg 901w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg 615w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Moon's apotheosis</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At a birthday party when he is very old, he is still surrounded by many people of all ages. He is in a wheelchair, and Frodo (who has lived far longer than a cat’s normal lifespan) still sits on his lap. An unknown woman (perhaps Bettina?) comes up and kisses him, and gives him a snowglobe with a happy family inside.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He blows out the candle on his cake and dies. Then he slowly turns into a G’L-Doses and rises into the air, Frodo balancing on his head. They merge into the moon.</p><h2>Textual Ambiguities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Towards the end of the original <i>Moonshadow</i> series, in <i>Farewell</i> <i>Moonshadow</i>, and in the interview with JM Dematteis and Jon J Muth in the final Vertigo reprint of the original series, it becomes clear that the older Moonshadow’s narration of his younger life may not be accurate. He may be an unreliable narrator.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Some of the recaps in the original series imply that he isn’t always telling the truth, for instance in issue 8, a character who has been listening to the elder Moon says “I have come to see, at long last…how <i>true</i> his lies were.” In <em>Farewell Moonshadow</em>, the elder Moon at his party is surrounded by objects that are related to his story, but seem different in key characteristics, such as a classic wood ship in a bottle with the title The Decrepit. When the woman comes up to kiss him, it seems that perhaps she might be Bettina, in which case she wasn’t killed (although it is also possible she is someone else).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the interview, the creators are more explicit. Muth says, “I really like what Marc [Dematteis] had said at one point: that maybe all of this stuff was made up, or in fact, <i>all</i> of this stuff about Moonshadow <i>is</i> made up.” Dematteis continues, “Yeah, my feeling was, and I didn’t discover this until issue #10, that he was <i>lying</i>! I really truly didn’t know, and then one day I realized he’s making this all up. He’s taking the essence of his life and he’s turning it into a fairlytale. So we really don’t know what the real details of Moonshadow’s life were—we just know what he <i>told</i> us in the original story.”</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">So in essence, all of the above description of Moonshadow’s life is not what actually happened, but it is the way he described his life to others.</p><h2>Fictional Books about Moonshadow</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>The Memoirs of Moonshadow</em> (Intergalactic Digest Condensed Version and Intergalactic Digest New, Improved, Super-Condensed Version), by Moonshadow</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><em>Moonshadow: A Life?</em> (Intergalactic Digest Version), by E.

He usually appears as <a href=\"/moonshadow/4005-12035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12035\">Moonshadow</a>'s silent companion and emotional support.  He could be seen as something as a totem item for Moon, a symbol of security, family, and mystery, along with Moon's flute.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Moonshadow</h3><p>Frodo begins life as a feces-covered cat belonging to a hippie commune.  One night, <a href=\"/sunflower/4005-109182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109182\">Sunflower</a> is holding him when they are both abducted by the alien <a href=\"/gl-doses/4060-61181/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61181\">G'L-Doses</a> and transported to <a href=\"/the-zoo/4020-59886/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59886\">the Zoo</a>, a benign location in space where creatures from across the universe have been brought to fulfill the whim of the G'L-Doses.</p><p>Sunflower and Frodo live together alone until the birth of Moonshadow (his father is a G'L-Doses).  Frodo becomes Moon's constant companion from then on.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193376-scan+79.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193376\" data-ratio=\"0.91402714932127\" data-width=\"884\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 884px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193376-scan+79.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193376\"><img alt=\"Frodo and Moon\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193376-scan+79.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193376-scan+79.jpeg 884w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193376-scan+79.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Frodo and Moon</figcaption></figure><p>When the G'L-Doses eventually let Moon leave the Zoo, they send Frodo, Sunflower, and another friend, <a href=\"/ira/4005-12034/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12034\">Ira</a>, along with him.  They travel through space and have many adventures.  Frodo stays close, walking along behind Moon or even riding inside his space helmet.  He follows Moonshadow into the insane asylum, his attempt to rob the Godsegg, and jail.  When Moon went to war, Frodo is absent, but suddenly appears (possibly through the invervention of the G'L-Doses) when Moon finds Ira and is captured.</p><p>In the prisoner-of-war camp, Frodo breaks away to hunt, and when Moon goes off to look for him, he runs into <a href=\"/darkmeister-ebann/4005-12048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12048\">Darkmeister Ebann</a>, the head of the camp.  Ebann takes a shine to Moon and helps him for a while.  However he eventually sentences Moon and his friends, including Frodo, to death.  They are saved by the G'L-Doses and becomes heroes of the realm.  They live with the king and queen and nanny their children before being forced out.</p><p>They find a happy life on <a href=\"/pillbox/4020-59890/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59890\">Pillbox</a> before searching for and finding the missing Ira.

They leave together, dancing to a William Blake tune piped on Moon's flute.</p><h3>Farewell Moonshadow</h3><p>As seen throughout the flashforward scenes in Moonshadow, Frodo remains with Moon in his old age.  This continues in <a href=\"/farewell-moonshadow-1-farewell-moonshadow/4000-150867/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-150867\"><em>Farewell Moonshadow</em></a>.</p><p>Moon, now a young adult, and Frodo, now much better cared-for than he was long ago on the commune, go back to Pillbox.

In one of the few moments of true characterization for Frodo, he is described as mewing at the moon with \"insufferable longing\" at night, just as Moonshadow himself feels.</p><p>A storm comes and kills Moon's new family.  Only Frodo remains, with a broken leg.  Moon considers killing him out of despair but instead hugs him, once again his only companion.  Eventually Moon finds peace as a provider for the poor and bereft in his area.  A mythology springs up about his life, and he becomes famous across the universe.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193402\" data-ratio=\"1.5604883462819\" data-width=\"901\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 901px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193402\"><img alt=\"Moon's transubstantiation\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg 901w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg 615w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4193402-scan+188.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Moon's transubstantiation</figcaption></figure><p>Many years later, Moon is a very old man in a wheelchair. Frodo remains on his lap as they celebrate Moon's birthday. He recalls his life as a young adult, then dies.  He is then resurrected as a G'L-Doses himself (like his father).  Frodo, still his truest companion, floats on top of him as they soar off together into the heavens, where they merge with the moon.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>All members of the Zoo are given immortal lifespans when they are in the Zoo.  This seems to wear off for the others when they leave the Zoo (for instance Moonshadow eventually dies of old age), but Frodo seems to retain his immortality, living until Moon is an old man, far beyond a cat's normal lifespan.</p>",

The family patriarch is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pobidiah/4005-12041/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12041\">Pobidiah</a>, who is a religous leader akin to the pope, as well as the builder of the Machovian home planet of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gimmegimme/4020-59887/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59887\">Gimmegimme</a>.

Jobidiah is an oligarch and owns most of the businesses on Gimmegimme. Mobidiah is the thug-like enforcer who does the dirty work. Flobidiah, however, is the \"black sheep\" of the family, in the sense that she is kind hearted.  In fact, she once even wishes that she had been aborted rather than live with her family. She traces her kindness back to her mother, who was a good person. Still, she usually does what Mobidiah says.</p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonshadow/4005-12035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12035\">Moonshadow</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ira/4005-12034/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12034\">Ira</a>, and their friends become war heroes, they visit the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king-macha/4005-12046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12046\">king's</a> palace. The Unkshusses, who also live at the palace, try to brainwash Ira and get him to go on tour giving a series of victory speeches around the universe, partly to make money and partly for propaganda for the war, which the Unkshusses started.</p><p>They finally get Ira to come with them through a combination of giving him the sex and alcohol that he craves, and partly through a mind-control helmet, since although Ira is a completely dissolute soul, he does bitterly hate and fear war.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198902-scan+140.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198902\" style=\"width: 402px\" data-ratio=\"0.95273631840796\" data-width=\"402\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198902-scan+140.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198902\"><img alt=\"Flobidiah comforts Ira\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198902-scan+140.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198902-scan+140.jpeg 402w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198902-scan+140.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Flobidiah comforts Ira</figcaption></figure><p>Moonshadow finally finds Ira and confronts him on stage. When he realizes that he is being controlled, Moon runs off in shock. He comes back and finds him in a cage, where Mobidiah has been physically and mentally torturing him.  Flobidiah, however, secretly loves the gross-but-cuddly Ira, and has been trying to give him some comfort throughout the tour, even though Ira is too out of it to realize what is going on.  When she realizes that Moon is there to rescue Ira, she leaves the key in the door and lets Ira escape, even though she knows it will get her in trouble with her brother.  When Mobidiah realizes Flobidiah's treason, and even though he professes to love his sister, he beats her badly with his cane.</p><p>Later, Moon and Ira are caught and put in Pobidiah's dungeon.  Moon shoots Pobidiah, but is confronted by Mobidiah and some guards.  Flobidiah once again comes to the rescue, and lets Moon and Ira out through a secret door. Mobidiah pursues them, but is stopped by the arrival of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/queen-dibbich/4005-12045/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12045\">Queen Dibbich</a>, who finally decides to stand up to the Unkshusses. The other Unkshusses are dealt with by the queen, but Flobidiah now joins Ira and Moon on their next journey.</p><p>They try to find Shree Quack-Quack H'onnka, a famous mystic who supposedly knows the true meaning of life.  They go to the <a href=\"/world-of-mists/4020-59891/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59891\">World of Mists</a>, where he is rumored to live, but can find only pilgrims who have been wandering about for years trying to find him.  Ira becomes sick from all his travails, and Ira and Moon care for him and discuss philosophy and life and family.  Ira dies, and Flobidiah leaves to join the pilgrims.  She believes that she will eventually find H'onnka and find peace.</p>",

He and Ira end up at the palace.  It soon becomes clear that Pobidiah is the real power behind the throne.  Since he owns all of Gimmegimme, the true king, <a href=\"/king-macha/4005-12046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12046\">King Macha</a>, is forced to (literally) kiss up to him and do what he says.  Pobidiah has a variety of religious titles to back up his power, such as Pious Rabbi, although he is not actually Jewish (or religious at all).  Half of Machovia is said to be on his payroll.  He goes so far as to ban all books except his own, <em>The Collected Wisdom of Pobidiah Unkshuss</em>., which is just pictures of himself.</p><p>Moon realizes that Pobidiah is behind many of the plans that he has run into.  Pobidiah instigated the current long-standing war between Machovia and another empire, Goyimia, from which he profits.  He occasionally sends the king into a lunatic asylum to keep a better hold on power.  And he gets Mobidiah to brainwash Ira to go on tour promoting the war.</p><p>Pobidiah soon realizes that Moon will be a thorn in his control of the kingdom.  He manipulates events to get Moon charged with raping the <a href=\"/lady-shady/4005-12043/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12043\">Lady Shady</a>, whom Pobidiah is apparently blackmailing, and who lies in support of the false charges.  Pobidiah has all of Moon's own books burned and banishes him.

However, for now Moon and Gaylord go off to another planet and live peacefully.  Unfortunately the Lady Shady kills herself, presumably out of guilt over what she did to Moon.</p><p>When Moon leaves to save Ira, Pobidiah has Gaylord's home destroyed, apparently killing him and his lover.  Moon is stunned.  He is eventually captured by Pobidiah's minions and he and Ira are put in his dungeon.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198904-scan+161.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198904\" style=\"width: 934px\" data-ratio=\"0.7762312633833\" data-width=\"934\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198904-scan+161.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198904\"><img alt=\"Pobidiah tortures Moon and Ira\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198904-scan+161.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198904-scan+161.jpeg 934w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198904-scan+161.jpeg 480w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198904-scan+161.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Pobidiah tortures Moon and Ira</figcaption></figure><p>He says (insincerely) he has just truly converted to religion and needs to purge Moon and Ira's hearts.

    "description": "<h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Lord Gaylord, a native of the planet <a href=\"/pillbox/4020-59890/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59890\">Pillbox</a>, and member of the Goyimian empire, tires of the long war between the Goyimians and the Machovians. The Goyimians told him to go to <a href=\"/bingbangboom/4020-59889/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59889\">Bingbangboom</a> to build a doomsday weapon. However, he decided not to build it, and simply told them that he had, and that it was powerful enough to destroy both empires at once. This made both empires fearful. They sent people to stop him, but once they met him they also feel in love with his dream of peace and lived with him in a sort of secret peace commune.</p><p><a href=\"/moonshadow/4005-12035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12035\">Moonshadow</a>'s army squad was sent on one of these missions. His leader, <a href=\"/sgt-chesterbarrel/4005-109194/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109194\">Sgt. Chesterbarrel</a>, was convinced to stay with Gaylord, but Moon was still full of the romance of war, and his friend <a href=\"/ira/4005-12034/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12034\">Ira</a> thought Gaylord's castle was sort of like another <a href=\"/the-zoo/4020-59886/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59886\">Zoo</a>, a place of captivity even if it was dedicated to peace, so they left.</p><p>Gaylord next meets Moon on the mall planet of <a href=\"/gimmegimme/4020-59887/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59887\">Gimmegimme</a>. Gaylord felt that Ira's critique was true, and that he was not doing enough for peace. So he threatened both empires that he would use the (nonexistent) bomb unless they declared peace. They did so, and Gaylord went to Gimmegimme to see the celebration. Moon is in bad shape, so Gaylord takes him home to Pillbox, where he lives in the beautiful rural town of Poof.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198924-scan+127.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198924\" data-ratio=\"0.57782515991471\" data-width=\"938\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 938px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198924-scan+127.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198924\"><img alt=\"Gaylord and Dimhoffer\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198924-scan+127.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198924-scan+127.jpeg 938w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198924-scan+127.jpeg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198924-scan+127.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Gaylord and Dimhoffer</figcaption></figure><p>There Gaylord returns to his favored life as an inventor, making all sorts of crazy things in his studio.

He often enjoys arguing and teaching philosophy with Moon, particularly the teachings of <a href=\"/ragstone-phillit/4005-12051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12051\">Ragstone Phillit</a> (who does not believe there is any meaning to life) and Shree Quack-Quack H'onnka (who does, and with whom Gaylord agrees). He tries to invent a Supernal Compass to discover proof of God.</p><p>Moon eventually leaves to find his friend Ira, who was kidnapped. While he is gone, Gaylord's lab explodes. <a href=\"/pobidiah/4005-12041/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12041\">Pobidiah Unkshuss</a>, who wanted the war with Goyimia to continue, sabotaged it. However, he made it look like Gaylord's Supernal Compass experiments blew up. Bettina and Mrs. Flimflam are out, and survive, but Mr. Dimhoffer is killed, and it seems as if Gaylord is killed as well. When Moon finally returns, he is shocked and cannot deal with their deaths. He leaves without going to the funeral.</p><p>However, some time later, Moon receives a letter from Gaylord, saying that he survived the explosion and has found the mysterious Shree Quack-Quack H'onnka on the <a href=\"/world-of-mists/4020-59891/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59891\">World of Mists</a>. He asks Moon to join him. Moon isn't sure if the letter is real, but goes to the World of Mists. He never finds Gaylord, but he does have a mystical Awakening similar to what Gaylord was searching for all this time.</p><p>At the end, it is unclear whether the letter from Gaylord is real, and if he is truly alive.  Moonshadow wonders if the letter was actually created by the <a href=\"/gl-doses/4060-61181/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61181\">G'L-Doses</a>, a powerful race of aliens that act on whim.</p>",

    "description": "<p> The Lady Shady is the wife of Lord Bord, a member of the bureaucracy of Machovia.  She is known as a beautiful and highly sexual woman.  Despite being old enough to be his mother, she attempts to seduce <a href=\"/moonshadow/4005-12035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12035\">Moonshadow</a> quite openly, but (being still a virgin and full of sexual panic) he ignores her for the purer joy of nannying <a href=\"/queen-dibbich/4005-12045/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12045\">Queen Dibbich</a>'s children.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194205-scan+107.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4194205\" data-ratio=\"0.9154616240267\" data-width=\"899\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 899px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194205-scan+107.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4194205\"><img alt=\"The Lady Shady's private question to the world\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4194205-scan+107.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194205-scan+107.jpeg 899w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4194205-scan+107.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Lady Shady's private question to the world</figcaption></figure><p>Moon spies on her, and sees that she regularly walks in the palace gardens, clutching herself and crying out \"Why?\" to the world, day after day.  Moon becomes convinced that her sexual drive covers up some other existential need, but never learns what it is.</p><p>One night, after <a href=\"/king-macha/4005-12046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12046\">King Macha</a> shows Moon his hidden library of books, which he has hidden from <a href=\"/pobidiah/4005-12041/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12041\">Pobidiah Unkshuss</a>, the cruel, manipulative religious leader of the world, and the two of them get drunk, the Lady Shady shows up and brings Moon back to her room.</p><p>Despite Moon's understanding that the Lady Shady's lust is really a sad sexual disorder, they get into bed together and Moon prepares to finally lose his virginity.  But then he suddenly has a vision or spiritual visitation from his <a href=\"/sunflower/4005-109182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109182\">mother</a>, who persuades him that this union is wrong, due to Shady's emotional state.</p><p>Moon runs back to Macha, and discovers that Pobidiah has destroyed the books.  Right after, Shady shows up and accuses Moon of raping her.  Clearly, she has been blackmailed somehow by Pobidiah.  It is unclear whether her earlier attempted seductions (in previous weeks) were of her own initiative or not.  It is also unknown whether her daily tormented walks were the result of Pobidiah's manipulation, or whether they derived from the same source that he used to blackmail her.  Moon is forced to leave <a href=\"/gimmegimme/4020-59887/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59887\">Gimmegimme</a> in order to avoid the charges.</p><p>Much later, Moon returns to Gimmegimme just in time to find the fresh corpse of Lady Shady laying in the street.  She had ridden her carriage up to Unkshuss's hotel and screamed at him, then shot herself in the head. She had seemingly had enough with Pobidiah's manipulation of her life and that of others.</p><p>Thereafter, the Lady Shady always held a special place in Moon's mind, as a tragic and beautiful figure, one always intertwined with his memories of love and lust.</p>",

She is the niece of <a href=\"/mrs-flimflam/4005-109197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109197\">Marigold Flimflam</a>, and they live with <a href=\"/mr-dimhoffer/4005-109196/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109196\">Mr. Dimhoffer</a> and <a href=\"/lord-gaylord/4005-12042/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12042\">Lord Gaylord</a>. Her parents were killed when she was very young.  Gaylord brings <a href=\"/moonshadow/4005-12035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12035\">Moonshadow</a> home with him one day, and Moon stays there for some time.

However, he makes it look like one of Gaylord's inventions malfunctioned. Luckily Bettina and Mrs. Flimflam are out at the time.  However they are in shock and go to live at their neighbor's house.</p><p>Moon returns, and can't believe what happened.  He leaves without staying for the funeral, breaking Bettina's heart and his own.</p><h3>Farewell Moonshadow</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198929-scan+186.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198929\" data-ratio=\"1.577685088634\" data-width=\"959\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 959px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198929-scan+186.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4198929\"><img alt=\"Bettina and Moonshadow in love\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198929-scan+186.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4198929-scan+186.jpeg 959w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4198929-scan+186.jpeg 608w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4198929-scan+186.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Bettina and Moonshadow in love</figcaption></figure><p>Many years later, when Moon is a young adult, he returns to Pillbox to live.  He works as a tinker, but doesn't tell anyone his real name, and doesn't contact Bettina, although he secretly follows her around.  Finally Aunt Marigold forces Moonshadow to admit who he is and makes him talk to Bettina, who has also realized who he is and has been pining away for him all this time.  They marry soon after and have several children: Mia, Charles, Charlotte, and Katherine.  They live a wonderful life for a short time, with their children putting on plays for their amusement.  Moonshadow has been questing after love for his entire Romantic life, and has finally found it.</p><p>Aunt Marigold dies of old age.  Moon refuses to go to her funeral also.  Soon after a freak storm hits the area and kills the entire family, leaving only Moonshadow alive.  He dives into a deep depression for years afterwards, and never forgets her.</p><p>However, when Moon is very old and about to die of old age, he has a birthday party. While at this party, he has flashbacks to the story above. Then, an old woman comes up and kisses him at the party and gives him a snow globe with a house and family inside.  This woman could be Bettina (or possibly the <a href=\"/lady-shady/4005-12043/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12043\">Lady Shady</a>, his other long-lost love). How could this be? <em>Moonshadow</em>'s writer, <a href=\"/jm-dematteis/4040-41043/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41043\">J.M. Dematteis</a>, has said that Moonshadow is an unreliable narrator within the series, and that that Moon may have made up much of the story about his life.  It is therefore possible that the flashback, in which Bettina (or Shady) dies is not true, and the old woman at the party is the true Bettina. Or, the party story could also be made up, or the woman could be someone other than Bettina.</p>",

Macha is often sent away to an insane asylum, partly due to the machinations of the Unkshuss family, who manipulate him and the empire to gain the real control over the empire, but also because he is actually fairly loony.  Both she and he are scared of the Unkshusses.</p><p>When it comes to ruling, Dibbich usually takes a backseat to Macha, but she runs the castle and their kids, and sincerely loves her husband.  She is, however, enormously fat and often self-obsessed.  Paradoxically, she was a peasant in her childhood, and she still has sympathy for the poor, who are trodden upon by the Unkshuss's machinations.</p><p>After <a href=\"/moonshadow/4005-12035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12035\">Moonshadow</a> and his friends arrive at the palace, heralded as heroes, they are asked to live there.

However, Moon is kicked out of the palace by <a href=\"/pobidiah/4005-12041/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12041\">Pobidiah</a> Unkshuss. In the meantime, Pobidiah continues to take over, and puts Dibbich on drugs to pacify her.</p><p>Much later, Moon is captured and put in Pobidiah's dungeon.  One of her kids sees Moon and tells the Queen, who shows up and has <a href=\"/mobidiah/4005-12039/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12039\">Mobidiah</a> (another Unkshuss) arrested.  She stands up for herself and takes over the kingdom while Macha is once again in the asylum.

There, Moon finds out that Macha is in fact the king, and he becomes the nanny for the king's children.  Despite his lengthier relationship with the king, Moon becomes better friends with Dibbich than Macha, probably because of Macha's insanity.  He swings back and forth from kindness to whacking Moon with a sausage.</p><p>Macha is aware of how the Unkshusses are manipulating him, but can do nothing about it, and debases himself in front of them regularly.  He does attempt to have them killed at one point, but fails.</p><p>In the midst of one of his mood swings, tempered by his fear and hatred of Podibiah, Macha asks Moon to join him in the library.  There he pulls two secret books out of the toilet (because Pobidiah has outlawed all other books).  These books, <a href=\"/ragstone-phillit/4005-12051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12051\">Ragstone Phillit</a>'s <em>We Are All Ants in a Meaningless Cosmos</em>, and <em>The Gospel of Shree Quack-Quack H'onnka,</em> become the two most influential books on Moon's philosophy of life.

Moon is accused of rape and forced to leave the palace, Macha is once again accused of insanity and sent away, and the queen is confined to quarters.  The Unkshusses have almost complete control.</p><p>Much later, Moon is captured and brought to the Unkshuss's dungeon, but he escapes and Queen Dibbich is finally able to take control of the kingdom out of the Unkshuss's hands. She says that Macha will arrive home soon after to help her rule, but Moon leaves before he sees him.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>The Unkshuss family are malicious humanoid aliens that sort of resemble Dr. Seuss characters, and control the Machovian empire from behind the scenes. The family patriarch is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pobidiah/4005-12041/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12041\">Pobidiah</a>, who is a religious leader akin to the pope, as well as the builder of the Machovian home planet of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gimmegimme/4020-59887/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59887\">Gimmegimme</a>. His children are Jobidiah, <a href=\"/mobidiah/4005-12039/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12039\">Mobidiah</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flobidiah/4005-12040/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12040\">Flobidiah</a>. The top-hat-wearing Jobidiah is an oligarch and owns most of the businesses on Gimmegimme. Mobidiah is the thug-like enforcer who does the dirty work. Flobidiah is the \"black sheep\" of the family, in the sense that she is kind hearted, but she usually does what Mobidiah says.</p><p>Although Pobidiah is the creator of Gimmegimme, Jobidiah seems to run most of its businesses, most of them eponymous. Throughout the series, he is shown to own the Jobidiah Unkshuss Funeral Palace, the Jobidiah Unkshuss Home for Miscreants and Madmen, the Jobidiah Unkshuss Society for Lint and Bottlecap Collectors, the Jobidiah Unkshuss Home for Oddities and Antiquities, and so on.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4194254\" style=\"width: 468px\" data-ratio=\"0.97222222222222\" data-width=\"468\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4194254\"><img alt=\"In his first appearances, he was quite a bit bigger than Moonshadow, but later on he and his family are human-sized.\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg 468w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/4194254-scan+53.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>In his first appearances, he was quite a bit bigger than Moonshadow, but later on he and his family are human-sized.</figcaption></figure><p>Jobidiah first meets <a href=\"/moonshadow/4005-12035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12035\">Moonshadow</a> when he comes to Gimmegimme to have his mother's funeral. Moon unfortunately goes to Jobidiah's Funeral Palace and Jobidiah, perhaps the most unctuous of the Unkshuss family, persuades him to spend all his money on the funeral. When <a href=\"/ira/4005-12034/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12034\">Ira</a> causes problems, the funeral becomes mayhem, and Moon goes nuts in despair, Jobidiah has Moon sent to his insane asylum, which also houses the king of Machovia, <a href=\"/king-macha/4005-12046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12046\">King Macha</a>.</p><p>Moon has several more adventures and ends up being a war hero. He and Ira end up at the palace, where they meet King Macha again. It seems that the Unkshusses send him to the asylum occasionally to keep their hold on power. Jobidiah and the others manipulate Ira to work for them giving speeches about the war.</p><p>They then trump up some charges against Moon and force him to leave. From this point on Jobidiah acts as his father's servile right hand man, helping to stick the king, queen, and their children away in the asylum or in detention, and generally speaking oil the wheels of his father's plans.</p><p>Much later, Moon and Ira are captured and put in Pobidiah's dungeons, where Jobidiah gloats over them. However Ira breaks their chains and Moon shoots (but doesn't kill) Pobidiah. This event forces even the malevolent yes-man Jobidiah to break down and cry over his father's wounded body, filled with real emotion for the first time.</p><p>Soon after <a href=\"/queen-dibbich/4005-12045/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12045\">Queen Dibbich</a> manages to take back control of the kingdom, and captures and presumably jails Jobidiah.</p>",

However, once day Moon runs into him by accident while chasing his cat, Frodo.  Instead of killing them, Ebann instead takes them into his protection.  He misses his life and family from before the war, and has Moonshadow act as a bit of a court jester for him, playing songs to remind him of his old life.</p><p>Ebann is not a pure man of peace; he is responsible for the terrible conditions in the camp.  But Moon is able to return some of his \"humanity,\" even starting a theater troupe with Ira, Horntoad, and Rigarollo that played privately for Ebann.</p><p>However, when Moon tries to get Darkmeister Ebann to give their relative freedom to all the prisoners, Ebann reacts badly, unable to grow quite so quickly or so far.  He orders them to be executed, although he seems conflicted in doing so.</p><p>As they are being lowered into tanks of noxious fluid, the G'L-Doses intervene, and Ira explosively farts his way out of his tank.  The fluid floods the camp, and fires break out. The Goyimians run off an leave the camp open. Meanwhile Ebann secretly closes the tanks underneath the Moon and the others, and they escape.  Moonshadow finds Ebann, dying, and thanks him for the rescue.  Ebann's last words are, \"I don't understand.\"  It is unclear whether he is responding to Moonshadow's thanks, or more likely to his role in the world of war and peace, as a conflicted figure that is both, as Moonshadow call him, a murderer and a savior.</p>",

    "description": "<h2> Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Martin Bernbaum is a Jew who lives in Brooklyn and is married to Esther.  He works as a trash collector.  In his early manhood he tries to enlist in World War II, but is rejected for physical reasons.  He takes this as a personal insult for a long time afterwards.</p><p>In 1946, he and Esther have a daughter, <a href=\"/sunflower/4005-109182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-109182\">Sheila Fay</a>.  Her blue eyes remind him of his insane dead sister, \"<a href=\"/esther-bernbaum/4005-12050/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12050\">Mad Aunt Ettie</a>.\"  Sheila does in fact grow up to be just the same kind of rebellious, artistic, internalized child that Ettie was.  In her twenties she becomes a hippie and drops out of society, taking the name Sunflower.  She is eventually kidnapped by the aliens known as the <a href=\"/gl-doses/4060-61181/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61181\">G'L-Doses</a>, who being her to <a href=\"/the-zoo/4020-59886/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59886\">the Zoo</a>.  One of them marries her and they have a son, Martin's grandson, <a href=\"/moonshadow/4005-12035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12035\">Moonshadow</a>.</p><p>While she is still a child, however, she had a close relationship with her father.  Once, when she is nine, a girl friend shows Sheila a stag film; when Martin finds out he goes over and yells at the other girl's dad protectively.  They would often take walks, eat Jewish delicacies, and talk about philosophy.  Seeing himself as a realist, a sample piece of philosophy he would share with his young daughter might include, \"You're born, you die, and that's it.  There's no Heaven or Hell--just a tombstone with your name on it.  You're in the ground--and you're NOTHING.\"  (It is perhaps not surprising that she went forth in life to find what meaning she could in drugs and free love.)  They also often happily watched TV together as a family.  </p><p>Although Martin was usually the sane one in the family, even he had a yearly bout of insanity that would scare his family and neighbors with its intensity.</p><p>Since Moonshadow is born after Sunflower is abducted, he never meets Martin, but hears many stories of him from his mother.  Moon long feels the absence of a father and often searches for a father figure in his life; the stories of Martin Berbaum often fill in for this position.</p><p> </p>",

There is a streak of madness in the family and it is believed that anyone with those eyes has the madness.</p><p>Ettie, also known as Mad Aunt Ettie by Moonshadow, certainly fulfills the family prophecy.  Often playing a flute like the pipes of Pan on a trail of divine madness, she leaves her husband and three children (having already put them through a discomfiting home life) to join a French traveling theater group.  Her husband divorces her.  Within two years she ends up living alone in a pile of rubbish and shortly dies in an insane asylum in Paris.  She is found with her flute in her mouth.</p><p>Her brother and family all see her life as a cautionary tale to avoid the trap of Romanticism and hedonism.</p><h3>As a Spirit</h3><p>Ettie often appears in the young Sunflower's dreams as a kind of banshee, screaming for the return of her eyes, and Moon sometimes sees her as well.  It is unknown whether Ettie is actually a ghost, or just a vision or hallucination in the minds of her beholders.  Ettie's insanity became an extra warning to both Sunflower and Moon to watch out for their melodramatic leanings.  Unlike Sunflower and Moon, however, who were merely Romantics who tended to give in to their passions, Aunt Ettie was actually full-on bonkers.</p><p>Both Sunflower and Moonshadow inherit her flute in turn, seeing it as almost magical, and use it as an outlet for their meandering minds and feelings.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193832-scan+64.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193832\" style=\"width: 885px\" data-ratio=\"0.81242937853107\" data-width=\"885\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193832-scan+64.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4193832\"><img alt=\"Taking a hallucinatory trip with Moonshadow\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193832-scan+64.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4193832-scan+64.jpeg 885w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/4193832-scan+64.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Taking a hallucinatory trip with Moonshadow</figcaption></figure><p>She first appears to Moon when he is bereft of friends and on the run.

He basically believes that life is meaningless.  His philosophical opposite is Shree Quack-Quack H'onnka, who believes that everything in life is meaningful.</p><p> Phillit's most famous book is <em>We Are All Ants in a Meaningless Cosmos</em>.  In it he delves into the possible meaning and motivations of the <a href=\"/gl-doses/4060-61181/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61181\">G'L-Doses</a>, a powerful and inscrutable race.  He believes that their only motivation is whim, and that they are proof of the randomness of the universe.  This belief becomes the accepted view on the G'L-Doses.</p><p>His book was a hit, and he had trillions of acolytes.</p><p>Unfortunately for Phillit, the G'L-Doses abducted him and sent him to the <a href=\"/the-zoo/4020-59886/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59886\">Zoo</a> soon after, and he was never heard from again.</p><p>Curiously, considering that denizens of the Zoo have immortal lifespans, and that Moonshadow is a huge reader, Moon never has any interaction with Phillit while he is living in the Zoo himself.  He seems to have first heard of Phillit from <a href=\"/king-macha/4005-12046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12046\">King Macha</a>; after that Phillit and H'onnka are Moon's major philosophical influences.</p>",

One of her assignments was to attack <a href=\"../../emma-frost/29-1457/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Emma Frost</a>, placing her in an illusion after the Sisterhood invaded the X-Mansion; Emma seemingly freed herself of the psychic illusion and brutally beat Regan leaving her bruised and knocked out.

Although similar in nature to the abilities her father had, Regan's illusions seem much more powerful since they do not dissipate after she has lost consciousness. Also, unlike their father, Regan and her sister possesses limited telepathic abilities, which they use to make their illusions all the more accurate.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Regan's illusions are hypnotic based and her victims tend to accept them as fact, even if the images and scenarios that are created involve sudden changes to the world around, are inconsistent and/or improbable. An example would be when Rogue, under Lady Mastermind's control, did not question the sudden existence of a multitude of <a href=\"/vargas/4005-4643/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4643\"> Vargas</a>'s, or the random jumps in location and time she was experiencing. As a result, Regan's illusions can be used as a very effective brainwashing tool.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Regan's illusion powers are also capable of killing, as her victims' bodies will respond as if her illusions are real. When Regan confronted Viceroy with the illusion that he was drowning, and believing it to be real, he suffocated, despite having no physical injuries and being in a room with sufficient oxygen. Lifeguard's body also responded in a similar way, bleeding through the pores in her back when she was under the illusion she had been stabbed. Her illusions are also capable of putting her enemies into a permanent coma like state if she telepathically places her victims mind in a maze from which there's no escape, thus effectively trapping her victims mind in a psychic prison. It was recently shown that her ability to create elaborate illusions, could affect a telepath as strong as Emma Frost . By using her ability to emit a psychic chaff in the mind of Emma, she was able to confuse the telepath by interrupting Emma's cognition allowing her not to understand what the situation was, also preventing her from fighting back with her psionic powers.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">She also carries two handguns in the belt of her X-Men uniform.</p><h2>Status</h2><figure style=\"width: 348px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9490/391127-11684-lady-mastermind.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391127\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.7212643678161\" data-width=\"348\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:172.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9490/391127-11684-lady-mastermind.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391127\"><img alt=\"Regan Wyngarde\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px\" data-width=\"371\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9490/391127-11684-lady-mastermind.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9490/391127-11684-lady-mastermind.jpg 348w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Regan Wyngarde\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9490/391127-11684-lady-mastermind.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9490/391127-11684-lady-mastermind.jpg 348w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px\" data-width=\"371\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Regan Wyngarde</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Known Relatives</b>: Jason Wyngarde aka Mastermind (father, deceased), Martinique Jason (half-sister).</li></ul><ul><li><b>Citizenship</b><b>:</b> U.S. with a criminal record</li></ul><ul><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Single</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Adventurer, former terrorist, Mercenary employed by Sebastian Shaw.</li><li><b>Education:</b> Unrevealed</li><li><b>Place of Birth</b>: Unrevealed</li></ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Characteristics</b></p><ul><li><b>Hair:</b> Blonde</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</li><li><b>Height:</b> 5'10\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 133 lbs (60 kg)</li><li><b>Gender</b>: Female</li></ul><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3><i><b>X-Men: The End</b></i></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Regan, along with Martinique , are known as the Ladies Mastermind.

    "deck": "Hate Monger is the name adopted by Adolf Hitler's consciousness throughout multiple cloned bodies. Armed with a gun that controls hatred, he wishes to plunge the world into racial purging. Hate-Monger has died several times, but his consciousness has always transferred itself to other bodies prolonging his existence.",
    "description": "<h2>Major Stories and Events</h2><h3>Origin</h3><p>The Hate-Monger is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9671\" href=\"/adolf-hitler/4005-9671/\">Adolf Hitler</a>, who ruled Nazi Germany as its Fueher from 1933 to 1945. In early 1945 the brilliant Nazi biologist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14876\" href=\"/arnim-zola/4005-14876/\">Arnim Zola</a> told Hitler that he had constructed a brain pattern-imprinting device by which the memories, personality and the actual consciousness of one brain could be transferred totally to another. Moreover, Zola told Hitler that he had discovered the process that is now known as cloning. Through these means, Zola believed he could keep the Fuehrer alive indefinitely. Intrigued, Hitler allowed Zola to \"energize\" his brain and to take a sample of his body's cells. Zola then cloned an entire brain from those cells.</p><p>On April 30, 1945, as the invading <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55706\" href=\"/russia/4020-55706/\">Russian</a> army closed in on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55686\" href=\"/berlin/4020-55686/\">Berlin</a>, Hitler, hidden in his capital buildings fortress-like bunker planned to kill his body and thanks to Zola's \"energizing\" process psionically transfer his consciousness into that cloned brain, which Zola was keeping safely far away. Hitler was interrupted by the arrival of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12605\" href=\"/jim-hammond/4005-12605/\">the Torch</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11835\" href=\"/toro/4005-11835/\">Toro</a>, who were determined to capture him and bring him to trial. When Hitler reached for a flame-proofed switch to detonate explosives that would kill the two, the Torch set him aflame.</p><p>As he died, Hitler willed his consciousness to transfer itself into that first cloned brain with the help of Zola's automatic brain pattern-imprinting device at the latter's laboratory.</p><p>It is not definitely known whether the consciousness in the cloned brain was the actual consciousness of Adolf Hitler, that thus survived Hitler's phsyical demise, or whether it was, instead, a duplicate of Hitler's consciousness. In either event, the first Hate Monger believed himself to be the original Adolf Hitler.</p><h3>Emergence as the Hate Monger</h3><p>Over the following decades, Zola cloned and grew entire bodies from his samples of Hitler's cells. Zola also treated the original cloned brain and each of those in the cloned bodies so that a life force and mental essence could be projected from one to another. The first cloned brain psionically transferred its consciousness into one of the clones' bodies. The being that was thereby created took the alias 'Hate Monger' because he believed that the means to world conquest lay in fomenting hatred among the various races. Warfare would then erupt from which, he believed, only his own Aryan 'master race' would survive.</p><p>Concealing his true identity beneath a hood, the Hate Monger began preaching class, racial, and religious hatred in the United States. At the same time, the Hate Monger was testing the effectiveness of his hate-ray on a major scale by using it to bring about civil war in the small Latin American nation of San Gusto. Hate Monger was opposed in San Gusto by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\" href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\" href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\">Nick Fury</a>. When the Hate Monger tried to fire a hate-ray at the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\" href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\">Human Torch</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\" href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> seized the Hate Monger's arm, ruining his aim. As a result, the Hate Monger accidentally hit two of his own men with the hate-ray, who then shot him dead.</p><p>But in dying, the Hate-Monger psionically transferred his consciousness to yet another of the bodies that Zola had cloned for him. The first Hate Monger thus transferred his consciousness into new bodies at least six times, including once into a humanoid body without a humanoid head, whose brain Zola intended to transplant physically into the body of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\">Captain America</a>.</p><p>Thus, although there have seemed to be a long succession of individuals matching the description of the first Hate Monger, each of whom died horribly, there has been, in fact, only one such Hate Monger, who, whenever he found himself on the point of death, psionically transferred his consciousness into another of the cloned bodies.</p><h3>Civil War and the Initiative</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1978067-cappunisher2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1978067\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 526px\" data-ratio=\"1.0817490494297\" data-width=\"526\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1978067-cappunisher2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1978067\"><img alt=\"The Punisher battles the Hate Monger\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1978067-cappunisher2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1978067-cappunisher2.jpg 526w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 887px) 100vw, 887px\" data-width=\"887\"></a><figcaption>The Punisher battles the Hate Monger</figcaption></figure><p>Garbed in a costume that combined Nazi icongraphy with the then-thought-dead <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\">Captain America</a>'s costume, the Hate Monger set out to restore America's past glories by purging it of non-whites and non-Christians. He led a chapter of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55830\" href=\"/national-force/4060-55830/\">National Force</a>, an army of racist malcontents, in the American Southwest, outfitted them with high-tech weapons, and led them on murderous cross-border raids on illegal immigrant camps in Mexico.</p><p>Photojournalist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43788\" href=\"/tatiana-arocha/4005-43788/\">Tatiana Arocha</a> alerted her boyfriend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15416\" href=\"/stuart-clarke/4005-15416/\">Stuart Clarke</a> and his ally <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\" href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\">the Punisher</a> to the atrocities, although her concern led her to be captured by the National Force. Infuriated by the Hate Monger's actions and his desecration of Captain America's costume, Castle infiltrated the National Force and impressed the Hate Monger by killing Arocha (while under the hate-amplifying H-ray generator's influence) as his initiation ritual. Once he had been accepted, Castle struck at the National Force clad in his own variation of Cap's costume, but he was soon defeated and captured.</p><p>Hate Monger put him before a firing squad and prepared to execute him only for his men to be shot by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\">SHIELD</a> agent <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15062\" href=\"/gw-bridge/4005-15062/\">G.W. Bridge</a>, who had been pursuing Castle. Hate Monger fled back to his base, which was under attack by the vengeful Clarke. Castle followed him there; after a furious battle, made all the more savage by the H-rays, Castle unmasked the Hate Monger and shot him in the head, once again killing him.</p><h3>The Heroic Age</h3><p>During the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56023\" href=\"/the-heroic-age/4045-56023/\">Heroic Age</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\">Steve Rogers</a> discovered one of the clones of Hitler retaining absolutely no memory of his programming. This clone goes by the name of Edmund Heidler and is a painter. Steve Rogers talks to him, trying to find any evidence of his original protocol, but he doesn't receive any other than a few racist comments. Leaving his art sale, Steve Rogers returns to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-38227\" href=\"/sharon-carter/4005-38227/\">Sharon Carter</a> who wants to flat out kill him, but is stopped by Rogers, who tells her that he hasn't done anything wrong. They agree to keep an eye on him. After Rogers leaves Heidler begins to subconsciously paint swastikas in his apartment.</p><h3>Fear Itself</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1885344-blapmwf523cvr1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1885344\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 527px\" data-ratio=\"1.5180265654649\" data-width=\"527\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1885344-blapmwf523cvr1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1885344\"><img alt=\"Hate Monger and the American Panther\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1885344-blapmwf523cvr1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56434/1885344-blapmwf523cvr1.jpg 527w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\"></a><figcaption>Hate Monger and the American Panther</figcaption></figure><p>A man named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12064\" href=\"/hate-monger/4005-12064/\">Josh Glenn</a> eventually emerges in the midst of the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56288\" href=\"/fear-itself/4045-56288/\">Fear Itself</a> crossover. Originally an office worker who became frustrated by what he perceived as persecution at the hands of immigrants, Glenn took it upon himsef to continue the Hate Monger's legacy after learning about the villain through various conspiracy theory websites. Glenn's paranoid anti-immigrant attitudes culminated in an attempt to steal firearms from a local pawn shop, which resulted in his capture at the hands of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\" href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\">Black Panther</a>.</p><p>Following Glenn's release, the consciousness of the original Hate Monger entered his body, as it did to his cloned bodies, granting him the abilities and experience of the real Hate Monger. The Hate Monger then set out to enact his revenge on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\" href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\">Black Panther</a>, recruiting a new nationalist vigilante known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-79323\" href=\"/american-panther/4005-79323/\">American Panther</a> as part of his scheme</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Scientists working for the Hate Monger created his greatest weapon, the \"hate-ray\" (or \"h-ray\"). This high-frequency microwave radiation affected the centers within the human brain controlling emotions so as to stimulate and magnify the victims feelings of dread, fear and anger to unusual levels including repressed or subconscious sentiments of this kind. The hate-ray could also transform feelings of love into equally strong or perhaps stronger hatreds. The hate-ray could be fired from a handgun selectively at one victim or a small number of victims. It could be projected from a space platform or satellite over wide areas of Earth or even projected from a base on Earth so as to \"bounce off\" the moon and blanket any area on the Earth that was facing the moon at that time.</p><p>The Hate Monger was a skilled brawler and a capable leader. He commanded a large subterranean base incorporating H-ray generators, which generated radiation that amplified feelings of anger, aggression, and hate in those nearby.</p><p>The Hate Monger appears incapable of dying due to his ability to psionically transfer his consciousness to other cloned bodies upon his demise. Although, this was briefly thwarted by a jealous <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\" href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\">Red Skull</a> who managed to trap the consciousness inside the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\" href=\"/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/\">Cosmic Cube</a>, behind the scenes, it escaped.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Simon Maddicks began his life in the United States military. After being raised in Williamsburg, Virginia Maddicks enlisted the moment he could, though much of his past is shrouded in mystery because of Maddick's lack of memory. After his term of service he was gainfully employed by the Roxxon Oil Company as a mercenary. He was shipped over to Brand Corporation's Mutagenics Laboratory where he underwent extensive physical training and genetic conditioning. He also underwent a procedure that implanted a tiny anti-gravity generator at the base of his spine which enables his flight. Upon his return to Roxxon he was given his costume and the codename \"Killer Shrike\".</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Ever since, Killer Shrike was most often seen getting beaten up by several super-heroes, most often the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\"> Hulk</a>. Killer Shrike was briefly a member of the <a href=\"/cardinal/4005-13392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13392\"> Cardinal</a>'s team of flying super villains known as <a href=\"/air-force/4060-42562/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42562\"> Air Force</a>. Killer Shrike was oddly absent when the team was blackmailed by <a href=\"/night-thrasher/4005-2098/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2098\"> Night Thrasher</a> into providing relief for Rwandan refugees. In New Warriors #54, Killer Shrike appears to have been murdered by the <a href=\"/soldiers-of-misfortune/4060-57496/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57496\"> Soldiers of Misfortune</a>. This was probably an art error as <a href=\"/oriole/4005-14064/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14064\"> Oriole</a>, not Killer Shrike, was with the team when blackmailed by Night Thrasher.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><p>During his employ at Roxxon, Maddicks was sent to infiltrate the subversive organization known only as the Conspiracy which Roxxon learned about through their business relationship with the Brand Corporation. The Conspiracy sent Killer Shrike to capture a powerful monster known as Goram. However, Maddicks was thwarted by <a href=\"/bloodstone/10960/\" data-ref-id=\"10960\"> Ulysses Bloodstone</a> who short-circuited Killer Shrike's electronic-based weapons resulting in severe injuries to the villain.</p><p>Feeling pity for Maddicks condition the agents of Bloodstone brought him to New York hospital where he remained comatose for several weeks. When he finally awoke Maddicks was contacted immediately by Brand scietists. The most predominate of which was a man named Stephen Weems. Weems, who is better known as <a href=\"/modular-man/13519/\" data-ref-id=\"13519\"> Modular Man</a> and is best recognized for his hatred of <a href=\"/spider-man/1443/\" data-ref-id=\"1443\"> Spider-Man</a> and <a href=\"/beast/1462/\" data-ref-id=\"1462\"> Beast</a>. Modular Man asked for Maddicks' assistance in killing the pair and in return would fill in the missing pieces of Maddicks' memory.</p><p>Maddicks agrees, however Weems is killed in battle before he could uphold his end of the bargain. Maddicks escaped Spider-Man and Beast and was contacted by agents of Brand Corp. They assisted in restoring his lost memories and assigning him further undercover work and as a bodyguard for Brand President James Melvin. However, this ended when the incorporeal <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/will-o-the-wisp/4005-15406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15406\">Will O' the Wisp </a>took control of Maddicks' battle suit in an attempt to avenge himself on Melvin. Spider-Man interceded and Melvin was saved.</p><h3>Secret War</h3><p>In the recent <a href=\"/secret-war/4050-18234/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18234\"> Secret War</a> miniseries, Killer Shrike's armor is updated off-panel by the <a href=\"/tinkerer/4005-3144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3144\"> Tinkerer</a>. Unfortunately, this still isn't enough for Maddicks to gain a victory, as he is soon defeated on television by the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\"> Avengers</a>, and turned over to<a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\"> S.H.I.E.L.D</a>. After being interrogated by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/jasper-sitwell/4005-7529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7529\">Jasper Sitwell</a> and <a href=\"/jimmy-woo/4005-7530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7530\">Jimmy Woo</a>, Shrike makes a deal in order to avoid being sent to <a href=\"/rykers-island/4020-55830/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55830\">Ryker's Island</a>, where Sitwell and Woo insinuate the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> and <a href=\"/hammerhead/4005-6817/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6817\">Hammerhead</a> are being incarcerated. However, arriving at the Tinkerer's base of operations, Maddicks unconvincingly tells the villain armorer he eluded capture. The Tinkerer responds by electrocuting the Shrike, and one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on the scene pronounces him dead. However, the Skrike apparently survives.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"> Civil War</a>, Killer Shrike would be captured by members of the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\"> Thunderbolts</a>. Killer Shrike registers under the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\"> Superhuman Registration Act</a> and join the Thunderbolts Army. The Thunderbolts had to fight off cities filled with civilians who were suddenly empowered when the <a href=\"/grandmaster/4005-32735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32735\"> Grandmaster</a> opened up the Wellspring of Power. The Thunderbolts were broken up into numerous squads and sent to various locations throughout the world. Killer Shrike was part of the Omega squad which also consisted of the <a href=\"/aqueduct/4005-2135/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2135\"> Aqueduct</a>, <a href=\"/the-ox/4005-38747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38747\"> Ox</a> and <a href=\"/slyde/4005-3780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3780\"> Slyde</a>. This group was responsible of maintaining order in Sydney, <a href=\"/australia/4020-55838/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55838\"> Australia</a>.</p><p>He was released from prison some time after, and went to live in a slum in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\"> New York City</a>. His release evoked Moon Knight's wrath, whose friend <a href=\"/frenchie/4005-27829/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27829\"> Frenchie</a> had originally brought Killer Shrike in. <a href=\"/moon-knight/4005-1493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1493\"> Moon Knight</a> paid a visit to the apartment building, mercilessly beating a man and throwing him down some stairs. It turns out that it was not Maddickes, who was in crowd watching the carnage.</p><h3>A Council Of Masters</h3><p><a href=\"/max-fury/4005-73456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73456\"> Max Fury</a> , the leader of the <a href=\"/shadow-council/4060-57698/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57698\">Shadow Council</a> has assembled a new <a href=\"/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\">Masters of Evil</a> in the sovereign nation of <a href=\"/bagalia/4020-57907/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57907\">Bagalia</a>; Killer Shrike is depicted as a member. Killer Shrike is present when Max Fury and the Masters of Evil capture <a href=\"/john-steele/4005-57571/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57571\">John Steele</a> after he attempts to escape Bagalia with the <a href=\"/serpent-crown/4055-15780/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15780\">Serpent Crown</a> and the Crown of Thorns.</p><h2>Other media</h2><p>In Iron Man: Armored Adventures, Killer Shrike is a <a href=\"/maggia/4060-26082/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26082\"> Maggia</a> agent who teams up with <a href=\"/unicorn/4005-13825/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13825\"> Unicorn</a> to kidnap Gene Khan, one of Tony Stark's friends. Iron Man manages to defeat him, and at the end of the episode, Unicorn and Killer Shrike are seen being tortured by the <a href=\"/mandarin/4005-52325/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52325\"> Mandarin</a>. The team of the Unicorn and the Shrike return in the second season, but are again defeated.</p>",
