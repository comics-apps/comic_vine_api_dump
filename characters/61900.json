    "description": "<p>From birth, Beryl Mudge secreted cherry-scented pheromones that rendered her irresistably lovable. Feeling smothered by the constant attention, she acted out in a rebellious manner, but even her acts of vandalism were immediately forgiven. When her younger sister Opal was similarly born with vanilla-scented pheromones, they were studied by scientists seeking to isolate the cause of their remarkable appeal. The corporation <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/godcorp/4060-59892/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59892\">Godcorp</a> realized that the sisters' pheromones could be exploited and marketed; however, Beryl refused to cooperate and attempted to take her sister away.</p><p>Godcorp, with the consent of Beryl's mother <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/jewel-mudge/4005-91399/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-91399\">Jewel Mudge</a>, had Beryl committed to a mental institution to keep her out of the way as they groomed Opal into the children's-toy character <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/vanilla-cupcake-tm/4005-90385/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90385\">Vanilla Cupcake TM</a> (protecting their trademark so fiercely that \"TM\" was actually part of the name). Beryl eventually escaped and began training herself in combat and weaponry to fight the forces of Godcorp. Assuming the name of Cherries Jubilee, she joined forces with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/destroyer-duck/4005-48250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48250\">Destroyer Duck</a>, who likewise sought revenge on Godcorp, and together they rescued Opal.</p><h2>Powers and Weapons</h2><p>Cherries Jubilee secretes powerful pheromones that make her irresistably appealing; she is able to persuade most people to do whatever she asks. Her power can be overcome by the use of a special gas mask that filters out her scent. Her pheromones are ineffective on the mentally unbalanced (such as the single-minded <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/booster-cogburn/4005-90387/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90387\">Booster Cogburn</a> clones).</p><p>She is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and has equipped herself with a variety of cherry-themed weapons: A supply of explosive \"cherry bombs,\" a five-pound iron \"jawbreaker\" necklace which she can wield as a flail, and a protective cherry-shaped helmet.</p><p> </p>",

He had become disillusioned at his job as students attention spans were becoming shorter. He sewed a costume of his own creation to become Banana Man. He then held a school assembly in the gymnasium where he preached the importance of potassium in the students’ diet. His speech was interrupted by a mysterious figure who was dressed in an ape outfit that had his own message about a bleak future where the Earth was overtaken by talking apes. This figure came to be known as Gorilla Guy.</p><p>Banana Man smacked Gorilla Guy with a banana which did not turn out to be an effective attack as Gorilla Guy responded with a punch that knocked him down. Banana Man then went and created a concrete banana and sewed a banana peel around it. Gorilla Guy thought this was simply a regular banana until Banana Man knocked him out with it. The students at the assembly had thought Banana Man was pretty strange, but after hearing what Gorilla Guy had to say they came to appreciate Banana Man. Gorilla Guy was able to slip away as Banana Man was basking in his glory.</p><p>Andre became obsessed with figuring out who Gorilla Guy was, but could not come up with a way to find him. He decided to attend a comic book convention where Linda Harrison, one of the stars of the original Planet of the Apes movie, was scheduled to appear. This turned out to work against Andre as the convention had lots of people dressed in gorilla costumes. Gorilla Guy did eventually reveal himself when he found out that Linda Harrison could talk. This enraged him because in the movie she was mute. Banana Man had created more weapons including nan-chucks and a bananarang, but he was topped by Gorilla Guy who had created a banana blade.</p><p>Banana Man was stuck paying for toys that were damaged in the battle. He did however find a raffle ticket that Gorilla Guy had dropped that was for his school raffle from which he deduced that Gorilla Guy must work at his school. While playing with his newly acquired convention toys, Andre was interrupted by Kelly, a fellow teacher, with whom he was supposed to meet to go over her lesson plans. Andre was very disappointed that because of his distractions with Gorilla Guy he had missed an opportunity to hang out with the hottest teacher in the school.</p><p>Andre then started looking around the school to find Gorilla Guy’s identity. After eliminating several teachers and the janitor, Andre was visited by a student, Alvin, who was offering to sell raffle tickets. Alvin informed Andre that he had been selling tickets in packs of five, so Andre offered to eliminate a detention he had given Alvin in exchange for Alvin rigging the raffle. Alvin would call off one of the tickets that was one number up from the ticket that Andre had found at the comic convention that was dropped by Gorilla Guy. During halftime of the school football game, Alvin called off the winning number where the winner would receive a George Foreman refrigerator.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/15/150171/3143054-bm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3143054\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.9433551198257\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:194.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/15/150171/3143054-bm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3143054\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px\" data-width=\"329\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/15/150171/3143054-bm.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/15/150171/3143054-bm.png 459w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/15/150171/3143054-bm.png 329w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/15/150171/3143054-bm.png\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/15/150171/3143054-bm.png 459w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/15/150171/3143054-bm.png 329w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px\" data-width=\"329\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The ticket belonged to Mr. Frank, the school science teacher. Banana man tackled Frank from behind, and accused him of being Gorilla Guy. Frank denied this, but Banana Man did not believe him until Gorilla Guy showed up behind him. Banana Man and Gorilla Guy had a brawl that encompassed the entire football field where Banana Man was finally victorious. Gorilla Guy was revealed to be Alvin who received another detention. Andre then started to notice a smell in his classroom where he discovered that someone had urinated.</p><p>Andre discussed this with the principal, Mr. John, who informed him that this had happened numerous times during the previous week. John decided to give Andre a chance to prove himself as Banana Man and assigned him the task of finding out the identity of the Tinkler. Andre was very proud of this, but he was made fun of by Mr. Frank who still resented being tackled. The two of them discovered the latest attack of the Tinkler in the teacher’s lounge where they found that the his attacks were not limited to the liquid method of human waste. Banana Man then created a cardboard cutout of himself that he wired with electricity to lure out the Tinkler.</p><p>This proved to be too tempting for the Tinkler as he was caught within minutes of it being set up. Andre was then reprimanded by John who did not approve of his methods. Luckily the student that was caught was not seriously injured, and he had a bad home life so his parents did not get involved. Andre was still discouraged that he was not making a difference in anyone’s life, and he tried making a poster to help better influence eating habits. This poster was defaced, and then the replacement poster was stolen. Frank continued to make fun of Andre to which Andre replied that he didn’t care if he only reached one student it would still be worth is effort. This did not stop Frank’s taunts, but Andre eventually realizes that his life was not that bad.</p><p>Unknown to Andre, it was revealed that there was a student that Banana Man’s influence had reached, and this student had stolen the poster to hang in his room at home. Mr. Frank was the next person to interrupt one of Banana Man’s assemblies. Frank was dressed in his own costume and called himself Yo-Yo Man. Banana Man chased him back to his office where Yo-Yo Man had set up a trap. Banana Man found himself strung upside down over a boiling vat of chocolate. He was able to escape with the help of Gorilla Guy.</p><p>Gorilla Guy had been suffering from a nutritional deficiency which he was able to overcome by eating more bananas. Together Banana Man and Gorilla Guy pummeled Yo-Yo Man. All three were reprimanded by the principal, Mr. John.</p><p>Banana Man should not be confused with Bananaman, an old British character.</p>",

It's produced by Studio Pierrot and first began airing in October 5, 2004. Kūkaku's first anime appearance was in <i>BLEACH</i> - Episode 23 <i>\"14 Days Before Rukia's Execution\"</i>, which aired on March 15 2005.</p><p>Her character in the Japanese series is voiced by Akiko Hiramatsu, and the U.S. dub produced by VIZ Media is done by Cindy Robinson.</p><p>Kūkaku Shiba's appearance is censored in the anime production. In the manga, she is shown with her right arm missing at all times, but for the anime a prosthetic right arm is added to the series. It's never shown to move. The particular reason for such an edit is unknown, but the series does have a practice of toning down graphically violent scenes of dismemberment.</p><p>Kūkaku plays a limited role in manga and only appears in the Soul Society arc, but she appears again in the several different filler arcs<em>.</em> She appearance is in the filler Bount Arc. She sends her brother to the the Earth realm to help in the battle against super powered humans called Bount, then punished him for not being of aid. Ichigo and Yoruichi return to Soul Society and come to see her when the Bount invade the Soul Society. She later appears in the filler Gotei 13 Invasion Army arc in a minor role.</p><h3>Games</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3124283\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3124283-0940652541-48579.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.73958333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3124283-0940652541-48579.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3124283\"><img alt=\"Kūkaku Shiba in BLEACH: Dark Souls (2007)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3124283-0940652541-48579.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3124283-0940652541-48579.png 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3124283-0940652541-48579.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kūkaku Shiba in BLEACH: Dark Souls (2007)\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3124283-0940652541-48579.png\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3124283-0940652541-48579.png 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3124283-0940652541-48579.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kūkaku Shiba in BLEACH: Dark Souls (2007)</figcaption></figure><p>As a series based mainly on fighting and battles, Kūkaku Shiba has made numerous playable appearances in the <i>BLEACH</i> series of games. her first appearance in games was in <em><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/bleach-dark-souls/61-20485/\">Bleach: Dark Souls</a> </em>for the Nintendo DS<i><b>.</b></i> that was released in Japan in February 15, 2007.</p><p><i>(For a full list of games that feature Kūkaku Shiba, see her profile on</i> <i><b>Giant Bomb</b></i>. <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/kuukaku-shiba/94-3833/\">HERE</a>)</p><p> </p>",

His name standing for \"William Rudolph's Ace in the Hole,\" the US Army would build a home for Wraith, and in return, he'd operate in secret for the Army during world crisis. His first major mission was to act as the bomb that was dropped over <a href=\"/nagasaki/4020-47912/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-47912\">Nagasaki</a>, which lead the world to believe the US had more nuclear arms than it did.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Wraith was created by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/superman-unchained/4050-63232/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-63232\">Superman Unchained</a> writer <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/scott-snyder/4040-58926/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-58926\">Scott Snyder</a> and artist <a href=\"/jim-lee/4040-2399/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2399\">Jim Lee</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Superman Unchained</h3><p>Wraith meets Superman in Superman Unchained, and is initially not presented as a villain. He has been doing secret missions for the US Military for decades, in a way, being the original \"Superman.\" He shows that he is stronger than Superman, and just as fast and durable when they fight the first time. Wraith comments that eventually he will have to kill Superman, for interfering with General Lane's plans. When nuclear missiles are released, aimed for countries all over the world, Wraith only agrees to help destroy the ones that will harm America, leaving Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and Superman to deal with the rest. When Wraith and Superman fight for a second time, Wraith easily dominates the fight, until Superman uses the radioactive isotope that weakens Wraith, formed by Batman, to drive him away. Soon after, Wraith goes to the Batcave to deal with Batman for this, dressed in armor to protect him from the radioactive isotope. He is met not only by Batman, who is using a stealth suit that hides him from Wraith, but Wonder Woman as well. Batman and Wonder Woman use everything in the Cave, including the batmobiles, other bat-vehicles, and the giant penny, but nothing is able to keep Wraith down. After Wraith attacks the duo with <a href=\"/rexie/4055-57539/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57539\">the robotic T-Rex</a> kept in the Batcave, Superman arrives to help Batman and Wonder Woman continue the battle.</p><p>Superman starts the fight aggressively, but Wraith uses his superior strength and speed to quickly take the upper hand and starts to manhandle Superman. Wraith also shows off many powers his longer time in the sun's radiation had given him. Superman realizes that he is outclassed and cannot beat Wraith with physical might. Using his brains, Superman grabs and flies Wraith into space where he couldn't breathe and tries to kill him that way, driving him all the way through the moon in the process. Wraith however uses his strength to overpower Superman, and then uses his energy powers to imitate the signature of Kryptonite to weaken Superman and bring the fight back to earth. On earth Wraith attempts to drown Superman in the ocean. With his face pressed into the bottom of the ocean, he realizes he isn't strong enough to beat Wraith, and digs down and takes the fight all the way to the core of the earth. Superman had known that the earth's magnetic field, which is strongest at the core, would interfere with Wraith's energy and electronic abilities, weakening him enough for Superman, with the help of the ring Batman gave him that weakens Wraith, to punch him out and leave him in the lava core of the earth.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><ul><li><b>Alien Physiology</b>: Wraith has a physiology that is similar to, but much stronger than that of Superman. Wraith notes that this amount of control over his energy signature has taken decades. His body is solar powered, but processes solar energy much more efficiently than Superman's body does.</li></ul><dl><dd><ul><li><b>Invisibility: </b>Wraith was able to use his powers of invisibility to follow Superman around and learn his secret identity.</li><li><b>Energy Absorption</b>: Wraith is capable of absorbing and manipulating the absorption of electromagnetic energy, especially solar power. His absorption, when controlled, averages at one hundred and sixty gigawatts of solar energy.</li><li><b>Energy Projection</b>: Wraith is capable of releasing powerful blasts of energy that are capable of destroying large metal structures, causing them to detonate.<sup><a href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Wraith_(Prime_Earth)#cite_note-SU_8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br /></a></sup></li><li><b>Energy Transference</b>: Wraith is capable of manipulating his energy signature to such a degree that he can transform his body in minor ways such as developing spikes that can emit the same signature as Kryptonite.<sup><a href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Wraith_(Prime_Earth)#cite_note-SU_8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br /></a></sup></li><li><b>Flight: </b>Wraith can fly as fast as Superman can.</li><li><b>Sound Manipulation:</b> Capable of tightening his throat muscles to create an echo chamber in order to release a sonic attack from his mouth.<sup><a href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Wraith_(Prime_Earth)#cite_note-2\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br /></a></sup></li><li><b>Superhuman Durability</b>: Wraith is far more durable than Superman, due to his being exposed to sunlight longer and using it more efficiently.</li><li><b>Superman Speed</b>: Wraith is capable of easily catching a punch from Superman, and in their third encounter Superman admitted that Wraith was faster.</li><li><b>Superhuman Strength</b>: Possesses a strength greater than that of Superman, able to kick him halfway across the continental United States, and manhandle him easily in a fight.<sup><a href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Wraith_(Prime_Earth)#cite_note-3\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br /></a></sup></li></ul></dd></dl><h3>Weakness</h3><p>Wraith was shown to be susceptible to a select radioactive isotope that reacts with his specific energy signature that weakens him to the point where he is no longer able to fight Superman.</p>",

This is a rare inherited trait that is passed down through various ninja clans. This is normally preformed by combining different natures of chakra to create a new form. Kurotsuchi's kekkei genkai is used by combining Earth and Fire Styles to then create Lava Style justu. Very few ninja have this level of talent and control to use or master these techniques.</p><ul><li><strong>Earth Style: Earth Done Jutsu:</strong> The Earth Done technique is basic level Earth Style jutsu. Using it created a dome of varying size to shield the user. Kurotsuchi has use this technique to shield herself from tons of falling rock.</li><li><strong>Earth Style: Erupt (土遁・開土昇掘, <em>Doton: Kaido Shōkutsu</em>):</strong> By pressing the hands on the ground, the user of this technique can forcibly eject a large number of enemies that have hidden themselves undergroud out of what appears as a large volcano. Kurotsuchi has used this this technique to reveal a large number of White Zetsu that mostly travel underground.</li><li><strong>Lava Style: Quicklime Jutsu (熔遁・石灰凝の術, <em>Yōton: Sekkaigyō no Jutsu</em>):</strong> Using her kekkei genkai, Kurotsuchi creates a corrosive quicklime sludge she fires from her mouth. Even if she misses her initial strike, she can combine the attack with water to capture a target as it turns the quicklime into a substance harder than cement.</li><li><p><strong>Water Style: Trumpet (水遁・水喇叭, <em>Suiton: Mizurappa</em>):</strong> Kurotsuchi uses this technique by firing a huge torrent of water from her mouth and compressed through her hands to increase the focus and pressure. She uses this in combination with her Quicklime Jutsu to transform it into cement.</p></li></ul><h2>Weapons &amp; Equipment</h2><h2>Statistics</h2><p><b>Affiliation:</b> Hidden Stone Village</p><p><b>Rank:</b> Unknown</p><p><strong>Registered Ninja #:</strong><b> </b>Unknown</p><p><strong>Date Of Birth: </strong>Unknown</p><p><b>Age:</b> 17</p><p><b>Zodiac Sign:</b> Unknown</p><p><b>Height:</b> 163.6cm</p><p><b>Weight:</b> ??kg</p><p><b>Blood Type:</b> Unknown</p><p><b>Completed Assignments:</b></p><ul><li><b>D-Rank</b> ?? <b>/ C-Rank</b> ?? <b>/ B-Rank</b> ?? <b>/ A-Rank</b> ?? <b>/ S-Rank</b> ??</li></ul><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Anime</h3><h4>Naruto Shippuden (2007)</h4><p>The <i>Naruto Shippuden </i> anime series is the second direct adaptation of Masashi Kishimoto's original manga.

One of these meteors landed in <a href=\"/budapest/4020-57786/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57786\">Budapest</a>, causing widespread destruction.

Arkea used her power to possess machinery to stop a train they were traveling on and kill the drivers, although the intervention of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> prevented any further loss of life. Arkea left Shogo's body after Jubilee arrived at the<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/jean-grey-school-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\"> Jean Grey School</a>, opting instead use the body of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/omega-sentinel/4005-3421/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3421\">Karima Shapandar</a> as a way to take over the school's computer system.</p><p>Sublime, who had followed Jubilee and Shogo to the school to warn the X-Men about his sister, explained that Shogo had essentially been \"reset\" upon Arkea leaving him - and also offered the opinion that Shogo was Jubilee's son. While the X-Men and Sublime tracked down and dealt with the Arkea threat in a specialized hospital in Budapest, Shogo and Jubilee stayed behind in a van. As Jubilee gave Storm and the team intel on the hospital's layout, she multitasked by searching records to see if Shogo had any living relatives. By the time the X-Men and a now recovered Karima returned to the van, Jubilee explained with confidence that Shogo Lee was 100% hers.</p><h3>Battle of the Atom</h3><p>During <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/battle-of-the-atom/4045-57313/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-57313\"><em>Battle of the Atom</em></a> it was shown that one of the future X-Men that were introduced, Sentinel X, is actually Shogo who appears in an <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/iron-man-armor/4055-50749/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50749\">Iron Man Armor</a> style battle-suit. When that future version of Jubilee was killed, Sentinel X consoled the much younger present-day-version of Jubilee and let her know that she will continue to be a wonderful mother and raise him well. This gave her the assurance that she did the right thing by adopting him.</p><h3>Further Adventures</h3><p>Baby Shogo continued to accompany his mother, Jubilee, while she remained an active member of the X-Men. When Jubilee took a break from the team, Shogo accompanied her as she became Patsy Walker's assistant. Patsy and all of her friends immediately fell in love with Shogo and his cute antics, with some of her friends offering to babysit when his mom had to go to work. Shogo will return to the X-Mansion yet again when his mom becomes the leader and teacher of Generation X.</p>",
