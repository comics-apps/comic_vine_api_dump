    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Living in Baytown, Texas, Wallace Jackson was a 16-year old, who wore a costume designed by his uncle who worked for NASA.  He decided to come to New York City to play fight with his favorite superhero, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\">    Spider-Man</a>.  Spider-Man did his best to outsmart the kid, and they fought until they crashed through a window at the State Street Hospital.  Red Nine had a high fever and passed out, so Spider-Man left him there.  Red Nine woke up and looked for Spider-Man again, and this time Spider-Man destroyed Red Nine's costume, but Spider-Man later learned that Wallace helped a group of elderly patients against a mean hospital administrator.    <br/><h3>The Initiative </h3>Years later, Red Nine appears in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42789\" href=\"/camp-hammond/4020-42789/\" slug=\"camp-hammond\">    Camp Hammond</a>, as an official recruit for <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42781\" href=\"/the-initiative/4060-42781/\" slug=\"the-initiative\">    the Initiative</a>, along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6774\" href=\"/ant-man/4005-6774/\" slug=\"ant-man\">    Ant-Man</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46121\" href=\"/crusader/4005-46121/\" slug=\"crusader\">    Crusader</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49652\" href=\"/melee/4005-49652/\" slug=\"melee\">    Melee</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15673\" href=\"/geldoff/4005-15673/\" slug=\"geldoff\">   Geldoff</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-37247\" href=\"/dragon-lord/4005-37247/\" slug=\"dragon-lord\">    Dragon Lord</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49905\" href=\"/geiger/4005-49905/\" slug=\"geiger\">    Geiger</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25689\" href=\"/diamondback/4005-25689/\" slug=\"diamondback\">    Diamondback</a>.   He was one of the trainees that tried to defeat <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50660\" href=\"/kia/4005-50660/\" slug=\"kia\">   K.I.A.</a>, but lost.  During the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\" href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" slug=\"secret-invasion\">   Secret Invasion</a>, he along with the other recruits, participated in the attack against the invading <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\" href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" slug=\"skrulls\">   Skrulls</a>.  After being surrounded, they were saved by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\" href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" slug=\"nick-fury\">   Nick Fury</a> and his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-32653\" href=\"/howling-commandos/4060-32653/\" slug=\"howling-commandos\">   Commandos</a>.  Red Nine was also among the heroes who took part in the final battle in Times Square.  Red 9 was among those heroes who approached the Skrull ship which contained everyone who was replaced by the Skrulls prior to the invasion. Upon completion of Camp Hammond's training program, Red 9 was assigned to the Georgia state Initiative team, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56101\" href=\"/the-cavalry/4060-56101/\" slug=\"the-cavalry\">   Cavalry</a>.  Red 9 participated in the cleanup at Camp Hammond following the battle with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47573\" href=\"/ragnarok/4005-47573/\" slug=\"ragnarok\">   Ragnarok</a>.<h3>Fear Itself<br/></h3>Commander <a href=\"///\"> </a><a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">        Steve Rogers</a> informs <a href=\"///\"> </a><a href=\"../../prodigy/29-4804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">           Prodigy</a>  of the unknown meteors that have fallen from the  heavens and mass panic is on the horizon.

Prodigy agrees to become the leader of the new Initiative and most of  the former Initiative members including Red 9 gather in Washington DC. <br/><br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Red Nine wears a costume which allows him to fly, and gives him superhuman strength.  The costume also gives him a force field which protects him from harm, and enables him to shoot energy bolts.",

    "deck": "An accident with a Gamma Accelerator would give normal Delilah Deerborn the power to become the Gamma-Power Mimicing hero, Geiger. Now a new recruit in the Initiative.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Origin</h2><p>Delilah \"Dee Dee\" Deerborn was just your average run of the mill college girl. She is a Physics Major at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\" href=\"/empire-state-university/4020-43783/\" slug=\"empire-state-university\">                        Empire State University</a> (ESU) currently. For Delilah, life was very uneventful. This would change the day she accidentally was caught in a lab experiment gone wrong while using the Gamma-Accelerator. Sounds very similar to the story of your friendly neighborhood spider, except his was a spider bite. She would be soaked in Gamma-Radiation and like so many before her, it would alter on the genetic level. In this case Delilah was granted super powers. She was now able to mimic the powers of other Gamma-Powered individuals around her. Her powers don't stop there, they also allow her to mimic their physical appearance and personality as well. If unchecked that personality could overwhelm her and taker her over. Not a horrible situation if they have a calm attitude, but to copy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\" href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" slug=\"hulk\">                       the Hulk</a> in an angry rage would be a problem.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs<br/></h2><h3>Doc Samson to the rescue</h3><p>Not catching a break, there would be no adjustment period for Delilah, just minutes later and she along with her new powers would go on a test drive. The villain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57989\" href=\"/patchwork/4005-57989/\" slug=\"patchwork\">                      Patchwork</a> would be in her vicinity and Delilah's powers automatically activated. Lacking experience, Patchwork's personality takes over and Geiger begins to rage out of control. Thankfully, yet another Gamma-Powered being was around, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4315\" href=\"/doc-samson/4005-4315/\" slug=\"doc-samson\">                     Doc Samson</a>, to save the day. Doc Samson and Geiger would fight for a moment until they decide to work together to be rid of the true evil Patchwork. Understanding Geiger esoteric powers he also gives her a lock of his hair. That way if she ever feels like a monster is going to take over, all she would need to do is concentrate on the hair. This would allow her to mimic Doc Samson's powers instead.</p><h3>Drafted into the Initiative</h3><p>Around the time that Geiger's powers first emerged, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\" href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" slug=\"iron-man\">                    Iron Man</a> was looking for his second crop of fresh faced <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42781\" href=\"/the-initiative/4060-42781/\" slug=\"the-initiative\">                  Initiative</a> recruits. Geiger was defiantly being watched by him. When time came to perform the draft for the new recruits, Geiger would be a shoe in. Out with old, in with the new. The last group of recruits had just graduated and been given placement to their team it was time for the next batch. Shortly after a bus load of new recruits were exiting the bus and meeting their Drill Instructor, the one time villain, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4578\" href=\"/taskmaster/4005-4578/\" slug=\"taskmaster\">                   Taskmaster</a>. His new group of recruits would include: Geiger, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-37247\" href=\"/dragon-lord/4005-37247/\" slug=\"dragon-lord\">                  Dragon Lord</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49904\" href=\"/red-9/4005-49904/\" slug=\"red-9\">                  Red 9</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15673\" href=\"/geldoff/4005-15673/\" slug=\"geldoff\">                  Proton</a> (Geldoff), Ant-Man, the Crusader, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49652\" href=\"/melee/4005-49652/\" slug=\"melee\">                  Melee</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25689\" href=\"/diamondback/4005-25689/\" slug=\"diamondback\">                  Diamondback</a>.</p><h3>Training at Camp Hammond</h3><p>After meeting their new Drill Instructor, the new recruits would already be put to the test. The first test was to battle the Taskmaster as a group. This was the best way he could gauge their skills. Geiger and the others tried as best as they could but they would still lose the fight. Next the Taskmaster would take them to the combat simulator room. Once there, they would do battle with robots. Once again, so that he could test their abilities. Unfortunately before they could start the new recruits would be interrupted by one of clones, KIA, rampaging and destroying everything in sight including the recruits. Geiger and the other newbie’s would attempt to engage KIA in battle but are outclassed, out powered and out skilled. KIA quickly dismantles the new recruits and moves on. Eventually he is stopped but not before he destroyed nearly everything. Geiger put up a valiant effort in the fight but still lost. The Taskmaster would find her knocked unconscious, defeated by KIA. Not everyone was so lucky. Dragon Lord of the new recruits would unfortunately meet his doom, getting killed in battle against KIA. Once the dust settled, the only thing everyone could do is recover because this was just the beginning of their training in the Initiative at Camp Hammond.  <br/>After her training period Geiger was placed on the New Mexico Initiative Team <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56108\" href=\"/the-mavericks/4060-56108/\" slug=\"the-mavericks\">                         The Mavericks</a>. <br/></p><h3>Fear Itself</h3><p>Commander <a href=\"///\"> </a><a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">              Steve Rogers</a> informs <a href=\"///\"> </a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-4804\" href=\"/prodigy/4005-4804/\" slug=\"prodigy\">                 Prodigy</a>  of the unknown meteors that have fallen from the  heavens and mass panic is on the horizon. Rogers asks Prodigy to gather  heroes on a volunteer basis to help keep the peace and lead a new  Initiative where there is no forced conscription or registration.  Prodigy agrees to become the leader of the new Initiative and most of  the former Initiative members including Geiger gather in Washington DC.   <br/><br/>Geiger is assigned to help out in New Jersey with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40452\" href=\"/gravity/4005-40452/\" slug=\"gravity\">             Gravity</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\" href=\"/firestar/4005-2101/\" slug=\"firestar\">            Firestar</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-34529\" href=\"/frog-man/4005-34529/\" slug=\"frog-man\">           Frog-Man</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48634\" href=\"/patrick/4005-48634/\" slug=\"patrick\">          Scarlet Spider</a> where they assist civilians from a burning building. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\" href=\"/crossbones/4005-3225/\" slug=\"crossbones\">         Crossbones</a> would escape from the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\" href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" slug=\"the-raft\">        Raft</a> after a mystical hammer fell from the sky and crashed into the prison facility. Crossbones was inside the building and already killed several officers and innocent civilians. Crossbones comes into conflict with Geiger and her teammates. Geiger is hospitalized after she uses her body as a shield when Crossbones throws a grenade at the Initiative members. <br/><br/></p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Powers</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"> </ul> <p>Geiger's gamma charged body allows her to mimic/copy the powers, abilities, appearance and personality of anyone with gamma radiation based powers in her vicinity. Geiger's power has incredible potential. She could be as strong as and invulnerable as the Hulk or immensely intelligent like the Leader. Though the drawback is if she loses control she could assume their personalities too. <br/> <br/><b>Power Mimicry: </b><br/>Geiger's power allows her to copy/mimic of other Gamma-Powered super beings in her direct vicinity. Not only can she mimic the full extent of their powers but also their appearance and personality. If she is around two Gamma beings she will assume the powers of the one with the strongest Gamma reading. <br/> <br/><b>Telepathy </b><br/>Geiger is able to mentally access the minds of Gamma power beings. It is yet to be seen if she is able to communicate through this tactic or not.</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"> </ul><b>Tracking: </b><br/>Anyone who has a Gamma reading, Geiger can track. <br/> <br/><b>Siphon Abilities: </b><br/>Geiger is able to siphon the strength of other Gamma-powered beings. <br/> <br/><b>Morphing: <br/></b>When around Gamma-Beings, Geiger can either willingly or sometimes involuntarily assume the appearance of them. So effective is this, that she was mistaken for the criminal Patchwork by Doc Samson. <br/><br/><p><b>Special Equipment:</b> <br/>A Lock of Hair from Doc Samson</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"> </ul> <p>She maintains his hair so that if she feels the presence of another gamma powered individual in her vicinity she can focus on the hair and not be overwhelmed.</p><p><b>Special Abilities:</b> <br/>Because her body is attuned to gamma power beings, she can easily track them with no problem.</p><p><b>Limitations:</b> <br/>Due to her lack of experience with her powers, Geiger can easily become overwhelmed and lose control to her powers. This is a negative thing because her powers also mimic the personality of the gamma-powered super beings. If she is overcome by a villain, her personality will match theirs.</p><p>Another significant limitation is that her powers only work if there is a Gamma-powered being present. If not she is, for the most part a normal human.</p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h3>Status</h3><p>Known Relatives: Unrevealed</p><p>Citizenship: Citizen of the United States; with no criminal record.</p><p>Place of Birth: Unrevealed, presumably in Massachusetts.</p><p>Marital Status: Single</p><p>Occupation: Student, Initiative Recruit &amp; Adventurer</p><p>Education: Attends college student at Empire State University.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2> <p>Lyra Orphée, though a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45999\" href=\"/silver-saints/4060-45999/\" slug=\"silver-saints\">Silver Saint</a>, was said to have power rivaling that of a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45998\" href=\"/gold-saints/4060-45998/\" slug=\"gold-saints\">Gold Saint</a>.  He was famous throughout Sanctuary for his skill with the lyre. The story of Lyra Orphée is nearly identical to that of the mythological Orpheus.  Orphée's lover, Eurydice, was bitten by a venomous snake and died.  Orphée ventured into the Underworld to ask <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56083\" href=\"/hades/4005-56083/\" slug=\"hades\">Hades</a> to revive her.  He played his lyre for Hades, who was so touched by the beauty and sadness of the music that he agreed to grant Eurydice new life.  However, he warned Orphée not to look back until they were both safely out of the Underworld.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56089\" href=\"/pandora/4005-56089/\" slug=\"pandora\">Pandora</a> was worried that this might set a dangerous precedent, and ordered <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56149\" href=\"/pharaoh-of-sphinx/4005-56149/\" slug=\"pharaoh-of-sphinx\">Sphinx Pharaoh </a>to see to it that Orphée did not make it out of the Underworld.  Pharaoh tricked Orphée into thinking that he had seen the entrance to the world of the living, so he looked back at Eurydice, only to see that her body had been turned to stone.  Unable to part with his beloved, Orphée decided to stay in the Underworld with her. </p> <h2>Major Story Arcs</h2> <p><u>Hades Chapter</u></p> <p>When Sphinx Pharaoh was about to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45448\" href=\"/seiya-saint-of-pegasus/4005-45448/\" slug=\"seiya-saint-of-pegasus\">Pegasus Seiya </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45459\" href=\"/shun-saint-of-andromeda/4005-45459/\" slug=\"shun-saint-of-andromeda\">Andromeda Shun</a>, Orphée interfered.  He used \"Stringer Nocturne\" and made it appear as though he had finished them off, but had actually spared their lives.  Sphinx merely believed that Orphée had been trying to steal the credit for defeating the Bronze Saints.  Seiya and Shun come across Orphée's garden, where they find Eurydice, who tells them her story and begs them to save Orphée.  The Lyra Saint arrives, and orders the Bronzes to leave.  There is a flash of light, much like the one that deceived Orphée when he was leaving the Underworld.  It was Sphinx, and Orphée realizes that he had been tricked, and Sphinx was responsible for his misfortune.  Orphée challenged Sphinx, pitting his lyre against Pharaoh's death harp.  Pharaoh severed the \"G\" string of Orphée's lyre, believing he had rendered the Silver Saint incapable of using offensive moves.  But Orphée held the string between his teeth and killed Sphinx Pharoah with \"Stringer Finé.\"  <br/>He then realized that all living things must eventually die, and that he did no one any good by continuing to mourn his beloved.  Eurydice was truly happy that Orphée had returned to the honorable Saint she fell in love with.  Having regained his pride as a Saint, Orphée made a plan with Seiya and Shun to attack Hades--they would have a perfect chance, since it was the day that he was scheduled to play for the Lord of the Underworld.   <br/>He arrived at Hades' chamber with a large case.  Pandora, immediately suspicious, opened it, only to find that it was full of flowers, which Orphée claimed he had brought for Hades.  Pandora stabbed her spear into the flowers, but found nothing.  Orphée grew worried when he saw that the Three Judges of Hell had also arrived to hear him play.  He used \"Death Trip Serenade\" to lure the three of them, along with Pandora, into a deep sleep.  He lunged at Hades, but the figure he saw turned out to only be an illusion.  A beam of energy suddenly ripped through his chest, and he saw <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56090\" href=\"/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/\" slug=\"rhadamanthys-of-wyvern\">Wyvern Rhadamanthys </a>standing before him, unaffected by the music.  Seiya and Shun leaped out from the case to aid Orphée.  Knowing that his wound was fatal, Orphée held on to Rhadamanthys to give Seiya a clear shot.  Seiya reluctantly used his Ryu Sei Ken on the Specter and the Saint.  Wyvern would survive, but the Lyra Saint would not.  As his life left him, he entrusted the protection of Athena to the Bronze Saints and whispered Eurydice's name, happy that he could now truly join her.</p> <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2> <p>Like all of the Saints of Athena, Orphée possesses superhuman strength, speed, and agility, in addition to the incredible defense granted to him by his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56738\" href=\"/saint-cloth/4055-56738/\" slug=\"saint-cloth\">Cloth</a>.  All of his attacks are produced by playing a specific melody on his lyre.  His primary technique is \"Stringer Nocturne\"--the strings of Orphée's lyre entangle his opponent and electrocute them.  \"Stringer Finé\" involves the strings of the lyre brutally cutting his enemy.  \"Death Trip Serenade\" lures his enemies to sleep; it's duration, anywhere from a few days to an entire eternity, is determined by Orphée.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Kiba has a trusty companion he found named Akamaru. He has been with Kiba nearly all of Kiba's life. Akamaru can also transform into the exact shape of Kiba. He helps Kiba in the fight against Naruto by confusing him. Then Kiba goes for the finishing strike.</p><p>When they are trapped with Naruto, Choji, and Neji, Akamaru and Kiba use the jutsu to try and bust it open. But it turns out that the rock wall was actually reinforced with chakara and would regenerate itself when hit. So as Akamaru and Kiba kept attacking the wall, Neji studied the wall and its weal points where it took more time to regenerate the rock. So once Neji knew where the weak points in the structure were, he told Kiba and Akamaru where to attack, and soon enough they were free.</p><p>Akamaru can sense how strong ans enemy is by smelling their chakra level. Another thing is Kiba is the only one who understands Akamarubecause they have such a close bond.</p><p>Akamaru was a present to Kiba from his mother and his sister when he went off to the academy. His mother has wolves instead of dogs like Akamaru. Kibas sister is a vet which is useful when Akamaru was injured in the battle against Sakon and Ukon from the sound 4.</p><p>One of Akamarus techniqes is marking the opponent so him and Kiba can do their most powerful jutsu. The reason Akamaru marks the enemy is because during this jutsu you are completly blind because your twisting so fast bu with Akamarus smell he can easily find his target that he marked.</p><p>Akamaru also has another technique that after Kiba gives him a special pill his fur becomes red and he is twice as strong. Akamaru also uses this technique when Kiba faught Naruto in the Chunin exams, it did not last long but he hurt Naruto badly. Also when Kiba was fighting the demon, it was trying to take over Kiba's body. He had to stab himself to get the demon off because the demon felt whatever pain Kiba did. Before he did that he had to get Akamaru to hold the demon off, in the red fur form. After that Akamaru fell unconcious and they were able to get away.</p><p>During the Chunin exams Kiba used Akamaru to cheat on the test.</p><p>Akamaru owes his life to Kiba's sister because after the fight with the two headed fiend he was in bad shape.</p>",

He knows where a lot of Go salons are so he and Hikaru can brush up on their skills. His other friends name is Waya. He's one of Hikaru's classmates at the inei school. Both of them are studying to become professional Go players.</p><p>Sai is a ghost that used to play Go in ancient times. No one can see him except Hikaru because he awakened him. He plays Go through those who awaken him so that means Hikaru has an unfair advantage against the other players.</p><p>Akira Toya is a Go legend and he is the same age as Hikaru. Akira has been Hikaru's rival ever since he lost a game to Sai who played through Hikaru to help him win because the last time Akira and Hikaru played Go Hikaru lost and Akira said that he was pitiful and not even worth playing. Hikaru didn't want Akira to feel like that this game so he won using Sai. After that match Akira went crazy and he said there was no way he could have won and he pledged that he'd find out how he did it.</p><p>One time korean Go pros came to Japan. Hikaru was an idiot and said that he'd never heard of korean pros before. After he said that a young pro got really mad but he stayed calm and sat down. Hikaru asked him if he was challenging him to a game. The young boy told him that it would be better practice to play anyone else in the Go salon then to play him. After that Hikaru got really mad and sat down to. He told the kid choose a color and they started to play. Once they started to play the Korean kid was making one good move after another. Hikaru was doing the same. Then HIkaru made a bad move or so the other pro thought, but it turned out that Hikaru was setting up a move that would put him in the lead. When the match ended Hkaru reigned victorious by one and a half points.</p>",

    "description": "<p>\"Choopie,\" as he has been so labeled...named, was detected and apprehended by Red Team in the Spring of 1996. A vicious and voracious predator, he was one of a suspected group of such creatures creating a flap of sightings in the suburbs of Puerto Rico at that time. (How these creatures originally gained egress to our realm from their own still remains a mystery as the dimensional integrity was violently rent rather than weakened via natural entropic means.)</p><p>The creature was captured while attempting to wrest a kitten it had pursued from the manifold of a 1987 Honda Civic. Choopie was studied for several days by BEDLAM's BioLogic Department, but was soon exposed to Dr. Alazar's Evolvo-Ray at the request of Big. The treatment resulted in a creature with a personality very much like that of a 6 year old boy. Though his phenomenal speed, agility, and ability to fly make him a potentially invaluable agent, Choopie is, in my opinion, erratic and unreliable, and often is the cause of much damage within the BEDLAM facility. He is, I'm told, quite fond of, and loyal to, Arisa and the rest of her team and so carries out assignments and missions with the best of intentions.</p>",

    "deck": "Big began life as a sasquatch who was put through an Evolvo-Ray during the formation of BEDLAM. He became a super genius and became a Perhapanaut in Blue Team.",
    "description": "<p>\"BIG\" has been at BEDLAM actually since before there was a BEDLAM. Captured in 1973 in the Northern Corridor section of British Columbia, Big was captured and held for several years by Project Entua, a clandestine government program designed to retrieve and study cryptozoological specimens from around the world.</p><p>When BEDLAM was formed, it was Drs. Alazar and Das (see files: Alazar, Antonio, PhD — Das, Baldev MD FAAP) who petitioned for the Sasquatch to be brought here and soon was the first subject to undergo Alazar's rudimentary Evolvo-Ray.</p><p>An already strong creature, Big was soon displaying feats of immeasurable strength and dexterity. But it was the incredible emergence of intelligence and subsequent accumulation of knowledge that astounded the Doctors and BEDLAM Staff alike. Not long after, Big was a colleague rather than subject and soon was working side-by-side with the Doctors to perfect the very Evolvo-Ray that brought him into the future. His intelligence quotient ratings exceed the scale and his ability to comprehend grossly abstract theories (and realities) is, to me, astounding to experience.</p><p>Recently, for reasons of his own (my guess is that he wishes to both supervise Choopie and work closely with our newest acquisition, MG), Big has accepted Arisa's invitation to join Blue Team. He has always proven to be both a resourceful and effective agent and his presence on the team, I'll admit, has me resting much easier as well.</p>",

The Foot were commissioned by the Utroms to be their protection when the Utroms first made public, alien contact with Earth.

She is knowledgeable in many weapon fighting styles, but is typically depicted with a single sword.</p><h3><strong>Intellect</strong></h3><p>She is incredibly clever and cunning with the great ability to improvise in tight situations. She is willing to break form in order to gain the upperhand on an opponent.

This is due to many of the storylines from the television show drawing inspiration from the original comics.</p><p>However, there are minor tweaks to the character in the show from the comic portrayal.</p><p>In the comics, Karai never formally knew Oraku Saki - <a href=\"/shredder/4005-42406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42406\">The Shredder</a> - and was merely his replacement to get the New York Foot Branch back in order. In the television series, it is shown that Karai grew up with Oraku Saki and was considered his daughter. This relationship was shown to be adoptive rather than biological as proven later by The Shredder actually being a rogue Utrom. There is much more vehemence between Karai and the Turtles due to her animosity over their interference and banishment of Shredder from earth. In this sense, Karai takes over the Foot in the name of vengeance for her father. She is much more angry than in her other portrayals.</p><p>After a climatic battle with the Tengu Shredder, Karai no longer desires to fight the turtles. In the final episode, she is a guest at Casey &amp; April's wedding.</p><h4>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3879196\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5609375\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3879196\"><img alt=\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg 1280w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg 960w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg 1280w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg 960w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130627/3879196-8040908852-14022.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</figcaption></figure><p>Karai is voiced by Kelly Hu.</p><h3>Film</h3><h4>TMNT (2007)</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2118095\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67602/2118095-iv00151.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.42672919109027\" data-width=\"853\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 853px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67602/2118095-iv00151.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2118095\"><img alt=\"TMNT (2007)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67602/2118095-iv00151.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67602/2118095-iv00151.jpg 853w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67602/2118095-iv00151.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"TMNT (2007)\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67602/2118095-iv00151.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67602/2118095-iv00151.jpg 853w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67602/2118095-iv00151.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>TMNT (2007)</figcaption></figure><p>This portrayal of Karai is very true to her comics portrayal. She is brought in to fill in as the replacement to The Shredder from Japan. She is clearly Japanese, and is soft-spoken countering her immense strength and power. She acknowledges the Turtles as potential threats to the Foot and is upfront about the need for action to be taken against the Turtles for their role in the elimination of The Shredder. This mindset stems more from her orders to do so than any personal anger towards the Turtles themselves.</p><p>Initially, she works for Winters to provide him with protection as he seeks to end his immortality. She ends up creating a truce with the Turtles in order to banish the demons and the traitorous stone soldiers back to where they came from. They never said it was Karai, but she was the leader of the foot clan, so the watcher can infer that she is Karai.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Biography</h2><h3>Volume 1</h3><p>Dr. Baxter Stockman was a sociopathic scientist that developed killer robots called Mousers that he announced to the press would solve New York city's vermin problem. In truth the robots had an ulterior purpose of burrowing under the city and stealing the money from bank vaults. When his computer programmer <a href=\"/april-oneil/4005-44968/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44968\">April O'Neil</a> started to grow suspicious of the Mouser's true purpose Stockman led her to an underground factory were he was developing hundreds of Mousers. When she questioned why he would do this as he could make millions legaly, he answered that money is only an incidental by product. He was really doing it \"because it's FUN\". When April tried to get away Stockman opened a trap door to sewer level and set the Mousers on her.</p><p>Stockman stepped up his plans when he sent a video of himself surrounded in shadow saying that his intention was to extort money from the city but holding buildings hostages, if a ransome was not delivered via his complex method he would destroy the building in question. To show he was not joking he used his Mousers to destroy the Retxab Building, claiming that one of the World Trade Center towers would be next if he did not recieve twenty million dollars. His plan was thwarted when April unexpectedly turned up alive with her rescuers, the <a href=\"/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/4060-26934/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26934\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> to stop him. The four turtles easily managed to subdue Stockman but not before he initiated a program that recalled the Mousers to the lab were they would self destruct on arrival and sealed all the exits. April and <a href=\"/donatello/4005-44709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44709\">Donatello</a> managed to narrowly abort the self destruct.</p><h3>Volume 2</h3><p>Years later Stockman managed to break into a DARPA facilty, killing several guards and sealing himself in one of the labs. When security managed to get into the room they found the dead bodies of the guards but also the body of Baxter Stockman that had his head cut open and brain removed. Stockman had transferred his mind into that of a robot and started making its way to New York to exact revenge on the person he blamed for his misfortunes: April O'Neil.</p><p>Reaching the city he managed to track down O'Neil as she was driving to the grocery store and attacked her by bursting out of the street below and ripping her car open. He stabbed her in the shoulder with the tip of a syringe and vows this is only the beginning of the pain he will bring upon her, with that he leaves via the sewers. The turtles and their ally Nobody manage to catch up with Stockman and a massive rooftop battle ensues. Stockman has the upper hand until the battle draws too much attention he chooses to retreat, jumping off the roof and grabbing on to a police helicopter to slow his fall he sustains damage and retreats to the sewers were he blacks out. When he wakes he's shocked to find that the robot body is repairing itself, even growing a new arm to replace the one that was blown off in the fight.</p><p>The turtles and <a href=\"/casey-jones/4005-44890/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44890\">Casey Jones</a> once again track down Stockman in the sewers. Stockman drops a live cable hoping that when it reaches the water it would electrocute his enemies. Quick thinking by <a href=\"/leonardo/4005-44712/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44712\">Leonardo</a> has the Baxter be the one that's electrocuted until he explodes into pieces. The only thing left of Stockman is his glasses which were inside the machine.</p><h3>Volume 4</h3><p>When the <a href=\"/utorms/4060-49937/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49937\">Utroms</a> make first contact with humanity and set up a base in the Atlantic Ocean the turtles arrange for the human friends April, Casey and <a href=\"/shadow/4005-49930/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49930\">Shadow</a> to visit the base. When stepping through the security scanner it detects nanobots in April's body. Under medical examination it is revealed that the nanobots are of Utrom design, the Utroms relate a story that during their first sojourn on Earth they would occasionally hire humans to help with their work though they would not reveal the their true nature to them. One of these humans was Baxter Stockman who stole a batch of nanbots. Obviously not wanted to subject themselves to public scrutiny, they did not pursue him. It is revealed that this is what Stockman had injected her with when he stabbed her shoulder years prior.</p><p>Donatello goes to a secret lab in the sewers were it is revealed that unbeknownst to anyone he had kept what was left of Stockman captive for years. It had been four years, twelve days, six hours and forty-three minutes since they had talked last. When Don responds that he's been busy the Baxterbot taunts him \"probably off battling the Toe Clan...'fight with honor' or some such nonsense.\" He does, however, point out that with years alone in the dark he has thought of new solutions to old problems and even claimed to know how to build a time machine.</p><p>Donatello tries for hours to get Stockman to reveal the purpose of the nanobots and how to remove them but in the end he gives up. The turtle reveals that his brothers would be appalled to know he had kept Stockman alive bu he did so, hoping there was something of value that could be learned from him. However, Donatello admits he knows Stockman is irredeemably evil and should have been eliminated long ago. Taking out a blaster, he fires at Stockman finally putting him out of his misery with the parting words \"Goodbye Baxter. Rot in Hell.\"</p><h2>Baxter Stockman in other media</h2><h3>1987 Animated series</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9245/273243-61495-baxter-stockman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-273243\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2285714285714\" data-width=\"385\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 385px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9245/273243-61495-baxter-stockman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-273243\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9245/273243-61495-baxter-stockman.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9245/273243-61495-baxter-stockman.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" data-width=\"385\"></a></figure><p>Baxter Stockman was a struggling inventor who was unsuccessfully trying to sell his Mouser robots to pest extermination companies but was met with rejection due to the Mouser's being too effective which would eleminate the city's rat problem and would put them out of business. He was approached by the <a href=\"/shredder/4005-42406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42406\">Shredder</a> with an offer to mass produce his Mousers. Unbeknownst to Stockman the ninja planned to use them to hunt down his enemy <a href=\"/master-splinter/4005-42407/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42407\">Splinter</a>. He was hunted down by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles who used Stockman's remote to override the Mouser's when they attacked by the robots. Stockman was blamed for the havoc caused by his creation and arrested. The following episodes had the turtles use Stockman's building as a secondary base. Using Stockman's van and his equipment Donatello made the Turtle Van and later the the Turtle Blimp.</p><p>In the show's second season Baxter is broken out of a mental institution by the Shredder. This time Stockman works with the Shredder with full knowledge of what he's involved in and uses his scientific expertis to aid the ninja, particularly in tracking down the thre fragments of the Eyes of <a href=\"/sarnath/4005-51512/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51512\">Sarnath</a>. Tired of being abused by the Shredder when the three pieces are united he betrays his master and takes the Eyes for himself but is soon put in his place by Saki who manages to take back the Eyes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346549-53975-baxter-stockman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346549\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.748\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346549-53975-baxter-stockman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346549\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346549-53975-baxter-stockman.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346549-53975-baxter-stockman.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a></figure><p>Finaly sick of Baxter's failure the Shredder contacts his alien benefactor <a href=\"/krang/4005-44710/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44710\">Krang</a> to send his two hench mutants <a href=\"/bebop/4005-50049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50049\">Bebop</a> and <a href=\"/rocksteady/4005-50050/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50050\">Rocksteady</a> from Dimension-X. Because of a magnetic storm Bebop and Rocksteady could not be sent thought the dimensional portal without someone being sent back. Shredder throws Stockman through the portal in exchange for the two mutants. With no use for the human scientist Krang has Stockman sent to the Disintegrator Unit to dispose of him, unbeknowst to him a fly got into the unit with him and turned Stockman into a mutant fly. Managing to escape from the Disintegrator and opens a portal and returns to Earth. Stockman tracks down the Shredder to take revenge but in his current state his mind is easily influenced and the ninja convinces him that it's the turtles who are his enemies. Still retaining some of his intelligence, he helped set a trap for the turtles by building a device that would render them out of phase with normal time but in the battle Baxter was caught in the machine himself.</p><p>Stockman spent months out of phase before using a lightning rod to return to normal and sought revenge on both Shredder and the turtles. Shredder was able to sweet talk Stockman once again by promising that he would have Krang return him to normal if they destroyed the turtles together. The partnership fell though after they were defeated by the turtles and Stockman realised Shredder would never hold up his end of the bargain. Once again he left swearing vengeance on the his former master.</p><p>Living in the sewers Stockman came upon an acheological dig. After scaring off the expedition he realised the buried ruins they were researching was actualy an alien ship that had been there for three-hundred years. Stockman befriended the artificial intelligence that ran the ship's computer. Using parts of a pan dimensional warp drive as bait for Shredder. The turtles also got involved and Baxter chose to retreat with the ship but when a piece was missing from the warp drive the ship fell apart in the space between dimenions and Stockman was stuck in limbo.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346558-48434-baxter-stockman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346558\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.78\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346558-48434-baxter-stockman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346558\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346558-48434-baxter-stockman.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346558-48434-baxter-stockman.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346558-48434-baxter-stockman.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/346558-48434-baxter-stockman.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In limbo Stockman would remain friends with what was left of the ship's computer and after a while helped him escape. His time trapped in limbo had obviously taken a toll as his mind had detoriorated even more, he now had to rely heavily on the computer to keep reminding him who his enemies were and why he even wanted revenge on them, he also displayed more fly-like behavior such as being fascinated by bright lights and sugar. He managed to capture the turtles and imprison them in a clock tower. Knowing that Shredder would want to be the one to dispose of the turtles he decided to use them as bait. The plan of course went awry as the turtles escaped. Baxter tried to follow Shredder through the portal to Dimension-X but was cut off half way and was once again trapped in limbo.</p><p>He would return to Earth again without the computer but this time with a new ability to communicate with other flies. He planned to lead an army of them to gain revenge on the Shredder. By this time the Shredder's base the Technodrome was no longer in Dimension-X but rather the Arctic. The cold climate was inhospitable to Stockman and his fly army and so he was easily defeated. Fortunately Krang was intrigued by Stockman's new power and offered Stockman the opportunity to become human again if Stockman and his army would help them take over New York City. Unsuprisingly the plan was thwarted by the the turtles when Donatello used his portable portal to strand the Stockman in another dimension.</p><p>Stockman's final appearance on the show had him once again with the computer with a plan for vengeance against the entire world. Using special mutagen he planned to turn the world into insect mutants. Capturing the turtles, they questioned him as to what exactly they had even done to him to warrent revenge with Baxter admitting he can no longer remember...but they'd pay for it anyway. The turtles used Shredder's retro mutagen ray to turn people back to normal and in the process the computer was destroyed and Stockman was once again stuck in limbo presumebly forever.</p><h3>2003 Animated series</h3><p>The second series portrays Stockman closer to the original Mirage version as an African American ego maniacal scientist. He owns his own company called Stocktronics were he manufactures his Mousers with the intention of stealing from vaults but publicaly claiming his invention is to help with the city's rat problem. Events go similar to that of the comic book in that his lab tech April O'Neil grows suspicious and when finding out the true purpose of his invention tries to escape through the sewers were she is rescued by the turtles. She also returns with them to stop Stockman in the same way as she does in the comics.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33941/806700-stockman1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-806700\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33941/806700-stockman1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-806700\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33941/806700-stockman1.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33941/806700-stockman1.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33941/806700-stockman1.png\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33941/806700-stockman1.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Unlike the comics Stockman isn't merely a solo agent, he was working with the <a href=\"/foot-clan/4060-47999/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47999\">Foot Clan</a> who were financing his invention. After his defeat at the hands of the turtles he worked directly for the Shredder as his chief scientist and built inventions for the Foot to use. After each defeat however he would given \"punishments\" and each time he was seen his physical condition would grow worse. Over the course of the first season he would be shown to lose an eye, a hand and be bound to a wheel chair after presumebly being paralyzed. After the turtles and their allies weres seemingly killed during the Foot's raid on April O'Neil's apartment and the Second Time Around the Shredder demanding proof that they had been killed. His tests however came back inconclusive, rather than being the bearer of bad news and risking one final punishment he faked results which showed the Shredder that his enemies had been destroyed.</p><p>In truth <a href=\"/casey-jones/4005-44890/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44890\">Casey Jones</a> had taken the turtles, Splinter and April to his Grandmother's old Northampton farmhouse to recover. Stockman used this time to build a giant robot exoskeleton to house his body. In the adaption of \"<a href=\"/return-to-new-york/4045-49544/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-49544\">Return to New York</a>\" during the turtles attack on the Foot Head Quarters he made his move by attacking the turtles and the Shredder as revenge for all that had happened to him. He was easily defeated by both and as punishment Shredder stripped him of his physical body and had his head attached to a small spider-like bod, this body also had a chip which would make Stockman follow Shredder's every vocal command.

He is portrayed by Phil LaMaar.</p><p>One of the funny running gags in this show is the Turtles making fun of Baxter as a nontreat. One way they do this is by contantly getting him name wrong calling him things like Dexter Speckman and Boxer Stockboy.</p><p>Eventually like in previous shows he will be transformed into a mutant fly man.  At this point he will become the enemy known as Buzzkill.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Arisa came to BEDLAM all of three years ago - led here uncannily, by her various psychic talents. (She possesses strong telepathic and telekinetic skills and yet undefined level of prescience.) She was initially brought into Red Team as neophyte during the rigorous training each team member undergoes, but soon found herself recruited into Blue Team when need arose for someone with her unique abilities. Unfortunately, her second outing with that team left her, a nineteen year old girl, the sole survivor of a horrific ambush. Terrified, yet determined to fulfill the mission's objective on her own, which she accomplished admirably.</p><div><br/></div><div>She has become a friend and a disciple to Joann DeFile, whose role as a mentor and advisor.</div>",

    "description": "<p>Molly herself takes issue with any such terminology — refusing to even discuss the subject — is only the tip of the iceberg here. She came to us, or rather, was located by a new apparatus developed in the ectolabs of R&amp;D, nearly three years ago. Newly...liberated of her mortal coil, Molly was lost and afraid and, sadly, unaware of her new condition. Contacted and befriended by our resident psychic, Joann DeFile, Molly soon felt herself at home here at BEDLAM and eventually agreed to undergo counseling with Dr. Sheehan (see file: Sheehan, Patricia, MSW, CSW 67/8-10), which greatly helped Molly to deal with her new situation and surroundings.</p><p>Molly is incorporeal — ethereal — and views this as her greatest bane. She longs for the touch of another and yet knows that it can never be. Though generally in high spirits, Molly has been known to fall into brief yet deep depressions regarding her state. It is felt by Dr. Sheehan and others that one of these episodes of despair may actually 'push' Molly into the next phase of her journey.</p><p>It is believed that Molly is more a 'half-ghost', as, while she cannot completely pass into the 'next world', she appears to be rooted here, to this plane of existence, by some lot or some manner of unfinished business. She can regulate her own visibility. She is visited regularly by three familiars through whom she receives much information which has aided her and Blue Team in the field.

    "description": "<p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\">Peter</a> heads over to the shelter to help out <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\" href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" slug=\"aunt-may\">Aunt May</a>. While he's there, the junkie known as Freak steals the donation box. Peter says he'll go after him and then changes into Spider-Man. He gets Freak cornered on a rooftop but the donation box falls. When Spider-Man jumps down to try to gather the money before the crowd grabs it all, a couple of police officers show up. He leaves the money and takes off.</p><p>Freak also managed to take off by pulling himself out of his clothes that were webbed to some pipes. Trying to find his connection's meth lab, he falls through a laboratory's skylight. He figures this is his lucky day when he finds several needles, not seeing the sign that says, \"BIOHAZARD. Property of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1488\" href=\"/lizard/4005-1488/\" slug=\"lizard\">Curt Connors</a>. BHK Stem Cell Project.\" He injects the stem cells, believing them to be drugs.</p><p>Later, Freak is in an alley massively throwing up. Cursing Spider-Man, he is enveloped in his vomit. In the morning at the alley, a strange cocoon is found by a waste management worker, and when he touches it, it burns his fingers. Soon the police and Carlie are there trying to control the crowd and figure out what it is. In Connors' lab, he finds the mess and wonders what happened to his work.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1130757-fr5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1130757\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5117924528302\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1130757-fr5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1130757\"><img alt=\"The Freak comes out!!\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1130757-fr5.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1130757-fr5.jpg 424w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\"></a><figcaption>The Freak comes out!!</figcaption></figure><p>Freak breaks out of the cocoon, surrounded by police officers with Spider-Man looking down. Freak starts moving and an officer with an itchy trigger finger shoots him in the head when he doesn't stop. The shot sends him down into a service tunnel into the sewers. The officers think the problem is over but Freak forms another chrysalis to recover.</p><p>After a little while, Freak wakes up. He has changed again. He now has claws and webbed hands. His senses have increased and he continues to blame Spider-Man. Freak makes his way out of the sewer tunnels. Still hungry, he kills a hot dog vendor and notices the torn pants of Spider-Man. Grabbing it, he realizes that he can now follow his scent.</p><p>Freak ends up following the scent of Spider-Man to Randall Crowne's campaign event where he just goes berserk and causes all sorts of mayhem down at the event. Civilians start running around insanely trying to escape Freak while he calls out Spider-Man who he smells somewhere in the audience. Peter quickly changes into his Spider-Man attire and swings in to stop Freak. During that time, the police shoot at Freak to discover that his evolution made him impervious to bullets, a factor easily visible when Freak exclaims \"HA! IT TICKLES!\".</p><p>Parker swings in and has a satellite dish thrown at him by his newest foe. Freak lashes out and tries to hit Spider-Man but to no avail and picks up a statue and launches it at Crowne after Crowne barks orders at the immensely disfigured being.</p><p>Spider-Man goes just in time to save Freak but is ignored when Freak smells a crack house nearby and rushes off to get the drugs. Freak crawls on the side of the crack house and enters it, his claws open up and he kills the two chemists/makers. He begins to take all the drugs until Spider-Man interrupts him again and the two engage in battle again. Freak gets into a punching bout with Parker until he catches him and prepares to kill him, but before he kills Spider-Man, Spider-Man destroys the crack in the back and sets the entire place on fire. Freak, infuriated by the wall-crawler is caught unaware and Spider-Man escapes Freak's grasp. He battles with Freak again until Freak winds up going into the fire and 'dies'.</p><p>Dr. Connors finds out that his stem cell research was stolen by Freak, and alerts Spider-man. Connors tells him that the only way to take out Freak is to cover him in Quick Lime in order to send him into a permanent cocooned stasis. But, Freak is nowhere to be found but, thanks to the cold weather that falls upon New York, Dr. Connors tells Spider-man that it should take some time before Freak hatches from his cocoon this time, due to the reptile DNA in Freak's blood.</p><p>Connors finds Freak's chrysalis in a junkyard and passes the information onto Spider-man, telling him that he is bringing the quick lime to the junkyard.</p><p>Spider-man rushes to the junkyard after a close call with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50406\" href=\"/menace/4005-50406/\" slug=\"menace\">Menace</a>, and finds that Freak has broken out of his chrysalis and is on the war path, stronger than ever. They tussle for a bit, and Spider-man finally takes him down when he tells Freak that newly-arrived Connors' Quick Lime is actually a batch of drugs. Freak falls for the ruse and breaks open the Quick Lime, inhaling the chemical and promptly falling into unconsciousness.</p><p>Last we see of Freak is a giant pupa being wheeled into a deep freeze owned by Oscorp. The Freak is being held in one of Oscorp's labs and is a test subject for various experiments. The Freak is restrained with various tubes sticking out of his body. Norman Osborn and his scientist are discovering how his body removes a weakness every time they kill him in various ways. The Freak wanted drugs for the pain but his body removed the pleasure center of his brain and cured him of his addiction. Osborn decided to inject a new foreign substance into his body to see how he reacted to it. The Freak's body detected the substance and created a biological counter measure. His body began to produce a poison, a super venom that Osborn planned to use for a later date.</p><p>After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6733\" href=\"/eddie-brock/4005-6733/\" slug=\"eddie-brock\">Anti-Venom</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\" href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" slug=\"venom\">Venom</a>, Spider-Man, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\" href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" slug=\"norman-osborn\">Norman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\" href=\"/harry-osborn/4005-2478/\" slug=\"harry-osborn\">Harry</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\" href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" slug=\"thunderbolts\">Thunderbolts</a>, along with several test subjects escape the crumbling facility, two scientists tell Norman that Freak died in the rubble. Norman reminds them that Freak cannot die.</p><h3>Powers:</h3><p>Freak has the power to evolve every time he is killed by something. He nearly got killed by bullet-shots and fire so now he is evolved to be fire-proof and bullet-proof. He also has superstrength, a healing factor and enchanted smell.</p>",

While conducting a human trafficking run aboard a ship named the Golden Dragon, he panicked and forced the the captain to run into dangerous waters, hitting a sandbar. He could not afford to be caught. He had criminal records in both the United States and China. So what he did was steal the papers from one of the \"piglets\" who died on pneumonia on the voyage. This dead man was one Martin Li. Because he was not one of the half-starved and beaten illegal immigrants being smuggled aboard the ship, he was the only one able to survive the frantic swim to shore.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Returning to his associates to find out why his calls for aid went unanswered, he found it was for good reasons. They were all dead, and he had just walked into the middle of a <a href=\"/maggia/4060-26082/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26082\"> Maggia</a> takeover of the operation. He was taken alive and used for human experimentation of a new drug. These experiments were the same as those that produced <a href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\"> Cloak</a> and <a href=\"/dagger/4005-1935/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1935\"> Dagger</a>. In fact, he escaped along with the two runaways but went his own way after the initial escape. Like them, he had developed powers of his own. Powers he intended to use to get vengeance upon the Maggia organization.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">First, he needed resources and an empire of his own. He became both Mr. Negative and Martin Li, putting his life into a balance of darkness and light. As Mr. Negative, he took over the Chinatown gangs and forged his own criminal empire. As Martin Li, he became a billionaire philanthropist and founded the <a href=\"/feast/4060-56566/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56566\"> F.E.A.S.T.</a> organization to help the homeless.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Mister Negative's first appearance was in the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/free-comic-book-day-2007-spider-man-1-swing-shift/4000-121176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Free Comic Book Day 2007 </a>Spider-Man comic from May 2007.

Since then his popularity has risen and even had his own <a href=\"/dark-reign-mister-negative/4050-26766/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26766\"> mini series</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Brand New Day</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/273850-4762-mister-negative.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/273850-4762-mister-negative.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/273850-4762-mister-negative.jpg\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Later, Mr. Negative acquired a special tablet that contained the formula for a powerful poison called the Devil's Breath. He tricked and kidnapped Bruno Karnelli, a relative of both the Karnelli and Manfreids Maggia families. <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Spider-Man</a> arrived at Mr. Negative's hideout as he was draining Bruno of his blood. Mr. Negative escaped with the poison and attempted to kill the other Maggia families with it. Spider-Man tried to stop him, but was unable to save the Maggia bosses. Spider-Man wasn't affected by the poison because it was DNA specific. A surviving Maggia member told him that their wives and children went to a circus and Spider-Man went there to stop Mister Negative. He was able to stop him from killing the women and children, but Spider-Man was forced to give Mr. Negative a sample of his blood in exchange for a little girl held hostage. Negative threw the girl in the ocean so Spider-Man would save her, allowing him to escape.</p><h3>New ways to Die</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-691740\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8265625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:82.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-691740\"><img alt=\"Facing Anti-Venom\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg 1280w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg 960w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Facing Anti-Venom\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg 1280w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg 960w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/691740-black_from_white.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Facing Anti-Venom</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Mr. Negative came across the former <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\"> Venom</a>, <a href=\"/eddie-brock/4005-6733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6733\"> Eddie Brock</a>. After learning the man's history, Martin Li offers Brock a job at a soup kitchen. Strangely, a single touch cured Eddie of his cancer, but this had the side effect of mutating the remnants of the Venom symbiote in his body. These mutating remnants bonded with Brock's white blood cell, transforming him into a new creature called Anti-Venom. Brock became a committed employee of Li's F.E.A.S.T. organization, taking the most of the second chance Li had given him. However, Brock would also discover the truth about Li and Mr. Negative.</p><h3>Character Assassinations</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Martin Li endorsed <a href=\"/bill-hollister/4005-49967/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49967\"> Bill Hollister</a>, the father of <a href=\"/lily-hollister/4005-49653/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49653\"> Lily Hollister</a>, for mayor of New York City in the upcoming election. This endorsement put him against the new Editor-in-Chief of the <a href=\"/daily-bugle/4060-40822/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40822\"> Daily Bugle</a>, <a href=\"/dexter-bennett/4005-50434/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50434\"> Dexter Bennett</a>, who had thrown his endorsement behind Hollister's rival, <a href=\"/randall-crowne/4005-52524/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52524\"> Randall Crowne</a>. This resulted in a smear campaign being launched against Hollister, as well as Bennett wanting to find dirt on Martin Li. Meanwhile, Mr. Negative recruited <a href=\"/hammerhead/4005-6817/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6817\"> Hammerhead</a> into his organization with offers of an <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\"> adamantium</a> cybernetic body. Apparently, Hammerhead quickly became one of Mr. Negative's most loyal lieutenants.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/1144091-dark_reign_mister_negative_1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/1144091-dark_reign_mister_negative_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/1144091-dark_reign_mister_negative_1.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/1144091-dark_reign_mister_negative_1.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\"> Norman Osborn</a> came to power, this created trouble for Mr. Negative. A new power structure was forming that did not suit his interests. The intent was to fold his criminal enterprises into the <a href=\"/the-hood/4005-41917/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41917\"> Hood</a>'s growing organization, and Mr. Negative would not allow it. A gang war broke out between his <a href=\"/the-inner-demons/4060-56281/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56281\"> Inner Demons</a> and the Hood's <a href=\"/the-hoods-gang/4060-50921/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50921\"> Syndicate</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/betty-brant/4005-2484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2484\"> Betty Brant</a> was working at Dexter Bennett's behest to dig up dirt on Martin Li, and she managed to track down Martin Li's wife. This was the wife of the real Martin Li, who Mr. Negative had made arrangements with to keep the truth quiet. He corrupted <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Spider-Man</a> and sent him after Betty, hoping that would solve the problem.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The gang war quickly came down to being between Mr. Negative and the Hood personally. The two fought, and Mr. Negative found that the Hood was already too corrupted for his touch to affect. When it looked like Mr. Negative was at the Hood's mercy, Osborn called everything off. A gamble of Mr. Negative's had paid off, and he had evidence of some of Osborn's dealings to use as leverage. This was thanks to the <a href=\"/spot/4005-18270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18270\"> Spot</a>, who was secretly loyal to Mr. Negative.</p><h3><b>The Gaunlet</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24872/1126403-spidey_and_inner_demons.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1126403\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.37701149425287\" data-width=\"435\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 435px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:37.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24872/1126403-spidey_and_inner_demons.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1126403\"><img alt=\"Spider-man Confronting Mr. Negative\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" data-width=\"435\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24872/1126403-spidey_and_inner_demons.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24872/1126403-spidey_and_inner_demons.jpg 435w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man Confronting Mr. Negative\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24872/1126403-spidey_and_inner_demons.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24872/1126403-spidey_and_inner_demons.jpg 435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" data-width=\"435\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-man Confronting Mr. Negative</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He attempts to get rid of Mr. Negative so he will not ruin his plains and lures him to an opera house holding their funds. Spider-man discovered the plain before Negative and arrived to battle Mysterio. Mr. Negative attempted to use his Devil's Breath keyed to Spider-man's DNA to finish him off but he was able to escape the poisoned cloud. Mysterio caused a robotic duplicate of <a href=\"/silvermane/4005-13846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13846\"> Silvermane</a> to explode hoping to kill Mr. Negative but he and his men survived. Unable to handle the fact that Negative could kill him with his Devil's Breath Spider-man called up Black Cat to help him steal the vial of blood that he needs to make it work on him. They are successful and replace his blood with pigs blood.</p><h3>Shadowland</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the events of Shadowland, in which Daredevil took control of hell's kitchen and unleashed the Hand on it's inhabitants, Mr. Negative took advantage of the madness to expand his empire. He and his inner demons faced off against a group of Hand ninjas until Spider-Man &amp; martial artist Shang-Chi intervene. The Inner Demons take advantage of Mr. Negative's temporary distraction and flee. A furious battle ensues, ending with Mr. Negatice using his powers to convert Shang-Chi to his cause. But then, something unexpected happens. Though converted, Shang-Chi still possesses his own will, as well as a portion of Negative's power &amp; control over his Inner Demons. Unable to defeat him and confused about what happened, Mr. Negative escapes the powered up Shang-Chi and Spider-Man manages to free him from Negative's power. It is then revealed that Mr. Negative cannot change from Martin Li and himself at will, and it either happens at random or at a certain time.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295876\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.50340798442064\" data-width=\"1027\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1027px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295876\"><img alt=\"Healing powers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg 1027w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Healing powers\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg 1027w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1295876-mr._negative___eddie_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Healing powers</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Mister Negative can control some type of black electrical energy resembling a photographic negative. He uses this energy to change from Martin Li into Mister Negative, and can charge his dagger with it. Recently, it was revealed he has no control over when the change occurs. He also has some undefined level of super strength but he has been shown to lift chunks of debris and send Spider-man flying through a few small buildings. He also has powers that can manipulate the biology of a living creature, evidence by the healing of Eddie Brock's cancer and changing the remaining symbiote to combine with Brock's white blood cells, turning him into Anti-Venom.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Appearances In Other Media</h2><h3>The Amazing Spider-Man (2012-Video Game)</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the video game epilogue to The Amazing Spider-Man film, Mister Negative has been referenced in one of the locations you have to take some pictures for Whitney Chang. Various references can be seen, such as a bench and a telephone booth with negative colored effects, including a quote on a building wall saying, \"I was never born, so I am ever living\". In fact, the location is said to be a FEAST shelter.</p>",

Fortunately for her she has a brother (<a href=\"/charlie-kopetski/4040-54273/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-54273\">Charlie Kopetski</a>) that is willing to help her.</p><p>Charlie is blind but he is still a mechanical genius. He helps his sister with her adventures by inventing most of her weapons. Barb Wire turns to her brother for help whenever she needs a new weapon. One trait Barb Wire keeps telling people is \"don't call me Babe\" The reason for this is that she did not want to be compared to another hero called Babe.</p><p>As a bounty hunter Barb Wire has chased many bounty's in Steel Harbor as well as <a href=\"/arcadia/4020-56181/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56181\">Arcadia</a>. In Arcadia she came in contact with the \"Woman in White\" the Ghost. She and the Ghost became friends but they do have their moments of conflict. Barb is not much for fighting the supernatural.

He was moved to an old barn along with two officers who were safeguarding him. The two officers were <a data-ref-id=\"4005-18318\" href=\"/sara-pezzini/4005-18318/\">Sara Pezzini</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43914\" href=\"/detective-gleason/4005-43914/\">Patrick Gleason</a>. Pezzini used her weapon called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-18319\" href=\"/witchblade/4005-18319/\">Witchblade</a> to fight the hijacker, but when Brunt set himself free and was about to kill Pezzini, the hijacker shot him into back of his head.

They went to a nearby diner and waited until they had 13 innocents to sacrifice. They executed them and took them to a nearby hill where they painted a mystical emblem on the ground and burned the bodies, completing an opening spell that released <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46531\" href=\"/urizen/4005-46531/\" slug=\"urizen\">Urizen</a> from his banishment and allowed him to return through the smoke.

As The Kingdom set out on its murderous rampage Spawn had tried to stop them and used Ab and Zab to force the decapitated head of the vampire Wolfram to reveal The Kingdoms plans. Knowing their plans Spawn ordered Ab and Zab to build a portal to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\" href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" slug=\"hell\">Hell</a> that would suck in the vampires. However after the vampires were forced into Hell an old enemy returned through the portal..... the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3390\" href=\"/violator/4005-3390/\" slug=\"violator\">Violator</a>!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Brad 'Chicken Heart' Vickers served as S.T.A.R.S alpha team's dedicated pilot from the foundation of the team in 1996 and onwards until his death during the Raccoon city outbreak. Overly skittish and inexperienced in field combat, Vickers' nerves got the better of him during the Mansion incident and he abandoned his teammates in the Arklay forest. However, he later had a change of heart and returned to rescue the remaining survivors from the mansion prior to self-destruct, providing the survivors with a rocket launcher in the process. Following the incident Vickers remained in Raccoon city for unknown reasons and he was later caught in the T-Virus outbreak that ravaged the city. Having fled the police department, Brad was later found by his teammate jill valentine, though the S.T.A.R.S officer was largely incomprehensible due to his rambling. Vickers was later found outside the police station, though he was almost immediately killed by Nemesis. He was later found in a zombified state by the protagonists of RE2.</p>",

Jill has a long and impressive history as members of various peacekeeping, military and defense forces and organizations. Jill's first foray into this lifestyle was with the U.S. Army's Delta Force.</p><p>Jill's impressive fighting abilities and bomb defusing expertise granted her a spot into <a href=\"/stars/4060-54091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54091\">S.T.A.R.S</a> unit. Its Alpha team. As far as her family lineage, it is believed that she is the daughter of a famous mobster, her father also French in nationality and her mother being of Japanese descent and also known as Nikkei, making Jill half french and half Japanese.</p><p>Jill has been a part of several notorious incidents involving bioterrorism and the pharmaceutical corporation <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/umbrella-corp/4060-54134/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54134\">Umbrella Inc.</a> The first of which is known as the Mansion Incident, in which her team S.T.A.R.S Alpha squad and associated team S.T.A.R.S Bravo squad were forced to fight against crazed zombie like creatures in a mansion in the Arkley mountain range.

Both incidents involved the Umbrella Corporation and former S.T.A.R.S team member <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wesker/4005-50017/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50017\">Albert Wesker.</a> Some years after those incidents Jill and Chris would form the BSAA to dedicate their lives to stopping the looming threats of bioterrorism.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Jill Valentine first appeared in the Playstation video game Resident Evil (known as \"Biohazard\" in Japan) developed and published by Capcom. The character of Jill owing her creation to numbers Capcom employees, most notably Takahiro Arimitsu, with character designs by Isao Ohishi and motion capture and modeling by Jun Takeuchi. Jill would feature as one of the stars and main protagonists of the first game in the franchise, the first of many. Released in 1996 the game would become instantly popular in Japan and North America before becoming a hit around the world, ensuring future sequels.</p><p>Jill being the primary female protagonist was created specifically to be physically smaller and weaker than her partner <a href=\"/chris-redfield/4005-50016/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50016\"> Chris Redfield</a>, but this is compensated by giving her more ammunition, combat slots, and also the ability to pick locks, a trait which the character becomes well known for.</p><p>Eventually the character of Jill Valentine would be adapted into different media as the Resident Evil franchise grew to include movies, novels and comic books and graphic novels. Jill, alongside many of the iconic Resident Evil characters, would appear in the comic series Resident Evil published by Image comics. Jill's first appearance was in Resident Evil #1 - S.T.A.R.S. Files which was released in 1998.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3544357\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3544357-jjjhtrsllll.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4405850091408\" data-width=\"547\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 547px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3544357-jjjhtrsllll.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3544357\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55328/3544357-jjjhtrsllll.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3544357-jjjhtrsllll.jpg 547w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55328/3544357-jjjhtrsllll.jpg 444w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-width=\"444\"></a></figure><p>Jill Valentine is one of the most popular and referenced female protagonists not just in the Resident Evil franchise, but video games in general, with the character even making inroads into other mediums, and appearing in many other media formats. Originally from humble beginnings in the original survival horror video game Resident Evil, Jill was one of only two main playable characters that began the franchise.</p><p>Although her character was somewhat generic the priority of such video games being plot and action orientated, with popular sequels her character and backstory was fleshed out to create a more rounded out character with her own set of ideals, motivations and connections with other characters. Comparisons with Tomb Raider star Lara Croft have been made, with both heroines respectively starring in two of the Playstation's most profitable and highest selling game franchises.</p><p>Jill's popularity and strong association to the entire franchise of Resident Evil ensuring her appearing frequently with anything to do with Resident Evil. Sienna Guillory would portray the character in the franchises live action film pieces. Currently Jill Valentine's likeness is borrowed from Canadian model and actress Julia Voth. The events of Resident Evil 5 would trigger a substantial change in Jill's character, after a near death experience and several years missing she has enhanced physical abilities and a new blonde look. Amusingly, due to translation issues with the original video game, Jill has become the star of several online memes poking fun at some of the corny dialogue directed at her by the Barry Burton character. Namely the 'master of unlocking' and the 'Jill sandwich' references.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Mansion Incident</h3><p>In the year of 1998, Jill and her fellow S.T.A.R.S Alpha team were sent on a mission to rescue the S.T.A.R.S Bravo team, whose helicopter had malfunctioned and crashed in the mountains of Raccoon city. In the search for Bravo team's helicopter they were attacked by mutant dogs and forced to flee into a nearby mansion. They would learn the Mansion was also interconnected with a research facility that they would later know as the Arkley Research Facility.</p><p>Jill and Chris would be separated at first and work independently of each other learning shocking truths about the cause and catalysts behind the several incidents plaguing them teams. Together they would become aware of Umbrellas involvement, the blackmailing of team mate and friend Barry Burton, the involvement and betrayal of Albert Wesker, their team leader and the forced execution of some of their team mates by Wesker's hands.</p><p>They would also be attacked by various mutated creatures ranging from giant snakes, zombified crows and strange reptilian hunter creatures. Also, during the search through the monster-infested mansion she and the other members discovered that it was the work of an experimental virus made by <a href=\"/umbrella-corp/4060-54134/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54134\">Umbrella</a> Inc. called the <a href=\"/t-virus/4055-55351/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55351\">T-Virus</a>. After defeating a dangerous prototype bio organic weapon known as 'Tyrant' the survivors would escape in a helicopter.</p><h3>City of the Dead</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3544358\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3544358-jjjjiiij.png\" data-ratio=\"1.5139573070608\" data-width=\"609\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 609px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3544358-jjjjiiij.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3544358\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55328/3544358-jjjjiiij.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3544358-jjjjiiij.png 609w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55328/3544358-jjjjiiij.png 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55328/3544358-jjjjiiij.png\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3544358-jjjjiiij.png 609w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55328/3544358-jjjjiiij.png 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Months had passed since the mansion incident. Chris and the other <a href=\"/stars/4060-54091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54091\">S.T.A.R.S</a> members were missing and Jill was the only one left in <a href=\"/raccoon-city/4020-54094/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54094\">Raccoon City</a>. The T-Virus outbreak at the Spencer mansion had spread via infected rats. Soon the citizens of Raccoon City became infected and a full scale biological outbreak developed. Trying to escape her neighborhood she encounters Brad, her fellow S.T.A.R.S member, being attacked by a <a href=\"/zombies/4015-55691/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55691\">zombie</a>.</p><p>After that she arrives at the RPD where she once again finds Brad and has her first encounter with the hulking creature known as Nemesis. After meeting Carlos and Nicolai they team up to find a way out through the clock tower to call a chopper, Nemesis shoots it down only moments later. After that Jill gets infected by the T-Virus and Carlos has to find a vaccine in Raccoon Hospital. After finding the cure Jill and Carlos try to find a way out through a nearby factory.</p><p>While venturing through a park, Jill finds documents revealing that the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (which both Carlos and Nicolai were members of) had been sent as guinea pigs to be test subjects for the <a href=\"/bio-organic-weapon/4015-55770/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55770\">BOW</a>'s (Bio-Organic-Weapons).</p><p>After arriving at the factory Carlos tells Jill that they are going to neutralize the virus by destroying Raccoon City with a nuclear blast, running against time Jill finds a way out via radio broadcast transmission, however, before she can board the chopper she is attacked once again by Nemesis whom she has to defeat in order to escape. After killing the monster, she ventures outside were she finds out that it was Barry broadcasting the signal. After narrowly escaping with Carlos and Barry she continued her quest to destroy Umbrella, but first she has to find Chris Redfield.</p><h3>Queen Zenobia Incident</h3><p>Jill and Chris, having devoted their lives to fighting bioterrorism, would found and create the BSAA. The BSAA or Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance. Operating under the UN, the establishment of this group/organization allowing Jill, Chris and others to better face down the rapidly increasing rates of bioterrorism incidents occurring around the globe. Shortly after the BSAA was formed Jill and Chris would face a challenge in trying to take down Il Veltro, a new bioterrorist group.</p><p>Jill has a new partner, Parker Luciani and the two BSAA agents track down a ship known as the SS Queen Zenobia to locate Chris and his new partner Jessica Sherawat. However, this turns out to be a ruse of sorts as Jill and Parker are captured. They would escape however and would be joined by Chris and Jessica confronting Veltro operatives and learning about the ships connections to Terragrigia. Jill and Chris eventually reunite and defeat the head of Veltro.</p><h3>Spencer Estate and Kijuju Incident</h3><p>After defeating Veltro, Jill and Chris would attempt to arrest the head of Umbrella Ozwell Spencer. Whilst investigating his estate the agents would encounter Wesker, who just murdered Spencer himself. A fight would ensue with the physically enhanced Wesker managing to toy with both BSAA agents. Before landing a killing blow on Chris, Wesker would find himself interrupted and forced through a window into a steep drop off of a cliff by Jill.</p><p>Sacrificing herself to save Chris and defeat Wesker, Jill would presumably fall to her death. The BSAA would search for the remains of both Jill and Wesker but neither were discovered. Despite being declared officially dead, Jill's friend and former partner Chris Redfield is staggered to learn that Jill may very well be alive still during a mission in Africa with his new BSAA partner Sheva Alomar.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Jill Valentine is a trained and skilled soldier and fighter. She has served in the USA army under their Delta Force trained program, and as a S.T.A.R.S agent and BSAA agent (having founded the latter).

Jill has chemistry knowledge. Jill Valentine is also a great hand to hand combatant.</p><p>After the incident involving Wesker at the Spencer estate and her capture and cryogenic slumber, Jill's abilities were enhanced after exposure to the P30 chemical. Her strength and speed were increased, and her already impressive fight skills were improved to such an extent that she could easily overpower even much larger opponents including even Chris.

At the age of 21, Chris had already received high praise as both a pilot and a very capable weapons handler, skilled in both armed and unarmed combat.</p><p>However, despite his impressive skills, Chris was discharged from his unit due to several confrontations and disagreements with his commanding officers. He was soon offered a job as a member of S.T.A.R.S, quickly rising through the ranks being elevated to Alpha Team, and is given the position of PM (Point Man) he was the number one marksman on the team.

Chris was created in the \"Blunt, tough-guy type\" architect, which had become increasing popular during the time.

In the video game Resident Evil 5, Chris has a far more muscular bulid compared to previous games, and has been portrayed by several different voice actors over the character history, they include Scott McCulloch (Resident Evil 1996 and Code: Veronica 2000). Joe Whyte takes over voice acting dutys on the Resident Evil remake in 2002, and then Roger Craig Smith brings the character to life in Resident Evil 5 released in 2009 on the PS3, Xbox 360, and PC.

Suspecting a potential engine failure, Alpha Team, consisting of Albert Wesker, Barry Burton, Jill Valentine, Brad Vickers, Joseph Frost, and Chris Redfield</p><p>serving as the team's Point Man, quickly assemble and are in the air within minutes, heading to Bravo Teams last known coordinates. Conducting an aerial sweep, the team soon see's black smoke and find bravo teams downed helicopter, hoever, to their horror they also discover the mutilated body of bravo teams pilot. While searching the surrounding woods, Joseph Frost is attacked by a pack of wild dogs, who's bodys seemed to be in the process of rotting, despite Jill's efforts, Joseph is torn apart before her and the Dogs soon turn on her.</p><p>Managing to rejoin the rest of the team, Jill and the others run back to their helicopter only to see their terrified pilot Brad Vickers already taking off and leaving them stranded. Remembering the lay out of the land, Wesker ordered them to head for the old spencer mansion, which had been abandoned for years. Just managing to hold of the chasing demonic dogs long enough to reach the mansion they were able to taking shelter inside, only to discover the eerie mansion did not seem to be abandoned at all, in fact the interior seemed to be well cared for, with only a weeks worth of dust on the furniture, where as the mansion had supposed to have been derelict for over 10 years.</p><h3>Post-mansion</h3><p>After recovering from their wounds, the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members made a number of attempts to report Umbrella to the authorities, but all attempts failed due to the corporation's bribing of the Raccoon City Police Department's chief Brian Irons. While the public were disturbed by the events, they continued to purchase Umbrella's products. Eventually, due to the threat of exposure, Irons had the S.T.A.R.S. team disbanded before they discovered too much, and replaced with a more standard S.W.A.T.</p><p>Chris decided to dig up some information on Irons secretly, and requested that the Federal Police Headquarters carry out an investigation into the Raccoon City Police Department and Irons himself. To cover his tracks and keep Irons from suspecting anything, Chris displayed extensive aggressiveness, once punching fellow officer Elrand in the face for spilling coffee on him by accident. Jill, unaware of Chris's intentions, tried to stop him but he simply winked at her then walked away. He was later suspended for \"vacation\".</p><p>Chris began investigating Umbrella alone, telling nobody, not even Jill. When he finally did tell her after inviting her to his apartment and showed her reports on the G-virus, she was determined not to let Chris fight Umbrella on his own, and called Barry for extra backup. The three of them set out to uncover as much info on Umbrella as they could, but Chris knew that their best bet was to travel to Umbrella's main headquarters, in Europe. Jill agreed that she will continue trying to find more information in Raccoon City before joining Chris, and Barry promised to follow after getting his family to safety. Chris opted against telling his sister anything to avoid putting her in harms way, but this decision had the opposite effect.</p><p>Claire, during the <a href=\"http://residentevil.wikia.com/Raccoon_City_Destruction_Incident\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raccoon City Destruction Incident</a> would find the fax reply to Chris's requested investigation of Irons. She had come looking for her brother whose last known whereabouts were in Raccoon City. The fax would reveal that, although they tried to find incriminating evidence regarding the G-virus, no evidence confirmed it's existence. However, they <i>did</i> find that chief Irons was hiding a dark past and may or may not be taking bribes.</p><p>Claire determined that Umbrella had a facility in Paris, and believed Chris may have gone there. Claire indeed traveled to the Paris facility, but found that it was not Chris' destination. She was discovered snooping around, and after almost destroying their own base trying to catch her, Umbrella caught and sent her to Rockfort Island, an isolated prison run by Umbrella.</p><h3>Rockfort Island and Antarctica</h3><p>While in Europe investigating Umbrella's activities, Chris' own activities made him a wanted target for Umbrella.</p><p>This is what helped <a href=\"/leon-s-kennedy/4005-55353/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55353\">Leon S. Kennedy</a> in tracking him down. Leon, a friend of Claire's after they cooperated to escape Raccoon City, was e-mailed by Claire asking him to find Chris. He passed on Claire's message for help, prompting Chris to abandon his mission and head to Rockfort Island.</p><p>Arriving at Rockfort Island, Chris infiltrates undetected by climbing the outer walls. He meets Rodrigo Juan Raval, who tells Chris about Claire's presence on the island. Rodrigo is soon attacked and swallowed by the Gulp Worm, a large worm creature. Chris fights and kills the monster, who spits Rodrigo back out. Before he dies, Rodrigo gives Chris a lighter, which Claire had given him in gratitude for releasing her and tells Chris that Claire may already have left Rockfort Island.</p><p>While searching the island, Chris finds the answers that he was originally looking for when he came to Europe. What he hadn't anticipated however was the return of his former captain. Albert Wesker had mysteriously survived their encounter in the Arklay mountains during the Mansion Incident several months ago and now carries a strong vendetta against Chris.</p><p>They have a brief scuffle, in which Wesker easily overpowers Chris using his inhuman strength, Wesker reveals to Chris that Claire is in Antarctica, at another secret Umbrella research base.</p><p>After following Claire to the Antarctic base, he found her unconscious in a replica of Spencer's Mansion. Wesker himself traveled to the base in pursuit of Alexia Ashford, who possessed the last remaining sample of the t-Veronica virus. Chris and Claire's reunion was brief, as they were separated when Claire departed to find fellow prisoner, Steve Burnside, who she had been cooperating with.</p><p>Chris watched Wesker and a mutated Alexia fight after he demanded she hand over the Veronica virus, but was forced to deal with her himself when Wesker fled the scene. Chris brought her down temporarily.</p><p>After Steve's death, Chris activated the self-destruct system of the base and meets his sister once again. They attempt to escape, but Alexia reappears and tries to stop them. Chris and Claire activate a special weapon, known as the Linear Launcher, but the weapon needs time to charge. Chris tells Claire to wait for him at the Harrier jet while he deals with Alexia. Claire reluctantly agrees, but Alexia tries to attack her. Chris shoots Alexia. Then, her body reacts with a gruesome mutation. Claire runs away, and Chris battles Alexia. During the fight, Alexia leaves her cocoon body and begins to fly. The Linear Launcher finally recharges and, with only one shot, Chris was able to finish her off.</p><p>When the base began to crumble, Chris chases after Wesker, who had taken Claire hostage. After some talk, Wesker releases Claire, claiming that it is Chris he wants, and that killing him is better than completing his mission of acquiring the t-Veronica virus. Chris orders Claire to wait at the jet. Chris and Wesker then engage in combat, and Chris is beaten up by Wesker, who proclaims that his new superhuman abilities are well worth not being human any more.</p><p>Chris utilizes some hanging girders which fall on Wesker. The fight was eventually interrupted by the imminent destruction of the facility. Wesker promises that the next time they meet, it will be the last. Chris leaves for the jet. With the base literally exploding behind him, he emerges from the elevator and is blown across the room, landing on the nose of the jet. Chris piloted the jet and escaped the facility as it self-destructed. Claire asked him to promise he won't go off and leave her alone again, but Chris said that he had to put a stop to Umbrella for good.</p><p>After this incident, Chris is reunited with Jill, who had previously escaped Raccoon City with Barry Burton. She had arrived at Chris' ransacked apartment and found only his knife on the floor. Jill set off to find Chris, who also took action to find her. Together they joined an anti-Umbrella and bio-weapon task-force. They designated themselves partners, working only with each other, and for the next five years, they did everything they could to try and expose Umbrella, but always wound up at a dead end.</p><h3>The end of Umbrella</h3><p>Eventually, they were confronted with a new experimental Bio-Weapon, codenamed <a href=\"http://residentevil.wikia.com/T-A.L.O.S.\" rel=\"nofollow\">t-A.L.O.S.</a> <a href=\"http://residentevil.wikia.com/Sergei_Vladimir\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sergei Vladimir</a> revealed himself to be the creator, and sealed Chris and Jill inside the t-A.L.O.S. containment room and activated the monster. Sergei taunted them, announcing that as fellow soldiers, Chris and Jill know the feeling of being alive in battle, before revealing t-A.L.O.S. as if to say no amount of battle experience is enough to defeat this new B.O.W..</p><p>Having no choice but to fight, Chris and Jill were successfully able to defeat t-A.L.O.S., finally ending Umbrella once and for all. After escaping the facility, Chris and Jill still lamented that Wesker was still out there. Though their troubles with Umbrella were over, it would only be a matter of time before they would be dealing with Wesker again. Unknown to them, Wesker had actually infiltrated the same facility in order to take out Sergei Vladimir.</p><p>After the collapse of Umbrella, rivals and terrorist groups managed to get their hands on Umbrella's projects. Chris and Jill both helped co-found the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (B.S.A.A.), dedicating to stopping the creation and usage of bio-weapons. There, they appointed themselves partners, and aside from locating Wesker, Chris and Jill traveled the world together on missions to reduce the growing number of bio-weapons, ranging from stopping bio-weapons in Asia to destroying bio-weapon labs in South America to arresting smugglers in Europe.</p><h3>Il Veltro Conspiracy</h3><p>In the meantime, Jill Valentine and Parker Luciani launched a rescue mission to the Mediterranean Sea to locate them. According with the last know coordinates issued by terminals, Jill and Parker learned that Chris and Jessica were somewhere in the ocean, possibly aboard on a ship. This leads Parker and Jill to a investigation on <a href=\"http://residentevil.wikia.com/Queen_Zenobia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Queen Zenobia</a>.</p><p>Arriving in the peak of the mountain, Chris and Jessica witnessed a terrible accident involving a cargo plane that crashed nearby. Searching the crash site, they found traces of a virus along with the mauled corpse of the pilot, who was suspected to be a Veltro operative. Following a path, Chris and Jessica rushed through an mining area, a shortcut to the hideout. While in the caves, they were attacked by several mutant wolves infected with the t-Abyss virus, then still unknown. During the combat, Chris was injured in the leg, but was able to defeat the wolf pack of Fenrir with assistance from Jessica who helped him up. By the end of the caves, Chris and Jessica finally discover an air base used by Il Veltro as a hideout. Soon after this, O'Brian finally managed to contact his agents after the communication problem, being informed that the Il Veltro's is active once again. Chris and Jessica also receives bad news: Jill and Parker has gone missing during the last operation to find them. Based on the Veltro's resurrection, it was possible that Parker and Jill were captured by these terrorists. Immediately, Chris and Jessica returned to HQ, taking a chopper and setting another mission to find the Veltro's ghost ship. However, there was no further information about the cruise current location.</p><p>Under Chris' suggestion, O'Brian sends operatives Keith Lumley and Quint Cetcham back to Valkoinen Mökki airport in order to find any data that should give the B.S.A.A. the exact coordinates of Queen Zenobia. This mission was accomplished, allowing Chris and Jessica to locate the cruise. Landing on the ship's deck, Chris and Jessica begins the search for their lost comrades, encountering hordes of mutants. However, they soon realize that this ship is actually the Queen Semiramis, a carbon-copy of Queen Zenobia. Revealing this mistake to O'Brian, Chris get the actual location of Queen Zenobia. While approaching the Queen Zenobia in a boat, Chris and Jessica are attacked by an unknown sea monster, but they manage to frighten him off and ensure their entrance on the ship. Parker and Jill are finally encountered in the ship's Casino, where Jessica shoot a unarmed Veltro agent, much to Chris' surprise. The terrorist is killed, being revealed that he was in fact Raymond Vester, an F.B.C. operative. After this, Chris partnered up with Jill again, heading to the ship's lab in order to stop the t-Abyss virus before this contaminate the sea, while Parker and Jessica searches for a way to delay the Queen Zenobia sinking.</p><p>Once in the labs, Chris and Jill managed to neutralize the t-Abyss virus once and for all, while they actions are monitored by Morgan Lansdale, the mastermind behind the Terragrigia Panic. While escaping the sinking ship, Jill and Chris found a wounded Parker (shot in the leg by Jessica, Morgan's mole). However, they where unable to save him on time, although Parker managed to survive. Outside of the Queen Zenobia, they are attacked by a giant B.O.W. but they manage to destroy it with the help of Kirk Mathison.</p><p>However, the mission was not over yet. Director O'Brian come clean with Jill and Chris, telling all about the Veltro conspiracy orchestrated by himself. Also, he confirms the existence of a third ship: The Queen Dido. In order to retrieve a video that contain the proof of Morgan evil doing, Chris and Jill read for the Dido's remains on the Terragrigia ruins, discovering that Jack Norman is still alive inside the wreckage. Filled with vengeance against Morgan, Norman injected himself with the t-Abyss, becoming the powerful \"Ultimate Abyss\". During the fight, Chris and Jill are able to destroy the creature, retrieving Jack's PDA and revealing the truth about Terragrigia, causing Morgan's arrest and the decline of F.B.C..</p><h3>Jill's apparent death</h3><p>Entering the estate, it was not long before they discovered the bodies of Spencer's bodyguards, who had already been brutally killed through \"unconventional means\". Both of them had to survive and endure numerous puzzles and traps built on the estate, whilst fighting off the multiple Guardians of Insanity which relentlessly pursued them throughout their mission. Whilst proceeding through the estate's gardens, they fell through an old bridge and landed in the sewers below, losing most of their equipment in the process. Defenseless, the agents relied solely on their wits to outsmart and eliminate the remaining Guardians of Insanity before making their escape from the sewer. When they arrived at the last hallway in the estate, they discovered more of his bodyguards horrifically murdered outside the entrance. When they opened the last door where Spencer could be hiding, they were greeted by Wesker, who had just killed Spencer a few minutes before they came in. A brief battle soon followed. Although the two put up a fight, both Chris and Jill were easily beaten by Wesker's super-human powers, and just as Wesker was about to deal the blow that would end Chris' life, Jill launched herself at Wesker, hurling the pair through the nearby window and into the chasm beyond the cliff the mansion was built upon. Chris could do nothing as he watched his partner fall to her death.</p><p>The B.S.A.A. conducted a three month search for Jill's body, with no success. As a result, Jill Valentine was officially declared dead in the line of duty. For the next 3 years, Chris refused to believe that Jill had died, and put himself into every mission available, with the hope of finding some kind of lead to Jill's whereabouts.</p><h3>Kijuju incident</h3><p>Irving tries to kill Chris, Sheva and Josh by blowing the oil refinery, but the B.S.A.A. agents manages to escape and confront Irving. In an ultimate effort to destroy Chris and Sheva, Irving inject himself with a sample containing the Dominant-strain Plaga, who mutates Irving into a large Kraken like creature. Chris and Sheva are able to destroy the monster. Before his death, Irving told Chris that all answers he is looking for will be in the caves.</p><p>With Irving eventually taken down, Chris told Sheva that he only got involved in the mission so he could find Jill, who he suspected was still alive. Although surprised, Sheva vows to stick with Chris to the end. The duo discover a large area full of capsules used to store test subjects. Chris rushes to a monitor and searches for Jill. As the platform they stood on raises to Jill's capsule, Chris and Sheva are attacked by a large creature known as U-8. This promptly stops the platform, forcing Chris and Sheva to fight back.</p><p>After its defeat, both are greeted to an empty capsule, and Excella Gionne via the monitor, who denies any knowledge of Jill. Sheva recognizes Excella as one of TriCell's co-founders, and tells Chris she is lying. Later, they meet Excella again in a lab, where they came across a test subject, who then mutates into Uroboros Mkono. After defeating the monstrosity that resulted, they eventually tracked down Excella, who was accompanied by Albert Wesker, and a mysterious cloaked female acquaintance. Chris demanded to know the whereabouts of Jill, and is stunned when Wesker removed the hood of his mysterious helper, who was none other than Jill herself. Despite Chris' attempts to bring her back to realization, he and Sheva are attacked and overwhelmed by her.</p><p>As Wesker prepares to leave, Chris managed to get through to Jill. Wesker, although surprised, activates a device that causes her extreme pain, and leaves Chris to watch her suffer. Sheva spotted a device on Jill's chest and helped Chris in forcefully removing it.</p><p>After Jill collapses, Chris rushes over to her and is relieved to find that she is alive and back to her senses. She apologizes for her actions and urges Chris to continue and stop Wesker before he can finish his preparations. Chris initially refuses, more concerned on getting Jill to safety. Jill grabs him and tells him that he is the only one capable of stopping Wesker. Chris backs into the elevator, and Jill tells Sheva to look out for him.</p><p>The pair find Excella, and she runs off in a panic, dropping a vial of something which Sheva keeps after Chris explains that it may be important if Excella wanted to guard it so badly. Later it soon becomes clear that Wesker has no loyalty to Excella when she is revealed to have been injected with the Uroboros virus, which consumes her. It attacks the two, though they are eventually able to defeat it, turning their sights to Wesker. It is then that Chris receives a call from Jill who explains that Wesker needs to inject himself with a serum to keep the virus inside of him stable, but overdosing it would weaken him. It is then that the two find out the vial Excella had dropped is the serum they need to inject Wesker with.</p><p>After a very one sided battle with him, Chris and Sheva manage to take control briefly and inject the serum into Wesker's chest, causing him to flee onto his airship with Chris and Sheva in hot pursuit. They manage to take advantage of his weakness and send him flying out of the cargo room but their advantage decreases when he grabs Sheva's leg in an attempt to take them down with him. Chris watches, images of Jill rush through his mind as he remembers how he thought he had lost her trying to kill Wesker. He jumps to grab Sheva as she loses her grip, with Wesker determined to take both of them, but Sheva shoots him in the face and he is sucked from the plane.</p><p>Crashing in a volcano, Chris and Sheva are shocked to find Wesker alive and angry. Puncturing a container of Uroboros, Wesker begins to mutate with it and attacks Chris and Sheva. They retreat, but the rocks they cross over break and they are separated. Sheva shouts to Chris to get higher so she can attack Wesker, who turns his attention towards her. Stranded, she shouted for help and Chris was forced to push a huge boulder out of the way so Sheva could join him. Wesker follows but Chris and Sheva are able to overpower him, and as Wesker stands injured, the ground beneath him begins to break and he slips into the lava.</p><p>Jill and Josh arrive in a helicopter just in time to witness the scene and Jill throws down a rope ladder. Chris grabs it and Sheva starts to climb, but as Chris goes for it, the ground beneath him also breaks. He stumbles, and jumps for the ladder, catching it one handed. Sheva and Chris are helped into the helicopter only for Wesker to emerge from the lava and catch one of his tentacles onto the helicopter skids. Jill points to the two RPG-7's that were in the chopper. Chris and Sheva both take aim and fire, and Wesker is finally killed.</p><p>As they fly away, a voiceover of Chris says while looking at Jill and Sheva: \"More and more I find myself wondering if it's all worth fighting for. For a future without fear? Yeah, it's worth it.\"</p><h3>Eastern Europe</h3><p>Six months before the Lanshiang outbreak, Chris and several B.S.A.A. units were dispatched into a Eastern Europe where an outbreak was caused by an unknown individual, thus events caused Chris some \"personal trauma\".</p><h3>Lanshiang, China</h3><p>Four years after Wesker's demise, Chris leads a B.S.A.A. operation in the city of <a href=\"http://residentevil.wikia.com/Lanshiang\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lanshiang</a>, China, to contain a new bioterrorist threat during a series of attacks across the globe.</p><p>Though he's still being haunted by a \"personal trauma\" that occurred a few months prior, Chris continues to take the fight to the front-line as every country faces threat from bio-terror attacks.</p><h2>Appearance and wardrobe</h2><p>Chris Redfield was developed to be the typical \"tough guy\" type, commonly found in action movies: spiked hair, bare muscular build and likes combat knives. In his rebut, Chris wears the standard uniform of S.T.A.R.S. His clothing is a white shirt covered with a green Kevlar vest (the vest features a knife case at the left breast), gray pants, holster, knee-pads and black combat boots. The uniform did not show any change in the remake of the game (Not including Resident Evil 5, when Chris wears this outfit the sleeves of his white undershirt has been changed to a long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up.) and was also used in \"The Mansion Incident\" scenario, in The Umbrella Chronicles.</p><p>In <i>Resident Evil Code: Veronica</i>, Chris uses a variation of the S.T.A.R.S. suit. Consisting of green shirt with an Raccoon City Police Department - S.T.A.R.S. black vest, green pants and black boots. The vest has a large S.T.A.R.S. logo on the back. The outfit is seen later in an Resident Evil: The Dark Side Chronicles scenario, \"Game of Oblivion\". In Chris's epilogue, he wears a white shirt with a brown jacket. It seems to be the same alternative outfit from the original Resident Evil. In \"Umbrella's End\" scenario, from <i>Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles</i>, is set in the Caucasus. So he wears a special uniform. It consists of a white coat, black gloves, green vest, white pants and black combat boots. The knife sheath is now on the right leg, and in its place on the vest, there is a walkie-talkie radio. (This costume can be used in Darkside Chronicles if unlocked under special requirements, along with a non-canon Sheriff's costume.\"</p><p>In <i>Resident Evil 5</i> Chris is initially seen with a safari suit. After finding Reynard Fisher, Chris removes the safari jacket and puts on his military equipment. Chris is seen in the game in a mix of civilian clothing with the standard attire for the B.S.A.A..: green shirt with logos of the B.S.A.A.. on both sleeves, a large sheath for his machete on the back, radio with headset, black gloves, a flashlight on his belt, PDA, holster in the right leg, knee-pads and green shoes. Later, the player can equip him with the Melee vest and/or the Bulletproof vest.</p><p>Chris appears in <i>Resident Evil: Revelations</i>, wearing his standard uniform of B.S.A.A.. This one is very similar to the uniforms used by Josh Stone and Dan DeChant), previously seen in Resident Evil 5 Alternative Edition while playing \"Lost in Nightmares\" scenario. Also during certian sections of the game, Chris appears wearing a new tactical uniform of B.S.A.A. and later, a winter combat gear, as seen in the latest trailer.</p><p>Chris's weapon of choice is the Samurai Edge, pistol designed and created by Joseph Kendo after a 9mm Beretta model. This weapon was available for sale in Kendo's Gun Shop, owned by Joseph's brother, Robert Kendo. The Samurai Edge was made exclusively for members of S.T.A.R.S. Chris's pistol model features a blued finish slide and a silver trigger. During his search for Claire in Rockfort Island, Chris's primary weapon was a Glock 17. When Chris joined the B.S.A.A., he receives a Beretta 92F/FS with laser aim. Chris always carries a Combat Knife as a secondary weapon.</p><h2>Relationships and Personality</h2><p>Chris is close to his friends and family, specifically with his younger sister Claire and his partner Jill Valentine, whom he would both willingly give his life to protect. He cares greatly for the life of innocents, something that caused him to argue with his superiors in the military. Chris has a long-standing friendship with Barry Burton, who was an old friend of Chris' family. Barry was the one who recruited him for the Special Tactics And Rescue Service after Chris left the Air Force and began drifting.</p><p>Serving as Point Man in S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team, Chris earned the trust of his comrades. In particular, Chris developed a close friendship with Jill Valentine, the only female member of S.T.A.R.S. at the time. Forest Speyer, the sharpshooter of the Bravo Team, was once a great friend (and rival) of Chris, until the Mansion Incident, where Forest was brutally killed and turned into a zombie.</p><p>After the Mansion Incident, Chris became obsessed with the Umbrella Corporation, seeking information to bring the company down and avenge the deaths of his friends. Later, Chris and Jill formed a deadly alliance to fight Umbrella together, the B.S.A.A.</p><p>Formerly, during his activity in S.T.A.R.S., Chris exhibited a great respect for the team's leader, Albert Wesker, who also considered Chris as his best team member. However, since Chris ruined, or at least delayed Wesker's plans at the mansion, a powerful grudge formed between them. Their confrontations thereafter were always intense and violent.</p><p>However in during the Il Veltro incident, Chris was shown as a generic typical \"soldier\", focusing only on the mission and ignoring all of Jessica, his partner's advances. When asked by her whether he trusted her or not, he remarked \"Trust is measured by actions not words\" which Jessica replies \"That's so like you Chris. Its always about the job isn't it?\" He is mainly focused on his mission to fight terrorism. However, when Jill was in danger, he quickly switched focus completely onto rescuing her. It is hinted by Parker Luciani that they share a romantic bond as he says \"Maybe he's already taken\".</p><p>During a B.S.A.A. mission to capture Oswell E. Spencer, Jill sacrificed herself to save Chris from Wesker, while he could do nothing to protect Jill. Jill's perceived death was a very serious blow to Chris personally. Ever since that encounter, he became distant and cold-hearted, perhaps feeling that it was his fault and he did not deserve to be happy thereafter.</p><p>In episode one of the Resident Evil 5 viral campaign, entitled 'Ceremony', Chris is receiving an award for his courageous performance in Kijuju. However, he is hindered from delivering his speech by a sudden onset of violent memories from his mission. This could be taken as an indicator of post-traumatic stress disorder, which could possibly plague Chris after the events of Resident Evil 5.</p><p>In RE5 proper, Chris is intially shows a cold acceptance towards most of the grisly cirumstances presented in the mission. Following the battle with the first Uroboros B.O.W. he and Sheva encountered, Chris comments that if they had arrived sooner to assist DeChant and the rest of Delta Team, they would most likely be dead as well. A substantial part of his driving force during this time is seeking out Jill after he receives intel that she may still be alive. Sheva has doubts about his \"personal stake\" in the mission, but later appreciates how much he cares for his old partner.</p><p>Chris' reactions to the various threats he's faced vary over the years change with his experience. During his intial encounters with zombies and B.O.W.s in the Spencer Mansion, he was angered that it was all set up by Wesker (though in truth the outbreak was caused by James Marcus; Wesker simply took advantage of the situation). Following the events at Rockfort Island and the Antarctic Facility, Chris begins to catagorize people like Albert Wesker into simple criminal personalities, refusing to acknowledge their views and immediately dismissing them as evil.</p><p>This is most apparent during his first encounter with Sergei Vladimir, where he refers to him as \"another Umbrella psycho\", despite the latter's various machinations since before the Mansion incident. Chris then views Wesker's world plan in Kijuju with the same disdain. After he and Sheva board Wesker's stealth bomber, he is even sarcastic about the serious implications of Wesker's ambtions, going so far as to mock Wesker for taking his plans from \"comic book villians\". Strangely in Resident Evil: Revelations, after Jack Norman transforms himself, he yells \"Stop it Norman, Morgan isn't here!\" when Jack was obviously incapable of logical thought anymore.</p><p>By the time Wesker is killed, Chris is confident that living in a world without fear is worth fighting for, and the cause of combating bioterrorism exceeds all personal costs.</p><h2>Other media</h2><h3>Resident Evil: Afterlife</h3><h3>The Mercenaries</h3><h3>Marvel Vs. Capcom</h3><h3>Novels</h3><p>Chris appears as a central character in S.D. Perry's novelizations of the games. Along with Jill, he is a main character in the first book in the series, briefly appears in the second alongside Jill, is referenced in the third and returns as the main character alongside his sister, Claire, in the sixth book in the series.</p><ul><li>Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy (Based on Resident Evil)</li><li>Resident Evil: Caliban Cove (Original Novel)</li><li>Resident Evil Code: Veronica (Based on Code: Veronica)</li></ul><h3>Deck Building Game</h3><p>Premier Edition Chris has the most health of any character in the game (120) but cannot be healed, which is his starting effect. His Level 1 effect also prevents him from attaching non-Infected cards. His level 2 effect gives him +5 damage for each Infected card he's fighting, making shotguns his weapon of choice. In the game's Partner Mode, Chris' Level 1 effect still applies. Therefore, if he is assigned as a Partner Character he cannot use weapons or items. This forces the player to designate him their main character.</p><p>The promotional Chris is based on his Lost in Nightmares appearance and has 90 health. He is able to negate damage from weaker enemies (only 10 damage) with his Level 1 effect. His level 2 effect is similar insofar as it does the same thing to weapons used against him. Additionally, his second effect allows him to gain a second Explore action.</p><p>The fourth Chris card (based on his <a href=\"http://residentevil.wikia.com/Resident_Evil:_The_Darkside_Chronicles\" rel=\"nofollow\">redone</a> Code: Veronica appearance) was introduced in <i>Outbreak</i>. The second Chris card to have 90 Health, this card's first effect allows the player to discard any number of cards from their hand and then gain +20 Ammo for every card discarded. Following up on that, his second effect states that when he explores, he deals an additional 20 Damage this turn if he has over 100 ammo.</p><h2>Skills and Abilities</h2><p>Chris Redfield possesses no superhuman powers. However, he has undergone extensive military training and is an exeptional helicopter pilot. He is also well versed in the use of most firearms, and is well trained in unarmed combat. Chris is an exceptional shot and served as point man during his time as a member of Raccoon City's S.T.A.R.S Alpha team.</p>",

    "deck": "Albert Wesker is the main antagonist in the Resident Evil series. He was the leader of S.T.A.R.S. whilst secretly working for Umbrella Corporation as a Researcher. Later working for The 3rd Organization, H.C.F. (Hive/Host Capture Force), TriCell, he shifts allegiances at will to further his own goals of world domination.",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Albert Wesker was one of the dozens of children that Ozwell E. Spencer and The <a href=\"../../umbrella-corp/65-54134/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Umbrella Corporation</a> kidnapped because of their above-average intellect. He was raised by the Umbrella Corporation and stood out as a promising candidate to become part of Spencer's vision of a utopia. During this time he was unaware of Spencer's true intentions and never knew who his real parents were. When he was 17 he began work for Umbrella as a researcher. Here he is assigned to work in their Management Training Facility and later the Arklay Research Facility underneath the Spencer Estate Mansion. During which time, he was involved along with co-conspirator; William Birkin, with the assassination of former head Umbrella researcher, James Marcus. Here he becomes the chief researcher on the Tyrant Virus or <a href=\"../../t-virus/18-55351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">T-Virus</a> as it is commonly known.</p><p>After working as a researcher for nearly 20 years Wesker joins the <a href=\"../../raccoon-city/34-54094/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raccoon City</a> Police Department as a double agent for Umbrella and passes information to the company about police investigations so that it can work unimpeded. He rises to squad leader in the Special Tactics and Rescue Service (<a href=\"../../stars/65-54091/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S.T.A.R.S</a>) branch of the police. During his time with S.T.A.R.S. he sends bio-organic weapons (B.O.W.s) to fight the squad's Bravo Team. They are dispatched to investigate T-Virus infected test subjects and collects battle data on the B.O.W.s When communication with the Bravo Team is lost, the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team is sent to the Mansion, Wesker's former base of operations, to investigate. This is where the Mansion Incident takes place.</p><h2>The Mansion</h2><p>Upon arrival, the Alpha Team's pilot and two other members are initially lost to a pack of T-Virus infected dogs (also known as Cerberus B.O.W.s). The rest of the team, including Wesker himself take shelter inside the Mansion itself. Wesker orders the remaining team (<a href=\"../../chris-redfield/29-50016/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chris Redfield</a>, <a href=\"../../jill-valentine/29-50015/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jill Valentine</a> and <a href=\"../../barry-burton/29-50010/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barry Burton</a>) to split up and search the mansion. Meanwhile, he himself slips away to the facility below to monitor them. He encounters the captain of team Bravo, Enrico Marini, and kills him personally, just before Enrico could reveal Wesker's involvement with Umbrella . However, Chris and Jill inevitably find evidence to implicate Wesker and Umbrella. When they approach him however, it appears as if he is killed by a rogue T-002 Tyrant Bio-Weapon. In actuality he had injected himself with an experimental virus given to him by his former associate and Umbrella researcher, William Birkin, and allowed himself to be attacked. After Chris and Jill dispatch the Tyrant and leave, Wesker is revived by the Progenitor Virus and granted incredible superhuman powers. Unlike the other virus test subjects, he retains human form, save for cat-like orange pupils in his eyes which he hides with reflective sunglasses. Wesker escapes the facility before it is destroyed by the remaining members of Alpha Team. He leaves Umbrella and is believed dead by his former teammates and employers until he is encountered much later.</p><h2>Raccoon City Outbreak</h2><p>Sometime after the Mansion Incident, Wesker gains employment with the shadowy \"Organization\" - A rival of Umbrella Corporation. When Raccoon City suffered a large T-Virus outbreak Wesker was largely unseen. Opting to keep his cover after faking his death he instead sends an agent in his employ, <a href=\"../../ada-wong/29-55354/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ada Wong</a>. Ada was sent to secure a highly rare and valuable strain known as the G-Virus. Ada was successful and passed the <a href=\"../../g-virus/18-55375/\" rel=\"nofollow\">G-Virus</a> sample on to Wesker and the \"Organization\".</p><p>Although Ada hints at her employer, Wesker's involvement is never suspected by the main characters <a href=\"../../leon-s-kennedy/29-55353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leon Kennedy</a> and <a href=\"../../claire-redfield/29-60762/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Claire Redfield</a>.</p><h2>Rockfort Island and The Antarctic Lab</h2><p>While in hiding, Wesker amassed his own private paramilitary force called the 'Hive Capture Force' or H.C.F. Coming out of the shadows, Wesker led the force in an assault on The Rockfort Island Facility, owned by Umbrella. His goal was to capture a sample of the T-Veronica Virus. However, T-Virus infected employees and bio-organic weapons broke free throughout the facility. Alexia Ashford, a chief researcher, who was carrying the T-Veronica strain escaped. This led to Wesker heading to another Umbrella Research facility in Antarctica. Here he encountered his former team-mate Chris Redfield, who was searching for his sister. Wesker also encountered Alexia, who proved to have gained highly formidable abilities of her own, including pyrokinesis &amp; geokinesis.</p><p>Although Wesker was unable to kill either Alexia or Chris Redfield, he was able to secure a sample of the virus through the supposed corpse of Steve Burnside and escape the Antarctic Facilities' self-destruct sequence on a submarine.</p><h2>Russian Facility</h2><p>Five years after the events of <a href=\"../../resident-evil-code-veronica/49-22551/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Code Veronica</a>, Wesker was involved in a raid on an Umbrella Facility in <a href=\"../../russia/34-55706/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Russia</a>. At the same time, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were also planning an assault, determined to eliminate a powerful bio-organic weapon called T.A.L.O.S. Wesker responsible for killing numerous B.O.W.s, including 2 powerful helmeted Tyrants, reminiscent of Mr. X, named \"The Ivans,\" in the facility and a former co-worker of his at Umbrella named Sergei Vladimir who had been turned into a monster by the T-Virus. Only after Sergei's defeat did Wesker come to the conclusion that the virus brought out a latent, subconscious manifestation of the infected, pondering how, if ever infected, it would effect him. Obtaining all of Umbrella's records, Wesker launched legal action against the company under an alias, for all of the disasters they had intentionally caused. In the midst of legal litigation, Umbrella was forced to shut down permanently. It was during this time that Wesker leaked all of the virus and operational data to yet another competitor, <a href=\"../../tricell/65-56576/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tricell</a>. Wesker obtained a lucrative position at Tricell whilst simultaneously working for the \"Organization\" (Also known as The 3rd Organization) - using whichever suited him.</p><p>Wesker vowed to supersede Ozwell E. Spencer's utopian vision, which he had failed to achieve, with his own idea of the future of humanity. It was also during this time that he recruited Excella Gionne, whose ambition and intellect seemingly matched his own. With his influence she rose in power and stature within Tricell and even developed a romantic infatuation for him. One he coldly rebuked when she outlived her usefulness to him, eventually infecting her with the master strain of Uroboros.</p><h2>Los Illuminados</h2><p>A cult leader named <a href=\"../../osmund-saddler/29-55355/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Osmund Saddler</a> discovered a parasitic organism named <a href=\"../../las-plagas/18-55376/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Las Plaga</a>, which were capable of powerful mind control. Wesker and his superiors at Tricell were very interested in obtaining a sample of the Las Plaga. To this end, Wesker sent his agent Ada Wong. Also during this time Wesker recruited yet more agents, including Jack Krauser, whom would be the catalyst of the Los Illuminados incident by kidnapping President Graham's daughter. Wesker also began amassing wealth and resources that he would eventually use to fuel his own ambitions. Wesker himself stayed hidden within his personal facility, but kept in touch with Ada Wong by a video feed and contacted her regularly for status and situation updates.</p><p>Leon Kennedy however, intervened in the matter and began to impede Wesker's goals. Although Wesker ordered Ada to kill Leon she did not out of personal interest, she instead told Wesker that she hadn't found an opportunity to do so. Unconvinced, Wesker sent Jack Krauser to kill Leon. With Ada's intervention Krauser failed to eliminate Leon and was later killed by Ada herself. Ada and Leon went on to kill Saddler and she obtained a pure sample of the a Control Plaga. Ada's disloyalty to Wesker was later explained when it was revealed that he had been working against the \"Organization\" and as such, against Ada's true employers. Ada sent a false sample to Wesker personally and the real sample she obtained to the \"Organization\" directly. Wesker later left the \"Organization\", no longer believing them to benefit his plans.</p><h2>Spencer's Revelations</h2><p>2 years after the <a href=\"../../los-illuminados/65-54294/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Los Illuminados</a> Incident, once the enigmatic sibling of the Wesker Children, named Alex Wesker, seemingly abandoned Lord Spencer, it was then he allowed his location to be known. Wesker finally tracked Ozwell E. Spencer to his European Castle. Wesker, still having questions about the nature of bio-organic weapons and why they were made, went to the castle. Killing numerous bodyguards along the way, Wesker was shocked to find Spencer expecting him. It was revealed that Spencer had leaked the information to Wesker about his location and had wanted to meet with him. Spencer said that he had wanted humans to evolve to the biological viruses he had created and in doing so, give birth to a more advanced human race. He goes on to reveal that Wesker had been brainwashed to share his own values and everything Wesker has done was what he had planned all along. Albert Wesker himself was indoctrinated and raised in a controlled environment and that he was the only 'Wesker child' out of hundreds that had survived exposure to the virus.</p><p>Albert Wesker was apparently highly uninterested in sharing a brave new world with the old and decrepit Spencer however and killed him by thrusting his hand straight through Spencer's chest. Wesker proclaimed that he, not Spencer, would be the 'God' of the new world and that the 'right' was his alone now. Strangely, while pondering Spencer's words Wesker decided that changing the world was exactly what he wanted and would carry, more or less, Spencer's wishes. Having amassed a personal fortune and virtually every bio-organic virus and parasite in existence, he was perfectly poised to enact his plans. He was interrupted however by his old colleagues, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine who were there hunting the last remnants of Umbrella's leadership. A battle quickly ensued, with Wesker using his abilities to easily overpower and outmatch the duo. He cobra struck Jill across the room and began choking Chris using only one hand. Before he could kill Chris however, Jill tackled him out of a window and the two plummeted into a dark ravine. Although the two were believed dead, the both survived. Wesker provided Jill with medical treatment and put her into cyrogenic stasis. He also infected her with a chemical called P30 which gave her powerful new abilities like his, though less potent. This virus also enslaved her through mind manipulation and she became one of Wesker's most powerful agents, deciding to dawn a bird-like mask to hide her true identity.</p><h2>Africa and Wesker's End</h2><p>Later, Excella Gionne is made CEO of Tricell's African Research Facility and together with Wesker, they perfect a new virus called Uroboros. With this new virus Wesker planned to infect the world and usher in a new age for humanity. To this end he obtained a large tanker and a specialized Stealth Bomber than would release the virus into the upper atmosphere. The pair also infected nearby Africans with a new Plagas strain who were bent completely to their will and served as soldiers.</p><p>Soon, under orders from the <a href=\"../../bsaa/65-56364/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BSAA</a>, Chris Redfield and his new partner Sheva Alomar would arrive on the scene and begin investigating his activities. Although they were unaware of Wesker's involvement for the time being, they were aware of a bio-weapons dealer operating in the area: Ricardo Irving. After cornering Irving on a ship, he injects himself with an experimental virus and becomes a monster. After Chris and Sheva defeat him he reveals the name of Excella, saying that she hadn't thought he was worth the 'good stuff' since he had been defeated so easily. Although this was a clue for Chris and Sheva they were unaware of Excella's identity and Irving died before he could reveal more.</p><p>Excella meanwhile, was unhappy merely being a part of Wesker's plans and instead desired a more romantic relationship. She wished to rule by his side as a King and Queen of the new world. While Wesker did not immediately turn her down, he saw himself not as a King but as a God and had no intention of sharing his power with anyone. He had no feelings toward her or anyone but continued to see her use as a tool. After confronting Chris and Sheva with Jill Valentine he was forced to leave early and asked Jill to finish them off. Despite her enhancements, Chris and Sheva were able to overcome her by removing the device that injected her with the chemical that controlled her mind. When the pair chased Wesker onto his tanker he didn't hesitate to betray Excella and inject her with the Uroboros virus to buy him time, nearby a large pile of corpses implied to have been slaughtered by Wesker himself. Instead of becoming superhuman like Wesker, the virus rejected Excella's DNA and she was turned into a monster.</p><p>It is revealed by Jill that in order to stabilize the virus inside him, Wesker needed regular doses of a special serum, named PG67A/W, and that the incorrect dosage would greatly weaken him. Having obtained vials of the serum earlier from the now deceased Excella, the duo confront Wesker aboard his freighter, inside the Stealth Bomber's hanger hidden below deck. After fighting through his remaining Majini slaves, the two managed to inject him with the serum after weakening him by firing RPG missiles at him in pitch black settings, even so, Wesker wrestled with the missiles using his bare hands, until Chris, or Sheva, would shoot the rocket and cause it to explode point blank in Wesker's face, causing little to no damage, however, this would weaken him enough to catch him off guard and weaken him with the serum. Weakened, Wesker fled aboard the jet. Chris and Sheva too, managed to get aboard just before the aircraft took off. Although physically outmatched they managed to once again inject Wesker with the serum, weakening him further. However, in the ensuing battle the plane lost altitude and crashed into a nearby volcano.</p><p>Although Chris and Sheva survived, Wesker wasn't finished yet. He smashed his fist through the steel of a containment missile and bathed himself in the Uroboros virus, transforming himself even further. He developed powerful tentacle-like appendages and absorbed nearby steel debris as weaponry. Wesker's usual calm and cool manner gave way to an almost feral rage. Despite his determination to destroy his nemesis, the ground beneath Wesker eventually gave way and he collapsed into liquid hot magma. A rescue helicopter with Jill Valentine aboard came for Chris and Sheva, but as they were about to fly away, the down but not defeated Wesker used a tentacle to latch onto the helicopter and try to take Chris, Sheva and Jill down with him. Chris and Sheva managed to procure a pair of RPG-7 Rocket Launchers from the interior of the helicopter and their final shots blasted Wesker back. Decapitating him and sending his body into the lava which consumed his corpse.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Wesker was a very fit, cunning, and intelligent person even before enhancement, having once been a top researcher for Umbrella before deciding to join the Umbrella Security Division as head of the force, and later, the special forces. After his injection of a strand of the Progenitor Virus, along with the mysterious prototype virus given to him by colleague William Birkin, he has demonstrated: superhuman strength enough to throw ten men 50 meters (164.04ft) with a single punch, superhuman speed able to run at least 72.4kph (45mph), and superhuman agility able to run on walls for a short distance.</p><p>Notable achievements of his superhuman speed, accelerated vision, and agility included being capable of dodging bullets at practically point blank range with nearly no effort (including rapidfire, multiple shot weapons, grenades, and Rocket Launchers), being able to cover great distances in short time (relatively equal to the time it would take using a fast vehicle), adhering to walls and ceilings like a spider (seen during his fight with Chris and Sheva on the Uroboros-loaded plane), and performing short dashes of speed faster than the normal Human brain could process (causing him to appear to be teleporting).</p><p>Some say that due to the virus he did not change in appearance (still youthful) although he is aging (48), and made him smarter. Ironically, his own serum was also his greatest weakness, overdoses of the serum would cause him to be poisoned (although he didn't live long enough to know if he can heal from it). The overdose of serum caused his vision to deteriorate and blur, his agility seemed to be slowed slightly (though he still remained lethal and could dodge some attacks) and blood veins to pop out on his head, which also caused him to experience debilitating headaches. His aim, while using his weapon, is also quite inhuman as shown at the end of umbrella chronicles.</p><p>Notable achievements of his increased strength included being able to lift large aircraft missiles with one hand and throwing them, lifting large steel girders off his body, lifting an adult human off the ground with one hand effortlessly, thrusting straight through the chest of a person with his fingertips, killing a large Hunter B.O.W. with just one kick, sending someone flying with a single backhand swipe, and punching through a solid sheet steel missile.</p><p>The injection also gave Wesker a low-level rapid healing factor which, coupled with his incredible endurance, rendered him nearly invincible to conventional damage. A rocket exploding right in his hands was only sufficient to weaken him for a moment, and thousands of pounds of steel girders falling a few stories on top of him failed to even incapacitate him, merely dazing him for a few brief seconds, and despite having his face hideously burned, he quickly healed up. He also healed quickly after getting shot in the head by Sheva and falling a great distance out of a jet.</p><p>After absorbing large amounts of Uroboros from a missile containing it (seemingly in the process of bonding with it). He became even more resistant to damage, much stronger, increased regeneration, obtained the use of the leaches, and finally, higher jumping ability, despite the vulnerability of the crimson glowing, heart-like growth appearing in his chest briefly during the final battle.</p><p>With these powers, Wesker mainly did not require weaponry other than his brute strength during combat, combined with a sufficient strategy and some meticulous observation. However, he did keep his S.T.A.R.S. issued Samurai Edge handgun holstered at all times, as if to add insult to the team he once captained, and was known to <i>never</i> let his guard down, even outside the battlefield.</p><h2>Wardrobe</h2><p>Wesker wears a different outfit for each of his appearances, but they are always black. He always keeps his trademark sunglasses, even in situations that seem inappropriate, such as during S.T.A.R.S. operations in the middle of the night. In <i>Resident Evil</i> and <i>Resident Evil Zero</i>, he wears a standard S.T.A.R.S. uniform similar to those of Chris and Barry, but completely black, with a navy blue under-shirt. He wears a more streamlined outfit in <i>Resident Evil Code: Veronica</i> with the acronyms H.C.F (Hive/Host Capture Force) written on the back. During a fist-fight with Chris Redfield, his sunglasses are knocked from his face, revealing that his eyes have changed from normal human eyes to slitted eyes with a red-orange hue. He wears a different, more sophisticated outfit during his appearance in <i>Resident Evil 4</i> and the <i>Dark Legacy</i> levels in <i>Umbrella Chronicles</i>, sporting a black turtle-neck sweatshirt, black trousers and jacket over his turtle neck, as well as black gloves. In <i>Resident Evil 5</i>, his attire becomes more sinister and supports a leather trench coat with black leather boots, gloves, pants and a short sleeve shirt all complete with his trademark sunglasses.</p><h2>In other media</h2><p>When <i>Resident Evil</i> was being considered for the basis of a film, George A. Romero and Paul W. S. Anderson competed for production rights with their scripts. In Romero's script, Wesker was not the captain of S.T.A.R.S., but instead a colonel. Though, he remains a double agent like in the games.</p><p>Albert Wesker was the chairman of Umbrella, holding regular meetings from his office in Tokyo via hologram, and heading the Umbrella Committee even during the Global T-virus outbreak. Wesker, just like his game counterpart, serves as the primary antagonist of the film series. In recent events, the last movie he appeared in was a struggle of control between himself and The Red Queen, distancing himself from Umbrella and choosing to aid Alice in her escape by hiring such people as Leon Kennedy &amp; Barry Burton, also having Ada Wong accompany Alice during her journey. In the end, his scheme was to once more infect Alice with the T-Virus in order to help him tip the balance of humanity's last stand against the B.O.W.'s unleashed by Umbrella.</p><h3>Lost Planet 2</h3><p>As of November 17, 2009, Gamestop has announced an exclusive bonus item regarding its reservation. This item appears to be a Wesker and revolver skin. He is just merely a skin, however, as he doesn't appear in the game's main storyline and is just considered as extra content.</p><p>He is unlockable via a code inputted in the game's Edit menu. His code is \"72962792\".</p><h3>Marvel Vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</h3><p>Albert Wesker was unveiled as a playable character along with Spider-Man at the Tokyo Game Show 2010, appearing in his <i>Resident Evil 5</i> attire. He has been shown using martial arts, his Samurai Edge and the ability to \"teleport\" with a move called Phantom Move, and also packs the Windfall, Panther Fang(as his standing medium), and Tiger Uppercut (also as a special) as normal moves, Cobra Strike, Ghost Butterfly, Mustang Kick (as a throw attack), and Jaguar Kick (Renamed from Knee Cannon and can be done from a new move called Jaguar Dash) as special moves, and the Rhino Charge as a Hyper Combo, this time done as a reversal/counter move. A new move which is a stronger version of his Collide attack acts as one of his Hyper Combos, named the Phantom Dance. (Jokingly called \"Maximum Wesker\" by Seth Killian due to resembling Spider-Man's Maximum Spider, which is even referenced by Deadpool in UMVC3.)</p><p>In his Level 3 Hyper Combo, Lost in Nightmares (named after a RE5 DLC), Wesker attacks the opponent with fast attacks while \"teleporting\" from one side to the other, and at the end he launches the opponent then drops a missile on them, similar to the second time you fight Wesker in Resident Evil 5 (where if you waited too long he will start to launch missiles at Chris Redfield or Sheva Alomar). His rival in this game appears to be Spider-Man, since both characters acquired super human strength through genetic manipulation (radioactive spider bite, and virus injection respectively), both have very fast reflexes and have a lot of stamina. Spider-Man quotes: \"You have great power Albert, but you're not very responsible with it\" upon defeating him in battle. He is also one of the few characters to have a counter move.</p><p>Wesker can also lose his shades in battle, either by constantly getting hit to have them shatter, or by performing the Phantom Dance (he'll remove them at the start of the attack). If tagged out, then tagged back in however, oddly enough his sunglasses will be back on in normal condition, even if his glasses are broken part-way instead of being removed. He can also regain his glasses by taunting. This aesthetic detail surprisingly changes his gameplay. In the game, characters can activate a \"super mode\" called X-Factor, which increases their speed, damage output, and regenerates their health. Its level is determined by how many partners the player's character has lost (Level 2 for one partner down, Level 3 for both, etc.). He seems to shout \"damn it!\" during its activation possibly nodding to the amount of control needed for his virus(his X-Factor may be Wesker's virus out of control for a brief moment).</p><p>In Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Wesker's health levels were nerfed (1,100,000 to 1,000,000, same amount as Ryu). He also can increase the damage of Phantom Dance by rapidly tapping buttons, a new feature given to several if not almost all characters' Hyper Combos in UMVC3. Also an added feature is the removal of Wesker's shades increases his speed and damage equivalent to a level 1 X-Factor, and can be stacked with the additional levels. Therefore, after Wesker has lost his sunglasses and both of his partners, he can activate what is essentially a Level 4 X-Factor, making him the fastest character in the game.</p><p>His music theme is a rock remix of the Resident Evil 5 song Wind Of Madness, featured as a orchestral version (digital in the OST) when Chris and Sheva fight against him in the Tricell ship.</p><p>In the game's story Wesker is first shown speaking to Dr. Doom in the prologue comic. He overhears a plan to steal the power of Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds. Wesker is intrigued, believing the name \"exudes power\". After Galactus becomes a threat to both worlds he seemingly joins the heroes and villains of both sides to stop him. Of course, if Wesker is not used by the player he may turn out to be one of Galactus' Heralds. However, it is revealed in Wesker's arcade ending that he was simply standing by as the others fought him so that he could overtake them when they're all weakened. Wesker is later shown in an unidentified research lab, having captured all of the heroes. He wonders aloud to himself which one of them has the potential to \"become the next Alexia or Lisa Trevor\". Alternatively, Wesker is shown in Chris' ending being prosecuted by none other than Matt Murdock (a.k.a. Daredevil, the Man Without Fear). Wesker is restrained in a straight jacket and is directly accused of the Raccoon City Incident of 1998. Wesker openly gloats that he \"caused quite a mess there.\" He attempts to undo his restraints and resist the bailiff, but is stopped by Chris, who threatens to pin him to the floor. Wesker is briefly mentioned in Hulk's ending, and after the Hulk easily disposes of the Nemesis, Chris advises to \"take it easy\" on Wesker. In Dormammu's ending, Wesker appears with other villains, plotting when to take over both worlds.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Little is known about Karnevil. He was sent to Hell for his crimes, but was too much for them to handle. He even claimed that he taught the demons about torture during his stay. He later joined the <a href=\"/pentacle/4060-50023/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50023\"> Pentacle</a>, as the counterpart to <a href=\"/detective-chimp/4005-11270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11270\"> Detective Chimp</a>. He captured and tortured Detective Chimp, but Chimp escaped. He then beat up and captured Karnevil who was subsequently sent to the <a href=\"/dark-tower/4020-57499/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57499\"> Dark Tower</a>.</p><p>Karnevil was one of the villains stranded on planet <a href=\"/hell-planet/4020-55870/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55870\"> Salvation</a>. He idolized the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\"> Joker</a>. To prove that, he decided to be more like the Joker than the Joker. He planned to turn the Joker's skin into a cape. For a while he acted as the Joker's bodyguard, preventing <a href=\"/bolt/4005-5932/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5932\"> Bolt</a> from electrocuting him. When all the villains left the planet, the Joker insulted Karnevil, and left.</p><p>Kid Karnevil infiltrated the JSA, posing as the All-American Kid. He claimed that the original All-American Kid was a sidekick to <a href=\"/mr-america/4005-31930/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31930\"> Mr. America</a> during WWII. He only briefly held the mantle, and was shot in the back soon after by a Nazi, leading for his contributions to the war effort to be all but forgotten. Karnevil pretended to be his grandson, Billy Armstrong, saying that he found a large amount of newspaper clippings and documents in his Grandmother's attic that contained all sorts of information on the original. Devoting himself to becoming the new All-American Kid, he trained hard to become a proficient gymnast of at least Olympic caliber.</p><p>Soon after, All-American Kid introduced himself to the current Mr. America, becoming his sidekick and joining the <a href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\"> JSA</a> in the process. Due to space constraints, All-American Kid was placed in a room with <a href=\"/king-chimera/4005-64048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64048\"> King Chimera</a>. The two didn't get along, mainly due to Chimera's attitude. Karnevil stabbed Michael Holt, the second <a href=\"/mr-terrific/4005-19179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19179\"> Mr. Terrific</a> before hiding the crime. He pretended he had been mind-controlled, and that his mind was wiped to make him forget the incident. <a href=\"/jay-garrick/4005-2395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2395\"> Jay Garrick</a>, using his super speed to re-construct the security system, discovered Kid's actions and the JSA quickly levied accusations against him. He's since been taken into custody by the team. He escaped, hitting Mr. America over the head. He reveals that he was working for an unknown entity, and that his goal all along was to capture <a href=\"/obsidian/4005-9359/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9359\"> Obsidian</a>, since the entity cannot touch him. Karvevil places Obsidian, who had been severely injured, into a device, completing his mission. However, he did not count on Mr. Terrific's recovery. Terrific reveals that he knew who All-American Kid really was. Karnevil acknowledges that Mr. Terrific is right, and prepares to attack him. Mr. Terrific knocks Karnevil out with his <a href=\"/t-spheres/4055-47354/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-47354\"> T-Spheres</a>.</p><p><strong>New 52: Earth 2 World's End</strong></p><p>Karnevil works with John Constantine and his band of misfits for a brief time but when he shows discontent for Todd Rice aka Obsidian for being included in their plan of attack, Constantine empties his gun into Karnevil's head. Constantine then asks Brainwave Jr and Jonni Thunder (female version of Johnny Thunder) if they have a problem with Obsidian being included which inevitably they don't. Its possible that Obsidian and Constantine are lovers and Constantine felt insulted by Karnevil's remark towards Obsidian.      </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Karnevil has no powers, but is a ruthless and sadistic killer. He is an expert in many kinds of torture.</p>",

    "deck": "Rock, once a simple robot made by the world-renowned Dr. Light, was modified to become Rock Man (Mega Man outside of Japan) and fight against the evil robots sent by Dr. Wily.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Rock was built by <a href=\"/dr-light/4005-70977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70977\">Dr. Light</a> to act as a utility droid as well as serve as his son. Just prior to building the small boy-robot, Dr. Light had just released his new industrial Robot Masters: <a href=\"/guts-man/4005-73493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73493\">Guts Man</a>, <a href=\"/cut-man/4005-73492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73492\">Cut Man</a>, <a href=\"/ice-man/4005-73494/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73494\">Ice Man</a>, <a href=\"/bomb-man/4005-73496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73496\">Bomb Man</a>, <a href=\"/elec-man/4005-3869/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3869\">Elec Man</a>, and <a href=\"/fire-man/4005-73495/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73495\">Fire Man</a>. All was going well until all of a sudden, all of the industrial robots went berserk. Destroying everything in sight and taking control of all of the nearby utility and security droids, the town was thrown into a panic. Of course there was a reason behind this tragic event, and it was in the best interest of Dr. Light to figure out just what exactly had happened. But first, the Robot Masters had to be stopped. Rock, seeing the horrible destruction the industrial robots were causing, volunteered to have himself converted into a battle robot by Dr. Light. The idea was approved! Dr. Light wanted Rock to be fully prepared for what was to come. In fact, Dr. Light knew that robot hardiness would not be enough, so he gave Rock the best armor he could make. This new armor was to make Rock faster and stronger. Rock had already demonstrated his courage, but even that wouldn't be enough. Able to tap directly to his power cells, Rock was armed with a Mega Buster in which he was to use very wisely. Dr. Light then assured Rock that if even the Mega Buster should not be enough, he will have the ability to adapt the abilities of other Robot Masters by means of a Unique Copy Chip built inside of him. Last but not least Rock was given an armored helmet with the ability to communicate with Dr. Light when away for heroic tasks. The newly improved Rock Man (Mega Man) proceeded to defeat the industrial robots, and approached the mad-man behind it all. <a href=\"/dr-wily/4005-71039/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71039\">Dr. Wily</a>, Dr. Light's old assistant, had used specialized computer chips to take control of the minds of Light's industrial <a href=\"/robot-masters/4060-57684/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57684\">Robot Masters</a>. Mega Man defeated Wily's behemoth the Yellow Devil, and forced him to flee from the scene. Mega Man was able to destroy the control device during the fight and was able to free the industrial robots from Wily's control.</p><p>Wily quickly returns after his defeat at the hands of Mega Man with a new group of Robot Masters. Specifically engineered for battle: <a href=\"/air-man/4005-78034/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78034\">Air Man</a>, <a href=\"/wood-man/4005-10766/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10766\">Wood Man</a>, <a href=\"/quick-man/4005-73497/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73497\">Quick Man</a>, <a href=\"/bubble-man/4005-78038/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78038\">Bubble Man</a>, <a href=\"/metal-man/4005-78036/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78036\">Metal Man</a>, <a href=\"/flash-man/4005-78035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78035\">Flash Man</a>, and <a href=\"/crash-man/4005-78037/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78037\">Crash Man</a> were all made to pit themselves against the blue bomber. After defeating them, one-by-one, in armed combat, Mega Man was led to Wily's new headquarters. Mega Man was able to defeat Wily once again, but he escaped before he could be detained.</p><p>Wily attacks Mega Man countless more times, but Mega Man always defeats him. However, when eventually Mega Man found the chance to eliminate Dr. Wily from existence, he failed to do so, capturing him instead. Mega Man's adventures take place during the unspecific years of 200X-20XX.</p><h2>Powers</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2271675\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/2271675-mega_man___mega_man__11.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2131294964029\" data-width=\"1112\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1112px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/2271675-mega_man___mega_man__11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2271675\"><img alt=\"Mega Buster\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38919/2271675-mega_man___mega_man__11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/2271675-mega_man___mega_man__11.jpg 1112w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/38919/2271675-mega_man___mega_man__11.jpg 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38919/2271675-mega_man___mega_man__11.jpg 791w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px\" data-width=\"791\"></a><figcaption>Mega Buster</figcaption></figure><p>MegaMan is a synthetic lifeform that was upgraded from his original form to possess significant superhuman strength, endurance, and durability to fight against any threat that came against mankind.  He has the ability to overcome a wide variety of adversaries, and has defeated entire robot armies thanks to these abilities and his considerable on-board weapons arsenal.</p><p>MegaMan's main weapon is the Mega Buster. Built into his arm, it is capable of powerful energy blasts. This power can be charged for greater power.</p><p>On top of his Buster, Mega Man has the ability to copy the powers of any enemy he defeats. Through this method, Mega Man has literally amassed hundreds of different weapons, although he does not like to use them too much as it quickly uses up his internal energy.</p><p>He is able to copy other robot powers by simply touching them and is able to work with the robot with the same powers together</p><p>Mega Man's boots are also equipped with the slide function, making him more nimble, agile and faster.</p><p>Mega Man also has many assist abilities as well, including platforms and rocket sleds to help navigate Wily's traps. He has Roll and <a href=\"/auto/4005-81936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81936\">Auto</a> to assist him with parts and upgrades as well as Beat and Eddie to assist him on the field. Mega Man's most valuable team mate is his dog <a href=\"/rush/4005-50443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50443\">Rush</a>, who is able to launch or fly Mega Man to distant platforms or across hazards.</p><p>Mega Man can drink an E-Tank to restore his energy and similar items to restore his weapon energy.</p><h2>Weakness</h2><p>His armor can be highly damaged by material that can puncture such as sharp spike surfaces. He will later on get an upgrade to lower damage but this defense protects him a limited amount of times.</p><p>He has to follow the robot rules of not hurting humans unless that human is becoming a threat to other humans. He is clever enough to contain without hurting anyone.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-269328\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/269328-4918-megaman-x.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.532\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/269328-4918-megaman-x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-269328\"><img alt=\"Mega Man X\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/269328-4918-megaman-x.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/269328-4918-megaman-x.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>Mega Man X</figcaption></figure><p>Many heroes have dawned the iconic blue armor of Mega Man over the course of history. <a href=\"/megaman-x/4005-49874/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49874\">Mega Man X</a> is an upgraded version living about 100 years later, in 21XX.</p><p><a href=\"/mega-man-volnutt/4005-78626/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78626\">Mega Man Volnutt</a> (Not to be misnamed Mega Man Legends, which is the name of the game he debuted in) is a version far later, in the 81st century.</p><p>There is also an alternate timeline of the series (see Megaman.EXE below), in which the Mega Man Battle Network/Starforce versions correspond to the Classic series and X series in the core timeline.

The time line split based upon their disagreements about what technologies to develop. Wily wanted to develop robotics; Doctor Light believed (quite accurately) that robots could too easily be harnessed for ill, reasoning instead that Internet technology should be developed, and that the increased communications it fostered would help to bring about world peace. <a href=\"/megamanexe/4005-49077/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49077\">Megaman.EXE</a> is Mega Man's counterpart in the time line where the Internet was developed instead of robotics. His adventures involve hunting and eliminating computer viruses, casually sparring with his friends, and defending against Dr. Wily, who in revenge at not getting his way, seeks to destroy the world Dr. Light built.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Captain N: The Game Master (1989-1991)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1312094\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1312094-megaman_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.64705882352941\" data-width=\"340\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 340px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1312094-megaman_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1312094\"><img alt=\"Mega Man from Captain N - The Game Master\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1312094-megaman_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1312094-megaman_super.jpg 340w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1312094-megaman_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mega Man from Captain N - The Game Master\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1312094-megaman_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1312094-megaman_super.jpg 340w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1312094-megaman_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mega Man from Captain N - The Game Master</figcaption></figure><p>Mega Man appeared in <em>Captain N: The Game Master</em> as a consistent member of the hero's team, and was voiced by Doug Paker.

However, later episodes in the series would focus on his games a little more, introducing other elements like Dr. Wily and his robots.</p><h3>Mega Man (1994-1995)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310740\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1310740-megamantitlecard.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.74947368421053\" data-width=\"475\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 475px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1310740-megamantitlecard.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310740\"><img alt=\"Mega Man as he appears in his cartoon, with Rush.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1310740-megamantitlecard.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1310740-megamantitlecard.jpg 475w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1310740-megamantitlecard.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mega Man as he appears in his cartoon, with Rush.\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1310740-megamantitlecard.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1310740-megamantitlecard.jpg 475w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1310740-megamantitlecard.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mega Man as he appears in his cartoon, with Rush.</figcaption></figure><p>In the 1990s, Mega Man got his own cartoon. He was voiced by Ian James Corlett, and as such, has bit of a Canadian accent in this series. This Mega Man was initially planned to resemble his game counterpart closely, but later concerns were raised that a short, stocky and cute protagonist might alienate Western audiences, and as such, he was redesigned to look more mature, being made taller and more muscular, similar to the standard appearance of superheroes in Western media. Ultimately, though, this version of Mega Man resembles his game counterpart much more than the one in <em>Captain N</em>. His mannerisms also bear a rather uncanny resemblance to the way Spiderman was portrayed in his 1990s cartoon; here Mega Man is a good-natured hero who often wisecracks during battles.</p><p>This version of Mega Man shares his game counterpart's ability to copy the weapons of his enemies, but it works a little bit differently. Unlike in the games, Mega Man doesn't need to defeat his enemies to use their weapons--here touching them is enough. Also, in this cartoon Mega Man does not change color when using a copied weapon; instead an icon on his helmet changes to represent the new weapon.</p><h3>Megaman NT Warrior (2002-2003)</h3><p>Voiced by Andrew Francis</p><h3>Mega Man Star Force (2006-2007)</h3><p>Voiced by Kyle Hebert</p>",

    "deck": "Adrian Lynn wass a paraplegic who took an experimental drug that enhanced activities in her adrenal gland. After overdosing, because the effects only lasted 30 minutes, she became an amazon type beast called Adrenazon.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Adrian Lynn was married to Michael Lynn. Michael Lynn, while driving in a rush and apparently intoxicated, caused a car accident that killed their two sons and paralyzed Adrian. Michael was prosecuted by Jennifer Walters, <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\"> She-Hulk</a>, and was convicted of 3 counts of manslaughter and sent to prison. Michael, not being able to handle the pressure of jail and guilt, wound up committing suicide. Adrian Lynn then checked into Bellevue as a resident patient. Dr. Stopplemoor, a physician, held what seemed to be a cure to paralysis. He tested it out on Adrian and found that it actually worked. What the drug did was increase the activity in the adrenal gland, which in turn increased the flow of epinephrine, correcting the mistakes the paralysis had caused. Unfortunately it only lasted for 30 minutes, which enraged Adrian. So she took the remaining vials, and injected herself with larger doses to allow the cure to have a more permanent effect. It allowed her to walk and also enhanced her strength to superhuman levels, but the formula decreased her sanity. As a result, she believed that She-Hulk framed her husband and purposely destroyed her life; so she vowed to destroy She-Hulk’s. Adrenazon disguised herself as She-Hulk and planned to frame She-hulk. The plan would have been foiled by Dr. Stopplemoor, if he had been able to stop her. He was killed in front of a lot witnesses and the police were called in. Adrenazon called Jennifer Walters to come, and when she arrived the police were ready to arrest She-Hulk.</p><p>She-Hulk broke out to investigate the old doctor's murder and was accompanied by another named <a href=\"/nosferata/4005-42921/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42921\"> Nosferata</a>. When they met up with Adrenazon, they got knocked out and She-Hulk was left for the police as she continued to be framed by Adrenazon. She-Hulk was now trapped in the Tombs.</p><p>After that she pressured a woman by the name of <a href=\"/blonde-phantom/4005-41880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41880\"> Louise Mason</a> to pose as Walters. However, there were obvious differences between the two and this plan failed. Nosferata went to free She-Hulk and they both confronted Adrenazon. She-Hulk knew the two were evenly matched and tried to outwit her. She-Hulk was trying to outrun her and Adrenazon used an earthmover to catch her. Adrenazon started to relapse to the day of the accident and came to her senses. She gave up her Adrenazon alter-ego and started try to cope with the fact that her family was deceased.</p><p> </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Adrenazon was created by <a href=\"/scott-lobdell/4040-40996/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40996\">Scott Lobdell</a> and <a href=\"/dennis-jensen/4040-29191/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-29191\">Dennis Jensen</a>, and she first appeared in <a href=\"/marvel-comics-presents-123-passion-play-part-1-of-/4000-36863/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-36863\">Marvel Comics Presents #123</a>.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Adrenazon had the strength to lift approximately 75 tons. Adrenazon also possessed enhanced speed, stamina, durability, and agility and retained her intellect; but not her sanity.</p><p> </p><h2>Characteristics</h2><p>Height: 6'7\"</p><p>Weight: 400 lbs.</p><p>Eye: Brown</p><p>Hair: Brunette (has green wig)</p><p>Distinguishing Features: Bulging Veins</p>",

    "description": "<h2><b>Origin</b></h2><p>Bebop was just a regular human thug in a New York street gang. He sported a purple mohawk and shades. Soon, Bebop and the rest of the crew were hired by the evil ninja named <a href=\"/shredder/4005-42406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42406\">Shredder</a>. Shredder used Bebop and the gang to fight the <a href=\"/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/4060-26934/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26934\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, but the lackies were defeated. Shredder used <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mutagen/4055-55117/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55117\">mutagen</a> to transform Bebop into a stronger version of himself. Bebop then assumed the form of a humanoid warthog.</p><p>Bebop alongside Rocksteady served as members of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/foot-clan/4060-47999/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47999\">Foot Clan</a> loyal to Shredder and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/krang/4005-44710/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44710\">Krang</a>, but after the events of \"Final Conflict\" both mutants were transported to a primitive world where they lived among the animals and decided that violence was not in their nature after all, they dedicated themselves to the wild and upon a short return to Earth they \"liberated\" the animals from a New York city Zoo, and while holding the TMNT at gunpoint, took Krang and Bellybomb on their spaceship, but not with the intent of rescueing the alien warlords, but rather on the way back to their newfound home, Bebop and Rocksteady returned Krang and Bellybomb to their prison on dump world.</p><h3>Creation</h3><p>Beebop along with his partner Rocksteady were created and designed by Peter Laird. This was not done for the comic series however and was instead done for the toy line that was being made by Playmates. They were later added into the first Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon show and given their names and, their personalities. Their origin story was written by David Wise based on instructions from Fred Wolf (the producer of the cartoon show to \"put more mutants in the series\".</p><p><ins><strong>IDW</strong></ins></p><h2><strong>City Fall</strong></h2><p>Along with his best friend Rocksteady, Bebop was chosen for mutation by Karai after she stole mutagen from Krang on Burnow Island. During the City Fall storyline, Karai appears with the two brutes as the Shredder and the Foot Clan are under a surprise attack by the Turtles and their allies. They quickly turn the tables against the Turtles as Bebop lands solid blows on Raphael and Donatello. He soon suffers an invisible attack that drives him through a wall. At the end of the fight, Bebop and Rocksteady are blasted with a grenade by Old Hob.</p><h2><strong>Vs. The Turtles and the Mutanimals</strong></h2><p>Later, Bebop and Rocksteady meet Pigeon Pete whom tells them about the mutant army his boss Old Hob is putting together. The two brutes decide to check it out once they hear that \"turtles\" are a part of the gang. They then decide to smash open an ATM machine to buy some food before the fight.</p><p>They later come across Old Hob and the Turtles; before a fight can break out Old Hob attempts to reason with them by stating that they're only slaves to Shredder. Old Hob changes his mind about them joining when they reveal themselves to be half-human. Hob responds by shooting Bebop in the stomach and Rocksteady in the face, thus the fight begins. Bebop holds his own and even helps over powers the two teams, punching one of them across a city block on to a roof. He then suffers being electrocuted and is later beaten together with his partner. They then leave when they see everyone has left and Bebop promises to Rocksteady they will keep their defeat a secret from Karai.</p><h2>Attack on the Technodrome</h2><p>The Shredder enters into an alliance with Donatello to attack the Technodrome realizing that Krang is the greatest threat to his one day rule of the planet. However, he doesn't trust Donatello completely, therefore before departing to Burnow Island to confront Krang and his forces. He leaves Bebop and Rocksteady on a special mission to watch over Donatello, warning the Turtle he will have his two henchmen kill him at the first sign of treachery.</p><p>On Burnow Island, Shredder's forces are immediately ambushed, and he engages into a death battle with Krang. Bloody and facing certain death, Krang reveals to Shredder that he was betrayed. Later, he issues the orders to Bebop and Rocksteady to kill Donatello. The fight is rather brief; Bebop engages in the fight first and receives quick assistance from Rocksteady. Bebop attempts to kill Donatello but is blasted from behind by Metal Head, which leads to the robot suffering serious damage at Rocksteady's hands. Bebop prevents Donatello from making his escape as he hits him with a computer monitor and then pummels him. Rocksteady then lands the crippling blow to the Turtle, bashing him across his back with his sledgehammer and smashing his shell. Bebop and Rocksteady then walk away leaving the Turtle for dead, as they receive new orders from Karai.</p><h2>Vengeance</h2><p>The Foot Clan are currently in disarray after suffering a huge defeat. Karai names herself leader with the Shredder being thought dead. Bebop along with Rocksteady are attempting to search for Hun whom Karai thinks has deserted them. Karai tries very hard to maintain moral and discipline within the foot, then suddenly Shredder returns with a new plan to kill Splinter after establishing a shaky alliance with Baxter Stockman. Karai sabotages Shredder's plan in order to keep the Foot's honor in place, and thus strikes a deal with Splinter for the Turtles and himself to battle the Shredder and his mutant minions in a tournament called the Gauntlet, where the winning team will face off against the leader of the losing team. Bebop and Rocksteady answer the call to do battle.</p><p>Bebop along with Rocksteady, Koya, and Bludgeon lunge into battle with Bebop doing pretty well getting the best of Leonardo, and with some help from Koya, his team quickly gains the upper hand due to their superior strength. The Turtles regroup but this time Bebop suffers a laser blast to the face from Donatello in Metal Head's body; then Bebop and along with Rocksteady finds themselves strictly facing off against Raphael and Michelangelo. Raphael puts together a plan that sees the two brutes destroying each other in their attempt to kill them. Despite their best efforts, Bebop and Rocksteady have plenty of fight left, plus they see through Raphael's scheme. In a last ditch effort, Donatello in Metal Head's body, self destructs in a kamikaze attack to bring them down, and in the process have his mind restored to his originally body. The two brutes are barely conscious, until Donatello teleports to the battle in his real body and finishes them both off with strong Bo strikes.</p><p> </p><h2>Skills</h2><p>Bebop like Rocksteady is a master with heavy weapons, he though seems to prefer machine guns or smgs. He is a brawler who seems to know some boxing but not much. He seems to be the more accurate one of the two with guns, this is shown by him using a sniper.</p><p><strong>IDW</strong></p><p>Bebop is immensely strong and is capable of taking on the entire Turtles team. He carries a chainsaw and uses his strength for a big advantage. He's a vicious street fighter and will use any object around him as a weapon to get the job done. He is also very durable being able to withstand being shot at close range in the stomach and face, survive an electrical attack, missile attack, and even a building being dropped on him.</p><p> </p><h2>Relationships</h2><p>Bebop is a little more scared of Shredder than Rocksteady but like Rocksteady seems to think their on friendly terms. He likes working for the foot clan, and hates the Turtles with a passion. He and Rocksteady are best friends and always enjoy eachothers company.</p>",

    "deck": "Always walking with Bebop following the orders of Shredder and Krang.",
    "description": "<p>Rocksteady and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/bebop/4005-50049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50049\">Bebop</a> were originally regular human members from a gang of thugs until <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shredder/4005-42406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42406\">Shredder</a> made them his henchmen. To make them more powerful and to test his mutant serum, Shredder had a rhino and a wild boar stolen from the local zoo and their genes were mixed with Bebop and Rocksteady's. Despite being mutant human/animal hybrids, the two aren't very smart.</p><p>Although in this version of the Turtles, Rocksteady is an enemy, his character was likely influenced by the Usagi Yojimbo character <a href=\"/gen/4005-5912/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5912\">Murakami Gennosuke</a>.</p><h3>Creation</h3><p>Rocksteady along with his partner Beebop were created and designed by Peter Laird. This was not done for the comic series however and was instead done for the toy line that was being made by Playmates. They were later added into the first Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon show and given their names and, their personalities. Their origin story was written by David Wise based on instructions from Fred Wolf (the producer of the cartoon show to \"put more mutants in the series\".</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Appearances Throughout Comics</h2><p>Rocksteady in most early comics was shown to be burly with a bit of a pot belly. But recently he is now shown now to be very muscular before and after mutation and much smarter (not much) than his early counterpart.</p><p><ins><strong>IDW</strong></ins></p><h2><strong>City Fall</strong></h2><p>Along with his best friend Bebop, Rocksteady was chosen for mutation by Karai after she stole mutagen from Krang on Burnow Island. During the City Fall storyline, Karai appears with the two brutes as the Shredder and the Foot Clan are under a surprise attack by the Turtles and their allies. They quickly turn the tables against the Turtles as Rocksteady easily over powers them taking a sai to his arm as if nothing happened. He soon suffers an invisible attack that drives him through a wall. At the end of the fight, Rocksteady and Bebop are blasted with a grenade by Old Hob.</p><h2><strong>Vs. The Turtles and the Mutanimals</strong></h2><p>Later, Rocksteady and Bebop meet Pigeon Pete whom tells them about the mutant army his boss Old Hob is putting together. The two brutes decide to check it out once they hear that \"turtles\" are a part of the gang. They then decide to smash open an ATM machine to buy some food before the fight.</p><p>They later come across Old Hob and the Turtles; before a fight can break out Old Hob attempts to reason with them by stating that they're only slaves to Shredder. Old Hob changes his mind about them joining when they reveal themselves to be half-human. Hob responds by shooting Rocksteady in the face and Bebop in the stomach, thus the fight begins. Rocksteady holds his own and even helps over powers the two teams. He matches Slash in strength and easily swats Mondo Gecko against a wall with his sledgehammer. He sends a car flying with a single blow and removes Slash from the battle in the process. Next he dispatches Leonardo with a single kick, and then throws Raphael and Alopex on top of a building taking them out of the fight as well.</p><p>Rocksteady is dead set on killing Old Hob until Splinter intervenes hitting him and Bebop in sensitive areas. Together with his partner they suffer being electrocuted and is later beaten by a building being collapsed on them. They then leave when they see everyone has left, and Rocksteady asks Bebop to keep their defeat a secret from Karai, in which he agrees to do.</p><h2>Attack on Technodrome</h2><p>The Shredder enters into an alliance with Donatello to attack the Technodrome realizing that Krang is the greatest threat to his one day rule of the planet. However, he doesn't trust Donatello completely, therefore before departing to Burnow Island to confront Krang and his forces. He leaves Rocksteady and Bebop on a special mission to watch over Donatello, warning the Turtle he will have his two henchmen kill him at the first sign of treachery.</p><p>On Burnow Island, Shredder's forces are immediately ambushed, and he engages into a death battle with Krang. Bloody and facing certain death, Krang reveals to Shredder that he was betrayed. Later, he issues the orders to Rocksteady and Bebop to kill Donatello. The fight is rather brief as Rocksteady lands a clean hit with his sledgehammer to Donatello's body. He then engages Metal Head in battle and heavily damages the robot. While Bebop struggles with Donatello, Rocksteady lands the crippling blow to the Turtle, bashing him across his back with the sledgehammer and smashing his shell. Rocksteady and Bebop then walk away leaving the Turtle for dead, as they receive new orders from Karai.</p><h2>Vengeance</h2><p>The Foot Clan are currently in disarray after suffering a huge defeat. Karai names herself leader with the Shredder being thought dead. Rocksteady along with Bebop are attempting to search for Hun whom Karai thinks has deserted them. Karai tries very hard to maintain moral and discipline within the foot, then suddenly Shredder returns with a new plan to kill Splinter after establishing a shaky alliance with Baxter Stockman. Karai sabotages Shredder's plan in order to keep the Foot's honor in place, and thus strikes a deal with Splinter for the Turtles and himself to battle the Shredder and his mutant minions in a tournament called the Gauntlet, where the winning team will face off against the leader of the losing team. Rocksteady and Bebop answer the call to do battle.</p><p>Rocksteady along with Bebop, Koya, and Bludgeon lunge into battle with Rocksteady on the receiving end of Raphael's punishment; with some help from Koya, Rocksteady's team quickly gain the upper hand due to their superior strength. The Turtles regroup and once again Rocksteady suffers more punishment until he and Bebop find themselves strictly facing off against Raphael and Michelangelo. Raphael puts together a plan that sees the two brutes destroying each other in their attempt to kill them. Despite their best efforts, Rocksteady and Bebop have plenty of fight left, plus they see through Raphael's scheme. In a last ditch effort, Donatello in Metal Head's body, self destructs in a kamikaze attack to bring them down, and in the process have his mind restored to his originally body. The two brutes are barely conscious, until Donatello teleports to the battle in his real body and finishes them both off with strong Bo strikes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Skills</h2><p>Rocksteady is very skilled with heavy weapons such as the M-60. He is very strong and his fighting style seems to be brawling as he takes heavy swings at most of his enemies.</p><p><strong>IDW</strong></p><p>Rocksteady is immensely strong and is capable of taking on the entire Turtles team. He carries a sledgehammer and uses his strength for a big advantage. He's a street fighter and is very vicious in a fight. He won't hesitate to use deadly force to kill his enemies. For example, once the opportunity presented itself, he immediately attacked Donatello with his sledgehammer and crippled the Turtle by smashing his shell. So far, Rocksteady appears to be stronger than Bebop. He's able to match Slash in strength and hurl cars with single punches. He is also very durable being able to withstand being shot at close range in the face, take Leonardo's katana blade slices across his arm, shrug off stabbings in the shoulder by Raphael, survive an electrical attack, missile attack, and even a building being dropped on him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Relationships</h2><p>Rocksteady seems think he is on friendly terms with Shredder, but sometimes appears afraid of him. He and Bebop are best friends and are usually never seen not together. He hates the turtles especially Raphael for beating him and Bebop in a fight. He seems to enjoy working for the foot clan, and tolerates their members.</p>",

There is one case of his costume drastically changing though it was due to a satirical commentary on the superhero genre by creator Eric Powell.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Goon Volume One</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">With a wide variety of supernatural beings attacking Lonely Street, Franky and The Goon take to the streets. Armed with their fists, knives, and a talking chainsaw, the duo take down their undead foes and malicious mobsters. When Goon gets captured, Franky forms a rescue party to save his friend.</p><h3>The Goon Volume Two </h3><p>The Zombie Priest and his army are at it again, forcing Franky and The Goon to continue their jobs as the defenders of Lonely Street.

Using the information they obtained from their former friend, the duo head to the <a href=\"/decaster-house/4020-61301/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-61301\">Decaster House</a> in search of some rumored treasure. Though they must combat the spirits of the <a href=\"/decaster-family/4060-62116/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-62116\">Decaster Family</a>, the treasure is located and Franky spends the prize on useless junk! </p><h3>Drawing on your Nightmares</h3><p>Playing more of a minor role, Franky is just seen in the background of Norton's Bar.</p><h3>The Goon Volume Three</h3><p>Franky and The Goon combat even more of the undead after the return of the Zombie Priest. Their pal, the Buzzard, continues to aid the heroes on their quest as they learn more about the Zombie Priests dark past and his plans for the future. However; things start going south once someone who was once loyal to the Goon begins feeding information to the Zombie Priest, resulting in the deaths of several of Goon's pals. Franky also has to help the Goon through his greatest challenge yet when his former lover, <a href=\"/isabella/4005-110900/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-110900\">Isabella</a>, returns to Lonely Street.</p><h3>The Goon: Chinatown and the Mystery of Mister Wicker</h3><p>A look into the past shows a troubled relationship between Franky and The Goon due to the Goon's lover, Isabella. As a new foe known only as <a href=\"/mr-wicker/4005-125211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-125211\">Mr. Wicker</a> enters the scene, Franky does his best to hold onto the territory that he and the Goon still run; however, it becomes increasingly difficult when the Goon tells Franky he's going to quit the business and run away. While the Goon does stay, it comes at quite the cost, as Franky comes into conflict with Isabella.</p><h3>The Goon: Occasion of Revenge</h3><p>The other members of the Zombie Priests species arrive on Lonely Street resulting in an all out war. In the midst of conflict, the Goon finds a new lover who Franky approves of. However; tensions run high when this new lover is revealed to be one of the shape shifting harpy sisters, causing the Goon to enter an emotional state, leaving Franky to try and help him through it all.</p><h3>The Goon: Once Upon a Hard Time</h3><p>In the fallout created due to Goon's past relationship, Franky and the group struggle to fend off their new foes led by <a href=\"/the-arab/4005-110790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-110790\">The Arab</a>. Franky begins to worry about his friend as he spirals further down into depression, seemingly attempting to drink his problems away before he comes to his senses and jumps back into the fight. With the Goon back in action, Franky and the gang are able to defeat the Arab and his allies, allowing Lonely Street to take a break from the chaos for a period of time.</p><h2>Skills &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Franky was originally afraid of conflict; however, after killing his first zombie at a young age he found himself in love with violence, bloodshed, and all things aggressive. Despite his small stature he boasts a high level of strength, agility, and speed, utilizing a scrappy fighting style against his foes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Zorak is the Leader of the Zorathians and sworn enemy of <a href=\"/space-ghost/4005-43703/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43703\"> Space Ghost</a> and his sidekicks <a href=\"/jan/4005-50060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50060\"> Jan</a> and <a href=\"/jayce/4005-50061/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50061\"> Jayce</a>. Zorak can essentially live forever using a hive mind society. If he is killed, his mind and essence would be transferred to another Zorathian who then transforms into exact duplicate of Zorak's original form. The Zorathians follow their leader Lord Zorak and travel from planet to planet to kill the inhabitants and breed in their corpses. While most of the Zorathians are olive green and have two arms, Zorak is green with purple markings and has four arms (two hands and two pincers). In the DC Comics comic book, Zorak wears a suit of armor that he does not wear in any of his other appearances.</p>",

The Zorathians killed their parents and a vast majority of the population leaving them as orphans.  Space Ghost rescued them both, during the invasion Jan and Jayce were cornered by a bunch of the Zorathians and were about to be killed when Space Ghost showed up and fought and killed their tormentors, Space Ghost then fought off the rest of the Zorathians and met his arch-nemesis Zorak in the process. Because Jan and Jayce were now orphans and his own wife and child had been killed, he decided to adopt Jan and Jace and train them as his side-kicks.</p>",

Jayce, Jan and Space Ghost's origins were not revealed until DC's 2005 six-issue miniseries where Space Ghost rescues Jayce and his sister Jan from Zorathians that were atacking their home world.  Space Ghost defeats the invading Zorathians and meets his arch nemesis Zorak for the fist time.  Since both of Jan and Jayce's parents were killed in the invasion, Space Ghost decided to adopt the two orphans and train them as his side-kicks.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Catwoman prowls an area of Gotham known only as the Enclave. The Enclave is known for its extravagant lofts and enterprising businesses. Some of Gotham's most elite citizens reside in the Enclave making Selina's heists all the more profitable. She scopes out one couple who is just sitting down for a romantic candle lit dinner until her concentration was broken by someone breaking into Hendrickson's Jewelry.</p><p>Selina couldn't afford to have some amateur thief trip an alarm within the area so she decides to stop him. Just as she was about to intercept the thief, a gang of kids ambush the thief. The kids start taunting the thief until one of them shoves the thief into a wall causing him to drop his briefcase. When the briefcase fell, it opened and a handful of jewelry scattered across the street. Catwoman decides to cut her losses when a nearby bystander calls out for the police.</p><p>Selina returns to her own loft in the Enclave where her friend Wilder is waiting for her. Selina complains to Wilder about how her latest venture caused her to turn up empty handed. Wilder tells Selina to blow off some steam by going to the gymnasium on the top floor. Selina smiles because she notices her workout clothes are already laid out on her bed. Selina then walks to Wilder while undressing. Selina brushes her fingers across Wilder's chest and asks him if he intended for her to work up a sweat. Wilder smiles right back and says the gymnasium is more or likely vacant so she could practice her acrobatic skills without anyone getting curious.</p><p>Selina raises an eyebrow at Wilder with a smile says \"Hmm...Nice save.\" As she walks away with her tank top and short shorts, Selina turns to Wilder and says \"You know the next time you feel like doing some indoor aerobics, you only have to ask.\" Selina then makes her way to the elevator and Wilder exclaims that he will have a warm bath drawn for her when she returns but only after he takes a cold shower. During her workout, Selina notices the manager of the apartment building escorting a woman who only goes by Ms. Jeffries around the spa.</p><p>Selina's feline instincts tell her that there is something rather off about Ms. Jeffries but she brushes it off for the time being. Selina decides that she wants to get even with the punks who spoiled her caper. Later that night, Selina dresses up as a blonde Enclave aristocrat who is sporting a lot of jewelry. Within an hour of walking around, Selina is finally ambushed by the same gang of punks. The punks try to rob Selina of her jewelry but she turns the table on them by dishing out some of her pain delivering acrobatics.</p><p>The punks run off scared and use a latter attached to the Chiavarelli restaurant to escape. Selina makes her way to the roof of the restaurant, only to be taken by surprise by Zephyr. Zephyr displays her metahuman ability to fly by using the air around her then she discharges a high gust of wind to blow Selina off the rooftop. Fortunately, Selina managed to grab one of the punks by his jacket and when his jacket tore, a token fell from its pockets. The wind blows Selina into an adjacent building and then she falls into an open garbage bin. Selina staggers her to feet and picks up the token that fell from the punk's jacket. She recognizes the coin's origin because she used to use these particular tokens at the now abandoned Happyland Amusement Park. </p><p>The next morning, representatives of Kingsley Tower decide to set up a trap for Catwoman and Zephyr's gang of juvenile thieves in order to put an end to the thefts within the Enclave. Addison Kingsley, the chairman of Kingsley Tower, shows the board members a picture of the Beryl Butterfly, a natural crystal formation made up entirely of precious stones. Kingsley contacts Hendrickson's Jewelry shop and asks them to display the butterfly in their shop and to make  sure its heavily advertised.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zephyr commands her gang to make up for their recent failure by stealing the Beryl Butterfly from Hendrickson's. The leader of the gang just happens to be Ian Hendrickson and he knows how Kingsley Tower is going to transport the butterfly to his father's shop. On the day of the transfer, the boys use a series of gas bombs and other methods of distraction to keep the Tower's security dazed while Ian stole the butterfly from the back of the armored convoy.</p><p>Unfortunately, for Ian, he was unaware of Kingsley's plan and the crystal had a transmitter equipped with it. The transmitter locked on its location at Happyland and Kingsley's private security had the go ahead to use extreme prejudice when retrieving the butterfly. Unbeknownst to Kingsley's security, Catwoman tags along by sitting on top of the armored truck's roof. Selina intends to Kingsley's brute task force before things get bloody for Zephyr's gang.</p><p>Ian gives the butterfly to Zephyr but their moment of success was interrupted by the crashing of Happyland's front gates. Zephyr panics and drops the butterfly. The butterfly shatters and Zephyr realizes it was a glass replica of the original butterfly. Zephyr decides to cut her losses by flying away and abandons the gang. Catwoman makes short work of Kingsley's private security thanks to the gang but one security officer goes after Ian. Ian tries to escape by using the tracks on the old roller coaster but the security officer takes his shot and shoots Ian in the leg. Ian stumbles and falls off the tracks.</p><p>In the end, Ms. Jeffries aka Zephyr was never seen or heard from again. Kingsley was arrested for using lethal force on children. Members of the gang were either reunited with their families or put into the system for foster care. As for Ian, his parents mourned for him as did Catwoman when she placed a bouquet of flowers on his tombstone.  </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Created by Jo Duffy, The wind-controlling Zephyr received lukewarm reception from fans, and was never seen again after her defeat in issue #9.</p>",

    "deck": "Mr. Face is based off another public domain character known as The Face, once published by Colombia Comics. Mr. Face was created by Alex Ross for the Dynamite Comics series \"Project Superpowers\".",
    "description": "<a href=\"/\"> </a> <h2>Creation:</h2> <p>The Face, now known as Mr. Face was originally created by Mart Bailey. The character he created wore a frightening green mask, with flaming red hair, a vampire's white fangs and ghoulish yellow eyes. Underneath the mask was a deep blue tuxedo, which gave him more class. His character when not in costume was a man named Tony Trent. Tony's outgoing personality made him perfect for his job at a broadcasting station. Mark Baily had a great concept for a character with great visual effects, but unfortunately this character didn’t last long in the comic industry. He went from being a Columbia Comics hero in <em>Big Shot Comics</em> and was finally discontinued during his work with the ACE comic company. All of which are now discontinued, for their lack of popularity. Fortunately for him Alex Ross and the Dynamite Entertainment company are bringing him back along with a bunch of other defunct heroes in a new series called <em>Project Superpowers</em>.</p> <p><strong>Ross</strong>: “I always liked the design of a character that has that Creeper-like quality of being a ‘good guy’ Joker. And so the effect of a man with a monster face and a tuxedo is just such a simple, cool idea that I want to take this character and do something with him—where the effect of his face has a surreal quality on people much like Count Vertigo, where it sort of throws you off in a scarecrow-like manner once he enters the room. You’re actually terrorized by the effect of that mask.”</p><a href=\"/\"> </a> <h2>Love Interest</h2> <p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-51050\" href=\"/babs-walsh/4005-51050/\">    Babs Walsh</a> appeared in issue 74 of Big Shot Comics where The Face falls in love. She was Tony Trent's secretary for a while, but later went on to just being his girlfriend.</p><a href=\"/\"> </a> <h2>Origin (1940s):</h2> <p>Tony Trent becomes the Face because he was an announcer for radio station WBSC. He would speak daily of the many terrible things that occur in the town and therefore decided to become a vigilante and help to poor citizens. Avenging the city would be simpler, he thought, if he brought justice while in a mask. He thought criminals scare easily so he wore a grotesque mask to strike terror into their petite hearts. That, he figured, would suffice to startle his opponents, giving him an advantage by immobilizing them for a moment. His idea worked for several months, until the street thugs became accustomed to his face. Then Tony Trent lost the costume and fought unmasked.</p> <p>Tony's appearance is nothing out of the ordinary without the hideous mask. Being a built man with blond hair wont help you stand out in a crowd. This was probably one of the big reasons why people forgot about this once loved character.</p><a href=\"/\"> </a> <h2>Project Superpowers:</h2> <p>In the “Project Superpowers” series the only thing known about Mr. Face is that he was sent into a magical urn that was supposed to be filled with all of the worlds evil and once sent his hope and devotion to become a hero to the world should have stopped the urn's evils from escaping and create a utopia on Earth. Unfortunately this didn't turn out as planned and the world is still full of vile things.</p> <p> In this version of the Face he actually has powers unlike his 40s alter-ego. When he is around any one they experience their worst fears. Even he himself is under the influence of these powers, fearing that he’ll never be able to take of his mask. <br /> </p><h2>The Canadian Legion (Arcana Studio)<br /></h2> In the Canadian Legion series by Arcana Studio, the Face makes an appearance as a criminal mastermind. After years of trying to change the system, Tony Trent becomes a Socialist terrorist, the mask he wears is one of 6 Masks of Sin and it has completely corrupted him. Once an ally of The Black Terror, the Face in the CL universe is now his most hated enemy.<br /><p>   <br /><br /></p> <p><br /></p>",

    "description": "<p>Bass was the very first Auto-Navi..... becoming one of the few navi's not to have an owner. However, after being falsely accused for causing problems in the 'Net he was hunted down and nearly deleted, Since then he has sought to increase in any way possible in order to torment humanity seeking to someday gain his revenge against all of humanity.</p><p> He wants to destroy any Navi that relies on a human, or possibly convert them to his side. He thinks that the computer programs are much more powerful and efficient than the human race, and that they need to separate themselves and stop calling one another \"partners\". It was his hate for Navis' ties to humanity that caused him to hate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49077\" href=\"/megamanexe/4005-49077/\" slug=\"megamanexe\">Megaman.EXE</a> and his operator <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49080\" href=\"/lan-hikari/4005-49080/\" slug=\"lan-hikari\">Lan Hikari</a>. After many fights Bass still remains Megaman.EXE's greatest foe growing stronger each time they've met. Although he hates Lan and Megaman he has grown to respect their power and fighting abilities.</p>",

Following with the orders, the Monitor contracted assassins for hire and outfitted them after chosen Greek and Roman archetypes. One of these assassins become known as Argus, acting as the communications expert due to his ability to see a short distance into the future, granting him abilities somewhat like <a href=\"/argus/4005-4145/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4145\">his namesake</a>. He was then made a member of Maxie Zeus' team, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-olympians/4060-50034/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50034\">New Olympians</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Argus and the rest of the New Olympians were created by writer Mike W. Barr, along with artists Bill Anderson and Bill Willingham. He first appeared in 1984's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-and-the-outsiders/4050-3194/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3194\"><em>Batman and the Outsiders</em></a> #14.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Olympics</h3><p>Argus and his fellow New Olympians arrived at the Olympics to abduct athlete Lacinia Nitocris and convince her to be Maxie Zeus' bride. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/outsiders/4060-5704/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5704\">Outsiders </a>confronted them however, and Maxie Zeus demanded that the teams compete against each other in deadly Olympic style games to determine the fate of Nitocris.</p><p>Argus’ sole role during the games was to watch the matches and relay the results to Zeus and Batman. Ultimately however the Outsiders proved victorious over the New Olympians.</p><h3>Thy Kingdom Come</h3><p>The New Olympians went into hiding, and only resurfaced when they were all found dead in their subterranean hideout. Their death wound up being part of a murder spree perpetrated by <a href=\"/william-matthews/4005-50989/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50989\">Gog</a>, who believed he had a preordained purpose in life to destroy false gods.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Argus has the metahuman power to telepathically follow events from great distances and a limited ability to see into the future.</p>",

The insulin turbo-charged Michael's metabolism, resulting in his super speed.<br/><br/>After gaining his powers he set out to become <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2901\" href=\"/prime/4005-2901/\" slug=\"prime\">Prime</a>'s teenage sidekick. Ironically Michael is actually a few years older than Kevin. The two became friends and battled many foes together, including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48536\" href=\"/doc-gross/4005-48536/\" slug=\"doc-gross\">Doc Gross</a>.<br/><br/>Later Michael revealed to Kevin that he was gay, and loved him. At first Prime didn't know how to react to the news, but later accepted it. He then revealed his Secret ID to Michael.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Dr. Rex Ward was a 25th-century scientist who used a time machine to travel to 1941. Stepping from the time machine, he was murdered. He was denied entry to Heaven for being a man who died before he was born. As a ghost, he is charged with the duty to fight supernatural evil.</p><h2>Publishing History</h2><p>It should be noted, in real life, that the character was created for the fanzine comic <em>Star-Studded Comics</em>, where he was the most popular superhero. Howard Keltner, creator of Dr. Weird and one of The Texas Trio (creators of <em>Star-Studded</em>) sold the rights to the character to Gary Carlson of <em>Big Bang Comics</em> and Ed DeGeorge.</p><h3>Inspiration</h3><p>Despite similarities to Marvel Comics' Doctor Strange, Aarkus, and DC Comics' Spectre, the character was inspired by Mr. Justice from MLJ (Archie Comics).</p>",

Temari is the oldest and she uses a fan as a weapon and wind <a href=\"/jutsu/4015-50943/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50943\"> jutsus</a>. Kankuro is the second oldest and he is a puppet master using puppets that carry weapons and traps. Gaara is the youngest and by far the weirdest and strongest. He sealed the <a href=\"/legendary-tailed-beasts/4060-54828/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54828\"> Ichibi</a> in the infant Gaara, but his wife and Gaara's mother died as a result. After this he harbored anger and resentment towards Gaara whom he perceived as nothing but a monster, and tried to have his son killed six times.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually the village entered hard times.

However Orochimaru betrayed him, killing him and his escorts and assuming his identity to complete his plan.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually he would be resurrected by Orochimaru's right hand, <a href=\"/kabuto-yakushi/4005-44523/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44523\"> Kabuto</a>, whom attained Orochimaru's powers. He'd be forced to fight in the 4th ninja world war and would be confronted by his son, Gaara. He was shocked to not only find out that Gaara was his successor as Kazekage, but also that Gaara had friends. He remembered back to when Gaara was young. Gaara was the most suitable host yet, but even he was starting to lose control. The 4th Kazekage became concerned over the village's safety and the village's loss of power without a skilled host. Back in the present, the two fought, but Gaara was able to overcome the gold's weight quicker than he thought and was able to bind all of the Kages, with the exception of <a href=\"/muu/4005-75680/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75680\"> Muu</a>. The sand took the form of Gaara's mother holding them, which caused the 4th to become emotional and confess that Gaara's mother always loved him, and vowed as she died to protect him.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers/Abilities</h2><p> </p><p>He possessed the ability to alter his chakra into magnetic fields to control metallic items, same as his <a href=\"/third-kazekage/4005-49819/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49819\"> predecessor</a>. He uses this to control gold dust in a similar fashion to Gaara's sand, but he also used this to neutralize the Ichibi when it broke free by using the gold to weigh down the Ichibi's sand.</p>",

    "deck": "Superman's villain. Two versions have appeared: first was an unknown man and the second is Valerie Van Haaften.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Puzzler originally operates a business in <a href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis</a> which consists of extorting people if they don't pay him for protection, and in this way eventually crosses paths with <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>. The Puzzler is quite adept at parlor games and puzzles, using both of these in various way to gain the upper hand against Superman.</p><p>Once the character is revamped as Valerie Van Haaften, the new Puzzler first appears as an enormous Superman fan, and as a plan to gain his attention joins numerous groups dedicated to super heroes. This idea fails which leads the Puzzler to go down the road of committing crimes, and later accepts a job to assassinate Clark Kent.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Puzzler was created by <a href=\"/jerry-siegel/4040-40754/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40754\">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href=\"/john-sikela/4040-46799/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-46799\">John Sikela</a> for use in DC comics, the character first appeared in <a href=\"/action-comics-the-wizard-of-chance/4000-113017/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-113017\">Action Comics #49</a> in 1942. The character was eventually revised for the character Valerie Van Haaften who first appeared in <a href=\"/superman-ending-battle-part-5-after-school-special/4000-119291/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-119291\"><i>Superman</i> Vol. 2, #187</a> in 2002.</p><h2>The First Puzzler</h2><p>In <i>Action Comics #49</i>, the Puzzler was a man who used his amazing cheating skills to win almost any game and was also in the business of blackmail and extortion. He kidnaps <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a> many times and forces Superman play for her freedom. The Puzzler always cheats but Superman notices it and was able to turn the tables on him in a game of checkers by using his super-speed to cheat and give the Puzzler a taste of his own medicine. Rather than give up the Puzzler attempts to escape.</p><p>The second time he returns in a card game championship as a masked player. Though skillful, he is bested in every game. The Puzzler wants ironic revenge. He is only able to kill one champion, the poker champion. He beat him to death with a fireplace poker. The others (the bridge player who he tries to throw of a bridge; the hearts player to have a heart attack; the rummy champion to die of poisoned rum; the casino player killed in a casino) were saved by Superman. He then followed Puzzler to his hideout and while avoiding his traps, captured the criminal.</p><h2>The Second Puzzler</h2><p>Valerie Van Haaften, the second Puzzler first appeared in <i>Superman Vol. 2, #187</i>. She is a huge fan of Superman and in an attempt to get his attention tries joining several superhero organizations. In the end she went for the criminal way. The Puzzler's first task was to kill <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Clark Kent</a>. She was hired by the <a href=\"/intergang/4060-41506/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41506\">Intergang</a> but when she saw Superman she saw an opportunity to get to the top by killing him. She was almost able to defeat Superman until he separated her puzzle pieces, leaving her unable to pull herself back together. Next time she attacked the <a href=\"/secret-six/4060-38149/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-38149\">Secret Six</a> along with many other villains to get the <a href=\"/get-out-of-hell-free-card/4055-55792/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55792\">Get out of Hell Free Card</a>. Like the others, she failed.</p><h2>The New 52</h2><p>In Justice League of America #3, The Puzzler is seen working for ARGUS. He is male and assumed to be the orginal incarnation. He is working on a slate shingle that dates back to the early 1800's and shards from a stained glass window. He is reassembling them to see what the images mean.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2651933\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2651933-867907_puzzler___evans_edit_medium.jpg\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2651933-867907_puzzler___evans_edit_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2651933\"><img alt=\"The Puzzler on 1960's Batman TV series\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2651933-867907_puzzler___evans_edit_medium.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2651933-867907_puzzler___evans_edit_medium.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></a><figcaption>The Puzzler on 1960's Batman TV series</figcaption></figure><p>A version of the Puzzler made an appearance in two episodes on the 1960's Batman television series played by Maurice Evans as a potential replacement for <a href=\"/riddler/4005-3718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\">the Riddler</a> but the character never made another appearance.</p><p>The Puzzler is also mentioned in the movie <a href=\"/batman-forever/4025-8/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-8\">Batman Forever</a>, as a possible super-villain nickname for the character of Edward Nygma, but ultimately the name \"The Riddler\" is chosen.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>The first Puzzler didn't have any powers, but he was a great cheater and a experienced games-man, especially concerning parlor and board games such as checkers.</p><p>The second Puzzler's (Valerie Van Haaften) power consists of little puzzle pieces that are incapable of being destroyed, which she can control, throw, and propel at the same speed as bullets from a gun.</p>",

Vilgax was first seen attacking <a href=\"/xylene/4005-50332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50332\">Xylene</a>'s spaceship in an attempt to retrieve the Omnitrix from her ship. He was severally injured in the attack and was confined to a regeneration tank for much of the first season and would often send drones or bounty hunters to attack Ben and retrieve the Omnitrix. When he came out of the tank his body was modified to increase his physical structure. Vilgax finds Ben and and kidnaps him and attempts to steal the Omnitrix. He is rescued by <a href=\"/maxwell-tennyson/4005-49095/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49095\">Grandpa</a> and <a href=\"/gwen-tennyson/4005-55806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55806\">Gwen</a> and battles Vilgax on top of <a href=\"/the-rushmore-sanctuary/4020-56314/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56314\">Mout.

He also has absorbed all their abilities making him much more powerful than earlier. He came to earth to challenge Ben to a duel. He had some new abilities like locking laser, flight, a sword, shield and was much stronger than before, enough to defeat a fully grown Humongosaur in one hit. He ultimately lost to Diamond head.</p><p>He then teamed up with Zs'Skayr and learnt about Primus. He ended up growing giant on Primus after falling into a DNA pool only to loose once again to Way Big.</p><p>In Final Battle, he teamed up with Albedo. It was revealed that Vilgax's true habitat was water where he transforms into his true form, a giant octopus like creature. He was caught in a huge explosion caused by Ultimate Swamp Fire and was presumed dead.</p><p><strong>Ultimate Alien</strong></p><p>Vilgax was presumed dead for a long time until Ben found out that he was posing as Diagon, an extra dimensional god. A group called Flame's Keppers were worshiping him and helping him heal.</p><p>Later he got Ascalon and freed Diagon by breaking the seal. He returned with a completely new appearance, a lot like Lucubras.

In his upgraded cyber-form, his strength and power is so great he once crushed one of the heads of Mount Rushmore with a single blow, and he is also so durable Diamondhead smashed his own fists punching Vilgax, and Vilgax was barely even hurt, and he also withstood the impact of XLR8 charging into him at full speeds and Vilgax showed no signs of pain or injury from the impact, it merely damaged XLR8.

    "deck": "Dr. James Aloysius Animo is a twisted genetic scientist who creates mutated forms of animals and is a common villain to Ben 10.",
    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Animo used to be a promising scientist until it was found he was performing twisted experiments on a animals. He was driven mad when he didn't get an award called the Verties Award. He uses a device called the Transmodulator to mutate animal DNA. He first met Ben when he attempted to get revenge on Dr. Kelly the man who got the Verties Award and looking for parts to complete his Transmodulator. He was able to finish the Transmodulator and went into the second phase of his work, reanimating dead cells. He attacked Kelly with a resurrected T-Rex, but was defeated by Ben.</p><h2>Dr Animo's return</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dr Animo returns and takes over an abandoned observatory and constructs his Transmodular. He then uses his intelligence and equipment to track down Ben and his friends and sought revenge with them. Ben and his friends were celebrating a happy festival and Max notices something wrong with the animals. Suddenly, a large mutated frog leaps out of nowhere and begins to attack the Ben and the rest of the audience there. Ben immediately recognizes the frog as one of Dr Animo's pets and then decides to use the omnitrix. However, Ben messed up with the omnitrix before the attack came which caused the front cover of the omnitrix to fall off. Without the cover, Ben was unable to transform into one whole being as the front cover shows the alien image. The omnitrix creates Stinkarms, an alien which has the wings and the head of Stinkfly and the body of Fourarms. Ben reckons he had unlocked a new alien and uses his new form to defeat the mutated frog. The frog jumps on top of Ben as the frog wanted to squash Ben. Ben lifts the frog up but realizes that he was no longer as strong as before which caused the large frog to squash Ben. Ben then tries to fly but his weight was too heavy. Ben eventually punches the mutated frog which caused the frog to hit Dr Animo. Dr Animo then discovers a piece of the omnitrix and orders his pet to take him back to the observatory. Ben then reveals to Gwen and Max that he had broke the omnitrix by accident.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dr Animo then decides to use the front cover of the omnitrix as his source of power. He then powers up his Transmodular and sees a bat nearby and uses the Transmodualr on the bat which mutates the bat and turns the bat into a Heatblast bat. He then commands the bat to ambush Ben and his friends but Ben transforms into a weird alien combination called Diamond Matter. Ben, with the help of his close friends, defeats the Heatblast bat and follows the Heatblast bat to the observatory. Ben demands back the fragments of the omnitrix but Dr Animo refuses. Dr Animo claims that the fragment of the omnitrix is a piece of valuable technology and the potential power of it is virtually unlimited. He then empowers the Transmodular and fires it at Ben but <a href=\"/maxwell-tennyson/4005-49095/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49095\" data-mce-href=\"/maxwell-tennyson/4005-49095/\">Maxwell Tennyson</a> takes the blast instead and mutates Max. Dr Animo fires another blast at Ben's altered state and was proven immune to Dr Animo's Transmodular.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ben then transforms into a Ripjaw-Heatblast being. He struggled to defeat Dr Animo's pets at first but gets used to it when he is in water. Ben wounds the Heatblast bat and the mutated frog and challenges Dr Animo. Gwen secretly sneaks into the Transmodular cannon and steals the fragment of the omnitrix which depowered the Transmodular. Dr Animo then tries to get back the fragment but was knocked out by Ben. Gwen then returns Max back to noramal by turning the fragment upside down which negates the Transmodular's previous effect on Max. Ben then sticks the cover of the omnitrix back on before he turns back human again and the fragment sticks on.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He later appears having escaped from Alcatraz Island. He kidnaped Ben when he discovered a new self-replicating alien named Ditto. Animo combined Ditto's DNA with Stinkfly's to create an army of self-replicating giant insects. However Ben was able to destroy them when he relised that like Ditto they would feel each others pain and if he destroyed one they would all die. Ben defeated Animo's army and sent him back to prison.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dr Animo built a machine which allowed him to travel to the future and Dr Animo built himself an ape suit. He was increasing his power until Gwendolin, Gwen's future form, brings Ben and Gwen to the future and wants them to defeat the all-powered Dr Animo. Dr Animo then attacks Future Ben and claims that he would use the DNA structures in the alien room and create an army of powerful aliens. He easily defeats Future Ben and Ben himself and breaks the container which holds Vilgax. Dr Animo then uses his advanced technology and brings Vilgax back to full form again. Dr Animo then tries to open the Null Void but was stopped by Future Gwen and Gwen. Dr Animo tried to escape, but failed as Gwen stepped onto one of his connectors.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><ins><strong>Ben 10 Alien Force </strong></ins></p><figure style=\"width: 883px\" data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114602/3501568-7801488034-DAV7..PNG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3501568\" data-ratio=\"0.73952434881087\" data-width=\"883\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114602/3501568-7801488034-DAV7..PNG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3501568\"><img alt=\"D'Void\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111114602/3501568-7801488034-DAV7..PNG\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114602/3501568-7801488034-DAV7..PNG 883w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111114602/3501568-7801488034-DAV7..PNG 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>D'Void</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ben went to Null void after receiving a call from Helen.
