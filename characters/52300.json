He first appeared after the relaunch of 2011 and was created by <a href=\"/tony-daniel/4040-4663/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4663\">Tony Daniel</a>.</p><h2>Story arc</h2><p>The Xenusians were a race of malevolent aliens who spread a mysterious plague that caused the victims to mutate and transforms into new Xenusians. Also, the Xenusians were responsible for the annihilation of the entire Vexaphon race.</p><p>Morphicius spread the Xenuisan plague across the galaxy until he was captured by a mysterious High Council, who sentenced him to imprisonment to a containment vessel. Eventually, Morphicius's containment vessel fell to Earth, and he spent hundreds of years in cryogenic stasis until his vessel was found by <a href=\"/professor-ziegler/4005-80659/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80659\">Professor Ziegler</a>'s research team. One scientist, Terrance, was secretly working for Hogarth Kane, a military official who sought to obtain the vessel for military use, opened the tomb, awakening Morphicius and releasing the plague. In a matter of moments, the plague mutates the scientists and turns them into Xenusians. Hawkman arrives and kills two Xenusians until Morphicius personally fights Hawkman, absorbing some of his lifeforce. Morphicius then grows his own <a href=\"/nth-metal/4055-47346/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-47346\">Nth Metal</a> armor.</p><p>As the fight continues, Morphicius gains the advantage, until Hawkman dissipates his armor and prepares to fight him on his own, saying that he has nothing to lose. Morphicius simply replies that Hawkman has indeed something to lose, just not yet, and flies away.</p><p>As he flies across Manhattan, Morphicius loses control of the Nth metal and falls to a secluded alley. There, he finds a mysterious man who identifies himself as Waker, the last Vexaphon. Although Morphicius attacks him, Waker tells him that he has been sent to save his life.</p><p>Waker takes the weakened Morphicius to the Non-Lethal Alternative Studios building, where Kane's research team begins performing experiments to get better data from Morphicius' physology as they perform an autopsy on him and then fells unconscious. Upon waking Kane introduces himself saying that's aware about the nature of the Xenusians and states that will find a way to control Morphicius's power and take profit from it as he swears vengeance on Kane,while being vivisected by <a href=\"/askana/4005-80662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80662\">Askana</a>.</p><p>Hours later, the vivisection ends and Morphicius has been cut to pieces, leaving only his head. Kane orders Askana to dispose of Morphicius's head when Hawkman arrives, having discovered Kane's involvement in Morphicius's release. Hawkman had also brought Terrance with him.</p><p>While Hawkman fought Askana, Terrance, who had been infected with Morphicius's plague, reaches Morphicius's disembodied head and merges it with his own body, and Morphicius is fully reborn.</p><p>After a prolonged fight, Hawkman discovers Morphicius's weakness to cold, so he grabs tube containing liquid nitrogen and shoots Morphicius with it, freezing him for ice, hopefully for good.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p><strong>Superhuman Strength</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Superhuman Durability</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Superhuman Stamina</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Claws: </strong>His claws are sharp enough to shred concrete,steel and even the NTH metal.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/120679/4113726-thesavagehawkman_4_thegroup_004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4113726\" data-ratio=\"1.4985994397759\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/120679/4113726-thesavagehawkman_4_thegroup_004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4113726\"><img alt=\"Shredding Nth Metal\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120679/4113726-thesavagehawkman_4_thegroup_004.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120679/4113726-thesavagehawkman_4_thegroup_004.jpg 357w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120679/4113726-thesavagehawkman_4_thegroup_004.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Shredding Nth Metal</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p><strong>Shape-Shifting:</strong> Morphicius is also capable of morphing his body, such as turning one arm into a axe  or sickle to attack Hawkman.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/120679/4113378-morphy_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4113378\" data-ratio=\"1.4432029795158\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/120679/4113378-morphy_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4113378\"><img alt=\"Absorbing the Nth metal.\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120679/4113378-morphy_1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120679/4113378-morphy_1.jpg 1074w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/120679/4113378-morphy_1.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/120679/4113378-morphy_1.jpg 665w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/120679/4113378-morphy_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Absorbing the Nth metal.</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Energy Absorption:</strong> Morphicius' main capability is absorb any type of energy.

    "deck": "Jaina Hudson is a Batman villainess who can split herself into two separate bodies, one of whom is her pathological alter-ego the White Rabbit.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Jaina Hudson's father was an American diplomat assigned to <a href=\"/india/4020-55919/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55919\">India</a>, where he met and married her eventual mother, a Bollywood actress. Jaina was raised in <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham</a> at private schools since she was nine. She met <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Bruce Wayne</a> at a charity function to raise funds for relief in <a href=\"/pakistan/4020-55955/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55955\">Pakistan</a>. The two later began dating, and the mysterious White Rabbit (Jaina's pathological duplicate form) made her first appearance during a prisoner breakout from <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The White Rabbit was created in 2011 by David Finch and Paul Jenkins to be a sexy new villainess for <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> in their <a href=\"/the-new-52/4015-56061/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56061\">New 52</a> reboot series, <a href=\"/batman-the-dark-knight/4050-42719/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42719\">Batman: The Dark Knight</a>. The character's first appearance (both as Jaina Hudson and as the White Rabbit) was in issue #1. The two were later revealed to be the same character in issue #7.</p><p> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Batman: The Dark Knight</h3><p>Jaina Hudson first met Bruce Wayne during a charity fund-raising party. Bruce was immediately attracted to her; they flirted with each other and agreed to go on a date. However, Bruce's commitments as Batman prevented him from seeing her.</p><p>The mysterious White Rabbit then appeared during a breakout of <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum</a>. She taunted Batman and the <a href=\"/gotham-city-police-department/4060-42090/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42090\">Gotham City Police Department</a> before escaping through the corridors. It soon became clear that Batman had never witnessed the woman before, and the others he spoke to about her remained skeptical of her existence (including <a href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Commissioner Gordon</a> and <a href=\"/two-face/4005-5555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\">Two-Face</a>, neither of whom had previous knowledge of her). Batman had his butler <a href=\"/alfred/4005-5556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5556\">Alfred Pennyworth</a> attempt to locate her while he tracked down and detained the other escapees. Responding to a tip-off about the location of the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a>, Batman entered a speeding train to find a host of dead clown thugs. He also found the alluring White Rabbit, but she continued to taunt him and challenged him to chase her. Batman chased her for answers, but when he finally located her again in another compartment, she was lounging with the Joker, implying that the two were working together and that she may have been responsible for the Arkham breakout.</p><p>Naturally a fight broke out between Batman and the \"Joker,\" the latter of whom turned out to be the shape-shifting villain <a href=\"/clayface-karlo/4005-9589/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9589\">Clayface</a> in disguise. After the reveal Batman was able to knock out Clayface, who toppled and landed on Batman, pinning him to the floor. While the hero was trapped, the White Rabbit sensually stroked his face as she prepared to inject him with an unknown substance (possibly the same anti-fear toxins she had infected Arkham's escapees with). She was interrupted by the arrival of <a href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">the Flash</a>. The White Rabbit fled the scene and once again was able to escape capture.</p><p>Although her intentions are still unknown, she was later seen working for the super-villain <a href=\"/bane/4005-6129/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6129\">Bane</a> and injecting new toxins into other super-villains. A short while later it was revealed that Jaina (who was now informally dating Bruce Wayne) and the White Rabbit are in fact the same person.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/2745828-whiterabbit_splitting_tdk7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2745828\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.95\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/2745828-whiterabbit_splitting_tdk7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2745828\"><img alt=\"Her two bodies separated\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29837/2745828-whiterabbit_splitting_tdk7.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/2745828-whiterabbit_splitting_tdk7.jpg 620w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29837/2745828-whiterabbit_splitting_tdk7.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Her two bodies separated</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Duplication</strong></p><p>Jaina Hudson can physically separate the White Rabbit persona from herself and thus be in two different places at once. Adding to the confusion, her two separate bodies seem to exhibit distinctly different personalities, and even their appearance is markedly different: Jaina has olive skin, dark hair, and green eyes, while the White Rabbit has pale skin, platinum hair, and pink eyes. It has not been revealed exactly how her duplication power works, though it appears to be linked in some way to the White Rabbit's gloves.</p><p><strong>Agility</strong></p><p>The White Rabbit is remarkably quick and agile, being able to effortlessly outrun most pursuers (including Batman) even while wearing her trademark thigh-high boots with long spiked heels.</p><p><strong>Stamina</strong></p><p>The White Rabbit exhibits virtually no fatigue when running and never appears winded. While running at full speed, she routinely taunts pursuers with \"catch me if you can\" and similar phrases as they struggle to keep up.</p><p><strong>Escape Artist</strong></p><p>The White Rabbit has also demonstrated considerable skill at evasion, escaping numerous times from Gotham Police and even Batman himself.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<h2><strong>Biography:</strong></h2><p>Scott McCall was a kid who played lacrosse and had asthma before the fateful evening he was bitten by a werewolf. It was the last day of summer before his buddy Stiles told him that there was a dead body in the Beacon Hills Woods. However it was revealed that it was only half of the body that was found by the Beacon Hills police. Stiles is found by his father who is the local sheriff, but Scott got away before he tumbled and lost his inhaler. Scott used his cell phone to try and find it, but he was soon bitten by a wolf and in fear, he found himself on a street outside the woods and nearly run over by a car. The next morning before school started, Scott removed a very large bandage on the side of his body. His bite was completely healed and he soon realized that there was something else different about him. His asthma was gone and he could hear things from  very far away.</p><p>Scott told his friend Stiles about it and Stiles jokingly stated that Scott has something called lycanthropy. Something that Scott didn't believe, but Stiles started doing more and more research and he is soon convinced that Scott is a werewolf. Eventually Scott comes to grips with that, but soon learns the dangers of being a werewolf especially under a full moon. Scott however learns that there is another werewolf in Beacon Hills named Derek Hale. Who lost most of his family years ago when his house was set on fire and most of his family was trapped. There were a few survivors including himself because he was away, his older sister Laura, younger sister Cora, and his uncle Peter who was caught in the fire, but entered into a coma. Derek tried to teach Scott how to use his powers, but Scott neither trusted him or even liked him.</p><p>Besides Derek and his new abilities, Derek has to continue to look out for the rogue werewolf and a group of hunters who hunt his kind. Scott even begins dating one of the hunter's daughter named Allison, who he flat out refuses to allow him to date her or even let her date Scott. Scott on the other hand eventually learns that the werewolf who bit him was Derek's uncle, who recovered from his injuries and had been faking it. He killed Derek's sister Laura for her power to become an Alpha. As he wanted to avenge his family and kill the one responsible for murdering most of his family which turned out to be Kate Argent.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Personality:</strong></h2><p>Scott starts out as a socially awkward kid in high school trying to find himself, but as his powers begin to reshape his life, his personality changes. While still a bit socially distant, he does become much more confident in his life. As a werewolf, Scott will never kill an innocent life and he wants to use his power to help people much to many werewolf's and even many hunter's frustration. </p><p> </p>",

After some hesitation, Dick decides to visit his old circus, and when he gets there, he sees his old friend Raya, a fellow acrobat who rejoined the circus sometime after Dick left. Seeing Dick for the first time in years, Raya equally as happy to see her old friend, teasing him about his looks, while showing some clear affections towards him and trying to get him to go up on the trapeze for old time's sake.</p><p>Following Dick's battle with <a href=\"/saiko/4005-79618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79618\">Saiko</a>, Raya arrives at Grayson's apartment just as he was about to leave for \"patrol\" for the second time that night. She asks him to escort her to <a href=\"/atlantic-city/4020-57770/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57770\">Atlantic City</a> because she has no method of transportation. She has some urgency in this, but she doesn't mention why she needs to head to Atlantic City. Dick then borrows one of <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Bruce Wayne's</a> jets and she reveals that the reason she wants to go to Atlantic City is because <a href=\"/cc-haly/4005-80615/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80615\">Mr. Haly</a> is dying and wants to talk with Dick. On the ride back, the two grow closer to each other and end up having intimate relations on the jet. Following the funeral of Mr. Haly she informs Dick that one of their old friends is presently living in Chicago arranging contracts on peoples lives. After Dick returns from this confrontation in Chicago, he visits Raya, informing that he is not afraid to face his past anymore and that he is going to involve himself more with Haly's Circus, after this the two apparently bond in a romantic manner.</p><p>She is involved in the plot with <a href=\"/saiko/4005-79618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79618\">Saiko</a> against Dick Grayson.</p><h3>Death of the Family</h3><p><b>For more information see: <a href=\"/death-of-the-family/4045-56853/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56853\">Death of the Family</a></b></p><p>Raya has been broken out of <a href=\"/blackgate-penitentiary/4020-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56051\">Blackgate Penitentiary</a> by the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a>, and taken to Kline Industries' closed aerospace factory. There the Joker injects her with a Laughing gas formula and dresses her up to look like Nightwing. When Nightwing arrives Raya has succumb to the toxic and attacks Nightwing, while Joker watches. After the Joker leaves, Nightwing is able to inject Raya with an antidote that brings Raya back to her senses. But it's too late and she dies in Nightwing's arms. Her last words were \"I'm sorry.\" Before Nightwing chases after the Joker he notices something written on Raya's stomach, it's an invitation to Joker's surprise party at Haly's Circus.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Raya is a normal human with no known superpowers. Raya is presumably in an above average physical condition when compared to the normal human, due to her occupation as an acrobat in Haly's Circus, but is otherwise completely normal.</p>",

After Wildman and Canada come back from space, Mother talks to her due to the nanocites inside her.</p><h2>History</h2><p>A member of the New 52 Blackhawk team, Nikki Nemzer, there is not much background on the character yet. Kunoichi is a main field operative who became infected with nanocites during an operation and being bit by an enemy pilot. Apparently, against orders, she breached the perimeter during this mission and ended up having to be extracted by a few other members of the Blackhawks' initiative. Though the Blackhawks were supposed to hold clandestine operations, someone was able to capture a picture of both the Blackhawk symbol and Kunoichi upon her extraction. She became \"the face of the Blackhawks\" and \"famous\" as a result.</p><p>The team, both inactive and active members, recuperated Kunoichi's nanocites get discovered. She was quarantined until further investigation and/or medical analysis could be provided. During this time, Titus (who was captured and unsuccessfully interrogated by the Blackhawks) managed to get free of the Blackhawks containment once the power momentarily shutdown. Kunoichi, coupled with the nanocites' ability to rapidly repair her body, was the only person who could confront Titus once the Eyrie became radioactive and successfully took him down using her nanocite abilities.</p><p>Eventually reinstated on the active team, Kunoichi and rest of the Blackhawks became focused on taking down a new threat who had detonated explosives at the Eyrie, killing Wildman. Matteo Bischoff. The entire team, including Andrew Lincoln, moved to take on this threat. Kunoichi, Attila, and Irishman infiltrated the base and Kunoichi was able to confront Bischoff but was almost completely taken out by nanocites that operated like nerve gas. She was saved by Canada but had her body taken over my Mother Machine.</p><p>Back at the Blackhawks' base, the Eyrie, Mother Machine attempted to use Kunoichi's body to destroy the base and kill all of the Blackhawks, but was highly unsuccessful. Mother Machine was trapped inside of the base, linked to the mainframe and was blown up as a result of some coolants and things being shutdown, leaving the power sources and nuclear reactor inside to overheat and explode.</p><p>All of the Blackhawks escape and are left to figure out what their next move is.</p><p>Kunoichi was in a relationship with fellow teammate Wildman until his death. The two have confrontations that lead to Kunoichi avoiding Wildman for weeks at a time until whenever. It was on and off.</p><p>While on bed rest she revealed to Irishman that when she was young she wanted to be famous. She also reveals that she even tried out for a Japanese pop-idol group called Team A.</p>",

    "description": "<h2><b>Origin</b></h2><p>Mother Machine was a lieutenant in the <a href=\"/blackhawks/4050-42975/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42975\">Blackhawks</a> when she was captured by <a href=\"/parademons/4060-57182/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57182\">Parademons</a> during <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a>'s invasion, with the intent of turning her into a living weapon. While the Blackhawks were able to rescue her before the transformation was complete, she was not the woman they once knew. Her mind was changed, taking on a computer like personality, and had been turned into a cyborg, giving her the ability to manipulate and create 'nanocites' and control machines.</p><h2><strong>Reunion with the Blackhawks</strong></h2><p>Five years later, she would have a run in with her former employers again, now as a villain and adversary in charge of a vast underground empire for them to defeat. They believe her dead, but she has backed up her mind on computers around the world, and vowed to return to carry out her plans.</p><h2><strong>Clash With The Metal Men</strong></h2><p>Having been taken up by the United States Government <a title=\"William Magnus (Prime Earth)\" href=\"/will-magnus/4005-9536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9536\">Dr. Will Magnus</a> and his <a title=\"Metal Men (Prime Earth)\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/metal-men/4060-5712/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5712\">Metal Men</a> acted as a response team against a host of robotics crisis engineered by a hacker aliased as <a title=\"Noah Kuttler (Prime Earth) (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/calculator/4005-2545/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2545\">Nameless</a> who wanted the secrets to they're <a title=\"Responsometer\" href=\"/responsometer/4055-55710/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55710\">Responsometer</a>'s. Unbeknownst to everyone however, the enigmatic cyber-terrorist was in league with then thought deceased Mother Machine who was the real mastermind behind his actions. As she was actually after the metal men's ability to function properly outside of the internet.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3><b>Nanocitic Artificial Intelligence</b></h3><p>Due to having been altered by Apokoliptian technologies the entity who came to be known as Mother machine now sports a host of mechanomorphing capabilities, her body is largely made up of memory downloading technorganic micro machines that enable her to store her information, her entire consciousness and transfer it over the WWW and recreate her physical form from scratch as many times as need be.</p><p><b>Technomorphing</b>: Unlike most technopaths, Mother can assimilate and reformat any kind of technology into himself as well as cast her own will into it controlling, alternating and reformatting both it and herself into a host of different forms.</p><ul><li><strong>Computer</strong><b> Interfacing</b></li><li><b>Interactive Holographic Projector</b></li><li><b>Cyberspace/Digiverse immersion</b></li></ul><p><b>Nanocyte Manipulation</b>: Mother has the ability to procreate and generate a series of microscopic nano-robotic drones which allow her to infest and manipulate matter from a molecular-subatomic scale. Allowing her to fabricate entire technologically advance cities which change according the the thoughts and desires of those who they pick the brainwaves from.</p><ul><li><strong>Shape-Change</strong>: Mother Machine has complete and total control over her components allowing her to change and morph any technology she has on hand into whatever she desires at will.</li><li><b>Omni-Fabrication</b>: Her nanocites enable Mother to </li><li><b>Infection</b>: Mother can bestow portions of her Micro Machines onto another being enabling them a host of post-human physical capabilities.</li></ul><h3><b>Internet Manipulation</b></h3><p>Mother machine is a synergystic human-Artificial Intelligence, a living binary consciousness able to move to and from any computer system in the world. Being a central modem of the global network all her own, through this she can download and store the very life essence of herself and others to be recreated at a later date or exert her control over nay and all electronic devices from a remote location at will. </p><p><b>Information Manipulation:</b> Mother can store, repurpose and utilize whatever data &amp; knowledge gleaned from a subject stored on her nanobionics at will, storing personal identity to genetic coding on her person for the express purpose of recreating it later.</p><ul><li><strong>Immortality</strong>: Mother can replicate any biophysical info onto any computer system and reintegrate it into a living, breathing replica of the original in mere moments, she can just as easily store hers or anyone else's essential self onto the net in order to refabricate them from scratch anywhere at any time. Thusly granting herself everlasting life through the internet. </li><li><strong>Collective </strong><b>Consciousness</b>: She and her nanites are inextricably linked and anyone who sports her devices are connected to her through a personalized hive mind.</li><li><strong>Machine Intelligence</strong>: A hyper-clocking robotic mind enables her vast acumen and creative capacity in the usage of her nanotech abilities. </li><li><strong>Control Manipulation</strong>: She can exert her will over anything and everything with a mechanical interface, all she need so is reach out and make contact with the device in question she wishes to manipulate. This also extends to whatever she has infested with her nanotech.</li></ul><h2>Paraphernalia </h2><p> </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Mother Machine was created by <a href=\"/blackhawks/4050-42975/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42975\">Blackhawks</a> writer <a href=\"/mike-costa/4040-52883/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-52883\">Mike Costa</a>.</p>",

When the Norse city of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\" href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" slug=\"asgard-marvel\">Asgard</a> appeared over Oklahoma, this conflicted with their Christian belief system.

    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>Hikiji is a human character, one of the very few to appear in the Usagi universe. He is based on the real life Daimyo Date Masamune, who lived from 1566-1636 A.D., and aspired to become Shogun, the military ruler of Feudal Japan. Stan Sakai originally intended Lord Hikiji to be a minor character in his <a href=\"../../../nilson-groundthumper/29-7006/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nilson Groundthumper</a> Saga. However, he fell in love with his Samurai Rabit, and Usagi's story became his focus. As a result, Lord Hikiji became the central nemesis behind the Usagi storyline. The character was originally intended to be more of a shadow meanance, always there but never seen. However, Stan did show him in the last panel of \"Lone Rabbit and Child II\". Stan has said he regrets doing so, but wont change this panel. Hikiji has appeared two other times, but his face is not clear in either of these appearances.</p><h2>Character Attributes</h2><ul><li><b>Caste</b>: <span>Samurai</span></li><li><b>Profession</b>: <span>Daimyo</span></li><li><b>Anthropomorphic Identity</b>: Human</li></ul><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Lord Hikiji is the main nemesis behind many of the tragic events in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5907\" href=\"/usagi-yojimbo/4005-5907/\">Usagi Yojimbo</a>'s life story. Hikiji's presence is often felt, but he is rarely seen. He is the Lord of the Mutsu Province, but aspires to be Shogun for all of Japan. The province is in the northeast of the main island of Honshu. Notable landmarks include the Adachigahara Plain, the city of Sendai, and Usagi's home village.</p><p>Lord Hikiji first touched Usagi's life when he murdered Usagi's father, Magistrate Miyamoto, for defying him and remaining loyal to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80332\" href=\"/lord-mifune/4005-80332/\">Lord Mifune</a>. When Usagi later became a bodyguard for Lord Mifune, Lord Hikiji was behind an assanation attempt. His agents failed to kill Mifune in his sleep, but they did execute both Mifune's wife and son. Hikiji orchestrated the betrayal of Mifune by his trusted <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80334\" href=\"/toda-buichi/4005-80334/\">General Buichi Toda</a>, resulting in Mifune's defeat and death at the great battle of Adachigahara.

He acted as the wizard's right hand man, and was willing to fight valiantly for him, although he sometimes questioned his master's leadership. In a conflict with the Legion of Super-Heroes on Tharn, Vrykos took Mysa Nal hostage believing her to be harmless in an emotionally comatose state. However, his cruel words were exactly what she needed to push her over the edge, and she recovered and obliterated him with her magic.</p>",

Miles makes him promise that what he is about to show him must never be talked about outside this room. After Ganke promises Miles tells him to prepare to be freaked out like you never been freaked out before. Ganke asks him to not pull down his pants. Trying to turn invisible again, Miles stands in Ganke's room concentrating immensely. Ganke asks him if he is trying to take a dump. Since Miles could not activate his camouflage ability he decides to show off his spider-sense by striking Ganke's LEGOs. Saddened more than impressed, Ganke asks Miles to try it on something that he hasn't been working on for three weeks.</p><p>Later that same night, Ganke sends Miles a text. Ganke tells him that he is not a mutant and that the abilities he displayed a very similar to ones that different spiders have. Miles asks Ganke what he's talking about and Ganke explains how Spider-Man was bitten by a spider too and then sends him a link to a article written by Ben Ulrich titled 'Spider-Man Myth Busted'. Miles reads through the article and is shocked. Ganke proceeds to apologize for him not being a mutant and then asks him if he is Spider-Man.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Prior to her transformation into one of the first American Vampires, Mimiteh was a young Native American \"married\" to a settler, who took her from her family. Feeling trapped in her house, when a group of European men came to her husband, in hopes of allowing her to guide them through the unsettled American plains, she jumped at the opportunity to join them. As she spent more time with the men who recruited her, she began to feel as if something wasn't right. Every night they'd mysteriously leave the group to go out \"hunting.\" One night she decided to follow the men into the woods, only to find that the men were Vampires. The men discovered her, and attacked, but were broken up by members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58254\" href=\"/the-vassals-of-the-morning-star/4060-58254/\" slug=\"the-vassals-of-the-morning-star\">Vassals of the Morning Star</a>, who ended up killing the vampires. Not wanting to take a risk, and feeling as if she was dead already, the Vassal members put a stake through Mimiteh's heart, but when the sun rose, and the other vampires faded away, Mimiteh didn't, the stand of vampirism had mutated within her, as she arose and pulled the stake from her heart. She would wonder the plains, eventually finding her old tribe, but fearing what she was, her tribe sealed her in a cave, hoping she'd never get otu.<br/><h2>Creation</h2>Mimiteh was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4050-32051\" href=\"/american-vampire/4050-32051/\" slug=\"american-vampire\">American Vampire</a> writer<a data-ref-id=\"4040-58926\" href=\"/scott-snyder/4040-58926/\" slug=\"scott-snyder\"> Scott Snyder</a> and first depicted by artist <a data-ref-id=\"4040-21425\" href=\"/jordi-bernet/4040-21425/\" slug=\"jordi-bernet\">Jordi Bernet.</a> <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Beast in the Cave</h3>During the American Indian Wars, a time before <a data-ref-id=\"4005-69921\" href=\"/skinner-sweet/4005-69921/\" slug=\"skinner-sweet\">Skinner Sweet</a> was turned into what many believed to be the first <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58629\" href=\"/american-vampires/4060-58629/\" slug=\"american-vampires\">American Vampire</a>, and was still considered the adoptive brother of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70130\" href=\"/james-book/4005-70130/\" slug=\"james-book\">James Book</a>, both men were in the US army, fighting battles agains the Apache Indians. The leader of the tribe they were facing, Hole in the Sky, felt it necessary to call on an ancient goddess of death to help him fight off the American forces.

When Hole in the Sky goes to call upon her, it is revealed that she is in fact the true first American Vampire, despite Skinner Sweet eventually holding that title.",

He first appeared in the DC Special Series Volume 1: 5 Star Super Hero Spectacular in September, 1977.

Upon finding the Sunstone and transforming into the villainous being called Sunburst, Omar would run into the path of Aquaman.</p><p>The two clashed, and after a good fight, Sunburst defeated Aquaman, and to add more insult to injury, dropped the unconscious Atlantian King into an Iranian desert. As Omar continued to make his dream a reality, Aquaman was able to find an Oasis and gather enough water for him to survive and make it to Omar's next location, the city of Bakushi.</p><p>The hero &amp; villain fight once more, however Aquaman wiser from their previous encounter was able to defeated the Sunburst being, by reflecting it's own powers against it using a mirror. After these two confrontations, Omar, aka the villainous Sunburst, is never seen from again...</p>",

    "description": "<h2><span id=\"Biography\">Biography</span><span></span></h2><h3><span id=\"Collaboration_with_the_First_Sons\">Collaboration with the First Sons</span><span></span></h3><p>When DARPA collaborated with the First Sons by funding the Ray Sphere, Moya Jones worked directly with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75881\" href=\"/kessler/4005-75881/\" slug=\"kessler\">Kessler</a> and as an alliance between DARPA and the First Sons, during the Ray Sphere development.</p><p>Moya had Kessler show her one of the tests subjects, David Warner, and explain Ray Sphere's effect on him after each time he was exposed to it, though she is disgusted by Kessler's tests. Though Moya and DARPA were unaware of Kessler's true intentions for the Ray Sphere, he used the Ray Sphere to create the Blast. Subsequently, Moya and several soldiers attempted to arrest Kessler for causing the Blast. However, Kessler killed the soldiers and told Moya that the Ray Sphere was with NSA agent John White. Moya then made it her main focus to obtain the Ray Sphere for DARPA by finding John.</p><h3><span id=\"Working_with_Cole\">Working with Cole</span><span></span></h3><p>After the Quarantine was put in place following the Blast, Moya worked to track down John White. After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-63246\" href=\"/cole-macgrath/4005-63246/\" slug=\"cole-macgrath\">Cole MacGrath</a> attempted to break through Quaratine, he ended up trapped in a decontamination unit and the door shuts. Being a powerful Conduit, Moya saw him as an opportunity to get the Ray Sphere. Moya revealed herself to Cole, and lied that John White was her husband, and lost contact with him after the Blast despite her connections.</p><p>Moya shortly made an agreement with Cole: if he can find the Ray Sphere and John, she will clear Cole's name and free him from the Quarantine. She then taps Cole's phone and has him return to Empire City. Moya has Cole carry out various missions, such as collecting John's Dead Drops, tracking down her contacts like Brandon Carey, twarting many of the Reaper and Dust Men's operations.</p><h3><span id=\"Secrets_Revealed\">Secrets Revealed</span></h3><h3><span id=\"Attack_on_Empire_City\">Attack on Empire City</span><span></span></h3><p>As the attack on Empire City continued, Moya prepared to lead a military operation to capture Cole, feeling that he is too powerful to remain a free man. However, feeling Sasha would be a threat to the operation because of her love for Cole, Moya had Sasha found and later imprisoned, where her black tar is extracted hoping to use it against Cole. Subsequently Moya's troops invaded Empire City. Moya called Cole on his phone and told him how serious she was about the operation. Subsequently, Moya sent several soldiers to save Cole from David Warner, who tried to kill Cole believing him to be Kessler in disguise.</p><p>Eventually, Cole and David fought in a building where Moya called Cole on a phone and warned him to escape before the building is bombed by the military to kill David. Later at Steel Harbor, Moya told the military general that without Cole, DARPA and the military cannot replicate the Ray Sphere effect. Moya then suggested they move Cole far away from Empire City as David was still trying to kill him. As their attempts to capture Cole failed, Moya claimed they should change their methods to capture him. Shortly thereafter Moya and the military were able to track down Cole. Utilizing Sasha's tar, Moya was able to have Cole captured.</p><p>At Steel Harbor on a military ship, Moya tried to convince Cole to work for the military. However, he refused and Moya decided that a device should be implemented into his skull allowing them to have total control over Cole. However, Cole soon escaped with Sasha's aid after she broke from her cell. Moya, however, was able to stealthily attack Sasha from behind with a pipe. Sasha retaliates, though Moya is aided by several troops.</p><p>As the ship they were on began to sink because of a fight outside with Cole and David and military Conduits, the military general threatened to shut down Moya's operation because of her recent actions. Moya then killed the general with a gun and ran to see the carnage outside. As Cole kills David, Moya warned him that in one phone call, there could be a bounty on him. However, as ship sunk, Moya was suddenly trapped. Though Cole tried to save her, Moya told him to leave before he is killed by the water. With this, Moya died drowing in the ship.</p>",

    "description": "<h2><span id=\"Biography\">Biography</span></h2><h3><span id=\"The_First_Sons_and_Cole\">The First Sons and Cole</span><span></span></h3><p>Lucy Kuo was an undercover agent working with the National Security Agency, assigned to learn more about the First Sons alongside John White and their inside associate, Sebastian Wolfe. White and Kuo were specifically chosen due to both possessing the unique Conduit gene. John was stationed in Empire City, whereas Kuo was stationed in New Marais. She had ongoing regular meetings with both Wolfe and John, the former being in person, while the latter on radio.</p><p>Most of the meetings consisted of information regarding the happenings of Empire City and New Marais, Joseph Bertrand and Kessler's activities, and the observations regarding Cole MacGrath. After learning of the sensitivity of their mission, believing that only they will know the risk involved, the three decided to deviate from the chain of command, and work separate from the NSA. During this time, Kuo had developed a fatherly relationship with Wolfe, both trusting each other with their lives.</p><p>After losing contact with John White, Kuo was sent to meet with Cole MacGrath in Empire City and convince him to come with her to New Marais, as part of Wolfe's plan. When she arrived, she saw Cole, still grieving over the loss of Trish Dailey, but showed strong conviction. She explained everything to Cole, telling him that she and her associate were fully aware of the nature of The Beast, and said that they can help him by improving and giving Cole new powers. Convinced, Cole readied himself to leave for New Marais. Right as they were about to leave, The Beast arrives and attacked Empire City, which nearly cost Cole his life. After helping Cole back on board the boat, Kuo attended to her duties while onboard.</p><h3><span id=\"Finding_Wolfe\">Finding Wolfe</span><span></span></h3><p>After dealing some trouble getting into the city, Kuo and Cole managed to arrive at New Marais, though when they did, Sebastian Wolfe, was involved in some trouble with the <a href=\"http://infamous.wikia.com/wiki/Militia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Militia</a>. The two hurriedly made their way to him before more trouble ensues, and eventually split up along the way. After meeting with Wolfe and his capture, Cole and Kuo worked cooperatively to track down Wolfe before he is killed.</p><p>She first instructs Cole to fetch Wolfe's Dead Drops at Smut Triangle, believing they might contain messages that can help them. She would also help Cole locate Blast Shards around the city, and also inform Cole of several notes from Wolfe regarding the powers of a Conduit. Kuo would help Cole improve his powers with Wolfe's information, and also notify him of any <a href=\"http://infamous.wikia.com/wiki/Karma_Opportunities#Good_Karma_Opportunities\" rel=\"nofollow\">civilians in need of help</a>, and give radio support at times. He would later inform Cole of Bertrand's activities and his involvement with Wolfe, telling him to go to him for information.</p><p>After failing to gain info from Bertrand, Kuo opts to follow Bertrand's main interrogator, and worked with Cole in tracking him to their base. After an ample amount of time at the casino, the man leaves, and Kuo and Cole eventually followed him. Reaching their base, Kuo quietly sneaked inside the building while telling Cole to clear the area of any hostiles for their escape. Afterwards, Kuo was able to extract Wolfe, and got him on a pick-up truck. There, she worked with Cole in escaping the area. As they drew closer from escaping the Militia, their truck got ran over by a Militia truck, which sent their truck flying towards the nearby shore. Wolfe was killed, and Cole watched as Kuo got taken away alive by the Militia.</p><h3><span id=\"Transformation\">Transformation</span><span></span></h3><p>After taking her in, Bertrand had conducted several experiments on Kuo, siphoning her blood nearly dry and filling her veins with an unknown liquid substance. This was able to activate her Conduit abilities, and unlocked her powers. Afterwards, she was repeatedly subjected into the Transfer Device, as part of her powers would be transplanted to several of the men that were a part of the Vermaak 88 Militia group. Each subjection would render the transfer of powers less effective, as the Vermaak 88 units would only get a very small fraction of Kuo's powers. She would later be held captive at the Vermaak 88's Storage Facility, attached to an unknown device at the very center.</p><p>After an ample amount of time learning of her whereabouts, Cole was able to find Kuo's location, and had planned a rescue mission. After infiltrating the base and dealing with the nearby hostiles, Cole breaks in the carriage house and rescues Kuo, freeing her from her bounds and helping her out of the facility. As they left, the Ice Conduits left along with them, though they barely did any trouble towards Cole and Kuo. Kuo, appearing sickly and injured, slowly makes her way to <a href=\"http://infamous.wikia.com/wiki/Zeke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zeke</a>'s pickup truck, and barely manages to get on. Afterwards, she passes out, and was put to bed in order for her to rest.</p><h3><span id=\"As_a_Conduit\">As a Conduit</span></h3><p>After a considerable amount of time practicing, Kuo informed Cole that Wolfe had hidden a Blast Core at the cemetery after the former reviewed more of the late doctor's notes and assets. Utilizing a photo left behind by Wolfe, Cole and Kuo searched for the Blast Core, all the while dealing with the Militia and the Corrupted. During their time looking, Cole found several of the plague victims, which is explained further by Kuo after Cole expressed disbelief. After dealing with a Hive Lord, Cole and Kuo managed to locate the Core, as the former exclaimed in confidence that they would be unstoppable once paired. After thanking her \"coach\" for the help, Kuo left the area.</p><h3><span id=\"Dealing_with_the_Militia\">Dealing with the Militia</span><span></span></h3><p>After gaining the rebels at their side, Laroche and his men, Cole, Nix, and Kuo prepare to attack the fort. Kuo instructs Cole to team up with her during the initial attack to get rid of the heavy weapons, while Laroche and his men storm the area right after the two finish their part. Nix will then appear to help Cole as they search for the device. They all carried out their plan, and was successful in their initial attack. Kuo looked for the device with some rebels as Nix and Cole helped get rid of the Militia around the area, and managed to contain them just in time for them to bring out the Device, as Kuo awaited for its destruction. Cole then decides to use the device, much to Kuo's dismay, but manages to convince her otherwise if he changes powers with her instead of Nix. Regardless of his choice, Kuo leaves the area, and appears later in Flood Town.</p><h3><span id=\"Exposure\">Exposure</span><span></span></h3><p>After Cole restored power to Flood Town, Kuo met up with Zeke and established a base in a train car nearby the bridge. Kuo and Zeke were discussing Bertrand's whereabouts, when Nix joined them. Calling in Cole, he arrives as they continued to discuss the subject, with Nix being bound from it.</p><p>Cole arrives and listens to the discussion, as Nix calls for his attention. When Cole gave her the chance to speak, she mentions what she knew; that Bertrand had assembled all of the Corrupted, creating them out of humans and then utilize them. She even mentions that she had her own, but died in an attack. Kuo was skeptic about it, sarcastically laughing about the subject. Before Nix got the chance to start a fight, Kuo mentions to Cole that she and him should collect evidence to prove Nix's theory. Cole ponders over this, and leaves the train car right after telling all of them to get ready.</p><p>Cole decides to go with Kuo's plan, and was given a camera to take pictures of the creatures while she prepares to tap into the city's broadcasting line. After obtaining the pictures, Cole sends them over to Kuo, who then broadcasts all of the shots to New Marais, revealing Bertrand's true nature. She then regroups with Cole, and works with her to save the trapped civilians at the train yard. After rescuing all of them, Kuo and Cole revel in their success, as they have just exposed Bertrand for his actions.</p><h3><span id=\"Bertrand.27s_death\">Bertrand's death</span><span></span></h3><p>Kuo would then continue her activities around the city. After some time, Cole calls for Nix to meet up before activating the RFI.</p><h3><span id=\"Turning_on_the_group\">Turning on the group</span><span></span></h3><p>As all of them contemplate on a decision, Kuo, fearful of death, decides to side with John's plan, mentioning that its the only way anyone will live through the plague. This leads Cole to say \"I never thought Kuo would lose her nerve and become selfish.\" After Cole decided to use the Ray Field Inhibitor, Kuo attempts to steal it before they can utilize it. Stopped on her attempt, Kuo angrily remarks that they will all regret their decision, right before leaving the area. She then meets up with John in order to assist him in his plan.</p><h3><span id=\"Death\">Death</span><span></span></h3><p>Kuo then joins John in his attack, making an attempt to stop Cole from recharging the RFI. Facing off at Smut Triangle, Cole subdued Kuo repeatedly and in conjecture with John's presence. After calling forth a bolt from the sky, Nix charges at the Beast, which subdued both the Beast and Kuo entirely. Cole then leaves to fully charge the RFI, and manages to subdue the Beast once more right before he activates it.</p><p>An injured Kuo then approaches Cole right before he activates the RFI, telling him to do it. Cole comes to her aid, and as he held her, Kuo admits that the group was right from the beginning, admitting that she was just afraid to die. After Cole comforted her, Kuo tells him to carry it out. She then watched as Cole activated the RFI, killing the Beast, Cole, and herself, and subsequently, saving all of humanity.</p><h2><span id=\"Alternate_Timeline\">Alternate Timeline</span><span></span></h2><p>When Cole sided with John and Kuo, Nix stole the RFI from them, and Zeke leaves the area, declaring Cole his enemy. Kuo and Cole then meet up with John, whom began the attack along with them, with their abilities amplified. After Cole dealt with Nix and Zeke, and after he destroyed the RFI, Kuo and John appear before him, with the latter confessing that he can no longer continue. John then transfers his powers into Cole, giving him the power and abilities necessary to carry out their original plan. After the devastating blast of New Marais, Cole and Kuo pick up all the Conduits at the nearby area, attending to their needs.</p><p>Afterwards, Cole and Kuo continue to carry out the plan all over the country, as they made their way from one state to another, creating more and more Conduits and destroying anyone that stood in their way. Kuo continued to help Cole, after the latter embraces his new moniker as \"The Beast\".</p><p>After Bertrand's rampant experimentation, Kuo's powers were able to become active, though she was only able to control it after Cole MacGrath helped her out.</p><p><b>Cryokinesis:</b> Kuo's primary ability is <b>Cryokinesis</b>, the ability to manipulate ice and cold air. She is mostly seen utilizing this power during combat, as she is able to perform several attacks, Such as creating an icy cloud that freezes any nearby enemy once combined with electricity. Kuo is also able to spike off large icicles out of the ground to launch enemies into the air, leaving them open for attack. Kuo is also able to throw orbs of ice towards hostiles, and also utilize a continuous beam-like ice attack. Similar to several of the Vermaak 88 units, Kuo is able to create a large ice pilar platform for her to stand on and utilize a better vantage point of attack, and also, defense.</p><p><b>Flight:</b> Kuo also possesses several powers that help her mobility further, such as the ability of flight. Whenever she takes flight, her body turns into an icy vapor (which could be considered another form of teleportation) where she is then able to fly towards any possible direction, unharmed from any physical obstructions.</p><h2><span id=\"Appearance_and_personality\">Appearance and personality</span><span></span></h2><p>As a agent for the NSA, Kuo represented order and good morals whenever she would act. A good person at heart, Kuo encourages Cole most of the time to promote compassion and kindness to others whenever possible, though she herself during certain times, demonstrates utilitarian views. She tries to maintain a calm and collected demeanor whenever possible, though she would crack under pressure whenever it goes on too much. She's also shown a strong sense of devotion and conviction to her workload, given the magnitude of said workload. She'd go as far as to break rules, to the point of alienating herself from her employers entirely.</p><p>After her rescue, Kuo's mental state has been rendered unbalanced; unable to handle the fact that she's no longer human, but a Conduit. Struggling to understand her new identity and powers, Cole helps her realize that being a freak can be a good thing sometimes. After being able to contain the power she now held, Kuo continued to promote good, helping out Cole whenever there was a citizen in need, and also asks him for help as well.</p><p>Her compassion was absent however when dealing with Nix and the Corrupted. Kuo and Nix seemed to hate each other before they even met, most likely due to disliking where the other comes from or just disliking Cole giving attention to another female. She is very cold towards Nix and refuses to even listen to anything she says. She even threatens to hunt Cole down \"like a criminal\" if Cole decides to take Nix's powers over hers. She can come across as very manipulative and controlling at times to the point of her seeming like she either has a crush on Cole or is using him.</p><p>She has succumbed to her fears during the time when Cole first activated the Ray Field Inhibitor. Feeling the pain of near-death caused her to rely on John's plan in saving Conduits, acting out due to her selfish need, which was also noticed by Cole. When she was shunned away, Kuo met up with John to help out, though in the end, she addmitted she was just scared and states her belief that Cole and the others were right about the decision made. She then accepts her fate, along with the rest of the Conduits.</p><p>Her appearance before her transformation was that of a simple agent; a formally-kept hair, a black suit and shoes with a white undershirt. During her imprisonment, Kuo was bound to experimentation, and wore a simple, gray sleeveless shirt, paired with jeans and shoes. She appears with freezing hands that exhaust cooling winds. She's applied blue eye shadows, and has dyed her hair a very dark blue. She also did minor alterations to her attire.</p>",

    "deck": "A former NSA Agent sent to infiltrate the First Sons, John tried to stop Cole from activating the Ray Sphere. Later John became Cole's main form of support through radio contact. After securing the Ray Sphere with Cole, John would be sucked in a vortex where his Conduit gene activated and transformed him into The Beast.",
    "description": "<h3><span>Early life</span></h3><p>Not much is known about John's background or history, other than he's never been married and he has an extreme dislike for FBI agents. At some point in his life, he got a job as an undercover agent in the NSA, and was given the assignment of infiltrating the secret organization known as the First Sons along with agent <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80385\" href=\"/lucy-kuo/4005-80385/\">Lucy Kuo</a>, chosen due to their unique genetic code, possessing the Conduit gene. Kuo was stationed in New Marais while John was sent to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57582\" href=\"/empire-city/4020-57582/\">Empire City</a>.</p><h3><span>The First Sons</span></h3><p>He first met up with a woman named Jane, whom John told that he was a low-level mentalist. He was instructed to a secluded meet up place, though he was only ambushed. He infiltrated the First Sons after passing the initiation. Stationed at <a href=\"http://infamous.wikia.com/wiki/Empire_City\" rel=\"nofollow\">Empire City</a>'s chapter of the organization, John's primary task was to know what the First Sons have been doing that can be considered as a national threat. Able to get himself close enough to the leader of the group, Kessler, John was able to learn of the device called the Ray Sphere, and its capabilities of giving out powers to those who possessed the Conduit gene. John would later get promoted, able to know Kessler close enough, and was also given higher-tier missions, high enough for him to grasp the Ray Sphere. He would also be given simpler missions like escorting one of their scientists, Sasha, to an undisclosed location somewhere in the Warren.During his time, he'd relay the information to his associates at New Marais, informing them of his latest findings.</p><p>Through his findings, he was able to learn that the First Sons do possess materials that can label them as a national threat, with several experiments that involved Ray Field energy, which resulted in the deaths and abnormalities of subjects, both human and animal alike. He would also become enraged due to the lack of proper communications with their head branch at the NSA, making him lose confidence and trust for his employer. After some point, John has learned that Kessler has scheduled a delivery for the Ray Sphere as a package, with Cole MacGrath as the specific courier. Learning this, John quickly got off the facility in order to follow the package, and managed to catch up to Cole.</p><h3><span>Post-Blast</span></h3><p>Following Cole, John was able to get behind him, though was too late to capitalize, as Cole made a reckless turn at a red light. John got off his bike and decided to follow Cole on foot, though he was too late, as the activation of the Ray Sphere was already done, which resulted to thousands dead, and the destruction of 5 city blocks. John made his way to Ground Zero and saw the Ray Sphere at the dead center. He retrieved it, and made his way to safety to the harbor in an attempt to get out of the city with the Sphere. There, he and several other civilians were attacked by those infected of the plague. After dealing with them, John left for the Warren, to hide and sleep in seclusion.</p><p>That night, as he slept, John was ambushed by several of the Dust Men, who came after the Ray Sphere. Outnumbered, the Ray Sphere was taken away from John, much to his disappointment. As he was wandering the streets after the Sphere was stolen, John passed by a group of civilians who were viewing the picture of a man who could \"shoot lightning out of his hands\". John abruptly made his way through the crowd and viewed the photo: it was Cole MacGrath along with Zeke Dunbar, with the former having electric currents coming out of his hand. John was extremely relieved to find Cole alive, as he scoured the city for his whereabouts.</p><p>As John observed Cole develop his powers from afar, John saw him as a very potential ally and a perfect counter-measure to the Conduit mentioned in Kessler's vision. After relaying some of his findings to Agent Lucy Kuo and Sebastian Wolfe, John established contact with Cole, and instructs him to meet by the old Adamson Building by the Warren. There, Cole's initial meeting with John was interrupted by a chopper sent by the NSA to extract John, though John believed it to be a hostile. Fleeing, John escaped the area and made his way to the northern section of the Warren. Cole followed him and the chopper, and was able to subdue the Golem Conduit that shot it down. After the conflict though, John escaped the area. Soon, John called Cole again, and told him that the Dust Men have in their possession, the Ray Sphere, and told Cole to retrieve it along with an extra trustworthy associate.</p><h3><span>Death</span></h3><p>During John's call to Cole, the latter asked John what he wanted to tell his alleged wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80384\" href=\"/moya-jones/4005-80384/\">Moya</a>, much to his surprise. John didn't know anyone named Moya, and was still single in terms of marital status. John told Cole that he was being duped, and pushed on his order to retrieve the Sphere. After this, Cole and his best friend Zeke tried to take the Ray Sphere, but failed after the latter betrayed Cole. From then on, John acted prominently as Cole's radio backup and main accomplice during missions. He had assisted Cole in the efforts of retrieving the Ray Sphere, through sabotage of the First Sons' equipment, and also reducing their overall morale. After several missions, they were able to deduce the Ray Sphere's location, and both converged to the location.</p><p>Cole arrived at the pier at the Historic District, with John right behind him. The former cleared the way to the Sphere, dealing with every soldier that has been posted, while the latter took cover from the ongoing battle. Arriving at the metal casing of the Ray Sphere, John talked about the aura he got from it the moment he held it in his hands. Not taking any chances, Cole destroyed the Ray Sphere with a Lightning Storm.</p><p>Thus the device cracked open, revealing a strong energy vortex. John was pulled into the vortex, every bit of his being torn apart, and faded into nothing. Cole escaped the area before he himself was affected. John was reduced to ashes, though his mind remained dormant, and unknowingly, was able to grasp the power found within the Ray Sphere's vortex.</p><h3><span>Rebirth</span></h3><p>After a month, John's subconsciousness was reawakened, and the build-up of power within him that roots from the Ray Sphere has caused a destructive vortex to appear nearby Empire City's Archer Square. Cole, who witnessed what has transpired by the docks of the city, rushed back to see what it was. After the initial rebirth, John was transformed into a giant pyrokinetic Conduit rendered in a molten lava-like skin or husk. During his initial rebirth, John's mentality was still fragmented, attacking all those whom he saw as a threat. The initial and most powerful threat at the time was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-63246\" href=\"/cole-macgrath/4005-63246/\">Cole MacGrath</a>, who saw John as the <b>The Beast</b>, a destructive entity seen in a prophetic vision by Kessler. John, while berserk, fought his former friend by a nearly destroyed harbor with his new powers.</p><p>Though he fought hard, John was subdued by Cole after the latter called forth a bolt from the sky. As he fell to the murky floor of the harbor, John was able to regenerate himself and managed to stop Cole before he got on the boat. As he held Cole with a killing grip, Cole called forth another bolt as a desperate attempt to be free of the Beast's grasp. With the upper part of his giant new body torn to pieces, both John and Cole fell into the harbor.</p><p>As Cole was able to recover from his injuries onboard the escaping ship, John, now \"the Beast\", was able to rebuild himself again with his new powers. Returning to town, he used the strongest of his abilities and destroyed Empire City in a single blast. This resulted in the killing of every living thing without the Conduit gene, while activating the powers of those with the gene.</p><h3><span>Salvation</span></h3><p>The destruction of Empire City had an ulterior motive, as John knew about the Ray Field Plague and how it's been ravaging the state, killing nearly everyone. Learning that the Conduits are immune to the plague, a new idea has begun brewing on his head; turn every living being into Conduits before all of them die from the plague. He thought he could ask his old friend, Cole MacGrath, for help, and went southwards to New Marais, all the while destroying one state after another, creating new Conduits and killing normal humans. All the while, the news and media were trying to deduce the nature of these deaths and destruction, attributing it to an unnatural phenomena.</p><p>John was able to reach New Marais, though he was stalled a few miles away by several hostiles that tried to defeat him.</p><p>As he fought them off, Cole and his friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80088\" href=\"/zeke-dunbar/4005-80088/\">Zeke Dunbar</a> were preparing to attack the Beast with a nuclear missile while it was still far off from New Marais. After a slight dilemma, the missile launched, and hit John directly, causing him to disintegrate to the ground. As Cole and Zeke reveled in their success however, John was still alive, as another vortex appeared between the two cranes where Cole and Zeke were nearby. The instability of the vortex proved too much, as it caused an explosion as the two tried to leave. Zeke managed to stay up and followed the Beast into Gas Works, though disappeared along the way.</p><h2><span>New Marais</span></h2><p>It was not until later that John appeared in his humanoid form, right before Cole, who was dealing with a shipment of the Vermaak 88 Conduit units. John tried to explain everything to Cole by improving his senses so he can see the infected plague victims, and directed him to the plague ward where all of the most critical victims are holed up. He made Cole see the victims that he deemed \"dead\" and directed him to the bearer of the Conduit gene, who was near death. It was there that John demonstrated his powers before Cole, revealing his true nature to be the Beast. Witnessing first hand what John can do, Cole is left with the option to help John, who remarked that \"humanity is dead\" and that the Conduits are the only ones that can be saved.</p><p>After a while, John contacted Cole through telepathy, trying to convince him further about his plan. John also explained why he attacked Cole during Empire City, stating that his first time of rebirth was too overwhelming, rendering himself uncontrollable, attacking any nearby forms he saw as a threat. Just then, Zeke contacts Cole, telling him about the Beast, killing all the lifeforms present at the rural areas of the city, which consisted mainly of the Corrupted. After this, John leaves it to Cole to make a choice: save humanity, or save the Conduits with John by his side.</p><h3><span>Last stand</span></h3><p>Cole had come to a final decision, and decided to fight John with the RFI. Before their final confrontation, John's former partner Lucy Kuo joined him to fight Cole, due to fear of death from the RFI. Though because of a hardware problem, the device needed to be recharged on several substations across the city. When Cole and Nix arrived at the first substation with the rebels, John was nearby, and destroyed the substation before Nix could get to it. The two opted for the second substation at Smut Triangle with the Beast on their tail, as he was able to sense the RFI's presence. John destroyed all of the rebel boats, killing Laroche and his men in the process.</p><p>Pursuing Cole and Nix to the next substation, John made his way to their location. With this, John and Cole battled for the second time. Despite John's powers, Cole was able to subdue him for a short moment, despite interference from Kuo, who sided with John in the conflict. After enduring Ionic Storm, and it was not enough to defeat John, Nix lunged towards him out of revenge for her pets, destroying herself. Cole, enraged, took the RFI to the last substation at St. Ignatius, after warning John that he was next.</p><p>After being knocked out for a time, John regained his composure and proceeded to pursue Cole, who had recharged the RFI device completely. Finally confronting Cole for the last time, John was utterly defeated in the midst of their battle. Overwhelmed by Cole's power, John stumbles down to the ground before the church, unable to go on fighting. After Cole met with an apologetic Lucy Kuo, John could only watch as Cole activated the RFI, killing every living Conduit in the planet, including \"the Beast\" himself.</p><h2><span>Alternate Timeline</span></h2><p>The help John provided proved detrimental in a way, as the Militia and the Rebels are working side by side to take him, Cole and Kuo down, though the humans knew that they didn't stand a chance, and they all died. Just then, when Cole arrives at Smut Triangle, John is attacked again by Nix, using the RFI. Cole deals with her while Kuo covers John, and Cole manages to catch her at the rooftops of St. Ignatius. It is there, that they had their final fight. Cole managed to pin Nix down with his Amp, and electrocutes her to death with the device's electrical ability. Just then, the RFI rolled off of Nix's arms, and into Zeke's. Cole, who saw no other way, killed Zeke, took the RFI, and smashed it right before Kuo and John.</p><p>Seeing this, John states that he can no longer handle what must be done. John, who saw Cole's conviction, gives his powers to Cole through his own unknown means. As John released his powers, the powers that have kept him alive, Cole gains an overcharge in energy. After all of his powers integrated into Cole's, John's body can no longer keep itself together, as he disappeared into nothingness. Cole, now taking on John's role as <i>\"The Beast\"</i>, walks the country, looking for lesser Conduits to raise up.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Luther is your typical nerd, scrawny, clumsy, has glasses and is a target for bullies. Luther lives with his very timid mother (who seems terrified by the outside world, possibly due to an abusive relationship) and he has one best friend, <a href=\"/pete/4005-84300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84300\">Pete</a>, who is also into comic books and video games as well as a nerd. Luther's new life started with a book. Desperate to finally get some respect, girls and get the bullies off his back he ordered \"The Hercules Method.\" His miracle book instructs the reader to: \"...focus the mind, body and spirit towards one goal. By bring all three into alignment, the physical enthusiast can bring all of them under conscious control.\" Unbeknownst by Luther practicing this he has developed some strange talents; incredible reflexes, a danger sense and strength.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Strange Talent of Luther Strode</h3><p>Luther receives \"The Hercules Method\" in the mail and is dedicated to make a change in his life. His mother is one of his priorities as he skips school to keep her company at home. Luther's father has gotten out of jail and he is worried for his mother's safety.</p><p>Following the use of \"The Hercules Method\", Luther starts to notice strange occurrences, such as seeing his mom drop a load of plates before she actually did, allowing him to save them from breaking. Following this, he heads to his high school with his best friend Pete. It is there Luther and Pete see Luther's crush, <a href=\"/petra-dobrev/4005-84303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84303\">Petra</a>. In the spirit of friendship, Pete pushes Luther into Petra, so he can get his friend to finally talk to her. While talking to Petra, Luther is made fun of by his jock school bully, <a href=\"/paul-jacobson/4005-84304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84304\">Paul</a>. Seeing what Paul is doing, Petra decides to make fun of him, resulting in her kissing Luther, telling Paul he doesn't know what a real man looks like. In gym class, Paul targets Pete, causing Luther's \"talents\" to manifest. He breaks Paul's nose with a dodge-ball and later, Luther knocks Paul out as an act of self-defense.</p><p>Luther, who is now much bigger and muscular, refuses Pete's idea of exploiting his new found strength and power. Petra also becomes his girlfriend, telling him that she's \"been sending off signals\" since Luther's first day of school. Since he took a beating from Luther, Paul who had been put in a neckbrace by him decides to work out so he can exact his vengeance until he finds <a href=\"/the-librarian/4005-83595/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83595\">The Librarian</a> with the bloody corpses of his parents. Luther and Pete are shopping in a convenience store when it gets robbed.

Pete tells Luther that he protect the innocent and help the helpless, causing a flashback of the abuse his mom received from his dad. He goes out on a night patrol of the city and sees a couple fighting. The guy grabs his girlfriend, causing Luther to act. When he tries to take care of the problem, the guy's girlfriend gets mad over the help he provides. The following day at school, Petra meets up Luther and Pete. She seems to have bruises on her arms, hinting an abusive atmosphere at home. At night, Luther finds the guy, who turns out to be a drug dealer, again, and beats him to a pulp. After giving the guy a beating, Luther first encounters the Librarian.</p><p>Luther and the Librarian fight and Luther realizes that unlike high school bullies and low rent thugs, he isn't able to anticipate the Librarian's next moves. The Librarian establishes that he is a better fighter than Luther, effectively knocking him out. Vin, the drug dealer that Luther beat up, is in the hospital. His friend, Buck, receives a phone call from the Librarian who lets him know that Luther was the one that put Vin in the hospital. Luther wakes up and finds himself with the Librarian and his father, who is in bad shape. The Librarian informs him that the art of murder is knowledge collected, perfected, passed down and it can only be used to the full extent by people with certain talents. Luther happens to be the one who has raw talent, thus the Librarian orders Luther to kill his abusive father and when he refuses, the Librarian does so for him. Buck and his friends are now out to get an important person in Luther's life, which is information that the Librarian provides. Luther rushes home to his mother and realizes that Buck went after Petra instead.</p><p>Buck punches Petra and she reveals that her father is abusive, claiming that her dad hits harder. Luther comes to save her and kills Buck and all of his friends. Meanwhile, the Librarian pays a visit to Luther's home, where his mom and Pete are there. Pete tries to protect Mrs. Strode and unfortunately, his efforts lead to his fingers getting cut off. Powerless and helpless, Pete's arms are stabbed by kitchen knives, letting him hang off of Luther's kitchen cupboards. Luther and Petra find him in this state and are devastated.</p><p>Pete dies but before he passes, he tells Luther that the Librarian has his mother held captive at the docks. Luther's attack is foiled by the Librarian who was able to sense his whereabouts under the floor boards. Luther releases his mother from her chains and continues to fight his arch nemesis. Luther in all his rage, blindly fights the Librarian who says that without awareness and control, accidents happen. Losing complete control of himself, Luther accidentally kills his mom. Luther's talents come in to play as he's able to focus all his aggression on the Librarian by ripping his spinal cord out. The cops have all gathered at the docks and as Luther approaches them, he is shot down. Later, a body bag is shown as an arm breaks through, thus signifying Luther's survival.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Legend of Luther Strode</strong></h3><p>Five years after his apparent death, Luther appears at a motel where some crooks are hiding and viciously slaughters both of them. Luther returns to his hideout and meditates as for the past five years he has been on a vendetta of killing criminals. Luther infiltrates a stake out against him and effortlessly clears the entire building of criminals and it turns out to have just been an act to see what he was capable of doing. Luther is at his hideout, training when a surprise guest enters in the form of his former flame, Petra. Petra was using the crime lord Michael Hill to get to him and she is utterly shocked at how different he has become. Mr. Hill's forces soon arrive with Luther forcing Petra to run as Luther once again destroys the rest his strike team. A final and elderly enforcer called Binder, and as Luther attacks him, the man blocks his punches telling Luther him and the Librarian weren't the only ones.</p><p>Binder and Luther have a brief, but brutal battle. Binder manages to incapacitate Luther based on Luther's predictable fighting style, and Binder using a paralytic toxin in conjunction with targeting Luther's nerve clusters with throwing knives. Binder tells Luther that there are more like him and as technology advanced, the humans were capable of fighting back and wiping the talented out.Cain from the bible from was the original and first bound as an example for them to remain in secret. Cain then charged Binder with finding the talented and restraining them. Luther awakens again as he overcomes the nerve poison and ejects the blades out. The two continue on with their fight with Luther gaining the upper hand. Binder kidnaps Petra and leaves. Luther uses the crime lord's butler as a means to locate them.</p><p>Luther infiltrates the home of Michael Hill and finds him cut in half and nailed to the railing of the upper floor. Luther begins a battle another of the talented, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/jack-the-ripper/4005-88261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88261\">Jack the Ripper</a>. They fight a fast paced battle, but Jack's finesse, speed, and agility are eventually overwhelmed by Luther's focus on his physical prowess as the battle eventually leads to where Binder was holding Petra captive. Luther manages to seemingly defeat both of them, but he himself is eventually defeated as the two more experienced fighters defeat and unmask him.</p><p>Luther is bound by Binder. He pleads to Binder to let Petra live because he loves her, as she fights for her life against Jack. Luther watches Mr. Duvall try and fight Binder, as he ends up sacrificing himself in an attempt to kill Binder for slaughtering Michael Hill, causing a massive explosion that takes out most of the mansion and setting the rest ablaze. Luther is still bound, but Petra comes and finds him. Luther yells at her to leave, but she doesn't as the flames continue to rage around them. Petra tells Luther that if he dies, she dies. In his desperation and anger, Luther tears the shackles apart, saving Petra in the process. They share a kiss, solidifying their relationship once again, but in the midst of it all Jack has escaped.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234166-6610585560-low_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3234166\" data-ratio=\"0.8015625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234166-6610585560-low_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3234166\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234166-6610585560-low_l.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234166-6610585560-low_l.jpg 640w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111127156/3234166-6610585560-low_l.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234166-6610585560-low_l.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Luther and Petra locate Jack inside of a shopping mall. Luther breaks the door allowing the duo to enter. They find inside appears to be a hundred or so bodies lying all over the mall and blood everywhere. Luther deduces that Jack didn't kill all of them, but he has kept them alive so they die a slow and painful death. Luther puts one of dying people out of their misery before Jack makes his presence known and Petra starts shooting up the place. Luther gets her to stop since it was just Jack toying with her so she would shoot the survivors that Jack has not killed. Luther lunges at Jack, and along with the help of Petra, they begin the final confrontation with the psychotic killer. Luther and Jack trade blows for a time, destroying parts of the mall in the process. Luther tells Petra to go help the remaining unharmed civilians to escape the mall while Luther deals with Jack.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3234170\" data-ratio=\"0.76848484848485\" data-width=\"1650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3234170\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg 1650w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg 1650w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234170-3755284781-db2f4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Jack and Luther continue the battle with Jack seemingly gaining the upper hand over Luther.

He has demonstrated the ability to cut through humans in half wearing body armor using only his hands, and smash through wood, stone and metal with ease. In his fight with Jack the Ripper, he created a massive crater by slamming his foe into the ground. Perhaps most impressively, in his the fight with the Librarian, the force of their blows were enough to fell an entire warehouse.</p><p> </p><h4>Superhuman Durability</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3234155\" data-ratio=\"0.9482044198895\" data-width=\"1448\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1448px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3234155\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg 1448w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg 1448w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111127156/3234155-5308390242-flat_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Luther's Durability has been similarly enhanced- allowing him to use his strength without sustaining injury. When a normal man repeatably punched Luther, Luther felt no discomfort and the assailant hurt his hand. Luther's durability was such that he was unfazed by a entire Warehouse collapsing on him. When he was shot by seven bullets at close range, rather than penetrating through his chest, they were lodged in his muscles.</p><h4>Healing Factor</h4><p>Luther Strode has a healing factor which has increased in effectiveness during his tenure as a superhero. At first, it took him a few moments to heal from being shot several times. However, soon after, he was able to quickly heal from being disemboweled, but not before using his intestines to break the neck of his opponent. Now, bullets barely phase him, and multiple knife wounds are quickly healed. He has also demonstrated the ability to reverse the effects of pressure points, and fight off paralyzing toxins relatively quickly.</p><h4>Superhuman Stamina</h4><p>Luther has shown the ability to fight a maximum capacity despite enduring horrendous injuries. His Stamina is probably an extension of his healing factor.</p><h4>Superhuman Speed, Agility and Reflexes</h4><p>Before his powers fully manifested, Luther, without looking, was able to effortlessly catch a dodgeball thrown at him. As his powers have developed, he has only become faster. He has effortlessly dodged bullets, blitzed multiple opponents before they could react, and moved his hands so fast that they have acted as makeshift blades. Luther has also pulled a \"batman gambit\", appearing and disappearing in front of his opponents. However, due to his lack of formal training, it can assumed this a speed, rather than skill feat.</p><h4>Accelerated Probability</h4><p>Luther like many other practitioners of the hercules method has the power similar to a Pre-cog, enabling him to predict the various different choices an opponent makes. The effectiveness of it isn't fully clear, but the Librarian seemed to imply that he could see 1000 moves an opponent could make, if they didn't share his power set. However, after Luther killed his mother, Luther was able to use this power on his the Librarian.</p><h4>Superhuman aim and eyesight</h4><p>Luther was able to throw projectiles with such precision that he blocked the barrels of multiple handguns in a robbery. However this could be attributed to his Accelerated Probability.</p><h4>Superhuman Hearing</h4><p>Strode presents he may have sharpened senses beyond the seeing range. Showing he could hear or sense when Petra was nearby before she even intruded into his dwelling and again when Hill's mercenary crew followed sweet. Further showcasing this when both he and petra arrived on scene to [[Jack The Ripper]]'s genocide gala at the mall, where luther could not only sense jack's presence within the surroundings but can also hear the heartbeats of all the frightened yet still alive shoppers intentionally spared from the formers culling artistry collection.</p>",

Sethe, along with his armies of the dead, have fought against the green since the moment life and death became real, with each side using animals and creatures from the current time period (ex. zombie dinosaurs and plant based mammals and reptiles.)<br /><h2>Creation</h2>Sethe was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4050-42599\" href=\"/swamp-thing/4050-42599/\">        Swamp Thing</a> writer <a data-ref-id=\"4040-58926\" href=\"/scott-snyder/4040-58926/\">       Scott Snyder</a>. <br /><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Swamp Thing</h3>Shortly after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-79928\" href=\"/alec-holland/4005-79928/\">       Alec Holland</a>'s return to the world of the living, a great threat emerges in the desert, in the form of Sethe. Holland, who is trying to escape his past, is eventually contacted by a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15809\" href=\"/swamp-thing/4005-15809/\">        Swamp Thing</a> from the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-53008\" href=\"/parliament-of-trees/4060-53008/\">     Parliament of Trees</a> to inform him of the threat of Sethe, who the Swamp Thing describes as the ultimate enemy to the Green and life itself. Swamp Thing tells Holland that he is the chosen champion of the Green, and it is up to him to stop Sethe before the being destroys all life.",

    "description": "<p>Rocker Bonn was a former operative of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40521\" href=\"/checkmate/4060-40521/\">Checkmate</a> with the metahuman ability to incorporate mass while absorbing its properties, similar to previous Amazing-Men like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76953\" href=\"/amazing-man-will-everett/4005-76953/\">Will Everett</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76954\" href=\"/amazing-man-will-everett-iii/4005-76954/\">Will Everett III</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19022\" href=\"/amazing-man-clay/4005-19022/\">Markus Clay</a>. Despite this, there is no known connection between Bonn and previous Amazing-Men. In addition, he can discharge the absorbed energy.</p><p>Bonn went on the lam after extensive experimentation by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47233\" href=\"/project-cadmus/4060-47233/\">Project Cadmus</a>. Bonn ended up in the small town of Wayne, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55822\" href=\"/texas/4020-55822/\">Texas</a>, washing dishes in a small diner. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-79803\" href=\"/kevin-kho/4005-79803/\">Kevin Kho</a> came to town, local police was alerted about Bonn's presence by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51483\" href=\"/brother-eye/4005-51483/\">Brother Eye</a> to lure him into the open. Eye turns Kho into OMAC. In the ensuing fight, Bonn is blinded when OMAC punches Bonn's giant concrete face off. While recovering, Bonn attempts to absorb OMAC's energy, only to have OMAC's circuitry replicate inside him, allowing Brother Eye to control and store him. Brother Eye had wanted him as he deemed him as possible help in upcoming conflicts with Checkmate.</p>",
