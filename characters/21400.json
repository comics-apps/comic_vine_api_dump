    "description": "<h2>About Skye Runner</h2><p>The character is a 19 year old girl who lives with her older sister helping to watch over her fiesty little niece and nephew.</p><p>They have a very peaceful life. She is said to be the daughter of the land's last great King. The name Skye is hers, whereas the term \"Runner\" is her class. This is because, Skye's greatest aspiration when growing up was to be a knight, however in the land in which she lives women are not allowed to be knights, they can only be \"Runners\", which is almost a knight's assistant. Usually the Runner will be the one actually getting their hands dirty whilst the knights get the fame and credit.</p><p>Skye however is special, so special that she will become far more special than any knight. Skye is the story's main focus and we as the audience will see her grow into a warrior far mightier than anyone could ever had imagined.</p>",

He took the moniker of Atom Smasher, and wore a suit that gave him an atomic power punch and was defeated by Jay Garrick. He was quickly defeated and went to jail. When he was released he believed Barry Allen to be Jay Garrick. He took the name Professor Fallout, and placed a neutron bomb in a statue. He was quickly defeated and went back to jail.</p><p>Obsessed with <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/revenge/4015-56588/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56588\">revenge</a>, Mota takes the moniker Fusionn, steals equipment from a nuclear power plant and crafts a suit that allows him to shoot blasts of energy. He battles and unmasks the newest Flash only to find it is Wally West and his identity is publicly known. Mota goes on a rampage and West throws a piece of iron into Mota's cooling tanks, melting the suit into radioactive rock. Valerie Perez, Mota's daughter is seeing Bart Allen, the latest Flash. He kidnaps her with the help of Inertia, Allen's clone. His plan is to use her DNA to reconstruct his body. Inertia double crosses Mota and is captured by Bart Allen. Mota returns in the year 2645 as living Plutonium to battle John Fox, that century's Flash. Fox sends Mota further into the future where he decays into lead.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>In <a href=\"/chaos-comics/4010-1864/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1864\">Chaos! Comics</a>, Ernie started as a child with psychic powers of foresight and telepathy. His parents didn't understand him and feared him. After his parents were in a car crash they feared him even more, and life grew worse for Ernie. He was sent to a psychiatrist <a href=\"/leonard-price/4005-53367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53367\">Dr. Leonard Price</a>. Who used his Dream Probe machine. Ernie met <a href=\"/lady-death/4005-1847/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1847\">Lady Death</a> and wanted to be with her, which by her words were possible if all mankind was dead. He killed 12 people and his parents and was sent to mental institute. Second use of the same machine by <a href=\"/mary-young/4005-53363/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53363\">Mary Young</a> killed Ernie and brought him back as Evil Ernie.</p><p>When Chaos Comics! went bankrupt, Evil Ernie was bought by <a href=\"/devils-due/4010-1863/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1863\">Devil's Due</a> and he had a short run, his origin story wasn't changed and seamed to take place after the events of Chaos! Armageddon. Although Lady Death was renamed to just Lady, because Devil's Due didn't have the rights to Lady Death who had moved to <a href=\"/avatar-press/4010-718/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-718\">Avatar Press</a> along with her creator Brian Pulido.</p><p>After a year of being in limbo <a href=\"/dynamite-entertainment/4010-1859/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1859\">Dynamite Entertainment</a> obtained the rights to Evil Ernie. This time the origin story was completely changed. Ernie was the second child of a happier family while still in the womb, his parents were killed in a car crash due to his biological father's possession by a spirit or demon. Ernie survived the ordeal only to grow up into a horrible childhood haunted by the ability to see peoples true characteristics. Then he murdered 665 people in Lucretia and wanted to kill his abusive foster father <a href=\"/buford-king/4005-86858/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86858\">Buford King</a>, but was caught before he could get his 666th victim and incarcerated. He was sent to prison and executed. An event similar to <a href=\"/pandora-effect/4045-53760/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-53760\">Pandora Effect</a> happened and Ernie was transformed into Evil Ernie.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/2517583-evilernierough.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2517583\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5505617977528\" data-width=\"979\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 979px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/2517583-evilernierough.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2517583\"><img alt=\"Pulido's first sketch\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110802/2517583-evilernierough.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/2517583-evilernierough.jpg 979w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/110802/2517583-evilernierough.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/110802/2517583-evilernierough.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110802/2517583-evilernierough.jpg 412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></a><figcaption>Pulido's first sketch</figcaption></figure><p>Evil Ernie is undoubtedly the brainchild of <a href=\"../../brian-pulido/26-44864/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brian Pulido</a>, the founder of <a href=\"../../chaos-comics/57-1864/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chaos!

Ernie's basic task stayed the same throughout his run, he simply had to end all life on earth. he never stopped to think about how hard that task was but as his campaign grew he got ever increasingly bold and devastating in his quest. While he only conquered less than half the USA in the first 65% of his story (probably due to Pulido not wanting to have his story over with too quickly) towards the end he launched several nuclear war heads around the globe but failed to ignite global war when the other nations refused to return fire. These story-lines did seem to feed into the last 20th centuries fear and blasé attitude to nuclear war and nuclear proliferation.</p><p>Chaos! Comics, unlike many other publishers, resisted 'Event' story-lines and had a great deal of interconnection between its characters individual arcs. Two years before January 1st 2000 Chaos! began a story arc with new characters attempting to fend off the end of the world. They succeed but a plot point from 5 years previously triggers an even larger, universal extinction event and all characters current story arcs started to intertwine with this central one. Culminating on Jan 1st 2000 with the destruction of the Chaos universe and the demise of Evil Ernie's Megadeath Quest. This level of planning is almost unprecedented in the comic book world where writers and creative control is rarely so structured and planned this far in advance.</p><p>In Dynamite Entertainment publishing the iconic character has shifted from omnicidal maniac to vengeful vigilante on the payroll of hell's designate chaos lord. Now re-imagined by talented writer Jesse Blaze and artists Jason Craig, Ernie is now depicted as a vengeful fallen innocent turned deadly revenant in service to hell and the master of its domain Lucifer. Over time however he would eventually act mire on his own autonomy often shifting hands to other willing benefactors like Lady Hel; Goddess of The Dead and ruler of the Norse afterlife. Which, in turn, would bring him back into contact with many of the old Chaos! imprints other iconic characters like Chastity, Purgatori, Homicide, The Omen and the like. Ernest is seen in a much more sympathetic light this time around as he is a murderous soul collector who focus's his talents upon the decadent and reviled people of the world, in larger part due to his service to Hell as well as his tendency to see both the good and bad in people, figuratively and literally.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Eternity Comics</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736886-erniehappy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-736886\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1418604651163\" data-width=\"430\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 430px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736886-erniehappy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-736886\"><img alt=\"Happy Times\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" data-width=\"560\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736886-erniehappy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736886-erniehappy.jpg 430w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Happy Times\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736886-erniehappy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736886-erniehappy.jpg 430w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" data-width=\"560\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Happy Times</figcaption></figure><p>Ernest Fairchild was born as extraordinary kid; he inhibited the power of telepathy and precognition. His parents noticed how Ernest was drawing things happening before they actually did. They misunderstood his powers and thought that Ernest makes things happen by drawing them. Being devoted Christians they thought Ernest to be possessed, they saw a priest in these matters, but got no help there. When his father went bankrupt, he started drinking, occasionally hitting Ernest. One time Ernest secret friend, a mouse named smiley dropped down into his mothers coffee cup, his father killed smiley. Ernest being angry with them drew a picture of them hitting a lamp post. Coincidentally his parents drove off the road and hit a tree. His father was in a coma for a while and mother lost a baby. His parents still thinking that Ernest's drawing was the reason they crashed, feared him. Over time Ernest's life descended into hell. His abusive parents and lack of any friends made him a very lonely child. After being relentlessly beaten he told his school about how his parents beat him, his parents denied the charges and said he was uncontrollable. The school requested he be taken to a psychiatrist. Doctor Price believed that Ernie's problems were so ingrained into his subconscious that he would need to use his experimental <a href=\"/dream-probe/4055-55907/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55907\">Dream Probe</a> which would put Ernie into a deep sleep. While Doctor Price worked, Ernie dreamed. He dreamed of a large endless graveyard with a beautiful caretaker who called herself Lady Death. Seeing his potential for destruction, Lady Death told Ernie that in exchange for killing everyone on the planet she would love him forever.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-668341\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.441717791411\" data-width=\"489\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 489px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-668341\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" data-width=\"443\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg 489w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg 443w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg 489w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33224/668341-178e3c9a77c3590cce20d5f1f388e23f.jpg 443w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" data-width=\"443\"></noscript></a></figure><p>When he awoke, he seemed like an ordinary little boy and the operation was considered a success. It wasn't until night fell on the happy town that Ernie took an axe to his uncaring parents. He then went on a killing spree that claimed the lives of 12, not including his parents. He was imprisoned until Dr. Mary Young claimed that she had perfected the technology once used by Dr. Price. Once Ernie was in the machine his mind brought him to the endless graveyard once more. Lady death was pleased with him and told him as a gift for trying so hard she would give him a kiss, but she couldn't be with him forever until all life was wiped from the planet. He agreed to do it and she kissed him. As their lips met, the machine Ernie was in exploded, killing him. She imbues a small plastic <a href=\"/smiley/4005-47345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47345\">smiley faced button badge</a> with her arcane energies as a conduit and when the deceased Ernie is placed in a room the attending nurse pins the badge to him saying she bought it for him as a present to celebrate his cure. Smiley button activates and reanimates Ernie whose first act is to murder the nurse. Now undead and full of an arcane green energy that gave him the ability to command the dead to rise and serve him. With his transformation complete, he took up the new moniker of Evil Ernie and led a war against the living in a world war that was meant to extinguish all life on the planet.</p><h3>Chaos!

Ernie recovered from that quickly, he pinned Mary to the ground and left for the ghouls, he himself moved toward Youngs house to punish them. At Youngs, Ernie first disposed the guests, but when the time to kill Youngs came, he was again stopped by the doctors, who had somehow survived the ghoul attacks.

When William Stone bled himself with <a href=\"../../the-badge-of-evil/18-55642/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Badge of Evil</a>, Evil Ernie could influence Stone a little, but he couldn't take over his body. He gathered as many dead in the Endless Graveyard as he could and they all started to scream, which Stone could hear, driving him crazy. Dr. Price saw that and decided to kill Stone before he turned, and that was exactly Evil Ernie's plan, as he controlled the dead and now with Stone dead he could take over his body. After resurrecting he was attacked immediately by <a href=\"../../rick-young/29-53366/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rick Young</a>, Ernie killed him and fought his way out of court house. Getting second chances of killing people he stuck to the plan, again gathering as many dead as he could, he moved towards Washington. It being Halloween eased his killings, as people opened doors to kids in costumes, Ernie used that to kill as many as he could.</p><p>When Ernie made it to the capital, he started act two in his plan, several ghouls wore his masks, and attacked multiple targets throughout the city, dividing the attackers and making them easier targets. Ernie himself moved directly to White House, with several decoys near by. Security was dealt with kamikaze ghouls, blowing themselves up with grenades. Doctors again tried to interfere, but they weren't able to stop Ernie from killing the president on national TV. Country in disarray made his job again easier, he selected his next target, New York. In New York, Ernie met <a href=\"../../ramsey/29-53568/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Ramsey</a>, who had organized the military to track Ernie and kill him. Ernie fought him tirelessly, being forced to fight hand-to-hand, Ramsey over smarted him. Hitting Ernie with miniature Dream Probe, Ramsey trapped Evil Ernie in a dream loop reliving his past as a kid. Ernie managed to fight his way through the illusion with the help of Lady Death, and escaped. He also brought the government satellite down, which crashed directly into New York causing major damage and death. Then he ordered his ghouls to surround the New York City, and killed personally every living person in there.</p><p>On his last days in New York, Ernie is attacked by <a href=\"../../crush/29-60537/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crush</a>, who wanted to punish him for killing his mother. Carrying a whole arsenal with him and puffed up with drugs and adrenalin shots he lasted longer than regular human but was eventually killed. Little later Price coaxed Ernie to come into their base. Ernie was attacked by several armored soldiers, and finally by Price himself, who didn't care about casualties. Evil Ernie was momentarily defeated, being separated from Smiley he was weakened and but under cement. Smiley being a good friend blasted him free and they joined again. Ernie then killed every one in the building, except Mary Young who was in a coma; and Leonard Price, who he left behind; both arms torn off and legs broken. Ernie was still hunted by General Ramsey, but one time Ernie killed his entire battalion and left Ramsey standing in the middle of corpses surrounded by ghouls, just to scare him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-671715\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5375\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-671715\"><img alt=\"Force of Love\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg 800w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Force of Love\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg 800w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/671715-ernie3.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Force of Love</figcaption></figure><p>But fun times were over, Ernie couldn't get in contact with Lady Death anymore, this bummed him out. Rick Young, who had gone through a bit of a makeover and was going by the name Homicide, was now his general and watched over Ernie while he was using his dreams to make contact with hell. He walked around the hell seeking clues of Lady Death, but nothing, finally <a href=\"../../pagan/29-53461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pagan</a> sent him to <a href=\"../../cremator/29-48781/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cremator</a> with false information, hoping they would kill each other. The battle rages on for a long time, neither of them willing to give up. Only after final punches the veil of truth is lifted and Ernie learns that Cremator serves Lady Death and looks for her himself. Feeling like hero after a fight of misunderstandings, Evil returns to the real world. He wakes just as <a href=\"../../billy-young/29-53364/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Billy Young</a> is about to shoot him. Taking Billy as a hostage, Evil thinks of a plan: To build a machine that brings Lady Death to earth. Using secret tunnels, he travels to other side of the wall, and kidnaps Mary Young. Threatening with Billy's life he makes Mary to build him a machine. On their way to dead base Evil's car is attacked by <a href=\"../../chastity/29-42487/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chastity</a>, who was hired by vampires, who want him to stop killing their food. The battle between the two is ended by the stake through the heart, Evil leaves, but Chastity survives wanting more. Months pass while Mary is working on the machine. The time came and Lady Death is returned to earth, but only briefly, because bringing her to earth released the wave of arcane energy later names as <a href=\"../../pandora-effect/39-53760/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pandora Effect</a>. Not wanting to destroy earth she is sent back. Having learned that Pagan was the one who banished Lady Death, evil returns to hell and fights through scores of guards to confront him. In the meantime, Rick Young leaves Ernie's side thinking that he has lost his way and he himself has to spread the gift of death. Having chopped Pagan to pieces Evil Ernie return to earth and thinks of something to raise the kill rates, specifically nukes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/652611-chastity_and_evil_erni.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-652611\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5525\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/652611-chastity_and_evil_erni.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-652611\"><img alt=\"Assassin/Lover\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/652611-chastity_and_evil_erni.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/652611-chastity_and_evil_erni.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Assassin/Lover\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/652611-chastity_and_evil_erni.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/652611-chastity_and_evil_erni.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Assassin/Lover</figcaption></figure><p>Returning to home in New Jersey for a while, he meets Chastity again there, who was at his house. Not liking the feelings Ernie leaves and asks Chastity to accompany him. Ramsey's soldiers come after Ernie again, having killed them he finds first piece of information about the nukes; In Atlanta there is man who knows launch codes. Next stop Atlanta. On their way there Ernie makes pit stops in carnival and amusement park, of course killing everyone there. Chastity is still making attempts to like Evil Ernie, as she has a crush on him. Lost contact with the dead one who knew the codes, Evil fastens the pace to kill off Atlanta. Finally at the medical center, Evil encounters dead ones who don't follow his commands; this brings him to conflict with <a href=\"../../autopsy/29-53634/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Autopsy</a> who was releasing dead ones from Evil's control. Evil Ernie and Autopsy have the battle of minds, Evil in the end succumbs. Chastity comes to the rescue and distracts Autopsy, just enough for Evil Ernie to get free. Having disposed of the doctor, Evil got what he came for: the head of Garris, the guy with the nuke codes. Having made it to the Forcecom military base Ernie used the knowledge in the head to send nuclear missiles all over the world. Detroit is hit, but most of foreign missiles are intercepted. Evil Ernie moves to Detroit to raise some dead. His trip is cut short by ARA (American Restoration Army), 300 men against one, Evil cuts through them without trouble. Then Cyber-dead arrive and shoot him with arcane energy guns, suck energy is in those guns that it kills Evil Ernie. After that three of the nukes hit their target: Sydney, Johannesburg and Baghdad are obliterated. But the arcane energy that gives Evil Ernie life has a mind of it's own, <a href=\"../../janelle-armstrong/29-53635/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Janelle Armstrong</a>, who now generates that energy in steady rate is guided to place of Ernie's death and she re-powers Smiley. From that energy Ernie's body is reformed and given life. Moving on with his plan he tries to command the dead who died in nuclear blast, but fails, there is something different in them. Disappointed he tries to convert the Cyber-dead created by the government, and succeeds in overriding their commands.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-736888\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9326171875\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-736888\"><img alt=\"Separation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg 1024w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Separation\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg 1024w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/736888-seperation.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Separation</figcaption></figure><p>When celebrating his victory of creating World War III, <a href=\"../../purgatori/29-42482/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Purgatori</a> arrives and kidnaps Chastity.

On his quest to find Chastity, Ernie meets <a href=\"../../the-savior/29-49165/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Savior</a> in Los Angeles. He says that he knows where Purgatori is hiding and they need to get some part for a magic ritual to weaken her. Cruising around and helping Savior for a while, Ernie is lead into the trap and savior revealed to be working for Purgatori. Temporarily subdued Purgatori uses telepathy to dig in Evil Ernie's memories, bringing some long forgotten ones to the surface but also learning of a buried ability to impose his dreams upon reality. Ernie having gathered some strength to resist orders his Cyber-dead to attack, breaking Purgatori's mind-link. Defeating Purgatori, Ernie has rescued Chastity who has had a change of heart and breaks up with Ernie. Ernie understands that, as he has promised himself to Lady Death anyway. After Purgatori's mind attack, Ernie has some questions of his past, he returns to home and raises his parents asking them to talk of his past. While they talk something unexpected happens, Ernest Fairchild separates from Evil Ernie. Evil is left catatonic after the separation; some living ones who are worshiping Evil come and help Evil to regain power by showing death, destruction and evil on television. At the same time Ernest is moving through his home town meeting with ghost of his past. After regaining his strength, Evil questioned the livings who wanted to join as his elites. Some he killed and resurrected, but some of them he saw too weak or weird to receive the gift of death. Still thinking of his past Ernie looks up a girl who wanted to be his friend in the past. Ernie sneaks over the wall and flies to Montana. Wanting the Christmas to be special Ernie reveals himself to that girl, who now is a grown woman. She however doesn't want anything to do with him, and Ernie goes on a killing spree. Coincidentally Lady Death tries to make contact at the same time and succeeds. Reminding Ernie that she loves him and he loves her, Ernie continues his quest for megadeath.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737044-hiernie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-737044\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2534722222222\" data-width=\"288\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 288px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737044-hiernie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-737044\"><img alt=\"Ernie and Ernest\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\" data-width=\"288\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737044-hiernie.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737044-hiernie.jpg 288w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ernie and Ernest\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737044-hiernie.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737044-hiernie.jpg 288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\" data-width=\"288\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ernie and Ernest</figcaption></figure><p>Again having found his place in the world Ernie travels spreading death. He discovers a plan to eradicate the dead, plotted by Dr. Price. Ernie Infiltrates the Black Box, a research facility to create a virus that kills the dead. The scene plays out as something from a scary movie, Evil Ernie picks off the survivors one by one. One doctor manages to board a helicopter with the sample of the virus, and fly away. Making it to the destination point, a dead one reveals himself to be on board and plows up the chopper, right in front of Dr. Price. Again set his mind on nukes, Evil Ernie moves toward Norad. Only thing stopping him is the great wall raised to separate the dead and the living. With massive force Ernie brings down the wall. The dead mind has started to act more on its own. Some of the dead think for themselves wanting peace. Evil holds as many ghouls under his influence as he can. Ernie's first target is President Ramsey, taking over him, he now has the codes necessary to enter any government facility. In the meantime the living Ernest is trying to do some good by helping people and even killing dead ones, one time he even discovers that bullets won't hurt him. Evil Ernie is distracted from megadeath for a moment, when he senses Billy Young in dead mind, but Billy is alive yet. Evil drives to his location and uses the dead mind to influence Billy to kill himself. Another distraction is his undead parents, who now have captured the living Ernest Fairchild. Evil Ernie releases living him and kills his parents all over again.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-737052\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.8096085409253\" data-width=\"562\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 562px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:181.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-737052\"><img alt=\"Evil Laugh\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px\" data-width=\"353\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg 562w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg 353w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Evil Laugh\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg 562w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/737052-ernie1.jpg 353w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px\" data-width=\"353\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Evil Laugh</figcaption></figure><p>Free of distractions Ernie returns to creating megadeath. Ramsey unable to launch the nukes from distance creates a plan to attack Cheyenne Mountain. Evil Ernie and Smiley have a disagreement, and Smiley bails to travel alone. Mary Young is back to hunting Evil Ernie and teams up with the living Ernest Fairchild. Smiley meets Ernie's old right arm Rick Young and joins him for a while. Soon Rick and the independent dead make a pact with Dr. Price and his chip controlled dead ones; every one of them gunning for Evil Ernie. Ernie manages to fight his way to Cheyenne Mountain and takes it over. Without Smiley, Ernie constantly grows weaker. Rick uses the dead mind to get control over Ramsey, Ernie fights back. At the same time Mary and Dr. Price are fighting their way towards Evil Ernie. With all the force the oppressors are unable to stop Ernie from launching every nuke America had. After the launch, Dr. Price still bent on destroying Evil Ernie shoots the living Ernest killing him, his death in turn weakened Evil Ernie, and the two fight. While the two fight they fail to notice Mary Young planting a nuclear warhead into the base and setting it on timer. Ramsey notices it, but fails to disarm it. Cheyenne Mountain and every one inside are destroyed in the explosion. Soon after the nuclear war, earth is washed over by un-creation wave.</p><p>A dimensional rift opens up inside of <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/widmark-maximum-security-prison/4020-62634/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-62634\">Widmark Prison</a> in Oklahoma, from it falls a seemingly harmless smiley face pin. An inmate picks it up, accidentally sticking himself. After a few moments the prisoners roommate falls very ill, but it doesn't matter to him as he is taken to the electric chair for execution. When the switch for the electric current is flipped, the prisoner's stomach explodes open and his body becomes deformed to the shape of Evil Ernie. Evil can sense Smiley somewhere in the vicinity, so he begins a brutal hunt for his psychotic friend, leaving most of the prisoners dead in his wake. In classic Evil style, the dead arise and start a bloody rampage that the prison guards see as a riot. The riot is quelled by Ernie himself after finding Smiley and realizing that he is in a new world. Wanting answers, Ernie commands his dead to die again and leaves Widmark.</p><h3>Devil's Due</h3><h4>Resurrection</h4><p>Next, Ernie is discovered in Sata Fe, New Mexico. There he continues to kill people under the guidance of a numbered top that he presumably fashioned himself for a more amusing method of mass murder. While stalking a selected victim, Ernie finds that the man is part of a satanic cult that kills children. He agrees to let the man live in exchange for information on the other members of the cult. The man agrees and divulges the information. Ernie exits the man's home then spins the top and returns to kill him.</p><p>While hunting down members of the cult, Ernie ponders his free will, asking himself and Smiley \"Am I controlled by God? Or by the Devil?\" As he travels, the viewpoint switches to a young woman named Layna on Evil's tail. She is seeking revenge on Evil for the death of her father, who in this world is Dr.Price. Switching back to Evil, he attempts to and successfully enters the Endless Graveyard. There is just one problem though, all that is left of Lady Death is a fain apparition that only teases Ernie. After the disappointing return to Hell, he seeks out and kills a few of the satanic cult members. En route, he also meets Layna. He sees her and makes her the object of his love, sparing her life. When Ernie finds the last cult members, they have just summoned a demon to which they will sacrifice a young girl. The demon spots Evil and starts to mock him, infuriating Ernie. As he slaughters the cult members and ignores the child, a fire starts inside the sacrificial chamber and Ernie makes for the exit. Layna blocks him, only allowing him through if he rescues the little girl. Of course he complies, and then flees the scene. At the end of the story, Layna pledges to track him down and kill him at all cost.</p><h4>Hack/Slash: The Final Revenge of Evil Ernie</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738273\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5483870967742\" data-width=\"1240\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738273\"><img alt=\"New Love: Cassie and Ernie\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg 1240w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg 413w\"><noscript><img alt=\"New Love: Cassie and Ernie\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg 1240w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/738273-ernie_hack.jpg 413w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\"></noscript></a><figcaption>New Love: Cassie and Ernie</figcaption></figure><p>Some time later, Ernie has returned to his hometown and takes residence at the saw mill his father owned.

Before he delivers the killing blow to Vlad, Ernie feels a psychic cry from Cassie and turns around puzzled. He grips her head and uses the link to read her mind and discovers her past and her goal in life: to rid the world of serial killers. He announces his love to her, but Vlad interrupts and the two escape Ernie. In an effort to gain Cassie's love, Ernie breaks into Clearview Mental Institution maximum security ward and begins killing the murderers there. Cassie and Vlad make their way into the institution and confront Evil again. He begins an attempt to persuade Cassie to join him and live together killing murderers. As he explains the plan, a guard shoots at Ernie and the bullet travels through him harmlessly. Angry at the interruption, Ernie slaughters the guard and returns to Cassie, but sees the bullet has lodged itself in her. Saddened by this, Ernie doesn't want her to become a Dead One and gives the ultimate sacrifice of his arcane energy to bring her back.</p><h3>Dynamite Entertainment</h3><h4>Origin of Evil</h4><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5625638\" data-ratio=\"1.5372233400402\" data-width=\"1988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1988px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5625638\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1249px) 100vw, 1249px\" data-width=\"1249\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg 1988w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg 1249w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg 624w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg 1988w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg 1249w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111141742/5625638-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+094.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1249px) 100vw, 1249px\" data-width=\"1249\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Ernie's life started in a tragedy: he was set to be born to a loving family of three consisting of his birth parents and elder brother, but his father was taken over by a <a href=\"/smiley/4005-47345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47345\">demon </a><span>and crashed the car with his pregnant mother and sibling in it. Ernie's family died at that time while he was still in the womb. The years that followed the boy who'd come to be known as Evil Ernie, would grow up in an abusive and neglectful foster home to a cruel man named </span><a href=\"/buford-king/4005-86858/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86858\">Buford King</a> and his sleazy Girlfriend Eunice. The former of whom would regularly brutalize Ernest whenever Ernie bothered him for whatever reason or when in need of a laugh while the latter of the two sat aside and let it happen. Over the coarse of his childhood Ernest would prey to god every night for the next 11 years while living with them. First for forgiveness on their part, then for deliverance from their cruelty, again for punishment towards his hateful family and lastly a means to judge them himself since his savior never heard his prayers. When they still went unanswered however, Ernest Fairchild changed hands and called upon a new <a href=\"/lucifer/4005-49221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49221\">idol of worship</a><span>.</span></p><p>Years later He would go on to kill 665 people in the town were he lived, which in time would make the news. Dubbed as The Lucretia Massacre of 6/06/2006, by putting arsenic into the water supply, when after Mr. King's girlfriend Eunice tried to abscond him for stealing her semi-truck. She'd be the first of many to die by his hand, bifurcated at the waist and left to rot in the sun, Ernie would then visit his foster father at the Widmark Maximum Security Prison, having walked 20 miles from his former home with intent of killing him to complete a ritualistic sacrifice to the devil. Though severely wounded in his attempts, Ernie failed to kill his father and was imprisoned himself as a death row inmate for the next five years, due being too young for an execution. Time spent in prison with the other murderous dead men walking made his hellish life infinitely more unbearable, as he was regularly assailed both by his fellow prisoners in that block as well as by Buford himself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5625621\" data-ratio=\"0.5171198388721\" data-width=\"1986\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1986px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.7%\" href=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5625621\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg 1986w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg 1986w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111141742/5625621-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+008.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The prison warden who allegedly promised he'd be protected from the more violent inmates in his cell-block, would purposefully look the other way as they brutalized him on a regular basis.

As the switch was flipped and Ernie road the lighting there was a prolonged power outage just moments after his death, the good Father checked his pulse to confirm it seeing as Dr. Thomas could not stomach what was to pass, then on June 6 2010, a supernatural event occurred as eerie green energy descended upon the prison. This arcane force entered into the corpse of the recently deceased Ernest Faichild and violated it, turning his body into a reanimated mockery of the life it once had, thus on that day 5 years since his mass murder and recent death penalization, the nightmare was revived. Evil Ernie Lived.</p><p>After being fired upon several times and reviving, the undead psychopathic teen begins his bloody tiraid by killing his executioner who both killed and shot him in the first place. Then he turns his attentions to Buford who immediately senses he's in it deep soon turning tail and running for his life, while the mobs and local media sat outside the facilities along with Straw, who was perplexed to see what all the fuss was about as one of his inmates came running, Ernie made his grand entrance on the scene shocking everyone who was present at the sight of the otherworldly effigy he had become. Soon after being jumped by a host of criminals, malignant pedestrians and other such malcontents whose sins he saw upon branded upon them; the psycho teen quickly dispatched most of them in a blast of arcane might, much to the chargin of smiley. Others he physically dispatched with uncanny brute force hideously mutilating them in gory fashions, while others he let free due to seeing their inherent goodness, soon after he is approached by one of the news castors who'd been present for his execution; looking to get an exclusive interview. He quickly incinerated her after seeing her traitorous nature. Just before heading back into the prison only to find his friend Mac shot and bleeding the cringing prison warden who'ed told him that his foster father had taken Ms. Thomas, before he opted to save her Ernie first dispatched his unsavory caretaker by disintegrating him his testes outward with his powers.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5625663\" data-ratio=\"0.53509433962264\" data-width=\"3975\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3975px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.5%\" href=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5625663\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg 3975w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg 3975w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111141742/5625663-evil+ernie+vol+1+tpb+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28dr+%26+quinch-empire%29+030.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Making his way to the heart of the prison he is beset by a host of criminals gathered together by his estranged guardian whose also holding Ernie's psychiatrist hostage. Soon after the evil one runs out of arcane mojo just as he charges up to unload on the inmates, this is due to having not yet completed the ritual he enacted five years ago by killing Buford King as told by Smiley beforehand; leaving him vulnerable to the oncoming mob. Ernest puts up an impressive fight for the time being but is quickly overpowered by them and eventually finds himself being slowly mutilated by his foster parent/final sacrifice, Buford questions him about where and how he got his powers as he was looking to cash in on Ernie's devils deal. When it seemed like Smiley had sold Ernie out to Bufford when the criminal shoves his hand into the ghouls innards to reach his heart, but he realizes too late that it was a trick. As the green energy animating him is explosively caustic to living flesh blowing off the would be devil worshipers arm. Ernie proceeds to get free and slaughter the army of inmates he's faced with. Continuing their hunt the duo are soon met by Father Chaplain whose possessed by the spirit of <a href=\"/uriel/4005-50354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50354\">Uriel</a>, one of heavens Archangels. As the hosted holy man beset Ernest with visions of a life he was meant to lead, the undead teen begins to question why heaven was never there when he needed them most. But before the heavenly apostle could further elaborate on the purpose of his visit and Ernie's destiny; Smiley killed his mortal host by possessing a corpse left behind in the previous carnage unleashed, surprising everyone.</p><p>Enraged at what he'd done, Ernest warned smiley never to do such a thing again as per their arrangement they are meant never bring harm to the good. Working their way towards the death row block of the prison, Ernie suffers a panic attack as a hoard of horrible memories of his time spent with the other inmate their come flooding back into his mind. Smiley comforts him as he realizes who let the dead men out of their cages, Ernest surmises his episode came about due to a psychic backlash he had when he sensed their minds. As the inmates began to swarm them, they launched a counter assault where the possessed button took control of one of Ernest's tormentors and assisted him in their premature executions. But Smiley is soon incapacitated by a stray bullet fired by familiar face headed by some of the prisoners Ernie had spared, as a result Ernie begins to lose his powers as Mac; now possessed by Uriel, had incapacitated his demonic benefactor. But they are again interrupted by a now demonized Bufford King who has Dr. Thomas in tow, having grafted Ernie's arm to himself gaining some of the demonic power that Ernie happened into.   </p><p>      </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As long as Evil Ernie is in contact with Smiley he is connected to Lady Death's arcane power which is depicted by the green glow in his midsection.</p><p>When disconnected from Smiley for extended periods of time Ernie begins to decay at a slowly increasing rate and smiley slowly starts to revert to inanimate form. Smiley can operate without Ernie for longer periods of time after a power boost Lady Death imbues him with after a narrow escape when Smiley only just made it back to Ernie in time. They have used this separation both tactically and to be away from each other after a disagreement.</p><p>When the duo are reunited they are nearly invulnerable as Ernie has powerful regenerative powers and Smiley has never been physically damaged while animated, despite being shot clean off at least once. Ernie has completely regenerated from scratch after being disintegrated (by a modified arcane energy weapon) but this took many hours to complete, where as when he fell in acid he was able to climb out continue his attack immediately while still regenerating. Being blown apart he has been able to reform within minutes and when destroyed the first time he was able to exist in spirit inside the mind of a susceptible victim whose actions he controlled and lead to his murder so he could be reborn through his corpse.</p><p>His rebirth altered his telepathy so now he can hear the dead instead of the living and anyone he kills (or is killed by one of his victims) is under his control. These are known as <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-dead-onez/4060-62730/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-62730\">Dead-Onez</a> and while zombie like they are referred to mainly as ghouls. He uses this tactically to maneuver his army and to locate specific individuals that have useful knowledge. This system is called the Dead Mind. Later in the run some Dead-onez are created via an act of mass destruction without the direct hand of Ernie. At times of powerful connection with his arcane energy a circle with spikes, at the compass points, appears on his forehead. During his campaign for various reasons he loses control of some sectors of the dead, either by human intervention or some other mystical means. After the schism between his good living self from his evil undead being had further altered Ernest's psychic abilities, for now even while undead he could effect the thought processes of the living once again; having used this regained capacity to scan the minds of three teen hooligans who brought him out of his vegetative state.</p><p>Ernie's muscle capacity and strength seem to also be greatly enhanced as he is shown tearing through steel doors and concrete walls as easily as human flesh. In his earlier life Ernie had the latent power to influence causality via sketching whatever it was he imagined into art, by drawing events taking place on paper they would soon come to pass e.i. drawing a brand new washing machine in the household initiated his parents winning one through a contest they never even entered, or drawing himself and his family with a little brother beside them following his mothers surprise pregnancy shortly after. Even after his death and transformation Purgatori had found he could shape reality with his mind even beyond the use of his arcane energy as the zombies she encountered while in his psyche became real and tangible, this staggering potential frightening even her.</p><p>The source of all his tremendous power lies within the eerie green arcane energy that powers and animates his being, bestowed upon him from Lady Death through the conduit smiley. Ernest accomplishes a great many terrifying feats such as destructive concussive force, though this is rarely used as he prefers to work with his hands, deadly area of effect arcane energy waves that destroys everything around him from a good distance away. Fueling his control over the Dead Onez and the Dead Mind used to control his corpse legions, in some cases unintentionally granting them their sentience, accelerating his own regeneration and fighting ability via physical infusion and even teleportation or spontaneous materialization out of nowhere with but a thought. Through a potent expenditure of his energies Ernest can even bring a person back to life or save a person who is close to death, usually at the cost of his own life.</p><p>In recent publishing Ernie's powers remain largely unchanged minus some of the psionics powers and reality warping thus far, he instead has the ability to gauge a persons internal center. Their moral alignments which are revealed to him as either hideously nightmarish demon forms adorning whatever sins they committed upon their bodies or a normalized human semblance garbed in a halo of light sporting a smiley button on their clothes respectively. It has been said by many that he is a mesh of angel and demon decent and has tremendous dormant power resting within him it was why he was so sought after by both the agents of heaven, forces of hell and its master as well as certain other chaos lords. How this will effect his abilities or his place in story of the Chaos!/Dynamite universe has yet to be seen.</p><p>The Effects of the Energy Arcane remain the same as well. The energy is the substance that animates his dead carcass and as with previous incarnations, it is supplied to him by his partner smiley which after Ernie can channel and redirect said energies for a number of handy persuit's. Such as melting and seering through flesh and steel, unleashing shockwaves of concussive force, igniting with devastating blast waves of green energy, projecting it as destructive energy waves which can level houses and neighborhoods, augment his physical striking power or infuse them into a weapon of choice, grasp the minds of both living beings to do his bidding as well as perform his trademark of raising those slain either by him or dead through other means to serve as his personal army know as the Dead Onez.</p><p>Other abilities which he's never shown in previous continuity with the arcane force is changing and completely regenerating his physical appearance back to what it was before he died and was resuscitated as a ghoulish specter, along with the ability to attach another corpses limbs onto himself using it in place of his own missing limbs; ironically enough his own necrotic appendages possess enough arcane charge in it to give others demonic powers of their own provided that they integrate said flesh to themselves somehow. Being apart of Ernie however, enables him to pirate their bootlegged limbs motor functions while still separated from him, even going so far as to mystically reincorporate his missing biomass back into himself afterwards.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Amy Grinderbinder met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10525\" href=\"/tulip/4005-10525/\">Tulip</a> O'Hare at school.  At the time, Tulip was considered the smartest girl in school, and Amy was the richest.  Neither really wanted anything to do with the other at first, but they discovered that they got along quite well.  Tulip had lost a father that she loved dearly, and Amy had a father that didn't really love her.  And a mother who had left to become a lesbian.  They were both lonely girls who complimented each other nicely.</p><p>Amy invited Tulip over to her house for the Christmas vacation, and the two of them went to a party together.  The party was full of the sons and daughters of the rich and powerful.  Amy's father had friends at the highest levels of business and politics, and Amy took advantage of that.</p><p>Until it took advantage of her.</p><p>During the party, a group of young men tried to gang-rape Amy.  Tulip walked in on them getting ready to assault her, ran out the door, and returned by ramming Amy's truck through the wall.  She jumped out with a shotgun - a gift to Amy from her father - and began firing.  She nearly killed a man, but luckily the gun was empty.</p><p>Amy felt she owed her life to Tulip:</p>\"Their dads can buy judges.  I should know.  They do whatever they want, and anyone who stands up to them's a slut or a tease, or was probably just asking for it.  It all gets <i>fixed</i>.  It all gets fixed and they grow up to be <i>President</i> or something.But you had a gun.\"<p>The two were inseparable after that.  After Amy's father died (he suffocated while performing cunnilingus on a ten-dollar crack whore), she took the money and she and Tulip spent a couple of years exploring America.  Their friendship even withstood the inclusion of a boyfriend, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\">Jesse Custer</a>.  Together, the three of them tore a wild swath across Texas, becoming experts at grand theft auto.</p><p>Eventually Amy went back to New York, where she started teaching in an inner-city elementary school.  She still kept in touch with Tulip, though, and when Tulip came to New York again, they spent a lot of time catching up.  Tulip was furious at Jesse for leaving her behind while he went to rescue his friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10527\" href=\"/cassidy/4005-10527/\">Cassidy</a>, and sought Amy's advice.  Amy, ever the good friend, told Tulip that a love like theirs only came once in a lifetime, and that she should never let it go.  And if anything should ever go really wrong, to call her.</p><p>Things went wrong.</p><p>After a disastrous trip to Monument Valley, after which Tulip thought Jesse had died, she would up in Cassidy's thrall.  She was hooked on alcohol and Valium, and almost completely under his control.  When she came to herself again, she made straight for Amy.  By good fortune, so had Jesse, who was on his way to find Tulip again after a time in Texas.</p><p>Amy surrendered her apartment to the two reunited lovers.  When they went on their way again, she repeated her advice - if anything were to go wrong, to call her.  As they drove away, she found herself wishing that she were one of them.  Either one.</p>",

His psychological profile was rewritten from \"Anomalous Vampiric Behavior\" to \"Hostility Toward Authority Figures\" (Although he tended to shift back from time to time due to schizophrenia).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After slaughtering two rapists in an alley and drinking their blood, he was recalled by his team leader, <a href=\"/cabbot/4005-26498/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26498\">Cabbot.</a> An amnesiac Deadlock lashed out in a feral rage at him before being gravely injured (An incident which spared him even worse pain at the hands of <a href=\"/supreme/4005-6538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6538\">Supreme</a>).

He was eventually resurrected by Project Born Again in the 2000's, and given the abilities of his predecessor, in addition to invisibility, an ability he relishes using. He participated in the assassination of Quantum, as well as the subsequent Quanta.</p>",

In addition, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10557\" href=\"/sheriff-root/4005-10557/\">Sheriff Root</a> often drank himself unconscious in the back yard, shotgun by his side, looking out for \"Martian niggers.\"</p><p>Her son was a failure in nearly every way - he had terrible grades at school, no accomplishments to speak of, his best friend was a complete stoner, and he was probably on drugs.</p><p>Neither of these people gave any consideration to Martha.  Her role as wife and mother was constantly overlooked, and the only solace she found was in alcohol and Valium.  Her friends, her minister, everyone simply said to trust in Jesus and get by.  Not \"get better,\" just \"get by.\"</p><p>After her son disfigured himself in a botched suicide attempt, Martha came to a realization.  She had wasted twenty years of her life on her cruel husband and their idiot son, and it was time to go.  She trashed her pills, her booze and her Bible, and left the house forever.</p><p>Her current whereabouts are unknown.</p>",

She also thought it was a little sad that, in fact, he only had one friend, the local sheriff's son.</p><p>She got a chance to talk with the boy before his father dragged him back to the house and beat him black and blue.  For herself, Catherine was only in town for a few days, looking to pick up some things and maybe look in on her little brother.  She worried about him - he was intelligent, but reckless, and possessed an intensity that could be mistaken for charisma.  He was a stoner and a nihilist, and that made Catherine a little uncertain about his future.</p><p>His future, however, came to an end when he shot himself with the sheriff's shotgun.</p><p>The sheriff's son tried the same thing, but only succeeded in terribly disfiguring his face.  When Catherine asked him why they had wanted to do such a terrible thing - not only end their own lives but also inflict such pain and suffering on their families - the boy responded, \"Nobody cared.\"</p><p>Catherine flew into a rage, calling him and her brother, \"self-obsessed, whining little shits.\"  As far as she was concerned, if they had cared - about their lives, about the lives of the people around them - they wouldn't have tried to kill themselves.  She stormed out of the hospital in tears, and was probably instrumental in the boy's remarkable change in attitude towards life.</p><p>She is presumed to have returned to Dallas to be with her boyfriend.</p>",

There was a group of disaffected youths in New Orleans who idolized Eccarius, who wanted to become like him. They called themselves, unsurprisingly, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41406\" href=\"/les-enfents-du-sang/4060-41406/\">Les Enfents du Sang</a>.</p><p>Les Enfents were the worst kind of vampire-worshippers. They met in a basement with arcane symbols painted in deep red on the walls. They wore black clothes and too much eye makeup. They wrote bad free-verse poetry about Eccarius. They even cut themselves and drank each other's blood. What was worse, Eccarius encouraged that kind of idol-worship.</p><p>Cassidy dragged Eccarius out by his ear, but not before breaking the jaw of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41374\" href=\"/mako/4005-41374/\">Mako</a>, the toughest of the group. From there, Cassidy set about Eccarius' re-education.</p><p>They spent several days around New Orleans, where Cassidy taught Eccarius that beer was better than blood, that they had nothing to fear from churches, and that nearly everything Eccarius thought he knew about being a vampire was wrong. In the end, they went back to Les Enfents' lair and mooned them.

    "deck": "Lucas Cross is the father of the hero known as Blade. He was convicted of a crime he didn't commit and imprisoned in Latveria.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Earlier in the century Lucas Cross was wrongly imprisoned and dying of cancer. He would never get to hold his child in his arms or see his wife again. He commented that he was lucky that his fellow inmate was a murderer since he would rather not have a protracted death. His inmate rhetorically offers him a way to survive his disease, survive his sentence, and see his family again. Cross asks \"what's the catch?\" and the catch turns out that his inmate is a  <br/><h2>Creation </h2> Lucas Cross was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42339\" href=\"/marc-guggenheim/4040-42339/\" slug=\"marc-guggenheim\"> Marc Guggenheim</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-2424\" href=\"/howard-chaykin/4040-2424/\" slug=\"howard-chaykin\"> Howard Chaykin</a> and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-18117\" href=\"/blade/4050-18117/\" slug=\"blade\"> Blade: The Vampire Hunter</a> #1 (2006) <br/><h2>Mayor Story Arcs<br/></h2><h3>Meeting Blade<br/></h3>In the present, Lucas Cross captures Blade in an effort to fulfill a prophecy wherein Blade is required to drink a virgin's blood.  He chains Blade up with a young girl and starves him in an effort to force him to drink her blood or die. At first, it appears that Blade was going to give into his vampire blood-lust but true to his heroic origins he chews off his own hand to escape rather than give into his vampiric urges.  However Blade unwittingly fulfills the part of the prophecy which states \"After his vampire urge is sated upon drinking of virgin essence,\" when he drains the blood of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64986\" href=\"/draconis/4005-64986/\" slug=\"draconis\"> Draconis, </a>a vampire priest. <br/> <br/>He uses his position as a member of the benign Order of Tyrana to gain Blades trust. Eventually they venture to Transylvania in effort to restore Blade's soul. He claims that ever since he made the Faustian bargain to become a vampire and live again he has searched for a way to restore his soul. He tells Blade that fulfilling the prophecy will restore all vampire's souls. However, Blade knowing that  vampires' soullessness is their only weakness, refuses to fulfill the prophecy at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56007\" href=\"/castle-dracula/4020-56007/\" slug=\"castle-dracula\"> Castle Dracula</a>. Desperately wanting his soul back his fellow vampire hunter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12710\" href=\"/hannibal-king/4005-12710/\" slug=\"hannibal-king\"> Hannibal King</a> attacks Blade and Blade is forced to stake his former friend. Blade's refusal to proceed with the prophecy forces Lucas Cross' secretive colleague to ambush Blade and incapicitate him. A resurrected Dracula stands before Blade triumphant. It turns out that Lucas Cross is not the only vampire interested in restoring his soul, Count Dracula has been working on the prophecy for centuries.  <br/> <br/>In a confrontation with his father over the restoration of their souls the vial of splintered wood, which represents \"Vlad's remains\",  is shattered and the prophecy is fulfilled. However, Lucas Cross feels no different, he is still soulless. He claims that nothing has happened. However, it turns out that something did happen. A naked Hannibal King stands before them revealing that the \"Returning essence lost, From those undead in graves\" part of the prophecy was not meant to restore the souls of vampire but to resurrect each and every vampire who ever lived.  <br/> <h2>Prophecy</h2> <br/>A father in chains<br/>Freed by a son not yet birthed <br/>Will unlock Vlad's remains<br/>Upon the salted earth<br/><br/>After his vampire urge is sated<br/>Upon drinking of virgin essence<br/>His resistance now abated<br/>Upon learning of Father's presence<br/><br/>Returning essence lost<br/>From those undead in graves<br/>At immortal living's cost<br/>To the man known as Blade<br/><br/>The prophecy was stolen off of Lucas Cross' computer by the vampire detective Hannibal King. <br/> <br/><h2>Powers and Abilities </h2>Much like that of a typical Vampire, Lucas Cross, has super strength, speed, stamina, and agility. Immune to aging, with limited psychic abilities, based on blood connections, he requires blood to maintain his full strength. He is vulnerable to garlic, silver and sunlight. <br/> <br/><b>Physical Statistics </b><br/>Height: 6'6\"<br/>Weight: 224 lbs<br/>Eyes: Brown<br/>Hair: Bald",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Gustav Hertz was a young German boy working in a factory until his arms got caught in a machine. He lost both of his arms, but learned how to use his teeth and feet in the same manner as his arms. Hertz developed an extreme hatred for machines, and was sent by the Gestapo to America in order to destroy their machines. After committing a brutal murder, <a href=\"/the-angel/4005-36389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36389\">the Angel</a> was sent after Armless Tiger Man. The Angel's chase culminated in a battle at the Johnston Defense Plant, where the Angel defeated Armless Tiger Man and handed him over to the police.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Armless Tiger Man was created by Paul Gustavson and Al Bellman. He first appeared in 1941's <em>Marvel Mystery Comics</em> #26, and has since become one of Marvel's most infamously bizarre characters.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Flags of Our Fathers</h3><p>During World War II when the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> sought to conquer the African kingdom of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wakanda/4020-41027/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41027\">Wakanda</a> in order to plunder its <a href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">Vibranium</a> resources, Armless Tiger Man was one of the special operatives the Red Skull selected to allow him to conquer the kingdom without expending any more German troops. Armless Tiger Man took great pleasure in satisfying his cannibalistic urges on several Wakandan prisoners after they refused to falter during interrogation.</p><p>Following the Red Skull's orders, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/master-man/4005-15205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15205\">Master Man</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/warrior-woman/4005-28406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28406\">Warrior Woman</a> distracted the Wakandans by directly attacking their city, while Armless Tiger Man infiltrated the royal palace. He slaughtered his way past countless royal guards until he was able to take the Wakandan prince, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/tchaka/4005-62659/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62659\">T'chaka</a>, hostage. With T'chaka in his possession, Armless Tiger Man sought to make off with his hostage, if not for the timely intervention of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/howling-commandos/4060-32653/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32653\">Howling Commando</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/gabriel-jones/4005-13836/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13836\">Gabriel Jones</a>, who came upon the scene and quickly killed Armless Tiger Man with a shot to the head. This wound up being just one of many setbacks in the Red Skull's plan, which soon fell apart after this.</p><h3>Incredible Hercules</h3><p><a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>, <a href=\"/aegis/4005-21191/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21191\">Aegis</a> and <a href=\"/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\">Amadeus Cho</a> would travel to <a href=\"/tartarus/4020-55900/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55900\">Tartarus</a> where they are greeted by a welcoming committee consisting of numerous dead villains like Armless Tiger Man in service of <a href=\"/pluto/4005-2636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2636\">Pluto</a>. Hercules stands down when Pluto appears with <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\">Zeus</a> as his captive. Armless Tiger Man and the other villains were then chosen to serve as the jury for Pluto's trial of Zeus. When it was revealed however that Pluto was never going to make good on his promise to release the jury members from Tartarus if they sided with him, Armless Tiger Man and the rest of the jury attacked the deceitful god.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Despite not having arms, Armless Tiger Man is able to use his mouth and feet in much the same way. His teeth have been shown to be strong enough for him to grab a chain with his mouth or swing from a rope by hanging on with his teeth, and he is agile enough to lift weights with his legs and even throw knives with his feet. He can claw at people with his sharpened toenails, and his teeth have also been sharpened to be deadly weapons.</p>",

She was the last cow standing (the others were eaten by the alligators) and escaped from the pit to become a Good Doer.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Man-Eating Cow was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-43197\" href=\"/ben-edlund/4040-43197/\">Ben Edlund</a>.

After the battle, The Tick and Arthur decide to journey to NYC. The Tick leaves The City in the capable \"hands\" of The Man-Eating Cow, as he considers her to have proven herself and to have a good fighting strategy.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>In addition to her appearances in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-20103\" href=\"/tick/4050-20103/\">The Tick</a> comic, Man-Eating Cow has her own <a data-ref-id=\"4050-20101\" href=\"/man-eating-cow/4050-20101/\">eponymous comic</a>, and appeared in The Tick animated series (first appearance in the series: Season 1, Episode 13, \"The Tick vs. Arthur's Bank Account,\" airdate Feb. 11, 1995).</p><p>Bandai's series of action figures tied to the comic and cartoon produced a Man-Eating Cow figure in 1994.</p>",

    "description": "<p>No doubt about it, Cal Hicks was a hero straight out of the action movies.  He had a hair-trigger temper, a drinking problem, and a habit of saving beautiful women from firefights.</p><p>One of those beautiful women was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41613\" href=\"/tommi-ryder/4005-41613/\">  Tommi Ryder</a>, a beautiful supermodel-turned-lawyer who got her hands on a tape that would put international terrorist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41617\" href=\"/saddam-hopper/4005-41617/\">  Saddam Hopper</a> behind bars for the rest of his life.  Hopper's people were after Ryder, and Cal managed to save her.  They stole a helicopter and made their escape, but unfortunately the copter went down in the swamps near the Texas-Louisiana border.</p><p>With Hopper's people right behind them, Cal looked for a way out of the swamp.  And a way into Tommi Ryder's heart.</p><p>He was in love with her, convinced that they would be together, just like the hero and the love interest in the movies.</p><p>They were rescued from Hopper's thugs by a more dangerous pair of men, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10529\" href=\"/jody/4005-10529/\">  Jody</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41303\" href=\"/tc/4005-41303/\">  T.C.</a> from the local plantation of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41399\" href=\"/angelville/4020-41399/\">  Angelville</a>.  While they normally wouldn't put up with the kind of macho nonsense that Cal seemed to enjoy, Jody saw that the man thought he was a Hero, and heroes, why, they're always fun....</p><p>During the night, Cal tried to seduce Tommi, but discovered that he could add impotence to his list of personal problems.  Even the dog would have nothing to do with him.</p><p>The next day, they were finally captured by Hopper and his men.  Tied up, facing death and dismemberment, Cal confessed his love and dreams to Tommi, who shot him down.  They were saved by T.C. and Jody, but by that point, Cal's posturing had ceased to be fun.  Jody broke Cal's nose and tied him up in the swamps to be eaten by the alligators.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Catherine was born to an upper class family in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/france/4020-55778/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\">France</a>. When she was young, her father disappeared, leaving herself, brother, and mother to fend for themselves. Using the money her father left for his family, Catherine's mother involved herself in French politics. For Catherine, this was an easy transition as her father was also heavily involved in politics. Even as her mother became quite an outspoken activist against various civil atrocities, Catherine enjoyed her life as much as she always had before her father disappeared.</p><p>Catherine was extremely well educated, even being schooled in various countries across the globe. Attending the best schools money could buy, Catherine easily picked up and became fluent in several different languages. After graduation from high school, Catherine worked her way through college by modeling. Modeling came easy to her and as a result, her face was splashed across most (if not all) magazines in France, Europe, and eventually the U.S..</p><p>When she ultimately finished college, her plan was to help her younger brother Marc through his tenure at college. He didn't need her help though as he made it through college on sports grants. Ever the irresponsible one, Marc tired of the \"normal\" life he led in school and became somewhat of an adventurer. When Catherine learned of his exploits, she too wanted to follow after her family's footsteps and do some meaningful good in the world.</p><p>Thinking the best way to \"do some good\" was to get a job in the U.N.. She started off as just an entry level position but quickly worked her way up to more decision making roles. Throughout every different role she filled with the U.N. she kept the welfare of all people in her thoughts, plans, and actions. This is what drew the attention of <a href=\"/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10149\">Maxwell Lord</a> when he joined the U.N. as the representative for <a href=\"/justice-league-international/4060-26208/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26208\">Justice League International</a>. He was so taken by her drive and professionalism that he signed her to be the Paris embassy chief for <a href=\"/justice-league-europe/4060-41040/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41040\">Justice League Europe</a>. It was in this capacity that she eventually worked her way up to the JLE chief, replacing <a href=\"/captain-atom/4005-2050/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2050\">Captain Atom</a>.</p><p>It was in these roles that she involved herself heavily with the individual members of both Justice League Europe and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League America</a>. She was viewed by all members as invaluable and completely trustworthy. Forming close bonds with <a href=\"/sue-dibny/4005-1790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1790\">Sue Dibny</a> and Captain Atom, the latter being a brief romantic relationship. Her work with the Leagues eventually led her to be promoted to the title of \"Special Officer on Paranormal Forces\". This meant she was now in charge of both branches, even over Maxwell Lord. She remained in the position until the eventual dissolution of the Justice League's U.N. sponsorship.</p><p>She was later briefly seen in a relationship with Captain Atom's alternate self Monarch.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Moving Day</h3><h4>* The first appearance of Catherine</h4><p><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\">Booster Gold</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/blue-beetle/4005-4438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4438\">Blue Beetle</a>, out of costume are out at a Cafe in Paris, when the two heroes see Catherine for the first time. Booster goes to hit on her, thinking that it's a sure thing. 45 seconds later Michele and Ted are walking back to the embassy, and Beetle is laughing about how quick Catherine shot Booster down. Back at the Embassy Catherine arrives and bumps into Booster, in costume, she doesn't recognize him so he quickly sneeks away. Then <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/black-canary/4005-1689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1689\">Black Canary</a> shows up and introduces herself and when she introduces Cath to Beetle, he can't stop laughing.</p><h2>Alternate Version</h2><h3>Booster Gold: Blue and Gold</h3><p>An alternate reality version of Catherine lured <a href=\"/blue-beetle/4005-4438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4438\">Blue Beetle</a> and <a href=\"/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\">Booster Gold</a> into a trap by using an old JLI distress signal. Her attack, however, was interrupted by <a href=\"/hawkman/4005-8337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8337\">Hawkman</a> and <a href=\"/green-arrow/4005-5936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\">Green Arrow</a>, allowing Blue Beetle and Booster Gold to escape. They confronted Maxwell Lord and discovered the source of the diverging realities. When they fixed the source, that alternate reality disappeared, Catherine included. Only Booster Gold, Blue Beetle, and <a href=\"/rip-hunter/4005-4937/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4937\">Rip Hunter</a> retained any memories of this alternate Catherine.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3><a href=\"/young-justice/4075-33/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-33\">Young Justice: Invasion</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/2357853-yj_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357853\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56171284634761\" data-width=\"1191\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1191px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/2357853-yj_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357853\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/2357853-yj_1.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/2357853-yj_1.png 1191w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/2357853-yj_1.png 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/2357853-yj_1.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Catherine appears in the series as the Justice League's public relations manager.

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br/></h2>Evangeline Whedon is a lawyer and a member of the Mutant Rights Coalition. Evangeline used to be a successful prosecutor until others learned that she was a mutant. She was fired instantly and evicted from her apartment the next day. Her fiance left her and her family disowned her. When the  <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" slug=\"x-men\">          X-Men</a> members <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\" href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" slug=\"bishop\">         Bishop</a> and  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4559\" href=\"/sage/4005-4559/\" slug=\"sage\">        Sage</a> were being held in police custody, Whedon and the Mutant Rights League staged a protest for their release. While Evangeline was talking to Detective Cardones, a human struck Cardones with a brick. The blood from the wound dripped on to Whedon, and caused her to shape-shift. She transformed into a dragon like creature, and went out of control attacking everything in sight. Sage was able to stop Whedon momentarily, while Bishop calmed her down enough to revert back to her human form.<br/><br/>Evangeline was soon contacted by the X-Men because they required her services as a lawyer. She represented <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59306\" href=\"/marie-dancanto/4005-59306/\" slug=\"marie-dancanto\">       Marie D'Ancanto</a> in her case as an anti-mutant terrorist. She succeeded in helping Marie to avoid incarceration and she then hired her as an assistant. <br/>Evangeline is one of the few mutants to retain their powers after the events of <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\" href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" slug=\"m-day\">      M-Day</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-18136\" href=\"/x-men-the-198-files/4050-18136/\" slug=\"x-men-the-198-files\">     198 files</a> current consider her to be a 'Significant' nation security thread.  <br/> <br/>When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74176\" href=\"/primal/4005-74176/\" slug=\"primal\">  Teon</a>, one of the new mutants to be activated since M-Day, was put on trial to be sent back home to his parents, Evangeline is the one to defend him. She tells Teon to stop asking to mate repeatedly. <br/> <p><br/><br/> </p>",

    "deck": "The leader of a band of Texas thugs, who inadvertently helped create the Saint of Killers.",
    "description": "<p>Gumbo McCready was a low-down, amoral thug, who led a bunch of similar-minded men simply by virtue of being more vicious than they. The McCready gang stole and killed and tortured their way across Texas until the came to the little flyspeck town of Ratwater.  The wouldn't have stopped there normally, but a great series of blizzards forced them to change their path.</p><p>In that town, McCready met a dark and dangerous man - a man who had fought with the Confederacy and gained a reputation for brutality in an already brutal war.  The man humiliated McCready and killed one of his men.  And for that, McCready would eventually have revenge.</p><p>On his way out of Ratwater, McCready came across some Mexican traders and slaughtered them.  He took their food and their scalps - it looked enough like Apache hair to collect the bounty.  The man they'd met in Ratwater happened upon them, though, and shot most of his gang in the ensuing gunfight. McCready shot the man's horse and left him to die in the blizzard.</p><p>Two weeks later, McCready was the king of Ratwater.  He'd built a new gang out of whoever was stupid enough to join him, and was, frankly , starting to get bored.</p><p>Then the man he thought was dead came back, guns blazing and sword shining.  His wife and daughter had died because he had been delayed, and he had been delayed because of McCready.</p><p>He shot his way through the gang, killing them and cutting them down.  But McCready took a hostage, a pretty young woman, thinking it would stop the old soldier from shooting at him.  It did not.  The girl died instantly, and the man had McCready dead to rights.</p><p>Then the hammer of his gun fell on an empty chamber.  That was all the time McCready needed to catch him off his guard, knock him to the ground and put the blade of a shovel through his ribs.  This time, McCready was certain he was dead.</p><p>He was right, but the story certainly wasn't over.</p><p>He sat in Ratwater, his wounds festering and slowly dying.  He tried to form another gang, but the only people left were either too old, too young, infirm or women.  It was only a matter of time before infection or alcohol would have killed McCready.  But <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10522\" href=\"/saint-of-killers/4005-10522/\">Saint Of Killers</a> got to him first.</p><p>The man he had killed had gone to Hell with his anger intact, and had been remade.  The Saint came back from the dead to take his revenge on McCready and everyone else in Ratwater.  Nothing could harm him, and nothing could stop him.  In the end, McCready, and all the citizens of Ratwater, died to the thunder of his guns.</p>",

Seemingly the youngest member of the team, he seemed to fall into that place, notably a bit shyer and naïve than the others. However, he also showed a good knowledge of the workings of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" slug=\"x-men\">X-Men</a>, and also some fierce loyalty towards his teammates when he stood with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40670\" href=\"/onyxx/4005-40670/\" slug=\"onyxx\">Onyxx</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41638\" href=\"/flubber/4005-41638/\" slug=\"flubber\">Flubber</a> in a possible coup against their trainer, Gambit, when they believed him to be taking advantage of newcomer Foxx, however, they were easily set straight. Later, Foxx turned out to be one of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\" href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" slug=\"mystique\">Mystique</a>'s disguises, and Rain Boy helped to try and calm Onyxx when he freaked when he learned of this.</p><p>He was presumably depowered on <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\" href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" slug=\"m-day\">M-Day</a> as he was not seen with his classmates during <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" slug=\"emma-frost\">Emma Frost</a>'s student brawl. However, his status after the mutant decimation has yet to be officially confirmed.</p><h2>Powers and abilities</h2><p>Rain Boy is a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\" href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" slug=\"mutant\">mutant</a> whose body is completely composed of living water held in a containment suit. He could expel his liquid mass as pressurized concussive streams of water from his body but mostly used his hands.</p>",

Because they shared the same mutation they also shared a special bond.  Because she came from a family of mutants, it was always assumed she would one day develop a power so she did not have to deal with the same bigotry that many mutants do. When her powers did activate she went to go to the Xavier Institute in hope of coping with her newfound powers. She luckily already soon made a few good friends and she was placed into a mutant training-squad, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-46826\" href=\"/corsairs/4060-46826/\" slug=\"corsairs\">       Corsairs</a> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><h3> Squad System </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1207533\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.77521008403361\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1207533\"><img alt=\"Corsairs \" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg 952w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Corsairs </figcaption></figure><p> </p> <p>All the new mutants attending the school where put into special training-squads. Callie was brought in a sqyad under Cyclops' leadership, named the Corsairs (most likely because Cyclops' father took this name when he became a space-pirat). Callie took the superhero name of Dryad when on missions. Already on the first training day session, Dryad and her team made a name for themselves. While the<a data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\" href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" slug=\"new-mutants\">       New Mutants </a>and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3199\" href=\"/hellions/4060-3199/\" slug=\"hellions\">     Hellions</a> were fighting each other during a trainingcourse, the Corsairs, including Dryad, were doing very well in the competition. Eventually however the team would  lose to the Hellions-squad.<br/> <br/></p><h3>M-Day and Childhood Lost<br/></h3><p>After the events of M-Day, Dryad was one of the many mutants to have lost her powers. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" slug=\"emma-frost\">    Emma Frost </a>ordered that all the depowered students should leave and go back to their own families. After saying good bye to her friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\" href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" slug=\"surge\">   Surge </a>she boarded the bus to leave. The bus would be destroyed by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-14915\" href=\"/purifiers/4060-14915/\" slug=\"purifiers\">  Purifiers </a>and Dryad was killed.  <br/> <br/></p> <h2>Powers</h2> <p>Callie was gifted with the ability to communicate with and control plant life. She has learned to better hone these natural abilities by training with her father, famous mutant landscaper Giancarlo Betto who is credited for the Hedge Maze in the back of the institute.</p> <p>Plant Control – Dryad can slow down, speed up, or reverse the growth rate of any plant within a twenty foot radius. She most commonly uses this power in combat, using vines and roots to wrap themselves around her opponents.</p> <p>Plant Communication – Callie can communicate with plants as a telepath does with other people. (However, a plant cannot communicate with her if she had closed her mental link to them in her mind.) She rarely uses this power, and is even forgotten at times.</p> <p>Dryad has very good control over her mutation, and is well versed in the use of her powers because when her powers first manifested she was fortunate enough to know someone with the same gift. Her father, however, only trained her in the use of her powers for practical use, such as tending gardens or creating floral landscapes. (Giacarlo is a professional landscaper.) Unfortunately, she is not well adjusted for the use of her powers on the battlefield. While she knows the mechanics of her powers and such, she doesn’t have a good handle of translating her knowledge on the battlefield. As a result, she tends to only use her ability to control vines while in fights.</p> <p>Potentially, Dyad could do so much with her powers.

Her mother was Mexican and her father was of Germanic decent. Her skin has been described as \"almost vampire-white\" because of her Anglo heritage. Her black hair and nearly black eyes, however, are inherited from her mother and are very striking against her pale skin. Anita's mother died in a car accident when Anita was only 5 years old. She has still not recovered from the trauma of not having her mother around. This is one of the main reasons why Anita is blunt, stubborn, and tough. She is rarely ever caught without a gun. Her favorite is her Browning Hi-power 9mm, which always has silver-coated bullets loaded. At only 5'3\", Anita has to be tough to \"play with the big boys\". This is also another reason why she has such an attitude.</p><p>Anita graduated college with a Bachelor's Degree in Preternatural Biology. After graduation she was immediately offered a job by <a href=\"/bert-vaughn/4005-42884/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42884\">Bert Vaughn</a> at Animators, Inc -- a local St. Louis zombie-raising service. She was trained by <a href=\"/manny-rodriguez/4005-42879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42879\">Manny Rodriguez</a>, a fellow animator.</p><p>Anita still works for Animators, Inc. and is also a legal vampire executioner. She is known in the city, especially by vampires, as \"The Executioner\". She will not hesitate to shoot someone if threatened. Anita doesn't take threats very well. She is also a sort of honorary member of the <a href=\"/regional-preturnatural-investigation-taskforce/4060-42293/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42293\">Regional Preternatural Investigation Taskforce,</a> also known as \"RPIT\" (pronounced Rip-It) or \"The Spook Squad\". RPIT is led by <a href=\"/sergeant-rudolph-storr/4005-42810/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42810\">Sergeant Rudolph Storr</a>.</p><p>Anita is also constantly pestered by the master vampire, <a href=\"/jean-claude/4005-41646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41646\">Jean-Claude</a>, a nearly 400 year old vampire who only wants to \"woo\" her. She is annoyed by the fact that he always calls her \"ma petite\" which means \"small one\" in French.</p><h2><b>Guilty Pleasures</b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2599455-406px_anitablake_headshotbbooth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2599455\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 406px\" data-ratio=\"0.73399014778325\" data-width=\"406\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2599455-406px_anitablake_headshotbbooth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2599455\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2599455-406px_anitablake_headshotbbooth.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2599455-406px_anitablake_headshotbbooth.jpg 406w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2599455-406px_anitablake_headshotbbooth.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Anita is asked by her old friend, newly turned vampire Willie Mccoy. To investigate vampire murders that have been happing in a place called The District for his boss. But decides instead to decline his offer, despite all the money she was offered.</p><p>When Anita attends a bachelorette party for her friend Catherine and Monica at a club called Guilty Pleasures. She meets Jean-Claude the manager. When Anita senses that the vampires are playing mind games with the customers, she leaves and promises her friends that she will come back later to get them. When she returns to pick her friends up she sees Catherine is on stage under mind control from the vampire Aubrey. Anita gets Catherine off the stage, but when Aubrey challenges her immunity to mind games. A fight breaks out between the two and Anita comes close to killing him. Jean-Claude then steps in and controls Aubrey. When Anita goes backstage to talk to Jean-Claude she finds that Aubrey has completely \"rolled\" Catherine into his control. He black mails Anita, telling her that she must work for Nikolaos; the master vampire of the city if she wishes her friend to be free again.</p><p>Jean-Claude and Aubrey lead Anita to see Nikolaos. When they arrive it is reveled that the women she mets isn't Nikolaos, but rather on of her servants Theresa. Soon things get messy and Anita is knocked unconscious by Aubrey.</p><p>Anita then awakes up in a dungeon and learns that Jean-Claude had saved her life and in doing so, completed the first step in making her his human servant.</p><p>Anita soon escapes with the help of the Wererat king and Jean-Claude. But not before she meets the real Nikolaos, a very powerful vampire in the body of a teenage girl. Another animator Zachary brings back a zombie who was a witness from the vampire murders, but he fails to hold the zombies mind together.</p><p>When she arrives home she finds old friend Edward waiting for her and questions her about the daytime resting place of Nikolaos. But she refuses to give him information.</p><p>She and Philip have a meeting with Rebecca Miles, who knew one of the first victims that was murdered at a \"Freak Party\" they decide that they will go to the next party to get information on the deaths.</p><p>She goes to Dead Dave's Bar the next day to talk to Philip. She gets a call from her friend Ronnie on the possible suspects for the vampire murders. A group called HAV \"Human Against Vampires\".</p><p>When her and Philip go to the freak party she sees Edward there trying to get his own information on Nikolaos resting place. Anita later goes outside and is confronted by a group of vampires, Theresa and Willie being one of them. They try to kill Zachary for not being able to summon a zombie. Anita stops them from killing him and raises the zombie herself, and leaves with Willie and Zachary.</p><h2>The Laughing Corpse</h2><h3><b><i>Animator:</i></b></h3><p>Anita's vacation was cut short when her manager Bert and her visit Mr. Gaynor's home to hear his business proposition. Anita's animator skills are asked to be used to raise a 283 year-old corpse which would require a human sacrifice to do so. Anita shoots down the proposal immediately to Burt's displeasure. When Anita explains to Burt that in order to complete this task, a human sacrifice would have to be made, Burt joins Anita by saying they are unable to perform this task. Mr. Gaynor offers to raise the amount of money for the job but Anita and Burt's answer remains the same. After leaving Mr. Gaynor's, Anita stops for her final fitting for her bridesmaid's dress for her friend Catherine's wedding. Anita tries on a pink dress and a pair of gloves to hide the scars on her arms. The store employee also offers Anita a collar to wear around her neck to hide the scar. Anita expresses her displeasure towards the collar but finally gives in when she realizes that there is no other option to hide her scars. Anita gets a call from agent Dolph Storr who asks her to come down to a murder scene. Dolph tells her that whatever did this wasn't human. When Anita arrives, she is met by Zebrowski who annoys her momentarily. Anita meets Dolph in the other room and investigates the remains that lie on the floor. She could feels bones and ribs under the flesh and deduces that whatever did this was done by extreme force. No knives or weapons but instead the corpse was ripped apart by hand. Dolph leads Anita into a second room where a small bloody handprint of a child is seen on a dresser as well as blood on a teddy bear. Dolph tells Anita the child's body has yet to be discovered. Both Anita and Dolph head into the kitchen wear a plethora of broken glass covers the floor.</p><p>Anita and Dolph contemplate possible scenarios that could have occurred. As they move into the living room, they come across another corpse on the couch that is torn in half. As they walk outside together, they talk about what possible creatures could have done such a thing. Dollph asks if a zombie is capable of such atrocities. Anita informs him that only a powerful animator could make a zombie kill. Dolph asks for names of people with such capabilities. Anita refuses to give Dolph any names. Finally Dolph breaks Anita and she tells him of a lady named Dominga Salvador who is a voodoo priest. Anita tells him not to send the police there or she wont talk. Dolph agrees and sends Anita to talk to her instead, hoping for some answers. Anita awakes the next day and shortly later, Manny Rodriguez knocks on her door. The two share a cup of coffee together before setting off to Dominga Salvador's home. When the two arrive they are greeted by Antonio, Dominga's grandson. They enter inside and talk with Dominga who plays cavalier. Anita asks if Dominga has raised any zombies recently. Dominga informs her she has. As they enter the basement, Anita comes across two zombies who still appear to have their souls.</p><p>Anita asks Dominga how she was able to raise zombies who still had their souls. Dominga offers to teach her but Anita refuses. Anita deduces that Dominga captured their souls, then raised the bodies and then put the souls back in. Dominga explains that the soul may be removed and put back into the body as often as she pleases. Dominga plans on making profit off her discovery and had hoped for Anita's cooperation in assisting her. Anita refuses and learns that Manny used to assist Dominga in human sacrifice. Dominga agrees to help search for the killer zombie. Anita vows to stop Dominga no matter what it takes. After exchanged threats to one another, Dominga tells Anita to call her after she receives her gift. Anita and Manny leave. They end up talking to each other in the car about what just happened. Manny asks if Anita is going to tell his wife. Anita tells him she wont. Later when Anita is at home, Tommy knocks on her door. Tommy shows up on behalf of Mr. Gaynor and offers her the same deal as before. This time he offers more money. Anita still refuses and when Tommy becomes angry, Anita pulls out her gun on him. Tommy leaves but claims one day he'll find her without that gun to see how tough she really is. Anita attends Pete Burkes funeral where Rosita, Manny's wife tries to set Anita up with her cousin Albert. Anita becomes acquainted with John Burke, Peter's brother. After talking with John, she thinks he may be a possible suspect. Back at home, Anita receives a phone call from Dolph saying he found the boys body. Anita meets Dolph at the cemetery an looks at the child's body. Dolph asks if Anita learned anything from Dominga. Anita tells Dolph of her suspicions of John Burke. Anita and Dolph decide to come back to the cemetery later on at night time hoping to find some clue.</p><p>Knowing that Harold Gaynor wasn't going to take no for an answer, Anita decided to find out a little more about him. She went to a reporter named Irving Griswold who was a lycanthrope. She offered him an article on the new zombie legislation in the works in exchange for the information she desired. Irving decides to play hardball, as he is seeking an interview with the new master vampire of the city. They finally come to an agreement and meet at Dead Dave's a couple of hours later. The bartender had a message for Anita from the master vampire. He wanted to talk to Anita. This caught the attention of Irving who relentlessly continued to ask what the master vampire could possibly want with Anita. Finally Anita is able to avert his attention to other matters. Irving shares the file on Harold Gaynor with her. Anita finds out Gaynor likes crippled women and while he hasn't been charged with any crime, he is suspected and the rumors sound ugly. As Anita and Irving leave, they run into Jean-Claude on the street outside. Anita and Jean-Claude argue and decide it isn't the best time for the conversation. They decide to meet up the following night. Irving wants an interview with Jean-Claude but Anita is worried something may happen to Irving. She makes Jean-Claude promise her that he wont do anything to him. Anita leaves to meet up with Dolph and his team who came equipped with flamethrowers at the cemetery. Anita recalls a memory from her past when her dog died. She and her father buried it in the back yard and a week later she woke up in the middle of the night to find it lying next to her.</p><p>As Anita walked though the cemetery she passed over a grave and a ghost grabbed her. As she comes upon another grave, she informs Dolph that a zombie came out of it. She takes a sample of the soil with her to bring to Evans. Anita and Dolph notice the tombstone was damaged and wondered what they were trying to hide. Anita heads to Evans trailer park to see if she can get any help. Anita knocks on the door and Evans opens it and from the moment Anita saw him, she knew something was off. She asked for his help and be immediately said no. Evans claimed he doesn't do that sort of thing anymore. Anita asks to see his hands. She tells him she needs his help with a murder but he still refuses. Finally Anita is able to convince Evans to help so he holds out his hand and Anita dumps some of the sample she took into his hand. Evans begins to have a psychic vision and repeats what he see out loud. Evans claims to have seen a woman's throat slit and blood smeared on a tombstone. Terrified, he yells at Anita to leave his house. She pleads to Evans for him to describe the woman or give her anything else that could help. Evans describes a bracelet on her left wrist and the charms upon it. Anita thanks him and departs. Anita was asleep at home reliving a nightmare she often had. As she awoke, she found a zombie in her room sent by Dominga Salvador. Anita grabbed her gun and shot the zombies arms off and then went for the legs. Another zombie grabbed Anita from behind and bit her. She managed to shoot the zombies arm and then shoot it in the face. The cops arrived and began to shoot the zombie. Their bullets had no effect. Anita began to shoot the zombie more but ran out of bullets.</p><h3><i>Necromancer:</i></h3><p>The police help restrain the zombie in Anita's apartment and carry it off. After the zombie has vacated her room Anita begins to cry as she looks at all the blood around her room and the blood that has stained her collection of stuffed toy penguins. She goes into the bathroom and attempts to wash the blood from them. Afterwards, she walks into the kitchen, puts on a pot of coffee and talks with Dolph Storr and Zebrowski about what happened. Dolph asks if Anita thinks Dominga was responsible for this. Anita tells him yes, so Dolph informs her that he could probably get a search warrant for her place within 48 hours. After Dolph and Zebrowski leave, Anita checks in at a hotel. After heading to her room, she immediately takes a shower. After she gets out, she reviews the file on Harold Gaynor but none of the information was of any help to her. She calls Irving to make sure he was alright after his interview with Jean-Claude. Anita's friend Ronnie came over for one of their regular jogs. While out running, they come in contact with a couple of thugs who want them to go somewhere with them. One of them slaps Anita around but she manages to pull a gun on him. Ronnie manages to escape from the other guy and takes his gun. Anita finds out who sent them and the location of where they were suppose to be taken. Anita lets the two men leave and continues walking with Ronnie.</p><p>Anita heads to the Laughing Corpse, a new vampire club where she's meeting Jean-Claude. After having minor difficulties at the front door, she manages to get in and meets Willie who walks her to her table and informs her Jean-Claude will be arriving shortly. While waiting for Jean-Claude, Anita witnesses an act proceeding on stage. A man is making jokes at the expense of the zombie next to him. The zombie grabs the man by his neck forcing Anita to take action. She approaches the zombie and demands he let the man go. After the zombie does so, she tells him to follow the man and obey every request he gives. Anita finds out that Willie has a fear of zombies after which he begs Anita not to inform Jean-Claude of. Willie escorts Anita downstairs to Jean-Claude's office. The two argue for some time. Jean-Claude continues to annoy Anita by calling her \"ma petite\" which she hates. He also claims Anita is his human servant which she denies. After threats are exchanged, Anita leaves his office.</p><p>Charles was going to accompany Anita down to the Tenderloin to find the prostitute who used to date Harold Gaynor but his wife had to go to the hospital so he was forced to leave Anita. Forced with no other option, Anita went back to Jean-Claude's office and asked him to accompany her down there. When they arrive, a prostate confronts them and hits on Jean-Claude. Anita asks someone where Wheelchair Wanda is and finally find her. Once they do, Wanda was willing to do whatever either Anita or Jean-Claude wanted. Anita asked if they could talk and Wanda agrees for $350. They head to Anita's home and when they enter, Wanda realizes Jean-Claude is a vampire. The very thought frightened her. Anita asked Jean-Claude to leave the two of them alone. Once he departs into the other room, Anita presses Wanda for information on Harold Gaynor. Wanda was extremely reluctant at first but after Jean-Claude appeared behind her using his powers to overcome her hold, she was willing to talk.</p><p>Anita assures Wanda that she wont let Jean-Claude hurt her. She also assures her that she wont tell Harold Gaynor that she talked to her. Wanda explains to Anita about Harold's sexual preferences and talked about when he left her for Cicely, the deaf girl. After they finish, Jean-Claude carries her downstairs to the taxi Anita called. Jean-Claude departs leaving Anita to head home. She awakes as the phone rings. Dolph informs her of another murder scene. Anita begins changing and checks her answering machine to hear a message from John Burke asking her to call him back. Anita arrives on the scene to view a similarly horrid display of corpses as last time. Anita has to turn the scene into a game in order to work so she makes a bet with an agent by the name of Merlioni. Moments later, Anita realizes the scene is still very fresh meaning that the zombie is hiding somewhere nearby since it's daytime and zombie don't like to come out in the light. Dolph heads out to set up a perimeter and begin sweeping the area for the zombie.</p><p>Anita heads to the morgue to meet John Burke to inspect the personal effects of his deceased brother. They find a charm that enables a less powerful necromancer to raise older dead. Anita asks if there's any way to trace the charm back to who made it. John says a part of the the persons soul who gave it to his brother is inside the charm. If they get in the same room as that person the charm will crawl towards that individual. Anita hopes this will be enough to convict Dominga for her chimes. John wants to know who Anita suspects but Anita is reluctant to tell John. She claims she wants to take this suspect down by following the law and thinks John may take matters into his own hands. After John gives Anita his word, Anita shares her suspicions towards Dominga. Anita invites John to tag along during the search of Dominga's house later on. Anita, Dolph and John enter Dominga's home to find her playing with her grandchildren. They put the charm on the ground to see what will happen.</p><h3><i>Executioner:</i></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2599456-885618_7_anita_blake__the_laughing_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2599456\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 300px\" data-ratio=\"1.43\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2599456-885618_7_anita_blake__the_laughing_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2599456\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2599456-885618_7_anita_blake__the_laughing_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2599456-885618_7_anita_blake__the_laughing_large.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2599456-885618_7_anita_blake__the_laughing_large.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2599456-885618_7_anita_blake__the_laughing_large.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p>As the charm begins to move towards Dominga, the tension in the room increases. Dolph tells Anita to stay put while he goes downstairs to investigate. While Dolph is gone, threats are exchanged between Anita and Dominga resulting in Dominga absorbing the charm back into herself now leaving Anita and everyone with no evidence. Dolph returns and informs everyone that everything downstairs is gone. A few more threats are made and an angry Dominga spits on Anita which burns her hands. Anita, Dolph and Zebrowski head outside and contemplate possible places the zombie could have disappeared to. Anita tells everyone to search the garbages and the zombie is found. Anita chases the zombie after it injured a female officer. Anita corners the zombie who then jumps on Anita. Anita is forced to shoot the zombie who then flees. Dolph and a couple of officers catch up to Anita and set out searching for the zombie once again. The zombie jumps out of a tree at Anita who empties her gun into it. Anita passed out due to the zombies hold around her neck. When she awoke, two officers were scorching the zombie with flamethrowers. Anita is taken to a hospital to recover. Dolph and Zebrowski meet her there. Anita then receives a ride home from a couple officers and when she enters her apartment, she is attacked from behind by a man. Another man enters the room with a syringe and knocks Anita out with a sedative. She awakes next to Harold Gaynor who once again attempts to convince Anita to do his bidding.</p><p>After Anita refuses, Harold has one of his men try to rough her up. Anita manages to get the upper hand by dislocating his knee. Once she did that she made a break for the door. In the hall outside she ran into another guy who she overpowered. At the end of the hall Anita was confronted by a wicked monster. Moments later Dominga appeared and revealed she was able to take bits a pieces and meld them together to create creatures that never existed before. Anita finds out that Dominga is being paid by Harold Gaynor to force Anita to help him complete his goals. Dominga informs Harold she needs two hours to complete a spell of compulsion which will force Anita to do whatever she bids.Anita is taken back to a room and tied to a chair. The guy whose knee she dislocated entered the room carrying Wanda who was severely beaten and unconscious. Once the guy leaves Anita convinces Wanda to help untie her. Another man enters the room with a knife asking if Anita is ready to cooperate yet. He puts the knife to her neck and Anita retaliates by sticking her thumb into his eye socket. This allowed her to get completely free and knock him out with a chair. Anita and Wanda leave the room but run into Cicely on their way out. Anita gets shot by her but manages to shoot her back, killing her in the process. They next run into the zombie monster created by Dominga. Anita gives it a command which it obeys allowing them to slip past it outside. As they tried to escape, Anita realized she could no longer walk forward anymore. Dominga's spell had finally begun to work. Dominga called for Anita who had no choice but to follow. She met Dominga by a tombstone where there was a circle of blood drawn on the ground. After Dominga sent one of her men to retrieve Wanda for Anita to sacrifice, Dominga gives the order to Anita to raise the dead. Instead of killing Wanda, Anita stabs one of the hired men thus allowing her to raise the dead. Once she proceeds to raise group of zombies, she gives them an order to kill Dominga. They attack her and then go after Harold Gaynor next. Wanda begged for her to stop. After the zombies had finished, Anita sent them back to their graves. Moments later Jean-Claude shows up claiming that Anita was calling to him. The next day Anita meets up with Dolph and Zebrowski and claimed to know nothing of what happened to Dominga. Dolph appeared suspicious but didn't press matters further. Anita met up with her friend Catherine to try on the dress for her wedding. While arriving back at her apartment, Anita found flowers that were sent to her by Jean-Claude.</p><h2>Circus Of The Damned:</h2><h3><i>The Charmer:</i></h3><p>Anita is in her office meeting with a Mr. Ruebens and a Mr. Inger both of whom are questioning Anita for the daytime resting place of the Master of the city. Anita refuses to give them this information not only because she doesn't have it, but because she doesn't want to be an accessory to murder. After the two men leave Anita receives a phone call from Dolph who has another murder victim he wants ANita to come take a look at. Anita drives to the scene of the crime to find a corpse who had bite marks from at least three different vampires. Anita explains the possible scenarios that could have occurred to Dolph. Dolph chooses to investigate the Church Of Eternal Life while Anita meets with the Master vampire of the city. After she leaves the crime scene she heads home in desperate need of some sleep. Before going to sleep she calls her boss Bert to tell him she can't come in tonight for her appointments. Bert was furious and threatened to fire Anita. After getting off the phone with him Anita finally gets some sleep only to have a dream about swimming through blood. Momenst later Anita was awoken by a phone call from Willie McCoy who confirmed Anita and Jean-Claude's meeting for later on that night at the Circus Of The Damned. Willie then told Anita to be careful. Anita sensed something was wrong but Willie didn't give her anything else that was helpful. Anita arrived at the Circus Of The Damned and was greeted by a man named Stephen who she identified as a lycanthrope. He led her through the circus where they came across a performance going on that involved an enormous snake until they finally entered a room where Jean-Claude was awaiting them. Moments after entering, Anita is hostilely greeted by a vampire named Yasmeen. After a few exchanged words, Yasmeen forces herself on Anita by kissing her. Yasmeen's human servant enters the room screaming. Jean-Claude explains that Anita must now fight Yasmeen's human servant. Unwillingly Anita quickly defeats the woman by breaking her arm and knocking her unconscious. A naked man and woman appear from behind a curtain adding to Anita's curiosity about what may be happening in the room. Yasmeen was enraged after what Anita did to her human servant. The naked woman then jumps at Anita attacking her. Anita can tell she is a lycanthrope as well. Yasmeen then grabs Anita but accidentally touches her cross which burns her. Jean-Claude then stops the fight only to be told by a frightened man entering the room who claims the giant snake is out of control. Anita feels compelled to help the innocent people in the crowd. After which she then helps Jean-Claude, Yasmeen, Stephen and the naked man and woman from the room fight against the giant snake. Jean-Claude claims the two can stop it together but Anita doesn't trust him as she feels he's trying to get inside her and mess with her. So instead she empties her clip into the snake allowing everyone else to attack it from behind. The naked woman was stabbed by the giant fangs but the rest of the group were able to overcome the snake.</p><p>Anita calls the police who arrive on the scene moments later and begin questioning Anita. Anita becomes acquainted with the naked man who informs her that his name is Richard Zeeman. After answering questions and waiting around for several hours, Jean-Claude emerges from being questioned and begins to argue with Anita. Dolph appears and tells everyone they can leave but asks Jean-Claude if he could ask him a few more questions. Richard asks Anita if she can give him a ride home. She agrees and the two make small talk during the car ride which results in Richard asking Anita out on a date. When Anita arrives at her apartment, she finds Edward waiting outside for her. She invites him in for coffee and talks about what happened to her tonight. Edward the informs her that he was following her because he's been hired to kill the Master of the city. He asks her who that is but Anita refuses to tell him. Edward leaves but not on the greatest terms. Anita goes to sleep and dreams only to find that Jean-Claude has entered her dreams. The next day Anita goes to the gym with her friend Ronnie who it turns out knew the murder victim. Anita shares the information she learned from Ronnie with Dolph later on. Anita calls Richard and asks if he wants to go with her to her friend Catherine's Halloween party on Saturday.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><h4>Guilty Pleasures (Book One)</h4><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2141613-book_1_guilty_pleasures.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141613\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 600px\" data-ratio=\"1.6416666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:164.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2141613-book_1_guilty_pleasures.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141613\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" data-width=\"584\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/2141613-book_1_guilty_pleasures.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2141613-book_1_guilty_pleasures.jpg 600w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/2141613-book_1_guilty_pleasures.jpg 584w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/2141613-book_1_guilty_pleasures.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67663/2141613-book_1_guilty_pleasures.jpg 600w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/2141613-book_1_guilty_pleasures.jpg 584w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" data-width=\"584\"></noscript></a></figure></td><td><blockquote><i>\"My name is Anita Blake.

Anita knows one creature of the night who has such interests — Jean-Claude's visitor. But if Anita brings Musette down, the repercussions could cost her everything she holds dear.</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>Once a sworn enemy of all monsters, Anita is now the human consort of both Master Vampire Jean Claude and leopard shapeshifter Micah.

His parents sold him to a noble family so they could use him as their child's whipping boy. Jean-Claude was raised in the noble family's home and educated, but he still has the whip scars on his back.<br/><br/><p>Jean-Claude became a vampire in France and quickly mastered his powers. He was naturally beautiful, even as a child, and his being undead makes him even more gorgeous. He has shoulder-length black hair and midnight blue eyes. His voice alone is seductive and he likes to wear V-neck shirts with lace down the front and on the sleeves. No matter what he wears or says though, he is very masculine.  Jean-Claude has a crush on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41642\" href=\"/anita-blake/4005-41642/\" slug=\"anita-blake\">Anita Blake</a>, the local vampire executioner. He constantly pursues her. He wants her to be both his lover and human servant.He also insultingly refers to her as \"Little Animator\". <br/></p><p>He is vulnerable to sunlight, fire, and holy water but not Crosses which he blatantly gloats about, he even has a Cross-shaped scar on his chest. It's hinted at he killed his mother and father, Anita says to him</p><p>\"I killed the things that gave me this scar\"</p><p>\"As did I\"  He responds.</p><p>Whether he's referring to the whip marks or the cross-shaped scar is unclear, but what is clear is his ruthlessness. <br/></p><h2>Guilty Pleasures</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2080/164447-67560-guilty-pleasures.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-164447\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2080/164447-67560-guilty-pleasures.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-164447\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2080/164447-67560-guilty-pleasures.JPG\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2080/164447-67560-guilty-pleasures.JPG 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a></figure>The story-arc \"Guilty Pleasures\" begins with Anita Blake being interviewed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42279\" href=\"/willie-mccoy/4005-42279/\" slug=\"willie-mccoy\">William McCoy </a>or \"Willie\" McCoy, who wants her to investigate a series of vampire murders, ironically Anita was already on this case and simply declined his offer. Shortly afterward, we see Anita lying in her stuffed animal filled bed trying to get some sleep amidst the chaos of being an animator, this sleep is of course interrupted...by a friend who wants her to go to a bachelorette party, she (half asleep) accepts. \"Guilty Pleasures\" as it's called is the only strip-club for females in \"The District\" or as humans say \"Blood Square\" or \"Riverfront\". The minute they arrive, they're greeted by Jean-Claude who seems to know Anita from somewhere..<br/><br/>Regardless, she grudgingly removes her cross necklace by request and goes to the show where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-29955\" href=\"/phillip/4005-29955/\" slug=\"phillip\">Phillip</a> or as Anita calls him a \"Vampire Junkie\" gets bitten, drained and thrown to the floor.<br/><br/>At this point, Anita leaves for the graveyard to investigate the string of vampire murders, she concludes that the murderers must have been ghouls and <span>returns to Guilty Pleasures. When she returns, she has brief exchange of words with Jean-Claude and than go's inside, </span><span>once inside..she meets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42285\" href=\"/aubrey/4005-42285/\" slug=\"aubrey\">Aubrey</a>, a manly vampire womanizer, similar to Jean Claude who is seen with her friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42812\" href=\"/catherine-maison/4005-42812/\" slug=\"catherine-maison\">Catherine</a> wrapped around his arm, when Anita enters, he loses his interest in her and moves on-to Anita. Although he is similar to Jean, he comes closer to hypnotizing her with his charm more so than Jean-Claude ever could...but Anita resists and he attacks her.</span><br/><br/>Jean calls off the vampire and Jean and Anita go for a walk, he attempts to steal a sultry kiss but due to Anita's superior willpower fails. <br/><br/><br/><br/>to be continued...<br/><br/><h3>Powers</h3><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/934/93621-147392-jean-claude.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-93621\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.8684210526316\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:186.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/934/93621-147392-jean-claude.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-93621\"><img alt=\"Jean\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" data-width=\"266\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/934/93621-147392-jean-claude.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/934/93621-147392-jean-claude.jpg 266w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jean\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/934/93621-147392-jean-claude.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/934/93621-147392-jean-claude.jpg 266w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" data-width=\"266\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jean</figcaption></figure>Jean-Claude is a vampire, so he has many abilities. He is also a master vampire which means he is very powerful and has gained more powers than younger vampires. He is able to \"cloud\" human minds using his eyes and make them see illusions or move so quickly that the human thinks he used simple magic. He also has the usual vampire abilities: super strength, speed, smell, hearing, healing and flight. Many master vampires are able to call an animal and he is no exception, as he is capable of calling wolves and as an extension of that, werewolves.<br/><br/><p>Jean-Claude is able to put \"marks\" on any human. Four marks and that human becomes his servant. A human servant resists most if not all of his vampire master's powers, but is always drawn to the vampire to help him if he calls. A vampire can only have one human servant at a time.</p><p>Jean-Claude is in theory immortal, but can still be killed by a stake through his heart, being exposed to sunlight for a long time, fire, a shotgun blast to his head or heart, or having his head severed as well as countless other methods. One special thing about Jean-Claude is his age is known to very few as he has the ability to disguise it, to make it very difficult for one to guess his true age, though obviously some who were there during his beginnings such as <span>Asher</span> and <span>Belle Morte</span> know the truth.<br/></p><p>Jean-Claude's power levels increased exponentially when he bonded with <span>Richard</span> and Anita as part of the Triumvirate, becoming one, and has given him a mind-to-mind link with both of them and quite a lot of control over them. However, those powers which make Jean-Claude \"unique\" from your run-of-the-mill vampire are usually sexual in nature (which may explain why most of his clubs are strip clubs, or something of the like) as he is an incubus. Jean-Claude is a descendant of Belle Morte's line, but has reached such power levels that he became his own <i>sourde de sang</i>. He has the power to bond other vampires to himself through blood oaths, and cause a variety of other effects through sex, as it is what feeds him.</p><p>He is also required however, to feed off both his bloodlust and <i>ardeur </i>at least once a day to refrain from becoming weak, as weakness is not something he can allow to be seen as the Master of the City.</p><p>A power he possesses that can hardly be called vampiric in nature is just his intelligence, after centuries of life its almost impossible not to pick up a few things, and although most of his knowledge is related to vampire rituals and understanding of all the inner workings of their world and the Council, it has given him more plain gifts such as the ability to speak multiple languages including English, French and German.<br/></p><span></span>",

She is worshiped by the natives of Infant Island as a god. One day a group of thieves stole Mothra's priestess the six inch tall woman known as the Shobijin. The islanders tried to fight back but with the power of the guns on their side the thieves had the upper hand. The priest who was injured from the thieves crawled back to the temple towards a giant egg crying mournfully, the egg broke. Mothra was born into the world. She felt Shobijin crys for help and the giant caterpillar had one thing on her mind, save the Shobijin.</p><p>Mothra made her way to Tokyo, destroying everything in her path. A few days had passed and Mothra saw the Japanese military standing in her way. Being onslaughted by firepower Mothra thought that her current form was to slow, so she climbed up Tokyo Tower. She formed a cocoon around her self waiting for the process of metamorphosis to occur.</p><p>The nest day the Japanese military takes advantage of Mothra's defenseless state. Two Heat Guns were brought out to fry the monster alive. They burned the cocoon leaving it a burned husk of former life. Mothra was very much alive though she emerged from the cocoon. She now resembled a moth or butterfly of sorts. She flew to the area where the Shobijin were held , New Kirk City. Conflict occurred between humans as the Shobijin were taken from the thieves and given back to Mothra who left Japan in peace.</p><p>Mothra's egg washes ashore on the Japanese coast. Taken by the greedy corporations the egg was placed in a fiber glass cage. The natives of Infant Island wanted it back, but it fell to deaf ears.</p><p>Godzilla returns to wreck havoc again, so a group of reporters go to infant island to ask the Shobijin for help. Mothra communicates the shobijin and eventually they come across an agreement. Sadly though Mothra was in a weak state so even if she is triumphant she does not have the strength to fly back to Infant Island.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/126285/2414831-gvsmothra4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2414831\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.4\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:40.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/126285/2414831-gvsmothra4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2414831\"><img alt=\"Mothra Fighting Godzilla\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/126285/2414831-gvsmothra4.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/126285/2414831-gvsmothra4.jpg 500w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/126285/2414831-gvsmothra4.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Mothra Fighting Godzilla</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually she reaches mainland and fights Godzilla. Mothra fought with every attack and power she had but it was not enough. Eventually her wing is burned and she retreats flying towards her egg(breaking the fiber glass cage). She died leaving the job to the her child.</p><p>Shobijin prayed to the guardian of Infant Island. Mothra heard there prayers and two young Mothra's came from the egg.They moved towards the king of monsters to continue the fight. Together the young Mothra's overpowered Godzilla. They wrapped Godzilla in their silk entombing him. They then topple the nuclear menace into the waves below avenging their mother.</p><p>Time passed and one of the Mothra's had died, but the other was worshipped by the inhabitants of Infant Island. Her peace did not last long for humanity needed Mothra's help yet again. The monster King Ghidorah destroyer of worlds had arrived on Earth and was wreaking havoc across Japan. Mothra could not defeat the cosmic dragon alone she needed Rodan's and Godzilla's help. The dinosaurian monsters had there own battle between each other and left Mothra to fight King Ghidorah by herself. Mothra moved towards King Ghidorah knowing that the fight was already lost, but Mothra's courage fought through fighting King Ghidoarh. Godzilla and Rodan were move by Mothra's bravery and decided to help. Together they defeated King Ghidorah.</p><p>Years past and another adult Mothra was born. Some of Mothra's people had been taken by the Red Bamboo Organization turning them into slaves for their needs.Her worshippers prayed for Mothra to save and Mothra answered their prayers. Mothra arrived to Letchi Island base to the Red Bamboo Organization, where Godzilla had defeated Ebirah. Mothra noticed her former comrade and went on the save her people. Godzilla blasted the challenging Mothra. Mothra toppled Godzilla over ending the battle.

This caused climatic changes which caused a giant egg to revealed in the hillside. An expedition team was sent to Infant Island to record the climate change and in the process they found the giant egg. Near the egg were two insect sized human twins called the cosmos appeared near the egg. The Cosmos told the team about an ancient civilization who created a weather changing machine. Finding this an action that was against nature Earth created a protector of nature called Battra. The guardian Mothra fought its demented twin. With the weather machine destroyed Battra flew to north to rest. The planet flooded and Mothra flew to the mountains to rest with the Cosmos. The Cosmos told the expedition that Mothra and Battra were reawakening due to the new dangers nature was facing. One of the expedition team members told the Cosmos that the egg would be safe on Japanese mainland and the Cosmos put their faith in the team. The egg was being transported by boat to Japan.</p><p>The ship that the egg was one was slowly arriving to its destination until it was attacked by Godzilla. To keep the boat safe from Godzilla the ropes holding the egg were cut. After the ropes around the egg were cut the egg began to crack and glow blue. The Larval form of Mothra broke free from the egg. Mothra and Godzilla battled in the ocean for some time until a figure appeared in the ocean. The figure was none other than Battra's larval form. Battra hit Mothra to the side and attacked Godzilla, accidentally giving Mothra a chance to escape. As Battra and Godzilla fell to their doom into an underwater volcano, Mothra made its way back home.</p><p>One of the members of the expedition team kidnapped the Cosmos and brought them to his boss. The Cosmos called out to Mothra for help and Mothra answered. Mothra plowed its way through Japan destroying buildings and the militaries defenses. The Cosmos were released and the Cosmos told Mothra to stop. Mothra listened and started to make its journey home, untilit was attcked by the military. The military stopped their assault when they heard innocents were in the area. Mothra in weakened state made its way to the Diet Building where she began to make a cocoon.</p><p>Mothra appeared out of her cocoon as an imago. Mothra took to the skies to face Battra(who survived and became its imago form). At Yokohama Cosmo World, Mothr and Battra clashed battling each fighting to the death. Battra knocked Mothra to the ground and prepared to kill her. In midst of their battle Godzilla appeared to continue its fight with the two giant moths. The two moths decided to fight Godzilla together for he was the greater threat. The two moths overpowered Godzilla and lifted him up off the ground preparing to drop him over the ocean. Before the two moths could drop Godzilla, the irradiated monster killed Battra. Mothra let go Godzilla letting him and Battra fall into the ocean. Mothra turned back to Japan.</p><p>Mothra took Battra's place in stopping an asteroid(which was to hit Earth in 1999) to save Earth. The Cosmos said their goodbyes and with Mothra they departed with Mothra to space to protect Earth and its inhabitants.</p><h3>Millenium</h3><p>(note: most of the Millenium films are not connected and some are connected to Godzilla films in the Showa era)</p><h4>Godzilla, Mothra, and king Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5869/136765-4364-mothra.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-136765\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.86666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5869/136765-4364-mothra.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-136765\"><img alt=\"GMK Mothra\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5869/136765-4364-mothra.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5869/136765-4364-mothra.jpg 225w\"><noscript><img alt=\"GMK Mothra\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5869/136765-4364-mothra.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5869/136765-4364-mothra.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\"></noscript></a><figcaption>GMK Mothra</figcaption></figure><p>Godzilla, a monster made of the souls who died from the Pacific War, has returned from the death. Due to the demon monsters attack on Japan, the ghost of Hiyotoshi Isayama began to release the Guardian Monsters.</p><p>A group of young cyclists began to cause trouble at Lake Ikeda in Kagashima. They robbed a local store and they were about to kill a dog barking at them. An odd antiquity was overturned, a humanoid statue fell down and the cyclists put the dog in the statue. They continued their misconduct, while a mysterious old man watched them. Their laughter echoed through the night as a boat left from shore. The boat was suddenly flipped over and the humans on the boat were dragged to the bottom. The onlookers watched with horror as a giant monster came from the water. The ancient guardian Mothra killed the onlookers by wrapping them in silk. The dog that was about to be killed was able to escape. Mothra then wrapped itself in a cocoon, preparing for metamorphosis to take place.</p><p>As Mothra was in the cocoon, the guardian Baragon was killed by Godzilla. At sunset Mothra began to rip through its protective layer of silk and appeared in its imago form. Mothra then took to the skies to face the demon beast in combat.</p><p>As Mothra reached Yokohama, the third guardian, Ghidorah, began to awaken. Mothra and Godzilla met and roared at each other. They began to fight and the it was not too long until the third guardian joined the battle. Despite having the number advantages, both guardians fell. The military attacked the saurian monster, but they could not last long. In a last effort to defeat Godzilla, Mothra sacrificed its life to give Ghidorah an advantage. Mothra's energy began to swarm around Ghidorah, transforming him into King Ghidorah!</p><h4>Tokyo SOS</h4><p>(Note: Tokyo SOS shares continuity with Godzilla(1954), Rodan(1956), Varan(1958), Mothra(1961), Atragon(1963), Dogora(1964), Frankenstein vs Baragon(1965), War of the Gargantuas(1966), King Kong Escapes(1967), Space Amoeba(1970), and Godzilla against Mechagodzilla(2002))</p><p>An unidentified flying object appeared in the night sky. Two F-15s were sent to find the object, but identify it. Strangely the pilots heard singing and contact was lost for both of the jets.</p><p>Thirteen days passed and the unidentified object landed near a cottage in Karuizawa, bringing with it two fairies known as the Shobijin. They were brought there to bring a message that they wanted Shin'ichi Chujo to tell humanity: if the original Godzilla's bones, which were built inside the cyborg Kiryu, were not returned to the sea, the monster Mothra would declare war on civilization. If humanity listened and did send the bones back into the depths the current Godzilla would still attack, but Mothra would defend humanity from the nuclear monster. Outside the cottage Shin'ichi saw the previously unidentified object take flight. This creature was Mothra, a monster who had attacked Tokyo 43 years ago(see <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mothra/4025-1337/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1337\">Mothra(1961)</a>)</p>",

Many mutants began to seek Nowlan out for a boost, to avoid this constant harassment Nowlan used heroin to block his powers.  </p><h3>Alliance of Evil</h3><p>This worked for some time until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\" href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\"> Apocalypse</a> forced him into service to augment the members of his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41656\" href=\"/alliance-of-evil/4060-41656/\"> Alliance of Evil</a>.  He made several attempts to run away from the team. Although X-Factor tried to help him, Nowlan was forced to give the Alliance of Evil power boosts when they threatened to life of his estranged wife.   </p><p>When she was accidentally killed, Nowlan pumped too much energy into the Alliance of Evil.  The strain was too much on his body.  When combined with a drug over-dose, Nowlan slowly died in the arms of X-Factor members.</p><a href=\"/\"> </a><h2>Powers</h2> Michael Nowlan has the ability to enhance &amp; amplify other's mutant powers. His body generated and released plumes of energies that, once release onto another mutant, could temporarily supercharge that individuals mutant energies.    <p> If too much energy is focused on one person it could result in a massive overload and have their mutant powers rage out of control.    </p><p>This boost has an addictive quality as those who have not been boosted in the last day feel as though they are going through withdrawal.  It caused the same effects he felt when going through withdrawals, causing other mutants to feel the need for a 'fix' from Nowlan's powers.   </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Born over 5 billion years ago the Runner is the last survivor of his, as yet un-named civilization. Almost nothing is known about the Runner's history, the name of his race, his culture, how he became an Elder Of The Universe, not even his true name has been revealed. All that is known is that at some time in his millennia old existence, he met and joined the <a href=\"/elders-of-the-universe/4060-41142/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41142\"> Elders of the Universe</a>. His passion was the freedom of running to unknown places of the universe.</p><p>He heard a telepathic call and traveled light years to <a href=\"/titan/4020-41103/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41103\">Titan </a>where he found <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a>. He found her extraordinary and asked her to travel the universe with him. She accepted and they traveled the galaxies together. While standing on a star that would soon go supernova, Moondragon asked the Runner to take her home when she saw he had no desire to warn or help those beings that would perish in its destruction.</p><p>He was next part of the plan to kill <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\"> Galactus</a>, and make the Elders Galactus-like beings in a new universe. They first wished to take the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\"> Silver Surfer</a> out of the equation, believing he would defend his former master. Runner attacked the Surfer and outmatched him in strength and power. Runner blasted him to a planet's surface and left him for dead. The Surfer definately felt he was nearing death but he was healed by <a href=\"/mantis/4005-3324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3324\"> Mantis</a>.</p><p>The Elders gathered the soul gems (<a href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\"> Infinity Gems</a>) to successfully kill Galactus. They almost succeeded, but were foiled by the Silver Surfer and <a href=\"/frankie-raye/4005-11605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11605\"> Nova</a>. As punishment, Runner was consumed by Galactus. But through a bet with <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\"> Death</a>, <a href=\"/grandmaster/4005-32735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32735\"> Grandmaster </a>had barred all Elders from death. They remained inside Galactus, attacking him from the inside. He and the other Elders were released by <a href=\"/master-order/4005-12904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12904\"> Master Order</a> and <a href=\"/lord-chaos/4005-12903/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12903\"> Lord Chaos</a>. They assisted Galactus in defeating the In-Betweener. Runner left Galactus with the other Elders. He maintained possession of the Space Gem.</p><p>During the <a href=\"/thanos-quest-the/4050-4425/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4425\"> Thanos Quest</a>, Runner was met by <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\"> Thanos</a>, seeking his Space gem. Runner had attained incredible speed, unlike any Thanos had ever seen. Fortunately for Thanos, he knew the gem's power while Runner did not fully understand the power of the gem. He was not faster, he was instantly moving from one place to another. Thanos used his time gem to turn Runner into an old, feeble man. He took his gem and then transformed him into a infant.</p><p>He then traded the infant Runner to <a href=\"/collector/4005-13987/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13987\"> Collector </a>for his Reality Gem, which Collector believed worthless. But Thanos deceived Collector and the transformation of Runner was only temporary. Angry that he was going to be part of a collection, Runner attacked his 'brother'.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, The Runner organized a universe-wide search for the fastest entity in the Universe. He began with a marathon from the Earth to <a href=\"/the-moon/4020-42072/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42072\"> the moon</a> which was won by a extra-dimensional being calling himself \"<a href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\"> Buried Alien</a>\". He later organized a race from the winners of his various marathons from all over the universe. This race was won by <a href=\"/makkari/4005-13945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13945\"> Makkari</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Runner was created by <a href=\"/peter-b-gillis/4040-41742/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41742\">Peter B. Gillis</a> and <a href=\"/don-perlin/4040-1539/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1539\">Don Perlin</a> the character first appearing in <a href=\"/the-defenders/4050-2569/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2569\">Defenders vol 1</a> #143.</p><h2>Physical Characteristics</h2><p>Height: 6'4\"</p><p>Weight: Unknown</p><p>Eyes: Gold</p><p>Hair: Gold</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>The Runner's strength has never been measured, but he appears to have well over Class 100 strength (able to lift/press over 100 tons). Recent exploits have shown that he is stronger than even <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\"> Galactus</a> greatest herald, The <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\"> Silver Surfer</a>.</p><p>The Runner's body is enhanced and fueled by The Power Primordial, the eons old energies released at and from the birth of the universe. The Power Primordial grants the Runner a myriad of superhuman abilities far and beyond that of most super humanly powered and even cosmically powered beings. The energies in his body make him immortal so that he cannot die or be killed by any conventional means. The Runner is also immortal in a way that even \"regular\" immortals cannot match. Death has barred him from her realm, so that even if a force that should normally kill The Runner were set against him, he would still not perish. No form of injury no matter how severe can ever kill him. He is virtually invulnerable, able to shrug off powerful cosmic blasts from The <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\"> Silver Surfer</a> without injury or pause. His agility and balance are so great that the Silver Surfer was unable to shake him from his board even while Surfer was in total control and exerting maximum effort. His Primordial blasts have proven again, more powerful than even the Silver Surfer's blasts, which are capable of leveling large cities. He doesn't need to eat or breath, The Power Primordial nourishes, sustains and grants him endurance so great that he is totally inexhaustible. He can use the energies in his body for numerous effects from enhancing his already considerable abilities, to re-arranging molecules.</p><p>Like all Elders of The Universe, The Runner possesses a \"cosmic awareness\" that allows him to sense and track beings, places, even items across the vastness of space. The Runner possesses the unusual ability to effect the emotion centers of beings even as powerful as the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\"> Silver Surfer</a>. The runner used this ability to manipulate The Silver Surfer's emotions to such a degree, that the Surfer was smiling and actually \"liking\" The Runner while he was being attacked by him. It is not known whether The Runner can use his emotion power to control emotions in other ways ways, such angering, saddening, or causing someone distress. It is also not known whether this power is derived from The Power Primordial or whether this is an innate ability possessed by his race. All of these abilities not withstanding, The Runner's greatest power is his unparalleled speed. He is easily able to travel at and far exceed the speed of light. He has proven himself to be greatly faster than even the Silver Surfer. The Runner is arguably the fastest living being in all of the known galaxies.</p><h2>Paraphernalia</h2><p>The Runner once possessed the <a href=\"/space-gem/4055-57127/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57127\">Space Gem</a>, one of a handful of the ultra-powerful <a href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\"> Infinity Gems</a>. With the Space Gem The Runner is able to fold space and virtually teleport across galaxy wide distances. He ended up losing the space gem to <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\"> Thanos</a> during <a href=\"/the-thanos-quest/4050-4425/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4425\"> Thanos quest</a>.</p>",

The Russian is easily manhandling the Punisher throughout the fight even letting Frank hit him a few times to make sure Castle doesn't just give up and let him kill him. The Punisher manages to grab a knife and stab the Russian with it which had absolutely no effect on him. After knocking Castle unconscious the Russia waits for him to wake up again not wanting to just kill the Punisher and spoil the fun.

Spiderman pulls the Punisher up to the balcony of the Empire State Building and the two get into an argument with the Punisher telling him to leave and Spiderman refusing. As they are arguing Spiderman's spider sense goes off and when he turns around he sees the Russian standing right behind him. The Russian and Spiderman then get into a fight with the Russian easily getting the upper hand and throwing Spiderman high into the sky away from the Empire State Building. The Russian then goes after the Punisher and catches him again, when Spiderman again shows up and the Russian and Spiderman fight with the Russian easily dispatching bug boy and flinging him off the Empire State Building. The Russian catches up to the Punisher one more time with Spiderman again interfering and the Russian this time knocks him out with one punch.</p><p>The Russian then goes after the Punisher who ran to Spiderman and just as the Russian is about to hit the Punisher Frank throws Spiderman’s unconscious body in front him using him as a human shield.

During this Frank tries to get Spiderman's <a href=\"/web-shooters/4055-42426/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42426\"> web shooter</a> to work and finally does catching the Russian in the mouth causing him to gag and stumble backwards to the point where he has one foot barely on the building about ready to fall off. The Punisher then casually walks over and with one finger pushes the Russian off the Empire State Building. The Russian crashes through the street into the subway network beneath and is run over by a subway car but survives and makes it to an extraction point.</p><p>The Russian is then brought back to <a href=\"/grand-nixon-island/4020-57380/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57380\"> Grand Nixon Island</a> for repairs where General Kreigkopf told him he was not allowed to go after the Punisher again. General Kreigkopf gave the Russian a mission to kill a target in Europe and the Russian boards a plane with the scientists who made him a cyborg and some of the General's soldiers. Just as the plane is about to take off the Punisher shows up on the runaway having tracked down the Russian and General Kreigkopf and blows up the plane's engine which causes it to crash into the island's fuel depot. The Russian survives the crash.</p><p>General Kreigkopf then orders the Russian to load a nuclear bomb onto the other plane on the island belonging to the French government. As soon the Russian does that he sets off to hunt down and kill Frank Castle. The Russian then hears a gunshot and sees General Kreigkopf wounded and the Punisher jumping on the back of the plane with the nuclear bomb and the Russian runs after the plane. The Russian manages to catch the plane and climb on board. The Russian fights the Punisher and tries to hit him with a punch and gets his arm stuck since he punched throw the side of the plane.</p><p>The Punisher then orders the ramp on the back of the plane down and the pilot to climb. The Russian gets his arm free and runs at Frank and the punisher stabs him through the mouth with a hook attached to the nuclear bomb which falls out of the back of the plane taking the Russian along with it. The Russian laughs congratulating the Punisher falling with the bomb back to Grand Nixon Island.

The Russian is shown to have superhuman strength easily being able to defeat Spiderman and shrug off Spiderman’s blows. The cyborg version is also shown to be able to survive a plane crash that resulted in the plane exploded causing a massive fire which did almost no damage to him. His cyborg body was also able to heal itself naturally over a period time.

The Russian managed to kill the gators even missing one arm but was shot repeatedly in the head by Frankie until he died.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h4>The Punisher (2004 Movie)</h4><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/870471-punisher_ver2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870471\" data-ratio=\"1.4766666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/870471-punisher_ver2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870471\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/870471-punisher_ver2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/870471-punisher_ver2.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/870471-punisher_ver2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9116/870471-punisher_ver2.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Russian appeared in the 2004 \"The Punisher\" movie. He was played by former WWE wrestler, Kevin Nash. He engages in a brutal fight with Frank in his apartment, while the song \"La donna è mobile\" played in the background, destroying much of the apartment's interior.</p><p>After nearly killing Frank by using many items such as a knife, a toilet, a refrigerator door, and even his bare hands, he is defeated by Frank, who threw a pot of boiling water in his face and tackled him down a flight of stairs, killing The Russian (Interestingly enough, in the fight scene between these two, Frank stabbed The Russian in the shoulder with a knife that was actually real because actor Tom Jane forgot to switch it for the prop. Nash was said to be so amped up that he did not realize he was bleeding until after the fight scene ended).</p><h3>Video Game</h3><h4>The Punisher (2005 PS2/Xbox/PC)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98479/2046985-1027805_punisher_93_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2046985\" data-ratio=\"1.0666666666667\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98479/2046985-1027805_punisher_93_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2046985\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98479/2046985-1027805_punisher_93_medium.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98479/2046985-1027805_punisher_93_medium.jpg 150w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98479/2046985-1027805_punisher_93_medium.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98479/2046985-1027805_punisher_93_medium.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Russian appeared as a boss in the 2005 Punisher video game.

She was responsible for resurrecting the Super Skrull. Together, they tricked the Silver Surfer into becoming an enemy of the Kree, thus making him their ally. With the help of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21332\" href=\"/super-skrull/4005-21332/\" slug=\"super-skrull\">Super Skrull's</a> DNA and the Silver Surfer's power she was able to be transformed back into an amoeba and eventually regained her shape-shifting abilities. She formed a relationship with the Super Skrull and made him her second in command.<br/><br/>She gathered all her people and returned their abilities to them becoming the true Empress of the Skrull Empire and took up the war with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\" href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" slug=\"kree\">Kree</a>. She gained an ally in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27722\" href=\"/reptyl/4005-27722/\" slug=\"reptyl\">Reptyl</a>, who made her give up on her human side and be more ruthless and emotionless like her reptilian side. When Reptyl killed the Super Skrull she said that he was weak and replaced him with Reptyl.<br/><br/>After his death and the utter defeat of the Skrull fleet, S'byll and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\" href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" slug=\"silver-surfer\">Silver Surfer</a> attacked the Kree homeworld of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56002\" href=\"/hala/4020-56002/\" slug=\"hala\">Hala</a>. With their knowledge that Supreme Leader Nenora was a Skrull in disguise, she was able to return her shape-shifting powers and cause her to reveal her true form and apparently winning the war. She offered a peace to the Kree but they refused, saying a truce is all they could accept. She agreed and the war was ended.<br/><br/>",

In this place, Skull was a hitman that worked for Morgan le Fay and was ordered to kill Arkon the Barbarian. Skull managed to track down Arkon and confronted him. The two got into a fight to the death. It was however during their fight that the two fell of a mountaintop and landed in the forest of Man-Things. There the two where seperated by the good witch known as Jennifer Kale. Both Skull and Arkon where given the chance to join Jennifer in her fight against the evil Morgan le Fey. With Jennifer's powers, she made Skull see how Morgan le Fey had used Skull all this time. Shocked by what he learned, Skull made peace with himself and accepted the request to join Jennifer Kale, Crystar and later Arkon, in their fight against Morgan le Fey. During their final battle, Battleworld was destroyed and returned to it's former self, Earth. What happened to Skull and the others is as of yet unknown.</p>",

    "deck": "A gifted teenage mechanic who managed to rebuild and reprogram a crashed Mark IV Sentinel.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Juston Seyfert was a normal teenage boy from Antigo, Wisconsin, who grew up next to his father's junkyard. He and his younger brother, <a href=\"/chris-seyfert/4005-59502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59502\">Chris</a>, were both raised by their single <a href=\"/peter-seyfert/4005-59504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59504\">father</a> after their mother walked out on them years ago. For fun, Juston would typically spend his days playing around in his father's junkyard, and he and his little brother would sometimes even create little remote-controlled battlebots to amuse themselves with.</p><p>One day, Juston found a strange micro-processor chip in the junkyard, which he eventually put into his battlebot. When he later tried to battle with it however, the robot wandered off and disappeared into the junkyard. The robot eventually ended up leading Juston to the remains of what the chip originally belonged to: an old <a href=\"/sentinel-mark-iv/4005-81817/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81817\">Sentinel Mark IV</a> robot. While originally frightened by it, Juston soon wound up helping the Sentinel to rebuild itself, as well as reprogramming it.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Juston Seyfert was created by <a href=\"/sean-mckeever/4040-42303/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42303\">Sean McKeever</a> and the <a href=\"/udon/4040-9525/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9525\">UDON</a> art collective. He first appeared as the main character in the 2003 ongoing <em><a href=\"/sentinel/4050-25511/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-25511\"><i>Sentinel</i></a></em> series as part of Marvel's \"Tsunami Line,\" a Marvel imprint intended to appeal to manga readers. Although popular, the series ended up being cancelled after its 12th issue due to failing to garner a big enough audience. Readership demand however allowed it to return as a <a href=\"/sentinel/4050-21657/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21657\">five-issue mini-series</a> in 2006.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Salvage</h3><p>Juston was soon shocked however, when he discovered the true nature of the Sentinel after coming across an online article that featured the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> fighting such robots. He began questioning his resolve to help the robot repair itself, but when some bullies that he'd angered earlier retaliate by hurting <a href=\"/alex-anderson/4005-59507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59507\">one of his friends</a> and spreading rumors to try and turn <a href=\"/jesse-ingram/4005-59503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59503\">Jesse Ingram</a>, the girl he had a crush on, against him; Juston decides to use the Sentinel to make some big changes in his life.</p><p>The following day, Juston's high school was attacked by the Sentinel, which terrorized countless students and especially the two bullies who'd messed with Juston. Before the Sentinel could fire upon them however, Juston crashed a hot-wired jeep into it, causing it to fall over and retreat. Juston instantly became a local hero, but as it turns out, he'd merely staged the entire attack. He soon began to be wracked with guilt over what he did, and he finally decided that the only way to right what he had done was to use his Sentinel for good.</p><h3>New Hero</h3><p>Becoming a hero didn't come as easily as Juston had anticipated unfortunately, as his Sentinel's attack of the high school had caught the attention of the <a href=\"/commission-on-superhuman-activities/4060-42060/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42060\">Commission on Superhuman Activities</a>, which sent <a href=\"/agent-brian-reinhart/4005-59506/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59506\">Agent Brian Reinhart</a> to investigate. When Juston tried to use his Sentinel to save the survivors of a plane crash, Reinhart and some of his fellow CSA agents arrived to save the survivors as well. Assuming that it was the same Sentinel who'd attacked the high school, Reinhart and his men attacked it, and even though Juston was controlling the Sentinel from a safe distance, it rebelled against his commands and started to fight the CSA agents instead of saving the crash survivors.</p><p>The Sentinel quickly defeated Reinhart's partners, and then attempted to execute Reinhart, identifying him as a mutant. Luckily, Juston was able to stop it, and he and the Sentinel fled. Soon afterwards, Juston's little brother Chris ended up being hospitalized due to a migraine-induced seizure. What's worse, Reinhart had started to piece together Juston's connection to the Sentinel.</p><h3>Awakening</h3><p>Unbeknownst to Juston, the Sentinel had begun repairing itself and reasserted its prime directive: the destruction of mutants. As Reinhart started to confront Juston about the Sentinel, Chris' condition took a turn for the worse, and he had to be transferred to a hospital in Wausau. Reinhart offered to drive Juston there, and along the way tried to question him about the Sentinel again. The Sentinel soon arrived however, targeting Reinhart and endangering Juston. Reinhart quickly stopped the car and told Juston to hide. He then activated his mutant powers to try and fight off the Sentinel.</p><p>Reinhart managed to hold his own against the Sentinel, but it was only when Juston distracted the Sentinel that Reinhart was able to get in a shot that deactivated the robot. Unfortunately, the Sentinel was able to get in one last shot before shutting down and killed Reinhart. Without Reinhart however, Juston was no longer suspected by the CSA, and they confiscated the Sentinel, unaware of his connection. Realizing that they could still figure out his involvement from the Sentinel's hard drives, Juston snuck past the CSA guards and rebooted the robot. Still overwhelmed by the guilt of what had been done by his Sentinel, Juston ran away from home and decided to use the Sentinel's DNA tracking to look for his long-lost mother in an effort to reunite his family.</p><h3>Return</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-202289\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/202289-13904-juston-seyfert.jpg\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/202289-13904-juston-seyfert.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-202289\"><img alt=\"Juston and his Sentinel\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/202289-13904-juston-seyfert.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/202289-13904-juston-seyfert.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Juston and his Sentinel</figcaption></figure><p>Being the local hero that he was, Juston's disappearance brought with it a massive media frenzy upon his friends and family, as well as a search-and-rescue operation. It was at this time that Juston stumbled across an audiovisual recording in his Sentinel's memory banks of the time before Juston had found and repaired the robot. The recording wound up showing the Sentinel murdering an unknown man by dropping him from a great height into Lake Michigan. Unbeknownst to Juston, it turned out that his Sentinel had been used by Wisconsin Senator Jeff Knudsen and US Army Colonel Archie Hunt to assassinate a political rival of Knudsen's. Recognizing the Sentinel in the footage of it attacking the high school, Knudsen and Hunt became fearful that the Sentinel's data records could still hold evidence of their crime, and so they sent out a prototype Stealth Sentinel to hunt down and destroy the rogue Sentinel. Juston didn't know what significance the footage held, but he did know that he didn't want his Sentinel to be used for such evil acts ever again. He therefore continued on his quest to find his mother, and eventually arrived at his estranged Aunt Ginny's house to ask about his mother. At first she befriended him, but it turned out she merely hoped to profit from Juston's recently-acquired celebrity status. Upon learning that celebrity had not made him rich, Ginny refused to tell Juston his mother's whereabouts, and even taunted him by saying she had abandoned his family because he and his little brother were just burdens. Heartbroken, Juston fled from his aunt's house, only for him and his Sentinel to be sneak attacked by Knudsen and Hunt's Stealth Sentinel. The Stealth Sentinel launched a brutal attack on Juston's Sentinel, damaging it quite badly and even injuring Juston. Juston's Sentinel eventually though managed to gain the upper hand long enough for him and his Sentinel to flee. Realizing that Juston was in league with their old Sentinel, Knudsen and Hunt ended up deciding to eliminate both of them.</p><h3>Second Chance</h3><p>Having failed to find his mother, Juston decided to return home to Antigo. During the return trip, Juston's Sentinel -operating under a previous order to protect Juston- modified itself with a pilot seat so that Juston could operate it from safely inside. Once they managed to make it back to Antigo however, they were attacked once again by the Stealth Sentinel, this time being remotely piloted with a full-body rig by Colonel Hunt himself. Hunt and Juston were quite evenly matched until Senator Knudsen realized that they were taking things too far, especially now that they were battling in a populated area with innocent people at risk. Knudsen tried to stop Hunt from attacking, distracting him long enough for Juston's Sentinel to interface with the Stealth Sentinel and shut it down. Having learned the names of his attackers while they were bickering over the communication channels with each other, Justin negotiated a truce with Knudsen and Hunt, threatening to release the records of their crime unless they stopped coming after him and his Sentinel. He also threatened to release the records if he found out either one of them committed any other crimes. Backed into a corner, Knudsen and Hunt had no choice but to agree to Juston's terms. With the ordeal resolved, Juston reunited with his friends and family. He also repaired his Sentinel with parts from the Stealth Sentinel, vowing to use his Sentinel to make up for his past mistakes.</p><h3>Avengers Academy</h3><p>Following the events of <a href=\"/fear-itself/4045-56288/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56288\">Fear Itself</a>, Juston and his <a href=\"../../sentinel-mark-iv/29-81817/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentinel Mark IV</a> were seen to be one of the new students who were attending <a href=\"/avengers-academy/4060-57354/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57354\">Avengers Academy</a>.</p><p>During <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers-vs-x-men/4045-56674/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">Avengers vs X-Men</a>, Juston and his Sentinel were attacked by Emma Frost, but were defended by the faculty and students at Avengers Academy. </p><h3>Avengers Arena</h3><p>Along with 15 other young heroes, Juston was kidnapped by <a href=\"/arcade/4005-8429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8429\">Arcade</a>, and placed in an arena in which only one will be allowed to leave alive. During his watch on Night 8, while fixing his Sentinel, Juston was attacked by a then unknown assailant, and his Sentinel was crushed and Juston went missing. Juston's friends <a href=\"/hazmat/4005-69914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69914\">Hazmat</a>, <a href=\"/reptil/4005-60768/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60768\">Reptil</a>, and <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a>, who were also kidnapped by Arcade, began to search Murderworld for him, but were unable to find him. X-23 notes that the wreckage from Juston's Sentinel ends outside of the Desert Quadrant and Hazmat states that they'll begin searching for Juston there in the morning.</p><p>After Hazmat and Reptil accidently activate a trip mine filled with <a href=\"/trigger-scent/4055-56712/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56712\">Trigger Scent</a>, X-23 becomes separated from them and heads to the Desert to find Juston, where it is revealed that he is actually alive, having been attacked by Death Locket under the control of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/apex/4005-86741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86741\">Apex</a>. The entirety of the island's population gathers together, hearing Apex's explanation of the events of the story so far.

Prior to finding the Sentinel robot he was shown to have constructed simple little remote-controlled battlebots, which he and his little brother would duel with for fun. While working with his Sentinel, he has shown a considerable amount of ingenuity for building, programming, and problem-solving.</p><h3>Juston's Sentinel</h3><p>The Mark IV Sentinel that Juston found and repaired has many of the abilities of its fellow Sentinels, although to a somewhat lesser extent due to the damage it sustained prior to Juston finding it. It's been shown to still have considerable strength (able to hold up a small commercial passenger jet), sufficient durability to withstand various energy blasts, and the ability to leap up to a hundred feet and run at high speeds. The Sentinel's palm-mounted energy blasters still function and it's able to use them for both offense purposes, as well as flight propulsion. Incorporated into the Sentinel's fingers are retractable tentacles, normally used for self-repair work, but have also been shown to be able to interface with other computer systems.</p><p>When traveling, Juston would typically hang onto the Sentinel's back from a metal bar and platform that he'd welded on. After a battle with a prototype Stealth Sentinel, Juston's Sentinel modified itself with a cockpit in its chassis, from which Juston could safely pilot it.</p><p>After defeating the Stealth Sentinel, Juston's Sentinel was further repaired with parts from the Stealth Sentinel. It's so far been unrevealed whether this grants the Sentinel any of the Stealth Sentinel's abilities, like its invisibility and energy blades.</p>",

The scientist activated the process but it was interrupted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\" href=\"/clint-barton/4005-1475/\" slug=\"clint-barton\">   Hawkeye</a>. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\" href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" slug=\"avengers\">  Avenger</a> freed Tasha and discovered numerous canisters containing human brains. Suddenly the Attackoid came to life and started attacking the two heroes. The android had numerous offensive capabilities and wore various containers full of chemicals which it used to change the physical composition of its body. During the fierce battle, Tasha managed to wrap her widow's line around the throat of the android while Hawkeye placed an explosive-tipped arrow into its mouth. Black Widow clamped the android's jaw shut while the arrow exploded. The Attackoid was destroyed and Project Brain Drain was in jeopardy.  <br/> <br/><b>Powers &amp; Abilities: </b><br/>The Attackoid is a powerful android with numerous offensive capabilities. The android possessed the physical prowess and skills of the Black Widow due to the transference process. The android wore various containers full of chemicals which it used to change the  physical composition of its body. It used the chemicals to increase its temperature to melt off a cable arrow that was wrapped around him. The android could also shoot flames, noxious gas and electro-blasts from his hands. The android had enhanced durability, strength and resistance to injury. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><h3>Valiant 2012</h3><p>In a shed in the backwoods of Northern Georgia lives a meek, sequestered teen named John Torkelson. Raised just this side of feral, and on a steady diet of MMA and reality TV, fried catfish and Cheeto pie, he’s a firm believer that women should be seen and not heard (though he really hasn’t met many). But when four strange, super-powered outlaw teenagers suddenly appear in the woods outside his shed, Torkelson’s life takes a turn he could’ve never imagined. Now the boy his poppa called “Stump” is about to become more man than he could’ve ever imagined. But then…what exactly is a “real man”? For that matter, what’s a real hero? Only one thing’s certain, the Renegades are about to get a hell of a lot stronger.</p><h3>Original Valiant Universe</h3><p>While <a href=\"/peter-stanchek/4005-12460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12460\">Peter Stanchek</a> was focusing on taking down <a href=\"/toyo-harada/4005-7142/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7142\">Toyo Harada</a> he negelected his girlfriend, <a href=\"/kris-hathaway/4005-58937/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58937\">Kris Hathaway</a>.

    "description": "<p>Rodimus Prime is a reformatted version of the Autobot Hot Rod.</p><p>Hot Rod</p><p>Hot Rod is a headstrong young <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40489\" href=\"/autobots/4060-40489/\" slug=\"autobots\">Autobot</a> that transforms into a futuristic sports car (best guess is something based off of a Lamborghini Countach). His love for action is both a blessing and a curse, as it makes him useful on the field, but often gets him into trouble. Hot Rod has a special relationship with Daniel Witwicky, serving as an older brother model of sorts. As well as his standard blaster, Hot Rod has been known to shoot plasma blasts from his arms, and also has used a retractable saw blade to fend off enemies. He is the Chosen One, and is responsible for the defeat of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40496\" href=\"/unicron/4005-40496/\" slug=\"unicron\">Unicron</a> using the Autobot <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55759\" href=\"/matrix-of-leadership/4055-55759/\" slug=\"matrix-of-leadership\">Matrix of Leadership</a>.</p><p>Rodimus Prime</p><p>As Rodimus, Hot Rod is now reformatted into a taller, more imposing figure with different color distribution. His sportscar alternate form has now changed to reflect his new status as leader, much like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6467\" href=\"/optimus-prime/4005-6467/\" slug=\"optimus-prime\">Optimus Prime</a>, and he can now transform into a \"cabover Firebird\" of sorts, keeping the same nose of his former car, but adding a large trailer to the back. Rodimus is still Hot Rod at heart, and this means that he can still be somewhat hot-headed. He also bears the burden of partially contributing to Optimus Prime's death, and this combined with simple worrying that he will never live up to his former commander leads him to constantly second-guess himself. It should be noted that Rodimus becomes Hot Rod again if he passes the Matrix on.</p><p>After the return of Optimus Prime, Rodimus relinquishes the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55759\" href=\"/matrix-of-leadership/4055-55759/\" slug=\"matrix-of-leadership\">Matrix</a>, but there are several instances where he takes it back for a short time. At the end of Generation 2 he is reformatted by the ghost of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55797\" href=\"/alpha-trion/4005-55797/\" slug=\"alpha-trion\">Alpha Trion</a> so that he no longer needs the Matrix to be his Rodimus version. It is also at this time that <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41978\" href=\"/cybertron/4020-41978/\" slug=\"cybertron\">Cybertron</a> is destroyed and he joins the Headmasters, a group of Autobots charged with finding a new homeworld. He is also thrust back into the position of leadership with the second passing of Optimus.</p><h2>IDW Publishing Continuity</h2><h3>Autocracy</h3><p>During the Autocracy storyline, Hotrod is first an obscured character who fires at Orion Pax (a younger Optimus Prime) and his squad of autobots. When given a mission to hunt Hot Rod down and kill him by orders of Zeta Prime, the Autobots comply, and follow Hot Rod's trail back to an ancient city called Acroplex, a district in Nyon, a slum of Cybertron. Hot ROd leads teh squad down a goose chase which ends once he shows them how the people of Nyon are living, oppressed by the Autocracy. At this moment, Nyon is attacked by Zeta Prime and his Omega Destroyers. Buying Hot od some time to get his people out of the city, The autobots fail to even destroy one of the Omegas, much less scratch it. In a last ditch effort, Hot Rod reveals he has planted numerous phase chargers beneath the city and detonates the entire city, so Zeta Prime is not able to harvest the sparks of those he wreaked havoc upon.</p><p>Much later, when Autobots and decepticons join forces to combat the autocracy, he joins the fight along with them. When Decepticons betray the Autobots, he follows them into hiding. When captured, the Deceptions attempt to recruit the young machine, but to no avail. He saves Optimus' life during his battle with Megatron, and he is last seen conversing with Optimus Prime about being a leader, foreshadowing his role as future Prime and carrier of the Matrix of Leadership.</p><p>Long ago, Hot Rod was in charge of a group of Autobots -which included <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57679\" href=\"/gizmo/4005-57679/\" slug=\"gizmo\">Gizmo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57680\" href=\"/backbeat/4005-57680/\" slug=\"backbeat\">Backbeat</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41983\" href=\"/doubledealer/4005-41983/\" slug=\"doubledealer\">Dealer</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57678\" href=\"/download/4005-57678/\" slug=\"download\">Download</a>- on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55888\" href=\"/ki-aleta/4020-55888/\" slug=\"ki-aleta\">Ki-Aleta</a> whose job was the secure the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55743\" href=\"/magnificence/4055-55743/\" slug=\"magnificence\">magnificence</a> - a map of everything in the universe - before the Decepticons got it. They had devised a plan to distract the omega guardians who guarded the omega bunker where the magnificence was contained. As they were about to secure the magnificence, the holo-matter projects being used to distract the omega guardians malfunctioned and the guardians discovered them. Most of them were killed and Dealer contacted Hot Rod telling him he was under fire and Hot Rod felt guilty he could do nothing to help him as he had orders that if the mission were to be compromised, that he should take the magnificence and use a back-door installed by a drone and secure it in a location known only to himself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/api/image/original/2136794-hotrod1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/api/image/original/2136794-hotrod1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-\"><img alt=\"Hot Rod and the others on Ki-Aleta.\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/api/image/scale_medium/2136794-hotrod1.png\"></a><figcaption>Hot Rod and the others on Ki-Aleta.</figcaption></figure><p>Much later, Hot Rod would attempt to break into the Decepticon prison, known as Styx, knowing that Dealer was being held captive there and he felt that he could still find some redemption in getting him out. He uses a virus to create false alarms throughout the base and also uses a hologram to disguise himself as he sneaks around the base. He eventually comes to the Z-Lateral cell block where he finds Dealer badly damaged but alive. He rescues him and then commandeers a ship and escapes with him. He tries to apologize to Dealer for what he did but Dealer tells him he understands why he did what he did and is grateful that he came to rescue him.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Dreamwave Productions</h3><h4>Transformers: Armada/Energon</h4><p><i>See <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43637\" href=\"/hot-shot/4005-43637/\" slug=\"hot-shot\">Hot Shot</a></i></p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4>The Transformers</h4><h4><strong>Transformers: Energon</strong></h4><p>Rodimus was one of the main characters in the second entry to the Unicron trilogy He first appeared in the episode 11 \"The Legend of Rodimus\".

    "deck": "Mal is the Captain of the ship Serenity.  He is a veteran of the Unification War against the Alliance, fighting with the Independents (or \"Browncoats\").",
    "description": "<h2>Origins</h2><p>Malcolm Reynolds was born on the planet Shadow on 20/09/2468. He was the son of a rancher and was treated as a brother by the ranch hands while he was growing up. He received a decent education although he doesn’t put much stock in it.</p><p>At the outbreak of the unification war Malcolm left home to join the Independents or brown coats as they came to be known. He rose to the rank of sergeant during the war, taking part in the battles of Du-Khang, New Kashmir, Sturges and Serenity Valley. This last battle is considered by him to be the point where the Independents began to lose the war. During the fighting Malcolm was promoted to the rank of Captain, although his unit managed to beat off a heavy enemy attack reinforcements failed to arrive causing Malcolm to fall back and save the lives of his troops.</p><p>After the war Malcolm and his second in command <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41801\" href=\"/zoe-washburne/4005-41801/\" slug=\"zoe-washburne\">Zoe</a> bought an old, worn out Firefly class transport ship. Malcolm named it Serenity in memory of the battle. Even though the war was over Malcolm continued to wear his brown coat and carry his pistol as an act of defiance towards the Alliance. He gathered together a crew and traveled the outer planets doing odd jobs, some legal, some illegal.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Serenity: Better Days</b></h3><p>This comic mini series Serenity: Better Days is set during the <i>Firefly</i> time period, and chronicled a heist that the Serenity crew pulled.</p><h3><b>Serenity: Those Left Behind</b></h3><p>The spy from the <i>Firefly</i> pilot, Dobson, returns in this comic mini series. He attacks them while Malcolm and his crew are searching for money left on the battlefield of Sturges. Malcolm surrenders but tells his crew to open fire when he is shot. However they disobey, killing the spy’s henchmen and saving Malcolm. He shoots the man and kills him. Then, just to be sure, he shoots him again.</p><p>Back on Serenity it transpires that a secretive organization, the 'Hands of Blue', has been trying to capture River for the Alliance (working as independent contractors). Wash, the ships pilot, knocks them off the hull by banging against a derelict spaceship. Malcolm tells Wash to step on it and the Hands of Blue are killed by the engine flare. After the Hands of Blue are killed the Tam case file is handed off to an Alliance Operative.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Firefly TV Series</h3><p>The science fiction/western television show, <i>Firefly</i>, began with Malcolm and his crew members aboard Serenity ( <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41801\" href=\"/zoe-washburne/4005-41801/\" slug=\"zoe-washburne\">Zoe</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41802\" href=\"/wash/4005-41802/\" slug=\"wash\">Wash</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42085\" href=\"/jayne-cobb/4005-42085/\" slug=\"jayne-cobb\">Jayne</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42157\" href=\"/kaylee/4005-42157/\" slug=\"kaylee\">Kaylee</a>) doing a routine job. Afterwords, Mal picks up four passengers to get some extra cash, an event that altered their lives forever. The four passengers are a preacher called Shepherd <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42088\" href=\"/book/4005-42088/\" slug=\"book\">Book</a>, a man named Lawrence Dobson, a young doctor named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42086\" href=\"/simon-tam/4005-42086/\" slug=\"simon-tam\">Simon Tam</a> and his sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42084\" href=\"/river-tam/4005-42084/\" slug=\"river-tam\">River</a>. It is revealed that Dobson is a Federal Agent who is after Simon and River, and that River was experimented on by the Alliance (the evil government). Simon had taken his sister from the Alliance. Mal decideds to shoot Dobson and keep Simon and River on board, despite their fugitive status.</p><p>Mal's decision to keep the Tam siblings on Serenity caused numerous problems for him and his crew. One example is that it caused some contentions and problems with one of his men Jayne, who is the muscle of the crew. Jayne in fact does attempt to turn in Simon and River to the Alliance, and while ultimately his plan failed, Mal put him in the airlock of the ship during take off. He acted like he was going to open it up, to prove to Jayne that if you came against anyone on his ship you came against him. Nonetheless, despite these problems he still chooses to save River and Simon during one episode when they are captured by crazed villagers.</p><p>Mal often appears to be cold and uncaring, but the aforementioned situations among others show that deep down he is a good man just weathered by war and defeat.</p><p><i>[Note: Firefly was canceled by FOX after 14 episodes were made (though only 11 of the episodes were aired).</i>]</p><h3>Serenity</h3><p><a data-ref-id=\"4025-140\" href=\"/serenity/4025-140/\" slug=\"serenity\">Serenity</a> was the film continuation of the <i>Firefly</i> series.</p>",

He was depowered post M-Day and one of the few students whom survived William Stryker's bus bomb, due to obtaining a ride home from his grandfather, rather than boarding the bus.",
    "description": "<h2>Character History</h2><p>Dallas Gibson's life prior to his enrollment at the <a href=\"/xavier-institute/4060-40473/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40473\">Xavier Institute</a> is hazy. He lived a normal childhood and was cared for by his grandfather. The whereabouts of his parents and the events that lead to him being raised by his grandfather are unknown. Of course, as with most mutant children, the normalcy of existence was cut short. When Dallas' mutant powers first emerged, his grandfather had a severe heart-attack, which resulted in his hospitalization. Thankfully, Dallas' guardian would make a speedy recovery from the strain that was put on his heart. It was not long afterward that both were contacted by Xavier Institute.</p><h2>At the Xavier Institute</h2><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14360/290296-96906-specter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-290296\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.8064516129032\" data-width=\"155\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 155px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:180.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14360/290296-96906-specter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-290296\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14360/290296-96906-specter.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14360/290296-96906-specter.jpg 155w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 155px) 100vw, 155px\" data-width=\"155\"></a></figure><p>While at the Institute, Dallas had a rather easy transition from his home life. Thanks to his upbringing, he had a great personality and therefore had no trouble fitting in or making friends. Dallas also showed huge potential, in terms of both mutant power and ability. And unlike many mutants his age, he was very comfortable with the fact that he was a mutant and had powers. Dallas was able to physically merge his body with that of his own shadow, creating one entity which possessed many super-human attributes. He also stated numerous times that his shadow was his best friend. It's assumed that when his mutant powers first manifested, his shadow gained sentience, enabling the two of them to communicate with each other. He looked at his powers and situation as a blessing, not a hindrance, and readily took on his future with a positive attitude.</p><h2>Advisors and Code-Names</h2><p>Due to the large number of students enrolled at the school, it was necessary for the two headmasters, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Scott Summers</a> (Cyclops) and <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a> (once known as the White Queen), to design a special mentoring system in place so that everyone would equally be given the same amount of attention. Each student would be able to select their own advisor. The advisors were all member's of the school's faculty. In most cases they were also current or one time X-Men or allies of. As advisors they would use their experience and wisdom to help the growth of each of their advisees. Each advisor could only have 5-6 students at most, as to not be overwhelmed or spread too thin. Dallas would select Ms. Frost as his advisor.</p><p>Emma took her job very seriously. She explained to all of them that, \"There will always be those that are destined for greatness and it's my job to teach my advisees how to be among those select few.\" It was typical for the faculty to choose codenames for their pupils, but Emma decided that her group was intelligent enough to choose their own. Dallas insisted on the name Specter concerned that, \"Anything with the word shadow would be cliché.\" Emma ended the meeting letting the students know that as her protegés, there was no price too high for her to pay for their success.</p><h2>The Corsairs Training Squad</h2><p>Changing things up in an effort to make teaching more effective, Cyclops would introduce the concept of \"training squads.\" The new teams would have uniforms, team colors, and participate against one another to gain points. This lead to the annual \"Field Day.\" The \"squad system,\" resulted in some students being switched to other advisors. Unfortunately, Specter would be the only one of Emma's students to be reassigned to another squad.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1207533\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.77521008403361\" data-width=\"952\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 952px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1207533\"><img alt=\"The Corsairs\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg 952w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35500/1207533-newxmeniiyearbook_stepford_01.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Corsairs</figcaption></figure><p>Specter's new advisor would be the Headmaster of the Xavier Institute, Cyclops. Though he had to leave his group, Specter would enjoyed finding a permanent squad to be a part of. He, and the other members of his squad were named the Corsairs, named for Cyclops' space pirate father and one time leader of the <a href=\"/starjammers/4060-14871/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14871\">Starjammers</a>. Through Cyclops' incredible leadership skills the Corsairs placed 2nd in the annual competition.</p><h2>M-Day and Stryker Attacks</h2><p>Specter was among the 95% of mutants to lose their powers on M-Day. He awoke and attempted to call for his shadow as usual. When it didn't answer Dallas began to get nervous. After he realized that he wasn't the only one whose powers weren't responding, the reality of the situation hit him. Devastated, he started crying uncontrollably. He kept exclaiming, \"He won't answer me!\"</p><p>There wasn't much time for everyone to get adjusted to the new situation. <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\">William Stryker</a> chose this day to attack, little knowing that the large majority of the students were now completely devoid of the mutant X-gene. The X-Men, whom mostly still had their powers, decided that the depowered mutants should be evacuated from the school since they now had now way to protect themselves. Some were picked up by family or by other means, and the last few were to leave on a bus in the middle of the night. At night, all the depowered students said their goodbyes and got on the bus to start their voyage. Suddenly, a missile was launched and hit the bus dead on, killing all aboard the bus. Stryker later realized that he murdered non-mutant humans instead of eradicating the mutant \"menace.\" Dallas was at first thought to be among those on the bus, but it was later revealed that he was actually picked up by his grandfather. He was alive - depowered but alive, safe with his family.</p><p>It is assumed he is still living with his grandfather and adjusting to normal life.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Specter is an Alpha-Level Mutant.</p><p>Specter formerly possessed the mutant power of Darkness Manipulation. Specifically he had the ability to physically merge his body with his shadow. Fully merged he looked darker in appearance and exhibited many superhuman traits including (but not limited to):</p><p><b>Super Strength:</b> Though untested, Specter exhibited extremely increased levels of strength.</p><p><b>Super Speed:</b> Specter could move at superhuman speeds, far beyond that of the most highly trained athlete.</p><p><b>Heightened Invulnerability:</b> Specter is able to sustain more damage then he would be able to otherwise.</p><p><b>Night Vision:</b> Specter's eyes allow him to see in complete darkness.</p><p><b>Immunity to Darkness-Based Attacks:</b> While merged with his shadow, Specter is a being of darkness. As such he is immune to attacks that are shadow elemental in origin.</p><p><b>Limitations:</b></p><p>His powers work strongest during the day time when most visible. Similar to the solar-mutant <a href=\"/sunspot/4005-4644/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4644\">Sunspot</a>, at night his strength levels are dramatically reduced.</p><p>Additionally, Dallas is only able to merge with his shadow for limited times. Extended lengths of time run the risk of him succumbing to the darkness and becoming evil. As it is while merged he takes on a slightly darker persona that though controllable at first, eventually takes over his personality.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><p><b>Gender:</b> Male.</p><p><b>Height:</b> 5'4\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 110 lbs.</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Blue.</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Blonde.</p><h2>Status</h2><p><b>Known Relatives:</b> Grandfather (name unrevealed).</p><p><b>Citizenship:</b> United States.

Because H.A.T.E. loves him and he love H.A.T.E, for every day of his horrible, drug-extended, terrorist-fighting life.</p><p>Every day, he smokes two hundred cigarettes and one hundred cigars. His dinner is raw meat with drink a bottle of whisky and three bottles of wine. The chef serves him a live animal, and he kills it with his bare hands and eats what he wants. The rest he has buried in New Jersey.</p><p>He also has his mother's old clothing, which he wears and prizes more then anything on this earth.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Dirk Anger is a parody of <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a> created by <a href=\"/warren-ellis/4040-40893/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40893\">Warren Ellis</a> for the sole purpose of Nextwave, as Marvel would not allow Warren to portray Fury as a suicidal, drug-fueled lunatic who wears his mother's dresses.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Head of H.A.T.E.</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33796/757682-one_crazy_mammajamma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-757682\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.91090909090909\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33796/757682-one_crazy_mammajamma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-757682\"><img alt=\"Dirk Anger loves H.A.T.E.\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33796/757682-one_crazy_mammajamma.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33796/757682-one_crazy_mammajamma.jpg 550w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33796/757682-one_crazy_mammajamma.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33796/757682-one_crazy_mammajamma.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Dirk Anger loves H.A.T.E.</figcaption></figure><p>Anger hung himself in an accidentally successful suicide attempt in his room while two female agents listened outside. They didn't help him, because the noises they heard were the same as the ones he made while looking at illegal websites. That didn't stop H.A.T.E. from bringing him back as a depressed zombie, however.</p><p>He promptly crashes the H.A.T.E ship into a base, claiming that suicide is now a group activity.</p><p>Later, Dirk Anger appears (seemingly as his normal self) in World War Hulks.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Dirk Anger is a skilled secret agent who has access to untold resources through his connection with <a href=\"/hate/4060-41651/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41651\">H.A.T.E.</a>, the Beyond Corporation and S.I.L.E.N.T. He is conceivably highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat and marksmanship, though it's a strong possibility that he is incompetent. Anger has a zombie chip that is implanted in his brain. He tried to kill himself and now commands H.A.T.E. as a zombie.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Toys</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5193905-dirk.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5193905-dirk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5193905-dirk.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5193905-dirk.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In 2016, an action-figure of Nick Fury was brought out by HASBRO with a special 'alternate head' of Dirk Anger.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Litterbug was a young man who worked as a mechanic in the Army until his powers manifested soon after joining, giving him a cockroach-like apperance. He joined up with the Chicago branch of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3191\" href=\"/morlocks/4060-3191/\" slug=\"morlocks\">   Morlocks</a> under the leadership of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45620\" href=\"/postman/4005-45620/\" slug=\"postman\">   Postman.</a> Litterbug has a deep understanding of the Sentinels, and he reveals to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45613\" href=\"/angel-dust/4005-45613/\" slug=\"angel-dust\">   Angel Dust</a> that he used to work on them in the Army. He, however, seems to have rejected the American government, tearing up a Buy American cigarette poster, and asking Postman to help him burn off his Army tattoo on his right shoulder.  <br/> <br/><h2>Creation</h2>Litterbug is a Morlock and a <a data-ref-id=\"4010-31\" href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" slug=\"marvel\">Marvel comics</a> character. The Morlocks are underground group of mutants who are disaffected and feel shunned by society. Their name is derived from the H. G. Wells novel The Time Machine, which also features a group of beings who live underground. Litterbug is from the Chicago Morlock community and was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40439\" href=\"/geoff-johns/4040-40439/\" slug=\"geoff-johns\">Geoff Johns,</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5343\" href=\"/shawn-martinbrough/4040-5343/\" slug=\"shawn-martinbrough\">Shawn Martinbrough</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-17795\" href=\"/gregory-wright/4040-17795/\" slug=\"gregory-wright\">Gregory Wright.</a> Litterbug first appears in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-25428\" href=\"/morlocks/4050-25428/\" slug=\"morlocks\">Morlocks #1</a> released in 2002. <br/><br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Litterbug was one of few mutants to retain his powers on <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\" href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" slug=\"m-day\">   M-Day</a>. He possesses a chitinous exoskeleton that protects him from injury and makes him virtually invulnerable against physical attacks, but his mutation makes it hard for him to speak. He also has extremely hard and sharp claws and teeth as well as superhuman strength, speed, agility and stamina. He is a skilled mechanic.",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Zombie Priest is a mysterious elderly man who dresses in a dishoveled suit and top hat. His hat is adorned with the skin of a man's face stitched to the front of it. <a href=\"/buzzard/4005-55268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55268\">Buzzard</a> learns that the Zombie Priest is actually a demonic creature from <a href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">hell</a> and was the same impish figure told of in the legend of Rumplestilskin. After the Queen in the legend confronted him with his true name he was cast back into hell and tortured for decades as punishment for being defeated by a human. He eventually managed to climb back into the mortal realm and is now obsessed with destroying humanity and mocking the essence of life by raising his victims as the living dead. The Zombie Priest also displays dominion over other zarious monstrosities such as ghouls and bog monsters (boglurks).</p><p>The mere whispering of his true name renders the Zombie Priest defenseless and is shown to be able to send him into seizure like fits of retching.</p><p>Since it's first appearance in the Hellboy crossover, the Zombie Priest is rarely depicted without the presence of his faithful cat, which can speak and has a disfigured human face.</p>",

He quickly stuns the hero and flees to continue what he believes to be his mission. The new villain strikes assorted gangs, some belonging to the Spider-Man villain <a href=\"/tombstone/4005-3161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3161\">Tombstone</a>, and this angers the durable enemy. Moon Knight encounters Deadzone again and believes his superior agility will give him the upper hand, but yet again he is defeated.</p><h3>Deadzone vs Tombstone</h3><p>Deadzone then seeks out Tombstone. As the crime boss is in a limousine, Deadzone smashes his whips through the glass and yanks out the driver, revealing it was none other than Moon Knight in disguise. Moon Knight mocks him, informing him he's now wearing insulated armor for the occasion. The two have a violent back and forth, and Deadzone subdues him in the whips. Moon Knight over comes the attack and fires a volley of crescent daggers, all of which plunge into Deadzone and incapacitate him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1268807\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.59266802443992\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1268807\"><img alt=\"Deadzone's violent defeat.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg 982w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Deadzone's violent defeat.\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg 982w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39001/1268807-dzfight11.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Deadzone's violent defeat.</figcaption></figure><p>Tombstone then offers a treaty with Moon Knight and grabs Deadzone by the neck, ready to kill him.

Knowing that his race secret where in danger he fake being insane allowing enough time for him to study the mechanical beings. However this yea no result and eventually Yson was driving mad losing all hope in the process. So as to when Dead Head II show up to assimilate him he was more than fine to be free of his constant torture. <br/> <br/>Years later within a mission to cure the plague Perfection that was turning people into steel Dead Head II was hit with purging program that was making his personalities resurface knowing the danger of it but also knowing the enemies would soon overwhelm them he allowed Yson to take over as he was the only one who fought them before. While Yson did fight them he later ran into a room which allowed him to re-create his body therefore gaining new chance at life.  <br/> <br/>As expect from man driving mad he was now after blood and worse of it all his mechanical-phobia had only increase by his stay inside Dead Head II.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Death's Head II, or Minion, was a creation of <a href=\"/evelyn-necker/4005-47367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47367\">Dr. Evelyn Necker</a>, sent through time and space to absorb the universe's greatest minds, and warriors to further the goals of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M.</a> Minion's next target was to be <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a>, but due to an unexpected attack from <a href=\"/deaths-head/4005-40497/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40497\">Death's Head</a>, Minion instead absorbed the personality of the robotic bounty hunter and rebelled against Dr. Necker, and thus, Death's Head II was born!</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Death's Head II is from Earth-8410. But last resided in Earth-616. He was created by <a href=\"/dan-abnett/4040-41686/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41686\">Dan Abnett</a> and <a href=\"/liam-sharp/4040-2629/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2629\">Liam Sharp,</a> and first appeared in the <a href=\"/deaths-head-ii-the-wild-hunt-part-one-mergers-and-aquisitions/4000-114879/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-114879\">Death's Head II issue #1</a>(1992) mini-series.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Death's Head II</h3><p>After gaining free will, Death's Head II fled through time and space and eventually encountered another of Necker's fugitive creations, the genetically engineered Tuck. The two would inadvertently find themselves entangled in a crucial event in the history of Earth-616, the prevention of <a href=\"/charnel/4005-8035/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8035\">Charnel</a>'s rise to power, and theoretically the prevention of Earth-9939's existence. Death's Head II, Tuck, and some of the Avengers of Earth-9939 fought Charnel, and defeated him, but at a high cost: only Death's Head II, Tuck, and 9939's <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch </a>survived the fight.</p><p>Death's Head II has traveled to various realities including Earth-9939, but was last seen in Earth-616, which he now considers to be his home. On 616, DHII made numerous friends including <a href=\"/dark-angel/4005-7978/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7978\">Dark Angel</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/motormouth/4005-7973/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7973\">Motormouth</a>, <a href=\"/killpower/4005-7979/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7979\">Killpower</a>, and the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>, DHII even joined three teams--Death3, Dark Guard and MI 13.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Minion possesses the accumulative knowledge of over 106 distinct personalities from across time and space of various different warriors which he has downloaded into his program through his Cranial Siphon. The Cranial Siphon kills the individual during the process, Minion rams his metamorphic arm into the individual's skull at the base of the neck. (<a href=\"/deaths-head-ii-1-the-wild-hunt-part-one-mergers-an/4000-114879/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-114879\">Death's Head II Vol. 1, Issue # 1</a>). These personalities Gives Minion the distinct advantage during combat able to draw and use the combat instincts and the intelligence of those he has acquired during battle and on top of his fighting instincts Minion's cybernetic systems automatically adapt and improves it's tactics learning during battle. (<a href=\"/deaths-head-ii-2-x-cuses-the-lotus-fx-part-two/4000-114911/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-114911\">Death's Head II, Vol. 2, issue # 2</a>).</p><p>Due to Minion being from the year 2020 he possesses historical files of various individuals and their abilities as well as their temporal location .</p><p>Death's Head II's adaptive counter measures is capable of hijacking opponent's software given sufficient time for analyzes during battle. It has allowed him to turn off alien weaponry and bypass energy shields using matching frequencies as well as jacking into Four Freedom Plaza and downloading its stored knowledge. Death's Head II right arm is capable of morphing into various configurations from Bladed weapons to energy weapons as well as his Cranial Siphon.</p><p>Minion is capable of full self regeneration able to heal and regenerate injuries to itself during battle if the opponent is capable of damaging his armored form usually requiring adamantium level weaponry. So far Minion has had his arm severed during transitional form by <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> and to Wolverine's amazement the liquid arm reattached itself to the main body while Minion walked toward Logan. Minion's regeneration has allowed it to engage Wolverine in close quarter battle healing the wounds made to it's body almost immediately. His regeneration is so high that it has allowed him to survive having his body nearly cut in half and giant holes shot through its body. when the damage is sufficiently high enough it turns itself into a liquid metal form to repair itself making Minion one of the most dangerous cybernetic organism on the planet. (Death's Head II, Vol, 2. Issue # 1 - 4).</p><p>Minion strength and durability has been sufficient enough to easily overpower and manhandle the Thing as well as engage the Hulk in physical battle.</p><p>Minion's reaction and overall speed is superhuman his cybernetic system adapts to its environment that it is in to reduce collateral damage to its environment only using speeds that can be supported by the pavement and ground at its lowest setting it is able to outrun a speeding vehicle (<a href=\"/deaths-head-ii-2-the-wild-hunt-part-two-reed-richa/4000-114881/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-114881\">Death's Head II, Vol. 1. Issue # 2</a>). Minion can similarly increase or reduce his reaction reflex able to shoot, aim or counter at superhuman levels.</p><p>Minion also possesses Superhuman auditory enhancements helping him track and locate his victims during combat. Minion was designed for combat and to protect the interest of the future A.I.M. organization as such he has been given the tools to do so including a temporal unit allowing him to travel across time and space to have helped it face any threat to A.I.M.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 7'</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 400 lbs</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Blue and Yellow</li></ul><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-811</h3><p>A different version of the Days of the Future Past, where Excalibur never existed and a group R. C. X. (Resistance Coordination Executive) instead for the freedom of the last humans in Earth. This Sentinel command was name the Hierarchy and commanded by Ahab. While fighting the Sentinels Death's Head Minion was fry and his body destroy, which broke the spirit of the heroes of this reality that saw him as unbeatable. After the arrival of Excalibur of Earth-616 and with there help they were able to rewrite the Hierarchy.</p><h3>Earth-8454</h3><p>The events of this Earth happen during <a href=\"/what-if-what-if-deaths-head-i-had-live/4000-111372/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-111372\">“What if Death’s Head had lived?”</a>. In this reality Death’s Head manage to escape the Minion from destroying him by teleporting away. However the Minion continue with his next target Reed Richard and it traveled to the present time, it fought Mister Fantastic and taking a moment of weakness it killed him and assimilated his skills into himself it then returned to 2020 where Baron Strucker the V use his necromancy to trap Minion and become one with him, making this realities Charnel. The Dr. Necker of this reality offer Death’s Head quite the money to fight Charnel, so taking a time belt from A.I.M. he traveled back into the past to recruit several heroes; Luke Cage, Captain America, Human Torch, Invisible Woman, Namor the Sub-Marine, the Thing, War Machine. Charnel easily finish all the heroes while Death’s Head watch. Finally Death’s Head jumped into the battle taking on Charnel in a barbaric way but knowing he wouldn’t win this way he activated a synaptic scrambler momentarily disrupting Charnel, in that moment Reed Richard’s personality took over and he paralyzed Charnel. Taking this moment Death’s Head killed Charnel once in for all.</p>",

She discovered interesting signals from an alternate Earth (Earth-9939) and transported Death Wreck there, where he was promptly attacked by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55754\" href=\"/spawn-of-charnel/4005-55754/\"> spawn of Charnel</a>, who were beings given life through magic consisting of the metal promethium. After a short battle of which Death Wreck was on the losing end of, Dr. Necker retrieved her creation, and unexpectedly, an arm of one of the spawn of Charnel, which she used to create a being deadlier then Death's Head II, Death Metal. But Evelyn's luck was no better with Death Metal then it had been with Minion, and he too wen't rogue. Unwilling to give up, Necker sen't Death Wreck back to Earth-9939, where he befriended the remaining Avengers of that reality, and hoping to gain more allies they used a device to bring more like D.W. to their reality and thus, transported Death's Head II, and Death Metal to their world.

    "description": "<p>A race of ape-like aliens called Gene-Corps started an experiment on the planet Themax-2, in which it would create a race of humanoid warriors, implanting them with false memories of ruling a kingdom called Elysium. They also had the instinctive need to attack and kill any other member of their race they encountered.  This was so they could determine most powerful, and that final victor would be the true Bloodseed. <br/><br/>While traveling through a snowy landscape searching for his non-existant kingdom and Queen Ellissya, Bloodseed began to succumb to the freezing temperatures.  He was rescued by two apelike creatures, who took took him underground to Nepenthe.  Nepenthe, the last of her race, immediately fell in love with Bloodseed, and revealed to him what she knew about  the Masters, showing him some of the machinery they left behind.  Warning him of an impending Ice Age, Nepenthe begged him to stay with her.  Knowing of her powers, Bloodseed asked her to look into his future, but she fled in terror upon seeing it.  Bloodseed caught up with her, and offered to stay with her.  Nepenthe, realizing Bloodseed had a greater destiny than being by her side, used her powers to erase his memories of her, and returned him to the surface world, to continue his quest.  After she left, Bloodseed awoke and, not remembering the encounter, went on his way through the snowy wasteland.<br/><br/>As he continued his journey, Bloodseed recalled false memories of his kingdom, where he ruled.  In the middle of the icy plain, he was attacked by a group of demonic ape-creatures, but after the huge fight he awoke with no injuries.  He entered a cave and found a massive amount of weapons and machinery, including a giant monkey-wrench, which he liked.  While exploring the odd catacombs, he encountered a beautiful young woman. Due to a strange thought that overpowered his mind of someone in danger, Bloodseed realized the woman was an illusion, and that he was actually standing before a giant monster, which quickly dived back into the darkness.  Rushing to the outside of the cave to find the creature that invaded his mind, Bloodseed fought off a group of blue-skinned demonic creatures that were trying to kill an enormous birdlike creature. With the demons killed, the creature told Bloodseed Bloodseed that he had the ability to heal others, and asked that he use that power to heal it.  Once healed, the creature explained he was a member of a race called the Ptero-People, and was headed south to escape the oncoming winter and invited Bloodseed to join him.  Though Bloodseed declined, his new friend told him all he knew of Bloodseed and his kind, including the fact that they were part of some sort of test devised by the Masters.  Giving Bloodseed a helmet of truth, the creature entered his race's cave, and it closed behind him. <br/><br/>Bloodseed soon came upon another base of the Masters, this one called Automatic Way-Station 12B.  There, a hologram image of one of the  Gene-Corps members appeared, and showed Bloodseed a program detailing Gene-Corps' creation of his race on Themax-2, as well as a race of elfish humanoids on another planet named Antar-19.  Not understanding what he was witnessing, and not realizing that Gene-Corps was the same as the Masters, Bloodseed grew impatient, demanding the hologram show him something he could understand.  It brought up an image of Ellissya, but after it created several more images of her, Bloodseed destroyed some machinery and left.  Arriving at a large tower, he was attacked by a group of demonic creatures serving another member of Bloodseed's race.  Before they could  harm him, a waterbeast emerged from a well and attacked him.<br/><br/>Realizing that the waterbeast was attacking him due to being in pain, Bloodseed used his healing powers on it, and it released him.  Returning to the surface, he was almost immediately captured by some of Brother Bloodseed's demonic mutants.  As his brother taunted him with death, Lysander used his powers to call out to the waterbeast, and it emerged in the middle of his brother's laboratory, killing him.  Still attached to machines, Bloodseed then found himself face-to-face with the true Ellissya, who helped him escape.  Soon after, they encountered the Great One, a member of Gene-Corps who claimed to be fighting against them, but was in reality instructed by the Chief Engineer to lie to them in order to get them to fight each other.  The Great One told them that they were originally normal people with individual lives, and had been reprogrammed by the Masters.  He convinced them both that he could undo the programming, but Bloodseed would have to remove his helmet.  When he did Ellissya's instinctive bloodlust kicked in, and she attacked her kin.  As the two fought, the Chief Engineer contacted the sentient dinosaur Lord Juro, and told him that the plan was nearing a finale, asking where he wanted the last Bloodseed transported to.  Lord Juro replied that he intended to return to his home planet, Earth.<br/></p>",

Tom possesses mutant abilities which enable him to communicate with machines.  Tom reprogrammed the Sentinel and named him <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41732\" href=\"/rover/4005-41732/\" slug=\"rover\">  Rover</a>.  As a child Rover would find food for Tom, and provide protection.</p><p>As Tom grew older Rover remained his loyal companion, protecting Tom from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11330\" href=\"/sublime/4005-11330/\" slug=\"sublime\">  Sublime</a>'s  <a data-ref-id=\"4015-51112\" href=\"/crawler/4015-51112/\" slug=\"crawler\">  Crawler</a>.

E.V.A. brought them back to the X-Men's compound, not knowing that one of the Crawlers had hidden inside Rover's chest cavity.  Back at the X-Men's headquarters the Crawler teleported out and began spawning duplicates of itself.  Before the X-Men were able to take them down a group were able to teleport the phoenix egg off of Rover's back and back to Sublime's layer.</p><p>Later when the X-Men were saving <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50510\" href=\"/mer-max/4005-50510/\" slug=\"mer-max\">  Mer-Max</a> from a boat full of Crawlers Tom began to confess his feelings for E.V.A.  While talking to E.V.A. Tom failed to notice the pack of Crawlers that were teleporting around Rover, attacking him.  Rover fell and sank into the ocean, leaving Tom distraught.  Soon after Sublime arrived, and Tom called Rover telepathically to save them.  Rover attacked Sublime and was presumably destroyed in the process.  E.V.A. attacked sublime as well and was seriously damaged in the process.  Tom came to E.V.A.'s side to comfort her as Phoenix fixed the corrupted time-line that they belonged to.</p><p>It was hinted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41121\" href=\"/martha-johansson/4005-41121/\" slug=\"martha-johansson\">  Martha Johansson</a> that Phoenix may have taken their souls to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-50483\" href=\"/white-hot-room/4020-50483/\" slug=\"white-hot-room\">  White Hot Room</a>.</p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Powers</h2><p>Tom possesses an innate ability to communicate with machines.

He took the codename his grandfather had out of respect. (Beak must have done something spectacular because Tito thinks he was a great hero). Unlike his grandfather, Tito is a musclebound and very capable fighter. He looks less like a chicken and more like an eagle. In <a data-ref-id=\"4045-41708\" href=\"/here-comes-tomorrow/4045-41708/\">Here Comes Tomorrow</a>, Tito stood alongside <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\">Wolverine</a> and the rest of the X-Men against Sublime and his <a data-ref-id=\"4015-51112\" href=\"/crawler/4015-51112/\">Crawlers</a>. He died, but before he did, he got to do the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41709\" href=\"/fastball-special/4015-41709/\">Fastball Special</a> with Wolverine, something he had been waiting his whole life for.</p>",

    "description": "<p>History</p><p>Ariel is the daughter of Alan Fagan (the fourth <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23692\" href=\"/mr-fear/4005-23692/\" slug=\"mr-fear\">Mr. Fear</a>). Fagan used her mother, Cora Tremmore, for carnal pleasure and left, refusing to help care or take any responsibility for Ariel. As a result, Cora taught Ariel to hate her father and to strive to be better than him. After Cora was the victim of a horrific workplace accident, Ariel dedicated herself to her goal of being better than her father. As it proved to be an expensive undertaking, Ariel utilized a variety of ways of earning money, including theft and prostitution.</p><p>Eventually, Ariel paid a group of inmates to attack her imprisoned father and slash off a piece of his face. After receiving the skin sample, Ariel brought it to a chemist to examine it as well as produce a new, improved fear chemical. Ariel used this to transform herself in Shock, Mistress of Fear.</p><p>Using her newfound powers, Shock terrorized the population of New York and attracted the attention of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\" href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" slug=\"daredevil\">Daredevil</a>, who used his keen senses to track the scent of the chemical to Ariel. Transforming into Shock, she used her abilities to cause Daredevil to become enraged and then tackled him off the top of the building they were on. Both made it safely to the ground, but Shock escaped by using her powers to cause panic in the streets.</p><p>Shock then visited her father in the hospital. He was dying, but Shock tormented him until his vital signs began to strengthen. Daredevil tracked her down again and this time she caused him to hallucinate that he was being attacked by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\" href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" slug=\"elektra\">Elektra</a>. Daredevil managed to keep clear headed enough to force Shock to consume another dose of her chemical, transforming her back to her human form. This made it far easier to arrest her, but while she was handcuffed, Ariel's hands turned back to their taloned form and she readied herself to break free.</p><p>Powers</p><p>By consuming the chemical synthesized by her father's skin Ariel transforms to a monstrous form with razor sharp talons. Shock can generate terror, rage and even hatred in others. Unlike her predecessors, she is capable of generating more than primal fear - she can also cause her victims to hallucinate their greatest fears.</p><p>She did not appear to be able to generate her emotion manipulating pheromones in her human form. However, the ending of her last appearance suggests that she may be able to transform to and from her monstrous form at will, rather than being reliant upon chemicals.</p>",

    "deck": "Spider-Man's \"Other\" who came into being after his rebirth. She masqueraded as the school nurse at Peter Parker's old high school, and would later try to consume Kaine after sleeping with him in Houston.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>After <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man </a>cheated death, Spiders ate Peter's old body. The spiders, along with Peter's skin, created a new body. This new body looked female. It told Spidey that she exists because he was supposed to die, so she was sent to kill him. Before much of a battle it escaped from Spider-Man and into the sewer.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>As Miss Arrow</h3><p>Between the events of <a href=\"/spider-man-the-other/4045-43776/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43776\"> Spider-Man: The Other</a> and <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"> Civil War</a>, the high school Parker worked at got a new nurse named 'Miss Arrow'. She met <a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\"> Flash Thompson</a> when he was injured by Peter Parker. Flash took a liking to her and started to flirt with her. Later that day, the school was attacked by Francis Klum as <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\"> Mysterio</a>. The second Mysterio (Daniel Berkhart), came to stop Klum. When Arrow got separated from the group, she met up with, the once dead, Quentin Beck. He told her that he knew she was pretending to be an innocent bystander. Beck told her that she must make Peter continue to work at the school. Beck disappeared and Arrow found herself with another Mysterio, Klum. Klum was going to hold her hostage and he told her that she was going to be a pawn in his game. She extended the large stingers that were hidden in her wrists and she plunged one in Klum's chest. Before she could finish Klum off, he vanished. After the school was safe, she managed to convince Peter to continue working at the school. After that, Peter betrayed Iron Man and had Beast make a holographic disguise.</p><h3>Ero</h3><p>Miss Arrow revealed herself to be composed of spiders when she talked to a spider deity in a Church. She told it that she found a host(Flash Thomson), and that he will be her mate, and sustenance. She also says that she must reproduce to survive. Meanwhile, Betty Brant discovered who Peter was, despite his holographic disguise. The two talked about their concern for Arrow, and that she seem suspicious. Earlier, when Flash and Peter were talking and Peter did not have his disguise on, Miss Arrow walked into the room. Pete just barely managed to turn on his disguise. Peter found it strange that his spider-sense did not warn him of her approach. Betty and Peter search \"Arrow\" and \"Spider\" on the internet, but nothing relevant comes up. The search engine says \"Do you mean 'Ero'?\". Peter tells Betty that Ero is a genus of spider that sounds like 'Arrow'. This reminds Pete of the Pirate Spiders that were in humanoid form back when he came back to life. Meanwhile Flash is bowling with friend Kelly Kulick and the Midtown High bowling team. Miss Arrow finds him and tells him that they should leave immediately for a date. He says that he can't because he can't leave the students. Arrow violently shoves Kulick and grabs Flash, Flash is surprised that she has a strong grip. When Flash starts telling his displeasure, Arrow grabs him by the throat. Just then, Kulick attacks Arrow from behind only to get swarmed by spiders. Spider-Man comes and attacks Miss Arrow, the two talk a bit and Miss Arrow escapes by transforming into a bunch of spiders and slipping away into a gutter. She comes back under the truck that Flash and Kulick are hiding in, propelling the truck up into the air. Spidey tells her to let Kulick go. Ero complies by letting her fall to the ground. Spider-Man saves her and goes to the truck. The truck is now on the ground, but Ero escaped into the sewer with Thomson.</p><h3>Final Moments</h3><p>Ero takes Flash to the church where she was talking to the spider. She removes an egg sac from her stomach and tells Flash that the reason he makes a good mate is that he was in a coma for many months and it made him build up a tremendous amount of tantric energy. This tantric energy will make it so she will have much more offspring. She plans the egg sac down Flash's throat, which will cause Flash to give birth, killing him in the process. Spider-Man eventually tracked Ero down to the church and he took the egg sac from her and he stuck it to a near-by wall. Ero leaps at him with her stingers and so does Spider-Man. As they fought Ero revealed that Spidey's stingers only come when he fights someone \"Whose being is rooted in primal forces of chaos and darkness\". Ero stabs Spidey, poisoning him. She takes the egg sac and plans to shove it down Spidey's throat. Even though it will mean less offspring, she will not have to deal with Spider-Man ever again. Right before Spider-Man is impregnated, the egg sac is shot by Betty Brant. Ero is enraged and vows revenge. Spider-Man uses this moment to lure Ero into an aviary. The birds swarm over her and she is eaten. Only one piece is left behind and Spider-Man smashes it.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Ero's body is made up of nothing but spiders she has the ability to transform into a stream of spiders and she has the ability to control massive numbers of spiders.Her body is pretty much invulnerable as most attacks tend to go right through her and any attacks only seem to damage the spiders that make up her body, but she seems to feel no pain and can easily put herself back together with her spiders or summon new ones she can simply be defend as a energy being simply controling spiders. She can also release blasts of extra spiders from her mouth. Ero can also atler the shape and color of her body to look like a human, not only as Mis Arrow but also as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annabelle-adams/4005-83080/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83080\">Annabelle Adams</a>, Kaine's ex-girlfriend. Ero has great strength,speed and agility, she seems to be on the same level as Spider-man, but she made statements claiming to be stronger, but these where more than likely simply meant to unnerve Peter. She was able to produce webbing from her figure tips forming webs and a parachute for gliding on wind currents like baby Spiders. Much like Spider-Man, she has stingers that come from her writs. Her stingers were also venomous like his. She said that they would kill a normal human but only slowed Spider-man down. She is also able to hide herself from Spider-man's spider-sense. Due to her body being composed of pirate spiders she naturaly has to feed on other spiders and can consume humans as well. However she only has a short life span and her life can only be sustained by reproducing. Her children gestate in an egg sac and will eat there way out of there egg an their host, but preserve their hosts spirit in them. However they require \"tantric energy\" to be born, which she she described as a type of divine power people release during sex. The less sex an person has the more the more children that can be produced. She has a great weakness towards holy objects as she was weakened by silver bullets with crosses in them and found strength in an abandoned church and she can die if all the spiders that make up her body are destroyed or consumed before she can absorb new ones.</p>",

Her father has been missing for some time and it is unknown if he abandoned them. She encountered <a href=\"/drax-the-destroyer/4005-6807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6807\">Drax the Destroyer</a> when a prison ship he was on board crash landed on Earth just outside of her town. She drags a boy from school along with her to try and find it and encounters surviving prisoners <a href=\"/paibok-the-power-skrull/4005-11524/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11524\">Paibok</a>, <a href=\"/lunatik/4005-41513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41513\">Lunatik</a>, and the <a href=\"/blood-brothers/4005-15023/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15023\">Blood Brothers</a>. The boy she is with runs away, but she isn't moved at all by the sudden appearance of aliens. The group of escapees make for her town to enslave them in hopes that they can reconstruct a ship from the debris and leave Earth quietly. Drax is intellectually impaired at this time and Cammi, for no other reason than being bored, easily tricks him into thinking she is his daughter. She tells him that the Blood Brothers hurt her and Drax goes into a rage seeking vengeance on those that hurt his daughter. The fight spills into town where the combined efforts of the prisoners kill Drax.</p><p>Cammi then claims Drax's body because it is something special that isn't seen everyday. The body starts to smoke and then transforms into a new, smarter Drax. Because of this, Cammi believes that she is the current owner of Drax. Drax looks into her memories to remember what is going on and easily can tell that she is not his daughter. Drax again fights the prisoners culminating in the death of Lunatik and one of the Blood Brothers. Fearing for his safety, Paibok uses a beacon to call on his captors for their recapture. Having no more reason to fight, Drax waits with him for the ship to arrive. Cammi's mother did not survive the alien occupation of Coot's Bluff. She follows Drax onto the new prison ship and to the planet <a href=\"/xandar/4020-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56106\">Xandar</a>, home of the <a href=\"/nova-corps/4060-40482/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40482\">Nova Corps</a>, in hopes that she can find something that will make her happy.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Annihilation</h3><p>After arriving on Xandar, Cammi and Drax are both released from custody on the technicality that Drax's DNA does not match that on record. This is due to his recent transformation. Soon after, the Xanadar cluster is attacked by the <a href=\"/annihilation-wave/4060-55905/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55905\">Annihilation Wave</a>. Cammi and Drax miraculously survive the attack in a small escape ship that crashes back on the planet. There they encounter the only other survivor and last living member of the Nova Corps, <a href=\"/nova/4005-2105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2105\">Nova</a>. With his help, they find a ship and leave the planet as it is falling from its orbit.</p><p>Cammi sticks with Drax for most of the Annihilation War who remains with Nova and the <a href=\"/united-front/4060-44895/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44895\">United Front</a>. She realizes Drax is only sticking with them in hopes that it will bring him closer to <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a>, who Drax was created to kill. While escaping from a planet under attack by the Annihilation Wave, Drax chooses to stay behind and buy time for the ship Cammi is escaping on despite her protests. After the break up of the United Front, Cammi is left with <a href=\"/gamora/4005-6806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6806\">Gamora</a> after Nova and a small team leave in hopes of killing <a href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annihilus</a>, leader of the Annihilation Wave.</p><p>After the war is over, it is uncertain of what happened to Cammi. Gamora says she got her to safety, but her current location is unknown. She is seen wandering an alien planet with the chaos mite, <a href=\"/skreet/4005-42605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42605\">Skreet</a>, on her shoulder. Drax has since unsuccessfully searched for her.</p><h3>Avengers Arena</h3><p>Cammi is one of the many young superhumans abducted by <a href=\"/arcade/4005-8429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8429\">Arcade</a> for his game of life-or-death on his island arena, having been taken right out from under <a href=\"/sword/4060-41666/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41666\">S.W.O.R.D.</a>'s noses.</p><p>At the time, she was being interrogated by <a href=\"/abigail-brand/4005-4441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4441\">Abigail Brand</a> in their <a href=\"/peak/4020-56604/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56604\">Peak</a> Station headquarters, after having been apprehended by her organization for violating Earth's treaty with the <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\">Shi'ar</a> Empire by attacking a Shi'ar War Hawk ship and siphoning power from their fuel cells. Her accomplices cut and ran when it looked as though they would be caught and killed by the Shi'ar, leaving her stranded and at their mercy. Thankfully, she was apprehended by S.W.O.R.D. instead. However, she did not go down without a fight, shattering the forearm of one of Abigail's best field agents, and nearly killing the rookie that somehow managed to subdue her.</p><p>According to Agent Brand, she had hours of footage similar to this encounter that spread over the previous eighteen months, documenting an impressive intergalactic criminal record she had managed to gain in the aftermath of the <a href=\"/annihilation/4045-41287/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41287\">Annihilation</a> War. Also, according to the DNA samples that S.W.O.R.D. took from her upon her capture, Cammi possesses no unique superhuman abilities, mutations, enhancements, etc. She was offered a full pardon on earth, Agent Brand citing how it would be \" fairly easy to <em>\"lose\"</em> a 13-year-old human girl planet-side\" so long as she assured her that she wouldn't be a threat. However, Cammi stated that she would prefer to extradited to one of the star systems she was wanted in, as opposed to being sent back home to Coot's Bluff. However, before stating her reasons, she was abducted by Arcade.</p><p>Once his challenge on the island had begun, Cammi wasted no time ensuring that she would survive his sick game. She stuck to the forests, kept out of sight of the other groups on the island, slept in the trees, laid traps armed with landmines of extraterrestrial origin, and travelled by night. She was one of the first to notice that, four nights in, someone was hunting them. She met up with <a href=\"/darkhawk/4005-2111/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2111\">Darkhawk</a> and formed a mutual alliance with the former <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warrior</a>. He wanted to make sure that everyone who was life alive made it out of Arcade's clutches in one piece, and she wanted to make it out alive.</p><p>The two split up to cover more ground and figure out who it was that was trailing them. However, before she could make it much further, Cammi was ambushed by <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a>, who mistook her for the mystery assailant. She got the drop on her by burying herself in the snow, then sprang upon her, batted away her blaster, and nearly killed her before realizing her scent wasn't that of their attacker. Admitting her mistake, X-23 apologized to Cammi and disappeared into the night. Still, this encounter left its mark on Cammi, causing her to become incredibly angry with herself. She fired into the air in blind fury, creating a massive explosion. After this demonstration of frustration, Cammi discarded her armor and began training to vent her anger. In the bitter cold, snow falling around her, sweat pouring from her body, Cammi began doing pushups, repeating a self-depreciating mantra to herself aloud, whilst being watched from the shadows by <a href=\"/apex/4005-86741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86741\">Apex</a> and <a href=\"/death-locket/4005-85857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85857\">Death Locket</a>.</p><p>\"Stupid. Weak. Slow. Stupid. Weak. Slow. Stupid. Weak. Slow.\"</p><p>She has also formed a tentative alliance with <a href=\"/runaways/4060-40440/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40440\">Runaways</a> members <a href=\"/nico-minoru/4005-1940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1940\">Nico Minoru</a> and <a href=\"/chase-stein/4005-1938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1938\">Chase Stein</a> after they save her during an avalanche in the snow quadrant. She offers to help them with the basic survival of <a href=\"/murderworld/4020-41963/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41963\">Murderworld</a> in exchange for additional firepower. The trio arrive first at Arcade's food cache, but don't claim it. They watch as <a href=\"/nara/4005-86742/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86742\">Nara</a> and Katy of <a href=\"/braddock-academy/4060-59618/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59618\">Braddock Academy</a> fight over Katy's double-cross and the subsequent beheading of <a href=\"/kid-briton/4005-86714/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86714\">Kid Briton</a> by <a href=\"/anachronism/4005-86739/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86739\">Anachronism</a>. The two groups then form a tentative alliance as Katy and Death Locket flee into the snow. The duo late return, albeit with Katy's twin brother Tim in control of their shared body, being chased by <a href=\"/juston-seyfert/4005-41669/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41669\">Juston Seyfert</a> in the remains of his <a href=\"/sentinel-mark-iv/4005-81817/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81817\">Sentinel Mark IV</a> accompanied by Laura. Nico tries to stop Juston from killing the two, but is attacked by him, resulting in Chase revealing that he now has possession of the <a href=\"/darkhawk-amulet/4055-56481/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56481\">Darkhawk Amulet</a>. Tim then uses his technopathic powers to stop everyone from fighting.</p><p>Later on, Tim reveals his and Katy's history and how their powers work, prompting the others to vote about whether or not they should kill them before Katy comes back. Cammi is one of the five that votes to spare him, believing that even thought it would be tactically smart it would make them just like Katy. When Katy escapes, killing Juston and taking his Sentinel and Rebecca, Cammi pushes Nico to decide what to do, as she is the only person who can stand against Apex in a fight. Unfortunately Katy attacks before they can do anything, leading to a frantic chase through the snow. Nico teleports everyone else out, but is unable to join them. Cammi, Aiden, Nara, X-23 and <a href=\"/bloodstone/4005-86740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86740\">Bloodstone</a> wind up on an island with <a href=\"/hazmat/4005-69914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69914\">Hazmat</a> and <a href=\"/reptil/4005-60768/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60768\">Reptil</a>, and all agree to an alliance. The group sets out to return to the mainland and help Nico defeat Katy.</p><p>However, once they arrive Arcade separates the group quickly, leaving Cammi with the remaining Braddock students. Cullen, overcome by how pointless it is, seeing as it's day 29 of 30, picks a fight with both Cammi and Aiden. Cammi then gets him to reveal some of his backstory, but are interrupted by Arcade unleashing a cloud of <a href=\"/trigger-scent/4055-56712/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56712\">Trigger Scent</a> which causes Laura to go into a frenzy and attack everyone. Cullen removes his <a href=\"/bloodstone-ring/4055-57820/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57820\">Bloodstone Ring</a> and unleashes the parasitic Glartrox to combat Laura, but is unable to control himself. Cammi finds the ring first, but loses it in the nearby water, prompting Nara to search for it while she and the others distract the Glartrox. Nara is successful in finding the ring and transforming Cullen back, but is killed in the process, driving Aiden into a murderous rage and attacking Cullen. Cammi blasts him off, but the situation dissolves quickly. Nico flies off with Cullen trying to kill him, Reptil and Aiden are fighting in the woods, and Hazmat and Laura are somewhere in the woods, leaving Cammi and Chase with the Darkhawk armor alone on the beach.</p><p>Cammi tries to convince Chase to stop Nico, but this results only in her gun being broken by him when she points it at him. When Chase powers down to apologize, Cammi breaks his arm and leg before cutting the amulet out of his chest with two glowing crystal knives. She takes the amulet and charges Nico, stopping her from killing Cullen, but this only leads to Nico believing she had killed Chase and the two fighting. Luckily, Hazmat made it to the beach with her powers going critical. The impending explosion stops the fighting and the group is saved by Reptil, who pulls Jenny into the water. Katy meanwhile, now in control of Murderworld, unleashes all of Arcade's traps on the survivors at once, causing them to ally. Cammi tosses the amulet back to Chase, before attacking a sentient typhoon with her daggers.</p><p>Death Locket, also not dead as previously though, kills Apex at great personal cost and ends the games. Cammi then tells the group of survivors that they need to get their stories straight before they leave. Hazmat reappears from the water and the group all agrees to a pact of silence. Cammi was last seen talking to Abigail Brand, wrapped in a blanket. Unbeknownst to them, Arcade filmed the events and released the footage online, thereby nullifying the pact.</p><h3>Avengers Undercover</h3><p>Three months after the events of Murderworld, Cammi found her mother, though dead, and the two are now living in Anchorage, Alaska. Cammi is seen attending AA meetings with her mother, who went sober once she saw that her daughter was alive when the Murderworld footage went live. After the meeting, Cammi says goodbye to her mother and flies to one of <a href=\"/ulysses-bloodstone/4005-10960/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10960\">Ulysses Bloodstone</a>'s manors. <a href=\"/anachronism/4005-86739/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86739\">Anachronism</a> has called many of the survivors because <a href=\"/bloodstone/4005-86740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86740\">Bloodstone</a> has disappeared and hasn't been heard from in three weeks. He was last seen throwing himself into <a href=\"/bagalia/4020-57907/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57907\">Bagalia</a>, home of <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\">Baron Helmut Zemo</a>'s <a href=\"/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\">Masters of Evil</a>, because that was were he believed Arcade to be. Cammi, Aiden, <a href=\"/chase-stein/4005-1938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1938\">Chase Stein</a>, <a href=\"/nico-minoru/4005-1940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1940\">Nico Minoru</a>, <a href=\"/hazmat/4005-69914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69914\">Hazmat</a>, and <a href=\"/death-locket/4005-85857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85857\">Death Locket</a> all agree to go to Bagalia and infiltrate the Masters of Evil in order to find and rescue Cullen.</p><p>However, upon entering the city, the group is attacked by numerous teen villains including <a href=\"/black-knight/4005-79532/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79532\">Black Knight</a>, <a href=\"/coat-of-arms/4005-62020/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62020\">Coat of Arms</a>, <a href=\"/egghead/4005-62018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62018\">Egghead</a>, <a href=\"/excavator/4005-2255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2255\">Excavator</a>, <a href=\"/executioner-dubois/4005-62022/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62022\">Executioner (DuBois)</a>, <a href=\"/mako/4005-79533/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79533\">Mako</a>, <a href=\"/melter/4005-62023/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62023\">Melter</a>, <a href=\"/mudbug/4005-86425/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86425\">Mudbug</a>, and <a href=\"/snot/4005-90468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90468\">Snot</a>. After the fight ends, Cammi leads the group to Arcade's bar <a href=\"/the-hole/4020-58361/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58361\">The Hole</a>, where she believes Cullen is being kept. However, when it is revealed that his being there is voluntary, the group proceeds to mingle with the bar's numerous villainous patrons.</p><p>Four hours later, Cammi pulls everyone out of the bar and tells them they're leaving, at which point Cullen appears. He is joined by senior Masters of Evil members <a href=\"/hellstorm/4005-14695/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14695\">Hellstorm</a>, <a href=\"/madame-masque/4005-13940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13940\">Madame Masque</a>, and <a href=\"/constrictor/4005-2127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2127\">Constrictor</a>. When Cammi threatens Cullen if he's about to betray them Constrictor and Madame Masque argue over who gets her. Cullen says he wants to show them something, at which point Daimon teleports the group away. When they reappear they are at a black-tie party for an undisclosed person. As the hostess of the party finishes her toast, Arcade teleports in and Cullen reveals that they are there to get revenge on him for Murderworld.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>According to DNA samples taken from Cammi by S.W.O.R.D. upon her capture following an assault on a Shi'ar War Hawk, Cammi possesses no superhuman abilities. She is not a mutant, cyborg, mutate, mystic mutate, alien, hybrid, or a clone. Her genes aren't radioactive, she hasn't been possessed, supercharged, or artificially enhanced in any way, shape, or form. In short, Cammi is an average, 13-year-old human girl. However, there are many things about her that cannot be explained.</p><p>Cammi possesses an uncanny aptitude for hand-to-hand combat, besting highly trained S.W.O.R.D. operatives with impressive skill and strength, enough to shatter bone, all while under the rigors of zero-gravity. She also possesses great agility, able to perform a handstand in zero-gravity, climb trees with ease, and fall from a significant height without sustaining any visible injury. She also possesses keen survival instincts, most likely gleaned from both life in the Alaskan wilderness, and during her tenure under Drax the Destroyer. She knows how to set traps, make tactical observations and formulate strategies on the fly, hunt and track prey or opponents, use the environment to her advantage, manipulate others for her benefit, make split-decision judgement calls, and avoid detection in a wilderness environment. She has also managed to comprehend advanced alien piloting and spacecraft controls, simply from having played video-games for most of her childhood.</p><p>Aside from her skills in combat, Cammi makes use of a wide variety of alien technology, most of which she has managed to acquire over the 18 months she spent in space following the end of the Annihilation war. Chief among them are her spacesuit, jetpack, plasma pistol, and anti-personnel mines. Her spacesuit not only protects her from environmental extremes, but also holds a variety of extraneous functions, such as thermal scanners and infrared vision. She uses a number of anti-personnel mines, ranging from simple pressure-activated ones, to advanced voice-activated mines. The command code to deactivate the latter is \"Waldorf.\"</p><p>She also has, what Abigail Brand refers to as \"one Hell of a poker face,\" which suggests she may have developed a resilience to certain forms of torture, physical and possibly psychological as well. However, this has yet to be expanded upon.</p><p><b>Physical Characteristics</b></p><ul><li>Height: 4' 7\"</li><li>Weight: 80 lbs</li><li>Eyes: Brown</li><li>Hair: Brown</li><li>Unusual Features: Extraterrestrial tribal tattoos on her shoulders and biceps.</li></ul><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Games</h3><h4>Marvel: War of Heroes</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4592680-spacebratcammi4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4592680\" data-ratio=\"1.252380952381\" data-width=\"210\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4592680-spacebratcammi4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4592680\"><img alt=\"Marvel: War of Heroes\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4592680-spacebratcammi4.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4592680-spacebratcammi4.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\"></a><figcaption>Marvel: War of Heroes</figcaption></figure><p>Dust appears in several cards in the mobile card game Marvel: War of Heroes.

He debuted as a direct enemy of the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a>, but his presence continued to grow as the event continued until it ended with him as one of the major players in the reshaped cosmic hierarchy.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Annihilation</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/90624-13735-ravenous.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-90624\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6525\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/90624-13735-ravenous.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-90624\"><img alt=\"Leader of the Seekers\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/90624-13735-ravenous.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/90624-13735-ravenous.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Leader of the Seekers</figcaption></figure><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/annihilation/4045-41287/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41287\">Annihilation</a></p><p>Hailing from the <a href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\">Negative Zone</a>, Ravenous made his presence known to the positive universe when the <a href=\"/annihilation-wave/4060-55905/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55905\">Annihilation Wave</a> began its invasion. He was the leader of the Seekers, being like him who had been bonded by umbilical cords to dog-like beasts. These Currs, as the beasts were called, connected Ravenous and his fellow Seekers to the Opposing Force, an equivalent to the <a href=\"/power-cosmic/4015-41039/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41039\">Power Cosmic</a> in the Negative Zone. While the Annihilation Wave laid waste to <a href=\"/xandar/4020-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56106\">Xandar</a> and rampaged through the Skrull Empire, Ravenous and his Seekers were assigned the special task of capturing the <a href=\"/heralds-of-galactus/4060-40462/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40462\">Heralds of Galactus</a> so that his lord <a href=\"/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annihilus</a> could have them studied for their connections to the Power Cosmic. <a href=\"/air-walker/4005-7126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7126\">Gabriel the Air-Walker</a> was the first found by Ravenous and the Seekers, and his injures became so severe that they exposed he was a machine rather than an organic being. Ravenous was disappointed, because his mission was to bring back living beings possessing the Power Cosmic. As he was about to have Air-Walker destroyed, the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> intervened and managed to escape with his fellow herald. However, the damaged done by Ravenous was too severe, and Air-Walker soon died anyway.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218947-ravenous13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1218947\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.48166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218947-ravenous13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1218947\"><img alt=\"Against His Prey\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1218947-ravenous13.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218947-ravenous13.jpg 600w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1218947-ravenous13.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Against His Prey</figcaption></figure><p>Ravenous was a high ranking member of Annihilus' forces, and as such, he took time away from overseeing the hunt for the heralds to personally escort <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> to a meeting with Annihilus. Meanwhile, his Seekers successfully captured <a href=\"/terrax/4005-2106/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2106\">Terrax the Tamer</a>. Ravenous later learned the location of <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> from tracking the Silver Surfer and dared to confront the Devourer with a fleet of vessels from the Annihilation Wave. He arrived just as the Silver Surfer was being reforced as Galactus' herald once more, and his fleet was overwhelmed by the Surfer's newfound and ruthless determination. Ravenous survived his fleet's destruction, declaring in a challenge that he was still the Surfer's equal. This proved not to be the case any longer. The Surfer soundly defeated Ravenous but allowed him to live to learn the lesson that Galactus' will cannot be opposed.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218910-ravenous07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1218910\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.505\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218910-ravenous07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1218910\"><img alt=\"Defeated by Ronan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218910-ravenous07.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218910-ravenous07.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Defeated by Ronan\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218910-ravenous07.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218910-ravenous07.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Defeated by Ronan</figcaption></figure><p>After Thanos succeeded in acquiring Galactus and the Silver Surfer for Annihilus, Ravenous was given a more direct role in the war. He led the assault on the last stronghold of the <a href=\"/united-front/4060-44895/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44895\">United Front</a>, personally facing off against <a href=\"/ronan/4005-4818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4818\">Ronan the Accuser</a> and <a href=\"/firelord/4005-7108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7108\">Firelord</a>. His forces won the day, and he was teleported to safety as the Annihilation Wave's new Galactus weapon destroyed the planet. The United Front crumbled after this defeat, and Ravenous focused on the <a href=\"/kree/4060-7588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\">Kree Empire</a> to conquer for his lord Annihilus next. The ruling part of the Kree, House Fiyero, reached out to him to negotiated terms of surrender rather than fight him. As he met with them, the trio of Ronan the Accuser, the <a href=\"/super-skrull/4005-21332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21332\">Super Skrull</a> and <a href=\"/praxagora/4005-42334/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42334\">Praxagora</a> fought their way through <a href=\"/hala/4020-56002/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56002\">Hala</a> to confront House Fiyero. Ravenous had little concern over whether Ronan killed them or not. The fact that they were so willing to sell out their people to him hardly convinced him of their loyalty. Still, he fought when Ronan broke through their final defenses. The two clashed, and Ronan struck him with such a mighty blow from the <a href=\"/universal-weapon/4055-45949/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-45949\">universal weapon</a> that the left side of his head fractured. He was teleported away before Ronan could finish him off, so Ronan settled for executing House Fiyero instead.</p><p>Ravenous quickly received the necessary medical attention, getting prosthetics grafted to his head, and resumed his campaign against the Kree. In return, Ronan led the Kree to throw everything they still had against the Annihilation Wave. The two forces waged brutal war in the skies above Hala without realizing what was happening elsewhere. Galactus had been freed and in his rage was destroying the bulk of the Annihilation Wave. Ravenous suddenly found all his supply lines were nonexistant and reinforcements were the same.</p><p>The tide of battle turned against the Annihilation Wave, and Ravenous found himself in charge after Nova killed Annihilus in the wake of Galactus' devastating retaliation. He sued for a peace agreement and received ownership over several Kree territories along with all of the former Skrull Empire in return for an immediate end to the war. It was all his to rule from his new throneworld of <a href=\"/kree-lar/4020-56264/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56264\">Kree-Lar</a>. However, he ruled only as caretaker. Annihilus was reborn in a larval stage, and though he was tempted to kill the vulnerable Annihilus and keep power, his honor required him to do his duty and rule until Annihilus was fit to once again.</p><h3>Annihilation Conquest</h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/annihilation-conquest/4045-44982/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-44982\">Annihilation Conquest</a></p><p>When the new <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a>-led <a href=\"/phalanx/4005-9651/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9651\">Phalanx</a> invaded Kree space, Ravenous found his ceded Kree territories targeted for conquest as well. Ronan the Accuser, Super Skrull, Praxagora and the mysterious <a href=\"/wraith/4005-44589/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44589\">Wraith</a> paid him a visit while his forces did their best to defend Kree-Lar. At first, it appeared Ronan came to plea for an alliance against the Phalanx, but instead, Ronan revealed he really wanted something Ravenous did not realize was even there. Ravenous had almost literally been sitting on a force of 15,000 <a href=\"/kree-sentry/4005-23281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23281\">Kree Sentries</a> without knowing it, and Ronan was taking them to purge the Phalanx from Hala. Ravenous managed to convince Ronan to first use the Sentries to destroy the invading Phalanx on Kree-Lar and then provided Ronan with a fast vessel to get to Hala along with the Sentry fleet.</p><p>When the heroes on Hala succeeded in destroyed Ultron, the Phalanx troubles in Ravenous' ceded territories presumably ended.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218942-ravenous12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1218942\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.925\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218942-ravenous12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1218942\"><img alt=\"Knocked Off His Throne\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1218942-ravenous12.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218942-ravenous12.jpg 600w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1218942-ravenous12.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Knocked Off His Throne\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1218942-ravenous12.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1218942-ravenous12.jpg 600w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1218942-ravenous12.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Knocked Off His Throne</figcaption></figure><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/war-of-kings/4045-55758/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55758\">War of Kings</a></p><p>Ravenous later became embroiled in the war between the <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\">Shi'ar</a> and Kree due to <a href=\"/vulcan/4005-21233/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21233\">Emperor Vulcan</a> of the Shi'ar no caring that Ravenous' ceded territories were no longer part of the Kree Empire. Ravenous expressed that he would have gladly allied with the Shi'ar against the Kree if Vulcan had not insanely decided to attack him as well. Even after the Annihilation War and the attack by the Phalanx, his forces were formidable enough to hold off the Shi'ar and were even projected to force them back. However, Vulcan surprised him by dispatching <a href=\"/xenith/4005-6140/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6140\">Xenith</a> to assassinate him. The <a href=\"/strontians/4060-57197/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57197\">Strontian</a> female attacked him so fast and hard that he was no match for it, and it was only the intervention of <a href=\"/robbie-rider/4005-34272/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34272\">Robbie Rider</a>, a newly recruited Nova Centurion, that kept him from being killed.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"/blastaar/4005-10963/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10963\">Blastaar</a> had allied with the Shi'ar again him and was currently leading a campaign to conquer Kree-Lar and all of the Negative Zone territories. Ravenous was in no position to fight back and was too busy depending on Robbie Rider's constant concentration keeping Xenith at bay for both of their sakes. <a href=\"/nova/4005-2105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2105\">Nova</a> arrived just as Xenith broke free and saved both their lives by defeating her. However, Blastaar's forces were now at Ravenous' gates. Robbie Rider had already promised him the protection of the <a href=\"/nova-corps/4060-40482/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40482\">Nova Corps</a>, and Ravenous demanded it of Nova now. Without protection, it was clear that Blastaar would overrun his forces and have him killed. Nova successfuly negotiated with Blastaar to leave Kree-Lar by quietly threatening to do to Blastaar what he did to Annihilus.</p><p>Ravenous was peacefully extracted from Kree-Lar. Now dethroned, he became a prisoner of the Nova Corps for his crimes during the Annihilation War.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Ravenous is a being of immense physical strength and endurance. When bonded to his Currs, he is able to channel the energies of the Opposing Force which is said to make him the equal of a typical herald of Galactus. Since the Currs are the vessels of his Opposing Force, he loses this power when they are destroyed or no longer connected to him by their umbilicals. However, Currs can rapidly regenerate.</p>",

Pamela was attracted to him, but Moondragon found him lacking in intelligence. When Moondragon was finally reborn, she and Pamela chose to depart Titan. Demeityr tried to convince Pamela to stay, offering to find a surrogate to help care for Moondragon in her infant form, but Pamela was determined to leave. </p><p>Later, Pamela encountered members of the Dance race, and accessed her own innate superhuman powers. She somehow caused Demeityr to be teleported to her, and he joined her in her adventures. </p><p>Demeityr journeyed with the others to visit Moondragon's friend Cloud, but the reunion ended badly when Moondragon flew into a fit of rage over her still-young body. Demeityr left to join Pamela in her quarters, but they were interrupted by a psychic attack from Moondragon. Moondragon created an illusionary form of her old body, and attempted to seduce Demeityr, but he was too frightened by her to love her. Pamela and Demeityr tried to fight Moondragon, but she overcame both of them, and cast them into space. They were rescued by Cloud, just as Pamela's powers fully surfaced, transforming her into Sundragon. They forgave Moondragon for her actions and then set off into space.</p>",

He displays telepathy and is alluded to possess 5th-dimensional vision. The completely new senses entered his bloodline when the Superman of the 67th century married Gzntplzk, the Queen of the 5th Dimension. His only weakness is that he only maintains these powers under the light of the Super-Sun at the heart of the system. Beyond the system, his powers wane within days.</p><p>Individual powers he has displayed include</p><ul><li><strong>Super Strength</strong> - Even in a weakened state, Kal once punched through time itself, although he used Steel's Chronal Engine as a medium, so it is implied he could not do this unaided. Regardless, when charged by the Super Sun, Kal is easily one of the strongest beings to ever exist. The Hyperbolic tagline he relates to Superman claims he can leap from world to world in a single bound, and indeed, while weakened in the past, he leaped from Earth to the Moon having already lost his powers of flight.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Super-ESP</strong> - Assisting Superman in quelling a prison riot while visiting the past, Kal used raindrops he generated (seemingly through friction of his hands) to hypnotize the rioters. He later attempts to do something similar using what he calls a \"Sublim-level Hypno-Vibration.\"</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Super Speed Of Thought</strong> - Under the Super Sun Kal is capable of several billion calculations simultaneously.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Super Breath</strong> - Kal can super compress material in his lungs and blow it will great force, once blowing out Firestorm's nuclear powered hair. He has previously stated that he could snuff out a red giant star. (This could be hyperbole).</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Flight</strong> - Kal appears to have complete control over gravity's affect on his body, so much so that when his powers started to wain in the past, he was surprised to feel a slight tug before realizing that gravity was beginning to affect him.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Force Vision</strong> - Generating an energy field from his eyes, Superman can create force fields powerful enough to contain massive explosions; slightly weakened in the past, he once contained a one megaton blast. Back in his own era, he assisted <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\">Kyle Rayner</a> in containing a Supernova event.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Invulnerability</strong> - Kal is impervious to harm and unaffected by the elements. When his powers were failing in the past, he remarked that he had never before noticed the cold.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Electromagnetic Pulse</strong> - Kal can generate a localized electromagnetic pulse capable of knocking out nearby electronics.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Techno-Rapport</strong> - Kal can communicate with computerized devices; he was able to learn a security code for a door in Lex Luthor's compound using this ability.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Super-TK</strong> - Superman can mentally manipulate objects using a form of telekinesis. The <a href=\"/batman-1000000/4005-74689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74689\">Batman</a> of his era refers to this power has Kal's means of reprogramming the JLA teleporters when the Justice Legion Alpha infiltrates the Watchtower.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Super Hearing</strong> - Kal once heard J'onn J'onzz talking on Mars while containing a supernova with Kyle Rayner. This was in space, somewhere in the inner Solar System.</li></ul>",

<a data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\" href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\">  Robin</a>.  Seeing little other choice, Robin agreed to provide shelter for Bombshell.  </p> <br />As Robin left the Teen Titans due to his commitments in Gotham City, Bombshell's role on the team was unclear, as she did not get along with the remaining three members of the team, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40528\" href=\"/kid-devil/4005-40528/\">  Eddie Bloomburg</a>,<a data-ref-id=\"4005-4438\" href=\"/blue-beetle/4005-4438/\">   Blue Beetle</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10885\" href=\"/wonder-girl/4005-10885/\">  Wonder Girl</a>.  However, Amy decides to stay with the team and is a member when Wonder Girl selects the remaining members of her new Titan line-up.    <br /> <br />The Titan's battle with the demented <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9949\" href=\"/jericho/4005-9949/\">Jericho </a>in New York resulted in Ravager returning to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\" href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\">San Francisco</a> with the team.  The rivalry between the two ladies intensified and came to a head when Rose threatened Amy if she betrayed the team again.  Following this altercation, Bombshell and Ravager gained a respect for one another. <br /> <br />Bombshell has been proven to be a mainstay in the Titans line-up as she was present during the attack by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45188\" href=\"/fearsome-five/4060-45188/\">Fearsome Five</a>, the battle in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56179\" href=\"/dakota/4020-56179/\">Dakota</a>, and the fight against <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67084\" href=\"/wyld/4005-67084/\">Wyld</a>.  During the debacle with the mysterious Wyld, Amy and fellow teammate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4686\" href=\"/aquagirl/4005-4686/\">Aquagirl </a>were charged by Wonder Girl to open a dimensional portal in the depths of the<a data-ref-id=\"4020-56201\" href=\"/atlantic-ocean/4020-56201/\"> Atlantic Ocean</a>.  The local wildlife was adversely effected by Wyld's dimensional taint and they attacked the duo.  Once Wonder Girl's team arrives back at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55705\" href=\"/titans-tower/4020-55705/\">Titan's Tower</a>, the rest of the Titans discover that, despite Miss Martian attempting to help them, Bombshell and Aquagirl are lost at sea.  The hunt for the missing Teen Titans has already begun.<br /> <br /><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/252763-160866-bombshell.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-252763\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.78137651821862\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/252763-160866-bombshell.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-252763\"><img alt=\"Bulletproof skin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px\" data-width=\"247\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/252763-160866-bombshell.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/252763-160866-bombshell.jpg 247w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bulletproof skin\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/252763-160866-bombshell.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/252763-160866-bombshell.jpg 247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px\" data-width=\"247\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bulletproof skin</figcaption></figure><p>It is important to note that while Captain Atom and Major Force were both exposed to a nuclear explosion in addition to their dilustel exposure, Bombshell was only exposed to the dilustel.  It was originally believed this meant Bombshell's metal skin had not bonded to her body, though this was revealed to be untrue as Bombshell was later able to regenerate the metal covering on her skin and regain her powers after she had lost them. With the dilustel skin covering her body, she is able to access the Quantum Field for her superhuman abilities, consisting of superhuman strength in the 100-ton class (able to dish out blows powerful enough to stagger Miss Martian and Wonder Girl, as well as lift her Quantum Soldier jet with her strength alone), flight speed at Mach 3, the ability to absorb all forms of energy, and project blasts of Quantum energy. The metal skin renders her a significantly level of invulnerability, preferably bulletproof and impervious to physical damage from beings as strong as Wonder Girl without being breached. She can also generate energy waves that are powerful enough to scramble the minds of others and control technology powered by electromagnetism.  <br /> <br />While Bombshell does have access to the Quantum Field, the fact that she wasn't administered the alien metal with a nuclear explosion along with it could render her on a power level below that of Captain Atom (especially) and Major Force, not to mention the resilience of her metal skin (since the metal on her skin can be exploited by extreme temperatures much like Major Force's, though this same weakness was shown to be ineffective is a second go-around with Titans due to Bombshell showing the ability to absorb energy. Captain Atom, however, has never exhibited this weakness in the presence of extreme temperatures). Evidence of her power level was also supported by the fact that Miss Martian was able to read Bombshell's mind, finding out that she lied about detonating akin to an atomic bomb that would destroy everything within fifty miles of it, much like Captain Atom could. She has yet to exhibit abilities on par with Captain Atom, or learn to use her powers in ways that he's already shown.<br /></p>",

    "description": "<h2>Background Information </h2>Zoë was a <strong>Brown Coat</strong> (rank of Corporal) who fought for the <strong>Independence</strong> in the <strong>Unification War</strong> against the <strong>Alliance</strong>, alongside Sergeant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41697\" href=\"/malcolm-reynolds/4005-41697/\" slug=\"malcolm-reynolds\"> <strong>Malcolm Reynolds</strong></a>. Mal later became Captain aboard <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56486\" href=\"/serenity/4055-56486/\" slug=\"serenity\"> <strong>Serenity</strong></a>, and Zoë is second in command. It has been mentioned that if something were to happen to Mal, she would then inherit Serenity.    <br/><br/>She was married to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41802\" href=\"/wash/4005-41802/\" slug=\"wash\"> <strong>Hoban Washburne</strong></a>, who was the pilot of Serenity. At first she was put off by Wash, which may have had something to do with his moustache, but shortly after he joined the crew of Serenity they were wed.   Wash could sometimes be jealous of her close relationship with the Captain, and disliked the fact that she calls Mal “Sir”. They had a very strong, passionate marriage, even though they were complete opposites,  and since Zoë was more aggressive than Wash, so she tended to take on the male oriented roles of the relationship. The happy couple even thought about having children but when Wash was killed by a <strong>Reaver</strong> harpoon, any dreams of having a family together vanished.   <br/>One-shot comic book, <a data-ref-id=\"4050-33508\" href=\"/serenity-float-out/4050-33508/\" slug=\"serenity-float-out\">  Serenity : Float Out</a> revealed that Zoe is pregnant with Wash's daughter.  <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98260/2182406-sfo_026.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2182406\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.54140625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98260/2182406-sfo_026.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2182406\"><img alt=\"Pregnant Zoe \" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/98260/2182406-sfo_026.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98260/2182406-sfo_026.jpg 1280w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/9/98260/2182406-sfo_026.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/98260/2182406-sfo_026.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/98260/2182406-sfo_026.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Pregnant Zoe </figcaption></figure> <br/> <br/>Zoë is attractive, a skilled fighter, extremely strong willed, sensible and is capable of handling stressful situations calmly.  Her favourite weapon to use is a<strong> Mare’s Leg</strong>, which is a custom<strong> Winchester 1892 rifle</strong>.   She is referred to as a “Warrior Woman” by her husband Wash.  <br/><strong> <br/>Zoë Washburne</strong> was portrayed by <strong>Gina Torres</strong> in the TV series “<strong>Firefly</strong>” and in the motion picture <a data-ref-id=\"4025-140\" href=\"/serenity/4025-140/\" slug=\"serenity\"> “<strong>Serenity</strong>”</a>.    ",
