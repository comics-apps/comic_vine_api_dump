Damiella had accidentally told the Golden One she was fated to leave soon and forget the wonderful adventures she had here.

Damiella took blow after blow from her friend and finally convinced her with words to patch things up and go peacefully. A new rule, a young male boy, appeared in her place.</p><p>Damiella then bade farewell to her Avengers friends, staying behind with her love, a humanoid yeti named Hairball 2. </p>",

    "deck": "Taki is a character that appears in the Soul Calibur franchise. She is a stoic and skilled renegade ninja with various abilities and powers. Taki is equipped with twin short swords Mekki-maru and Rikki-maru and possesses great speed and agility, which she uses to great effect in pursuing the fabled sword Soul Edge.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>A fierce Demon Hunter and Kunoichi, Taki travels the world slaying evil supernatural beings and spirits. Born in Japan, Taki was orphaned at a young age. She had a brother, but he would pass as well to the same illness that their parents would fall victim to. Without any other relatives or support, she would subsequently taken in raised and trained by the infamous Fu-ma ninja clan.</p><p>Taki would be trained under Master Toki. Taki would grow into quite a skilled and disciplined Kunoichi, learning Musoh-Battoh-Ryu, Ninjutsu, and Taijutsu, as well various other ninja techniques and disciplines, as well as general skills such as blacksmithing.</p><p>Over her years of training, Taki would develop somewhat of a stoic and calm personality, being able to put aside emotions, and demonstrate disciplined and methodical approach to matters. This leading to some viewing her as cold and ruthless. Later in her life Taki would have a young apprentice in Natsu.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Taki is a fictional character that was first introduced in the Namco fighting game franchise Soul Calibur. Her character design is attributed to Kouji Mitsunaga. Her first appearance would be in the video game Soul Edge released in 1995. Like many of her popular Soul Calibur peers she would eventually go on to appear in the franchises other creative ventures, including comics, appearing in Soul Calibur #1 released in 1999.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Taki is a significantly popular character from the Soul Calibur series, frequently cited and mentioned as one of the most iconic fighters from the franchise. So much so that one of the main criticisms of the Soul Calibur 5 video game was its omission of her, notable as she had appeared in every installment prior.</p><p>Taki like many fighting game fighters, draws heavily upon certain tropes and stereotypes. In Taki's case, kunoichi and ninja tropes.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Soul Blade</h3><p>Towards the end of Taki's journey to destroy Soul Edge she would have to face the dread pirate <a href=\"/cervantes/4005-8653/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8653\">Cervantes.</a> Taki would be victorious and assist in saving <a href=\"/sophitia/4005-8656/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8656\">Sophitia</a> in the process. After defeating Cervantes, Taki would carry the wounded Greek warrior to safety. Cervantes defeated body would explode releasing evil energy that eventually come to inhibit the body of German Knight Siegfried.</p><h3>Soul Calibur 2</h3><p>In Soul Calibur Toki was still sending out assassins to kill Taki, but one time was different because the assassians that Toki had sent were ordered to capture her not kill her.Once Taki had defeated the ninjas she had searched their bodies and flung a metal fragment. Taki had then found out that master Toki was trying to find out information about Soul Edge, thats why Toki's ninjas were tying to keep her alive, so that she could tell Toki everything about Soul Edge. Taki knowing of all the notorious things that would happen if someone were to wield Soul Edge, knew that she could not let master Toki be the next wielder.</p><p>On Taki's journey back to Japan she sensed the precence of Soul Edge, she then knew that time was running out. Taki had then eventually tracked down Soul Edge to the Ostrheinsburg Chapel,an old chapel where Soul Edge and Soul Calibur had fought many years ago.When Taki had gotten there she had seen Heisharo Mitsurugi,another Soul Calibur figher who Taki has had countless runins with.She had seen that Mitsurugi was on his way to fight Soul Edge,but he had stopped, turned around and then he had seen Taki.</p><p>He had said to her, <em>\"I have had enough of you!\"</em>. Taki then replied after laughing and saying, \"Haven't you had enough?\". Taki then somersaulted near him and then they had begun to fight. When the battle was over,Taki had won.Before she was going to take on Soul Edge she had said to Mitsurugi that he needs to go home now knowing that Soul Edge was to powerful for him to face. As Taki had turned around she saw a bright light then she had seen Soul Edge. Everything around her was in flames like there last encounter but Taki soon realized that she was in Hell.</p><p>Before Taki and the dreadful sword were going to begin fighting, she powered up Meki-Maru,then the two fought three long battles. After the ballet was over and Taki landed her last blow to Soul Edge. Soul Edge had then begun to float in the air while screaming, Soul Edge had exploded and Soul Calibur was released and stuck into the ground.Moments later everything had cleared up and she was back at the Ostrheinsburg Chapel, but Soul Calibur was not there.Once she was back she had whispered the words to herself,\"Demon Captured!\".Taki had then set her sights east, she had felt another unusual presence somewhere there.As she headed out you could see a trail of energy coming from both Mekki-Maru and Rikki-Maru.</p><h3>Soul Calibur 3</h3><p>In Soul Calibur 3 Taki had taken on a new appearance. Instead of usually wearing crimson red she had worn navy blue and armor and an armor mask around her mouth.Taki had to face one of the only people in her life, Master Toki. Toki was still under the evil influence of Soul Edge. Taki and Toki had fought under the Hoko Temple, and with Toki being the one who had taught Taki everything she knows the battle was difficult.In the end Taki had won the battle. Before Taki was going to kill him Toki weakly said to Taki, <em>\"Taki.....is that you? its very dark...\"</em></p><p>When Taki had heard those words come from Toki she knew that it was really him and not the evil being controlling him.Then a spirit had come out of Toki's mouth and vanished into the air. Taki knew at that moment that she had to stop and destroy Soul Edge, before Toki would.Since the sword was weakened it would not be difficult to find. Taki had then tracked a piece of the sword to Japan where she found out that an old enemy had it, Mitsurugi.</p><p>Taki demanded that he hand over the shard of the sword, so she attacked, but Mitsurugi was able to block the attacks. Mitsurugi then told her, \"If you want it so badly come take it by force!\" Taki then replied saying, \"Soul Edge your scars run deep, even in death.\" The two then began to continue the fight, but no one knows what the outcome of this battle was.</p><h3>Soul Calibur 4</h3><p>In Soul Calibur 4 Taki had sought to put a complete end to Soul Edge and Soul Calibur. Taki had believed that both of the swords had caused way to much damage to the world and for to long. Taki had set out on a journey to destroy the blades and she had killed anyone that stood in her way of destroying the swords. Her final battle was against Sigefried, he was the latest possessor of Soul Calibur. At the end of Taki's battle against Sigefried they both had landed a strike on each other but Taki had no damage against her, but Sidefried did.</p><p>As Sigefried dropped to the ground he began taking to Taki saying, \" Why do you stand in my way. Are you saying that my way is wrong, and that I will fail? \" Taki then replied saying, \" Unfortunately, yes.\" Taki explained to Siegfried that we must face our fears by ourselves. Sigefried still holding Soul Calibur, was then embodied in crystals freezing him because of Soul Calibur. As he was being crystallized, Taki quietly walked away. There is no way to know how Taki lived there on out, she sealed such a great evil away and then disappeared from history.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Taki wields Kodachi short swords, her most common pair referred to as Rekki-Maru and Mekki-Maru.</p><p>With Taki being trained by master Toki she has learned many techniques and the powers that Toki granted her have come useful from time to time. Taki is benn trained to becoming a ninja since she was a child. Taki is a Ninjutsu practitioner being able to perform various acrobatic moves with great speed. She is very good at dodging as well being able to cart-well or even teleport out of the way of attacks from enemies. With Taki's magic powers the most of her attacks with them cannot be blocked by anything. Her main magic moves that she uses are possession, teleportation and ninja cannon.</p><p>Taki's ninja cannon allows her to store energy within the palm of her hands and then hitting her enemy with concussive force. Taki's main use of defense are her twin blades Mekki-Maru and Rikki-Maru. She carries these two swords with one on her back and one on her back hip. Taki uses her twin blades very quickly and with Rikki-Maru being charges, her attacks with Rekki-Maru will be much stronger than her attacks with Meki-Maru. Taki has a favorite attack that she uses to finish her opponents off.</p><p>First Taki would hold both of her blades together and say ougi! then Taki would do a kick and back-flip off her opponent. She would then cast a spell on her body to duplicate herself into three people and slice her opponent from every angle on their body. Finally for her final hit she would jump into the sky and stab her opponent in the head killing them.</p><h4>Physical Characteristics</h4><ul><li><strong>Height:</strong> 5'7\"</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 117 lbs</li><li><strong>Eyes</strong>: Brown</li><li><strong>Hair</strong>: Black</li></ul><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Video Games</h3><ul><li>Soul Edge (1995)</li><li>Soulcalibur (1998)</li><li>Soulcalibur II (2002)</li><li>Soulcalibur III (2005)</li><li>Soulcalibur IV (2008)</li><li>Soulcalibur: Lost Swords (2014)</li></ul><p> </p>",

The Gods of Asgard are also granted certain mystical abilities that in the past have shown to get them the power to change their appearance, transform matter and wield a numerous amount of different energies.

He can create dangerous and useful weapons from his body with a single thought. This Rex is created by Men Of Action. They created the character, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48499\" href=\"/ben-10/4005-48499/\">Ben 10</a>, who had a team-up with Rex in a comic book. Generator Rex doesn't resemble the original M. Rex, and Man Of Action has a different storyline and layout for Generator Rex in the Cartoon Network show version.</p><h2>Origin Of \"Generator\" Rex</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46951/1411268-generatorrex001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411268\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.27\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46951/1411268-generatorrex001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411268\"><img alt=\"The main cast.\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46951/1411268-generatorrex001.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46951/1411268-generatorrex001.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px\" data-width=\"755\"></a><figcaption>The main cast.</figcaption></figure><p>Rex lives in a world where nanites have infected every living thing on the planet. Nanites infect every living thing on the planet due to something referred to simply as \"the Event\", which unleashed all the nanites due to careless scientists trying to make very small nanotech robots. Later the motives behind the Event are revealed to be intentional, with Rex's brother Cesar Salazar setting off the event in order to save Rex from death and the Nanite Project (referred to many times simply as \"The Project\") from the hands of Van Kleiss. Normally these machines are harmless, but occasionally they will mutate living things into monsters called EVOs. EVOs normally are mindless monsters who mutate from human or animal/insect life due to the nanites malfunctioning, and Providence has three options on how to handle them: cure them, using Rex; containing them; or killing them. This is simply referred to as the \"Cure, Contain or Kill\" protocol. Rex himself is an EVO, but unlike most EVOs he is able to control his nanites to create machines and make almost any machine he can think of out of his body parts. The most common machines he creates are his Smackhands, Punk Busters, Slam Cannon, Boogie Pack, BFS and the Rex Ride. Later, when he is injected with the Master Control nanite by Doctor Rylander, he can create updated versions of his original machines and create new ones, like a giant whip and a hoverboard, but needs to concentrate to make the upgrades. As his skill level and experience increases he can summon the upgraded versions with more and more ease.</p><p>Rex works for an organization called Providence, which was founded to protect Earth from EVOs, and helps battle EVOs with Six and Bobo, fellow Providence agents. Bobo Haha is a chimpanzee EVO, which is apparent by his ability to talk. Rex is the only one in the world who is able to \"cure\" other EVOs of their condition. By curing, Rex reprograms all the renegade nanites and returns the EVO to their normal human or animal form. Rex also suffers from amnesia, and Providence has promised him that they would help him discover his past in return for working with them.</p><p>The second season of generator Rex explores more about Rex's clouded origins. In the television series' second season (in the episode \"Rabble\"), Rex is on a mission in Tokyo and runs into a group of teenage EVOs who are able to control their nanites. His orders from Providence are to neutralize the EVOs, but when he confronts the leader, Tuck, he regards Rex as a friend, and reveals that he knew Rex years ago, part of the period that Rex fails to remember due to his amnesia. Rex recieves small flashes of old memories that support the claims of the EVO during the mission. It is revealed that Rex was in fact the leader of the teenagers, and that there was a possible relationship going on between him and another member of the group, Cricket. Cricket is shown to still have feelings for Rex, even after all the years he was gone. They also show him things from his past life, which reveals that he was an entirely different person from who he is today; he would lead them in criminal heists, steal from many places, and even worked for some time with an EVO crime boss who called himself Quarry, because he was made of rock and had rock-related abilities. Quarry and Rex later have an encounter, and it is revealed that Rex kept a journal for himself, because his amnesia spells were frequent and he needed to remember his life before. Quarry was in possession of Rex's journal of his past life, and used it as leverage over Rex so he would work for him and defy Providence and their orders. Rex makes a bold move and destroys the journal and defeats Quarry. He has to say goodbye to his old friends, who promise not to cause any more trouble with Providence and the police.</p><p>In another episode (\"Promises, Promises\", episode 19), Agent Six remembers how Rex started working for Providence. Back when Six and White were partners, they were sent on a mission to Mexico to fight what appeared to be the first EVO with inorganic properties. It displayed what are recognized as Rex's Smackhands, Punk Busters, Boogie pack and BFS. It isn't clearly shown or explained how Rex got this EVO's properties. The main scientist back then, Dr. Fell, was interested only in \"disassembling\" EVOs (basically killing them and getting the exact same results every time) wanted to capture this one and disassemble it. His assistant, Doctor Holiday, was against this protocol and believed in a cure for EVOs. She told Six about her theory, which White thought was only wishful thinking and a weakness. Six still listened, and when the mission caused the EVO to explode, he was thrown back into the wreckage of a town. Under a heap of rubble, he found an unconcious 14-year old boy, who turns out to be Rex. He wakes up, but has just had an amnesia attack, and remembers nothing of his previous life. Six decides to rescue him, and Rex tags along as they navigate through the ruins of the town. They are attacked by an EVO, and when it appears Six is defeated, Rex boldly goes up to the EVO and lays his hand on it, curing it. Six then realizes that Rex is Holiday's cure, and decides to bring him back to Providence. White is skeptical that he is rescuing this boy, and doesn't know that Rex is an EVO and is the cure. Six hides Rex away in the base and tells Holiday about him. White is suspicious, and overhears some of the conversation, and then kidnaps Rex and brings him to the head scientist, who wants to disassemble him. They start the process right away, and Six wakes up, and sees it happening. He tries to stop the process, but White tries to kill Rex instead, seeing that Six is attached to him. As White attacks Rex with a gun, Six uses his superior swordsmanship skills and splits the bullets in half, where they go to either side of Rex and don't harm him. White overpowers Six eventually, and tries to kill Rex with one of Six's swords, but Rex's nanites protect him and adapt so that White can't hurt him. The lab system begins to fail, and as the disassembly process goes out of control, and White, making a bold move, helps Six and Rex escape while sacrificing himself and being locked inside the lab by the safety procedures. Six is devastated and tries to rescue him, but the doors are shut tight and he can't help his best friend. Rex shuts off the lab with his nanites just in time to save White, but White is now fully sterilized and nanite-free, so he has to be in a nanite-free chamber at all times to this day. After that, Rex starts to train with Bobo and Six and to officially work for Providence.</p><h2>Television</h2><p><strong>Generator Rex</strong></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1207576-picture_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1207576\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1945606694561\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1207576-picture_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1207576\"><img alt=\"Rex messes with Kleiss\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-width=\"478\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1207576-picture_4.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1207576-picture_4.png 478w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Rex messes with Kleiss\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1207576-picture_4.png\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/1207576-picture_4.png 478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-width=\"478\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rex messes with Kleiss</figcaption></figure><p>Rex (voiced by Daryl Sabara) is the titular character and protagonist of this television series. It is still running on Cartoon Network and currently in its second season. In it, Rex works for Providence, an organization dedicated to saving the world from rogue EVOs, battling his enemies and trying to discover his past. He frequently clashes with the Pack, the main villains of the series, and Van Kleiss, the resident supervillain. The fifteen-year-old is all about having fun, and sometimes doesn't take his job seriously, which is shown by him breaking out of Providence on \"road trips\" and forgetting the cost of his careless actions, which can mean lives. He likes to \"mess around\", and when authority figures tell him to get it together, he acts like a normal teenager and defies them. He has a sidekick, a chimpanzee named Bobo Haha, who is a self-proclaimed bad influnce who often gives sarcasm at the most inopportune times, such as in the middle of battle. Rex's only \"normal\" friend is a kid named Noah, who Rex sneaks out to talk to and play basketball with. It was revealed in the series that Noah in fact works for Providence, but that Rex was not to know, until Noah revealed the fact to Rex. Rex also has a girlfriend of sorts, Circe, who is a member of the Pack. She believes Van Kleiss is the good guy, and Rex is delusioned, and whenever the two meet, Rex tries to bring her to his side. The two began to get close in the series' third episode, \"Beyond the Sea\".</p><p>Rex's mentor and father figure is Agent Six, although no relation between the two has been revealed or hinted at. It was revealed in the second season that Six was the one who originally found Rex and discovered his EVO abilities right after his latest amnesia attack. Six acts as Rex's handler, and is all about the rules and following orders, although he has shown a more caring side recently to Rex, by showing empathy when he runs out or doesn't feel \"normal\". Doctor Holiday is the mother figure of sorts, who Rex had an obvious attraction to in the series' first couple episodes. She seems to understand Rex more than anyone, since she relates to his human side more and she is Providence's \"resident expert\" on the nanites.</p><p>When Rex encounters one of the original scientist who experimented with nanites right before the Event, Rylander, the scientist injects a special nanite into him as a last resort before he fights with Van Kleiss, who wants the nanite for himself. After Holiday studies it, she figures out that it is a controller nanite, called the Omega-One Nanite, which gives Rex access to even more abilities and things he can make his nanites do. He makes a \"second generation\" of sorts of his old machines, but improves them and instead of being orange, they now glow blue. He can so far create giant cylinders in place of his Smackhands, which when pounded together release a pulse of energy; a tentacle whip which he can use to swing over gaps and grab enemies; and two glowing axes which he uses as pickaxes and weapons. These second-generation machines are usually harder for Rex to build, since they require more concentration than his first-generation machines, which are second-nature to him, though he seems to be getting over this weakness.Rex recently showed he can now form two different machines at once.</p><h2>M Rex</h2><p>Rex is an adventurous kid who is raised by a man named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70592\" href=\"/spilken/4005-70592/\">Spilken</a>. Rex doesn't know anything about his family, and Spilken promised that one day he would help him find his family. In the mean time, Spilken has taught Rex the \"trade\", which appears to be stealing from others.

Rex quickly runs, while Six sends his monkeys after Rex. The monkeys cornered Rex, and he thought they were going to kill him, when the floor suddenly opened up underneath him.</p><p>Rex fell onto a bunch of flowers which belonged to Mia, who was getting ready for a show that night on the cruise ship. Mia went to go get something for Rex, to help him out since he had fallen from the ceiling. But when she turned around again, Rex had already taken off. Rex finds his way to the stage, where Mia is introducing Simon to the audience. But as Simon is giving his speech, the slot machines turned into giant robots and started attacking people. Rex was going to take off running, but when Mia was in trouble, he stayed behind to help her. As Mia and Rex were about to be attacked by a robot, Rex's hands started to glow and two giant metal fists appeared in front of him and crushed the enemy robots.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>M Rex has nanotech colony living in his heart, which has granted him abilities beyond his wildest imagination. These tiny robots do what they can to protect Rex by affecting the world around him (like causing the floor to open up so he could escape from the killer monkeys). The most interesting part of these nanotech robots is that they are programmed to make anything that Rex can think of. They can form any weapon, vehicle, or object that Rex imagines, like the giant fists that crushed the killer robots. Rex also has meta-nanites in his system which can be used to give him almost any power including nigh omnipotence.</p>",

    "description": "<strong><u>Strengths <br /></u></strong> <p>As  one of the commanders on the Whitebeard pirate crew. Jozu has shown that  he is a powerful member of the crew. During the meeting between his  captain and Red Haired Shanks, Jozu was not affected by the amazing  spirit that Shanks showed. Jozu also has shown to possess incredible  ammounts of physcial strength, able to lift a large chunk of ice and  throw it at the marine giants. The chunk of ice was so large it dwarfed  the giants by a large margin. Though Jozu is a large man, his speed  matches his incredible strength. He was able to suprise Crocodile with  his speed, and hit him before he could activate his devil fruit powers.  He also may have the use of Haki. <br /> <br /></p><h3><u>Devil Fruit <br /></u></h3> <br />Jozu  has an unnamed devil fruit power which allows him to turn his entire  body, or just parts of his body into diamond. This gives him the  nickname Diamond Jozu. With this devil fruit power, his durability  increases, able to take the worlds strongest slash from Mihawk with no  damage. It also increases his strength.",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p> </p><p>Little is known about Marco's past , but he has been around for various important events. Marco appears to be one of the older members of the whitebeard Pirates , as he is seen when Shiki first visits Whitebeard , and he is the 1st divison commander . He was the first to befriend Portgas D Ace , and talk him into joining them , even protesting Ace leaving to find Teach. Marco was also present when Shanks arrived to talk to Whitebeard , and later fought at Marineford to save Ace. With the death of Whitebeard , Marco is the highest ranked member of the crew . </p><p> </p><h3>Abilities and Powers</h3><p> </p><p>Marco has consumed an unnamed Mythical Zoan Fruit , which allows him to becom a Phoenix , and even a hybrid . Unlike most Zoan users , he is capable of turning certian parts of his body into a phoenix (in most occasions just his arms) while remaining human . When he transforms he has increased speed , flight , and healing . In addition to his powers Marco also possesses incredible strength and reflexes (capable of dodging and striking Kizaru who can move at the speed of light) . Marco also possesses Busoshoku Haki , which inhances his attacks and allows him to render logia users tangible as he used while fighting against Akainu and Kizaru.After the events of Marineford it was stated by Gorosei that Marco is one of the few pirates that is capable of taking down.</p>",

Alvin is the main protagonist and sometimes antagonist of the series. Alvin is impulsive, rude, charming and the leader of \"Alvin and The Chipmunks.\" Alvin is self centered most of the time, but he will stick up for his brothers. He might act like the tough/cool guy all the time, but when it comes to his brothers getting hurt Alvin will jump up and help them immediately. Alvin's favorite color is red, and his signature letter is on his shirt. Alvin shares a love/hate relationship with one of the chipettes. Her name is Brittnay. Alvin and his brothers share many adventures, but it is usually bad. Alvin starts all the adventures, however it is usually only going to benefit Alvin. Alvin has little care for rules, he does not mind breaking into a closed area. Simon and Theodore don't usually follow, but if it is a benefit for them also. Dave usually screams Alvin's name this is famous.",

    "description": "<h2>Biography</h2>Simon is the 2nd oldest brother of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70610\" href=\"/alvin/4005-70610/\">Alvin</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70612\" href=\"/theodore/4005-70612/\">Theodore</a>. He is the smartest of all chipmunks, and is said to be as smart as Einstein. Simon has a relationship with  Jeanette, a Chipette. Just like Simon, she is the 2nd oldest of her sisters Britney and Elenor, and she is as smart as Simon too. Simon and Jeanette share a relationship that is somewhat on and somewhat off. Since they are usually shy towards each other, they do not speak much. However, Simon shows Jeanette that he cares and loves towards her. For some reason, SImon needs glasses this is never explained in the comics or the TV show. Simon might be the 2nd oldest, but he is the tallest of all chipmunks. Although, Simon, Alvin, and Theodore are triplets, Alvin is the one in control. Simon does not like some of Alvin's tactics, but they are usually helpful in some of their sticky situations. Simon knows Alvin is the oldest by 5 minutes, however, Simon would probably be a better older brother. When it comes down Simon is always ready to help his older brother, Simon has said before that \"we might be the two sides of a coin.\"",

When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70610\" href=\"/alvin/4005-70610/\">Alvin</a> has a plan, and Simon won't go along Alvin will trick Theodore into helping him. Theodore is not that smart and is easily tricked, his favorite color is green. Theo shares a relationship with the chipette Eleanor. Eleanor is also the youngest in the Chipette band. Theodore is really sensitive about his weight, he does not like anyone calling him \"fat\" or any other fat names. So Alvin and Simon have to protect him more when bullies try to beat up on their little brother. Theodore is said to be a great cook.",

    "deck": "Sengoku was the previous Fleet-Admiral of the Navy until after the Paramount War. He was a former admiral during the battle of the edd war. He has the mythical zoan type devil fruit Human Human fruit model: Daibutsu. He is close friends with vice admiral Garp.",
    "description": "<h2>Appearance<br /></h2> <p>Sengoku is tall roughly middle-aged man with a long braided beard and a mustache. He is usually seen with his pet goat. Most of the time he wears glasses and a full Marine Admiral uniform that's adorned with medals. The most distinctive feature of this uniform is a life-size seagull on top of his cap, and his huge Marine coat, which he wears like a cape. His cap usually covers his hair, which is an afro. When he uses his powers, his hat is usually off revealing his afro. </p> <p>Twenty years before the present storyline, while Sengoku was still an Admiral, he did not cover his afro and had a beardless face. He also wore a regular suit attire than he does in the present storyline, which is unlike a typical Admiral's formal suit. The only Marine related attire he wore at the time apparently was his Marine coat, draped over like a cape However, when he was fighting Shiki in Marineford, he was wearing a black suit.  <br />  <br /></p> <h2>Personality <br /></h2>  He appears to be a proud man who is loyal to the World Government and never questions orders. He also won't accept any reason for letting a criminal go and also has a habit of getting very irritated with failure. From his view, the Shichibukai are just pirates <u>,</u> though he notes how valuable they could be when the time comes. However as years went by, he appears to be losing his faith in the Government, shown after the Whitebeard war he was angry at the order from the Government that there was to be no bounty on the Blackbeard pirates to cover up the shame, thus placing nations in danger. He has shown his ruthlessness, during the War, when he transformed into a giant Buddha, to attack Luffy, M. 3 lives were in vain, trying to save Portgas D. Ace and when the Blackbeard Pirates attempted to destoy Marineford and nearly succeeding in destroying the Blackbeard Pirates.  <p>As of lately, it would seem that he has become concerned over the movements of the Luffy and his crew , and has followed their movements ever since leaving water 7 , though his current concern is about the upcoming war against whitebeard , to the point that he brushed off the incident of the attack of a <a href=\"http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/World_Nobles\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>to the admirals . Upon hearing Luffy's break-in of impel down<a href=\"http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Impel_Down\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Sengoku was so frustrated that he almost took it out on Garp, and has come lose his patience with the antics of Garps<a href=\"http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Monkey\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>family in general. </p> <p>Sengoku also thinks and believe's that a person's birth (with the consideration of the parents' reputation) is enough to determine the potential impact they could bring to the world if left unchecked, such as Ace being Roger's son, and Luffy being Dragon's son <u>.</u> This is shown at Ace's execution where one of the main reasons for Ace's execution was not because he was a pirate, but because he is the son of Gol D. Roger and he believes that Ace must be executed by all means even if this meant an all out war with Whitebeard. </p> <p> Sengoku the Buddha may seem ironic at best, because through the course of the series he is shown to be quite capable of violence.It remarked on this irony when the Shichibukai convened at Mariejois to chose a succesor for Crocodile. However, with the revelation of his Devil Fruit, it would seem his epithet's origins come from his fruit's ability, exactly like the three current admirals . He also appears to have some common sense, as shown when he ordered the Whitebeard war to be over and tend to the wounded. His justice isn't as uncompromising as Akainus ; it seems to be more of a mix of both absolute and moral, as he did make a large speech about morality. He also called the war to an end upon Ace and Whitebeard's demises, after Shanks made his appearance. An another hint of Moral Justice is also shown when he gets infuriated when the world government decides to cover-up the break-out of the impel down prisoners released by Blackbeard, although he said once not to question the world government . </p> <h2>Powers and Abilities </h2> <p> Sengoku ate the \"Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Daibutsu\", a rarer-than logia mythical-zoan class devil fruitwhich allows him to turn into a gigantic daibutsu, which is probably the reason for his nickname. Nearby Marines claim that they have never seen him use this power before the war. </p> <p>While enlarging, his Marine jacket, glasses, and pants enlarge with him; his uniform, which also enlarges, seems to be tied around his waist, though he was not seen doing it during the transformation. The color of his body (and uniform) seems to change to a golden skin color, similar to a polished gold statue. In this form his body has different proportions, his torso and arms are much larger compared to the rest of his body. </p> <p>This ability gives him a massive power boost to his already impressive strength, enough to cause the execution stand to collapse in one indirectly connecting punch, despite the combined effort of Luffy's gear third and Mr. 3's candle wall to absorb the attack. He can also launch an explosive shock wave with a palm thrust, enough to send a majority of the Blackbeard Pirates flying a fair distance.

    "deck": "Kizaru is an Admiral of the Navy. He has the Glint-Glint Fruit. He was the main antagonist of the Sabaody Archipelago arc. His real name is Borsalino.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><h2>Creation</h2><p>Borsalino (ボルサリーノ, Borusarīno) is an antagonist from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/one-piece/4050-21397/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21397\"><i>One Piece</i></a> series that was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eiichiro-oda/4040-55855/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-55855\">Eiichiro Oda</a>. The series first began serialization in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shueisha/4010-1867/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1867\">Shueisha's</a> <i>Weekly Shōnen Jump</i> on August 4, 1997. He would later appear during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc that began in Volume 50.</p><p>He first appeared in <i>One Piece</i> Volume 52, CH. 504 <i>\"Pirate Frontline On The Move!!\"</i>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h2>Personality</h2><p>Kizaru is a very laid-back and easygoing person, speaking rather slowly and occasionally drawing out the last word of his sentences, which is strange considering this behavior is in direct contrast with his Devil Fruit power. He takes everything lightly regardless of the severity of the moment. In surprising, perilous and unexpected situations, he is apparently never shocked and even when a pirate fired a bullet at him, he seemed to be focused only on calling his subordinate. He even asked the offenders where his subordinate was. After uprooting a mangrove tree, he laughed to himself that the force he used was a tad excessive.</p><p>He is also completely calm and cool-headed, even in tense situations, such as when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/basil-hawkins/4005-72305/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72305\">Basil Hawkins</a> appeared unharmed by his attack, or when <a title=\"Silvers Rayleigh\" href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silvers-rayleigh/4005-72490/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72490\">Silvers Rayleigh</a> appeared. He speaks in a politely sarcastic manner and is very mocking towards his enemies, such as mocking Luffy for being too weak. He often taunts and belittles his foes in and out of battle, such as taunting Whitebeard about Luffy being too feeble to lead the charge towards the execution platform.</p><p>Unfortunately for the World Government, he can be quite absent-minded and irresponsible, judging by the fact he used a lot of power in a kick directed at the escaping pirates, knocking down the surface part of a Mangrove tree, and tried to call <a title=\"Sentomaru\" href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentomaru/4005-89412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89412\">Sentomaru</a> with a black Den Den Mushi, which is only used for intercepting communications. He also seems to prefer his own name, Borsalino, rather than his alias.</p><p>After Luffy sent a Celestial Dragon flying during the Sabaody incident, Kizaru volunteered to be dispatched by <a title=\"Sengoku\" href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sengoku/4005-70626/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70626\">Sengoku</a> to deal with the nobles' predicament, partly to fulfill his duty as an Admiral and because he was under the impression that a trip down to the Archipelago to expel the pirate threat would be mostly relaxing and was seemingly disappointed when Silvers Rayleigh came out to confront him.</p><p>If nothing else, Kizaru appears to be more lax than Aokiji, such as when Luffy, Jinbe and Law escaped from Marineford, he completely dropped the matter, his attitude regarding it being that of a carefree reaction.</p><p>However, while he never has expressed any sympathy for or against the philosophy of Absolute Justice, Kizaru's careless behavior displays a lack of mercy towards his enemies, particularly pirates whom he has targeted. Kizaru even decided to apprehend Silvers Rayleigh, who had retired from piracy over twenty years earlier, simply because, as a member of the Roger Pirates, his crimes could not be forgiven. Following the events of the Sabaody Archipelago, Kizaru arrested 500 pirates. Also, he sees the <a title=\"Shichibukai\" href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shichibukai/4060-48019/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48019\">Shichibukai</a> as nothing more than pirates, even if they are on the World Government's side. Even when Little Oars Jr. was bloody and dying after having lost a leg, Kizaru showed no mercy and simply offered to go ahead and shoot Little Oars Jr. through the head. As revealed by the author, his motto is \"unclear justice.\"</p><p>Kizaru often comments that some of the abilities of his opponents are quite frightening. One instance was after he witnessed the Devil Fruit abilities of three Supernovas, he referred to them as monsters, although he was otherwise unfazed by them. Another was after he tried to directly attack Whitebeard, First Division Commander <a title=\"Marco\" href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marco/4005-70609/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70609\">Marco</a> intercepted his attack with ease which made Kizaru point out how scary the Whitebeard Pirates were. When Luffy was launched towards the execution platform and stood before all three admirals, Kizaru commented that this youth was \"scary\".</p><p>The most recent occurrence was when Benn Beckman aimed a gun at him, although in that case Kizaru said it sarcastically and still succeeded in getting in an attack while Beckman was shocked that he was not done yet. Since Kizaru always delivers such admissions of fear with a deadpan expression on his face and his usual lackadaisical tone of voice, it is never clear if he is mocking his opponents or if he is being serious.</p><p>It is shown, however, in his fight with Zephyr that he is somewhat capable of fear, as he seemed scared when Z decided to unleash the power of the Dyna Stone, and even possibly terrified when it was about to literally blow up in his face.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Kizaru ate the Glint Glint Devil Fruit, or Pika Pika no Mi, turning him into a light man. This is a logia class devil fruit, and it enables Kizaru to travel at the speed of light either by dispersing into light particles or by travelling through the reflections created by his Yata No Kagami for more precise movements. This power is devastatingly effective on the battle field, Kizaru has used this ability to travel at light speed towards a target and meterialise at the last moment to deliver a frighteningly powerful kick. His catch phrase is \"Speed is weight, have you ever been kicked at the speed of light?\"</p><p>Kizaru can also shoot concentrated blasts of light from either his fingers or feet, these blasts can range from being small scale piercing attacks which go through the human body at high hyper-sonic speeds or they can can cause a big enough explosion to level a large mangrove, and even a small town. </p><p>Furthermore Kizaru can reduce his weight to almost nil due to light's negligible mass, allowing him to float in the air, he canalso shoot barrages of light beams at his enemies as seen in the War of the Best when he used this move to attack Whitebeard but was intercepted by the Commander of the Whitebeard pirate's 2nd division, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marco/4005-70609/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70609\">Marco the Phoenix</a>.</p><p>Kizaru can also form light into a solid state to make a sword, which he used to engage with Silvers Rayleigh in a sword fight.</p><p>As a logia devil fruit consumer, physical attacks that are not enhanced by busoshoku haki will phase through his body. As seen on Sabaody Archipelago, bullets and swords pass harmlessly through him, however an explosion made by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scratchmen-apoo/4005-72307/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72307\">Scratchmen Apoo</a> that occurred directly on his body did make his limbs and upper half of his body fly off. But the light man wasn't truly damaged, he shortly reformed his body by dispersing into light particles.</p><p>It should be noted that Kizaru <strong>can only</strong> move at light speed when in a complete light state <strong>or</strong> using the Yata no Kagami, he <strong>cannot trade punches and kicks at the speed of light</strong>, his overall combat speed is high hyper-sonic and further enhanced when using Kenbunshoku Haki.</p><p> </p><h2>Haki</h2><p>In the world of One Piece, there are three types of Haki:</p><p>Busoshoku Haki (armament haki/ color of the arms)</p><p>Kenbunshoku Haki (observation haki/ color of observation)</p><p>and</p><p>Haoshoku Haki (conqueror's haki/ color of the conquering king) </p><p> </p><p>It is stated that all Marines ranked Vice Admiral and above are proficient in at least the two common forms of Haki: Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku. Since Kizaru is an admiral, he knows these two types:</p><p> </p><p><strong>Busoshoku Haki:</strong> this power manifests an invisible armor around the body making their attack and defense much more effective, they can also project this power outwards for long range attacks, and this Armament Haki is the only known counter measure against Devil Fruit users, as it enables the users to hit their 'true forms' bypassing any elemental advantage a Logia Fruit user might have or any type of physical immunity a Paramecia Fruit user might have.</p><p>Kizaru has not been seen utilizing the enhanced version of this type of Haki- coating a selected limb with black Haki, hardening the skin into a state much stronger than steel which varies in durability according to the user's will power.</p><p>Kizaru has used this power in conjuction with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/characters/\">Akainu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kuzan/4005-67028/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67028\">Aokiji</a> to block a shock wave from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/whitebeard/4005-69573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69573\">Whitebeard </a>which had previously destroyed the huge stone wall and would have gone on to destroy the execution stand at Marineford.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111171443/4737708-7863275068-The_A.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4737708\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111171443/4737708-7863275068-The_A.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4737708\"><img alt=\"The three Admirals forming a Busoshoku barrier to stop Whitebeard's Quake\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111171443/4737708-7863275068-The_A.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111171443/4737708-7863275068-The_A.png 1280w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11117/111171443/4737708-7863275068-The_A.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111171443/4737708-7863275068-The_A.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The three Admirals forming a Busoshoku barrier to stop Whitebeard's Quake</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Kenbunshoku Haki: </strong>The user can also use this Haki to predict an opponent's moves shortly before they make them, thereby making the attack much easier to evade with enough skill. This prediction appears to the user as an image or brief \"premonition\" of what the opponent will do in the user's <a title=\"wikipedia:Mind's eye\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%27s_eye\" rel=\"nofollow\">mind's eye</a>, and the damage the user will take if the attack actually \"hits\". This power also allows the user to sense the presence even if they are concealed from view or too far to see naturally, people or animals have auras which surround them that the Kenbunshoku Haki user can see. Furthermore this type of Haki can be used to sense how powerful a being is and their emotional state.</p>",

Ace</a>, one of the division commanders of <a href=\"/whitebeard/4005-69573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69573\">Whitebeard</a>. Whitebeard arrived with his entire armada, and a massive war broke out. The admirals remained mostly uninvolved in the first stage of the war. They mostly defended the execution grounds. However, Akainu put his own plot into motion. He had tricked <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/squard/4005-89450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89450\">Squard</a>, one of Whitebeard allies, into thinking Whitebeard was going to sacrifice his entire fleet to save Ace. Squard turned on Whitebeard, piercing him through the chest, but it didn't kill him.</p><p>After Ace was freed by Monkey D. Luffy, Akainu successfully taunted Ace into attacking him. This gave him the chance to kill Luffy, but Ace jumped in front of the attack and soon died. Much of the Whitebeard crew were then trying to escape with Luffy and avoid Akainu. his pursuit was relentless until Whitebeard stepped in. Akainu and Whitebeard had a ruthless battle, but Whitebeard wouldn't stop no matter how many of Akainu's attacks he suffered.</p><p>After Whitebeard was finally killed by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/blackbeard/4005-47948/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47948\">Blackbeard</a>, Akainu returned to his pursuit of Luffy. He was able to strike at Luffy with his magma attack through<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/jimbei/4005-68862/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68862\"> Jimbei</a>. They were both able to escape aboard the submarine of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/trafalgar-law/4005-66754/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66754\">Trafalgar Law</a>. When Coby, one of the Navy soldiers, pleaded for the fighting to end, Akainu was ready to kill him for disobeying orders to wipe out the pirates, but he was saved by the arrival of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shanks/4005-49627/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49627\">Shanks</a>, another of the Four Emperors. <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sengoku/4005-70626/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70626\">Fleet-Admiral Sengoku</a> ended the war when Shanks threatened to become involved if the senseless killing didn't stop.</p><h3>Fish-Man Island Arc</h3><p>After the events at Marineford during the war, Fleet-Admiral Sengoku was retiring and had planned to appoint <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kuzan/4005-67028/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67028\">Aokiji</a> to the position. World Government officials pushed for Akainu. Aokiji strongly objected, and the matter was settled by a duel between admirals. They held the fight on the abandoned island of <a href=\"/punk-hazard-island/4020-57935/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57935\">Punk Hazard</a>. Their battle lasted ten days, but Akainu was the victor. He took the position of fleet-admiral at the new <a href=\"/marineford-g-1-base/4020-58202/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58202\">Marineford</a>, previously the G-1 Base in the New World; then went back to using the name Sakazuki. Aokiji, Kuzan, left the Navy.</p><h3>Dressrosa Arc</h3><p>Sakazuki received word about an incident on Punk Hazard that had to do with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/don-quixote-doflamingo/4005-73343/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73343\">Don Quixote Doflamingo</a>, who had recently resigned from the Seven Warlords. This threatened to throw the balance of power in the New World into chaos. In response, Sakazuki ordered <a href=\"/fujitora/4005-88539/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88539\">Admiral Fujitora</a> to investigate <a href=\"/dressrosa/4020-58097/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58097\">Dressrosa</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Magma-Magma Fruit</h3><p>Sakazuki holds the power of one of the most powerful fire-type <a href=\"/devil-fruits/4055-57305/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57305\">devil fruits</a>, the Magma-Magma Fruit (マグマグの実, <em>Magu Magu no Mi</em>). As with most logia-types, this makes the user immune to most normal physical based attacked. Their body becomes the very element, and this makes Sakazuki a living volcano. The heat he can produce is hot enough to burn Portgas D, Ace, who had the powers of the Flame-Flame Fruit.</p><ul><li><b>Ryusei Kazan</b> (流星火山 <i>Ryūsei Kazan</i>, literally meaning \"Meteor Volcano\") -Akainu creates a great number of magma fists that he fires into the air in order to let them rain down upon the battlefield, causing enormous amounts of area damage</li><li><b>Inugami Guren</b> (犬噛紅蓮 <i>Inugami Guren</i>, literally meaning \"Dog-Bite Blaze\"): Arguably the source of Sakazuki's nickname, Akainu creates a wave of magma, shaped like a dog's head, and launches it against his opponent. It was first used against Whitebeard.</li><li><b>Dai Funka</b> (大噴火 <i>Dai Funka</i>, literally meaning \"Great Eruption\"): Akainu's signature technique, he transforms his fist into one made out of pure lava before throwing it forward, like an over-sized rocket.</li></ul><h3>Haki</h3><p><a href=\"/haki/4015-56190/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56190\">Haki </a>(覇気, Haki) is a power that is possessed by all people, but few can actually use it. It's often unique to those with a strong enough will to control. This power is even strong enough to cancel out the powers of Devil Fruit users, but even they can use this skill. There are three basic forms of Haki, and Sakazuki has only been seen to be able to use one.</p><ul><li><b>Armament Haki:</b> The Armament Haki (武装色, Busoushoku) technique is a skill that surrounded the body of the user like an invisible armor. This can also be projected outward when striking to cause even more damage than normal. This power can even completely cancel the abilities of the powerful Logia Devil Fruit users. Sakazuki has used this to deflect an attack of Whitebeard.</li></ul><h2>Weaknesses</h2><h3>Sea Water</h3><p>All devil fruit users share one similar weakness. That is the ocean. The incredible power of the devil fruit renders the user a complete inability to swim. Once in water, they will sink like a stone. In sea water, a devil fruit user will also lose all strength in in their body.</p><h3>Extreme Cold</h3><p>Though most logia-types are nearly invulnerable, they can still be overcome by a more powerful force of the same kind, or their natural opposing element. Holding the power of the hottest of the fire-types mean he can't be overcome in heat. However, his natural enemy would be extreme cold.

    "description": "<h2>Early Years</h2><p>James is only seen as a toddler or small child during Batman's early year tales such as <i>Batman: Year One</i> and <i>Batman: the Long Halloween</i>. He is said to be currently living with his <a href=\"/barbara-kean-gordon/4005-70561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70561\">mother</a> in <a href=\"/chicago-illinois/4020-55728/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55728\">Chicago</a>.</p><h2>Skeleton Cases</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1585201-screen_capture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1585201\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.72602739726027\" data-width=\"511\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 511px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1585201-screen_capture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1585201\"><img alt=\"Back in Gotham\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/66303/1585201-screen_capture_1.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/1585201-screen_capture_1.png 511w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/1585201-screen_capture_1.png 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/66303/1585201-screen_capture_1.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Back in Gotham</figcaption></figure><p>Gordon gets a phone call from <a href=\"/harvey-bullock/4005-5554/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5554\">Harvey Bullock</a> telling him to go to the <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a> Aviary. When Gordon arrives, Bullock informs Jim that the aviary cages are all automated from the control room and there is some troubling video footage from the security cameras that Jim needs to see. Gordon sees the image of a man who resembles his son James Jr.</p><p>Later on that same day, Gordon invites Oracle for some coffee and talks to her about his findings. Oracle still sticks by her story and she leaves her father with lingering doubts but then James Jr. appears from other side of the cafe. James Jr. sits down with his father and explains his return to Gotham. James Jr. begins by apologizing to his father for the theatrics at the aviary. James tells the commissioner that his mother (Barbara Sr.) sent him to <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum</a> for a psychological evaluation and the doctors clinically diagnosed him as mentally unstable in regards to exhibiting apathetic behavior. However, the doctors prescribed an experimental medicine to help James in stabilizing his emotional imbalance.</p><p>James also knows how his sister feels about him and he swears to his father that he has never killed anybody. Gordon still doesn't know what to think about his son until James informs him about his volunteer work at <a href=\"/leslie-thompkins/4005-3740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3740\">Dr. Thompkins</a>' clinic. James Jr. leaves the cafe and asks that his father will hopefully find it in his heart to forgive him.</p><p>This conversation causes Gordon to remember and wonder about his son’s innocence and what exactly happened to the young girl, Bess who was one of Babs' friends. Oracle has always been under the assumption that James Jr. murdered her friend because she saw James Jr. playing with her friend’s key to a science set they had bought together. Gordon has heard this story from Babs before but he doesn't want to believe that his son is a killer without enough proof.</p><p>Gordon later starts to think about a case that has haunted him for a long time. Fifteen years ago, Gordon was moving up the ranks within the precinct when he started investigating a string of eight murders that involved the Peter Pan Killer who would sneak into family homes and abduct children from their beds then murder them. Gordon never caught him.</p><p>Now after 15 years, Gordon trails a criminal who has just been relased from <a href=\"/blackgate-penitentiary/4020-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56051\">Blackgate</a> and who he suspects is the Peter Pan Killer. He confronts the killer and the killer reveals that he was going to abduct James Jr., at the Gordon's summer house, but when he confronted the boy, James Jr. simply turned around and told the killer that he knew exactly who he was. This leads Gordon to believe that the dissappearance of Bess was the Peter Pan Killer's doing, because the event the killer described occured on the same day Bess disapeared. This greatly eases Gordon's mind but he still has his doubts so he asks Dick to meet whith James Jr. and see if he had really changed.</p><p>Dick meets with him and James seems calm and friendy. Durring his conversation, James says how he is going to see an old friend that they both knew, later that day. Dick is then called away due to a breakthrough in his case. It is then revealed that Jame's meeting with his friend is him dismembering and torturing hin in his own basement.</p><p>Gordon, still suspicious of his son, goes to the clinic where James Jr. is volenteering at and asks, Leslie, James Jr.'s superviser about him. Leslie tells Gordon that he is the model volenteer and that he even volenteered to start making nutrition runs for the clinic. James soon walks in and he thanks his father for stopping by.</p><p>Gordon asks to meet with Barbara and he gives <a href=\"/barbara-gordon/4005-5368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Barbara</a> a pill that he took from James' office and asks her to run a couple of tests. Barbara knew something was going on with James but she didn't want to rub in her father's face because she could see that Gordon still wanted to hold onto any hope of saving his son. Barbara figures the medicine is supposed to help James in treating or possibly curing his psychotic tendencies but Diaxemene is still in the testing phases and hasn't been approved by the FDA. Gordon is hoping he can convince James to undergo some blood work in order to make sure that he has been taking his pills.</p><p>Barbara breaks down the pill's components and she makes a startling discovery. James has reversed the effect of the pill and now the pill is designed to chemically induce apathy rather than empathy in a certain section of the brain. However, the dosage of James' pill is of such low grade that it wouldn't affect an adult. Barbara relays all of her findings to her father. Gordon can't understand why James would concoct a pill with such a low dosage then it hits him. Leslie made James responsible for the \"nutrition runs\" at her clinic. James has been or is going to start putting his pills in the baby formula and giving it to all the newborns thereby ensuring their development into becoming psychopaths.</p><p>Gordon reaches the clinic and bursts into his son's office to find he isn't there. Gordon does notice a box in the closet and when he opens it he finds the key that Bess had before she disappeared as well as countless other house keys, presumably taken as trophies. Bullock then finds Gordon and tells him the terrible news that the Joker has escaped from Arkham. Gordon immediatly gets in his car and drives to the hotel the Barbara Sr. is staying at. While he is on his way he calls her and warns her about the Joker, durring the call she hears a knock at the door and answers it. through the phone Gordon hears a crash and insane laughter as his ex-wife begs for mercy. Gordon reaches the hotel and bursts into his ex's room and goes into the bathroom. Gordon can only cry the word no, because he has found his beloved ex-wife nude in the bath tub with a crimson smile across her face.</p><p>Gordon rushes Barbara to the lab at Wayne Enterprises and he tells his daughter what has occured. Oracle reacts by calling <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick</a> and having him meet her father at the lab. Oracle runs a few tests on her mother while Dick injects the anti-Joker Venom. Fortunately, Gordon got to Barbara just in time to save her and the <a href=\"/joker-venom/4015-50669/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50669\">Joker Venom</a> was a derivative of the original. Gordon at this point wants Joker's head on a pike for all the misery he has brought to the Gordons' but Dick convinces Gordon that there is no way the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a> could have escaped Arkham and found out where Barbara was so quickly. Dick promises Gordon that he will find Joker and make him talk.</p><p>Dick heads to Arkham and conducts a complete sweep of the crime scene. From what Dick could deduce, Joker didn't get very far from Arkham because Dick begins follow a trail of Joker's sweat which seems to be secreting Joker Venom. Dick follows the trail to an abandoned section of Arkham. At this point, Dick figures that Joker must have discovered <a href=\"/mr-zsasz/4005-25091/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25091\">Victor Zsasz'</a>s underground path which leads to the catacombs beneath Arkham. Zsasz used this path to escape Arkham so he could freely kill anyone he wanted in Gotham then he would make his way back to Arkham as if he had never escaped at all.</p><p>Dick finds Joker in a dank corner of the catacombs. He notices Joker mumbling to himself about being disappointed. Dick apprehends Joker and begins to interrogate him. Joker starts off by complaining about the fact that Dick isn't the real Batman by saying \"You don't scare me little bird” and he isn't saying a word until the real Batman returns. Dick decides to beat down on the Joker until he reveals who he hired to attack Barbara Gordon. Joker laughs hysterically because according to him, the real Batman would have figured out that the Joker does his own dirty work and he would never send some errand boy to take credit for his fun. Dick finally realizes that the Joker was able to escape simply because someone needed him to be the scapegoat for the attack on Barbara Gordon and they were counting on Commissioner Gordon to retaliate by ending the Joker once and for all.</p><p>Back at the lab, Gordon sat by Barbara's side as Bullock escorted Oracle back to her apartment. Barbara eventually wakes up and when she laid her eyes on Gordon, she immediately began to scream for help. A doctor comes rushing and injects a sedative into Barbara. Gordon finally realizes that James injected the Joker Venom into his mother as a way to get back at her for institutionalizing him while at the same time he wanted Gordon to think the Joker was responsible for the attack on Barbara in order to bait him into killing the Joker. If Gordon knows how calculating his son can be then he would guess that James has already realized his plan to manipulate everything is falling apart which leaves only one person left for him to torture...Oracle.</p><p>Bullock drops Oracle off at her apartment doorstep and just as she entered her apartment, James closes the door right behind her. James and Oracle enter a discussion about on how depraved he is. James respects Oracle because she is the only one who can see him for what he is. Barbara replies to his compliment with a scoff. Oracle always knew James was disturbed and most of those people that he has already killed were actually victims rather people who had it coming. In short, Oracle realizes that James tries to find flaws or start something with another person just so he can justify as well as satisfy his violent tendencies. James smiles and his respect for Oracle's deduction has reached new lengths.</p><h3>The New 52</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109023/2325103-2290380_jamie.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2325103\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8859375\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109023/2325103-2290380_jamie.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2325103\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109023/2325103-2290380_jamie.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109023/2325103-2290380_jamie.png 1280w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/109023/2325103-2290380_jamie.png 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/109023/2325103-2290380_jamie.png 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109023/2325103-2290380_jamie.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>James later reappears after the events of <a href=\"/flashpoint/4045-56280/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56280\">Flashpoint</a>, and is shown encountering Barbara's friend <a href=\"/alysia-yeoh/4005-79940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79940\">Alysia</a>.

However, James shows up threatening the Joker to release Batgirl or he will detonate to hand-held grenades. he also says that he has rescued his mother from the nail bomb in the skating rink. This allows Batgirl to take down Joker's henchmen. James then betrays Batgirl by trading her life for his mother's who was inf act never rescued.</p><p>After torturing Batgirl from afar, he meets up with his mother at the Gotham Bay Aquarium, the last place she saw her son smile. Batgirl interferes, just when James is about to shoot his mother. James tells his mother that Batgirl his in fact Barbara Gordon, her daughter. But she already new, she says, and shoots her son herself. Wounded, James escapes but is apprehended by Batgirl. James is giving Batgirl a concussion by hitting her in the head with a club. Dizzy, Batgirl defeats her brother. James then confesses why he does what he does. He tells them how she was always the favorite, \"Perfect Barbara. Brilliant Barbara\". And then it happens. Just as James is about to kill his mother with a knife, Batgirl throws a batarang straight into James' left eye, making him fall down in the water. The body was never found, which suggest that he might've survived.</p><h4>The Court of Owls</h4><p><b>For more information see : <a href=\"/a-court-of-owls/4045-56683/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56683\">A Court of Owls</a></b></p><p>While <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> investigates Dan Matthews, a guard at <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum</a> who maybe on the take, Dan in a desperate attempt to get away, opens several of the inmates cells.

A group who plotted to kill Diana while she was still an infant.</p><p>After spending years in prison she was freed by Captain Nazi during an attack on Themyscira. Upon being set free she once again attempted to kill Diana. Eventually the Circle was defeated by Hippolyta and Diana.</p>",

But unlike most children he was born in silence, cloud did not cry or even speak until he was eight years old. He was thought to be with emotion, even when his father died Cloud did not cry and his mother began to hate him, for how could she love a child that had no emotion to others. Soon he became alienated from those around him and he welcomes the solitude that comes with it, His mother even left to alone and only provided him with food and nothing else, no words of comfort or touch, she even made him eat alone.   </p> <p>Much later Cloud would learn what love was as his mother remarries Fok Bou Tin, Fok treats Cloud like he was his own son and Cloud starts to escape his solitude. His Stepfather teaches him the family art of sword play. Finally happy with his life the young cloud was proud to be a member of the Fok clan and then one day it all changed when Fok insults <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70605\" href=\"/hung-ba/4005-70605/\">Hung Ba</a> the leader of one of the most powerful martial arts sects. Hung sends his assassins to kill the family and as the attack takes place Cloud hides and watches as his loved ones are cut down, again he has no tears to shed instead his heart fills with anger. But he is discovered and before he can be killed is saved by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70604\" href=\"/nameless/4005-70604/\">Nameless</a> the Mou Lam Legend.. Nameless tells cloud that he can not take him as a student as he has let anger into his heart. </p> <p>Cloud set out on his own and soon joins the very clan that had killed his family the Tin Ha Wui. Hung Ba takes him as one of his on students and teaches him the ways of Cloud Splitting Plam. This is all part of Clouds plan to become stronger so he can finally kill Hung Ba when he has enough strength to face his master. </p> <h2>The Tin Ha Wui</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3437/1200056-storm_rider_clash6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1200056\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3437/1200056-storm_rider_clash6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1200056\"><img alt=\"Cloud And Wind\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3437/1200056-storm_rider_clash6.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3437/1200056-storm_rider_clash6.jpg 1024w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3437/1200056-storm_rider_clash6.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3437/1200056-storm_rider_clash6.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Cloud And Wind</figcaption></figure><p>Over the years Cloud becomes the most favoured student of Hung Ba and is one of the greatest fighters with in the clan. With every mission he is sent on, he returns stronger and has never failed Hung Ba. The emotionless young child had grown into a even deadlier enemy, even helping Hung Ba to destroy all of his enemies and is one of the key elements why Tin Ha Wui grows to such power. </p> <p> Even with all the anger in his heart Cloud finds peace in one of Hung Ba’s servants known as Charity. But this soon brings him into to conflict when she marries Frost and he swears he will never give up on her and the two start an affair. One that Wind does not take lightly warning Cloud that it is wrong and should be stopped, the two start a feud, which much of the story forums off. Cloud challenges Wind to a fight knowing that he is more powerful then his counter part. Wind decide to fight him and Cloud soon gains the upper hand and almost kills Wind but Charity jumps in and protects Wind with her own body. Charity is killed by Clouds attack and as she dies tells how Wind is her true love. Refusing to belive her last words Cloud takes her body and becomes an outcast from Tin Ha Wui, Cloud finally lays Charity to rest in an imperial tomb and leaves to continue down his dark path. </p> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3437/1200055-ppos0498.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1200055\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.45\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3437/1200055-ppos0498.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1200055\"><img alt=\"Nameless\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" data-width=\"140\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3437/1200055-ppos0498.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3437/1200055-ppos0498.jpg 140w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nameless\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3437/1200055-ppos0498.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3437/1200055-ppos0498.jpg 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" data-width=\"140\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nameless</figcaption></figure><p>During his journey Cloud is faced with the Sword Saint and kills him, but Cloud learns the mans skills and returns o Tin Ha Wui and seeks his revenge on Hung Ba for killing his family.

    "description": "<h2>Publication History</h2>In 2009, Axel Baines was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-6536\" href=\"/keith-giffen/4040-6536/\" slug=\"keith-giffen\"> Keith Giffen</a> as one of the supporting characters in the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-28062\" href=\"/magog/4050-28062/\" slug=\"magog\"> Magog</a> ongoing series. Axel was the foremost of these supporting characters and has appeared in every issue thus far. <br/><h2>History  </h2>With whatever name Axel Baines was originally known by, he served in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-44416\" href=\"/us-marine-corps/4060-44416/\" slug=\"us-marine-corps\"> United States Marine Corps</a>, and it was during that time he became a friend of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41481\" href=\"/magog/4005-41481/\" slug=\"magog\"> David Reid</a>. The military life apparently did not suit him, because he went out of his way to get a section eight discharge. He did this by insisting to psychiatrists that he was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" slug=\"batman\"> Batman</a> with such zeal and determination they had to believe he was crazy. <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229358-axelbaines06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1229358\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.65\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229358-axelbaines06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1229358\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1229358-axelbaines06.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229358-axelbaines06.jpg 600w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1229358-axelbaines06.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure>     Once out of the corps, he set himself up as an independent operator under the new identity of Axel Baines, slipping into the comfortable facade of a southern good ol' boy running a tiny gas station in Ordell, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56569\" href=\"/west-virginia/4020-56569/\" slug=\"west-virginia\"> West Virginia</a>. He dealt in information, using a sophisticated search engine he created called Mirage. This was his life when David Reid, who had recently become Magog, looked him up. <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229356-axelbaines04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1229356\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.255\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229356-axelbaines04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1229356\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229356-axelbaines04.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229356-axelbaines04.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a></figure>     Magog was looking to act independently of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\" href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" slug=\"justice-society-of-america\"> Justice Society of America</a>, but doing so required him to have his own resource when it came to gathering intelligence. Axel was more than up to meeting the requirement, pointing Magog to hotspots and finding answers to the questions Magog returned with. When Magog later found himself kicked out of the Justice Society, Axel became the hero's only resource. He helped Magog also get set up living in Ordell with a house that was somewhat of a fixer-upper. <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229355-axelbaines03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1229355\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.1085714285714\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:210.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229355-axelbaines03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1229355\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-width=\"350\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229355-axelbaines03.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229355-axelbaines03.jpg 350w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229355-axelbaines03.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1229355-axelbaines03.jpg 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-width=\"350\"></noscript></a></figure>     One of the biggest questions Magog came to Axel with was also the most surprising. They needed answers about who Magog was, because beings were showing up claiming to be relations of him. They were claiming ties to Magog and not David Reid, and up until this point, neither David or Axel had reason to make a distinction between the two. This mystery began for Axel with a violent encounter with Magog's alleged mother Alba in his gas station. Entering into Mirage some of the keywords said to him as Alba was throwing him around, he found some scraps of a legend of thirty-three wicked sisters that tied into Magog's true origins. <br/> <br/><h2>Abilities and Skills</h2>Axel behaves like lazy, uneducated guy with no cares beyond the walls of his gas station. The truth is that Axel is a trained Marine, intelligence operative and computer genius. He created a search engine, Mirage, that is possibly on par with programs utilized by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\" href=\"/oracle/4005-5368/\" slug=\"oracle\"> Oracle</a>.",

He came with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2363\" href=\"/orion/4005-2363/\" slug=\"orion\">             Orion </a>to help the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">        JLA </a>face off against  <br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-11277\" href=\"/mageddon/4005-11277/\" slug=\"mageddon\">Mageddon</a>. He didn't do much until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23237\" href=\"/general-eiling/4005-23237/\" slug=\"general-eiling\">  General Eiling</a>'s attack on the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41469\" href=\"/justice-league-watchtower/4020-41469/\" slug=\"justice-league-watchtower\">          JLA headquarters</a>. He attacked Eiling on Orion's orders, but could beat the eternally regenerating villain. Eventually Sturmer managed to push Eiling into the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\" href=\"/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\" slug=\"phantom-zone\">       Phantom Zone</a>, sending himself along in the process. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">      Superman </a>attempted to save Sturmer, but Orion convinced him not to, explaining that Sturmer volunteered, and was prepared to die saving Earth. He is presumed dead.  <br/> <br/><b>Powers</b>: Sturmer was a very large <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40647\" href=\"/new-gods/4060-40647/\" slug=\"new-gods\">     New God </a>dog and as such he was incredibly strong. He was even able to face off against General Eiling.  <br/> <br/><b>Intelligence</b>: There is a little question as to Sturmer's intelligence, he apparently volunteered to help save Earth and is very heroic. But he also was never shown talking and seemed only to obey simple commands, such as when Orion told him to attack Eiling by simply saying \"Sturmer, Kill\" Orion also commented to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\" href=\"/aquaman/4005-2357/\" slug=\"aquaman\">    Aquaman </a>that Sturmer bites.</p>",

He supplied Ral-Dar with a weapon that could effectively put down Zod. Al thought the attempt against Zod's life failed and only severely wounded him. Still not knowing that fact, Lane harbored the Kryptonian fugitive as he was being pursued by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\" href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" slug=\"supergirl\">Supergirl</a>. But the alliance between the renegade Kryptonian and Lane was short-lived. Ral-Dar heard a conversation between Lane and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28129\" href=\"/atlas/4005-28129/\" slug=\"atlas\">Atlas</a>, where the general made clear that Ral-Dar was nothing but a puppet in Lane's master plan. The Kryptonian realized that  he had shaken hands with the devil and Lane was as a tyrant as Zod. Furious, he broke out from his cell but Lane just cracked a smile as this was part of his plan. <br/> <br/>Ral-Dar knew that  President Martin Suarez was heading to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55845\" href=\"/markovia/4020-55845/\" slug=\"markovia\">Markovia</a>, apparently to sign a commerce treaty. But he was sure that the United States was going to make a deal to declare war against <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56084\" href=\"/new-krypton/4020-56084/\" slug=\"new-krypton\">Krypton</a>. Sadly for him, he was intercepted by Superman who ordered him to stop his irrational attack. But Ral-Dar had little time to convince him otherwise. The two Kryptonians were surrounded by Lane's army and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45866\" href=\"/squad-k/4060-45866/\" slug=\"squad-k\">Squad K</a>. Superman was shocked not only by Lane's presence (he was supposed to be dead after the events of <b><a data-ref-id=\"4045-40778\" href=\"/our-worlds-at-war/4045-40778/\" slug=\"our-worlds-at-war\">Our Worlds at War</a></b>) but also with the fact that Ral-Dar was already familiar with Lane. Without more explanations, Squad K and the army opened fire with anti-Kryptonian weapons, ending with Ral-Dar's life although Supeman remained unharmed.  <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/1202962-002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202962\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1196172248804\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/1202962-002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202962\"><img alt=\" Superman holding Ral-Dar's body\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9241/1202962-002.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/1202962-002.jpg 627w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9241/1202962-002.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Superman holding Ral-Dar's body\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9241/1202962-002.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/1202962-002.jpg 627w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9241/1202962-002.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Superman holding Ral-Dar's body</figcaption></figure>     Superman didn't have more time to ask for explanations as he received an urgent call from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31100\" href=\"/alura/4005-31100/\" slug=\"alura\">Alura</a>.

    "deck": "William Nguyen was once the vastly powerful Captain Universe. Instead of using his granted powers for good, he attempted to kill the Juggernaut for previously ruining his life.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>William Nguyen had everything a man could ever want; a well paying job at a financial firm called Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and (the last name was never revealed), a loving and caring girlfriend and a comfortable home and then, one day, while <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut</a> was trying to ditch <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>, he came crashing through Williams office building and caused a great deal of damage to the structure.</p><p>Because of this, the company William worked for had to lay off a numerous amount of employees including William himself until they could get back on their feet again. Even though his boss assured him that things would get better, they didn't. Slowly but surely his entire life began to unravel. His girlfriend dumped him, he was forced to work menial jobs for minimum pay just to stay alive, ended up being robbed on two different occasions and eventually lost his apartment due to his inability to pay the rent, thus forcing him out onto the streets alone and overwhelmed with despair.</p><p>Having completely given up on life, William attempted commit suicide by jumping off of a bridge tower overlooking the east river, but just when he started having second thoughts William slipped on the rain-soaked surface of the bridge tower and lost his footing. In that one single moment, William prayed for forgiveness, The <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-enigma-force/4060-57600/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57600\">Enigma Force</a> heard these prayers and sent the<a href=\"/uni-power/4015-44362/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44362\"> Uni-Power</a> to him, turning William into the new <a href=\"/captain-universe/4005-27193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27193\">Captain Universe</a>. As The Uni-Power coursed through his body he realized that with it at his disposal he could bring balance to the world and right all wrongs, William decided that he would start this \"noble mission\" by slaying Juggernaut.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>William Nguyen was created by <a href=\"/roger-stern/4040-41502/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41502\">Roger Stern</a> and <a href=\"/lee-weeks/4040-3252/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3252\">Lee Weeks</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-amazing-spider-man/4050-2127/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2127\"><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i></a> #627.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Nyugen hasn't appeared since the story which introduced him and a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/tamara-devoux/4005-88135/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88135\">subsequent Captain Universe</a> has been introduced.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Something Can Stop the Juggernaut</h3><p>It only took a day for William to track down Juggernaut, whom he took by surprise, brought up into space, shredded his helmet and used his new psychic powers to rend Juggernaut's mind asunder. Then, William tossed Juggernaut back to Earth for all the world to see his defeat.</p><p>After having presumably killed Juggernaut and realizing that the Uni-Power wasn't going anywhere for a while, William began using his powers to deal with small things such as leaving a drunk driver hanging out to dry on top of the arch in Washington Square. But then, when he learned that Juggernaut had survived their fight, William stormed the Inwood Armory where Juggernaut was being held and was confronted by Spider-Man, who desperately tried to convince him not to kill The Juggernaut.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2719368-amazing_spider_man__628___page_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719368\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5182186234818\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2719368-amazing_spider_man__628___page_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719368\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man vs. Captain Universe\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2719368-amazing_spider_man__628___page_3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2719368-amazing_spider_man__628___page_3.jpg 988w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2719368-amazing_spider_man__628___page_3.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2719368-amazing_spider_man__628___page_3.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\"></a><figcaption>Spider-Man vs. Captain Universe</figcaption></figure><p>William ignored Spider-Man's pleas and tore the table that the unconscious Juggernaut had been bound to out of the ground along with a huge chunk of dirt and concrete. Not caring that Spider-Man was standing on the table, William hurled both it and Juggernaut far across the city, past the Hudson and into The Jersey Palisades. He arrived shortly after the crash and found that Juggernaut had proved to be even sturdier than the table and had barely suffered any injury from slamming directly into the Palisades.</p><p>As Williams focus turned away from Juggernaut and towards the whereabouts of Spider-Man, William found himself being webbed in the face and jumped on by Spider-Man, causing William to fly from the Palisades and back towards Manhattan at blazing speeds, hoping that he could shake off the wall-crawler.</p><p>After finding themselves above Lower Manhattan, William used a full-body energy release to throw Spider-Man off-guard, but quickly realized afterwards that Spider-Man was no longer holding onto him. Taking a few moments to scan the area, William found Spider-Man clinging to the underbelly of a news-chopper and as he bounded towards him was once again webbed in the face, distracting him just long enough for Spider-Man to leap off the chopper and swing down into Manhattan.</p><p>After regaining his bearings, William pursued Spider-Man through the city and finally caught up with him and sent both of them flying straight through the walls of the Pier 60 Health Club, where Spider-Man managed to catch him off-guard once more by tossing a towel over his face. Enraged, William ripped the towel off of his face and, with help from the frightened club members, found Spider-Man and began pursuing him once more. The chase eventually ended at a demolition site, where Spider-Man webbed Captain Universe down once more in order to gain his attention and get him to talk in hopes of ending this madness. Before Spider-Man could get anywhere, the ground began to shake violently, which prompted William to go and investigate, but not before wrapping a metal beam around Spider-Man's body and pinning it into the ground so that he would stay put so that William could deal with Spider-Man after his investigation was over.</p><p>As William ventured deep into the Earth, the Uni-Power spoke to him and tried directing his focus on fulfilling his true destiny, which was to fix dozens of giant fractures beneath the Earth but failed to keep his attention for long when Juggernaut arrived to rescue Spider-Man.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2719373-amazing_spider_man__629___page_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719373\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5182186234818\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2719373-amazing_spider_man__629___page_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719373\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2719373-amazing_spider_man__629___page_5.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2719373-amazing_spider_man__629___page_5.jpg 988w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2719373-amazing_spider_man__629___page_5.jpg 960w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2719373-amazing_spider_man__629___page_5.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\"></a></figure><p>William quickly returned to the surface where he planned to finish Juggernaut off, but when Spider-Man distracted William once more by webbing his fist up, Juggernaut grabbed Nguyen and punched him in the stomach as hard as possible, which did not seem to have any real effect on Nguyen. Spider-Man then stepped in himself and started trying to convince Juggernaut not to kill William as they needed him to avert a crisis they themselves did not have the power to halt. This gave William more than enough time to take both men by surprise and trap them within an alternate dimension of his own making.</p><p>There, within that other reality, William told the tale of his tragic downfall, a tale which Juggernaut contested with his own tale about the events following the day his rampage through New York came to an end. William did not care for Juggernaut's plight as he had always had the power to survive whereas William himself did not. William then recalled the events surrounding the mystery of how he had beaten Juggernaut the first time around. This enraged Juggernaut even further and compelled him to challenge William to a \"real\" fight. William accepted the challenge, but Spider-Man stood in their way, hoping that he could reason with the two and end the fighting.</p><p>It was then that the fractures beneath the Earth started to unleash their fury, causing massive shock-waves to rock the whole of Manhattan to it's very core. Realizing that William did not fix the fractures, Spider-Man demanded that he go and complete his duty as Captain Universe. William, however, had decided that killing Juggernaut was more important than saving millions of innocent lives from total annihilation. This act of selfishness greatly offended The Enigma Force, who stripped William of The Uni-Power and transferred it over to Juggernaut. Juggernaut then encased both William and Spider-Man inside an energy field while he went to go deal with the fractures. When he returned, Juggernaut grabbed a hold of William and prepared to grind him into dust for what he had done and what he had refused to do.</p><p>Having realized that Juggernaut was now the hero and he was the villain, William fell back into a state of pure despair and demanded that Juggernaut end his miserable and worthless life. Spider-Man asked him not to and after Juggernaut mulled it over, he let William go and apologized for all of the pain his actions had caused William. The Enigma Force then departed from Juggernaut's body and left to find its next host, Juggernaut himself departed from the scene shortly after and Spider-Man turned William over to the police.</p><p>However, with the help of his attorney, <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Matt Murdock</a>, William was cleared of all charges for the damage he caused during his time as Captain Universe. William was last seen talking on a show called PM New York about his new book \"I survived The Juggernaut\" which had already become the number one hit on Amazon.com. William talked about his trial and about using most of his money to set up a foundation that would help those who are suffering like he once did get back up on their feet.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As Captain Universe, Nguyen's powers are virtually limitless and are only hindered by his own lack of imagination. As displayed, he possesses superhuman strength and speed and can will himself to fly. He also possesses the ability to fire concussive bursts of energy from his hands.He can control molecules of organic and inorganic matter and can transmute elements. Nguyen also used the Uni-Power to create an entire reality.</p>",

He was given the ability to move at superhuman speed bt scientists serving the Third Reich.</p><p>He first recorded mission was in 1942.

It was to be used in an experiment during an electrical storm. The experiment was almost finished when Liberty Belle, Johnny Quick, and the original Flash soon approached them. Lightning struck the bell while Liberty Belle was holding onto one of Blitzkrieg's machines and produced vibrations. These vibrations gave Liberty Belle the ability to produce sonic pulses. She used the sonic pulses to hurl Blitzkrieg and Zyklon toward the arriving Flash and Johnny Quick. Blitzkrieg and Zyklon soon escaped.</p><p>Zyklon's whereabouts, further exploits, and career are yet to be recorded.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br /></h2><p>When Dracula was accidentally revived from death by the carelessness of Clifton Graves, he was immediately hounded by the trio of Vampire Hunters, Rachel Van Helsing, Taj Nital, and Frank Drake. Together they pursued Dracula across  , from his Transylvanian castle to  .  <br /> <br />When the Hunters caught up with Dracula, he attempted to escape to another dimension through a sinister occult mirror. Taj grabbed his foe as he passed halfway through the portal, and the two were transported to a demon infested hell. There Dracula knocked out Taj, but saved him from being consumed by the demons, reasoning that Dracula might need to feed on his enemy if they could not find a way out.  <br /> <br />Eventually Dracula discovered another portal that transported them back in time to the late nineteenth century  , shortly after Abraham Van Helsing had \"killed” the Vampire Lord. Dracula imprisoned his unconscious foe in a marble coffin and began planning his revenge on Van Helsing.  Meanwhile in the present century, Rachel and Frank unlocked the mirrors secrets and followed their enemy back in time in the hopes of rescuing Taj. <br /> <br />Dracula soon learned of their arrival in the 19th century and plotted to kill the hunters before they could stop him from taking his revenge. Back in his castle, Dracula found a glass decanter filled with blood. The decanter held the essence of the lethal vampire, Lenore. Years ago, Dracula imprisoned her in this bottle for unspecified reasons. In need of an ally, Dracula smashed the glass bottle against the castle's stone wall. The two vampires then flew from the castle to hunt the Transylvanian hills for their next victims. Dracula ordered Lenore to kill the hunters, while he planned to lie in wait for Abraham Van Helsing. Lenore caught up with Frank and Rachel at the castle's graveyard, moments after they found Taj. Lenore attacked Rachel and was poised to kill her, but Frank and Taj drove her off by casting the shadow of a cross shaped headstone on the vampire.  With his plan to kill Van Helsing foiled, Dracula grabbed Lenore and escaped back to the present day through the mystic mirror. <br />  <br />Dracula returned to modern day  and attacked and killed a servant girl of the Derings, an aristocratic family who lived in seclusion out on the moors. Inspectors from Scotland Yards reported the attack to the Vampire Hunters who later tracked Dracula and Lenore to an abandoned tomb near the Dering mansion. Rachel fired a wooden crossbow bolt straight at Dracula's heart, but the vampire grabbed Lenore and used her as a shield to protect him from harm. Dracula escaped death as the bolt pierced Lenore's heart, turning the she-devil to ash.       </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin<br/></h2><p>Randolph Dering is the deformed son of Lord Edwin and Lady Mary Dering of England.  Randolph suffers from two recessive genetic disorders that appear every few generations in  the Dering bloodline. Randolph's first condition, Rachitis, caused his body to be severely misshapen; giving him elongated limbs, a deformed face, and a hunchback. His second condition, Naevus Pilosis, caused him to grow excessive hair all over his body.  As a result, Randolph looked less like a human and more like a shaggy deformed creature similar to Bigfoot or the Himalayan Yeti.  <br/>  <br/>Embarrassed by their son's condition, Lord and Lady Dering hid Randolph out on the moors in an abandoned chapel on the outskirts of their grounds. They sent a serving girl from the manor to bring him food each day but otherwise left Randolph to grow up alone, secluded from the rest of the world.  Despite his parent’s cruelty, Randolph lived a quite gentle life on the moors. Unfortunately, his monstrous appearance sparked tales of a \"Moorland Monster\" amongst the frightened and ignorant villagers.   <br/></p><h2>Mayor Story<br/></h2><h3>Against Dracula<br/></h3><p>While on the run from the vampire hunters Rachel Van Helsing, Taj Nital, and Frank Drake, Dracula, Lord of the Vampires, found himself out on the moors Randolph called home. There, Dracula attacked and fed upon the serving girl who brought Randolph his food. Randolph soon found the young girl's body and carried her back to his chapel home. Meanwhile, Dracula's fellow vampire Lenore stalked and killed a young man in the nearby village. <br/> <br/>The villagers first impression was to blame the Moorland Monster for these deaths, and although it quickly became clear that Dracula was to blame, the thought of Randolph being the killer scared Lord Dering enough to disclose his family secret to the trio of vampire hunters. <br/></p> <p>The heroes tracked Dracula through the moors, to an abandoned castle. Dracula ambushed the group and quickly knocked out Taj. The vampire then turned his attention to Frank and Rachel, and after over-powering them, he entombed them in a dungeon-like pit, sealing it  with a massive metal plate. There was little hope for their survival since the plate could only be moved by someone who possessed Dracula's inhuman strength.  <br/><br/>Believing that they would starve to death in this tomb, Frank and Rachel confessed their love and kissed for the first time. To their surprise, the massive plate opened to reveal Randolph, who lowered a rope down to them. Apparently Randolph's monstrous physique provided him with strength to rival even Dracula himself. As the two vampire hunter's thanked him, Randolph appreciated being treated like a man and not a monster.  When the party returned to the Dering mansion, Rachel chastised Lord and Lady Dering for treating their own son so hideously.    </p>",

He is all that Johnny is currently capable of producing, though Johnny is implied to have once been an artist of notable talent. It is probable that the character's name and thinness is based on Johnny's own exceptional gauntness, for which he references being taunted as a child. <br/><h2>Creation</h2>Happy Noodle Boy was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-44428\" href=\"/jhonen-vasquez/4040-44428/\" slug=\"jhonen-vasquez\">Jhonen Vasquez</a>. He was initially created because a friend of Vasquez's was constantly requesting gift strips, and so he made her a purposefully terrible one in the hope that she would no longer be interested in requesting strips.  <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Happy Noodle Boy </h3>In his comic-within-a-comic, which is also titled \"Happy Noodle Boy,\" Happy Noodle Boy undertakes a series of incredibly nonsensical and largely incoherent \"adventures\" that are generally just Happy Noodle Boy shouting nonsense at passersby.  ",
