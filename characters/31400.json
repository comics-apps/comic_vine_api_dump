    "description": "<p>Gregory Gideon was one of the wealthiest, most influential men on the planet. He valued money over everything, even ignoring his own wife and son.</p><p>When he attempted to buy out the three remaining financial companies he didn't own, they set him a challenge they believed impossible: destroy the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\" href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" slug=\"fantastic-four\">Fantastic Four</a>. Gideon accepted the challenge, using his employees and connections to trick <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\" href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" slug=\"thing\">The Thing</a> into thinking Reed Richards was a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\" href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" slug=\"skrulls\">Skrull</a> and make <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\" href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" slug=\"human-torch\">Johnny Storm</a> think his sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\" href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" slug=\"invisible-woman\">Sue</a> was under the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3799\" href=\"/puppet-master/4005-3799/\" slug=\"puppet-master\">Puppet Master's</a> control.</p><p>While the Four fought amongst themselves, Gideon set in motion the final phase of his plan: to boobytrap the FF's Time Platform into sending them into the past. Gideon's son Thomas overheard his father's plan, and raced to warn the heroes, inadvertantly falling into the trap himself. Fortunately, Thomas was brought back by an automatic failsafe after Reed shut off his lab's power. Realising that he had almost lost his son, Gideon gave himself up to the police, vowing never to put money over his family ever again.</p><p>Some time later, Gideon discovered he was dying. Donning a powered suit, he had <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6823\" href=\"/dragon-man/4005-6823/\" slug=\"dragon-man\">Dragon Man</a> capture Sue Storm, in a bid to force Reed Richards to cure him. It was Thomas once again who convinced his father to stop, and Gideon decided to spend what time he had left with his family.</p><p>While flying in a private jet, Gideon and his wife were killed when their jet was caught between Russian nuclear tests. Thomas survived, becoming <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24402\" href=\"/glorian/4005-24402/\" slug=\"glorian\">Glorian</a> soon after.</p>",

    "deck": "Shigure is a member of the Sohma family who transforms into the dog of the Chinese Zodiac whenever he is hugged.",
    "description": "<h2>Personality and background</h2><br/><br/>Shigure is laid-back and anything but solemn. He is a flirt, a tease, and often acts like a pervert. Akito once remarked, that, \"I thought you'd sleep with any woman.\" He likes to tease Tohru about going on a date with her, and also says he likes high school girls. As a writer of both romance novels and academic books, Shigure loves to drive his editor, Mitchan, insane. His most famous and well-celebrated pen name is Kiritani Noa (western order, Noa Kiritani), which he usually uses for his romance novels, as 'Summer-Colored Sigh,' which he showed to Saki Hanajima, Arisa Uotani and Kyo Sohma. They give very different reactions, Hanajima asks if a sequel will be coming out, while Uotani says it is unacceptable to write that 'smut' and Kyo comments that it's sick. Tohru thinks it's amazing that she knows an author. Usually, he makes the editor suicidal by telling her that he didn't write anything yet, though he is finished already.<br/><br/>Shigure's best friends are Hatori Sohma and Ayame Sohma. This trio has been friends since their childhood. Together their nickname is the Mabudachi Trio. While Ayame and Shigure get along very well, it's less certain how Hatori, who is always exasperated with them, became their friend.<br/><br/>Occasionally, Shigure shows that he has another side to himself. He can be surprisingly mature, thoughtful, and gives rather sage and insightful advice to Tohru, Kyo, Yuki, and other characters, acting like an actual \"adult\". Only in the manga is it revealed that he is also quite cunning and somewhat dark-humoured. It could be said that in some ways Shigure is the one who is most affected by the curse, being in love with Akito and at the same time considered beneath her. It is also speculated and revealed in the manga that, although he does feel brotherly affection for her, Shigure is actually using Tohru Honda to break the Sohma curse. This is not true in the anime. Shigure is normally seen in a traditional kimono. Occasionally when he does business, he wears western style cothing (a suit). Naturally Shigure wears either a gray robe or a navy kimono. In the house, he normally walks around bare-footed while everyone else wears socks. He has his specific reasons for doing so, since it is his house.<br/><br/>Along with such behaviors, it is evident in both the anime and the manga (although much more noticeable in the manga) that Shigure is extremely manipulative, and would, in reality, use anyone and anything to reach his goal. He also is spiteful, having slept with Ren Sohma, Akito's mother, to get back at Akito after she slept with Kureno.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Relationships</h2><br/><br/><h2>With Akito</h2><br/><br/>Shigure is in love with Akito Sohma in the manga. He has previously dated Mayuko Shiraki (Tohru, Yuki, Kyo, Uotani and Hanajima's classroom teacher), though nothing came of it and the relationship began probably because he pitied Mayuko's loneliness. He continues to antagonize her by appearing and interfering with her life with his machinations bringing her closer to Hatori Sohma, for whom she has strong feelings.<br/><br/>He is also noted for having a love affair with Ren Sohma, Akito Sohma's mother, on the basis that Akito had chosen Kureno Sohma over Shigure. Because of that incident, Shigure stated that he hated Kureno Sohma for having an affair with Akito. Akito, angry that he would have an affair with the person she hated most (her mother), kicked him out of the main house. In truth, it appears that Shigure actually loves Akito and has since they were both very young. His manipulations appear to be for the purpose of breaking the Jyūnishi curse, so that he can free Akito for himself; believing that the end of the curse will cause Akito to let go of the person her father wanted her to be and become her true self (just 'Akito', rather than 'God'). Shigure also states that he slept with Akito's mother, Ren, in part because she looked like what Akito could have been, if she had she been raised as a woman. In chapter 132, he confessed his feelings to Akito and kissed her.<br/><br/>In book 3, Shigure says he \"had a dream about the one I love,\" referring to Akito<br/><br/><h2>With Hatori and Ayame</h2><br/><br/>The Three make up the Mabudachi trio, and was fond of getting into trouble along with Ayame. He and Ayame like to pretend to they're lovers, which freaks out Kyo Sohma to no end. He is described by Hatori \"a jellyfish\", and Hatori often seems exasperated with Shigure's antics. Sometimes, Hatori announces his displeasure with Shigure's manipulativeness, warning Shigure he will \"one day push too hard.\"",

    "deck": "Yuki is the member of the Sohma Family who transforms into the rat of the Chinese Zodiac whenever he is hugged by the opposite sex.",
    "description": "<h2>Personality and background</h2><br/><br/>Yuki is depicted as an attractive, reserved, and accomplished young man with many admirers, but who finds being friendly difficult. As a young man possessed by the rat, the animal that according to legend was first to arrive at the initial zodiac banquet,[5] Yuki is talented at anything he tries (except cooking). However, when Yuki was young, Akito Sohma kept him isolated from the rest of the family and convinced him no one liked or needed him;[6] because of this emotional abuse, Yuki has low self-esteem and feels isolated.[7][8] He is known as \"Prince Yuki\" and \"Prince Charming\" at school, where despite his popularity he must avoid intimacy with girls lest they trigger his transformation into a rat.[9] He has a fan club headed by Motoko Minagawa that tries to \"protect\" him from other admirers, with the result that Yuki is further isolated.[10] Yuki, however, wishes that he could be with people as friends, rather than be admired from afar, and envies both Kyo Sohma's and Kakeru Manabe's easy ways with others.[11][12] He is touched when, faced with the prospect of having her memory of the Sohma family secret erased, Tohru Honda asks that he remain her friend,[9] which no one had asked him before.[13]<br/><br/>With Tohru's help Yuki is gradually able to \"open the lid\" on his feelings, and the summer after she begins living in Shigure's house, Yuki admits to himself that he loves her.[14] In volume 14, he realizes he does not see her as a woman the way Kyo does, but as a mother figure. This is possibly a result of his distant relationship with his real mother (see below). Eventually, he falls in love with fellow student council member Machi Kuragi, who accepts him completely (even Tohru saw him as a prince, while Machi did not; when another council member commented on his princehood, she replied that he was not at all like a prince, and walked away.) However, in the anime, Yuki's relationship with Tohru is defined to more romantic and portrays, like Kyo's, a relationship that sees Tohru as a potential romantic companion.<br/><br/>As a child, Yuki was traumatized by Akito Sohma, the leader of the Sohma family. When Yuki was younger, Akito used to have total control over him. She would tell him terrible things that he could never forget, like that he was the most hated member of the family, and that if it weren't for her, Yuki would have no reason to exist. These statements were seemingly confirmed by the behavior of the rest of the family: Hatsuharu proclaimed he hated Yuki (although he later comes to adore Yuki), despite the fact he had never met him before. His brother, Ayame Sohma, brushed off his cry for help, and Kyo always hated and blamed him. Everyone else in the zodiac did not speak with him, though that was probably not an intentional snub on their part. On top of being mentally abusive, Akito was often physically abusive as well, and sometimes would lock Yuki away inside a dark room to torment him. As a result of the combined abuse, Yuki has terribly low self-esteem, and suffers from self-hatred and an inferiority complex. Though his outward demeanor shows nothing of his childhood torture, Yuki reveals to Tohru that he does not care or appreciate who he is as his personality was shaped to please others and conform to society, which he incidentally excels at.<br/><br/>Yuki's worst enemy would be Kyo Sohma, the cat of the zodiac. Hatsuharu Sohma felt animosity towards Yuki during part of their childhood because of the story often told to Haru about the rat taking advantage of the stupid cow; this made Haru develop an inferiority complex towards his older cousin. However, after actually meeting Yuki face-to-face, Haru was able to see Yuki's extreme kindness and developed a deep admiration for him.<br/><br/>Yuki also feels a close connection with his cousin Kisa Sohma, as Kisa was teased because the children in her class thought she was different from others. Until Tohru Honda touched her heart, she didn't go to school and she couldn't speak, much like Yuki back when he was younger. Likewise Yuki, despite his popularity, rarely interacted with anyone on a personal level and was extremely private and introverted. Until he met Tohru, Yuki was afraid of becoming close to anyone because of an incident during his childhood when his secret was discovered by his friends during a game of tag, when Akito ordered Hatori Sohma to erase the children's memories, thus leaving Yuki alone and without friends. After meeting Tohru, Yuki started warming up to other people and becomes much more social, as well as accepting who he really is.<br/><br/>Yuki also appears to have respiratory problems, due to his weak bronchial tubes, and gets regular checkups from Hatori to monitor his condition. In his childhood these asthma attacks were apparently frequent, though they appear to be less so in the present. Still, he has to take extra precautions because he occasionally has attacks, which could cause him to transform in public. Throughout the manga, the attacks are less and less frequent.<br/><br/>After Kyo was freed from the curse, a series of events was triggered and the rest of the cursed Sohma family members became free. Yuki is the last Sohma member to be freed, noticing this as he was talking to Machi. The spirit of the zodiac took the rat spirit and thanked Yuki for keeping his promise for a long time. It is possible perhaps Yuki was the last one to be freed because he was the rat, the first of the Jyuunishi.<br/><br/><h2>Relationship with Tohru</h2><br/><br/>While in the manga, Yuki reveals feelings toward Tohru as those of love towards a mother, the anime focuses on the relationship in a more romantic light. Yuki is shown to have noticed what type of a person Tohru was before she actually came to live in Shigure's house. Yuki is startled at her innocence and ability to constantly love and be happy, and is quite overprotective of her. He holds great trust in Tohru who is able to awaken Yuki's desires to be himself and helps him admit his inner insecurities. Although Tohru is able to understand Yuki to a great depth and shares mutual feelings of happiness and security around him, she also perceives his dual identity as a prince (though she doesn't confuse both sides). At the end of the anime, Yuki realizes how Tohru is precious to all the zodiac members and is necessary for Kyo's curse to be broken and helps her to reach out to him; however there is no definite conclusion in the end as to what happens in the future for either.<br/><br/>While reminiscing in Volume 15, it is revealed that Yuki had first met Tohru as a young girl. He had run away from the Sohma House, and eventually got lost. While continuing his walk, he saw Kyoko Honda surrounded by policemen and at first sight looked like she was crying. Yuki hid behind a pole and watched as Kyoko began to scream out the description of her daughter as an \"adorable little girl with an adorable dress and adorable-looking pom-poms in her hair.\" Kyoko said that if she didn't find Tohru, she would \"rain death on [the police's] miserable cursed soul,\" and started crying.<br/><br/>Yuki realized that there were some mothers who love their children that much, and then he recalled that in his haste to leave the Sohma House and get as far away as possible, he had in fact seen a girl; it was lost Tohru. Yuki backtracked and found Tohru, and was about to run back to Kyoko to tell her, but suddenly realized Tohru was following him. He decided to lead her back to her home, and when they had reached their destination, Yuki gave Tohru the hat he was wearing, which is later revealed to be the one he had gotten from Kyo some time before. He then transformed into a rat, (due to being weakened from having trouble breathing) and ran behind a corner to hide.<br/><br/>As Yuki watched Tohru and her mother reunite, he began to cry, because he was so grateful that he was able to help someone and feel needed at least once in his life. He also started to feel as though maybe the world was not as dark and hopeless as Akito told him it was.<br/><br/>In volume 10, Yuki confessed his love for Tohru, but later,in volume 14, it is revealed that he \"was looking for a mother in her\" and he always saw her more as a motherly figure; he confesses to a friend, Kakeru Manabe, that he was really confused about his feelings towards her because he felt it was weird the way he saw her as a 'mother' and he did not want to admit these feelings. Thus, he tried to approach Tohru in a girl/boy way, but he realized that he did not/could not love her that way because he tended to see her as a 'woman' complex. He also had started to come to the conclusion that Kyo was truly in love with Tohru (and vice versa) and he figured out that he would never be able to feel that way about her or look at her the way Kyo did, and resolved that he wanted Kyo and Tohru to be together because Kyo was the only one who would be able to make Tohru happy in that way.<br/><br/>After that, Yuki and Tohru were still friends, although, their relationship doesn't appear to be as deep, though it probably was. Yuki was trying to branch off from the Sohmas and Tohru, and Tohru was starting to fall more in love with Kyo. There is evidence of their relationship being deep, however, in chapter 136, where their hands are shown parting after Yuki finally tells Tohru how he feels about her (as a mother figure) and he calls her \"Tohru\" for the first time (as opposed to the usual \"Honda-san\") in their roughly three-year relationship.<br/><br/><h2>Relationship with Akito</h2><br/><br/>Yuki and Akito have a bitter past. Akito has been emotionally, physically, and mentally abusive towards Yuki; Yuki, as a result, was traumatized since then. In volume 15 it's revealed that, when Akito and Yuki were young children, Yuki was brought to the Main House to live with Akito. She kept him by her side at all times, seldom letting Yuki out of her sight. As Yuki recalled it, originally, Akito was kind and would only occasionally lose her temper. However, after Kureno's curse broke, Akito's world unraveled (since she had made the curse the basis of her existence), and she \"snapped.\" Akito painted the walls of her room black, and also locked Yuki away in a dark room built \"especially for [him]\" for long periods of times.<br/><br/>Yuki once cried to his mother that Akito said \"scary things\"; Akito filled Yuki's head with terrible words, such as that he was the most hated of all the Zodiac children. Not only that, but she was slowly chipping away at his will, telling him the world was a black place and that there was no reason to hope and no possibilities to make his life better. She continued this day after day, until Yuki began thinking it was the truth. As a result, Yuki started to get very sick from the emotional strain, especially after Kyo's rejection of his friendship, which confirmed what Akito was telling him. Akito pretended that she wanted to comfort the ailing boy, but when he went into his room she merely taunted him by once again repeating how much he was hated, asking him if he was going to die, and calling him boring.<br/><br/>In chapter 95, Yuki attended the New Year's banquet, and told Akito that he forgave him for all he had done, because he simply wanted to move on with his life, unbound by the pain of the past. This instantly reminded Akito of the day Kureno's curse had broken, and thus, she reacted violently, hitting Yuki with a vase and wounding his face.<br/><br/>In chapter 132, Yuki learned of Akito's true gender. When asked by Tohru if it surprised him, Yuki responded that he couldn't explain what he thought of it all, since lately, so much had happened to him (such as the curse breaking).<br/><br/>Relationship with Kyo<br/><br/>Originally, Yuki did not hate Kyo; he actually wanted to be friends with him. But Kyo refused, as he hated Yuki simply for being the sneaky, conniving Rat. When they first met, Yuki wandered away from the Sohma house and found Kyo, lingering in the snow. He had first thought to comment about Kyo's hair, which he quoted in his head \"Pretty Orange\", but Kyo intervened before he could say anything, asking if he was the Rat. When Yuki confirmed, Kyo declared his hatred to Yuki hotly, before running off. His second meeting with Kyo first started when Kyo dropped his red hat. Yuki picked it up and offered it to him, but Kyo turned the hat down, saying that if the rat touched the hat, it wasn't his anymore.<br/><br/>The hat ended up in the hands of Tohru, who had gotten lost as a child. Yuki (whom Tohru did not recall nor recognize when they met again as teenagers) found her and led her home, giving her Kyo's hat as a 'good job' gift.<br/><br/>It has only very recently been revealed that Kyo never hated Yuki for who he was, but had been so miserable with his life that he felt he needed a scapegoat for all his misfortune. Kyo felt it would only be logical for the Cat to blame the Rat and began to hate Yuki for this reason alone.<br/><br/>Their relationship has become more overly complex since this revelation. Kyo has always felt Yuki was more fortunate and always able to take advantage of a situation like one should, thus Kyo's dislike of Yuki stemmed from envy. However, Yuki reveals to Kyo that he is jealous of Kyo, because despite all of Kyo's bad luck and misfortunes, he is not passive like Yuki (something Yuki despises of himself) and able to comfortably express his own emotions and thoughts verbally, regardless of what they are. When they both confess to each other, Yuki is further upset because Kyo, as usual, was able to confess first. In addition, Yuki knows he can never love Tohru or be loved by Tohru in the same way that Kyo can. At the very end of the last volume in the last chapter of the manga, Kyo and Yuki smile while walking past each other, friendly calling each other the usual \"stupid cat,\" \"damn rat.\"<br/><br/> <h2>Relationship with Ayame</h2><br/><br/>When their relationship is first introduced Yuki shows downright hatred for his brother, ordering Shigure to skin Ayame's snake-form after he is first found inside Tohru's dress, even when it is later revealed that Ayame was merely doing this to stay warm as a result of being cold blooded. The two had a strained relationship since Yuki's childhood (they are ten years apart); Ayame tells Tohru that because of his brother's poor health, Yuki and he would often be separated for long periods of time, to the point Ayame almost forgot he had a younger brother. The rift between the two was cemented when a young Yuki tried to reach out to Ayame after Akito's mistreatment, but Ayame merely responded by pulling away, unable to understand Yuki's motives.<br/><br/>With prompting from Tohru, Yuki attempts to learn about his brother by visiting his store, which despite resulting in a large amount of disgust and shock from Yuki gives the brothers time to be honest with each other, even if that translated to an argument between the two. After Ayame's dramatic entrance during Yuki's parent-teacher conference with his domineering mother, in which he gives Yuki the confidence to reject his mother's control, the relationship between the two seems to improve greatly. Towards the end of the manga, Ayame offers to apartment-hunt for Yuki and be his guarantor, which Yuki accepts, even if it is slightly nervously.<br/><br/><h2>Relationship with Mother</h2><br/><br/>The fact that both Ayame and Yuki are members of the Jyunishi is quite unusual since it is very rare that any of the Jyunishi are siblings at any given time. Because their mother, who is only featured in the manga, was unable to force Ayame to bend to her will, she turned to Yuki and controlled every aspect of his life, including which schools he went to and what he would do after high school in college. Yuki became both emotionally fragile and detached in her attempts to gain status and wealth within the family while she bluntly and tactlessly shot down any attempts he made to refuse her wishes. This changes during a parent-teacher conference in which his mother gave him no say in his future, prompting Yuki to finally refuse her attempts after Ayame burst in dramatically and gave Yuki the confidence to stand up for his own ideals and dreams. Before Ayame's arrival, Yuki's mother countered Yuki's demands for a voice in deciding his future by claiming that he \"never had a worthwhile thought in his life\" and in his head, Yuki remembered how all his life, his mother refused to let words get to her and let them die, which is why he believed in not putting his own emotions into words. Later in the manga, Yuki asked his mother for a cell phone, the first attempt at making a better relationship with her, and she obliged by signing the paper he needed. She also tells him \"Don't...use it wastefully,\" causing Yuki to later laugh and think that that was the first time she said anything so motherly.<br/><br/>",

While <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40452\" href=\"/gravity/4005-40452/\" slug=\"gravity\">         Gravity</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57432\" href=\"/supermax/4005-57432/\" slug=\"supermax\">         Supermax</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7240\" href=\"/two-gun-kid/4005-7240/\" slug=\"two-gun-kid\">         Two-Gun Kid</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57431\" href=\"/johnny-cool/4005-57431/\" slug=\"johnny-cool\">         Johnny Cool</a> kept the monster occupied, Telemetry used her abilities access the internet and find information on the villain. After the headstrong Supermax attacks Zzzax before receiving orders, Telemetry used her abilities once again but this time to create an arrow out of psionic arrow. As she hurls the spear down towards the monster, Two-Gun Kid also attacks the opponent, unfortunately their attacks met eachother and not the foe. With the rest of the team having difficulties,  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42782\" href=\"/komodo/4005-42782/\" slug=\"komodo\">         Komodo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42784\" href=\"/hardball/4005-42784/\" slug=\"hardball\">         Hardball</a>  finished the job, while Hardball prepared to use his energy balls to disrupt Zzzax, Komodo distracted him in the river bed. Combining their abilities they successfully defeated the villain. Leaving Telemetry and fellow Heavy Hitter, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57688\" href=\"/non-stop/4005-57688/\" slug=\"non-stop\">         Non Stop</a> to tease the couple (Komodo &amp; Hardball). <br/><br/>Soon after, Komodo calls in the Heavy Hitters to help defeat the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\" href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" slug=\"hydra\">         Hydra</a> leader, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-35607\" href=\"/mr-woodman/4005-35607/\" slug=\"mr-woodman\">         Senator Woodman</a> &amp; Hardball. Gravity quickly uses his powers to throw the cars into the air, while Telemetry quickly took care of two Hydra Agents. While the action goes on around them, Woodman quickly injects himself with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1488\" href=\"/lizard/4005-1488/\" slug=\"lizard\">         Dr. Curt Connor's</a> serum turning him into a reptilian monster. With the rest of the team unable to defeat him they had to rely on Telemetry to defeat him. Unfortunately, Woodman had focused all his attention on her, leaving her to have to defend herself with a psionically constructed force field. As the fight ensued, Hardball quickly took to action as he used his abilities to create energy fields around Gravity, Telemetry, and Komodo. Realizing that the only way to stop the Hydra from leaving his friends and family alone, Hardball creates an energy field around Woodman and quickly shrinks it until the senator is squished. Now with his new status as Hydra leader, Hardball bids farewell before he gets into one of the Hydra jets and speeds off, leaving Telemetry and the rest of the Heavy Hitters to sit in silence. <br/><h3>Secret Invasion</h3>When the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\" href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" slug=\"skrulls\">         Skrull</a> sleeper agents were activated in <a data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\" href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" slug=\"secret-invasion\">         Secret Invasion</a>, Telemetry along with the Heavy Hitters helped the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42982\" href=\"/skrull-kill-krew/4060-42982/\" slug=\"skrull-kill-krew\">         Skrull Kill Krew</a>  defeat one of the Skrull's agents. Much to her chagrin, Telemetry was injured during the battle forcing Non Stop to use her super speed to take her to the E.R. <br/><h3>Fear Itself</h3>Commander <a href=\"///\"> </a><a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">     Steve Rogers</a> informs <a href=\"///\"> </a><a href=\"../../prodigy/29-4804/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-4804\" href=\"/prodigy/4005-4804/\" slug=\"prodigy\">     Prodigy</a>  of the unknown meteors that have fallen from the  heavens and mass panic is on the horizon. Rogers asks Prodigy to gather  heroes on a volunteer basis to help keep the peace and lead a new  Initiative where there is no forced conscription or registration.  Prodigy agrees to become the leader of the new Initiative and most of  the former Initiative members including Telemetry gather in Washington DC. Telemetry and the rest of the Heavy Hitters try to stop the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\" href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" slug=\"juggernaut\">   Juggernaut</a> in Las Vegas after he obtains a mystic hammer and is transformed into one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58278\" href=\"/the-worthy/4060-58278/\" slug=\"the-worthy\">  Worthy</a> as Kuurth: Breaker of Stone. Kuurth is truly unstoppable and smashes through Telemetry's psionic constructs with ease. Telemetry and the Heavy Hitters are forced to retreat when their leader, Hardball generates a powerful energy ball and appears to sacrifice himself to stop Kuurth. <br/><br/><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2>Telemetry is a talented young woman with the ability to create psionic based constructs. However the source of her abilities is not clear at this point, she has been shown to be very resourceful with her powers. The feats that she has performed include: Creating insect-like wings to fly, creating a keyboard and utilizing the internet, creating force fields, harnessing the power as psionic spears, and making a make-shift chair for her to hover above the Hoover Dam with. Most recently she has been shown to keep up with fellow Heavy Hitter, Non-Stop during usage of super-speed.  ",

The Dealers hide out in a warehouse somewhere in Upstate New York where  Starion plans to take in a young female child into their group instead  of having her move from foster home to foster home. The young girl's  name is Miranda and she receives an apple from Starion as he reveals his  true name as Denny. Starion is stunned when Miranda knows his true  identity and the Dread Dealers are wanted by <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      SHIELD</a>.

All four assassins are detained inside some type of bubble when a  SHIELD Hit Squad appears to arrest the New Warriors.

    "description": "<p>Angela Petrelli's abilites are dream related.  While dreaming, she can sense the future, though the images are not necessarily clear. She can appear in other's dreams and has shown a resistance to telepathic control.<br/><br/> </p><h2>Volume 1 Genesis </h2><br/>  Angela is taken in by the NYPD<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/NYPD\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>for shoplifting socks<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Socks\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. In doing this, she worries her son Nathan<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, while Peter<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, her younger son, sees it as a cry for attention. The next day, she sees Peter in the hospital and confesses to him that his father died of suicide<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Suicide\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, telling him she is worried he may be developing the same condition<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Depression\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. She tells Peter that he always was her favorite son. Later, she expresses concern for Peter when Nathan claims his jump was a suicide attempt. <br/> <p>A few days later, Angela plans a family brunch with Heidi<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Heidi\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>to help Nathan's campaign<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan%27s_campaign\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. The brunch is interrupted by Peter who suggests that he is not good enough to attend, but eventually saves Nathan in the interview with Oliver Dennison<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Oliver_Dennison\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. </p> <p>During the next two weeks she spends her time worried about a comatose Peter, fearing he may die of a heart attack. When Peter awakens and leaves in a rage, she is upset that Peter would keep her worried for these two weeks and just leave. Within the next few days, she persuades Nathan not to meet his long-lost daughter<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire_Bennet\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and bribe<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan%27s_bribe_money\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>Meredith<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Meredith\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>to end the situation. </p> <p>When Claire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire_Bennet\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>comes to New York City<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/New_York_City\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>to find Peter, she is instead greeted by Angela. She reveals she is Claire's grandmother. She explains to Claire about her biological parents and the fire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Fire_%281992%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, urging Claire to come with her to Paris<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Paris\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, but then Mohinder<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mohinder\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>arrives with Peter's dead body. When Peter is revived, she tells Peter she has long known about his abilities<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Empathic_mimicry\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Later on, she claims to also know about Linderman<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Linderman\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s plans. When Peter dreams<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter%27s_dreams\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>of his mother talking to the <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Death\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>late Charles<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Charles\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, she states she thinks Nathan will be who people turn to after the explosion<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Explosion\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Angela tries to get Claire out of the city, saying the bomb is inevitable; however, Claire disagrees and flees from Angela.  <br/> <br/></p> <h2>Volume 2 Generations </h2> <p><br/> </p> <p>Angela regularly visits Nathan<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>at his hospital room<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan%27s_hospital_room\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>while he recovers from the effects of Peter's explosion<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Explosion\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. When Nathan later blames her for Peter<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s presumed death<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Death\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, she finds a dead threat<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Death_threat\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>targeting her. She meets with Kaito Nakamura<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kaito_Nakamura\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>at Charles Deveaux'<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Charles_Deveaux\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>s rooftop<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Charles_Deveaux%27s_rooftop\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>to discuss the threats. After Kaito is murdered by a hooded killer<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Adam_Monroe\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Angela is interrogated by Matt Parkman<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt_Parkman\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, but she recognizes his interrogation techniques<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. She is attacked in the interrogation room when the lights mysteriously go out, and in her hospital room she falsely confesses to murdering Kaito<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kaito\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. </p> <p>While in jail, Angela is interrogated again by Matt Parkman<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt_Parkman\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, who manages to make her reveal information about Victoria Pratt<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Victoria_Pratt\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. After her \"early release\" from jail, she is confronted by Matt and Nathan about Adam Monroe<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Adam_Monroe\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. She explains how the group of twelve<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Company%27s_founders\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>came together, and why Adam<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Adam\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>is killing the Company's founders<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Company%27s_founders\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, while also secretly commanding Matt to kill Peter<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>if he causes any problems. After Nathan<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>is shot<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Unknown_assassin\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>moments before revealing the truth about the Company<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Company\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, we see Angela<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Angela\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>talking on the phone saying it had to be done, but that Pandora's Box<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>has been opened. </p>   <h2>Volume 3 Villains </h2> <p><br/>  <br/></p> <p>Angela confronts her son<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter_Petrelli_%28exposed_future%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>at the hospital where Nathan<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>is staying. She reveals her ability<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Precognitive_dreaming\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and demands that he brings her son back. Following the death of Bob Bishop<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Bob_Bishop\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Angela receives control of Primatech<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Primatech\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and as her first act, fires Elle Bishop<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Elle_Bishop\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>for releasing 12 dangerous individuals<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Level_5_escapees\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Angela then tricks Sylar<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>into believing that she is his mother and wins his trust by feeding him Bridget Balley<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Bridget_Bailey\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. After Noah Bennet<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Noah_Bennet\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>returns to the Company, Angela assigns him as Sylar's new partner and has them hunt down the villains. </p> <p>Angela continues to lie to Sylar, and soon finds Peter attacking him within his cell. Peter snaps Sylar's neck <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Enhanced_strength\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and attacks Angela, attempting to slice open her skull . Sylar saves her and Angela has Peter drugged and soon meets with Nathan and Tracy Strauss<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Tracy_Strauss\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Angela reveals that The Company gave Niki<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Niki\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Tracy, Barbara<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Barbara\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Nathan and many other people their abilities via a synthetic injection. Angela has another dream, during which she witnesses the deaths of Tracy, Nathan and Peter at the hands of her tought to be dead husban<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Arthur_Petrelli\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Arthur then causes Angela to go into a coma. </p> <p>Via a spirit walk, Hiro<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Hiro\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>learns that Angela attempted to kill Arthur after he used his telepathic powers <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>to manipulate her mind and make her agree with the plan to murder Nathan. Angela also somehow enters Sylar's dreams and manages to wake him up from his induced coma. Matt Parkman<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt_Parkman\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>uses his powers to enter Angela's comatose mind and battles Arthur to free her. Finally Angela is able to use Matt and Daphne's love for each other to remind Arthur of their own love and he lets her go allowing Matt to bring her out of her coma. Once Angela awakens, she is rejoined with Claire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Peter, Nathan, Matt and Daphne<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Daphne\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Angela takes Claire to Noah and prepares the Company for war with Pinehearst. Before Angela, Noah, Meredit<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Meredith\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and Claire can leave for Pinehearst, Sylar arrives and locks them inside Primatech. Sylar manages to capture Angela and interrogates her on the fact that she is not his birth mother. As Angela confesses her true knowledge of Sylar's parents, Claire shows up and kills him. </p>   <h2>Volume 4 Fugitives </h2> <p><br/>  After the destruction of both Primatech and Pinehearst, Angela and one of her employees<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Carlos\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>abduct Rachel Mills <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Rachel_Mills\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and interrogate her to learn the location of the last vial of The Formula<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_formula\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. After locating it, Angela returns to New York and spends a few months looking at colleges with Claire. Angela is contacted by Nathan, who tells her to keep Claire away from Peter and Matt. After the crash of Flight 195<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Flight_195\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Nathan calls Angela again and recounts exactly what happened. Angela refuses to help Nathan. Through the memories of Noah, it is revealed that Angela shut down the Company in order to rebuild her family. In present time, Noah and Angela meet and discuss plans to stop the hunt for evolved humans<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Evolved_humans\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>from the inside. </p> <p>Nathan suspects Angela of being Rebel<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Rebel\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>but she denies the claims. She soon receives a visit from Emile Danko<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Emile_Danko\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and is questioned about Nathan's possible powers<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Powers\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. After Danko takes over the operation, Angela becomes a target of the government. Using her dreams, Angela avoids capture and receives help from one of her friends<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Millie\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Peter rescues Angela and takes her to the church where she was married. Angela reveals details about her past, including the manifestation of her dreams and existence of a sister<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Alice_Shaw\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Angela has Peter take her to the Coyote Sands<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Coyote_Sands\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, a location which she also gets Nathan, Claire and Noah to travel to. Once everyone is gathered, Angela has everyone start to dig up the shallow graves of the former prisoners of the sands. </p>Angela recounts her time in the sands, arriving there with her family at the age of 16. She remembers how close she was to her sister and her first meeting with Charles Deveaux<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Charles_Deveaux\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Linderman<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Linderman\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and Bob. She tells her family what happened at the sands when it was a concentration camp and reveals that she escaped with her friends and when she returned, everything was gone, including her family. After a vicious storm manifests within the sands, Angela is taken to her sister’s bunker. Angela reveals to Alice that she lied about her dream and Alice leaves her, refusing to join Angela’s family. Angela, Peter, Nathan, Noah and Claire go to the diner and all agree to form a new company.  <p>After learning that Sylar has taken Nathan's apeeareance<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Shape_shifting\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Angela, Noah and Claire attempt to drive to Washington<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Washington\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Noah has the ladies get out of the car as he suspects a government ambush to be coming. Angela and Claire arrive at Washington and the two part ways. Angela makes her way to a bus stop where she meets with Matt. She reveals that she had a dream where Matt saves Nathan and she eventually convinces Matt to follow her. After finding Nathan's dead body, a distraught and grieving Angela has Matt use his powers to force Sylar to think he is Nathan, effectively \"recreating\" her son and \"killing\" Sylar. </p> <p>Five weeks later, Angela visits Sylar/Nathan in Nathan's office. She expresses her worry for him, a worry which is furthered when Sylar/Nathan ignores her and unknowingly uses his ability<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Intuitive_aptitude\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>to fix a fast clock.  <br/> <br/> <br/></p> <h2>Volume 5 Redemption </h2> <p><br/>  Angela calls Noah<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Noah\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and gives him the assignment of killing Tracy Strauss<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Tracy_Strauss\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>as she has been responsible for the murders of several Building 26<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Tracy%27s_victims\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Building_26\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>agents. She asks him why he has been avoiding \"Nathan\"'s calls and Noah corrects her, asking if she means Sylar. Angela claims they did what they had to do but Noah admits he thinks it was the wrong move. Angela ends the conversation by telling him to get the company<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Company\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>started again. </p> <p>Angela has lunch at Kojin Sushi<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kojin_Sushi\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and is shocked to see Sylar walk in, dressed like Nathan. He kisses her on the cheek and apologises for his lack of manners. Angela awakens from her dreams<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Precognitive_dreaming\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>just as her car arrives at the restaurant. \"Nathan\" walks in and apologises for being late. Angela discusses Noah's lack of cooperation with them and Nathan tells her that he will take care of it. He then confides in Angela that he hasn't been feeling like himself and Angela tells him to get a sports car and a younger woman just like his father<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Arthur_Petrelli\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>did. </p> <p>Angela, knowing something is wrong with \"Nathan\", calls Matt Parkman<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt_Parkman\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and pleads with him to reinforce<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>the Nathan persona onto Sylar. Matt refuses and tells her that he has quit using his ability. Angela tells him that there is no such thing as quiting and hangs up after Matt once again refuses her request. </p>  <br/> <p>Angela brings some toys to \"Nathan\"<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>in his office and invites him to relive some childhood memories. She watches as he examines the stuff and smiles. After learning that he has been talking to Millie<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Millie\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>about Kelly<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kelly_Houston\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Angela goes to speak with \"Nathan\". He tells her all he knows about what happened the night she died and Angela tells him that she made The Haitian to erase his memories  <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Haitian\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mental_manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>so that he could forget. \"Nathan\" asks if Angela is going to let Millie think that Kelly ran away because she was a horrible mother and Angela tells him that if it protects her family then yes, she will. </p> <p>Angela later has dinner with Millie and apologizes for \"Nathan\"'s behaviour. She tells her that he hasn't been himself lately and Millie tells her not to worry about it. She receives a phone call but then tells Angela that it wasn't important and proposes a toast, to \"closure\". </p>  <br/>Angela joins Peter at his apartment<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter%27s_apartment\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>for dinner. While Peter is talking to her, she seems distant. The two eat dinner and Peter tells her that he has to go to work. Angela tells him that she will stay in his apartment a little longer in case \"Nathan\"  <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>is running late.  <br/> <p><br/></p>",

    "description": "<p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-18745\" href=\"/dan-garret/4005-18745/\">Dan Garrett</a> found the Scarab on an archeological dig. It became his symbol to fight crime as the Blue Beetle. It also gave him super strength, flight, and the ability to create lightning when he cried the word 'Khaji Da' out loud.</p><p>The Second Blue Beetle, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2054\" href=\"/ted-kord/4005-2054/\">Ted Kord</a> was given the Scarab, however he was never able to use it. Shortly before his death, the wizard <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2365\" href=\"/shazam/4005-2365/\">Shazam</a> steals the Scarab from him seeing that it will soon fall into the hands of a great hero.</p><p>The Scarab later finds <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4438\" href=\"/blue-beetle/4005-4438/\">Jaime Reyes</a> and embeds itself onto his spine. Jaime can access the full power of the Scarab to create a alien suit of armor. Jaime learns that the Scarab is actually a life form create by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48034\" href=\"/the-reach/4060-48034/\">The Reach</a> sent to Earth in order to conquer it. It was, however, unable to fulfill its mission because it was too damaged to fully take over its hosts body. It turns out that Khaji Da is the name of the Scarab.</p>",

    "description": "<p>While looking for a murderer in the New York subway tunnels, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\">Spider-Man</a>, and NYPD Lieutenant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19364\" href=\"/lt-tara-curson/4005-19364/\" slug=\"lt-tara-curson\">Tara Curson</a> came across <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2481\" href=\"/mole-man/4005-2481/\" slug=\"mole-man\">Mole Man</a> and his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56642\" href=\"/subterraneans-moloids/4060-56642/\" slug=\"subterraneans-moloids\">Moloids</a>. Curson told Mole Man that he was under arrest for several murders committed above ground, but Mole Man claimed neither he nor any of his creatures were the cause of those murders, as his ultimate goal was world domination and didn't call for random murders of innocent people. He instead told them of a group of mutants that had recently taken up residence in his tunnels, vicious surface-dwellers with monstrous creatures and powerful weaponry. Wolverine then suggested that Mole Man lead them to these mutants so that they could find their murderer and leave Mole Man's underground kingdom in peace, a deal that Mole Man willingly accepted.</p><p>After leading them to the area where the mutants were, Mole Man left - only for Wolverine, Spider-Man and Curson to be attacked and overpowered by several of the mutants. Carver then introduced himself to the group, informing them that he wasn't going to let their trespassing into his territory go unpunished. Wolverine tries to attack Carver, but is stopped by a huge, hairy creature that smashes him into the ground. Carver introduces the creature as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19365\" href=\"/fugue/4005-19365/\" slug=\"fugue\">Fugue</a>, and that he is the murderer they've been looking for. However, he also tells them that Fugue isn't actually intelligent enough to know right from wrong. Wolverine tells Carver that doesn't excuse murder and that Fugue should be held accountable for his actions, but Carver simply responds by saying that he and his group are <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3191\" href=\"/morlocks/4060-3191/\" slug=\"morlocks\">Morlocks</a> and that they don't have to abide by the rules and morals of the surface world. Wolverine then challenges Carver to a duel for leadership of the group, as per Morlock law.</p><p>Soon Carver and Wolverine battle atop a pillar surrounded by a deep, fiery chasm, while both of their allies are forced to simply watch. Carver proves to be a tough opponent, until Wolverine slashes one of his eyes - one of Carver's few weak spots. Furious, Fugue leaps onto the pillar to attack Wolverine, but Wolverine slashes him and nearly causes Fugue to fall into the chasm, only for him to be held up thanks to one of Spider-Man's webs.</p><p>Suddenly, the ground begins to shake, causing both Carver and Wolverine to fall off the pillar. Wolverine tries to keep Carver from falling into the chasm while Spider-Man tries to do the same for Fugue. The ground continues to shake however, causing Carver to slip and Spider-Man's webbing to break, resulting in both Fugue and Carver falling into the chasm. Mole Man then appears, eager to help them escape from an oncoming landslide. As they make their way back to the surface, Wolverine asks Mole Man whether or not he was the one who caused the earthquake - but Mole Man simply brushes the question aside.</p><p>It's presumed that both Carver and Fugue perished. They have yet to make a reappearance.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Carver is a mutant who possesses enhanced strength, speed, endurance, and reflexes.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Psionics, real name Cindy is from a future and alternate reality where the worlds end has come, resources draining, mass deaths due to starvation and freak weather and natural disasters taking its toll, Earths heroes attempt to save as many as they can by capturing and harnessing Galactus power. Such a lofty cast was not without a price, with hundreds of heroes being killed in the process, Psionics being one of the few survivors alongside Lightwave, Alex Ultron, Hulk Jr, the Hooded Man and Natalie X.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Psionics is a Marvel published comics character created by writer Mark Millar and artist Bryan Hitch during their Fantastic Four run. Psionics first appears in Fantastic Four #555 - World's Greatest, Part Two of Four. </p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Psionics first appears as your average villain in her Fantastic Four debut stealing diamonds. However this is quickly subverted as Human Torches attempts to stop her is not only met by resistance but a quick passionate kiss, setting up a romantic subplot for both characters. Despite her villainous ways, Psionics is made to be a fairly sympathetic character, with a lucky go attitude but not an inherent maliciousness. Later it is revealed that Psionics was actually from the future and that many of her careless acts of villainy were actually purposeful and that she required the money to build a base for her teammates who were planning something incredibly ambitious.</p><p>The character and her future companions would also get a mini series focusing on them known as Fantastic Force. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Johnny Storm</h3><p><a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a> is about to go to his rehearsal when suddenly, he saw a diamond shipment being robbed by a superhuman. When the enforcers tried to stop her from what she is doing, she just caused more troubles and accidents. Johnny fought her but didn't expect Psionics' power to be so strong. Psionics kissed the weakened Johnny storm and they developed a strong affection toward each other. Even if it is wrong for Johnny to have a relationship with a villain like Psionics, they continued their affair. She even goes to his place naked and said that she just robbed another bank. Johnny eventually broke it off, but Psionics was angry that Johnny never even asked why she needed so much money.</p><h3>New Defenders</h3><p>The truth was that she was from the future and a member of the <a href=\"/new-defenders/4060-55735/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55735\"> New Defenders</a>; their goal was to make a time machine powerful enough to save the remaining people of their Earth, which was on the brink of destruction. Psionics and her father <a href=\"/lightwave/4005-57714/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57714\"> Lightwave</a> went and captured Johnny, because he was essential to helping power their device.</p><p>In the end, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\"> Fantastic Four</a> stopped them from bringing their entire population to Earth and rerouted them to <a href=\"/nu-world/4020-55680/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55680\"> Nu-World</a>, an artificial Earth. Psionics and the other New Defenders went their to live with their people. But soon after, the sun of Nu-World collapsed in on itself and created a black hole. War broke out and Lightwave and <a href=\"/alex-ultron/4005-57812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57812\"> Alex Ultron</a> seized control of the planet.</p><p>When some members of the Fantastic Four came for a visit, Lightwave planned for them to kidnap <a href=\"/valeria-richards/4005-2470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2470\"> Valeria Richards</a>, because she would be smart enough to help them fix their portal and save everyone by sending them to Earth. Psionics was sent to capture her and in the process she killed <a href=\"/alyssa-moy/4005-6438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6438\"> Alyssa Moy</a> and turned on the <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\"> Thing</a> and her former lover. She was caught off guard and killed by <a href=\"/hulk-jr/4005-58485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58485\"> Hulk Jr.</a>, who was their captive for not agreeing with her fathers methods.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Psionics possesses the ability to create psionic forces, akin to telekinesis or force fields, to push and propel objects in her vicinity. The degree of which is unknown but Psionics is sufficiently powerful enough to throw and upturn cars and trucks at a minimum. Psionics can use her powers to fly. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br/></h2>Natalie X comes from a future where the Earth is dying. She, along with all the remaining heroes and villains of her time, formed the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55735\" href=\"/new-defenders/4060-55735/\" slug=\"new-defenders\"> New Defenders</a> to find a solution to the problem and save the remaining inhabitants of Earth. Battling and capturing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\"> Galactus </a>to power a time machine, Natalie is one of only seven that survived.  She formed a relationship with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57812\" href=\"/alex-ultron/4005-57812/\" slug=\"alex-ultron\"> Alex Ultron</a>, as she could not read his thoughts. <br/> <br/>Natalie came with the remaining heroes to the past to capture <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\"> Doctor Doom</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\" href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" slug=\"human-torch\"> Human Torch</a> to help power the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55741\" href=\"/the-galactus-engine/4015-55741/\" slug=\"the-galactus-engine\"> Galactus Engine</a>, which would be used to bring the remaining billions on their Earth to the past. Being the most powerful telepath of her time, Natalie was able to subdue the mighty Doctor Doom by implanting many nightmares into his psyche.  <br/> <br/>The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\" href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" slug=\"fantastic-four\"> Fantastic Four</a> stopped their plans and instead transported the future refugees to an artificial planet called <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55680\" href=\"/nu-world/4020-55680/\" slug=\"nu-world\"> Nu-World</a>. But the creator of Nu-World, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51263\" href=\"/ted-castle/4005-51263/\" slug=\"ted-castle\"> Ted Castle</a>, did not appreciate them being there and destroyed the portal off the planet. After they battled him, they reformed as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-18869\" href=\"/fantastic-force/4060-18869/\" slug=\"fantastic-force\"> Fantastic Force</a>. Just then, they were attacked by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3445\" href=\"/betty-ross/4005-3445/\" slug=\"betty-ross\"> Harpy</a>, which Natalie could tell was being mentally blocked from her.  <br/> <br/>She soon learned why. She was one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57935\" href=\"/hysteries/4060-57935/\" slug=\"hysteries\"> Hysteries</a>, formed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15778\" href=\"/gaea/4005-15778/\" slug=\"gaea\"> Gaea </a>to bring her people back to her on their dying world. Natalie was no match for the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9731\" href=\"/dark-phoenix/4005-9731/\" slug=\"dark-phoenix\"> Dark Phoenix's</a> mental powers, but she was allowed to leave and try to convince the others to send some of the people back to Gaea. She was unable to do so, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58485\" href=\"/hulk-jr/4005-58485/\" slug=\"hulk-jr\"> Hulk Jr.</a> was able to send them back to their respective times.  <br/> <br/>Next, Gaea sent <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19936\" href=\"/ego/4005-19936/\" slug=\"ego\"> Ego the Living Planet</a> to destroy Nu-World. Natalie, along with Alex Ultron and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57712\" href=\"/psionics/4005-57712/\" slug=\"psionics\"> Psionics</a>, went to face Ego themselves. Natalie used her power to unlock Psionics' full potential, where she gave Ego a massive stroke and stopped him.  <br/> <br/>It seemed all the troubles were in the past until the sun collapsed on itself and formed a black hole. This caused war among the residents of Nu-World. Under the leadership of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57714\" href=\"/lightwave/4005-57714/\" slug=\"lightwave\"> Lightwave </a>and Alex Ultron, they used Natalie X's telepathy to control as many of the populace as she could handle. She then essentially became the worldmind of Nu-World.",

    "deck": "Lightwave is Psionics' father and a member of The New Defenders.  He is from the planet Zenn-La, the Silver Surfer's home.",
    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br/></h2><p>Lightwave comes from an alternate timeline where the Earth is dying in the year 2509. Originally from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41038\" href=\"/zenn-la/4020-41038/\" slug=\"zenn-la\"> Zenn-La</a>, Lightwave was once a super villain and has referred to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\"> Galactus</a> as his former master. He and his daughter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57712\" href=\"/psionics/4005-57712/\" slug=\"psionics\"> Psionics</a> are some of the last remaining heroes after a battle in which they capture Galactus to use as a power source to complete their plan: transport themselves and the remaining survivors of Earth back in time to save them.</p><p>Lightwave and the other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55735\" href=\"/new-defenders/4060-55735/\" slug=\"new-defenders\"> New Defenders</a> traveled back in time to implement this plan and bring the remaining people back with them. Along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57812\" href=\"/alex-ultron/4005-57812/\" slug=\"alex-ultron\"> Alex Ultron</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57713\" href=\"/natalie-x/4005-57713/\" slug=\"natalie-x\"> Natalie X</a>, they easily broke into the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\" href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" slug=\"baxter-building\"> Baxter Building</a> and defeated the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\" href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" slug=\"thing\"> Thing</a>, capturing their first target: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\"> Doctor Doom</a>. Lightwave and his daughter were then sent to capture the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\" href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" slug=\"human-torch\"> Human Torch</a>, but in the end it was the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\"> Hooded Man</a> (Wolverine) who captured him.</p><p>The plan went accordingly, but the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\" href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" slug=\"fantastic-four\"> Fantastic Four</a> came to rescue Johnny and changed the coordinates of the future refugees to an artificial planet known as <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55680\" href=\"/nu-world/4020-55680/\" slug=\"nu-world\"> Nu-World</a>. Lightwave and the others went there to live the rest of their lives in peace. The team then changed their name to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-18869\" href=\"/fantastic-force/4060-18869/\" slug=\"fantastic-force\"> Fantastic Force</a> to honor Sue and Lightwave was nominated as their new leader.</p><p>As this happened, they were attacked by a flying green monster, who <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58485\" href=\"/hulk-jr/4005-58485/\" slug=\"hulk-jr\"> Hulk Jr.</a> claimed to be his mother. She blasted Lightwave with gamma radiation, a weakness among <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57886\" href=\"/zenn-lavians/4060-57886/\" slug=\"zenn-lavians\"> Zenn-Lavians</a>. Psionics was able to take him to the hospital, where the robotic doctors repaired him. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3445\" href=\"/betty-ross/4005-3445/\" slug=\"betty-ross\"> Harpy</a> was just one of the attackers, the rest being even more powerful. Known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57935\" href=\"/hysteries/4060-57935/\" slug=\"hysteries\"> Hysteries</a>, they were formed by an insane <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15778\" href=\"/gaea/4005-15778/\" slug=\"gaea\"> Gaea</a> who wished to get her children back to her dying Earth.</p><p>After the Hysteries were dispatched, Gaea called in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19936\" href=\"/ego/4005-19936/\" slug=\"ego\"> Ego</a>, the Living Planet, to destroy Nu-World. Lightwave went to investigate and was captured. He was rescued by his daughter when she unleashed all her powers on Ego's brain. Wolverine left them to stay with Gaea and use his healing factor to help her get new life on the world.</p><p>But soon after, the sun collapsed and Nu-World was doomed and sent into chaos. Seeing no other option, Lightwave and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57812\" href=\"/alex-ultron/4005-57812/\" slug=\"alex-ultron\"> Alex Ultron</a> took control of the warring populace, controlling them with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57713\" href=\"/natalie-x/4005-57713/\" slug=\"natalie-x\"> Natalie X</a>. At this point, Lightwave and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58485\" href=\"/hulk-jr/4005-58485/\" slug=\"hulk-jr\"> Hulk Jr.</a> disagreed about this course of action and Hulk Jr. was made their prisoner.</p><p>When a few members of the Fantastic Four came to visit Nu-World, Lightwave decided that their best hope was to capture <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2470\" href=\"/valeria-richards/4005-2470/\" slug=\"valeria-richards\"> Valeria Richards</a>. With her intellect, they could repair their portal and escape back to Earth and save the remaining people. Alex Ultron would not agree to kidnapping the daughter of the man who they had respected so much. Lightwave sent Psionics to capture Valeria, but she was killed when Hulk Jr. was released. The outcome of these events has yet to unfold. <br/><br/></p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46470/2243512-lightwave2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2243512\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.43740340030912\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:43.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46470/2243512-lightwave2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2243512\"><img alt=\"Explanation of his powers.\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/46470/2243512-lightwave2.png\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46470/2243512-lightwave2.png 647w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/46470/2243512-lightwave2.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Explanation of his powers.</figcaption></figure><p>The nature of Lightwave's powers remain unexplained.

He also boasts superhuman strength, the limits of which have not been explored. It has not been revealed if his physical strength is due to his morphology or the result of his force fields or some other application of his psionic powers.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Aladdin was born to Cassim and an unnamed woman. When Aladdin was only an infant his father left him and his mother. Soon after his father left Aladdin's mother was captured by bandits when Aladdin was only two years old and was presumed dead. Due to being orphaned so early, Aladdin never received a formal education, and thus was forced to learn to survive in the streets of Agrabah. Lacking other means, he steals only to survive, but his good heart often moves him to give what he has stolen to others who need it more than him. Aladdin is also often seen with his best friend Abu (a monkey).</p>",

    "deck": "A member of the Sohma family who transforms into a cat when ever he is hugged by a woman. He is Yuki's rival to Tohru.",
    "description": "<h2>Personality and background</h2><br/>Kyo's mother, in despair over having her son born a \"monster,\" committed suicide by walking in front of an oncoming train (Chapter 119) when he was a young child of possibly four to six years old. His father abandoned him as well, blaming Kyo for his mother's death. People have criticized Kyo throughout his life for his differences, too frightened or never bothering to glance beyond the label of \"The Cat\" and regard Kyo as a true person. Like most of the Sohmas, throughout his school years, he begins to get picked on for the color of his hair but he would chase them around, threatening to kill them, which was around the time his temper began.<br/><br/>Because of the Jyuunishi curse, Kyo must always wear a Juzu bead bracelet. These beads were made from the bones of a priest and warrior, and so they are a powerful protective charm. The beads themselves are alternately pale and either red (in the manga) or dark purple (in the anime), with the dark ones supposedly stained by blood. Whenever these beads are taken off his wrist, Kyo transforms into the cat's \"true form\", which is a beast that resembles a mutated rabbit-like form, which has a horribly foul stench that even caused Tohru to throw up. This form is a result of the Jyuunishi curse, and only the cat transforms into this form. The Juzu beads are handed down to the current cat of the Zodiac from the previous cat, and must always be worn. In episode 24 Kazuma Sohma takes the beads off Kyo's wrist and he turns into the cat's true form. He does this purposely in front of Tohru Honda, trying to test what Tohru truly feels for Kyo.<br/><br/>Early in the manga it is established that of all the Sohmas suffering from the Zodiac curse it is Kyo, as the cat, who is generally the most reviled (although he is frequently viewed with pity or sometimes even uneasy acceptance rather than outright hatred, and it is implied that Kyo may be hated by certain members of the Sohma clan more than others - Akito seems to despise Kyo more than any other of the zodiac). In chapter 108 of the manga, Shigure tells Tohru that the members of the Zodiac are \"monsters...disgusting creatures,\" and that \"the existence of the cat is our salvation...He's a monster even uglier than we are, inferior to everything.\" He adds that the cat has an obligation to accept the fact that he will be isolated from society (essentially imprisoned for the remainder of his life), \"discriminated against and looked down upon,\" because seeing this allows the other members of the Zodiac to feel better about themselves, at least better off than the cat.<br/><br/>He also made a bet with Akito that he will beat Yuki before they graduate. But if Kyo doesn't beat Yuki before they graduate, Kyo will be locked in the Cat's Room for the rest of his life; if he does, then he will be accepted as a full member of the zodiac. Akito knows - or is very confident that - Kyo will never defeat Yuki in anything. There are many possible reasons why Akito made this bet.<br/><br/>- Out of his hatred for the cat because it is not within the zodiac - To distract Kyo from trying to find a way to be rid of the curse by giving him an impossible hope for a way out - In order to cause Kyo to have even more hatred for Yuki, making Yuki more self-conscious and Akito using that for his own benefit (Akito has a sort of attachment to Yuki - he could believe that using Yuki's self-consciousness to make him cling to Akito) - To feel superior to Kyo (This seems to be his problem...)<br/><br/><h2><span>Relationship with Tohru Honda</span></h2> <p>The first time Kyo meets Tohru is when Tohru accidentally finds out the Sohma family secret. At first, it seems that Kyo truly dislikes Tohru, treating her with his typical harsh and angry manner. After Tohru accidentally causes him to transform behind the school, Kyo angrily shouts \"Stay out of my way! What's with you?! I can't even stand to look at you!\" He later apologizes in the woods for what he said. The reason behind his reaction to her is revealed to be because of his feelings of guilt involving her mother's death. Standing near her, Kyo could have saved her from the oncoming car, but his fear of transforming in public made him hesitate and was thus unable to prevent her death. To cope with the guilt of believing he had been the reason Kyoko had died, Kyo pressed all of the blame onto Yuki, the hated Rat, in an attempt to ease his own burden. Likewise with Tohru, his temper was often short and he retaliated to her efforts of friendship by pushing her further and further away. However, just with the other members of the Sohma family, Kyo is drawn to Tohru by her kind and generous personality.</p> <p>It eventually becomes apparent that Kyo's feelings have blossomed into love, something which both shames and terrifies him due to his believe that, as the Cat and the monster he turns in to, that no one could ever love him, as well as the guilt of the deaths of Tohru's mother and his own. Before he has even realized the extent of his emotion, it is clearly detected by others, such as Yuki, Arisa, and Saki. Saki, when in volume four, is visiting Kyoko's grave with Tohru, Yuki, Kyo, and Arisa, asks why Kyo is \"standing before a grave with such feelings of regret... chaos.\". Kyo finally confesses his love to himself and Akito in their confrontation in volume 11 and then breaks things off for good with Kagura Sohma in volume 12. In volume 17 he gives Tohru a paper flower when he hurts her feelings. Kyo and Tohru start to feel nervous around each other, for the two are realizing the true extent of their feelings (the mere act of touching hands sends them into fits of embarrassed babbling). It is also revealed in volume 16 that Kyo met Kyoko (Tohru's mother) in his childhood and even befriended her and, through her, knew of Tohru. In Chapter 122 and 123, when Tohru falls off a cliff while extending a hand of friendship to Akito Sohma and hits her head, Kyo finally admits his feelings to her, although she is not coherent enough to understand. Whilst she lies unconscious, Kyo kisses her on the lips, begging her not to die.</p> <p>During Tohru's stay at hospital, Kyo made several attempts to visit her but was turned aside by both Tohru's friends and his own fear. Finally he admits that before he can see Tohru, he must tie up the loose ends of his own life and goes to see his father. After Tohru is released from the hospital, Kyo finally visits her, only to have her flee from him, due to him rejecting her confession of love. Unwilling to give up this time, Kyo gives chase to Tohru, remarking on how fast she is, but that he is faster. Eventually he catches up with her and confesses the extent of his feelings for her, this time whilst she is conscious and able to hear. Tohru does not feel she has to forgive Kyo, rather, she just wants to stay with him and reiterates the strength of her love. Overcome, the two embrace, only to realize that Kyo has not transformed. On the last page of chapter 129, the quote, \"When one who was never loved is loved, the ancient promise nears the end\" meaning that when Kyo found love, both given and received, the curse will be broken. Realizing the truth, Kyo tore off his beads, sending them scattering to the ground, a testament to the end of the curse as Tohru looks on, weeping with joy.</p><br/><h2><span>Relationship with his parents</span></h2> <p>Kyo had an unsteady relationship with his mother, who always seemed protective of him when he was a child. She claimed that she loved him, but Kyo knew deep down that she didn't really because of how she refused to acknowledge his \"true form.\" Kyo always wondered if his mother was ashamed of him because he was possessed by the spirit of the cat and that his mother didn't want others to know about him. After his mother committed suicide, Kyo's father blamed the death on him because he was the cursed cat. In volume 9 of the Manga, Kyo's father is seen blaming Kyo on all of the bad things that had happened to him. He also makes a brief appearance in volume 6, saying to Kyo \"Your mother loved you more than anyone!\" Towards the end of the manga, Kyo makes an effort to reconcile with his father, but was violently rejected by the man. It was during this confrontation when Kyo realizes that his father had shunned his mother in addition to him, hinting that his mother committed suicide because of her protectiveness of Kyo. Kyo sees how pitiful his father was in blaming everything on him and decides to leave. Whether he reconciled with his father by the end of the manga is unknown.</p><br/><h2>Breaking the curse</h2><br/><br/>On the last page of chapter 129 the quote, \"When one who was never loved is loved, that ancient promise nears the end\", is read. The implication is that when the cat, who was never truly loved nor ever truly fell in love, finds love at last, the curse of the Sohma family will near its end. Shigure Sohma has already noted the Sohma curse is weakening, especially considering Kureno (and later Momiji and Hiro) had been freed and Hatori's transformation is less than what was expected.<br/><br/>In Chapter 129, after Kyo and Tohru discover that he is free from the curse, Kyo tears off the beads on his wrist now that he no longer needs them; however he then suddenly feels unusual not wearing them and Tohru goes and picks them up. With the cat now free, a chain reaction begins as the remaining cursed members of the family are freed. Soon Ayame Sohma hugs Mine, Ritsu Sohma breaks a bowl in shock, and Kisa Sohma begins to cry as she plays with Hiro's baby sister. Kagura Sohma senses something has changed while she shops for groceries, as Isuzu Sohma and Hatsuharu Sohma embrace. Hatori Sohma, who was just out of the estate, is freed as well, while Shigure Sohma comments to himself the odd sensation of being freed. Out on a bench waiting for Machi, we see Yuki Sohma being freed from the curse as well and then kisses Machi when she comes. As Akito and the now freed Jyunishi break out in tears, a ghostly figure comes and takes the spirit of the Rat away, saying \"Thank you for keeping your promise for such a long time.\"",

    "description": "<h3><span>Ayame Sohma</span></h3> <p>Ayame Sohma<span></span>, aged 27–28, is the <span>snake</span> of the Chinese zodiac, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57673\" href=\"/yuki-sohma/4005-57673/\" slug=\"yuki-sohma\">Yuki</a>'s older brother. Ayame is depicted as vivacious, flamboyant, self-confident, and self-centered, with a knack for annoying Yuki and <span>Kyo</span> (one of the few things they initially agree upon). In an author's note, Natsuki Takaya described him as a draining person to meet in real life.Despite his age, he refers to himself with the boyish pronoun <em>boku</em> . He has gorgeous eyes (gold in the manga, yellow-green in the anime) and silver hair quite similar to Yuki's violet eyes and grey hair.He runs a shop, named after himself, that sells custom-made \"romantic costumes\" with the help of <span>Mine Kuramae</span>, his seamstress and girlfriend. He is best friends with <span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Shigure</span></span> and <span>Hatori</span>, who are the same age; Ayame and Shigure like to pretend that they are lovers,while Hatori is the only one, according to Shigure and Takaya, who can restrain Ayame's worst behavior. As the snake, Ayame is especially susceptible to cold.When Ayame was in high school, he was president of the student council,and is proud that Yuki is following him.He sometimes over reacts, or over does things, like explaining to a teacher that he was a super magical being, and could not cut his long silver hair. Ayame fears the \"nothingness\" of not being acknowledged. Ayame can also be serious at times, such as when he took Tohru out for lunch. He described how he wants to be closer to Yuki and tries to get closer to him. When Ayame was young, he completely ignored Yuki, and even forgot Yuki's name and in doing this Shigure became mad at him for the first time. After this he became depressed and drank alot until Hatori finally put an end to it. He realized that when he got older, he would be totally alone without his brother, spurring an obsession of gaining Yuki's love.He does this by doing things such as embroidering \"Lives for my older brother\" on the back of Yuki's shirt. As the series progresses, Yuki slowly starts to accept Ayame as a brother, and even tries to understand him. When Ayame is freed from the curse, the first thing he does is finally embrace Mine. Takaya derived his name (normally a female name, meaning  from the fifth month, <em><strong>ayame</strong>zuki</em> or \"month of falling irises,\" which is the month of the snake, of the traditional Japanese calendar.</p>",

    "description": "<h2><span>Kisa Sohma</span></h2> <p>Kisa Sohma<span></span>, aged 12–13, is the <span>tiger</span> of the Chinese zodiac. She is depicted as a cute but very shy and withdrawn girl. In an author's note, Natsuki Takaya described her as \"in competition to be the first or second most beautiful character\"and also described her as a \"girly-girl.\" When she starts middle school, her classmates harass and ostracize her due to her naturally tawny hair and golden eyes, an effect of her curse. Because she feels ashamed of being <span>bullied</span>, she does not tell her worried mother what is happening and stops speaking; when this distresses her mother even further, she runs away and is found by <span>Hatsuharu</span>.<span>Tohru Honda</span>, who understands Kisa's distress because she was once bullied herself, helps Kisa to come out of her shell, and Kisa becomes very attached to her, calling her \"onee-chan\" (\"big sister\") in both the manga and Japanese language anime, while in the English dubbed anime she calls her \"Sissy\". She sometimes gets mad at <span>Hiro</span> because of his treatment of Tohru. Kisa likes Hiro and is hurt when he withdraws from her to protect her from <span>Akito</span>,much like Hatsuharu is hurt by <span>Rin</span>.As the series progresses, Kisa is shown struggling with her shyness, and feels it is a major accomplishment to greet <span>Kyo</span> directly, instead of relying on Hiro to speak for her. Kisa likes omelets and but not dry foods, and is a fan of a fictional <span>anime</span> series <em>Mogeta</em>. She is called Sat-chan, using just the last syllable of her given name, by <span>Shigure</span>. Takaya derived her name from the second month, <span><span><strong>kisa</strong>ragi</span></span>or \"changing clothes month,\" which is the month of the tiger, of the traditional Japanese calendar.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Hiro Sohma</h2><br/><br/>Hiro Sohma, aged 11–12, is the sheep of the Chinese zodiac and the youngest of the cursed Sohmas. He depicted as a very intelligent but verbally aggressive and smart-mouthed sophist who is initially not very likeable. Several characters express intense irritation with him, but he escapes physical punishment by hiding behind being \"just a kid. Hiro is in love with Kisa and resents Tohru because she unwittingly monopolizes Kisa's time and admiration. His initial attitude toward Tohru eases through the series, through a combination of grudging admiration for Tohru, and being told to let up by Kisa and Hatsuharu, whom he admires. Hiro is frustrated that he is just a kid and desperately wants to grow up so he can protect Kisa, who was beaten by Akito after Hiro admitted he liked her, and later in the series he is shown struggling to restrain his tongue. He accidentally sees Akito push Rin out a window and knows about Rin's efforts to break the zodiac curse, though she forces him not tell Hatsuharu. Hiro is the only member of the zodiac who is shown having a close, loving relationship with both his parents, especially his mother, Satsuki. In Chapter 118, he is freed from the curse before most of the zodiac, and the first thing he does is hold his infant sister, Hinata, for the first time. Natsuki Takaya derived his name from the seventh month, fumihirogetsuki or \"month of publication,\" which is the month of the sheep, of the traditional Japanese calendar.",

    "description": "<h2>Hatori Sohma</h2><br/>Hatori Sohma, aged 27–28, is the dragon of the Chinese zodiac and, like his father before him, the private doctor to the Sohma family. He is responsible for erasing memories (using a form of hypnosis that is handed down in his line of the family)of those outsiders who discover the Sohma family secret, such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57673\" href=\"/yuki-sohma/4005-57673/\" slug=\"yuki-sohma\">Yuki</a>'s childhood playmates.Hatori is depicted as a tall, somber man who is rarely amused by the antics of his best friends, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57672\" href=\"/shigure-sohma/4005-57672/\" slug=\"shigure-sohma\">Shigure</a> and Ayame. He is often the only one who can restrain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57723\" href=\"/ayame-sohma/4005-57723/\" slug=\"ayame-sohma\">Ayame</a>'s worst behavior,and is the only person Shigure trusts enough to talk about his schemes. He takes his duties to the Sohma family and as a doctor seriously, and warns Tohru about the dangers of getting too involved with the family.In an author's note, Natsuki Takaya described him as \"the best marriage material of the cast.\"When his curse activates, Hatori transforms into a 8 cm long seahorse (in Japanese tatsuno-otoshigo, literally \"baby dragon\") rather than an actual dragon, which he is self-conscious about.According to Shigure, this is a sign the zodiac curse has weakened.<br/><br/>A few years before the series began, he was engaged to Kana Sohma, the assistant in his doctor's office.The relationship ended when Hatori asked Akito for permission to marry Kana and in response, Akito attacked Hatori (in the anime, she threw a vase), leaving him almost blind in his left eye; Kana blamed herself for the incident and felt so guilty about it that Hatori was forced to erase her memory of their relationship to ease her suffering.When Tohru meets up with him near the end of Volume 2, he looks back with his time with Kana, then says his heart is like snow. After Kana marries someone else, Shigure manipulates Hatori into meeting Kana's best friend, Mayuko Shiraki, who secretly had always liked him.In the last chapter, Hatori invites Mayuko on a Okinawa vacation.Takaya derived Hatori's name from the fourth month, konohatorizuki or \"month of taking leaves [to silkworms],\" which is the month of the dragon, of the traditional Japanese calendar.",

    "description": "<h2>Momiji Sohma</h2><br/>Momiji Sohma, aged 15–17, is the rabbit of the Chinese zodiac. His father, one of the richer members of the Sohma family, is Japanese, while his mother is German (they speak German and Japanese in the manga, but only Japanese in the anime). Momiji is depicted as a cute, cheerful boy who hides a sad family life behind his sunny demeanor. In an author's note, Takaya described him as \"the most comfortable\" of the Sohmas with his spirit possession, and \"the most successful of the boys.\"Momiji is an androgynous boy who is older than he appears, and Tohru is surprised to learn he is only a year younger than her. To <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57722\" href=\"/kyo-sohma/4005-57722/\" slug=\"kyo-sohma\">Kyo</a>'s horror, Momiji wears the girl's version of their high school uniform with shorts instead of a skirt,until he has a growth spurt at the start of his second year and swiches to the boy's uniform.He lives alone inside the Sohma family compound, and was raised by servants.His mother learned about the zodiac curse when she first held him, just after he was born, and was repulsed; she later had Hatori erase her memory that Momiji is her son.Because of this, his younger sister, Momo, is unaware he is her older brother,even though she is interested in him.Despite his upbringing, Momiji is insightful about others and emotionally strong. In chapter 115, his curse is broken before the rest of the zodiac, and he decides to leave Akito despite the latter's pleading.Momiji took to Tohru very quickly, even hugging her when they were formally introduced despite his curse. He sometimes helps Tohru at her evening job as an office cleaner in one of his father's buildings, and once substitutes for her when she is sick with a cold.He is very fond of Tohru, and even defies Akito to protect her. He later warns Kyo that if he does not act on his feelings for Tohru, someone else, such as himself, might steal her away;in the final chapter, Momiji tells Hatsuharu and Rin that he hopes to find a girlfriend as wonderful as Tohru.Takaya derived his name from the ninth month of the traditional Japanese calendar, momijitsuki or \"autumn leaves month\"; he was supposed to have been named after the third month, the month of the rabbit, but according to the author, she mixed up his and Kureno's positions in the zodiac.",

    "description": "<h2>Kagura Sohma</h2><br/><br/>Kagura Sohma, aged 18–20, is the boar of the Chinese zodiac. She is depicted as a girlish young woman with great strength, and the impulsive behavior associated with those born in her zodiac year.The latter usually takes the form of berating and beating up <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57722\" href=\"/kyo-sohma/4005-57722/\" slug=\"kyo-sohma\">Kyo</a>, who she insists is engaged to her. When Kagura was seven and Kyo was five, when he was all alone because he carried the curse of the cat, she played with him,and one day threatened him into proposing to her (using a knife in the manga, a boulder in the anime). After having the nature of her love questioned by Rin Sohma, Kagura eventually admits to Kyo that her love was based on pity,much as Kazuma fears Tohru's is,and that she has clung to him because, compared to the cat, she has it easy.After Kyo tells her he cannot love her, she claims to give up hope of winning him,but still loves and cares for him;when Tohru admits to Rin Sohma that she loves Kyo, Kagura impulsively strikes her, saying that the one to tell that to is Kyo himself. According to an author's note, Kagura is an \"older sister type who's always ready to help.\"She attends a local college while living with her parents, who are shown taking her double-edged personality in stride, and Rin. Kagura is the only female member of the zodiac who is not shown to have been injured by Akito. Takaya derived her name from the eleventh month, kagurazuki or \"month of Shinto song and dance,\" which is the month of the boar, of the traditional Japanese calendar.",

    "description": "<h2>The Ox</h2><br/>Hatsuharu Sohma, aged 15–17, often called Haru, is the ox of the Chinese zodiac. Hatsuharu is depicted as having something of a Yin and Yang personality related to the ox's traditional personality:He is usually calm, placid, and otherwise an all-around nice guy, but can be goaded into \"stampeding,\" a state in which he is edgy and mean. The Sohmas call these two sides of his personality his \"white\" and \"black\" sides; his hair is white with black roots, and his zodiac form is a black-and-white spotted cow.Because of the story of how the first rat tricked the first ox to become first in the zodiac, when Hatsuharu was a child he blamed Yuki Sohma, the current rat, for his reputation of stupidity, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57673\" href=\"/yuki-sohma/4005-57673/\" slug=\"yuki-sohma\">Yuki</a> helped him realize that Haru was not at fault for the ox's actions. Since then, Haru has claimed that Yuki was his first love. Hatsuharu is in love with Rin Sohma and has an on-again/off-again secret relationship with her. He is protective of those he cares about, especially Rin, Yuki, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57725\" href=\"/kisa-sohma/4005-57725/\" slug=\"kisa-sohma\">Kisa</a>, and once confronts and almost strikes Akito for confining Rin,and looked for Kisa when she ran away from home. Hatsuharu has a bad sense of direction, and once becomes lost for three days in another town while looking for Kyo in order to challenge him.He likes to tease Kyo in a dead-pan way. He is usually shown wearing various accessories, which, according to an author's note, he makes himself.He is referred to by Kyo as \"downright lewd\" when he says that Momiji should wear the girls uniform. Natsuki Takaya derived his name from the first month, hatsuharu meaning \"new year\" or \"early spring,\" which is the month of the ox, of the traditional Japanese calendar,though his name is written with different kanji than the month.",

    "description": "<h2>The Monkey</h2><br/>Ritsu Sohma, aged 21–22, is the monkey of the Chinese zodiac. He is depicted as a beautiful but unstable young man with very low self-esteem and a tendency to overreact. He apologizes frantically for everything, even things that are not his fault.In this, he takes after his mother,the hostess of the Sohma family's onsen,whose position he is in training to take over.Ritsu dresses in women's clothing because he says he then feels less pressure from society, and is initially mistaken for a woman by Tohru Honda because of his long hair and beauty.Most Sohmas call him \"Rit-chan\" and, to Shigure's amusement, Tohru calls him \"Rit-chan-san\". <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57672\" href=\"/shigure-sohma/4005-57672/\" slug=\"shigure-sohma\">Shigure </a>likes to play with Ritsu's insecurities and gullibility, much as he does his editor, Mitsuru; when the two meet, they realize they have this in common.In the final chapter of the manga, Ritsu tells <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57730\" href=\"/kagura-sohma/4005-57730/\" slug=\"kagura-sohma\">Kagura</a>, while giving her one of his women's kimonos, that he has asked Mitsuru on a date,and in a bonus story in the first fan-book, he and Mitsuru are a couple.Natsuki Takaya derived his name from the eighth month, odakaritsuki or \"rice harvest month,\" which is the month of the monkey, of the traditional Japanese calendar.In an author's note, Takaya said that she regretted how little role Ritsu played in the main story.",

    "deck": "Rin is a member of the Sohma Family who transforms into the horse of the Chinese Zodias after being hugged by a man. She is also linked to Hatsuharu Sohma.",
    "description": "<h2>The Horse</h2><br/><br/>Isuzu Sohma , aged 17–19, is the horse of the Chinese zodiac. She only appears in the manga. She is often called Rin because that is an alternate reading of 鈴, the second kanji of her given name. She is tall, busty, and initially has hip-length dark hair, which is later cut off; in an author's note, Natsuki Takaya described her as \"the character in charge of sexiness.\" She is depicted as stubborn and independent,to the point she cannot stand being dependent on someone else,traits associated with those born in her zodiac year; she is also sharp-tongued but concerned about others. When Rin was young her parents acted affectionate and devoted to her, unlike the parents of many cursed Sohmas, but when she asked if they were happy, the strain of pretending for her benefit shattered the facade, after which they neglected and abused her to the point she was hospitalized. After this her parents kicked her out and Rin moved into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57730\" href=\"/kagura-sohma/4005-57730/\" slug=\"kagura-sohma\">Kagura</a> Sohma's home.Rin and Hatsuharu have a sexual relationship that began before the start of the series. When Akito finds out about it, Rin claims full responsibility to protect Hatsuharu, and to punish her Akito pushes Rin out a window; while recouperating in the hospital, Rin breaks up with Hatsuharu to protect him but without explaining why.Rin starts searching for a way to break the curse, and asks Kazuma,Shigure,and Ren Sohma for help, though she resists the assistance of Tohru Honda, who she thinks is annoying and too nice to others than is good for herself.To punish Rin's meddling, Akito confines her in the cat's prison;after she is released by Kureno, she reconciles with Hatsuharu,accepting his support. She also accepts Tohru's assistance, because of her kindness,and grows as protective of her as of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57731\" href=\"/hatsuharu-sohma/4005-57731/\" slug=\"hatsuharu-sohma\">Hatsuharu</a>, and gets angry when someone upsets or hurts her. After the zodiac curse is broken, Rin cannot understand how others can move on as if Akito's abuse never happened,and in the final chapter she says she still gets angry.Takaya derived her name from the sixth month, isuzukuretsuki or \"month of the last cool spring days,\" which is the month of the horse, of the traditional Japanese calendar.",

    "description": "<h2>Kureno Sohma</h2><br/><br/>Kureno Sohma, aged 26–27, is the former rooster of the Chinese zodiac. He appears only in the manga. According to Natsuki Takaya, while he was still cursed, he did not like others to see his animal form, which was a sparrow instead of a rooster.He is depicted as a polite and selfless young man. Arisa Uotani describes Kureno as \"like Tohru\" because of his over-the-top politeness and scatterbrained idiosyncrasies,and Saki Hanajima compares his selflessness to Tohru's.Some members of the Sohma family describe Kureno as \"broken-in\".In his mid-teens, about ten years before the series begins, Kureno's curse was somehow broken, but in Akito's distress he promised never to leave.Kureno and Akito have a sexual relationship, and when Shigure learned about it, some time before the start of the series, in retaliation he slept with Akito's mother, Ren.Akito keeps Kureno away from the rest of the family to hide that he is no longer cursed, and Kureno does most of Akito's work as the head of the family. As a result, Kureno is so sheltered he is 26 when he first visits a convenience store, where he meets Arisa.Despite their mutual attraction, he stays away from her because, he claims to Tohru, of his promise to Akito.However, when Akito locks Rin Sohma away for stealing his father's box, it is Kureno who frees her.As the zodiac curse begins breaking down, Kureno eventually admits he is partially responsible for keeping Akito coddled and fearful by being too obedient, and Akito angrily stabs him in the back.When Kureno is released from the hospital, he moves out of the Sohma compound with Arisa's help,and in the final chapter, Arisa is preparing to move in with him.Takaya derived his name from the third month of the traditional Japanese calendar, kurenoharu or \"late spring\";he was supposed to have been named after the ninth month, the month of the rooster, but according to the author, she mixed up his and Momiji's positions in the zodiac.",

    "description": "<h2>Kazuma Sohma</h2><br/><br/>Kazuma Sohma is a master of martial arts who runs a dojo near the Sohma family compound, where he teaches several of the younger Sohmas, including Kyo, Kagura, Yuki, and Hatsuharu. He is usually addressed as shishou, meaning \"master.\" In an author's note, Takaya said that although she draws him young, his age is \"almost 40.\"Takaya also claimed he is \"clumsy with his hands and has no sense of flavor,\"and he is depicted as being so bad at cooking, he does not know how to prepare tea.His daily routine is taken care of by his assistant at the dojo, Kunimitsu Tomoda.<br/><br/>When he was a child, during their only meeting, Kazuma was mean to his grandfather simply because his grandfather was cursed by the cat. To make amends, after Kyo's mother died, he took in and raised Kyo, the current cat, as his foster son, and has come to think of him as his own son.Kazuma thinks well of Tohru and hopes her love for Kyo is sincere, and not based on pity like his grandmother's was towards his grandfather;both to test Tohru's feelings and to show Kyo he can be accepted despite his curse, Kazuma forces Kyo to show Tohru his true form.After Rin is hospitalized the second time during the series, he takes her in to recouperate so that she does not have to live inside the family compound, which he has done before.In the final chapter, Saki Hanajima is working at Kazuma's dojo and it is implied they are in a relationship.",

    "description": "<h2>Akito</h2><br/><br/>Akito plays an antagonistic role in the anime. Akito was first mentioned in episode two of the anime, in which Yuki told Tohru (whom had just discovered the family's secret curse) that when he was a child, there had been a similar incident in which people found out about the curse. He'd been playing with a group of children, and one of the young girls had hugged him, turning him into the rat. Upon remembering this, Yuki also recalled a young Akito telling him that his friends' memories had to be erased, because a boy turning into a rat was unnatural and needed to be hidden. Meanwhile, in the same episode, Akito was informed by Shigure that Tohru had discovered their curse. Akito replied that he would trust Tohru, citing that it might be \"a great opportunity\" for Yuki, Kyo, and himself. Later, when Shigure told Tohru that Akito had allowed her to keep her memories, and to live with them, so long as she kept their secret, Yuki became suspicious. He voiced his concern that Akito might be intending to use all of them for something. Shigure, however, brushed this theory off, saying to trust Akito to do what's best. Shigure also mentioned that it was Akito's decision for Kyo to live with them in his house, as well.<br/><br/>Akito was next mentioned in episode seven. In the episode, Hatori Sohma and Momiji Sohma visited Tohru, Yuki, and Kyo's school for the cultural festival. Hatori mentioned that Akito had wanted to go himself, but couldn't, because he was sick with a fever. Hatori also managed to trick Yuki and Kyo into smiling for a picture, saying that Akito had asked him to snap one for him. (The questions were: What's 1 2, in the English manga, what's 1 1 in the Japanese manga and anime and what's the last letter of the alphabet, in the English anime.)<br/><br/>In episode eight, Tohru visited the Sohma estate for the first time. She learned from Hatori that Akito suffered from frequent illnesses, and thus, he required much of Hatori's time as a doctor. During her visit, Hatori also recalled the time he'd fallen in love with a co-worker of his (Kana) when he and Kana went before Akito to request permission to marry, Akito became so enraged that he slapped a vase to the floor, the shards of which pierced one of Hatori's eyes on accident. Akito then blamed Kana for Hatori's injury; this caused Kana a lot of emotional distress and she thus became quite ill. Akito eventually convinced Hatori to end Kana's suffering by erasing all of her memories of their time together. Whilst Hatori remembered all of this in private, Momiji also relayed some of the same chilling tale to Tohru. Shortly after, Shigure appeared for a visit to the Sohma estate and later, took Tohru home. On their way out of the estate, however, Tohru caught a glimpse of Akito hanging out of a window ledge, watching her. She briefly wondered if whom she saw was, indeed, the mysterious head of the family, when Shigure interrupted her thoughts, telling her to keep up or she might get lost.<br/><br/>In episode nine, both Yuki and Kyo skipped out on the Sohmas' New Years banquet, opting instead to spend the holiday with Tohru. Shigure was the one to inform Akito of this, whom silently seethed at the announcement.<br/><br/>In episode 13, Akito made his official début in the series by visiting Yuki, Kyo, and Tohru's school on the opening ceremony day. Tohru ran into him while she was alone on the school's grounds, and was pleasantly surprised at the way Akito appeared very friendly and nice, even going so far as to call her \"cute.\" Akito claimed that he was quite shy, and thus didn't introduce himself before when he was caught watching her in the Sohma estate (episode eight); he then requested that he and Tohru become friends. Suddenly, it dawned upon Tohru that Akito's eyes were quite cold and hate-filled, and that his air of politeness was surely an act. Yuki, however, interrupted the pair before anyone could say anything more. He demanded to know what Akito did to Tohru whilst they were alone; Akito replied that he did absolutely nothing except introduce himself. Akito then quietly asked Yuki why he had skipped out on the New Years banquet; Akito threatened to lock him back up in the small, dark room that he kept especially for him. Yuki then had a flashback to his childhood (which was an added scene of the anime). In the flashback, he recalled a young Akito entering the dark room Yuki was confined to, shouting that he was the head of the family and was thus to be obeyed; Yuki also recalled the trauma of Akito physically beating him with a little whip, despite Yuki's pleas to stop. Remembering this horrible period of his life, Yuki became visibly upset, and Tohru quickly interrupted, pushing Akito away from him. Later in the episode, Shigure told Hatori that on their way home from the school, Akito commented on how \"ugly\" and \"dumb\" he believed Tohru to be, vowing that Yuki would soon return to him, because Yuki obviously still feared him.<br/><br/>In episode 21, it was revealed that when Hiro Sohma told Akito that he was in love with Kisa Sohma, Akito—upon glimpsing the two together in the hallway—slapped and pushed Kisa down to the floor.<br/><br/>In episode 24, a confrontation between Kazuma Sohma (Kyo's adoptive father) and Akito took place (exclusive only to the anime). In the scene, Kazuma had just returned home from his long journey into the mountains; he visited Akito, saying that \"things\" had gone well since he'd first left. Akito asked, \"Don't you think it's time? Time that we revealed that freak cat's true form?\" Kazuma gravely agreed. Smirking, Akito wondered aloud what Tohru would do when she sees Kyo's true form; he went onto imagine how Tohru would break down, not being able to stand the horror of the cat, and would most likely never set foot in Shigure's house again. Akito then mused that such a thing would probably make Yuki very unhappy, as well.<br/><br/>In episode 25, Kyo remembered that when he was a child, Akito had seen his true form, and had commented on how ugly and sick smelling it was. In the episode, the anime also added an extra scene between Akito and Tohru. After Kyo ran off, and Tohru struggled after him, Akito appeared in the woods, walking toward Tohru. At first, he pretended to be caring, asking her if something was wrong, but quickly, he switched gears and mockingly asked Tohru what she really knew about the Sohmas, and if she actually understood what it meant to be cursed. Akito then told her that he only had a short time left to live and that nothing could change it (a revelation which never occurred in the manga); he went onto say, \"I alone carry the full weight of the Zodiac curse.\" Musing aloud, Akito wondered what it was that everyone expected of Tohru, asking her if they thought that she could save them somehow. Akito told Tohru that she deserved the pain she felt, warning her that he would make her regret ever getting involved with the Sohmas. However, just then Shigure appeared calling out to Akito, who chuckled and complained that thanks to Tohru, he was soaking wet from the rain. He then departed in the car that had been waiting for him near-by.<br/><br/>Episode 26 is the only episode in the series in which all of its events never occurred in the manga; it brings the anime to its conclusion. In the episode, when Tohru returned to Shigure's house with Kyo's cat form cradled in her arms, Akito was shown briefly looming over a hillside, before quickly leaving. The next morning, having recalled what Akito had said to her, Tohru informed Shigure over breakfast that she would like to go see Akito. Shigure then took Tohru outside and explained that Akito only had a short time left to live because he bore the \"core\" of the Zodiac curse. This, Shigure said, was decided at the time Akito was born, and despite what Tohru might have hoped, it could not be changed. All the Sohmas could do, he added, was live the way Akito told them to before his early demise. Shigure suggested that it would be best if Tohru steered clear of Akito. Tohru agreed, but the next day, somehow got Shigure, Yuki, and Kyo to take her the Main House for a visit.<br/><br/>When they met, Akito was lounging in his room. He asked Tohru what she came for, saying to speak her mind because he wouldn't grow angry; however, from the way he scratched his nails across the wooden floor, it was clear that he was quite angry and irritated. Tohru answered simply that she didn't know why she had come in the first place. Akito stood and suddenly grabbed hold of Tohru by her hair in a fit of rage. While Shigure and Yuki immediately tried to hold him back, Akito began yelling that Tohru in fact knew exactly what she wanted to say, but that she was just afraid to voice it. Akito declared that she wants to ask him if she can go on living with Shigure, Yuki, and Kyo, but that Akito himself would not allow it. He again vowed to make Tohru regret having anything to do with the Sohmas, also asking her if she truly thought that coming and kneeling before him would change anything. Then, addressing the Juunishi, he announced the no one could leave the Sohmas or go against the head of the family.<br/><br/>Akito then demanded that Tohru beg for forgiveness and promise that she'd never interfere with their family again. Surprisingly, though, Tohru began to cry and speak sympathetically, telling Akito that it must have been hard for him to be told, from the moment of his birth, that he was going to die. She went onto say that when Akito passed away, everyone—including herself—would be very sad. At that, Akito smirked and informed Tohru that everyone was able to live thanks to him, and that they all hoped he would die quickly. He also told her that he was born in order to die, and that it had been decided at the moment of his birth. When Tohru tearfully demanded why and who decided such a thing, Akito grew angry and blurted out, \"It's been decided! It's been decided! And they never even asked me!\" This sentiment seemed to surprise Shigure, Yuki, and Hatori.<br/><br/>Tohru, however, began to relate the story of how her mother died, saying that she hadn't wanted her to pass away, but had wished that she would be able to be a part of her life for a long time. Akito, growing more and more desperate, demanded that Hatori instantly erase Tohru's memories; Hatori, however, remained unresponsive. As Akito then ordered that Tohru cease her crying, Tohru continued to speak, saying that while she didn't know anything about their family's curse, she was very happy to have met all of them, including Akito. This seemed to simultaneously baffle and move Akito, whom remained quiet as Tohru expressed her wish to get to know Akito better, to learn how he felt, and what his likes and dislikes were. Tohru told him that the important thing at the moment was that he was alive. After a moment of silence, Akito let go of his tight grip on Tohru's hair, and smacked Shigure and Yuki to the floor, away from himself. He stared off contemplatively, and replied quietly, \"I don't know.\"<br/><br/>At the end of episode 26, Akito was last seen sitting on the outer walkway of his room in the gardens with a little white bird perched on his arm, commonly believed to be the animal form of Kureno Sohma, the rooster of the Zodiac, who transformed into a sparrow instead of a true rooster. Support for this varies within the fandom however, due to the fact that in the manga, Kureno was released from the curse more than ten years before the canon storyline began.<br/><br/><h2>Personality</h2>In the manga, Akito Sohma was born female, the child of Akira Sohma (then the head of the Sohma family) and Ren Sohma (a maid in the Main House); according to the Fruits Basket Character Book, her Western zodiac sign is Cancer, and her blood type is AB.<br/><br/>Akito's true gender is known only to the four eldest cursed Sohmas—Hatori, Shigure, Ayame, and Kureno—who, on the night of Akito's conception, had a dream in which the god-spirit of the Chinese Zodiac told the boys that she was coming to be amongst them, as was promised hundreds of years before (chapter 131). (According to the author, Natsuki Takaya, the birth of a child possessed of the god-spirit is a rare occurrence.[3])<br/><br/>Long before Akito was born, Ren demanded that Akito be raised male or else she wouldn't give birth to the child; Ren claimed that having a female heir would \"cause problems,\" though the more likely reason for raising Akito male (as Shigure pointed out in a chapter 115 flashback) was because of Ren's insecurity over not being first in Akira's heart, and her jealousy of her husband's great affection for their child. Fearing that Ren would actually abort the baby, Akira agreed to these terms. (Even so, in some flashbacks to Akito's childhood, as in chapters 115 and 117, Akito is depicted wearing a little girl's kimono, and Akira even called Akito a \"special girl\" within the same scene.)<br/><br/>When Akito was born, apparently the most excited one over the birth was Akira. Since Akito was revealed to be possessed by the god-spirit of the Chinese Zodiac (Akito uniformly refers to herself as God in the English-language translation; however, a more accurate translation would be Jade Emperor, who is both the leader of the Chinese Zodiac and the primary deity of the Taoist religion), Akira saw this as a sign that his relationship with Ren was \"special,\" and because of Akito's \"godliness,\" he and others in the inner circle lavished Akito with attention. Ren, however, was not glad over Akito's birth, and according to chapter 115 of the manga, refused to even hold Akito as a baby. In Akito's recollection of childhood, she says of Ren, \"Mother was cold-hearted, and her anger was always aimed at me. I hate her.\" (Chapter 117)<br/><br/>Sometime in Akito's childhood, Akira's illness took a turn for the worse. On his death-bed, he told the young Akito not to be afraid, adding that he would always be with her, even if she couldn't physically see him. Akira went onto confess that he had wanted Ren to be the happiest over Akito, because Akito was a \"special existence,\" and therefore she and Ren were special. After he passed away, when Ren found out that no one had come to get her when Akira had been dying, she yelled at the young Akito that she was an unwanted existence, and that she had only been a little toy to amuse Akira; Ren also added that, because Akira was dead, no one had any more need of her.<br/><br/>Akito countered these statements, telling her hysterical mother that her father had loved her; but because of Akira's parting words, even Akito herself doubted that Akira had loved her the most, fearing that she had \"lost\" to \"that woman\" (Ren). One of the elderly maids, wanting to comfort Akito, proceeded to give her an empty box, claiming that Akira's spirit was inside it, and that she had wanted only Akito to receive such a special gift. (The same maid later claimed, in chapter 117, that the box was of course empty, and only given to Akito to help her through such a stressful time, adding that Akito should have well known that her father's spirit wasn't really inside the box.) All of her life, Akito kept this box hidden away in her room; she told Kureno in chapter 117 that part of her didn't believe that anything was inside of the box, yet another part always hoped that maybe there was.<br/><br/>After her father's early death, Akito became the head of the Sohma family (raised to appear and act as a male), in addition to her role as God of the Zodiac animals.<br/><br/>According to an interview with Natsuki Takaya, Akito was enrolled in \"better\" and \"more expensive\" schools than everyone else in the Zodiac, though she completed all of his schooling (including high school) by correspondence<br/><br/>For the first two volumes of the series, Akito is only mentioned in conversations by the Sohma family, or in brief flashbacks, all of which give a vague, foreboding image of the mysterious \"head of the family.\" (For example, in chapter two, Yuki recalls Akito telling him as a child that if anyone ever found out he turned into a rat, they'd think he was a freak and abandon him.) Also mentioned several times in the first two volumes is that no one in the Sohma family—specifically, the Juunishi—can go against any of Akito's orders. It is later revealed in volume 11 that Akito is possessed of the Zodiac's god-spirit, and therefore, all the cursed Sohmas have to obey her every word, no matter what.<br/><br/>Ever since chapter two, it had been hinted at that both Akito and Shigure were scheming something that involved Tohru, which was why she was allowed to keep her memories and live with the Sohmas. While it was eventually revealed that Akito and Shigure had different, separate reasons for allowing Tohru to grow closer to the Sohmas, Akito's own motive was fully explained in chapter 117. A while before the beginning of the manga's time-line, Yuki had left the Main House to live with Shigure. At that time, Akito's mother, Ren, commented that it seemed as if everyone was abandoning her, just like she had always predicted they would. Akito denied this, arguing that the Juunishi would come back to her in the end, since they were all connected by the inseparable Zodiac bonds. Ren, however, challenged Akito to prove this, saying that if Akito allowed the Juunishi to stray and to form other bonds with \"outsiders,\" and they abandoned her, then Akito would have to bow down before Ren and leave the Sohmas forever; on the other hand, if the Juunishi still returned to Akito's side after going out into the world, then Akito would win. Soon after this bet was made, Shigure approached Akito about allowing Tohru stay with him, Yuki, and Kyo. Akito, confident that she would win against Ren, consented to this. Since Akito believed that the world was a cruel, bleak place in which unconditional love did not exist outside of the Zodiac bonds, she also believed that Tohru would eventually end up rejecting the Juunishi; thus, she was certain that Yuki and the others would end up heart-broken by the world, and would return to her side forever.<br/><br/>In chapter 10, when Tohru visits the Sohma estate for the first time, she learned from Momiji that Hatori was nearly blind in his left eye, because years before, he had asked Akito permission to marry a woman he loved, Kana; Akito had flown into a frenzy of rage, accidentally injuring Hatori's eye, and blaming it on Kana, who never recovered from the shock of the accident; instead, Kana accepted Akito's blame and guiltily agonized over the incident, growing ill, until Akito convinced Hatori to erase Kana's memories of her love for him. In chapter 97, it is made clear that Akito reacted so horribly to the idea of being \"replaced\" in Hatori's heart at the time because, when she was a child, Kureno's curse/bond had broken for unknown reasons. Since that day, Akito—fearing that allowing any of the Juunishi to form \"other bonds\" with outsiders would break the rest of the curse and bonds—kept the Juunishi on a tight leash, and instilled in them doubt and self-hatred to make certain that they would never leave her. (In one of Yuki's childhood flashbacks in chapter 84, he remembered the day when Akito first \"snapped,\" painted the walls of his room black, and locked Yuki away in a dark room. It is assumed, from further flashbacks of Kureno's in chapter 97, that Akito's mini-mental breakdown was a result of his curse breaking around the same time.)<br/><br/>Tohru first caught a glimpse of Akito watching her from a window in chapter 10; however, it is not until chapter 20 that Akito first made her official debut in the manga. Akito visited Tohru, Kyo, and Yuki's school for the day, and approached Tohru alone; she called Tohru \"a cute girl\" and kindly asked her to take good care of her family. At first, Tohru was shocked at Akito's friendly attitude and sunny smile, wondering if she was meeting the same person who'd almost blinded Hatori. However, Tohru soon realized that Akito's polite air was an act, as Akito's eyes belied her. thinly-veiled hatred. When Yuki later appeared, Akito chastised him for skipping the family's New Years banquet, and threatened to lock Yuki away in the dark room of his childhood again to teach him a lesson. Tohru, sensing Yuki's fear, physically pushed Akito away, who, although quite shocked, left soon after without much of a fuss. As Shigure later relayed to Hatori that, on the car ride home, Akito spoke of how \"ugly\" and less-than-clever Tohru was, boasting that Yuki would surely come back to her in the end.<br/><br/>In chapter 120, it was revealed that Akito had always been lonely and afraid of change. The reason that she clung so desperately to the Juunishi bonds was that she feared that, without them, she would be all alone, and her existence meaningless, just as her mother had always claimed. This revelation occurred after both Momiji's and Hiro's curses broke. With the bonds falling apart, Akito—after having wrongfully stabbed Kureno in the back—ran away from the Sohma estate, wondering if everything really was all her fault, and why her world was collapsing so suddenly. Desperate and looking for someone to blame, Akito suddenly realizes that the Juunishi had been slowly but surely leaving ever since Tohru had appeared in their lives. Akito then walks to Shigure's home and finds Tohru alone outside. Akito comments that Tohru must be happy, because she had \"won\" and had, in the process, destroyed the only life she had known. Akito then threatens Tohru with a knife; but Tohru, realizing how both she and Akito had been trying to hold onto an \"unchanging\" reality (Akito clinging to the eternal bonds of the Zodiac; Tohru wanting her mother to always be first in her heart), told Akito that she understood how scary it is to be alone, and instead offered her hand in friendship. Before Akito could accept, the unstable cliff ground collapsed and Tohru fell, while Akito screamed for help. (In the first volume of the series, just after a landslide destroyed Tohru's tent, Shigure warned her that the ground around the area was unstable and due to collapse again one day.)<br/><br/>When Tohru (who recovered at the hospital) was finally allowed visitors beyond her immediate family, Akito was surprisingly one of the first to visit (and even more surprisingly, according to Hatori and Shigure, she went alone and entirely on her own accord). Fearful that she would be rejected by Tohru and Kureno (both of whom she'd hurt, emotionally and physically), Akito was told a comforting story by Momiji, who also offered advice that made it possible for Akito to see Tohru and Kureno for who they really are: People whose kindness for others overrides their ability to be concerned about themselves. With that in mind, she finally went to see Tohru, who offered her hand (despite the fact her arm is injured) to Akito in friendship again, which she accepted with a small smile. Akito also visited Kureno in the hospital, whom she had stabbed in the back (chapter 118); Kureno, however, didn't blame Akito for her actions, and forgave her when Akito cried and apologized to him repeatedly for smothering him all of the years she'd kept him close. From there on out, Akito decided to try to change rather than cling to being \"God,\" and to the memory of her father and what he had wanted her to be (chapter 132).<br/><br/>Towards the end of the manga, after Kureno left to live in the country with Arisa Uotani, and the curse was broken, Akito and Shigure finally confessed their true feelings for each other and reconciled. Akito begins living and dressing as a woman, and in her last meeting with all the formerly cursed Sohmas, she wore a furisode (female kimono), and donned a flower in her hair, something that shocked the younger Sohmas, who had just learned of Akito's true gender.<br/><br/>In the last chapter of the manga, Akito had let her hair grow a little past her shoulders, and wore a dress (chapter 136).<br/><br/>",

    "description": "<h2>Powers</h2> Kirby has the ability to inhale objects or enemies .  If an enemy with a unique power is inhaled, Kirby can swallow the enemy and steal its power.  Inhaled enemies and objects can also be spit back out to deal damage. mini-bosses  can be inhaled after they are defeated.  In Kirby Super Stars , Kirby can substitute his current power for an ally version of the swallowed enemy who would be controlled by the computer or the second player.  In Kirby: The Crystal Shards , Kirby could turn his power into a crystal.  The crystal could be thrown at enemies to make a combination crystal which Kirby could inhale to get a combination power.  In Kirby Squeak Squad, Kirby would encounter powers contained in bubbles.  These powers could be stored in Kirby’s stomach (the DS’s touch screen).  The player could use the touch screen to drag one power to another to combine powers.  Kirby can also fly by filling himself with air and flapping his stubby arms.  <br /><br /><h3> </h3><h2>List of Kirby’s Inhale Abilities:</h2> <p><b> Animal</b> - Kirby wears an animal fur.  Kirby attacks with a slash attack.  Kirby can dig through dirt.</p> <p><b> Beam-</b> Kirby wears a jester hat.  Kirby attacks by whipping out an electric chain.</p> <p><b> Bomb-</b> Kirby wears a blue Santa hat.  Kirby can throw bombs  or set bombs down on the ground.</p> <p><b> Bubble-</b> Kirby has a crown of bubbles.  Kirby attacks with a bubble wand that shoots bubbles.  The bubbles turn enemies into abilities inside bubbles.</p> <p><b> Fireball-</b> Kirby has a crown of  flames and flames on his arms. <b>  </b>Kirby turns into a fast moving ball of flame.  Can break metal blocks.</p> <p><b> Cook</b> - Kirby wears a chef's hat .  Kirby takes out a pot, and all enemies on screen jump in and are turned into  food.  Can only be used once.  <br /><br /><b>Copy</b> - Kirby wears a high-tech visor.  He sends out a short-range scanning beam that will automatically copy the ability of any enemy it touches for Kirby to use. (If the enemy has no ability to copy, the beam simply destroys them.)  <br /><br /><b>Crash</b> - Kirby flashes white.  He turns himself into a smart bomb that destroys every enemy on the screen.  One time use.<br /></p> <p><b> Cupid-</b> Kirby has a halo and angel wings.  Kirby shoots and arrow that can be charged up.  Kirby can hover.</p> <p><b> Cutter-</b> Kirby wears a helmet with horns.  Kirby attacks using boomerangs.  Only 2 boomerangs can be thrown at a time.  Can cut strings.</p> <p><b> Fighter-</b> Kirby wears a red  headband.  Kirby attacks using various fighting moves, including jabs,  uppercuts, and a charged projectile.</p> <p><b> Fire-</b> Kirby wears a crown of fire.  Kirby attacks by breathing fire.  The fire can melt ice or metal.</p> <p><b> Ghost-</b> Kirby wears a sheet with eye holes.  Kirby attacks by rushing into enemies and possessing them.  The player can then control the enemy or release it.</p> <p><b> Hammer-</b> Kirby holds a hammer.  Kirby attacks by swinging the hammer.  He can also throw the hammer for a powerful ranged attack, but he gives up the ability by doing so.  Can break metal blocks.  Can be used underwater.  Can hit pegs.</p> <p><b> Hi-Jump-</b> Kirby wears a cape.  Kirby attacks by jumping high and landing with a shockwave.</p> <p><b> Ice-</b> Kirby wears a crown of ice crystals.  Kirby attacks by breathing ice, turning enemies into ice cubes which can be kicked.  The ice can freeze water or lava.</p> <p><b> Laser-</b> Kirby wears an eye gadget.  Kirby attacks with a laser  that bounces off walls.</p> <p><b> Magic-</b> Kirby wears a magician’s top hat .  Kirby attacks by making doves appear, shooting playing cards  and making a jack-in-a-box appear.  The cards can cut strings.</p> <p><b> Master Hand-</b> Can only be obtained by beating and inhaling Master Hand.  Kirby can use the hammer, stone, a cutter attack and a punching attack.</p> <p><b> Metal-</b> Kirby becomes covered in metal.  Kirby cannot be damaged by regular enemies, but moves slower.  Kirby can turn into a ball, allowing him to roll down slopes.</p> <p><b> Mini-</b> Kirby becomes tiny.  That’s it. <br /> <br /><b>Mirror</b> - Kirby wears a red and blue jester's cap.  He can attack by sending out a short-range stream of mirror shards with his wand, or by making a quick mirror image of himself.  Both techniques reflect enemy projectiles.  Can cut strings.<br /></p> <p><b> Missile-</b> Kirby has a target on the top of his head.  Kirby attacks by turning into a rocket that the player can guide .  Can break metal blocks. <br /> <br /><b>Mike</b> - Kirby goes through three different appearances: wearing headphones and yelling into a radio microphone, wearing a white cap and yelling into a megaphone, and wearing a mohawk and yelling into a rock concert mic.  Each instance has the same effect: Kirby yells so loudly that all enemies on the screen explode.  After the third use, this ability disappears.<br /></p> <p><b> Needle-</b> Kirby wears a spike cap.  Kirby attacks by encasing himself with spikes.</p> <p><b> Ninja-</b> Kirby wears a helmet with Japanese style hair.  Kirby can throw shuriken  or create an <u> explosion</u><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/explosion/92-309/\"> </a>.  Kirby can also walk on water and cling to walls.  The explosion changes to water type if Kirby is on water. <br /> <br /><b>Paint</b> - Kirby wears a gray cap backwards.  He grabs a paint bucket and paintbrush and fills the whole screen with colors, damaging every enemy on the screen.  Also used in the boss fight with Chameleo Arm in Kirby Super Star to counteract his camouflage.  One time use.<br /></p> <p><b> Parasol-</b> Kirby holds a parasol.  Kirby attacks by whacking people with the parasol.  He can also use the parasol to slow his descent in mid-air and to shield himself from the front.<br /></p> <p><b> Plasma-</b> Kirby wears a crown  of green electricity.  Kirby creates a circle of electric energy around him.  Can send electricity on certain surfaces.  He builds up power by quickly moving back and forth (a technique intended to replicate the act of building up static electricity by rubbing your feet against a carpet).<br /></p> <p><b> Sleep-</b> Kirby wears a sleeping cap.  Kirby cannot attack for a few seconds while he sleeps.  Sometimes sleeping will heal Kirby.<br /></p> <p><b> Stone-</b> Kirby wears a helmet that looks like the ninja cap.  Kirby can turn into a stone.  Can hit pegs.  <br /> <br /><b>Suplex- </b>Kirby wears a blue headband, and his skin tone turns slightly darker.  He can dash forward to grab objects or enemies, then toss or slam them in various ways like German suplexes and piledrivers.  It works very similarly to the <b>Throw</b> ability from Kirby's Adventure, but <b>Suplex</b> is the name given to this ability in Kirby Super Star.<br /></p> <p><b> Sword-</b> Kirby holds a sword .  Kirby attacks using sword slashes.  Can cut strings.  Can be used underwater.</p> <p><b> Throw-</b> Kirby wears a blue headband.  Kirby can suck enemies toward him, then throw them.  Can break metal blocks.</p> <p><b> Tornado-</b> Kirby has a crown of swirling air.  Kirby can turn into a tornado which the player can guide.</p> <p><b> UFO-</b> Kirby is in a UFO .  Kirby attacks using a charge laser, or the Beam power.  Kirby can hover.  Can be used underwater.</p> <p><b> Wheel-</b> Kirby wears a red cap.  Kirby attacks by turning into a wheel and rolling across the ground.  In <i>Kirby Squeak Squad</i>, if the wheel rolls onto ice or electricity, the element will change.  <br /> <br /><b>Wing</b> - Kirby wears Native American feathers on his head as well as some red facepaint.  He sends out small feathers as a weak projectile attack, but he can also perform powerful aerial diving attacks.  This ability also fundamentally changes the way Kirby's flight mechanics work: he gains more horizontal velocity and doesn't need to inhale before taking flight.<br /><br /><b>Yo-Yo</b> - Kirby wears a blue cap backwards.  He attacks by swinging a yo-yo and by breakdancing.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Marie is named after french chemist and Nobel Prize winner <a href=\"/marie-curie/4005-4135/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4135\"> Marie Curie</a>, or possibly after the infamous French queen Marie Antoinette.</p><p> Daughter of Dutchess, the cat owned by Madame Adelaide, Marie is the middle kitten and the only girl among her two brothers <a href=\"/toulouse/4005-57742/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57742\"> Toulouse</a> and <a href=\"/berlioz/4005-57743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57743\"> Berlioz</a>. She is a little bossy and thinks that she is the best, being the only girl. Being the pet of retired opera singer Madame Adelaide, Marie and her family live a very comfortable and luxurious life. One day, Madame Adelaide announces that she wants to pass her inheritance on to her four cats, and for Madame Adelaide's butler <a href=\"/edgar/4005-36111/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36111\">Edgar</a> to look after the cats until they die and then eventually inherit the money for himself. </p><p> </p><p>Edgar believes that he will be dead before he has the chance to inherit the fortune, and tries to get rid of Dutchess and her kittens. He drugs the cats with sleeping pills, and then goes to the countryside to get rid of them. The cats are then left in the countryside, and so they are made to fend for themselves. While being there, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens back to their home in Paris. </p><p> </p><p>On their return, the cats hitch a ride on the back of a milk cart but are then chased off by the driver. Marie subsequently falls into a river and is saved by O'Malley. O'Malley and Dutchess then fall in love, and Duchess is asked to marry Thomas. Marie likes the idea of having a father figure in her life however, Dutchess turns Thomas down out of loyalty to Madame Adelaide and her home. The cats then return to the mansion with the help of O'Malley, where Dutchess and the kittens have to say goodbye. </p><p> </p><p>Upon their return however, Edgar re-captures the cats and this time decides to ship them off to Timbuktu. O'Malley returns and saves Dutchess and the kittens, with the help of other alley cats. In the end, Edgar is instead locked into the trunk, and sent to Timbuktu instead. Madame Adelaide then re-writes her will, excluding Edgar and including O'Malley. O'Malley then marries Dutchess, and now lives with her and the kittens in Madame Adelaide's mansion.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Toulouse has blue eyes, and long orange fur with a lighter orange stomach. He wears a large blue ribbon around his neck. He is the oldest brother of  Marie and Berlioz. He is named after french painter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17432\" href=\"/toulouse-lautrec/4005-17432/\"> Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.<br /></a><br /> Being the pet of retired opera singer Madame Adelaide,Toulouse and his family live a very comfortable and luxurious life. One day, Madame Adelaide announces that she wants to pass her inheritance on to her four cats, and for Madame Adelaide's butler Edgar to look after the cats until they die and then eventually inherit the money for himself. <br /> <br />Edgar believes that he will be dead before he has the chance to inherit the fortune, and tries to get rid of Dutchess and her kittens. He drugs the cats with sleeping pills, and then goes to the countryside to get rid of them. The cats are then left in the countryside, and so they are made to fend for themselves. While being there, Duchess meets an alley cat named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57784\" href=\"/thomas-omalley/4005-57784/\">  Thomas O'Malley</a>, who offers to guide her and the kittens back to their home in Paris.  Toulouse is impressed, as he had always wanted to meet an alley cat.<br /> <br />On their return, the cats hitch a ride on the back of a milk cart but are then chased off by the driver. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57741\" href=\"/marie/4005-57741/\">  Marie</a> subsequently falls into a river and is saved by O'Malley. O'Malley and Dutchess then fall in love, and Duchess is asked to marry Thomas. Dutchess turns Thomas down out of loyalty to Madame Adelaide and her home. The cats then return to the mansion with the help of O'Malley, where Dutchess and the kittens have to say goodbye.  <br /> <br />Upon their return however, Edgar re-captures the cats and this time decides to ship them off to Timbuktu. O'Malley returns and saves Dutchess and the kittens, with the help of other alley cats. In the end, Edgar is instead locked into the trunk, and sent to Timbuktu instead. Madame Adelaide then re-writes her will, excluding Edgar and including O'Malley. O'Malley then marries Dutchess, and now lives with her and the kittens in Madame Adelaide's mansion. </p>",

    "deck": "The youngest kitten of Dutchess the cat, and owned by Madame Adelaide. One of the Aristocats.",
    "description": "<p>Berlioz has blue eyes, a small and skinny black furred body with a lighter grey stomach. He wears a small red ribbon around his neck. He is named after french composer Hector Berlioz.</p><p>Being the pet of retired opera singer Madame Adelaide, Beriloz and his family live a very comfortable and luxurious life. One day, Madame Adelaide announces that she wants to pass her inheritance on to her four cats, and for Madame Adelaide's butler Edgar to look after the cats until they die and then eventually inherit the money for himself. </p><p> Edgar believes that he will be dead before he has the chance to inherit the fortune, and tries to get rid of Dutchess and her kittens. He drugs the cats with sleeping pills, and then goes to the countryside to get rid of them. The cats are then left in the countryside, and so they are made to fend for themselves. While being there, Duchess meets an alley cat named <a href=\"/thomas-omalley/4005-57784/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57784\"> Thomas O'Malley</a>, who offers to guide her and the kittens back to their home in Paris. </p><p> On their return, the cats hitch a ride on the back of a milk cart but are then chased off by the driver. <a href=\"/marie/4005-57741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57741\"> Marie</a> subsequently falls into a river and is saved by O'Malley. O'Malley and Dutchess then fall in love, and Duchess is asked to marry Thomas. Dutchess turns Thomas down out of loyalty to Madame Adelaide and her home. The cats then return to the mansion with the help of O'Malley, where Dutchess and the kittens have to say goodbye. </p><p> </p><p>Upon their return however, Edgar re-captures the cats and this time decides to ship them off to Timbuktu. O'Malley returns and saves Dutchess and the kittens, with the help of other alley cats. In the end, Edgar is instead locked into the trunk, and sent to Timbuktu instead. Madame Adelaide then re-writes her will, excluding Edgar and including O'Malley. O'Malley then marries Dutchess, and now lives with her and the kittens in Madame Adelaide's mansion. </p>",

While initially only an adversary of the Huntress, his powers were greatly enhanced by a deal struck with the demon <a href=\"/neron/4005-2227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2227\">Neron</a> and fought against <a href=\"/guy-gardner/4005-1791/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\">Guy Gardner</a> Warrior team-mates after attacking a popular night-club.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Black Market</h3><p>Although born Herbert Hynde, he came to be known as Earthworm due to his appearance and ability to control vermin and alligators found within the sewer system. Already involved in various criminal activities, he was the mastermind behind the purchase of infants born to couples willing to give up their children to feed their drug addictions. Earthworm sold the children to childless couples in return for greater amounts of money to fund a group headed by <a href=\"/terry-marsh/4005-14324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14324\">Terry Marsh</a> who sought to have vigilantes like the Huntress destroyed. Interrupting a transaction in which a baby was being delivered to the Earthworm, the Huntress was able to track down Earthworm and dismantle the network needed to support his nefarious venture. Confronting him, the Huntress rescued another baby in his possession after battling alligators and rodents but unfortunately was unable to apprehend Earthworm due his ability to contort his body through a locked gate of bars nearby.</p><h3>Underworld Unleashed</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108959/2573757-guygardnerearthwormwiki.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573757\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5996204933586\" data-width=\"527\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 527px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:160.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108959/2573757-guygardnerearthwormwiki.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573757\"><img alt=\"Wormsicle\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108959/2573757-guygardnerearthwormwiki.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/108959/2573757-guygardnerearthwormwiki.png 527w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-width=\"600\"></a><figcaption>Wormsicle</figcaption></figure><p>In the New World Universe, Earthworm was part of the group of villains who took up the demon Neron on his offer to greatly enhance their powers at the expense of their souls. Working with <a href=\"/cheetah-minerva/4005-8344/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8344\">Cheetah</a> and <a href=\"/blackguard/4005-40815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40815\">Blackguard</a>, the trio attacked the popular Warrior nightclub and destroyed the establishment, Earthworm killing several patrons and employees to feed his hunger for \"surface-meat\". The clone of Guy Gardner was able to defeat both Cheetah and Blackguard but was unable to apprehend Earthworm who escaped to the sewers with several victims. The real Guy Gardner recovering elsewhere, team-mates <a href=\"/blockbuster/4005-8263/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8263\">Desmond</a>, <a href=\"/veronna/4005-2040/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2040\">Veronna</a> and <a href=\"/arisia/4005-2046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2046\">Arisia</a> arrived in Earthworm's underworld lair and were able to defeat Earthworm when Desmond transformed into the Black Tiger, allowing Arisia to cryogenically freeze the villain.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Earthworm is able to communicate and command sewer vermin, including extremely large alligators. He can slip through the smallest of spaces due to his thin and supple physiology and is able to see in the dark. After striking a deal with a demon, he became much more powerful, his body changing from lanky and thin to a larger and stronger physique.</p><h3> </h3><p>Height: 6' 4\"</p><p>Weight: 132 lbs (Earth 2) unknown (New Earth)</p><p>Eye Colour: Red</p><p>Hair Colour: Grey</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2>Years ago when Lady Emerald was still a princess, she and several other <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56625\" href=\"/gemworld/4020-56625/\" slug=\"gemworld\">Gemworld</a> nobles were spirited off to a limbo of the dead. Before they escaped, a demonic creature set a seal of enchantment upon the princess. Years later, as Lady Emerald, she suffered a series of personal tragedies, the last and harshest being the loss of her eldest daughter at the hands of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6594\" href=\"/dark-opal/4005-6594/\" slug=\"dark-opal\">Dark Opal</a>. These tragedies drove her mad. As the rebellion against the rule of Dark Opal escalated, the power of the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57234\" href=\"/house-of-emerald/4020-57234/\" slug=\"house-of-emerald\">House of Emerald</a> was needed to tip the balance in favor of the alliance led by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6579\" href=\"/amethyst/4005-6579/\" slug=\"amethyst\">Princess Amethyst</a>. But Lady Emerald was lost in her insanity. At last she was poisoned by her own vizier, for her death would transfer the power of the House to her oldest surviving <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76595\" href=\"/princess-emerald/4005-76595/\" slug=\"princess-emerald\">daughter</a>, who needed it in the battle against Opal. But her tale was not yet done. For, in the nameless limbo, her spirit was intercepted by the creature that had enchanted her long ago. That enchantment made her death different, less complete than most. Her spirit was desperate to return to life, and was encouraged by the little fiend, which had its own motives. The mystic power needed to revive her was so vast that it would require the destruction of the entire Gemworld, and yet her spirit sought that power. In the guise of <b>Fire Jade</b>, she, with the small demon masquerading as her familiar, attempted to undermine the magical underpinnings of Gemworld. At last Fire Jade was defeated by her middle daughter, Princess Emerald, and Amethyst. Fire Jade accepted her death, her fear passed, and after repairing the damage she had done, went peacefully with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32122\" href=\"/citrina/4005-32122/\" slug=\"citrina\">Citrina</a> to her death.",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Born on the slopes of Dragonmount, the son of an <a href=\"/aiel/4060-56461/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56461\">Aiel</a> chief and the daughter-heir of Andor. His mother died at his birth, and he was adopted by passing soldier <a href=\"/tam-althor/4005-31362/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31362\">Tam al'Thor</a>, who brought the child back to his village in the <a href=\"/two-rivers/4020-56274/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56274\">Two Rivers</a> and raised him as his own. Rand grew up alongside <a href=\"/matrim-cauthon/4005-31286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31286\">Mat Cauthon</a> and <a href=\"/perrin-aybara/4005-74471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74471\">Perrin Aybara</a>, with whom he remained best friends through adolescence. A raid on his farming village by Trollocs caused the injury of his father, and subsequently he learned that he was adopted. He left the town, alongside the mysterious <a href=\"/aes-sedai/4060-57985/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57985\">Aes Sedai</a> <a href=\"/moiraine-damodred/4005-28306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28306\">Moiraine Damodred</a>, her warder <a href=\"/allan-mandragoran/4005-24503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24503\">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>, and his two childhood friends, as well as <a href=\"/egwene-alvere/4005-23639/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23639\">Egwene al'Vere</a>, <a href=\"/nynaeve-almeara/4005-74469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74469\">Nynaeve al'Meara</a> and gleeman <a href=\"/thom-merrilin/4005-74470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74470\">Thom Merrilin</a>, in order to fulfill his destiny as the Dragon Reborn.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Rand was originally created by <a href=\"/robert-jordan/4040-28136/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-28136\">Robert Jordan</a> for his book series <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, making his first appearance in the first book of the series, <i>The Eye of the World</i>. He made his first comic appearance in <a href=\"/robert-jordans-the-wheel-of-time-dragonmount/4050-2597/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2597\">Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time: Dragonmount</a> #0, written by Jordan and <a href=\"/chuck-dixon/4040-41486/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41486\">Chuck Dixon</a>, and illustrated by <a href=\"/chase-conley/4040-35685/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-35685\">Chase Conley</a>. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Eye of the World </h3><p>Rand and his companions are driven from Emond's Field by an attack of the monstrous Trollocs, sent to kill him and his friends. They are pursued in their flight and seek refuge in the corrupted city of Shadar Logoth, where the group becomes separated. Rand, Mat and Thom make their way to Whitebridge, where Thom is apparently killed. Rand and Mat make their way to Caemlyn, evading attacks by Darkfriends and acting as gleeman. In Caemlyn, he falls into the palace gardens where he meets Elayne Trakand, the daughter-heir of Andor, her brothers Gawyn and Galad, and her mother, Queen Morgase of Andor. Though Morgase's advisor advises her that Rand is dangerous, she allows him to leave the palace. Soon after this he is reunited with the rest of his group, and they travel to an untainted well of Saidin, the male half of the One Power, which is under threat from members of the Forsaken. At the Eye of the World he battles one of the Forsaken and unintentionally channels the One Power, defeating two of the Forsaken and the legions of Trollocs. Moiraine reveals that he is the Dragon Reborn. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Rand is ta'veren, meaning that he twists the pattern around himself, generally unintentionally, manipulating probabilities and causing unlikely things to occur. Like Perrin, and unlike Mat, his twisting of the pattern has positive results in about equal measure to the negative results. His ta'veren nature often draws important people to him, and tends to win their loyalty, or at least forces them to submit to him. He is capable of channeling Saidin, the male half of the One Power. He is one of the most powerful channelers in the world, perhaps the most powerful since the death of <a href=\"/lews-therin-telamon/4005-35164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35164\">Lews Therin Telamon</a> some three thousand years previous. He has also been shown to be capable of channeling the True Power, the Dark One's version of the One Power. He is the reincarnation of Lews Therin, and hears the voice of the dead man in his head. He also has access to Lews Therin's memories, allowing him to instinctively create weaves of the power that have been lost for centuries. Rand is a gifted fighter who wields a heron-marked sword, marking him as a blademaster. He is also a skilled leader. </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Literature</h3><p><b><i>The Wheel of Time</i></b> </p><p>Rand was originally created for the <i>Wheel of Time</i> series of books. A major protagonist in the series, he has appeared in fourteen books. </p><h3>Games </h3><p>Rand appears in numerous game adaptations of the series, both online and offline.</p>",

However, after meeting up with his grandfather's regiment who was somehow alive, he was able to to change history in a reenactment into what it should have been.</p><h2>Life before Darkwing: Duck Tales</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Launchpad was formally Scrooge Mcduck's pilot. Launchpad calls him \"Mr. Mc-D\", a name only he can use. He once mentioned that he and Scrooge had been in over 101 crashes together, though that number might have increased triple that before he met Darkwing.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When they first met, Scrooge wanted to have a cheep pilot to fly him to the \"Thick-of-it Rain forest\". Scrooge chooses Launchpad because he only has to pay two cents (after a little smashing bardoring on Scrooge's part. Him and his *sticky* fingers...). Launchpad reveals it is his first job. True to form, Launchpad bungles landing and both pilot and passenger and plane gets sucked into a tunnel system and narrowly misses the earth's core. He manages to get the plane into an adjacent tunnel and, after traveling through that, fly into an underground world. He misses a boiling lake and produces his first crash. Boy was it a beauty.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After surviving their, first crash together, Scrooge and Launchpad meet a tribe of women warriors. It seems all the men had run away, perhaps for a good reason because the women apparently run away and a giant crab tries to eat them. The women return and attack the crab. It turns out the positions of men and women are switched (so the women do all the hunting and the men do all the cleaning and are the \"damsels in distress\").

    "description": "<p><b>Benjamin Washington</b>, also known as \"<b>Knox</b>\", was a criminal who was among the escapees from Level 5, and was eventually recruited intoPinehearst Company. He was an evolved human with the ability to feed off people's fear and turn it into his own incredible strength.</p><h3>The Second Coming</h3><p>While in Noah Bennet's house, Sylar, while stalking and hunting Claire throughout the house, finds a collection of evolved human files in one of Noah's boxes, one of which is on Knox. Sylar remarks the files are a \"shopping list\" of new abilities, and intends to take Knox's ability, as well as those of the other prisoners.</p><p>While in his cell, Knox, kept in a straitjacket, paces back and forth repeatedly.</p><h3>The Butterfly Effect</h3><p>When Sylar does arrive, Elle Bishop ends the battle by unleashing a massive discharge that blows out Level 5's power grid, releasing a dozen prisoners. Knox gathers some together, including Jesse Murphy (inhabited by Peter Petrelli), Eric Doyle, Flint and the German, and leads them to escape Primatech Research.</p><p>Much later, the group has arrived at a gas station, where Knox and the others take their time murdering the other tenants. Knox stops Peter from calling Nathan and directs him to the car the German secures for them. Knox then convinces \"Jesse\" to come with them and escape, as sirens approach.</p>",

    "deck": "A simple girl who got into the secrets of the Sohma Family and was trapped by its family controversies.",
    "description": "<h2>Tohru</h2><br/>Tohru is an orphaned high school student who, after meeting Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure Sohma, learns that thirteen members of the Sohma family are possessed by the animals of the Chinese zodiac and cursed to turn into their animal forms if they are embraced by anyone of the opposite sex or their bodies come under a great deal of stress.As the series progresses, Tohru meets the rest of the zodiac and the family's mysterious head, Akito Sohma, and eventually resolves to break the curse that burdens them.<br/><br/><h2>Personality</h2><br/><br/>Tohru is depicted as polite, optimistic, extremely kind, and selfless.Several other characters, including her friends <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57722\" href=\"/kyo-sohma/4005-57722/\" slug=\"kyo-sohma\">Kyo</a>,<a data-ref-id=\"4005-57733\" href=\"/rin-sohma/4005-57733/\" slug=\"rin-sohma\">Rin</a>,and Hanajima,tell her she needs to look out for her own interests and not shoulder everyone else's burdens. At the start of the series, she is living in a tent rather than staying with her friends, Arisa Uotani and Saki Hanajima, to avoid being a burden to them,and she has an after-school job as an office janitor to pay her tuition fees so that her grandfather does not have to.Yuki once describes her as not the sort who sees her life as a \"glass half-empty.\"Tohru is so kind-hearted that she cannot make herself say mean things while playing a wicked stepsister in a class production of Cinderella,and when her mother told her the bedtime story of how the cat was excluded from the Chinese zodiac, in sympathy she declared she wished to be born in the year of the cat.<br/>Tohru describes herself as an excellent housekeeper who loves to cook.In the original Japanese, Tohru habitually speaks formally (see Honorific speech in Japanese), but not always correctly. She picked up this habit from her dead father, Katsuya, after he died when she was three, as a way of replacing him in her mother's eyes.Tohru tends to be especially concerned for people with minor illness. This comes from the circumstances her father's death, when Katsuya was originally diagnosed with a fever but eventually died of pneumonia.<br/><br/><br/>She was raised by her mother, Kyoko, until Kyoko died in a car accident shortly after Tohru entered high school, a few months before the series start. Tohru treasures her mother's photograph and vowed at her death to keep Kyoko the most important person in her life.Tohru is distressed whenever she feels she is being \"unfaithful\" to her mother, for example, when she gets failing marks on end-of-term exams, thus endangering her promise to graduate high school, or when she falls in love with Kyo.Tohru eventually realizes that her vow is an attempt to cling to the past, and that Kyoko would have wanted her to move on and fall in love with someone else.<br/><br/><h2>History</h2><br/><br/>A few months before the series begins, Tohru's mother died in a car accident, leaving her an orphan in the care of her grandfather. When his house needs remodeling, she moves into a tent on land that turns out to belong to the house of Shigure Sohma. When her tent is buried in a landslide during a rainstorm, Shigure convinces her to move in with him and Yuki as housekeeper in exchange for room and board. As she settles in, Kyo Sohma arrives to challenge Yuki. In the confusion, Tohru accidentally embraces him and he transforms into a cat, and when she stumbles into Yuki and Shigure, they transform as well into a rat and dog, respectively. The Sohmas explain that their family is cursed, and they are possessed by spirits of the Chinese zodiac plus the cat legend says would have been if it had not been tricked by the rat into missing the induction feast. Tohru promises to keep their secret, under the threat of having her memories erased—a compromise agreed to by Akito Sohma, the mysterious head of the family, who orders Kyo live with Shigure as well.<br/>Tohru is soon friends with the three Sohmas—especially her classmates Yuki and Kyo, who she hopes will become friends themselves—and they in turn are slowly affected by her presence.Yuki is especially touched by Tohru's request that, if her memory is suppressed, he remain her friend,which no one had asked him before. Kyo initially appears to dislike Tohru, but he, like Yuki, is \"drawn\" to her kind heart and gentle demeanor. However, his inability to express his feelings results in frequent impulsive angry comments to Tohru, for which he usually ends up apologizing. Gradually Tohru meets the other cursed members of the Sohma family, and through her kindness and sympathy is able to help Hatori,Ayame,Kisa,Hiro, and Ritsu.Her encouragement to Kisa also helps Yuki face his own self-doubts and accept becoming president of the student council;in addition he knows, by a cap Tohru treasures,that she is the lost little girl he once led home, an act that showed him that he was not as unneeded by others as Akito claimed.Tohru becomes particularly close to Kyo after his foster-father Kazuma Sohma forces him to reveal the monstrous \"true form\" of his curse; although initially repulsed, Tohru stays with him even after he violently tries to push her away.Both Yuki and Kyo fall in love with her, though neither tells her.<br/><br/>As she learns more about the zodiac curse, Tohru becomes increasingly distressed by its cost to her friends—especially Momiji Sohma's separation from his little sister, Momo, who does not even know they are related, and her friend Arisa's longing for Kureno Sohma, who cannot see her because he is bound to Akito. When she learns that the feared Akito is the \"god\" of the zodiac and of the bet he made with Kyo, which could result in the cat being confined for life, she resolves to break the curse.Tohru asks for help from Kazuma, Rin,and Kureno.Despite setbacks and being warned off by Rin—who also seeks to break the curse, in order to free Hatsuharu—Tohru refuses to give up her goal.She eventually receives encouragement and hints from Shigure,who is using Tohru to weaken the curse for his own reasons.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Tohru's feelings for Kyo develop and she eventually admits he is the Sohma she wants the most to free, because she loves him.This, however, only distresses her further, as she feels she is being unfaithful to her mother's memory. However, when Tohru finally confesses to Kyo, he tells her he knew her mother when he was a child, and that he could have saved Kyoko from the car that killed her except it would have revealed his curse. Unable in his guilt to accept Tohru's feelings, he says her love is an illusion and runs away. As she follows him, she meets Akito, who believes that Tohru's kindness to and acceptance of the cursed zodiac members has made them unfaithful to him, weakening their \"bond\" to the point that Momiji and Hiro have been freed from the curse. As he angrily confronts her, however, Tohru realizes that he is trapped by the past as much as she herself has been, by clinging to her mother's memory, and she extends her hand in friendship to Akito and introduces herself as a new start. However, before Akito can accept, Tohru falls down a nearby cliff when the ground collapses in the rain.The accident makes Kyo realize how much he values Tohru,and also allows Akito to finally break away from the roles he has held for most of his life.<br/><br/>Tohru survives the fall and is hospitalized. As she recovers, Akito accepts Tohru's friendship,and comes to accept both the person he is, instead of the god he has believed his father wished him to be,and the woman she was born as, instead of the man she was raised to be.Meanwhile Yuki, who has realized that what he wants from Tohru is an unconditional \"motherly\" love, not the love of a woman,convinces Kyo to reconcile with Tohru, and when she is discharged from the hospital, Kyo confesses his feelings for her.This acceptance of the cat, the first friend of the god of the zodiac, breaks zodiac curse and all the Sohmas are freed.In the last chapter, she and Kyo are shown packing to move to another city to continue his martial arts training, so that eventually he can inherit Kazuma's dojo, and in the final pages they are shown as a loving elderly couple with a granddaughter.<br/><br/>",

This Wild Thing fought to destroy a virtual drug more addictive than heroin in her time and reality.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Wild Thing was created by<a href=\"/simon-jowett/4040-59863/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-59863\"> Simon Jowett</a> and <a href=\"/duke-mighten/4040-43284/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43284\"> Duke Mighten</a>. Her namesake is unrelated to Rina Logan, as in Earth-8410, Rina never existed. Nikki actually appeared in a UK Marvel title in 1993, well before Rina was ever introduced. Nikki's ultimate fate is unknown.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>A new Fighter</h3><figure style=\"width: 1000px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/612078-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-612078\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.415\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/612078-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-612078\"><img alt=\"Wild Thing (Earth 8410) \" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/229/612078-1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/612078-1.jpg 1000w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/229/612078-1.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/229/612078-1.jpg 678w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>Wild Thing (Earth 8410) </figcaption></figure><p>Her primary enemies were virtual reality versions of Venom, Carnage, and the Sinister Six. Aside Wolverine, it was never made clear who her parents or grandmother were, and it is unlikely it ever will be. The only thing the two Wild Things actually share in common is that they are both relatives of Wolverine from alternate futures.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Technopathy </h3><p>Nikki's primary ability is to access/enter virtual reality games and even cyberspace itself; she can interact/synchronize with these environments, altering their programs, and she can alter her own archetype, granting it certain abilities to overcome various assaults. She can also access and utilize loopholes in the game or its programming. Her cyberspace archetype wore wrist blasters. Injuries occurring to her archetype in cyberspace were mirrored on her real body back on Earth. She was usually assisted by computer expert Liddel, who used a \"tether\" to anchor her to reality, so that he could pull her out if she got in over her head.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Versions</h2><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2>",

    "description": "<p>Betty Forest's life was shattered when her mother died from cancer and her father unable to deal with the grief turned to drinking and became abusive. Things continued to grow worste for Betty when she fell in love with a man named Wayne. Thinking she had finally found the right man, it was not meant to be as Wayne was just as abusive as her father. Betty eventually came to St. Andrew's and in the counciling of Caitlan Leiber who was fresh out of school at that point. Betty eventually returned to Wayne and Caitlan feeling she failed turned to her other patients. Things for Betty continued to spin out of control and she was hit pretty bad by Wayne in a run down factory they were living in. Betty was exposed to experimental cryo-freeze chemicals that created the Iron Man foe, Frostbite. Betty was transformed into a being who cound manipluate cold forces from body temp to wind. She became Bitter Frost and went out seeking revenge on those who hurt her. She tracked down her father and froze him to death before searching for Caitlan, which lead her into a fight with May Parker but spared her thinking she was a victume like her. Bitter Frost escaped and went out to find Wayne before she was tracked down by Spider-girl, Caitlan and Detective Drasco. A fight broke out causing Wayne to slip out unseen while Bitter Frost attacked the three. However, during a fight with Drasco, a piece of frozen 2x4 broke off and caused Wayne's propane heater to explode causing Betty's body to heat up and she returned to normal. She is currently imprisoned in Ravencroft while Caitlan continues to try and help her.    </p>",
