    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Mary Delacroix is an orphan who was raised for a time by <a href=\"/sister-justine/4005-125595/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-125595\">Sister Justine</a> (\"Ju-Ju'), who tried to instill in Mary a reverence for life and God, and also taught her how to shoot. Mary went on to train to be a <a href=\"/warrior-nuns/4060-60758/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60758\">Warrior Nun</a>. Rebellious from the beginning, she left the order to strike out on her own, in part because of a resentment over the preferential treatment the <a href=\"/magic-priests/4060-60757/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60757\">Magic Priests</a> received over the Nuns.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shotgun Mary was created by <a href=\"/ben-dunn/4040-8635/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-8635\">Ben Dunn</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After leaving the order, Mary no longer has any divine powers that are granted to the Warrior Nuns. Her abilities are limited to her exceptional marksmanship and knowledge of firearms. She's also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant.</p><h2>Equipment and Weapons</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Her preference for shotguns gave her her name. She uses silver bullets as well as blessed ammunition (a mixture of holy ash and incense) to avoid collateral human damage.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-5118203\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/5118203-shotgun+mary+action+figure.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3693931398417\" data-width=\"1137\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1137px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.9%\" href=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/5118203-shotgun+mary+action+figure.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5118203\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110802/5118203-shotgun+mary+action+figure.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110802/5118203-shotgun+mary+action+figure.jpg 1137w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/110802/5118203-shotgun+mary+action+figure.jpg 701w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110802/5118203-shotgun+mary+action+figure.jpg 467w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" data-width=\"467\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Antarctic Press released Shotgun Mary action figures, with several color variants, in 1996.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Known variants are:</p><ul><li>Purple Chest (portrayed)</li><li>Black Chest</li><li>Leather Jacket</li><li>White Leather Jacket</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>Destroyer Duck was an anthology comic book written by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41456\" href=\"/steve-gerber/4040-41456/\">        Steve Gerber</a>, creator of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6803\" href=\"/howard-the-duck/4005-6803/\">        Howard The Duck</a>, with artwork by the late, great <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\" href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\">        Jack Kirby</a>. It was published in 1982 by <a data-ref-id=\"4010-285\" href=\"/eclipse/4010-285/\">        Eclipse</a> Comics. The comic came about as a way for Steve Gerber to raise funds for a lawsuit he was involved in with <a data-ref-id=\"4010-31\" href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\">        Marvel</a> over the ownership of Howard The Duck which Gerber created for Marvel in 1973. </p> <p>The main story involved Duke “Destroyer” Duck, who had witnessed his best friend, identified only as “The Little Guy” vanish without a trace. Some time later, TLG reappeared only to expire at Destroyer’s feet— but not before telling him the story of how he was exploited and ruined by a thoughtless giant conglomeration called “Godcorp”. Destroyer swore revenge and vowed to take down Godcorp at all costs. Throughout the story, it's implied that The Little Guy was in fact Howard the Duck (though the character was never seen clearly enough for a positive ID), which made Godcorp the symbolic replacement for Marvel Comics.</p> <p>In later Destroyer Duck stories, it was revealed that \"The Little Guy\" who died was in fact a clone with the original still being held at Godcorp. It turned out The Little Guy's real name was \"Leonard\", a duck character identical to Howard The Duck in every way aside from his name.</p> <p>It should also be noted that the original Destroyer Duck comic contained the first appearance of <a data-ref-id=\"4040-8969\" href=\"/sergio-aragones/4040-8969/\">    Sergio Aragonés’</a> character <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3170\" href=\"/groo-the-wanderer/4050-3170/\">        Groo the Wanderer</a>. <br /><br /></p><h3>Specimen Q</h3>Destroyer Duck eventually was caught by the Godcorp; exploited and sold  as a lab animal. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21930\" href=\"/brainard/4005-21930/\">  Brainard</a> was the one who bought him; he trapped him  into stasis armor and designated him as Specimen Q. He sometimes would release Destroyer Duck and experiment on him, that's how destroyer Duck lost his arm, what now is replaced by cybernetics.<br /> <br />He is discovered in the lab by <a href=\"../../shrrrnn/29-52491/\" rel=\"nofollow\">       Sh'rrrnn</a> who has taken a form of <a href=\"../../magnolia-steele/29-21931/\" rel=\"nofollow\">       Magnolia Steele</a>.  Using the knowledge gained from assuming her form she knows that the being in armor is known as Specimen Q. Destroyer Duck shows that he seeks allies  to escape from Brainard, he and the alien then team up and save  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21923\" href=\"/stryker/4005-21923/\">     Stryker</a>, Destroyer Duck then disappears.  <br />After the escape he travels to New York and found a jackhammer, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-26934\" href=\"/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/4060-26934/\">      Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> tried to stop him, thinking he is vandalizing public property. After they tired themselves out, he used the jackhammer on himself, hoping it would release him from the armor, but alas, it did not. He then returned to Brainard's warehouse, only to find it abandoned. There he found clues that Brainard might be in Chicago. He used an old ship left behind by Brainard, and flew there. He met up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5209\" href=\"/savage-dragon/4005-5209/\">   Savage Dragon</a> who again mistook his intentions and the two battled. After a very strong punch from Dragon, Destroyer Duck was released from the armor. Dragon then arrested him, for causing all the trouble. In the police station, Destroyer Duck tell Dragon his story, and they opt to join forces against Brainard. They go to Cleveland and crash a freak bar to uncover more about Brainard plans. Coincidently Destroyer Duck finds his friend \"The Little Guy\" and his redheaded girlfriend in the bar. They then return to Chicago and raid Anomalous American Society group to catch Brainard, but he escapes. \"The Little Guy\" and his girlfriend go through dye jobs and get new identities courtesy of Chicago witness protection. Destroyer Duck decides to stay in Chicago for a while hoping to hear something about Brainard again.",

He served in Vietnam and Iraq and moved through the ranks quickly. Kriegkopf is known for his complete barbarism rewarding his troops by having them rape locals in a war zone, pillage villages, and bayonet prisoners of war. He was especially known for his working for the CIA doing black op missions for the company outside of congressional oversight.</p><p>Later his sadism caught up to him when he beat a young Marine in front of a CNN camera crew causing the youth to become paralyzed for life. General Kriegkopf was stripped of his command and military rank by the military. Before his court martial he escaped out of the country with help from the CIA and ended up on <a href=\"/grand-nixon-island/4020-57380/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57380\">Grand Nixon Island</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The character General Kreigkopf was created by <a href=\"/garth-ennis/4040-40644/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40644\">Garth Ennis</a> and <a href=\"/steve-dillon/4040-23694/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-23694\">Steve Dillon</a> during their Punisher Marvel Knights run.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>General Kreigkopf was originally a general in the US Marine Corps but after being stripped of his command and rank and set up his own mercenary outfit with the help of the CIA on Grand Nixon Island. General Kriegkopf decided he wanted his mercenary outfit to get involved in terrorism viewing it as a way to dramatically increase his profits and scare nations to the point where they wouldn't try to interfere with his activities.</p><p>His first goal was to create a super assassin that would allow him to kill anyone who would pay for him for his killer's service. Using scientists in his outfit he stole <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">Shield</a> cyborg and resurrection technology and brought the <a href=\"/russian/4005-41663/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41663\">Russian</a> back from the dead to become his ultimate assassin.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Army of One</h3><p>General Kreigkopf revives the Russian turning him into a killer transgender cyborg to be his ultimate assassin. The Russian agrees to be his assassin if he is allowed one more shot at killing the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> which Kreigkopf agrees to. General Kreigkopf gets President <a href=\"/george-w-bush/4005-4660/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4660\">George W. Bush</a> to make sure the authorities won't interfere in the Russian's battle against the Punisher. During the battle the Russian when the Russian was about to kill Frank Castle when <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spiderman</a> showed up and saved his life.</p><p>Even though the Russian defeated Spiderman the Punisher's quick thinking beat the Russian and General Kreigkopf took the Russian back to Grand Nixon Island and told him he failed at his one chance of killing the Punisher and now it was time for him to be his assassin which the Russian agrees to. General Kreigkopf also made arrangements to allow the French government to use his island as a refueling stop to do a nuclear bomb test. The General looking to gain as much influence and profit as he could planned to gain favor at the very least from the French government despite hating the French with a passion or gain access to a nuclear weapon.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98479/2081431-the_punisher_v4_05___no_limits___07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081431\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1012658227848\" data-width=\"632\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 632px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98479/2081431-the_punisher_v4_05___no_limits___07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081431\"><img alt=\"The Punisher shooting General Kreigkopf.\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/98479/2081431-the_punisher_v4_05___no_limits___07.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/98479/2081431-the_punisher_v4_05___no_limits___07.jpg 632w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/98479/2081431-the_punisher_v4_05___no_limits___07.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/98479/2081431-the_punisher_v4_05___no_limits___07.jpg 581w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\" data-width=\"581\"></a><figcaption>The Punisher shooting General Kreigkopf.</figcaption></figure><p>Just a few days after the General arrived back on the island he gets a report of a man loose on his island killing his mercenaries. The General sends his former Special Forces mercenaries after the intruder and they end up being slaughtered which causes the General some concern but he continues on with his plans of using the Russian to assassinate a high profile target in Europe. Just as the Russian and a 100 of the General's mercenaries board a 747 and are about to take off they spot the intruder killing people on the island. The intruder blasts the 747's engine as it’s taking off with a grenade launcher causing it to blow up and crash into the island's fuel depot destroying it.</p><p>The General hears of this and realizes the Punisher is on his island and curses himself for thinking the Punisher wouldn't go after him sends the Russian after and most of his mercenaries after him. The General then takes control of the French government plane planning on using the nuclear bomb on it to destroy Brussels and kill the leaders of Europe. Just as that plane is taking off the Punisher confront General Kreigkopf and shoots him fatally wounding him but doesn't finish and goes after the plane with the nuclear bomb.</p><p>The Russian hears this and manages to catch up to the plane and climb on board. The General watches the whole time losing blood refusing medical attention wanting to see the Punisher die. A few minutes after takeoff the general sees the bomb falling out of the sky directly above Grand Nixon Island and screams in rage \"NO!\" just before the island is destroyed along with everyone else on it.</p>",

    "description": "<br/> <p>Years ago, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\" href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" slug=\"teen-titans\">      Teen Titans</a> were called upon to provide security for a rock concert taking place in the town of Eden Crest. The performer was a rock star named Limbo, who kids idolized and parents feared. Limbo incited a riot at the concert, which was contained by the Titans. The riot was actually a diversion. Limbo was actually trying to acquire an anti-aging formula, which was being worked on at Cardy Research Center. The Titans thwarted his plans and Limbo was not seen from again. </p> <p>Behind the scenes, \"Limbo\" was actually a demonic creature trying to acquire the anti-aging formula for the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13025\" href=\"/contessa-erica-alexandra-del-portenza/4005-13025/\" slug=\"contessa-erica-alexandra-del-portenza\">       Contessa</a>. \"Limbo\" made a sinister practice of enticing kids towards a path of social apathy and violence. Over the years, \"Limbo\" assumed different guises, each latching onto a persona that would prove charismatic to the young. Over the years, the demonic creature has assumed the (known) guises of Limbo, Grunge, Rave and most recently, Goth.      <br/> <br/>As Goth, he's a horror film actor that takes his role to the extreme, wearing his 'make-up' 24 hours a day. Goth flirts with concepts of mortality, death and chaos – often intriguing teenagers with his dark demeanor. Nightwing became suspicious of Goth when a string of murders mirrored the plots of Goth's movies. As the Titans engaged Goth at a horror convention, the team was transported to Goth's portion of Hell, known as Dis. </p> <p>In Dis, all residents have immortality, but start to lose the ability to care about anything. Goth had already lured hundreds of kids into Dis. Nightwing deduced that when an individual started caring about something in Dis, they were expunged and returned home. The Titans were eventually able to save the kids when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2389\" href=\"/starfire/4005-2389/\" slug=\"starfire\">     Starfire</a> put Goth in jeopardy. As all the kids idolized Goth, they cared he was in danger and were instantly transported home. </p> <p>Goth nonetheless continued his villainous ways. When the Titans were effected by<a data-ref-id=\"4005-11976\" href=\"/klarion/4005-11976/\" slug=\"klarion\">     Klarion the Witch Boy</a>'s aging spell, Goth once again plotted against them – and allied himself with the Contessa once again. To this end, he created a new army of 'upgraded' <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5297\" href=\"/wildebeest/4005-5297/\" slug=\"wildebeest\">   Wildebeest</a>. These Wildebeests looked like their predecessors, but once unmasked, were revealed to be actual Wildebeest-looking man-monsters. Goth commanded the new Wildebeests to attack JFK International and Grand Central Station. The Titans eventually defeated these new Wildebeests. <br/> <br/>Sometime later, Goth attempted to channel powerful dark magic, and was destroyed as a result. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\" href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" slug=\"justice-society-of-america\">  Justice Society</a> found only his charred corpse, with a gaping hole in his chest.He was slain by the prophet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9718\" href=\"/gog/4005-9718/\" slug=\"gog\"> Gog</a> who was killing \"false gods\" by ripping out their hearts.<br/> <br/></p>",

The artifact was in the possession of the Survivor, an incredibly long lived sole survivor of his race. White Raven had traveled through space in her ship, destroyed a space ship piloted by a group of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\" href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\">Skrulls,</a> and actually flew into and onto a comet where the Survivor was located. As it turns out the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\" href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a> had been sent by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\">Galactus</a> to retrieve the mysterious and powerful artifact in possession of the Survivor as well. The Silver Surfer had reached the Survivor before White Raven had, so as he was handing the artifact, which had been revealed to be a crystal, over to the Surfer, she shot him, causing the artifact to fall from his hand and shatter. Emerging from the crystal was a giant red beastly creature. Revealing itself as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48552\" href=\"/elder-demon/4005-48552/\">Elder Demon,</a> the creature swore revenge for being imprisoned. Even the power of the Silver Surfer would be inadequate in facing this demonic being. White Raven would impale the powerful creature with her ship, causing an energy feedback within the Elder Demon supposedly killing him.             <br /> <br /><h2>Creation</h2>White Raven is a Marvel comic book character created by writer <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41799\" href=\"/ron-marz/4040-41799/\">Ron Marz</a> and artist <a data-ref-id=\"4040-4656\" href=\"/claudio-castellini/4040-4656/\">Claudio Castellini.</a> Her first and only appearance so far was in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-19500\" href=\"/silver-surfer-dangerous-artifacts/4050-19500/\">Silver Surfer: Dangerous Artifacts #1</a> released in 1996. <br /> <br /><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>White Raven would wield highly advanced twin laser blasters. She could fly and survive in the vacuum of space. She had a ruthless and efficient attitude.",

It turns out that she has enormous talent in drawing and she's super fast to draw. She took a few hours to drawing what would have taken a few weeks for Nelson.  She learns every day what real life is: getting her hands dirty, manage relationships, buying things...  <br/><br/>Nelson, who seems to be her lover, helped her a lot in her adaptation. He was the first to see her without a mask, to her natural state. He  <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68435/1320814-thunderfox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1320814\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.2286282306163\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:222.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68435/1320814-thunderfox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1320814\"><img alt=\"In Nelson's clothes\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68435/1320814-thunderfox.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68435/1320814-thunderfox.jpg 503w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68435/1320814-thunderfox.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68435/1320814-thunderfox.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>In Nelson's clothes</figcaption></figure>offered her to find a name and gave her temporary clothes to go buying her own clothes at the mall -she did not pass unnoticed in her superhero suit. <br/> <br/>Thunderfox, a redhead girl with blue eyes, is physically developed enough. More muscular than her penciler lover, she has a body that is the envy of a saleswoman in her shopping. She must measure about 5.9ft and weigh over 150 pounds.     <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68435/1322033-new_ff_members.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1322033\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3126593033135\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68435/1322033-new_ff_members.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1322033\"><img alt=\"Thunderfox, a new FemForce member \" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68435/1322033-new_ff_members.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68435/1322033-new_ff_members.jpg 1177w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68435/1322033-new_ff_members.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68435/1322033-new_ff_members.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68435/1322033-new_ff_members.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Thunderfox, a new FemForce member </figcaption></figure>Nightveil had intended to invite Thunderfox as a member of FemForce. But Nightveil was not certain of having done well giving birth to her. She wanted to discuss that with everyone. By magic, she has allowed the team to see Thunderfox in her every day life for several hours. After this \"presentation\", everybody were delighted. Thunderfox has a nice personality, she seems dedicated, friendly and sociable. And she seems pretty strong. They wanted her to be invited to join FemForce.    <p> </p> <p>Her formal FemForce membership was officialize some time later, at the same time as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6650\" href=\"/stardust/4005-6650/\" slug=\"stardust\">Stardust</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6654\" href=\"/tara/4005-6654/\" slug=\"tara\">Tara </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1343\" href=\"/dragonfly/4005-1343/\" slug=\"dragonfly\">Dragonfly</a>. She was nervous but very happy to join this team of super-heroines.   <br/>  </p> <h3>Powers </h3> <p>We quickly seen that Thunderfox is super strong. While her boyfriend sees a car parked in his parking</p> <p>spot, she goes lift the car easily and goes deposit it elsewhere. We have also seen Thunderfox fold a crane with her bare hands to save a man from death or move a space shuttle. Stardust had never seen such an awesome display of naked power. Thunderfox said that where she comes, the weight of objects doesn't matter. Ater Ms. Victory, she is the strongest in the team, physically speaking. <br/> <br/>She can fly at great speed and she is super fast. <br/> <br/>She has a power bolt, able to desintegrate objects in space. <br/> <br/></p> <h3>A sudden departure...</h3> <p>Sadly, she suddenly disappeared from the world of FemForce in issue #24. Its creator, James Misson, left AC Comics. The company policy is to not use a character who is not their property.  <br/> <br/>In the story, to explain her disappearance (in issue #29), Nightveil says to others that her book has been canceled. Even the memory of Thunderfox has been erased on the dimentional plane...  </p>",

She was formerly a member of the <a href=\"/ice-pack/4060-57342/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57342\">Ice Pack</a>, a group of ice-themed super-villains, but was kicked out for not being \"cool\" enough. She battled <a href=\"/power-girl/4005-4915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4915\">Power Girl</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-mid-nite/4005-11238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11238\">Dr. Mid-Nite</a>, and wielded a variety of weaponry, including a hat which formed blue snow and a smoking pipe which projected icicles. Power Girl and Dr. Mid-Nite easily defeated her and retrieved the sapphire she had stolen.</p><p>When <a href=\"/vartox/4005-13078/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13078\">Vartox</a> came to Earth to make Power Girl his bride, his seduction musk was inhaled by the Blue Snowman. She confessed her love for Vartox after being affected by the musk, then protected him against the Ix Negaspike using her hat. This caused the creature's attention to turn to Blue Snowman, and it quickly devoured her. Whether she survived the attack is yet to be seen.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">New 52</h3><p>Alongside her robot minions, the Blue Snowman was seen battling Wonder Woman and her ally, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hessia/4005-95314/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-95314\">Hessia</a>. The robots were quickly dispatched, and it is unknown what became of the Blue Snowman, though it's likely she was incarcerated after her defeat.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Blue snowman uses invention handed down to her by her father these include a telescope that could see long distances and cause snowstorms that could down even a plane.The snow she uses is actually a chemical that upon touch of a person could freeze them into a blue statue that only a super powered being like wonder woman could shrug off.She also is a stealth artist and could run as fast as an Olympic athlete</p><p> </p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>DC Super Friends</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6535/875591-bluesnowman4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875591\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 313px\" data-ratio=\"1.2779552715655\" data-width=\"313\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6535/875591-bluesnowman4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875591\"><img alt=\"Blue Snowman in DC Super Friends\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6535/875591-bluesnowman4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6535/875591-bluesnowman4.jpg 313w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" data-width=\"313\"></a><figcaption>Blue Snowman in DC Super Friends</figcaption></figure><p>Blue Snowman appeared in the comic book series <a href=\"/dc-super-friends/4050-21000/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21000\">DC Super Friends</a> as a member of the Ice Pack, alongside other ice-related villains <a href=\"/captain-cold/4005-2392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2392\">Captain Cold</a>, <a href=\"/mr-freeze/4005-3715/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3715\">Mister Freeze</a>, <a href=\"/killer-frost/4005-3415/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3415\">Killer Frost</a>, <a href=\"/icicle/4005-12097/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12097\">Icicle</a>, and <a href=\"/minister-blizzard/4005-47444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47444\">Minister Blizzard</a>.

During the mission, he experienced some visions, that he would later understand to be an example of the Force. He also met <a href=\"/jan-ors/4005-51881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51881\">Jan Ors</a>, a Rebel Agent. For reasons he did not understand, he allowed her and some of her people to leave the base unharmed.</p><p>He graduated the Academy with honors. But unfortunately, during the mission, his father Morgan Katarn was killed by <a href=\"/inquisitor-jerec/4005-51828/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51828\">Jerec</a>, a Dark Jedi in search of the legendary <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/valley-of-the-jedi/4020-57178/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57178\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valley of the Jedi</a>. He was led to believe that his father's death was the result of a Rebel raid on Sulon. He took time off before entering into active service, where he met Jan Ors once again. After a brief skirmish, Jan was able to show Kyle proof that the Imperials were responsible for the death of Kyle's father, not the Rebel Alliance.</p><p>Kyle defected from the Empire, working as a mercenary and an agent for the Rebels. Kyle was a crucial part of the operation to steal the plans to the <a href=\"/death-star/4020-45965/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45965\">first Death Star</a>. He infiltrated the facility on Danuta and transmitted the information to <a href=\"/princess-leia/4005-33545/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33545\">Leia Organa</a> aboard <a href=\"/tantive-iv/4055-56085/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56085\">Tantive IV</a>, playing a key role in the destruction of the Death Star and the eventual destruction of the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/galactic-empire/4060-45742/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45742\" rel=\"nofollow\">Galactic Empire</a> as a whole.</p><p> </p><h4>Valley of the Jedi</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9606/223505-119461-kyle-katarn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223505\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5775\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9606/223505-119461-kyle-katarn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223505\"><img alt=\"Kyle Katarn wielding a lightsaber\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9606/223505-119461-kyle-katarn.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9606/223505-119461-kyle-katarn.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9606/223505-119461-kyle-katarn.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kyle Katarn wielding a lightsaber\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9606/223505-119461-kyle-katarn.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9606/223505-119461-kyle-katarn.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9606/223505-119461-kyle-katarn.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kyle Katarn wielding a lightsaber</figcaption></figure><p>A year after the destruction of the second Death Star and the defeat of the Empire on Endor, Kyle Katarn was simply a freelance mercenary. He went on a quest to find his father's murderer, and was visited by the Force ghost of <a href=\"/qu-rahn/4005-52048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52048\">Qu Rahn</a>, Jedi Master and friend to Kyle's father Morgan. He was told of the Valley of the Jedi, something that Morgan and Qu Rahn kept hidden - and something that Jerec, the killer of Morgan and Rahn, desperately wanted. Kyle retrieved Qu Rahn's <a href=\"/lightsaber/4055-44097/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\">lightsaber</a> and proved that he was a natural duelist, proving capable of defeating the Dark Knight <a href=\"/yun/4005-51851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51851\">Yun</a> without any formal training. Kyle discovered the location of the Valley on Ruusan, immediately going to stop Jerec.</p><p>When he arrived, he found Jan Ors held hostage by Jerec, who attempted to turn Kyle to the dark side. Kyle resisted, and Jerec lashed out, bringing down his own outpost and defeating Kyle. While Kyle was unconscious, <a href=\"/sariss/4005-51850/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51850\">Sariss</a> - Jerec's apprentice - attempted to kill Kyle. But Yun stopped her, resulting in Yun's death. Kyle awakened, retrieving Yun's lightsaber and proceeded to duel Sariss. After a harsh fight, Kyle emerged the victor. Kyle continued deep into the Valley, rescuing Jan and going to face Jerec. But he wasn't able to stop Jerec from bathing in the Valley's power, approaching a power that - Kyle feared - may have rivaled the Emperor. Kyle, however, was able to defeat him by wrapping him in a barrier made up of the light side of the Force, cutting Jerec off from his power. Kyle was able to strike him down.</p><p>Kyle would build a new lightsaber. Because he feared going to the dark side, he gave it to <a href=\"/luke-skywalker/4005-6315/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6315\">Luke Skywalker</a> for safe keeping before returning to his life as a mercenary with Jan Ors.</p><p> </p><h4>Jedi Knight</h4><p>Kyle and Jan worked side by side as freelance mercenaries for 7 years after the incident in the Valley of the Jedi, eventually developing a romantic relationship. <a href=\"/mon-mothma/4005-16174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16174\">Mon Mothma</a> contacted the duo in order to carry out a mission for the <a href=\"/new-republic/4060-51084/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51084\">New Republic</a> that she believed involved a plot to involving the Valley of the Jedi, because Kyle and Jan were the only living people who knew the Valley's location and therefore a good choice for the mission.</p><p>They attacked a small Imperial Remnant outpost on the planet Kejim, uncovering a research facility that experimented on crystals capable of containing the Force. They discovered a mining facility on Artus Prime that was mining the crystals for the Empire. Kyle and Jan heavily damaged the facility and released the slaved miners. However, during the mission they were attacked by two Dark Jedi - Desann and his apprentice, Tavion, holding Jan captive. Kyle tried to fight Desann, but it had been a long time since Kyle used the Force, and he was quickly overwhelmed by Desann. Desann ordered that Tavion kill Jan, and Kyle could do nothing but hear her scream from inside the shuttle. Desann tossed Kyle aside and flew away, leaving Kyle in his rage.</p><p>In an act of brash anger, Kyle immediately went to the Valley of the Jedi, where he was visited by his father, who tried to stop Kyle from drawing on the Valley's power. But it was in vain; while the spirits of the Valley were free, there remained a powerful nexus of Force energy, which Kyle drew on in order to quickly restore his power. Unbeknownst to him, however, Desann planned all of this. Hew knew Kyle would go to the Valley, and followed him there.</p><p>Kyle went to <a href=\"/yavin-4/4020-56354/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56354\">Yavin IV</a> in order to get his lightsaber back from Luke Skywalker. Luke allowed him, but not before having him pass some brief trials in order to make sure he was capable. He was a bit too capable, making Luke skeptical, and causing Kyle to reveal what he had done. Luke warned him of such behavior. He also told Kyle that Desann used to be a student at his Academy Kyle gave Luke the coordinates for the Valley, asking him to check on the Valley for him while he himself went in search of Jan's killers.</p><p>Kyle followed Desann's underworld contacts, eventually running into <a href=\"/lando-calrissian/4005-6355/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6355\">Lando Calrissian</a> on <a href=\"/nar-shaddaa/4020-56388/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56388\">Nar Shaddaa</a> and rescuing him from Reelo Baruk, one of Desann's contacts. The two escaped on Lando's ship, the <a href=\"/lady-luck/4055-56149/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56149\">Lady Luck</a>, and traveled to <a href=\"/cloud-city/4020-56360/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56360\">Cloud City</a> - which was suffering from an Imperial Remnant occupation. While there, he ran into a Reborn - a Dark Jedi trained by Desann and unnaturally empowered by the Force using the energy from the Valley of the Jedi. Kyle defeated the Reborn and helped rescue the Bespin Security Force, which quickly restored order.</p><p>Before she could escape, Kyle Katarn confronted Tavion, Desann's apprentice, and the one who personally struck Jan Ors down. He fought and defeated her, his rage consuming him as he threatened to kill Tavion while using Force choke. Because of her fear, she revealed to Kyle that Jan was indeed alive, and that Desann only wanted to fool Kyle so they could follow him to the Valley. She also told Kyle that Jan was aboard the <i>Doombringer,</i> a ship belonging to Galak Fyyar - lead scientist on Desann's Reborn project. Kyle tossed her aside, controlling his anger and telling her to leave.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2416462\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.96176821983274\" data-width=\"837\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 837px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2416462\"><img alt=\"Fighting side-by-side with the Grandmaster\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg 837w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fighting side-by-side with the Grandmaster\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg 837w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2416462-kyleandluke.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fighting side-by-side with the Grandmaster</figcaption></figure><p>Kyle took Tavion's ship to the Cairn Installation within an Asteroid belt, which is where the <i>Doombringer</i> was being built. He discovered that they were smuggling a metal known as <a href=\"/cortosis/4055-56822/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56822\">Cortosis</a>, which is a lightsaber-resistant metal that can also temporarily deactivate a lightsaber. Kyle ran into Luke Skywalker in the facility, who had also followed the trail. The two were ambushed by a new type of soldier called Shadowtroopers - Reborns who are enhanced by a crystal imbued with the Force that has been placed at the heart of the trooper's chestplate, their entire suit of armor made out of Cortosis. Luke and Kyle fought the Shadowtroopers and emerged victorious.</p><p>As Kyle made his way to the <i>Doombringer</i>, Luke confronted Desann. They two briefly fought before Desann escaped. Luke returned to Yavin while Kyle continued into the <i>Doombringer</i>. He discovered that the <i>Doombringer</i> was en-route to Yavin IV for an all out assault on the <a href=\"/jedi-praxeum/4020-57977/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57977\">Jedi Academy</a>. They called in <a href=\"/rogue-squadron/4060-53670/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-53670\">Rogue Squadron</a> to attack the <i>Doombringer</i> when it emerged from Hyperspace. However, they found that the shields were too strong. The <i>Doombringer</i> rained down transport pods onto the surface of Yavin IV. Rogue Squadron attempted to destroy as many pods as they could, but many slipped through.</p><p>Kyle brought down the shields just as he was confronted by Galak Fyyar, who wore an experimental suit of armor with a shield. Kyle killed Fyyar as Rogue Squadron took their opportunity and attacked, taking down their artificial gravity systems in the process. Kyle found Jan and the two managed to get away in an escape pod, following Desann and his people. After crash landing, the two lovers embraced briefly before Kyle made his way through the swamps of Yavin IV to the Jedi Academy. He fought many Reborns and Remnant forces alongside his fellow Jedi and New Republic soldiers. He went down into the very catacombs and fought Desann. He tried to turn Desann back to the light, showing how much Kyle had truly changed during his mission. Desann refused, forcing Kyle to strike him down after a fight.</p><p>Kyle, Jan, and Luke met in the Academy once the fight was over. Luke congratulated Kyle, offering to take his lightsaber back into safe keeping, assuming Kyle was going to return to his life as a mercenary. Instead, Kyle decided to keep it, staying a Jedi. He and Jan went on a brief vacation to the beaches of Spira.</p><p> </p><h4>Jedi Master and teacher</h4><p>Kyle Katarn found a place at the Jedi Academy, becoming a teacher and earning the rank of Jedi Master - despite his distaste for being called \"master\" or \"Master Katarn,\" preferring his students to call him simply \"Kyle.\"</p><p>In 14 ABY (two years after the fight with Desann), Kyle took on two students: Jaden Korr and Rosh Penin - Jaden Korr being a rather unique case due to the fact that he managed to create his own lightsaber without any formal training. During their travel to the Jedi Academy, their shuttle malfunctioned, forcing it down in the jungles and causing at least two of the students - Jaden and Rosh - to hike it on foot to the Academy. They encountered some Imperial Remnant Stormtroopers and a Dark Jedi, who Jaden - in a stunning display of ability - dispatched without much difficulty. He discovered two Dark Jedi using a strange rod and drawing energy from a nearby temple. He was discovered and knocked unconscious, awakening to the sight of Kyle Katarn and a few other Jedi, including Luke Skywalker.</p><p>Kyle was given both students to train, taking them into the ruins and having them run some trials. During the trials, in an act of competition, Rosh sent a Jedi Training droid after Jaden to slow him down, which Jaden defeated. Kyle chastised Rosh, saying that - had the droid been set at a high level, like Luke - it could have killed Jaden.</p><p>Kyle sent both on small missions around the Galaxy. Jaden, however, was sent on more difficulty missions than Rosh due to his abilities, and those missions had strong ties to finding out what the Remnant was doing on Yavin IV. It would be discovered that the Dark Jedi on Yavin were siphoning dark side Force energy from the temples, working for a group known as the Disciples of Ragnos - made up of Reborn left over from Desann's plot and Imperial Remnant soldiers. While looking into the group's interest in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/hoth/4020-45966/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45966\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hoth</a>, Jaden encountered Alora, a Dark Jedi with the Disciples. He defeated her, but was incapable of preventing her escape. On another mission, Rosh was captured by the Disciples of Ragnos. It was discovered that the Disciples of Ragnos have a quest to bring back the long-dead ancient Sith Lord, <a href=\"/marka-ragnos/4005-64268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64268\">Marka Ragnos</a>.</p><p>Later, Kyle traveled with Jaden to investigate the group's next target: <a href=\"/vjun/4020-57474/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57474\">Vjun</a>, home to Bast Castle, <a href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\">Darth Vader's</a> famed fortress. Jaden and Kyle ended up getting separated, forcing Jaden to delve deeper into the castle. He eventually stumbled on three Dark Jedi draining the power from Vader's old meditation chamber. One of the Dark Jedi turned around, revealing himself to be Rosh Penin, Kyle's former student. Rosh attempted to lure Jaden to the dark side, but he resisted, resulting in a fight between Jaden, Rosh, and the Kothos twins. He defeated the trio, leaving Rosh begging for his life. Suddenly, Rosh's new master revealed herself: Tavion Axmis wielding the Scepter of Ragnos, Desann's former apprentice. Kyle came in time to stop Tavion from killing Jaden. The two exchanged words, where Tavion was angered that Kyle shamed her by allowing her to live. She brought down the ceiling, destroying Jaden's lightsaber. Jaden was saved by Kyle Katarn, who was able to hold up the falling debris in time for Jaden to use Kyle's lightsaber to cut through the floor.</p><p>Kyle and Jaden returned to the Academy, where Jaden was given the rank of Jedi Knight. Jaden created a new lightsaber and continued on his quest to defeat the Disciples of Ragnos. They learned that the Disciples were ready to complete their plans to resurrect the Sith Lord. However, they had enough time to go to Taspir III to find Rosh, who had sent off a distress message to them. Jaden and Kyle split up to search the facility. Jaden found him first, becoming enraged when he saw that Rosh was completely okay and in no danger. He considered killing Rosh, constantly tempted by the Dark Jedi Alora to do so and join her. Kyle, however, sensed what was happening and contacted Jaden telepathically to sooth his rage. Jaden resisted, turning Rosh back to the light. Jaden fought Alora, but Rosh was injured severely when Alora cut off his arm during the fight.</p><p>Jaden struck Alora down just as Kyle came, carrying Rosh away for medical attention while Jaden went to join the fight on <a href=\"/korriban/4020-57442/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57442\">Korriban</a> to stop Tavion. He fought her, defeating her once, but was unable to stop her from bringing back the spirit of Marka Ragnos, who possessed Tavion's body. Jaden, however, proved himself very capable when he struck her down, defeating Marka Ragnos himself and destroying the Scepter.</p><p>Rosh was treated for his injuries, the medics equipping him with a prosthetic. Jaden was congratulated and Rosh was redeemed.</p><p> </p><h4>Second Galactic Civil War</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/1024476-jacen_solo_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1024476\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3129102844639\" data-width=\"457\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 457px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/1024476-jacen_solo_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1024476\"><img alt=\"Darth Caedus - the first Sith Lord that Kyle ever fought\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" data-width=\"487\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/1024476-jacen_solo_12.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/1024476-jacen_solo_12.jpg 457w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Darth Caedus - the first Sith Lord that Kyle ever fought\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/1024476-jacen_solo_12.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/1024476-jacen_solo_12.jpg 457w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" data-width=\"487\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Darth Caedus - the first Sith Lord that Kyle ever fought</figcaption></figure><p>Luke Skywalker's nephew, <a href=\"/darth-caedus/4005-47939/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47939\">Jacen Solo</a>, turned to the dark side and took control of the Galactic Alliance, sending the Jedi into exile and calling himself Darth Caedus. Kyle was among the many Jedi in hiding on Endor and was sent to ambush Darth Caedus outside of the Senate building on Coruscant. With him was Thann Mithric, Kolir Hu'lya, Seha Dorvald, and <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/valin-horn/4005-64778/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64778\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valin Horn</a>.

Thann was killed during the fight and Katarn himself was almost killed by a stab to the chest. They were unable to defeat him, but they succeeded in planting the device. The remaining Jedi narrowly escaped.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>The Jedi Knight trilogy of graphic novels – adaptations of a game of the same name – is the most important material for the character, defining his origin and defining moments. The books are: <i>Soldier for the Empire, Rebel Agent, and Jedi Knight.</i> The first serves as a prequel, whereas the last two are adaptations of the Jedi Knight game. In the Star Wars universe, both the game and graphic novels are canon.</p><p>Kyle would later appear in <i>Star Wars: Tales</i> #21 in the short story <i>Equals and Opposites</i>, showing Kyle’s experience during the Yuuzhan Vong War as a Jedi Master.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-761078\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6326530612245\" data-width=\"490\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 490px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:163.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-761078\"><img alt=\"Kyle Katarn vs Sariss\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" data-width=\"392\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg 490w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg 392w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kyle Katarn vs Sariss\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg 490w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13569/761078-kyle_sariss.jpg 392w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" data-width=\"392\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kyle Katarn vs Sariss</figcaption></figure><p>Kyle Katarn is a natural duelist.

When Vale found a fatally wounded man named john Corban he took his brain and transplanted it in a robotic body powered by a Kryptonite heart. Once Corban awoke and found out what was going on he killed Vale and then went out to kill Superman.</p><p><strong>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</strong></p><p>Prof. Emmet Vale will be played by Ralph Lister. Unfortunately, the movie gives no other implication but its a good chance Metallo will make an appearance soon thanks to Prof. Vale. </p>",

    "description": "<h2><span>Origin</span></h2><p>Pandora was modeled by Hephaestus in the likeness of Aphrodite. He carved her out of a block of white marble, made her lips of red rubies and her eyes of sparkling sapphires. Athena breathed life into her and dressed her in elegant garments. Aphrodite decked her with jewels and fixed her red mouth in a winning smile. Into the mind of this beautiful creature, Zeus put the insatiable curiousity, and then he gave her a sealed jar and warned her never to open it.</p><p>Hermes brought Pandora down to earth and offered her in marriage to Epimetheus, who lived among the mortals. Epimetheus had been warned by Prometheus never to accept a gift from Zeus, but he could not resist the beautiful woman. Thus Pandora came to live among mortals. Men came from near and far to stand awestruck by her wondrous beauty.</p><p>However, Pandora was not perfectly happy, for she did not know what was in the jar that Zeus had given her. It was not long before her curiousity got the better of her and she had to take a quick peek.</p><p>The moment she opened the lid, out swarmed a horde of miseries: Greed, Vanity, Slander, Envy, along with all the evils that until then had been unknown to mankind. horrified at what she had done, Pandora clapped the lid on, just in time to keep Hope from flying away too. Zeus had put Hope at the bottom of the jar, and the unleashed miseries would quickly have put an end to it. They stung and bit the mortals as Zeus had planned, but their sufferings made them wicked instead of good, as Zeus had hoped. They lied, they stole, and they killed each other and became so evil that Zeus in disgust decided to drown them in a flood.</p><p>Only one man on earth had not turned evil. The son of Prometheus, Deucalion.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Pandora is created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-49016\" href=\"/mark-seifert/4040-49016/\" slug=\"mark-seifert\">Mark Seifert</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-49017\" href=\"/william-christensen/4040-49017/\" slug=\"william-christensen\">William Christensen</a>.</p>",

When she reached sixteen years of age, she built her first <a data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\" href=\"/lightsaber/4055-44097/\">lightsaber</a>.</p><p>Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Barriss and Luminara—along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\" href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> and his Padawan <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\" href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\">Anakin Skywalker</a>—were sent to Ansion to prevent the government of the planet from voting to join the Separatists. The mission was important because, although Ansion itself was not very important, if it chose to join the CIS then many other planets would follow. However there were many beings set upon making sure the Jedi's mission was a failure, one of them being the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56806\" href=\"/hutts/4060-56806/\">Hutt</a> Soergg who had been hired by Shu Mai to stop them.</p><p>The <a data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\" href=\"/jedi/4015-52199/\">Jedi</a> were allowed to talk to the Unity of Community. Luminara made a deal to the Unity: The Jedi would put an end to a conflict between the 'city-folk' and the Alwari natives if Ansion agreed to stay within the Galactic Republic and abide by their rules. The conflict was over land, so Luminara also said that they would get the Alwari to agree to share half or more of their land. The Unity agreed and the Jedi left. Before the Jedi could set off on their mission, two Alwari named Kyakhta and Bulgan were hired by Soergg to capture one of the Padawans. They caught Offee and held her prisoner, however both the Alwari were mentally impaired and so Offee managed to gain their trust by healing them. After this Kyakhta and Bulgan agreed to act as guides for the Jedi, as to secure the treaty with the Alwari, they would first have to find them. The Jedi left the city shortly after, riding suubatar. They shortly had more trouble with gairks in a stream but overcame this as well.</p><p>Eventually the Jedi managed to meet with the Yiwa—an Alwari tribe. At first, the Yiwa were mistrustful of the Jedi, and the Highborn, Mazong, requested that they each perform a display, and that after this, the Yiwa would decide whether or not to tell the Jedi where the overclan was. Barriss gave a display of acrobatics, which greatly impressed the Alwari, as well as Anakin. After the other Jedi had given their presentations, the Yiwa told them where the overclan could be found, and they set off again.</p><p>Later, the Jedi came across a group of Gwurran. After throwing a party for them, the Jedi left, but Tooqui—a Gwurran—came with them. It was shortly after that the Jedi met with a tribe of traders named the Qulun. The Jedi were offered food and accepted into the tribe, however the tribe leader Baiuntu was working for Soergg, and managed to capture the Jedi. Luckily, Tooqui got away, and shortly after rescued the six of them.</p><p>The Jedi soon came upon the Borokii overclan and gave their proposal. The Borokii agreed but only on the grounds that the Jedi settle a conflict that existed between the Borokii and the Januul, another overclan. The Jedi agreed and ultimately managed to settle the conflict diplomatically. They then returned to the city where they were again delayed by Soergg, who had hired thugs to dispatch them. However the Jedi managed to make it to the Unity, which was in the process of voting. Due to the fact that the Jedi had settled the border dispute, the Unity voted to stay within the Republic and the Jedis' mission was a success.</p><p>When Barriss and Luminara returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-48936\" href=\"/coruscant/4020-48936/\">Coruscant</a>, they were dispatched by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\" href=\"/mace-windu/4005-5395/\">Mace Windu</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56447\" href=\"/geonosis/4020-56447/\">Geonosis</a> as part of the stike team to rescue Obi-Wan, Anakin, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6343\" href=\"/padme-amidala/4005-6343/\">Padme Amidala</a>. Although Barriss was not in the final circle that was picked up by Yoda's gunships, she did find a way out of the Petranaki arena along with Jedi Knight Pablo-Jill.</p><p>Later on during the Clone Wars, Barriss and Luminara ventured to the ice-world Ilum. From this barren planet, the crystals needed in the construction of a lightsaber could be found. In a secret Jedi temple mine, Barriss built herself a new lightsaber with a crystal of her choice.</p><p>As she constructed her lightsaber, the location of the temple was compromised. Separatist chameleon droids had infiltrated the mines and placed explosive charges in the tunnels. Barriss and Luminara fought them off, but were trapped in the resulting cave-in using the Force to stop hold up the roof. This disturbance in the force reached <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5396\" href=\"/yoda/4005-5396/\">Yoda</a> and the diminutive Jedi Master rescued them.</p><p>While her Master guarded <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5409\" href=\"/nute-gunray/4005-5409/\">Nute Gunray</a> on the Tranquility, Offee oversaw a mission to Geonosis .</p><p>Offee and her master were sent to the planet Geonosis to aid Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55028\" href=\"/ahsoka-tano/4005-55028/\">Ahsoka Tano</a>, in helping destroy the weapons factory, headed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52777\" href=\"/poggle-the-lesser/4005-52777/\">Poggle the Lesser</a>. Tano and Offee were sent under to the catacombs, while Skywalker and Unduli acted as decoys. The Padawans made it to their destination, however they had been spotted and were attacked by the new Confederate super tank, as well as Geonosians, and the bombs they had planted were removed while the two were distracted. Tano and Offee took control of the tank, and came to the conclusion that the only way to destroy the factory would be to use the tank's weapons to fire upon the reactor, even though they knew that they likely would not survive the explosion. They did not know about the shielding on the tank, though, which saved the two Padawans, but they were buried under a large amount of debris. Worried they would die from lack of air, Ahsoka pulled a power cell apart, activating her comlink so their masters could find them. Anakin picked up the signal, leading their Masters to rescue them from the debris.</p><p>Barriss and Ahsoka were transporting a supply ship to the Ord Cestus medical station. The Padawans decided to get some sleep but while Barriss could Ahsoka couldn't. Unknown to them, a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47004\" href=\"/clone-trooper/4005-47004/\">clone trooper</a> was leaving the Brain worm eggs to spread across the ship. While Ahsoka and Barriss were eating, two clones tried to kill them. Later in the ship they saw Trap trying to infect them. Barriss was forced to kill him.</p><p>After discovering that clones upon their ship where being controlled by Brain worms, Barriss and Ahsoka then separated. Barriss was heading to the engineering section to disable the ships engines when she walked into a trap set by the clones. She was unable to resist as the clones exposed her to a brain worm and succumbed to the worm's influence. When she found Tano, the two began to duel. Ahsoka tried to convince Barriss to resist being controlled, and somewhat succeeded as Offee told Ahsoka to \"kill her\" in order to ensure the worm's death. However, when the worm tried to flee Barriss' body and enter Ahsoka's directly, Tano sliced the worm in half, releasing Barriss.</p><p>During the Invasion of Coruscant, Offee commanded a squad of clone troopers in the fight against Separatist droid forces. In the underlevels of the city, her squad was overrun by battle droids, including the new C-B3 cortosis battle droids that were resistant to her lightsaber. Just in time, young Anakin Skywalker arrived at the scene and managed to push back the droid forces.</p><p>Afterward, Barriss was sent to the planet Drongar; her first mission without her master. Drongar was the home to a valuable plant, bota, which was a miracle cure for almost anything and for any race, prized by both the Galactic Republic and the Separatists. Barriss, a gifted healer, assisted one of the medical units on the planet. Unknown to her, a spy was sneaking around the camp and several corrupt Republic representatives were shipping off bota illegally for their own profit.</p><p>In a turn of events, she accidentally injected herself with bota, and the natural drug opened up the Force in new and powerful ways. Barriss found this quick way to power to be too addictive and knew that it would lead her towards the dark side of the force, but she resisted its luring pull. Once she had overcome the inner battle of resisting the dark side, she felt that she had earned the rank of Jedi Knight and General.</p><p>Barriss remained in partnership with her former Master until the end of the Clone Wars. Dispatched to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56940\" href=\"/felucia/4020-56940/\">Felucia</a> to serve as a healer with her new Padawan <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58474\" href=\"/zonder/4005-58474/\">Zonder</a>, they were captured by Gossam Cammandos working for the Confederacy of Independant Systems and thrown in prison. They were later rescued by the Jedi <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5389\" href=\"/aayla-secura/4005-5389/\">Aayla Secura</a> and Erika, as well as the clone trooper lieutenant Galle. It was later revealed that Presidente Shu Mai of the Commerce Guild had arranged to poison Felucia's water supply, and so Offee and Secura sought to save the planet.</p><p>Following lieutenant Galle, Offee took a squad to Har Gau while Secura and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47045\" href=\"/clone-commander-bly/4005-47045/\">Commander Bly</a> went to Niango. When Offee's group arrived at their site, they saw that the defenders consisted mostly of setients, rather than droids, and realized they could not simply blast their way into the center. Padawan <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58397\" href=\"/drake-logaan/4005-58397/\">Drake Lo'gaan</a>, who had accompanied Secura to the planet enlisted Galle's help for his plan. In order for the Padawans to infiltrate the water planet, Zonder drew the attention of the Gossam Commandos, while Galle and the Padawans attacked, striking down the droids. The Padawans then detached from Galle's squad, moving into position near the center. Lo'gaan commed Galle and ordered him to activate the next phase of the plan, and Galle called for a retreat. The defenders pursued, leaving the way wide open for the Padawans to infiltrate the plant and stop the toxins.</p><p>As Galle fell back, Bly received an encrypted message from Coruscant, ordering him to execute <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55868\" href=\"/order-66/4015-55868/\">Order 66</a>, a contingency order that demanded the deaths of all Jedi. Galle and his squad rendezvoused with Offee, who was fighting off a number of battle droids. Galle came to a halt, and Offee ordered him to fire. The lieutenant complied; he ordered an <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56108\" href=\"/at-te/4055-56108/\">AT-TE</a> to open fire on Offee, killing her. As Offee died, lightyears away, her former master perished also.</p><p>When the Galactic Empire emerged, official records compiled by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53770\" href=\"/emperor-pestage/4005-53770/\">Sate Pestage</a> stated that Offee and Secura were both executed because they were plotting to poison Felucia's water supply.</p>",

Previous to the Goa’uld attack it was thought that the Stargate only led to Abydos, this was late proved incorrect by Samantha Carter working with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-60431\" href=\"/dr-daniel-jackson/4005-60431/\" slug=\"dr-daniel-jackson\">Doctor Daniel Jackson</a>.</p><p>Sam is a theoretical astrophysicist with a Ph.D. is Astrophysics who originally joined the Air Force as a gulf war pilot during the Gulf war.

Despite being against air force regulations it was brought to the forefront in the episode “There but for the grace of god” where Sam is engaged to Jack O’Neill in an alternate reality. Again in the episode “Point of View” is was established that the Sam and Jack from the alternate reality had been married for over a year.</li><li>In the episode “Window of Opportunity”, O'Neill resigns so that he can live out his fantasy of kissing Sam while they are stuck in a “time loop” so that he doesn’t have to deal with the fallout of it. In the episode \"Divide and Conquer\", both Sam and Jack openly admit that their feelings go beyond the professional. In the episode \"Grace\", Sam hallucinates an encounter with Jack in which she kisses him.</li><li>During the period where Samantha was the host to Jolinar, Sam appeared to receive the same emotional feelings from the symbiote towards another Tokra Martouf and his host Lantash. In a separate alternate reality they establish a long term relationship.</li><li>Rodney McKay, Rodney has a single minded attraction to Sam that ran through the entire series, though it was never reciprocated by Sam due to Rodney’s rude and arrogant personality and the way he deals with other people.</li><li>Orlin, Orlin was an ascended being from another planet that follows Sam back to earth out of curiosity for her species. In time they get to know each other and the two have a ‘mutual relationship’ of sorts which ends abruptly when he is forced to retake human form in that of a child.</li><li>Narim of the Tollan, Narim appeared several times through the series and showed a deep connection to Sam, though they never actually explored their relationship by the time that the Goa’uld attacked the Tollan home planet killing everyone including Narim.</li><li>Pete Shanahan – Sam was engaged to Pete for several months, possibly her longest relationship. The two are forced to break it off however after he learns of the Stargate program.</li></ul><p>After the end of the series Stargate SG1, Sam is promoted to a ‘full bird’ Colonel and is assigned to the creation of the “Mid Way Station” between Stargate Command and Atlantis. After the apparent death of Doctor Weir at the hands of the replicators however Sam is given full command of Atlantis.</p>",

The money that his father made through his science projects also provided Earl with an unseeming amount of cash. He tried to spend all this money with gambling, but usually won more then he could spent. It seemed that Earl could somehow 'see' what cards would lie down before him before it happened. During the beginning days of World War II, Earl's father was asked to sell an invention of him, iradiated bullets, to the Allied forces in England. This would cause the person whom was shot to die of radiation poisoning, even if it was not a killing shot. Earl and his father soon met with the Allies in England and demonstrated the bullets. There was however a spy inside the building whom grabbed the gun and aimed it at Earl's father to kill him, the only person whom knew how to produce the bullets. Earl however stept in the way and was shot in the head instead. The spy was quickly killed after the first shot was fired, but Earl seemed to lie lifeless on the floor. However, by luck (or fate), Earl survived the bullet wound. Surgeons managed to take out most of the bullet. Some pieces however remained which would, sooner or later, cause his death. But for now, Earl was alive and well. The accident even managed to empower Earl's strange sences. He somehow saw and heard things that had not yet happened. When he was able to stop a few Nazi spies on the ship that he and his father were on to return to America, Earl found his calling. He became known as the World War II superhero Mastermind Excello.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Mastermind Excello was created by Arnold Hicks and first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/mystic-comics-2-the-plot-against-america/4000-112758/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mystic Comics issue 2</a> (1940). He was only a minor character until he was reinvented by J. Michael Straczynski and Chris Weston in the pages of The Twelve.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Twelve</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1813688-mme2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1813688\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.98564593301435\" data-width=\"209\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 209px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1813688-mme2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1813688\"><img alt=\"Mastermind Excello leading the way\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1813688-mme2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1813688-mme2.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" data-width=\"209\"></a><figcaption>Mastermind Excello leading the way</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During World War II, every Allied superpower, sidekick or costume adventurer descended upon Berlin when the Germans were on the brink of defeat. Mastermind Excello and eleven other costume individuals which included <a href=\"/phantom-reporter/4005-46588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46588\">Phantom Reporter</a>, <a href=\"/rockman/4005-46338/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46338\">Rockman</a>, <a href=\"/fiery-mask/4005-46444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46444\">Fiery Mask</a>, the <a href=\"/witness/4005-46270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46270\">Witness</a>, <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-46234/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46234\">Black Widow</a>, <a href=\"/electro/4005-47069/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47069\">Electro</a>, <a href=\"../../dynamic-man/29-46577/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dynamic Man</a>, <a href=\"/mister-e/4005-61016/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61016\">Mister E</a>, <a href=\"/captain-wonder/4005-46390/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46390\">Captain Wonder</a>, <a href=\"/blue-blade/4005-46271/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46271\">Blue Blade</a> and <a href=\"/laughing-mask/4005-46576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46576\">Laughing Mask</a> went into the headquarters of the SS and discovered a secret, underground chamber. The heroes were trapped in the chamber and Electro shut down when the signal that controlled him could not penetrate that far beneath the ground. The rest of the Twelve were gassed by German scientists and placed inside freezing tubes to be studied and dissected at a later date. However, certain parts of Berlin were seized by the Russians and most of the scientist were either killed or placed in prison camps. The Twelve would lay dormant in suspended animation until they were discovered sixty plus years later and awaken in our current, modern time.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For every hero, now collectively better known as <a href=\"/the-twelve/4060-47547/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47547\">The Twelve</a>, it was a mayor adjustment to wake up 'in the future', more then 60 year after they where frozen. Most of the heroes stayed inside a mansion that had been payed for by the US government. For Earl, it was even worse, feeling and hearing every soundwave of phone calles, plains, internet an more. This made Earl decide to leave the house and find a place for himself, sheltered from these sound waves, so he had time to focus his powers once more. This was because Earl found out through his visions that something huge was brewing, and his fellow superheroes had something to do with it. He helped his friend Phantom Reporter with cryptic messages, trying to help him reveal what would happen.</p><h3>A Murderer Revealed</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It was however not soon after that a disturbing phone call came in; Mastermind Excello's teammate Blue Blade had been killed, and it seemed that the lifeless robot Electro, part of The Twelve, was to blame for it. Eventually, Phantom Reporter brought the remaining Twelve members together to expose the murderer. He revealed that Electro's control helmet revealed to him that Electro had been searching for contact while the Twelve slept. It had made contact with the synthetic brain of <a href=\"/dynamic-man/4005-46577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46577\">Dynamic Man</a> . This enabled Dynamic Man to control Electro. Richard revealed that Dynamic Man was actually an android and used Electro to murder several people he disliked, including Blue Blade. Dynamic Man snapped and destroyed the mansion the Twelve were staying in. Mastermind Excello, Fiery Mask, Phantom Reporter, and Captain Wonder started a search for Dynamic Man. Earl however told his fellow superheroes that one of them would not return of this fight alive. He could however not tell who this could be. Eventually, the team found Dynamic Man at the lab of his creator Professor Goettler. During the ensuing battle Earl used his mental powers to temporarily paralyze Dynamic Man. Fiery Mask was killed while he tried to rescue his friend Captain Wonder. His neck was snapped, but Jack was able to pass his powers to Phantom Reporter before he died. Phantom Reporter used his new powers to incinerate Dynamic Man and unluckily permantly scarred Captain Wonder in the process.</p><h3>A Change of Pace</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After their confrontation with Dynamic Man, most members of the Twelve went their own way. Mastermind Exello stayed inside a U.S. Army base with Phantom Repoter and Laughing Mask for some time, until he too decided to leave. Nothing was heard from him again untill after a few months when Phantom Reporter was the last to leave the U.S. Base and found out that a new house was offered to him thanks to EXC Enterprise. It turned out that Earl had bought a huge comapny and renamed it. He offered Phantom Reporter and Black Widow a place in his company EXC Enterprises as heroes to fight crime.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Mastermind Excello has superhuman strength and great mental powers.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Ratchet and Clank</h2><p>Clank was built on the robotic planet Quartu. The evil Chairman Drek was building robots and something went wrong when he built Clank so Clank was smaller then the other killer robots around. Clank now having a mind of his own wanted to stop Drek so he stole one of his ships and ran. Clank was shot down then he landed on the planet Veldin.</p><p>Ratchet saw the crash and explored until he saw the remains of the ship. Ratchet after dispatching a few robots took Clank back with him and continued to work on his ship. It was there that Clank awakened and told Ratchet all about Drek and his evil plans and how Clank needed to see Captain Quark so he could tell him and he could stop Drek. Ratchet said he couldn't help because he needed a ship and he didn't have one part. Clank said you need the robotic ignitions chip. So they left Veldin and crash landed on planet Novalis.</p><p>Now needing an entire ship they explore but they notice that Novalis looks like it's evacuating it's people because it looks like a war zone. When they traverse the battle ridden place they get to this gigantic ship and this half crazy man comes out thanking them for destroying the robots and as a reward gives them a ship and a infobot with Quark in it. When they leave that planet they head to the place they think Captain Quark is, the planet Metropolis. When they get there they travel around until they meet Al guy they saw in the infobot that crazy man gave them. He tells them Quark left but for 1,000 bolts he says he can upgrade Clank.</p><p><b>Ratchet and Clank in Blackwater City</b></p><p>After Ratchet pays him Clank gets the Heli-pack upgrade. They try out the upgrade and travel around some more until they find an infobot. This infobot leads them to another planet. From there they head to Blackwater City on the planet Rilgar. They have to win a hover board race to see Quark so they head up to the top of the stadium but while they head there they meet a mysterious person. He offers them something he calls a Rip you a New one. Ratchet then gets offended and says something back. The dude then explains his self and says R.Y.N.O Clank then realizes that weapon is the most powerful missile launcher in the galaxy. The guy says he'll give it to them for 250,000 bolts. They leave knowing they don't got that kind of money on them at the moment. After they win the hover board race and bribe Quark's bouncer they see Captain Quark. He says he wants them to come to his secret headquarters on the planet Umbris.</p><p>After they traverse the deadly battlefield they see Quark. Quark says step into the ring of heroes but Ratchet wasn't to sure he thought it was a trap. Unfortunately Clank was to eager to talk to Quark. They fell into the trap. Quark says the 2 can't interfere with Drek's plan so Ratchet says he's going to kill them. Then Quark said \"I'm not going to kill you Ratchet he is\" pointing to the Blargian Snagglebeast in the background. After a good battle the beast falls. Ratchet gets angry at Clank and tells him they shouldn't have fell into that trap so easily. Needing a new ship Ratchet commandeers one of Quark's ships but can't start it. Clank then says you need a robotic ignitions chip to start it. They both then leave Umbris.</p><p>They try to hunt down Drek but from an infobot they find that he has made a new weapon called the Deplanetizer. He said he was going to blow up the planet that was in the perfect orbit of his new planet, Veldin. The duo went to Veldin to stop Drek when they encounter him Clank turns into his other form Giant Clank. After they manhandle Drek he turns Clank back into his small size, then he sets off the Deplanetizer's countdown. Ratchet and Clank quickly defeated Drek and sended him to his new planet. The duo then aim the weapon at the new planet and blow it up. The debris from the planet almost crushes Ratchet &amp; Clank but with Clank's upgrades he flies them to safety. When they crash Clank's arm becomes broken and Ratchet leaves to go around his planet. Clank feeling depressed goes in the opposite direction. Ratchet then comes back and tells Clank to come and get his arm fixed. Clank runs to Ratchet ending their first adventure together.</p><h2>Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando</h2><p>After Ratchet &amp; Clank beat Drek they become huge celebrities but after a few months things start to cool down. When they get interviewed on Behind the Hero Ratchet said that no one needs a hero right now. After those lines Ratchet &amp; Clank get teleported to the Bogon Galaxy where they meet someone named Abercrombie Fizzwidget he's the founder of Megacorp.</p><p>He offers Ratchet training which is Martial Arts, Heavy Weaponry, Stealth, Camouflage, Survival, Ballroom Dancing, and Origami. Clank takes the apartment on another planet.</p><p>After the training Fizzwidget tells Ratchet that a thief stole an experiment called the protopet. Ratchet gets coordinates to a flying lab on the planet Aranos. Here he battles a few robots until he comes to find the experiment inside a small cage.</p><p>Here the thief reveals himself and Ratchet jumps down a tube to escape leaving the protopet. While still exploring the lab Ratchet comes to a hallway where 2 robots sneak behind him then he jumps off the lab calling his ship with his gadget then escapes the planet.</p><p>Ratchet called Fizzwidget and told him that the thief escaped and he had no idea where he went. Ratchet gets coordinates from Fizzwidget to go to a planet where a Megacorp store is.</p><p>As Ratchet traverses he gets to the store and he sees Fizzwidget who gives him coordinates to a place that looks like a casino. While there Ratchet fights a group of people called the Thugs-for-less.</p><p>As he fights through them he gets to the arena where he needs to win a gadget that repairs machines and vehicles. When he wins the challenges he repairs the bridges but when he's about to repair the second bridge he stops at this machine that takes pictures.</p><p>When he takes one though he sees an image on the screen of the thief and Clank. The thief says to stay out of his way. Ratchet then rushes to save Clank.</p><p>As he traverses the planet he fights the leader of the Thugs-for-less. After he defeats him he continues his search for Clank. When Ratchet finally gets to Clank Ratchet tries to find a way to get to him without jumping over the ledge and not being able to get back up.</p><p>The thief then sneaks behind Ratchet and pushes him down to Clank. Ratchet seeing Clank isn't moving goes to repair him. Clank's systems then come online with the first thing he says is the value of pie is... then he doesn't finish what he says when he sees Ratchet. No where to go Clank sees an opening where he can climb up and open the door letting Ratchet out.</p><p>When Clank climbs up he sees enemies to big for him to take out so he finds little robots called Gadgebots to help him. As Clank explores he finally finds something to open the door. After he opens the door Clank &amp; Ratchet then go to a number of planets before they finally encounter the the thief on the planet Siberius.</p><p>Ratchet &amp; Clank fight the thief winning eventually. When they win the thief drifts away on his hoverboard unconcious and they free the protopet. When they return it to Fizzwidget he accidentally destroys there ship and ejects them out of his ship into a cave underground.</p><p>Clank then says he did that on purpose but Ratchet stays optimistic. Underground Ratchet &amp; Clank find a new wrench for Ratchet with a confusing brainteaser but they just bust it open.</p><p>When they get to the surface the thief comes on his ship but trips revealing that he is really a she. She says her name is Angela Cross and she wants the protopet. When they say they don't have it she says they just put the whole galaxy in danger then leaves a holovid screen to explain.</p><p>When they find their ship in pieces a strange mystic says he can fix it but he will need 10 crystals from the desert. After they get them he fixes there ship with magic. Then they head to the planet Dobbo.</p><p>There they find out Angela's claims were true when they see the protopet eating 2 scientists who work for Megacorp. Then they find out it is going to be released to everyone who wants one. They head to planet Boldan to try to reason with Fizzwidget on stopping the release.</p><p>They get arrested by the Thugs for attempting to bump off a robot look alike of Fizzwidget. The Thugs then show the the 2 a infobot of there new prison which looks like a prisoners paradise.After Clank creates a distraction to help both of them escape they see a transmission of Angela on the Thugs-for-less's fleet of ships. She gets caught and Ratchet and Clank go save her.</p><p>After they destroy all the ships they find out she wasn't on them but she was at the Thug's HQ. When they get there and defeat a few Thugs to find Angela they get to this gigantic robot with Angela trapped in the chest. After the duo shoot the robot with a few turrets placed around the planet they free Angela and head to her home planet to get her I.D card to infiltrate the Megacorp H.Q.</p><p>After they get the card they head to the H.Q to stop the protopet once and for all. When they get to the protopet they get captured and they find Fizzwidget. Then Fizzwidget takes off his disguise who reveals himself to actually be Captain Quark.</p><p>Angela then says \"What the F* is going on here.\" Quark then says he wants to restore his glory as a hero and make Ratchet, Clank, and Angela public enemy number 1. When Quark takes Angela's Helix-o-morph (the gadget that's going to make the protopet a nonviolent creature) and zaps the protopet he makes a gigantic monster.</p><p>The monster then eats Quark and jumps away. Ratchet and Clank then beat the protopet who spits out Quark. Angela then says it's going to take months of research to figure out what's wrong with the Helix-o-morph. Clank then says the batteries were in backwards. After the quick flip of batteries Angela changes the protopet back to normal.</p><p>The real Fizzwidget appears who was really tied up and stuffed in a broom closet. Ratchet then repairs the infobot who got destroyed during that time.</p><p>Back at Clank's apartment Ratchet, Clank, Angela, and the infobot talk. Ratchet starts to wonder what they did with Quark. Angela then says they made him test some machines. The infobot then show's them what happened.</p><p>Quark ends up testing Megacorps new invention the Crotchitizer. This leaves Quark feeling a lot of pain during and after, thus ending another one of Ratchet &amp; Clank's adventures.</p><h2>Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal</h2><p>While playing chess Ratchet &amp; Clank see Clank's new holovid show Secret Agent Clank. After that show Ratchet changes the channel to a news report on his home planet Veldin. It seems it is being attacked by the Tyhrranoids and the lead suspect is an evil villain by the name of Dr.Nefarious.</p><p>After that Ratchet &amp; Clank put the warp drive on their ship and head back to their galaxy. When they get there Ratchet is mistaken for the new Galactic Rangers sergeant. They give Ratchet 2 new weapons. After that he dispatches a few enemies and is greeted by the president.</p><p>He gives them a task to find the only man who has ever defeated Dr.Nefarious, Captain Quark. He gives the duo coordinates to the planet Florana. After traversing a few swamps and fighting off enemies Ratchet &amp; Clank finally come face to face with Quark but it seems he has lost his memory and he tells them to go through the Path of Death.</p><p>After they traverse a few death defying jumps and traps they come face to face with Quark again. This time they fight him to make him come with them. When they beat Quark Clank tells Ratchet to keep his mask on to make Quark follow them.</p><p>They then get coordinates to the Starship Pheonix. After they lock up Quark in there quarters Ratchet &amp; Clank go meet Sasha the person in charge of the Starship Pheonix. After they meet her they get assigned a mission to go help the president fight off the Tyhrranoids with the Galactic Rangers.</p><p>When they help out and destroy every last Tyhrranoid the president sends them to go and fix the shields. When they fix everything and defeat a few more Tyhrranoids that were inside they meet Al again. He gives them a Captain Quark holovid game for there system back at there quarters.</p><p>When they play and beat it though Quark gets his memory back. After that he creates a team called the Q-force. In it is Al, Helga, Skidd, Ratchet, Clank, Qwark, and Sasha. They then get assigned a mission to infiltrate Nefarious's underwater base on the planet Aquatos.</p><p>When they get there they find out Nefarious is Clanks biggest fan and they find an encrypted star map to the Tyhrranoids' home planet and base, Tyhrranosis. When they get back to the Pheonix Quark has drawn up another plan. This time their going to destroy the Tyhrranoids home base.</p><p>After Ratchet &amp; Clank sky dive into the battle field and destoy all the turrets they come face to face with the Momma Tyhrranoid. When they defeat it they head back to the Pheonix to tell there story. During there story Nefarious interupts them and Al traces the transmission back to the source, the planet Daxx.</p><p>They find out about the Biobliterator here. They then head to the Obani Moons. When they get to the end Skidd shows up and tells them to go and that he would take care of the Omega Shield blocking access to the Obani Draco.</p><p>They then go to Annihalation Nation to meet Courtney Gears to get information on Dr.Nefarious. She tells them she'll give them information only if Clank can get her a part on Secret Agent Clank. Then they go to Holostar Studios for filming. Ratchet gets fired from his role after pushing the ejector seat button, again. When Clank is finished though Courtney Gears knocks him out and replaces him with a look alike called Klunk.</p><p>When Ratchet sees someone he thinks is Clank they go to help out Skidd in the Obani Draco where Courtney Gears has captured him. When they get there though it's too late Gears has turned Skidd into a robot. Then she tries to do the same with Ratchet but he quickly defeats her and takes Skidd back to the Pheonix.</p><p>Sasha then tracks Nefarious down to a cruiser in the Zeldrin Starport called the Leviathan. When the duo get there they see Quark and Skrunch the monkey talking. Skrunch says something and Quark said \"I thought we agreed we would never bring this up again.\" Then Skrunch says something angrily. Quark says \"It was mating season how was I supposed to know she was your sister.\" Quark then says to Ratchet &amp; the Clank look alike how long were you standing there. Clank says \"Too long.\" They then get on Quark's ship and confront Nefarious.</p><p>Nefarious after talking to them sets the self-destruct sequence for the cruiser. Quark tells them to go on because he's looking for something. After waiting long enough on the ship they go on to save thereselves after the cruiser explodes.</p><p>After that they go to Metropolis which is under attack by Nefarious. Nefarious then turns the whole city into robots except Ratchet who was hiding behind a wall. Ratchet then confronts Nefarious and notices Clank is in a cage. Then Ratchet fights and defeats Klunk and frees Clank.</p><p>After traveling to a few planets, finding out Quark is alive, and Clank destroying the Biobliterator with an Ion cannon on the planet Koros Sasha tells them something depressing. There's another Biobliterator that's more powerful than the first. Ratchet &amp; Clank then go to the planet Mylon to defeat Nefarious once and for all. After beating a few Tyhrranoids and hacking the system. Ratchet and Clank come face to face with Nefarious.</p><p>After shooting Nefarious with a few rounds he says he gives up. Then he runs away. After chasing him through many waves of enemies they finally defeat Nefarious but he warps himself into the newly transformed Biobliterator. Quark then comes to help by dropping off a few ships for Ratchet &amp; Clank. They then destroy the Biobliterator and Nefarious and his butler are stuck on a meteor for a few thousand years. The Q-force then go to the premiere of Clank's Secret Agent Clank movie ending another one of the duos adventures.</p><h3><span id=\"Ratchet_.26_Clank_Future:_Tools_of_Destruction\"><i>Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</i></span><span></span></h3><p>The series' next generation installment began with Clank at Ratchet's side, helping him with a new high speed vehicle on Planet Kerwan. Captain Qwark then contacted the duo and told them about heavily armed robotic commandos attacking the Planetary Defense Center. At the Defense Centre, attacking Drophyd walkers' sensors identified Ratchet as a Lombax and Clank as a toaster.</p><p>After being taken on the high-jacked Emperor Tachyon's ship to the Polaris System, Clank met a race of interdimensional aliens called the Zoni that only he could see. Ratchet discounted Clank's mentioning of invisible aliens believeing he had been damaged in the crash landing on Cobalia. He suggested that Clank should see Big Al after their adventure was over.</p><p>Throughout their travels in the Polaris Galaxy, the Zoni granted Clank with more devices to help Ratchet on his quest such as the Geo Laser and Robo Wings. When Clank was sent off to venture without Ratchet in smaller places, the Zoni also showed up to help him, similar to that of the Gadgebots from past games. Clank also gained the ability to slow time and could command the Zoni to manipulate' their surroundings to help Clank progress, levitate Clank to glide across gaps and energize machinery. The Zoni also gave Clank visions of the future which allowed him to have knowledge of the Cragmite return and prevent Talwyn Apogee from perishing in Zordoom Prison. The Zoni would usually refer to Clank as \"sire\" or \"chosen one\". After Ratchet had defeated Emperor Tachyon and destroyed the Dimensionator and saved the galaxy once more, the Zoni suddenly appeared, visible to all. The suddenly placed Clank in a strange energy field and began to take him away. Despite Ratchet's best efforts to save him, Clank disappeared through an interdimensional portal to parts unknown.</p><h3><span id=\"Ratchet_.26_Clank_Future:_Quest_for_Booty\"><i>Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Quest for Booty</i></span><span></span></h3><p>Clank made only two appearances in this game, the first being the time when Ratchet was washed up on the beach when Clank appeared, and asked him if he was alright, but then disappeared. This may have been a hallucination. The second time was in a dark room with the Zoni, when he was blubbering weirdly, when the Zoni then said \"the doctor\" would fix him. Shortly after that, Dr. Nefarious stepped into the room and then fell down the stairs, ending the game.</p><h3><span id=\"Ratchet_.26_Clank_Future:_A_Crack_in_Time\"><i>Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time</i></span><span></span></h3><p>After parts of the Great Clock were destroyed by Nefarious and his machinery, Clank woke up after being suspended inside the facility for over a year. The robot tried to escape from Nefarious's clutches but was immobilized before he could do so. When Clank woke again, he had been reactivated by a robot named Sigmund, the Junior Caretaker of the Great Clock. Clank learned of his location from Sigmund and traveled with him around the Great Clock.</p><p>Clank would eventually enter a Mnemonic Chamber which would allow him to enter his own sub-conscious. Here, Clank learned he had a father named Orvus and that he had become the Senior Caretaker of the Great Clock and had \"inherited\" the facility from Orvus. Clank was given a Chronoscepter by Orvus, allowing him to manipulate time in order to overcome the various obstacles in his path. The Chronoscepter also functions as a weapon and can be used to fix broken objects throughout the Great Clock.</p><p>Clank would then travel around the Great Clock with Sigmund, fixing time anomalies of various planets before learning that Orvus left for Dr. Nefarious's outpost on Zanifar and did not return. During the use of a mnemonic chamber, Clank encountered the Plumber, who advised him not to \"risk any more than 6 minutes\". Ratchet then contacted Clank shortly after using an Obsidian Eye and was told to use a time portal on Zanifar to save Orvus.</p><p>Clank and Sigmund then made their way to the Orvus Chamber, a room which acted like the main control room for the Great Clock. He watched a message left by Orvus warning that misuse of the Clock would tear apart reality. However, before Clank could watch the rest of the message, he was captured by Lawrence, who serves as a butler to Nefarious, and placed in custody of the Valkyries. Ratchet and Alister Azimuth battled the Valkyries at their Citadel on planet Vapedia and set Clank free. After being re-united with Ratchet, Clank learned that Orvus had disappeared from Nefarious's clutches and that he couldn't do anything to save him. Thanking Ratchet for trying anyway, Clank managed to persuade him not to use the Clock to save the Lombaxes with Azimuth, fearing it would be a repeat of the incident with the Dimensionator.</p><p>Clank then traveled with Ratchet to Nefarious's station where they engaged Doctor Nefarious and Lawrence in combat. The duo was victorious and were narrowly saved from death themselves by Azimuth. Back on the Great Clock, Clank said that he needed to stay at the facility as it was what he was built for. Ratchet reluctantly agreed and started to walk Clank in. Azimuth, outraged at Ratchet's unwillingness to turn back time, suddenly snapped and sent an energy blast from his wrench at Ratchet. Clank could do nothing as he watched his best friend die.</p><p>Clank managed to avoid similar attacks from Azimuth, race to the Orvus Chamber, and seal the room off from the General. Clank then remembered the Plumber's advice, realizing it was crucial advice about reversing the flow of time. Breaking Orvus's rule on not using the Clock as a time machine, Clank initiated a time shift to reverse time for 6 minutes. Watching the energy slowly flow into the Universe, he barely manages to push Ratchet to the ground as the energy blast shoots overhead. He then helps Ratchet defeat Azimuth in a final battle while the Orvus Chamber falls apart around them.</p><p>After Azimuth sacrificed himself to repair the damage to the Clock, Clank bid a forlorn farewell to Ratchet as the Lombax sadly walked away forever. Clank, however, realized that finding his own family didn't mean that he could abandon Ratchet. As a recording of Orvus advised Clank to do what is meaningful to him, Clank promoted Sigmund to Senior Caretaker of the Clock by giving him the Chronoscepter and then chased after Ratchet, making it into <i>Aphelion</i>, Ratchet's spacecraft, just before the canopy closed. The two heroes then blasted off together into the stars for another adventure.</p><h3><span id=\"Ratchet_.26_Clank:_All_4_One\"><i>Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One</i></span><span></span></h3><p>In <i>All 4 One</i>, Clank, Ratchet, Qwark, and Dr. Nefarious were captured by Ephemeris after Nefarious' evil plan backfired in Luminopolis. Clank's appearance has changed to match <i>All 4 One'</i>s art style, and is slightly larger than in previous.</p>",

But their second stroke of genius, in some ways even more original and full of potential developments of the first, date in March 1963 and is named Eva Kant. A woman as only two women could invent, different from all the heroines that preceded it and all those who try in vain to imitate the charm.</p><p>No other character has been so punctually in deams and aspirations of the Italian boys.</p><p>Blonde, beautiful, green eyes, the companion of the King of Terror is the first episode No 3, \"The arrest of Diabolik \"; which looks like a fascinating and ambiguous widow of Lord Kant. Shows an immediate coolness and determination equal to that of Diabolik, saved in extremis by the guillotine. In time soften its image with a refined and mysterious sensuality, antithetical to all vulgarity, building a solid and couple relationship based on sharing the same lifestyle. A strong and independent woman, even then, but agrees to remain in the shadows of the King of Crime. But only the beginning, mind you, because, in register and register every year, readers can follow his path emancipation, outside and inside. best: retreat.</p><p>Today Eva Kant can be independent, to shine its light, even on the side of Diabolik.

Then the operation &quot;official&quot; was stopped in the bud (perhaps by a jealous and envious Diabolik), but he had a creeping development. Increasingly, then, Eve, was the main character of significant episodes of regular series (one for all: The shadow of death, 4 of 1994, when Diabolik is due out on pages 100 to 120) and has become the privileged testimonial disclosure manuals (When a woman has to defend in 2001) of advertising campaigns (Renault Twingo), promotional calendars (Faac 2002), music videos (Tiromancino) and many other initiatives.</p><p>But the consecration of the success was the conquest of a magazine, consistent with a title: in 2003 it appeared on newsstands, and with great success, the special register EVA KANT - WHEN THERE WAS NOT DIABOLIK.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Spencer Keen was a college student in 1852. He was son to Doctor Keen of Midwest College. His superhero costume was the originally the suit Keen picked for a costume ball. He decided to visit his father before the dance. His father shared with him his newest discovery, \"the blue blaze\". He had experimented with subjecting mice and insects to the blaze. They seemed to die immediately, only to revive months later, stronger than ever. The Dr. was uncertain what to do with his discovery. That night a tornado swept down the city. Dr. Keen was killed along with most of the population. But Spencer was knocked into the path of the Blaze and fell to the same death-like sleep as the test subjects. He was buried in haste along with the other dead left behind by the tornado.</p><p>While Keen slept, his body changed. His strength increased \"a thousand fold\", his body became invulnerable and bulletproof. In 1940, Spencer awoke and rose from his grave. Discovering the world had changed in 88 yeas but needed heroes. In his tales the Blue Blaze faced Professor Maluski and his zombies, the ice ray guns of \"crackpot inventor\" Barko and Dr. Gair the mastermind of the crime syndicate. His final adventure was against Dr. Vortex, a manipulator orchestrating a conflict between Borsia and Gratzia, two fictional countries of the Balkans.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Zara was one of the various jungle girls emerging in the wake of Sheena's popularity. She was reportedly brought up in the jungles of Africa by her widowed father. He deemed the cities of the world too corrupt and crime-ridden for a young girl to be safe. She was taught to live in the wilderness and to rely on no help for survival. She carried a bow and quiver, using it to both hunt and fight.</p><p>In her first appearance she helped Captain Jeff Graves of the colonial army in his efforts to stop a savage conflict between two local tribes. They found out the war was orchestrated by Bwana Gombo. Gombo was a white man whose actual cause was to weaken both tribes. He would then take over the tribes and the lands with the help of a few mercenaries. In the next issue Zara and Graves faced Arab slave traders.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Zara is a Marvel comics character that was first introduced in Mystic Comics #2 released in 1940. She is jointly created by Newt Alfred.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Zara possesses no extra powers or abilities, but instead possesses an extremely high level of fitness and athleticism for that of a human. A skilled and capable hand to hand fighter Zara also possesses ability and skills as an archer. Zara has survived and lived in African jungles and is thus a capable survivor and hunter.</p>",

It's gravity was holding the Lakul and another transport ship in it's grasp.</p><p>They were rescued by the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/uss-enterprise/4055-54366/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-54366\">USS Enterprise</a> NCC-1701-B on it's maiden voyage. They were only able to save 47 out of hundreds who died on those ships, but only thanks to retired Starfleet captain, <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/james-t-kirk/4005-20078/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20078\">James T. Kirk</a>'s quick thinking. While the Enterprise was stuck in the ribbon, Soran and many of the other refugees wanted to desperately go back to their ships to get back to the ribbon. Though Soran and the others were saved, the rescue mission seemingly cost Kirk his life.</p><h4>Returns to the Ribbion</h4><p>Nearly 80 years later, Soran tried to get back to the ribbon for he was still obsessed. He tried everything he could think of to return to the ribbon. Though he finally found a way. First he had to make a pact with two treacherous <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/klingons/4060-56525/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56525\">Klingon</a> women, The Duras sisters, Lursa and B'Etor. The deal was to help him out in exchange for a trilithium weapon, one with the power to destroy an entire solar system. However, the station Soran was working on was attacked by <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/romulans/4060-23900/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23900\">Romulans</a> who were looking for their missing trilithirm. The <a href=\"/uss-enterprise-d/4055-56889/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56889\">USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D</a> at the station, but arrived to late to save much of the crew.</p><p>However, they did not get their weapon. Soran would later return to the station and launched the weapon at a star, destroying the system. The sun going nova made a shockwave which pushed the course of the Nexus ribbon. He was later picked up by the Duras sisters. <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/jean-luc-picard/4005-20105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20105\">Jean-Luc Picard</a> and <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/data/4005-20109/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20109\">Data</a> figured out his next move. He was going to destroy the Veridian star, which would destroy the system. The result of the explosion was going to push it toward an uninhabited would known as Veridian III, however it was going to destroy another planet, Veridian IV which had 230,000,000 humanoids living on it's surface.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79730/2234084-1a_soran_enters_the_nexus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234084\" data-ratio=\"0.42125\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.1%\" href=\"https://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79730/2234084-1a_soran_enters_the_nexus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234084\"><img alt=\"Soran and Picard enter into the Nexus\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79730/2234084-1a_soran_enters_the_nexus.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/79730/2234084-1a_soran_enters_the_nexus.jpg 800w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/79730/2234084-1a_soran_enters_the_nexus.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-width=\"800\"></a><figcaption>Soran and Picard enter into the Nexus</figcaption></figure><p>Picard beamed down to Veridian III to try to reason with him, but to no success. After he lost in a fight with Soran, the weapon was launched and it destroyed the sun and the system, which only because of the ribbon pulling them in, Picard and Soran were the only survivors.</p><h4>Death</h4><p>Picard emerged from the Ribbon at some point to try again before he fought Soren and brought former Enterprise captain, James T. Kirk with him. While Kirk fought Soren, Picard sabotaged the weapon's launcher. But Soren's actions lead to the death of James T. Kirk by destroying the bridge that Kirk used to get to the detonator of the missile. Soran died when Picard locked the missile onto the launcher, instead of running Soran excepted his fate and died when the launcher exploded.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Agent David Sum was born Hui Lin in the year 1320. In January 1368 he helped Zhu Yuanzhang run Kublai Khan out of China. Because of his extreme longevity he has lived to this day and has become a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" slug=\"shield\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> operative and member of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\" href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" slug=\"ms-marvel\">Ms. Marvel</a>'s strike team, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58731\" href=\"/operation-lightning-storm/4060-58731/\" slug=\"operation-lightning-storm\">Operation: Lighting Storm</a></p><h2>Operation Lightning Storm</h2><p>Ms. Marvel proposed the idea of an strike team to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\" href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" slug=\"iron-man\">Tony Stark</a> to quell villains before they increased to a bigger issue the Avengers had to deal with. Ms. Marvel personally picked David Sum from the SHIELD roster. When Ms. Marvel took interest in Sum she had to probe him to figure out his expertise, while it remained vague to the rest of the strike team.</p><p>His first combat mission was taking down <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\" href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" slug=\"aim\">A.I.M.</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41566\" href=\"/monica-rappaccini/4005-41566/\" slug=\"monica-rappaccini\">Monica Rappaccini</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\" href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" slug=\"modok\">M.O.D.O.K.</a> with Ms. Marvel and the the squad. Despite his teammate, Agent Locke's injury and medical leave, Agent Sum told Ms. Marvel he wanted to stay. The A.I.M. mission was the first time the squad, including Ms. Marvel grew suspicious of his enhanced abilities.</p><p>Agent Sum' second mission was in Puerto Maravilla, Chile in pursuit of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3799\" href=\"/puppet-master/4005-3799/\" slug=\"puppet-master\">Puppet Master</a> with Lightning Force, added the new members <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7242\" href=\"/machine-man/4005-7242/\" slug=\"machine-man\">Machine Man</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7601\" href=\"/sleepwalker/4005-7601/\" slug=\"sleepwalker\">Sleepwalker</a> (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-18284\" href=\"/rick-sheridan/4005-18284/\" slug=\"rick-sheridan\">Rick Sheridan</a>). Sleepwalker, Machine Man and Agent Sum scoped Downtown Puerto Maravilla. A mind controlled <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40598\" href=\"/spider-girl/4005-40598/\" slug=\"spider-girl\">Arana</a> spotted Agent Sum while fetching groceries and attacked the trio in a bar. The trio took Arana back to Puppet Master's seaside estate as Ms. Marvel was being attacked by another puppeteered hero, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40516\" href=\"/stature/4005-40516/\" slug=\"stature\">Stature</a>. While Ms. Marvel duked it out with Stature, Agent Sum fought <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21188\" href=\"/tigra/4005-21188/\" slug=\"tigra\">Tigra</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11341\" href=\"/silverclaw/4005-11341/\" slug=\"silverclaw\">Silverclaw</a> on the front lawn with Machine Man and Sleepwalker. At the closing of the mission it's suggested Agent Sum wanted to share his healing secret with Ms. Marvel.</p><p>After completing the mission and returning to Helicarrier 9 an unknown object crashes into the airship. Agent Sum rushes to Ms. Marvel's room realizing her room was the targeted impact. He arrives as Ms. Marvel is mid-battle with the sentient alien <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40530\" href=\"/cru/4005-40530/\" slug=\"cru\">Cru,</a> who she carries history with. Cru quickly dismisses Agent Sum from the fight disintegrating the flesh from his bones with one energy blast. Soon enough Agnet Sum emerges in the flesh with most of his uniform burned off, similar to how <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\" href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" slug=\"wonder-man\">Wonder Man</a> saw him at the A.I.M. base. Machine Man is the first to discover his miraculous recovery also maimed from a Cru attack. He learns from Machine Man that Cru had taken Ms. Marvel as they retreat to Machine Man's quarters for his back-up \"L.M.D.\", Life Model Decoy.</p><p>After regrouping, Agent Sum, Man Machine and the unexpected guest, Arana and Wonder Man, mediate on a plan to locate Ms. Marvel. Agent Sum deals with the stubborn Arana on her teenage responsibilities and she concocts an alien contaminate excuse to stay on the helicarrier. This excuse gives Agent Sum the idea to trace Ms. Marvel through Cru's unique alien energy signature. Sum's theory works and they trace her location to Monster Island situated in the Bermuda triangle.</p><h2>Skills &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Agent Sum is a trained SHIELD member</p><h2><b>Powers</b></h2><p>Unexplained and very effective healing powers.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Élan DeJunae was a daughter in the DeJunae crime family in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56960\" href=\"/south-america/4020-56960/\" slug=\"south-america\">South America</a>. She and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11552\" href=\"/normie-osborn/4005-11552/\" slug=\"normie-osborn\">Normie Osborn</a> were set to have an arrange marriage since their childhoods. Her father has connections to the Order of the Goblin. As Élan got older, she started to follow in Norman Osborn's footsteps and she also gained connections with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8669\" href=\"/black-tarantula/4005-8669/\" slug=\"black-tarantula\">Black Tarantula</a>. She eventually attacked Normie Osborn, nearly killing him. She planned to follow through on the arranged marriage but Normie never found out about the arranged marriage. Fury and Black Tarantula made a plan to have Spider-Girl take down <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15649\" href=\"/carolyn-trainer/4005-15649/\" slug=\"carolyn-trainer\">Lady Octopus</a> and Canis so they can rule the criminal underworld. Fury also used plans made by Norman Osborn (before his death). Fury attempted to dose Normie with a new <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56623\" href=\"/goblin-formula/4055-56623/\" slug=\"goblin-formula\">Goblin Formula</a>. Spider-Girl defeated Fury before Normie got the dose and the dose exploded. Unfortunately for Spider-Girl, Fury escaped.</p><p>Normie and Brenda Draco (AKA <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8668\" href=\"/raptor/4005-8668/\" slug=\"raptor\">Raptor</a>) were getting married, when Fury crashed the wedding. She wanted revenge because she was not being let into the goblin legacy. She had the Venom-Symbiote and forced it onto Normie. Her plan backfired when she found out that Normie gained control over the symbiote. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2246\" href=\"/phil-urich/4005-2246/\" slug=\"phil-urich\">Phil Urich</a> came as a Green Goblin and defeated Fury and sent her to prison, h owever, was able to out smart Fury and defeated her but she later freed by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57548\" href=\"/goblin-cult/4060-57548/\" slug=\"goblin-cult\">Cult of the Green Goblin</a>.</p><p>Fury the Goblin Queen activates a signal that awakens the Mayday inhabiting the tank within Osborn's labs, and she escapes, confronting Mayday on the roof of her high school just as she is changing into Spider-Girl. Having been caught in the heart of an explosion that decimates New York City, a critically injured Mayday, her costume torn away by the impact, is rescued from the debris by Araña's forces. Araña, realizing that Mayday might not survive her ordeal, offers to merge with her, but she intervenes in a vision quest that Mayday is undergoing, and by aiding her overcome a force she was meant to overcome alone, she obstructs Spider-Girl from uncovering whether or not she is the true Mayday. Araña successfully completes the merging and temporaraly assumes control of Mayday's body, leaving Mayday and a third, blond woman who shares her name (possibly the spirit of Aunt May) trapped within her own subliminal consciousness before regaining control of her body. Meanwhile, The Changeling assumes Mayday's life and picks up where she left off, however her presence deeply disturbs Benjy and a crestfallen Mayday also discovers that she has split up with Gene. Gene angrily retaliates when Mayday visits him, forcing her to take physical action and slam him through a table, which produces adulation and applause from the crowd. She later receives a call from Normie, telling her about the capture of Peter Parker, leading the Changeling into assuming the role of Spider-Girl. While the body-swapped Mayday in Araña tries to find Araña within her own body, who is using her body as a trap to defeat the Black Tarantula. However, the body-swapped May was found by the Changeling leading into a battle between the two of them, just as the body swapped Araña is lead into the lair of the Black Tarantula. The Black Tarantula was able to see through Araña's trick and nearly knocks her unconscious, just as May in Araña's body was knocked unconscious as well leading the two of them to recover their original bodies. Meanwhile, Normie Osborne, along with Kaine, Phil Urich (in his Green Goblin Costume), Darkdevil, and Normie's wife Raptor, tried to rescue Peter Parker from Fury's hands, unaware of the the fact that Peter has absorbed the mind and memories of the original Norman Osborn. This leads to a fight between the assembled heroes and Peter, now possessed by the Green Goblin. Mayday arrives just as Peter/Green Goblin reunites with The Changeling, who is revealed to have been genetically spliced with the DNA of the Venom symbiote, giving her the metamorphic powers displayed by Spidercide, but without the need for a host like normal symbiotes. Bonding with his \"daughter\" (and, unintentionally, Spider-Girl), the possessed Peter declares himself as \"The Goblin God\" and begins to go on a rampage, while Mayday finds herself trapped within her father's mental psyche. With the aid of the spiritual avatar of her Great Aunt May Parker, as well as flashbacks to the day she healed Normie Osborn's psychological scars, Mayday and Peter are able to overcome Norman in a psychic duel and convince the Brand New May that Mayday is a good person. Norman is seemingly defeated, but not before he denies Mayday the chance to discover whenever or not she is the true daughter of Peter and Mary Jane, or the clone. Mary Jane is rescued from near-death by Benjy, who reveals he has developed organic webbing. With the Brand New May uncertain of her place, Mayday proposes she become a member of the Parker family, Mary Jane agrees, though Peter distrusts her and objects to the idea. Mayday takes a walk, reflecting on how her parents, baby brother, and potential new twin sister have overcome so much and truley become \"An Amazing Spider-Man Family\". Fury, later recovered and decided to start reclaiming her control over the Order of the Goblin. She started by kidnapping April Parker and revealing that she is in fact the real clone of May Parker. However, in going over the records she discovered that she had a younger sister who was also in line to be leader of the Order. Fury took off to Midtown High School and kidnapped Simone DeSantos, destroying her father's limo with him inside. Wes attampted to save Simone but instead was left to fall to his death after Fury knocked him off her glider. May was able to recover fast enough to catch Wes in mid air and save him. Fury in the mean time returned to her hide out and held Simone hostage while she placed a sonic bomb collar on April to manipulate her into killing May Parker. When May arrived as Spider-Girl with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8676\" href=\"/darkdevil/4005-8676/\" slug=\"darkdevil\">Dark Devil</a>. May was able to convince April to turn against Fury and she removed her collar and destroyed most of the hide out. May, then in a brutal battle with Fury was able to defeat her and disable her goblin armor. She was then captured by the FBI and so were several members of the Goblin Cult.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>The <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/borg/4060-58374/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58374\">Borg</a> Queen exhibits hierarchical command structure, instead using a structure similar in principle to the internet with no control center and distributed processing. <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/star-trek-first-contact/4025-152/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-152\"><em>Star Trek: First Contact</em></a> introduced the Borg Queen as the Borg Matriarch. The Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective consciousness and a unique drone within the collective, who originates from Species 125, that brings \"order to chaos\", referring to herself as \"we\" and \"I\" interchangeably.</p><h3>Star Trek First Contact</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/654494-borgqueen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-654494\" data-ratio=\"1.5821114369501\" data-width=\"682\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 682px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/654494-borgqueen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-654494\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33224/654494-borgqueen001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33224/654494-borgqueen001.jpg 682w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33224/654494-borgqueen001.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33224/654494-borgqueen001.jpg 404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" data-width=\"404\"></a></figure><p>The Borg Queen is seen as apparently present during <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/jean-luc-picard/4005-20105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20105\">Picard</a>'s former assimilation at the start as flashbacks in Picard's mind (a character formerly assimilated by the collective who's link was not completely severed), and was believed destroyed along with that <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/borg-cubes/4055-56808/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56808\">Borg cube</a> years earlier. Here, she instead directs her attentions to <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/data/4005-20109/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20109\">Data</a>. After his capture by her drones, she tries to tempt him with live flesh to comply with her. This Queen is destroyed when her organic components are melted off as a result of Data's deception. She is destroyed in the <a href=\"/uss-voyager/4055-56042/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56042\"><em>Voyager</em></a> episodes \"Dark Frontier\" and \"Endgame\", as well.</p><h3>Voyager</h3><p>In the Star: The Experience attraction <em>The Borg Invasion 4-D</em>, the Borg Queen re-appears after <em>Voyager</em> returns to the <a href=\"/alpha-quadrant/4020-56736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56736\">Alpha Quadrant</a>, but as Admiral <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kathryn-janeway/4005-20071/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20071\">Janeway</a> attempts to kill her, she activates a transporter, allowing her to survive.</p><p>In the <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> relaunch novels, the Borg Queen isn't a single, irreplaceable entity, but the product of a program called \"The Royal Protocol\" that shares its name with a <a href=\"/starfleet/4060-51128/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51128\">Starfleet</a> document outlining requirements when dealing with foreign royalty. This program is used to create a Borg Queen from any female Borg, commanding the technology within her to alter and adapt to the Protocol's specifications.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p>In the relaunch novels, one of the leaders of Starfleet Intelligence gets her hands on \"The Royal Protocol\" and, with the use of an Emergency Medical Hologram, turns herself into a new kind of Borg Queen who cares about and loves her drones.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><p>Alternatively, in the game <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/star-trek-legacy/3030-7690/\">Star Trek Legacy</a>, bonus content unlock-able through the course of the game further explains the role of the queen. It is suggested that the females of a particular species have a natural ability to filter and control the immense 'traffic' of thought present in the collective consciousness of the Borg. These females, in a sense, serve as regulators or signal boosters even, assisting in maintaining the complete consciousness over the thousands of light years of Borg space.</p><p>This also presents the possibility of multiple queens, which would be a suitable explanation for why two separate Starfleet captains have 'killed the queen'. In the illustration accompanying the explanation, all the females distinctly resemble the queen portrayed on screen.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Biography</h2><p>Though two years younger than <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\" href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\" slug=\"obi-wan-kenobi\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, Tachi was just as powerful in her skills with lightsaber and the Force. As an adolescent, she had a very tomboyish attitude, even while considered attractive by her male peers. As with Kenobi, Tachi had a rivalry with fellow Jedi trainee Bruck Chun.</p><p>The first time Tachi spoke to Kenobi, she had already learned of his temporary leave from the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41234\" href=\"/jedi-order/4060-41234/\" slug=\"jedi-order\">Jedi Order</a> to help the adolescents on Melida/Daan to halt the civil war on the planet, and was angry with him, calling him an embarrassment to all potential Padawans (this was before she was chosen as a Padawan herself). Later on, she helped him trace Bruck Chun's connection in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70284\" href=\"/xanatos/4005-70284/\" slug=\"xanatos\">Xanatos</a>' infiltration of the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56425\" href=\"/jedi-temple/4020-56425/\" slug=\"jedi-temple\">Jedi Temple</a>.</p><p>A few months following the Xanatos incident, Jedi Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5401\" href=\"/adi-gallia/4005-5401/\" slug=\"adi-gallia\">Adi Gallia</a> chose Tachi to be her Padawan learner. The two accompanied Kenobi and his master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5411\" href=\"/qui-gon-jinn/4005-5411/\" slug=\"qui-gon-jinn\">Qui-Gon Jinn</a> on several missions to planets such as Kegan, Simpla-12, and Sorrus. With Adi Gallia, Tachi helped Kenobi rescue Jinn from the Force-obsessed scientist Jenna Zan Arbor. Later, Kenobi saved her from the bounty hunter Ona Nobis. Before this mission, Tachi was a headstrong and impatient Padawan, having difficulty understanding when to refrain from a fight, but learning from Kenobi's example, she became more patient and prudent .</p><p>It was not until a few years into their friendship that Tachi and Kenobi realized their true feelings for each other. Along with their masters, the two were again sent on a mission together: this time to save a boy, Talesan Fry, from bounty hunters on the planet Cirrus. After crashing on the planet Quadrant Seven, the masters sent the Padawans to hide in the nearby caves in order to protect Fry. During the time they spent in the caves, Tachi and Kenobi's bickering briefly allowed them to express their feelings for each other, but they decided to put their focus on the mission. At one point in the mission, the Padawans and Fry were on board a ship rigged to blow up if it exited hyperspace. It was during this time of potential death that Tachi and Kenobi truly recognized their feelings and after finding a way to land the ship safely, they confirmed that they were in love. They agreed to discuss their situation more in depth after the mission was over. After putting Fry into safe hands (following the death of his parents at the hands of the bounty hunter Magus), the two agreed to abandon their love, after a talk with Jinn and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5396\" href=\"/yoda/4005-5396/\" slug=\"yoda\">Yoda</a> about the consequences of Jinn's love for the late Jedi Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81406\" href=\"/tahl/4005-81406/\" slug=\"tahl\">Tahl</a>. Tachi and Kenobi vowed never to speak of their love again. However, this decision led to the gradual drifting of their friendship.</p><p>Shortly after the Invasion of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56385\" href=\"/naboo/4020-56385/\" slug=\"naboo\">Naboo</a>, Tachi and Adi Gallia had a major disagreement, which led to Gallia dismissing her informally as Padawan, and Tachi leaving the Jedi Order. She joined the slave trader <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3827\" href=\"/krayn/4005-3827/\" slug=\"krayn\">Krayn</a> and renamed herself Zora. Tachi remained a part of his operations as his right-hand person until she briefly encountered Kenobi and his new apprentice, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\" href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\" slug=\"darth-vader\">Anakin Skywalker</a>. Kenobi, like most other Jedi, had believed that Tachi was a traitor. However, after the encounter with Zora and lashing out at her, he later searched his feelings and realized the truth that Tachi would never willingly betray the Jedi. This was confirmed by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45051\" href=\"/the-jedi-high-council/4060-45051/\" slug=\"the-jedi-high-council\">Jedi High Council</a>, revealing that Tachi's \"disagreement\" with Adi Gallia and her \"dismissal\" from the Jedi Order were all part of an intricate plan set up by the Council to overthrow Krayn's slave operations. Soon after this revelation, Skywalker, who was captured earlier and made a slave, inadvertently disclosed the true identity of \"Zora,\" and Krayn imprisoned her with Skywalker. Working together, the two Jedi convinced the slaves to organize a revolt. With Kenobi's help from the outside, they succeeded in destroying Krayn's operations, ending with Skywalker killing the slaver. Her undercover mission finished, Tachi was welcomed back to the Jedi Order.</p><p>Upon her return, Tachi became a Jedi Knight, and she took Ferus Olin as her Padawan learner. They went on a number of missions together, along with Kenobi and Skywalker, to places such as Radnor and Euceron. One mission was when Tachi and Kenobi's apprentices infiltrated and posed as students at the Leadership School on Andara in order to discover the background behind the kidnapped son of a Senator. Tachi and Kenobi's part of the mission involved them posing as the king and queen of Cortella considering the enrollment of their \"children\" at the school.</p><p>Other missions that Tachi and Olin took included their rescue of Kenobi and Skywalker from Jenna Zan Arbor on Vanqor, their investigation of Zan Arbor, Roy Teda, and Granta Omega on Romin, and their investigation of Zan Arbor's Blacwater Systems laboratory on Falleen, before a crucial mission on Coruscant.</p><p>Following Omega, Zan Arbor, and Teda to the capital world, Tachi, Olin, Kenobi, and Skywalker discovered their plans to assassinate hundreds of Senators and dignitaries, including Supreme Chancellor Palpatine himself, using assassin droids assigned to specific targets. Tachi, Kenobi and Skywalker went off to find the trio of criminals while Olin valiantly protected the Chancellor and Senators from the droids (though there were some two dozen casualties). Following the death of Teda and another escape by Omega and Zan Arbor, the two master and apprentice pairs headed for Korriban, where the two criminals were reported to have been seen.</p><p>Along with Soara Amtana, Ry-Gaul, and their respective apprentices, Darra Thel- Tanis and Tru Veld, the investigation of the Jedi in Korriban's capital of Dreshdae led them to Omega and Zan Arbor in the Valley of the Dark Lords. It was during this fateful mission that Thel-Tanis was killed by Omega. After completing the mission (which resulted in Omega's death and Zan Arbor's escape) and returning to the Temple, Olin expressed his guilt over Thel-Tanis' death and announced that he was resigning from the Jedi Order.</p><p>After Olin's resignation, Tachi never took another Padawan. She mostly worked on solo missions and befriended the pilot Nym and his squadron, the Lok Revenants. Tachi helped them defeat the Trade Federation numerous times, but eventually she parted ways with them. However, Tachi fought alongside them again, with Adi Gallia and a number of other Jedi pilots, using the new Delta-7 Aethersprie starfighters. She was introduced to the Galactic Republic's new Clone Army and guarded the Republic transports with Gallia in space above Geonosis, where Kenobi, Skywalker, and Senator Padme Amidala were being held by Count Dooku's Confederacy of Independant Systems. Prior to the Batle of Geonosis, Tachi aided her former master Adi Gallia in thwarting Cavik Toth's fleet of Hex Deployers. This was the start of the Clone Wars.</p><p>Following the Battle of Geonosis, Tachi went to Kamino to investigate the sighting of Slave I, despite its owner Jango Fett having been killed by Mace Windu in the battle. While on Kamino, Tachi almost discovered Fett's son, Boba, but having been forewarned that a Jedi was arriving, he managed to elude her.</p><p>In 20 BBY, over two years into the Clone Wars, Tachi reunited with Kenobi and Skywalker, as well as Padmé Amidala, to go to the planet Genian. The Separatists were after an important codebreaking mechanism invented by Talesan Fry, whom Tachi and Kenobi had met decades earlier. Fry was now the founder of a very wealthy business on Genian, a world that remained neutral during the war. Reuniting with Fry brought back old memories to Kenobi and Tachi of the feelings that they once had for each other. After convincing Fry to give the device to the Republic, they were attacked by someone else from the past, the bounty hunter Magus, who had killed Fry's parents.</p><p>Fry accompanied the Jedi and Senator Amidala to Azure, where the Republic was fighting off more Separatists. While Kenobi, Skywalker, and Fry fought off the attack led by Magus (who was working for the Corporate Alliance), Tachi and Amidala took a starfighter of their own to go after Magus himself. Upon reaching Magus, Tachi made a desperate leap and landed on his starfighter, leaving Amidala to fly the ship herself. Tachi was able to break into Magus’ ship and fight him off, which resulted in the ship's crash landing.</p><p>When the Jedi found them, Fry already had Magus held at gunpoint, while Tachi was fatally injured, having been shot by Magus. Kenobi tried to save her, but she stopped him knowing she was dying, and the two expressed their love for each other yet again. Tachi handed him the blue warming crystal she had from their first mission with Fry, telling Obi-Wan that she would always be with him, and then passed on. As Obi-Wan came close to the dark side, he held his lightsaber blade to Magus' throat; however, he regained control before it was too late, sparing the bounty hunter. Later Skywalker wondered about Kenobi's feelings for Tachi, but incorrectly came to the conclusion that his master did not love Tachi because he did not kill her murderer. Kenobi had learned to love with an open heart, and could live with losing Tachi. The memory of a dedicated Jedi and dear friend lived on with Kenobi and he continued to miss her just as constantly and intently as he went into exile to watch over young Luke Skywalker on Tatooine following the Great Jedi Purge.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Once a feared overlord of his own, Trap Jaw was part of <a href=\"/skeletor/4005-16424/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16424\">Keldor's</a> army, but decided to betray him and build an army of his own. Upon returning to <a href=\"/snake-mountain/4020-51340/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-51340\">Snake Mountain</a> to battle Keldor he was faced not by Keldor, but who he had become, Skeletor.</p><p>The battle was lost and Trap Jaw was defeated by Skeletor. His right arm and jaw were destroyed by Skeletor. Instead of destroying him Skeletor made <a href=\"/tri-klops/4005-48396/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48396\">Tri-Klops</a> rebuild him. He has since served Skeletor but maybe one day Trap Jaw will once again give the orders.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Major Story Arcs</h2><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">He-man and Masters of the Universe (2012)</h3><p><strong>For more information see : <a href=\"/he-man-and-the-masters-of-the-universe/4050-50154/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-50154\">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</a></strong></p><p>Trap Jaw is once again ruler of his own people, a nomad band of Desert riders. They have set up camp in the Arid Spring Oasis, and this is where Adam is brought before Trap Jaw. Instead of killing Adam right away, as Skeletor has commanded, Trap Jaw gives him a chase to earn his freedom by fighting to the death for it. This back fires and Adam escapes, along with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/teela/4005-16427/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16427\">Teela, </a>leaving Trap Jaw to explain to Skeletor why he did not just slit Adam's throat when he had the chance.</p><p>Later when Adam finds the <a href=\"/sword-of-grayskull/4055-55720/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55720\">Power Sword</a> and changes into <a href=\"/he-man/4005-16423/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16423\">He-Man</a>, Trap Jaw can be seen taking his nomads away to avoid He-man's wrath.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Trap Jaw is known for his iron jaw and large mechanical arm. His jaw is lined with razor sharp teeth, giving him a very dangerous bite. His arm is super-humanly strong and durable. The arm can be equipped with a wide array of different weapons. As a feared warlord, Trap Jaw has some knowledge on tactics. He is also very proficient with weapons.</p><p>In the 2002 series he displays the ability to eat metals. It is demonstrated that the more metal he eats the stronger he becomes.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a> <h2>Movie Adaptation</h2> <p>In the 2007 film adaptation of 30 Days of Night, Marlow is played by Danny Huston. While the character's name was Marlow, Huston bore more of a resemblance to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48404\" href=\"/vicente/4005-48404/\" slug=\"vicente\"> Vicente</a> in terms of his role in the film (and possibly appearance) than to the actual character Marlow. In the film, Marlow was an elder of the group, and was in a role of leadership over the other vampires. Vicente did not actually make an appearance in the film, and the final fight scene in the film between Marlow and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47928\" href=\"/eben-olemaun/4005-47928/\" slug=\"eben-olemaun\"> Eben Olemaun</a> was the same fight scene depicted in the comics as being between Eben and Vicente. Marlow died in the same manner as Vicente, while fighting the vampire Eben, Eben punched through Marlow's mouth and through the back of his skull.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b><i>1st. app; Mangazine v.2 #11</i></b></p><p> </p><h2>Family</h2><p>Gina Diggers is the first child of Julia and Theodore Diggers. Gina's mother's family was made up of barbarians and monks while her father's includes many strong mages and a mysteriously powerful grandmother. When Gina was young, her parents adopted a were-cheetah that became Gina's sister, Brittany \"<a href=\"/cheetah/4005-48413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48413\">Cheetah</a>\" Diggers. Gina's grandfather on her father's side was a powerful mage but a horrible accident turned him into the Lich King. Soon after his transformation, he tried to kill Gina's father but ended up transporting her mother to another dimension instead.</p><p>On one of Gina and Cheetah's early adventures, she and Cheetah became subject to a bad-luck curse intended to kill them. To divest themselves of the curse Gina attempted to transfer it to a biological sample containing both her and her sister's DNA. The combination of science and magic created a new life, much to their surprise, Gina's second sister, the half-Brit, half-Gina <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brianna-diggers/4005-48591/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48591\">Brianna Diggers</a>. Though Brianna briefly tried to kill her siblings due to the effects of the curse, once she was freed of it she rapidly became a part of the family.</p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><p>Though her mother was a great fighter, Gina inherited none of her gifts. Likewise, she gained none of her father's aptitude for magic. To give her something, her father turned her to science where she discovered that she was amazingly talented. By the time she was 18 she had received degrees in mathematics, chemistry, biology, engineering, physics and archeology. Her pursuit of knowledge drove her into isolation and she spent her time building gadgets, studying machines and entertaining herself with science fiction and fantasy media.</p><p>The change in her attitude came when her sister grabbed her by the breasts and told her how attractive she was and that she should start looking at men more emotionally. This rough treatment and stern lecture released something in Gina and she became more aggressive, adventurous and boy-crazy. She took up adventuring and archeology and also went after any guy with a pretty face and nice body. To help her find guys even while she's out and about, her standard adventuring outfit is impractically skimpy. Though she was now eager to get into the world, her nerdy lifestyle from before had left her ill equipped to deal with real life and real men, so Cheetah became her protector.</p><p> </p><p>Together they went on a large number of adventures, discovering the cities of Atlantis and El Dorado, both really crashed alien ships, where they encountered Cheetah's future husband <a href=\"/stryypgia/4005-48589/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48589\">Stryyp'Gia</a>, encountered a curse that resulted in the creation of her sister Gina, and fought the evil <a href=\"/the-dynasty-of-the-stars/4060-57220/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57220\">Dynasty of the Stars</a>.</p><p> </p><p>Gina eventually started passing on her knowledge, running an advanced archeology course at a university, the student of which would help her own explorations into the world's vast untapped past.</p><p> </p>",

Shopping, her husband, and tuna. Not necessarily within that order. Normally, Britanny had eaten tuna from a can, but eventually she went out for hunt for real, fresh tuna. In this fishing trip she caught one of the largest tuna ever. It had a large scar over it's eye and was called \"Scar-Face\". Britanny had been a bit too careless around her new catch. The giant fish bit her finger and fell back into the ocean. Much to Britanny's horror.

This ate at her for many months. Even to the point of where it started to haunt her dream.

Luckly, Britanny had brought the harpy Charlotte along.</p><p>Charlotte was able to fly Britanny up to the top of the colossus, but had carried her up in her three hundred pound hybrid form. In Britanny's excitement she had neglected to change her ninety pound human form. Once at the top Charlotte was exhausted to the point where she couldn't even stand. Time was short, because the death ray from outer space was on the way. Even though the colossus would deflect the ray. The force of the contact would be of nuclear proportion.</p><p>Now at the top Britanny saw that Scar-Face was trapped within the pool. There was no need for a fishing pole and there was no time to mess around. Brit changed back into her hybrid form and jumped into the water and released all her months of frustration.

To prepare to deflect the space death ray it was converting oxygen and water into energy .The water that had held Scar-Face was being sucked within and it was creating a vacuum reaction. Britanny was able to run, carrying the tuna; but Charlotte was still too exhausted to move. No matter how hard she struggled. Charlotte fell inside the giant. The gears were moving inside and one of the gears grabbed and crush one of her wings. She cried out for help, but Britanny hesitated. If she let go of the fish she would never get it again. Scar-Face would be destroyed by the coming explosion and her ring would be lost forever. In anger and frustration she tossed the tuna off into the sea and using her super speed saved Charlotte just in time from being crushed completely. Charlotte's wing was in great pain, and Britanny apologized for her hesitation. She had neglected to remember just how tired Charlotte was from carrying her earlier. Trapped inside, Britanny made a run for the outside. With no where to go she made a blind leap. Charlotte tried to fly and carry them both to safety. This time Britanny had remember to change into her human form. Charlotte's injured wing gave out and they were both falling to the sea below. It looked as if they were doomed, but they were caught by the force field on Gina's boat that was controlled by the AI on board. The boat pulled them in and used it's hydro foil mode to go into high speed and escape the blast radius. Britanny was sure her ring was lost forever, but at least they were all safe.</p><p>The sun had set and Britanny had come to terms that she had lost her ring. They decided to celebrate with some chocolate milks, but the computer AI on the boat told them that it had to eject everything that was stored in the boat's cooler. It had to make room for some new cargo. Curious Britanny opened the cooler and to her great surprise saw the giant tuna Scar-Face. The boats AI</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-905415\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 490px\" data-ratio=\"0.86530612244898\" data-width=\"490\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-905415\"><img alt=\"Britanny's Victory\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png 490w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png 480w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Britanny's Victory\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png 490w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png 480w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/905415-golddigger_brit004.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Britanny's Victory</figcaption></figure><p>had seen the fish being tossed off the colossus.

Has the ability to change her appearance. She does have a human form, but keeps her more cat shaped ears. The human for for most werecats are much smaller then their hybrid forms, which is a half way point between their human and complete animal form. Britanny chooses to remain in her hybrid form. With this she can retain super speed and strength she wouldn't have access to in her tiny human form. Her husband Stripe also likes her tall. She can also control the length of her hair at will.</p><p>Her hybrid form is quite muscular, but still very feminine, curvaceous and a large bust. Her skin is covered in a short fur the color of yellow and with with black spots. The whites of her eyes are a light shade of green with green pupils.</p><h3>Body Statistics</h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><thead><tr><th>Stats</th><th>Human Form</th><th>Hybrid Form</th><th>Animal Form</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span><b>Height:</b></span></td><td><span><b>5'5\"</b><i>(165cm)</i></span></td><td><span><b>7'</b><i>(213cm)</i></span></td><td><span><b>8'6\"</b><i>(260cm)length</i></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><b>Weight:</b></span></td><td><span><b>118lbs</b><i>(54kg)</i></span></td><td><span><b>308lbs</b><i>(140kg)</i></span></td><td><span><b>360lbs</b><i>(163kg)</i></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><b>Measurements:</b></span></td><td><span><b>29-24-28 in.</b> <i>(74-61-71 cm)</i></span></td><td><span><b>57-30-49</b> <b>in.</b> <i>(145-76-124 cm)</i></span></td><td><span><b>n/a</b></span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Britanny's Powers</h2><h3>Werecat Powers</h3><p>As a member of the werecat species of demihumans. These powers bring size, strength, and increased senses. Britanny has three forms of transformation. There is the basic human form, animal form, and hybrid form, which is a mid way level between man and animal. This gives the demihuman the advantages between the two levels. Once a werecat transforms out of their hybrid form to their human form they can't return to the hybrid form for twenty-four hours. Though with training a werecat can change at any time.</p><p>Britanny received her transformation training from a former enemy turned friend, <a href=\"../../jetta/29-48857/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jetta</a> the werewolf. Through training she also learned to control the length of her hair at will.</p><h3>Gaoblin Magic</h3><p>Shortly after the birth of Tiffany, Britanny was stranded in the pocket dimension of Oblivion, home of the Gaoblin. There, their leader and high priestess, Crescens, who installed Gaoblin ether vent symbionts in her shoulders, what appears to be 'holes' that gather magic and overcome a werecreature's natural disadvantage in the area as a reward for Britanny restarting the cycle of death and rebirth in Oblivion, and taught Cheetah her knowledge of magic for several years. Now, Cheetah possesses great spell ability, which she most commonly uses in the form of 'lightning aura,' a form that both greatly increases her senses, and boosts her speed and strength to even greater heights. Cheetah did not neglect the more traditional spellcasting aspects of Crescens magic either, and now, like Crescens and her father, she may be counted as an archmage.</p><h2>Other Media</h2>",

    "deck": "Dev is one of Theo's \"moral guides\".",
    "description": "<p>Dev is from Perspectra, more specifically Nefario.  Dev's job, and the job of everyone from Perspectra, is to guide the life of their host human.  Theo in Dev's case.  In all effects Dev could be considered Theo's \"shoulder devil\", and Ange would be his counter \"shoulder angel\".  As Theo is born, and Ange and Dev go to join him, Dev proudly annouces to baby Theo \"You're in for the ride of your life\"...... which is far more accurate then Dev ever could have imagined.<br /></p><p>Dev doesn't exactly meet the stereotypical definition of a shoulder devil, since he often does concede to Ange's suggestions, because he knows that they are in Theo's best interest.  Dev pushes Theo to \"be a man!\", which may not always turn out for the best, but Dev won't let Theo be a wimp; which is a challenge since Theo is one of the \"smart kids\".</p><p>While Theo and Kiori's  biology class is working on dissecting frogs Walker starts a Frog Fight and  the What If Mafia barge in and tramble over both Dev and Ange.  The What if Mafia starts giving Theo Ideas of a bunch of different frog scenarios and Theo, since both Ange and Dev have become over-run, starts acting on them.  Luckily Dev is able to fight is way back and get Theo to settle down so he can kick the What If Mafia off his shoulders.<br /></p><p>Ange and Dev often argue over what they should be guiding Theo to do, which gets rather bothersome for Theo, since he kind thinks he might be going nuts!  Eventually Theo learns to just tell them to \"Shut Up!\" when they get over-bearing in their arguing.</p><p>Later that day Theo notices Walker terrorizing a kid, so Theo goes over to confront him.  Theo rips into Walker for venting his insecurities by intimidating small kids.  Walker lashes back with a comment about Theo's family needing Shrinks.  When Theo hears this he gets angry and Dev basically manifests in Theo, making him get/look angrier then he ever has before.  this scares Walker off for the time being, but Ange gets on Dev's case about how he should have manifested in Theo, which neither of them are suppose to do!</p><p>During one of Theo's sessions with his Shrink, there's fire alarm and both Dev and Ange are shocked to see</p><p>When Kiori draws a symbol on Theo's skateboard and hands it back to Theo, Dev is somehow brought into reality, so both Theo and Kiori and see him.  Dev is shoved into the closet when Kiori's father knocks on the door wondering what all the noise was from.  After placate her fatehr with a lie about Theo trying a skateboard trick in the house and breaking his board, they bring Dev back out of the closet, to which he comments \"Get me out of here! Monsters and closets just do not---\" then Kiori cuts him off asking what he is.  Kiori and Theo try to sneak him back to Theo's house so they can hide him until the figure out what is going on and a way to get Dev back into Theo's head.  On the way back to Theo's home, Dev is mistaken for being the mascot of Theo's school and gets taken to a pep rally, where Theo has to remind him not to talk so much since, until a real mascot, his mouth moves when he talks.  After the Pep rally, Dev berates Theo for acting like such a wimp, since Ange is the only one \"in his head\" to guide him, and proceeds to throw Theo in a sprinkler.  Dev takes off with a bunch of Theo's classmates.</p><p>While Dev is off enjoying himself, he runs into Walker and is about to fight him when Thom comes in to break it up.  Dev then dashes off to the beach, challenging them to catch him if they can.  Once Theo, Thom, and Kiori  catch up with Dev, Dev and Theo (with Ange still in his head) stand and argue for a long time.  Kiori paces around the group of people and then suddenly there's a flash of light...........they're all taken to Persectra.</p><p>Dev wants to figure out what's going on so he goes to see Ember.  Ember informs Dev that she knows who he is and why he is there.  She knows of Theo and his friends being in Nefario and she's already \"taking car of it\".  Then she lets one of the thugs \"explain\"</p>",

    "description": "<p>As Ange prepares for her journey to begin as the moral guide, giver of proper advice and constructor of a firm foundation, for her selected host, she fidgets and worries asking repeatedly what her mother had done on the day she went to join her selected host.  Marina proudly encourages her that her mother had been just as nervous as she was being.  When she first meets Dev, her Nefarian counter-part, she is appalled by his rude egotism.<br /></p><p>Ange usually guides Theo away from \"dangerous\" things that could injure or embarrass him, such as tricks on his skateboard to impress women.  She is also firm in her beliefs about guiding Theo in doing well in school.  Ange and Dev often argue over what they should be guiding Theo to do, which gets rather bothersome for Theo, since he kind thinks he might be going nuts!  Eventually Theo learns to just tell them to \"Shut Up!\" when they get over-bearing in their arguing.</p><p>During the Track meet Dev convinces Theo to take a short-cut to try to win the race.  Despite Ange's berating Dev for manifesting in Theo when Walker insulted his family, Ange manifests in Theo when he trips on a rock and goes flying over a steep drop.  She literally make him FLY.  Neither Ange nor Dev knew it was possible to actually APPLY themselves into Theo's world.</p><p>After Dev is, somehow, pulled out of Theo's head, Ange is the only one left in his head to guide him.  Ange's influence is immediately noticeable when he start apologizing for bumping into people and the slicks his hair.</p><p>Dev ends up taking off and so Ange has free reign in influencing how Theo acts.  Later Theo Thom, and Kiori catch up with Dev at the beach.  Theo/Ange and Dev argue for a while, during which time Kiori is pacing around the group.  Suddenly there's flash of light and everyone is transported to Perspectra.  Ange immediately goes to hunt down Marina to try to figure out what is going on.  When she finds Marina, she's informed that there's FAR more then she realizes to the situation.</p>",

She left Elysia to join the Nefarian's, where she is now working as their leader.  Having once been an Elysian, some of the inhabitants don't trust her.  They fear that she may have doubts as to who her commitment is to, but \"she is hot\"!</p><p>Ember is rather certain that the balance of power between the Nefarian's and Elysian's is straining and plans to put herself in position to pick up the pieces  WHEN it does.  She is using the What If Mafia to gather information, along with otehr things, to help ensure that she can do this.</p><p>Ember has also gained nearly unanimous support from the Elysian's as their new Administrative leader.  Ember has gained an item that had been banished over 2 cycles prior to the current day, and there are a few of the Elysians that are worried about the ramifications of her having it.  And what she \"could\" do with it.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Yog-Sothoth is an Outer God in the stories of H.P. Lovecraft and other authors. Yog-Sothoth is linked with all of time and space, but is sealed outside of the universe that humans inhabit. In <i>Through the Gates of the Silver Key</i>, Yog-Sothoth is described as an All-in-One and One-in-All of limitless being and self, allied to the essence of existence. </p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>According to the stories <em>The Horror in the Museum</em> and <em>The Lurker at the Threshold</em>, Yog-Sothoth appears in this dimension as a congeries of iridescent globes \"stupendous in its malign suggestiveness\", from which it extrudes tentacles, eyes, mouths or whatever the need of the moment requires. In Lovecraft's 1928 story <em>The Dunwich Horror, </em>its spawn appear as an invisible mass of feelers, legs, eyes, stalked organs, and tentacles, made visible only for a second by the use of a magic powder.  Kenneth Grant, an occultist who appears to take all this a lot more seriously than is good for him, says Yog-Sothoth is a manifestation of the darkest part of the psyche. Grant describes it as a gangrenous shade of green. with no upper skull at all, only a bloated mass that is its maggot-festering, naked brain, a madly gazing, giant's \"Cyclops\" eye ringed by octopoid palpi and shark teeth above a warty tyrannosaurus-like body covered in muck.</p><h2>Yog-Sothoth's Avatars</h2><p>Yog-Sothoth has avatars who live to serve the great deity.</p><p> </p><p><b>Aforgomon: </b></p><p>Aforgomon was worshiped as the God of Time by many cultures due to its power to manipulate time and space. He is usually shrouded in a mysterious, blinding light and only shows himself to those who anger him.</p><p> </p><p><b>Umr at-Tawil (Most Ancient and Prolonged of Life): </b></p><p>Mentioned in</p><p><i>Through the Gates of the Silver Key</i></p><p>, he looks over the halls beyond the Gate of the Silver Key and the Ancient Ones within. He looks like a man underneath a shimmering veil. Fortunately for humans, he does not drive insane those who look upon him.</p><h2>Books of Worship</h2><p>The Necronomicon, Unausprechichen Kulten, Pnakotic Manuscripts, Azathoth and Others, Seven Cryptic Books of Hsan, Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre by H.P. Lovecraft. Liber Al. H.P. Lovecraft and the Hidden God by Kenneth Grant.</p><h2>Doctor Who</h2><p>Yog-Sothoth appears as a recurring villain in the Doctor who franchise known as \"The Great Intelligence\" in both the classic and revived shows that appeared in the episodes \"The Abominable Snowmen\" &amp; \"The Web of Fear\" of the classic show and \"The Snowmen\", \"The Bells of Saint John\" &amp; \"The Name of the Doctor\" of the revived show and was the main antagonist of series 7.</p><p>He also appeared in the direct-to-video spin-off episode \"Downtime\" and in the novels \"Millennial Rites\" &amp; \"All-Consuming Fire\" as well as the video game \"Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctors\".</p><p>This version of Yog-Sothoth was a being of the Pre-Universe and after that universe was destroyed he became a being without a physical body and became known as \"The Great Intelligence\".</p><p>In the classic show and in \"Downtime\" he used robotic Yeti as his soldiers and in the revived show he used used living Snowmen in the 2012 Christmas special \"The Snowmen\", robots called \"Spoonheads\" in \"The Bells of Saint John\" and strange creatures called \"The Whisper Men\" in \"The Name of the Doctor\".</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/146053/3240809-web_above_new_world_university.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3240809\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75708502024292\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/146053/3240809-web_above_new_world_university.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3240809\"><img alt=\"The Great Intelligence's web as seen in the direct-to-video spin-off episode \"Downtime\".\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/146053/3240809-web_above_new_world_university.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/146053/3240809-web_above_new_world_university.jpg 741w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/146053/3240809-web_above_new_world_university.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Great Intelligence's web as seen in the direct-to-video spin-off episode \"Downtime\".</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/146053/3240810-greatintelliface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3240810\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.57428571428571\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/146053/3240810-greatintelliface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3240810\"><img alt=\"Richard E Grant as the Great Intelligence.\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/146053/3240810-greatintelliface.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/146053/3240810-greatintelliface.jpg 700w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/146053/3240810-greatintelliface.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Richard E Grant as the Great Intelligence.</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The god is omniscient and all-seeing and gaining favor with the entity can give one incredible and vast knowledge.

    "deck": "Dane is a vampire who was created by, and followed Marlow.",
    "description": "<p>Dane was a follower of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48402\" href=\"/marlow-roderick/4005-48402/\" slug=\"marlow-roderick\">Marlow Roderick</a>.  Marlow created Dane, as well as others, so Dane held respect for Marlow.  After Marlow's death in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-48407\" href=\"/barrow/4020-48407/\" slug=\"barrow\">Barrow</a>, Alaska, Dane learned of the novel that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47982\" href=\"/stella-olemaun/4005-47982/\" slug=\"stella-olemaun\">Stella Olemaun</a> wrote about the ordeal.  Along with many other vampires, enraged not only at the deaths of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48404\" href=\"/vicente/4005-48404/\" slug=\"vicente\">Vicente</a> and Marlow, but at the human woman who sought to out their kind, Marlow stalked Stella to a stop on her book tour to talk at a college in California.  Dane was present during the lecture, and attempted to attack her during the ensuing violence.  Stella fought back and Dane escaped with little injury when the police arrived at the scene.</p> <p>Dane would continue stalking Stella until he came face to face with Stella and Judith Ali.  Stella was aware of their stalker, and left the safety of her entourage to confront him.  She called him out, and he appeared before them.  Prepared for fighting the un-dead like few others, Stella caught Dane off guard, and struck him.  During the fight she threw a small explosive device, which he caught, and Dane's hand was blown off.  With a handgun trained on his head Stella questioned Dane.  Dane was forthcoming about his reasons for attacking her.  The vampire elders had led them to believe that it was Stella who killed Marlow, rather than Vicente.  When Stella told him what had actually happened, he offered information on how to bring her hur husband back to life, along with her husband's remains that an accomplice, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48430\" href=\"/yuki/4005-48430/\" slug=\"yuki\">Yuki</a>, had stolen from his grave.  Stella agreed despite Judith's protests and Dane left.</p><p>Yuki and Dane had planned to use the remains of Stella's late husband, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47928\" href=\"/eben-olemaun/4005-47928/\" slug=\"eben-olemaun\">Eben Olemaun</a>, to bring him back to life, so that they could kill him again in front of Stella to exact revenge for Marlow's death.  Yuki was stopped by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48406\" href=\"/lilith/4005-48406/\" slug=\"lilith\">Lilith</a>, Vicente's widow, and was slain for interfering with Lilith's revenge.</p><p>Dane would again locate Stella when he had more information about who was really after Stella.  Stella's bodyguards left her for joining Dane, and she went with Dane to get some rest.  When Stella awoke she and Dane began to talk, and when she made an off hand remark Dane made an advance.  Accepting, Stella slept with Dane while the last of Stella's men stood guard outside.  Dane and Stella found their guard killed with a message of where Stella could find Lilith.  Dane was referred to as a traitor, and was told he was not welcome.</p> <p>When Dane and Stella entered the cemetery, Lilith reanimated the local corpses and had them attack Dane and Stella for Dane's coming.  They were easy to dispatch, and Dane and Stella were surrounded, and led to an abandoned house deep in the woods.  There they found Lilith and a hoard of lesser vampires.</p><p>Lilith had Dane removed while she and Stella bartered for Eben's remains and the proof of vampire existence which Stella possessed.  When Stella emerged again from the house surprised to see Dane still alive, he told her that his capturers were amateurs, and that he easily snapped their necks.  Dane wanted Stella to stay with him, but knowing that there was even a chance that she could be with her husband again she told him that she had to try.  As he walked off Dane told Stella that he believed he was falling in love with her.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Powers</h2><p>Dane is an experienced vampire, and comfortable with his own abilities.  Like many other vampires, Dane exhibits strength, speed, agility, and senses which are enhanced beyond that of a normal human.  He is quick enough that  he can maneuver at close range faster than a normal human can track.  He also exhibits the fangs and claws that other vampires have.  He is a skilled unarmed fighter, and has killed groups of other vampires that have attacked him.  Even with the loss of his right hand Dane is dangerous, and is not to be taken lightly.</p><p>Despite his vampirism, Dane is in complete control of his need to feed, and seems to present no danger to humans that he likes.</p>",

    "deck": "An evolved human who experienced tragedy in her youth, joined the Israeli Army, and was recruited by Mr. Bennet's organization, she has an amazing ability to interpret electronic, digital, and radio transmissions",
    "description": "<p>In 1989, Hana survives a suicide attack when her bus crashes off a cliff. She is hospitalized for at least six months, and misses the funerals of her mother and grandmother. After recovering in 1990, she vows to live up to her family's legacy. In 1997, Hana attempts to enlist in the Israeli Army as a paratrooper. Despite her skills, her request is denied by the IDF enlisting officer because of \"grave concerns about [her] heart\". Because her \"judgment cannot be trusted\", she takes an intelligence position with the Mossad, in which she analyzes, plans attacks, and plots strategies. She seems to know the moves of her enemies before they do. Hana is promoted, but remains unhappy; she continues to work to prove her worthiness. One night while walking the perimeter, she is overtaken by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47669\" href=\"/hrg/4005-47669/\" slug=\"hrg\">Mr. Bennet</a>, who assures her that he is there to change her life.</p><p>Three years after her hospitalization, Hana is sent by her father to a Tel Aviv psychologist to overcome her abandonment issues. In the present, Mr. Bennet asks Hana to trust him. She tries her best to do so, despite her misgivings about trusting people since her mother's and grandmother's deaths. Telling her he works for the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55745\" href=\"/cia/4060-55745/\" slug=\"cia\">CIA</a>, he takes her to a secret facility in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55827\" href=\"/alaska/4020-55827/\" slug=\"alaska\">Alaska</a>, where she begins to train physically as she continues to be evaluated medically. She grows frustrated with the lack of progress, but is suddenly able to perceive a text message sent to Mr. Bennet by a person named \"Thompson\". Suddenly, she is overwhelmed by emails, text messages, and satellite transmissions which she is able to perceive out of thin air, and Mr. Bennet knocks her unconscious.</p><p>When Hana wakes up several weeks later, she is unable to speak due to her long convalescence, but is able to communicate with Mr. Bennet and his organization by sending messages directly from her mind to cell phones. Mr. Bennet tells her she's ready for her first mission.</p><p>Hana embarks on her first mission: acquire computer data from a microbiology lab in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55953\" href=\"/tanzania/4020-55953/\" slug=\"tanzania\">Tanzania</a>. Hana secretly monitors the wireless communications of a man named Dr. Henry Strauss, a microbiologist who has created a powerful biological weapon—an alteration to bacterial DNA that renders ordinary stomach microbes deadly. Hana maintains direct contact with Mr. Bennet via her powers, and transmits the material to the laptop in the Bennets' home in Odessa, TX. Hana runs into trouble with the doctor's henchmen, but escapes using her combat skills and remembering the legacy of her grandmother's capture during World War II. Outside the jail, she only finds more armed soldiers.</p><p>Hana reveals her CIA connection, and is brought to the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania. There, she talks with an Embassy employee, who informs her that there is no Alaskan facility, and that all the numbers she has given them are disconnected. Hana remembers her family's legacy, and wonders where she went wrong. She begins to discover her identity, and decides to fight. Hana manipulates the sprinklers to create a diversion, then grabs the employee. Holding him hostage, and grabbing a guard's gun, Hana escapes through a window of the Embassy. She feels \"alive for the first time\".</p><p>Hana finds her sanctuary in remote Missoula, MT, where she adopts the name \"Samantha\". In the secluded state, she enjoys the fresh air and senses wireless transmissions more clearly. She spends her time gathering intelligence on Mr. Bennet and his organization. She comes across an email from one \"TEDDYBEAR616\", who seems likewise bent on exacting revenge on Mr. Bennet. Hana hastily leaves <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55760\" href=\"/montana/4020-55760/\" slug=\"montana\">Montana</a>, and heads south to meet this potential ally.In his hideout in the Nevada desert, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47761\" href=\"/ted-sprague/4005-47761/\" slug=\"ted-sprague\">Ted Sprague</a> receives an instant message from a user named \"Wireless\", even though he's not connected to the Internet. Hana arrives and explains her abilities. She shows Ted the mark on her neck and shows him the schematics for the needle which created it, telling him he can use his connections as a medical equipment salesman to track down their abductor. Just then, Hana perceives communications indicating Ted is in danger, and leaves him.</p><p>As the three meet by Karen Sprague's grave, Hana believes that Matt and Ted are disillusioned by anger and revenge. Hana heads off on her motorcycle, following a trail of intercepted wireless communications. She is detoured by a girl being taken advantage of by a child pornographer at a casino. Hana sends the girl home, beats up the man, and issues a threat to all watching the wireless feed. Though she loses the email trail she was originally following, she is satisfied with her righteous deeds. Hana, traveling Route 66 on her motorcycle, intercepts a message from Mr. Bennet asking for her help. She IMs him at an Odessa coffee shop, confirming that she'll help him out, despite their history.</p><p>Hana sits in a loft and reviews a message from Mr. Bennet, but is limited in her abilities to retrieve the needed file. She makes her way to a bar in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55685\" href=\"/washington-dc/4020-55685/\" slug=\"washington-dc\">Washington, DC</a>, in order to meet with Casey Smith. She seduces him, sleeps with him, and steals his ID before leaving his apartment. Hana then uses Casey's car and ID to get past <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55834\" href=\"/the-pentagon/4020-55834/\" slug=\"the-pentagon\">Pentagon</a> security. She makes her way to an archival room, where she finds a file. Hana reads the Lonestar File and finds out about miraculous events that took place during the Vietnam War, While continuing to read Dallas's account of Operation: Lone Star, Hana asks herself who were these men and what do they have to do with taking down The Company? While continuing to read Dallas's account of Operation: Lone Star, Hana contemplates Austin's intentions and learns the truth about Au Co. Hana finishes reading the Lonestar File to discover the identities of Austin and Dallas. After reading the Lonestar File and learning who <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48433\" href=\"/mr-linderman/4005-48433/\" slug=\"mr-linderman\">Linderman</a> is, Hana heads out of the Pentagon. She stops when she detects a flurry of security activity, but is able to avoid being captured when she sends a message to the security dispatcher posing as CaseyZ. Hana goes to the airport, buys a plane ticket on Linderman's dime, and hacks into the Linderman Group's server. She then learns of his plan to rig <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47677\" href=\"/nathan-petrelli/4005-47677/\" slug=\"nathan-petrelli\">Nathan Petrelli's</a> election. She sends a call-to-arms message to all those who frequent her website.</p><p>Hana meets up with Mr. Bennet, Ted, and Matt in a playground somewhere between Texas and New York. She draws her guns on the men, suspicious of their motives—she remembers her time in Alaska when she had an equally difficult time trusting Mr. Bennet. When Bennet pleads with her to destroy a satellite that will take out a tracking system, Hana backs down and agrees to the plan. Hana goes to New York City to celebrate an \"end of the world party\" at a nightclub. After kissing a patron, she notes that she has never felt so alive. Soon thereafter, Hana tries unsuccessfully to hack past the security for the satellite. She leaves for <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55799\" href=\"/hong-kong/4020-55799/\" slug=\"hong-kong\">Hong Kong</a> where she plans to hitch a ride aboard a rocket, but is stopped at the launch site by Chinese soldiers. Flashing back to two weeks after her mother and grandmother died, Hana recounts attempting to fly off her roof using an umbrella to slow herself down. Drawing on this memory, she attacks the five soldiers and takes them hostage. Meanwhile, she has sent a series of forged emails that convince the Chinese government that she is a an engineer and a member of the rocket crew, so the Chinese official helps her and reprimands the soldiers. They fly into orbit and \"Dr. Gitelman\" heads out for a space walk near the satellite. Hana attempts to tell the satellite to self-destruct by falling into the atmosphere, but it has a defense mechanism that infects her with a computer virus. She realizes she is \"dying... but I'm not dead\" and jumps to the satellite to force it down, burning up on re-entry. Two days later, though presumably physically dead, Hana chats online to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47675\" href=\"/micah-sanders/4005-47675/\" slug=\"micah-sanders\">Micah</a> who is worrying about his father's fate after being shot. She tells him that \"the truth is, death is never quite what you expect it to be. It might seem like an ending but really... the journey is just beginning.\"</p><p>Hana puts out a call for help. She messages Traveler and asks him to deliver a message to Richard Drucker in Bhutan. Traveler asks if there's any chance Hana rendezvousing with him, but she tells him she's not the same girl he once knew. She then faxes the intended message to Traveler in Goa. Showing up on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59158\" href=\"/matt-neuenberg/4005-59158/\" slug=\"matt-neuenberg\">Matt Neuenberg's</a> Company computer screen as a file named K. Apila, Hana is informed by Drucker they're in the Company's mainframe as \"Purushas,\" or bodiless individuals, to pull a massive viral file from Drucker's hard drive to completely destroy the Company's entire mainframe.Inside the Company's mainframe, Hana tries to escape the collapsing datastream with Drucker. They reach a dead end, and soon accept their fates; Hana tells Drucker they will meet again as they are seemingly deleted along with the rest of the mainframe's information.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Sarah Ellis was a young girl who lived with her step-mother after her dad left. Her step-mother was very controlling of her, making her do all the work around the house. She discovered her power when she finally stood up to her step-mom, where she shouted at her telling her to just die, and instantly, her step-mother's heart stopped beating. After that, Sarah went around doing whatever she wanted, using her power. Then the Company found out about her. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47667\" href=\"/haitian/4005-47667/\" slug=\"haitian\">The Haitian</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47669\" href=\"/hrg/4005-47669/\" slug=\"hrg\">Noah Bennet</a> found her and tried to convince her to join the Company to find heroes. She, at first, refused and tried to use her persuasion. But, the Haitian had neutralized her powers. So, she decided to join the Company and dawn the alias Eden McCain.</p><p>Since joining, she had persuaded <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47670\" href=\"/isaac-mendez/4005-47670/\" slug=\"isaac-mendez\">Isaac</a> the painter to tell the future, and she had worked alongside <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47676\" href=\"/mohinder-suresh/4005-47676/\" slug=\"mohinder-suresh\">Mohinder</a> to find more heroes. When the company caught <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47679\" href=\"/sylar/4005-47679/\" slug=\"sylar\">Sylar</a>, a powerful villain who steals powers, Eden decided to take matters into her own hands. She wanted Sylar dead, but no one else wanted him gone yet. He was being held in a secret prison in the Primach facility.Eden decided to go to Syalr's prison and use her powers. She had a gun. She told him normally that she was going to give him the gun, and he was going to kill himself. Sylar used his telekinesis to throw Eden through the glass of his cell. Eden shot herself in the head to stop Sylar from gaining her power.</p><p>When Mr. Bennet told her drunk of a father that Eden was dead, her father didn't care, even after Mr. Bennet forced him against a wall and told him she was a hero. Mr. Bennet had the Haitian wipe her father's memories, telling him to just leave the guilt.</p><p>She recently appeared in a back story of Elle's where she displayed hand-to-hand combat skill.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Sarah Ellis, later Eden McCain, has the power of persuasion, which she directs through her voice. She normally has to repeat the command a few times, before the person actually falls into the trance in which they do what she wants them to do. When they wake up from the trance, they usually are unable to remember what happened. For some reason, her ability didn't work on Sylar.</p>",

    "description": "<p>When Linderman was a teenager, he was in the vietnam war, he was a loner who liked to read books, while him and his war buddies were going to a Vietnamese base, they were ambushed and were being shot at. At the end of the shooting, only Arthur Petrelli and Linderman survived but it was revealed that Arthur Petrelli was shot, Linderman went to him and put his hands over the wound and when Linderman took his hands away, the wound on Arthur Petrelli was healed and disappeared. Linderman then remembers the last night he spent with his family, his mother was dying and Linderman learnt to use his power and healed her, after that, his parents were afraid of him and Linderman ran away from home.<br/><br/>Back at the vietnam war, Arthur Petrelli wanted to continue with the mission and the mission was to destroy a peaceful village called Au Co, at first Linderman didn't want to carry out the mission but Arthur Petrelli finally persuaded him to join him and destroy the village. Linderman and Petrelli were getting ready to destroy the village and they rig up explosives everywhere in the village, when the explosives went off, Linderman and Petrelli runs out to carry on with their mission. They then notice that Au Co was not the village but was in fact a little girl with a special ability. Petrelli shoots at her and Linderman tries to stop him shooting her but he was too late, she was already shot. Petrelli stops Linderman from going near her so that he couldn't heal her. Au Co dies and after they completed their mission, they both get a medal of valor for completeing their mission. Austin then refuses to tell people how he was able to heal Petrelli, they then parted and went their seperate ways. Later, Linderman went to Central park and met with Petrelli and says that he understands that he needs to sacrifice for the greater good. Petrelli then said that they will archieve great things together.<br/><br/>Linderman then founded a company named \"The Linderman Group\", his company ran hotels and casinos to cover all the illegal things the Company were doing. He rigged the election so that Nathan Petrelli could win and become a congressman, he also used Niki and Micah so that Nathan could win the election. Linderman was finally killed by DL after he shot him.</p>",

    "deck": "Ace is a world class fighter pilot who owns his own business as transport to anywhere for the right price.",
    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kevin Koss has followed in the footsteps of two generations of extraordinarily talented pilots and has been in a plane almost since he could walk. He's most comfortable in properly equipped fighters, but if it flies, not only can he pilot it, he can make it do things no other pilot can.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">His past is unexplained, but he is shown to be a better than passing street fighter, proficient in various small arms up to a portable rocket launcher, and well-known enough in the aeronautical industry to garner immediate respect and a free hand whenever he involves himself in situations which only someone with his skillset could resolve.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ace met <a href=\"/gina-diggers/4005-48412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48412\"> Gina Diggers</a> and <a href=\"/cheetah/4005-48413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48413\"> Cheetah</a> when they stowed away on one of his flights when they couldn't pay for transportation. He found them by accident and decided to continue to take them where they wanted to go. As a show of gratitude, the two adventurers split the treasure they found upon reaching their destination. Ace and the Diggers have been great friends ever since.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Despite his friendship with Gina, Kevin started going out with her then-arch rival <a href=\"/penny-pincer/4005-48590/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48590\">Penny Pincer</a>. He had started seeing her shortly after Gina and Penny first teamed up. What has occurred since then is a serious relationship between the two with Penny working toward getting married, and Kevin getting used to the idea while sidestepping her less than subtle attempts. She has worn him down to the point where he rarely corrects her anymore when she calls him Kevin in public.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They had some issues caused in part when another woman set her sights on Kevin, <a href=\"/skipper-von-richthofen/4005-67739/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67739\">\"Skippy\"</a> the Premier ace of the mercenary organization <a href=\"/night-flight/4060-57281/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57281\">Night Flight</a>. Skippy has more in common with Ace in regards to flying than Penny does, and believed this made her the better choice for him. Penny feared that she would lose Kevin to her and this is where the issue came from. The situation came to a head when Skippy forced Ace to give his word to marry her by threatening to kill hostages after a failed attempt to take over Night Flight's flying fortress the Gull Wing. Penny Pincher then challenged Skippy to an dog fight for Kevin Koss. Whomever lost would \"ditch\" Kevin and move on. Skippy accepted and it would have been an easy win for her except she had to break off to defend the Gull Wing. It cost her both her plane and the match against Penny, who got a free pass from Night Flight for assisting in the rescue of the Gull Wing. Skippy is leaving Ace to Penny in the mixed belief that Penny does love Ace but she can just be patient that Penny's dangerous lifestyle will end with her being killed leaving Ace to Skippy. </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kevin was conflicted mostly in part because Skippy has been shown to be extremely devious in her plans to get Kevin alone just to give notice that she loves him. She almost worships the skies he flies through and has shown him that she can fly fighter craft AT LEAST as well as he can. On his deciding to and finally getting married to Penny Pincer these feelings have apparently been resolved. Currently as of this writing Penny finally convinced Kevin to propose, and the two have married and are on a \"working\" honeymoon.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">To date - Kevin Koss has flown everything from workbee-type shuttles to FTL-drive starships with rotor-craft and transforming fighter jets in between. He is hideously rich and supports a stable of tens of aircraft with his buying more as he has time for.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Akbar was born in <a href=\"/mecca/4020-57894/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57894\">Mecca</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/saudi-arabia/4020-55952/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55952\">Saudi Arabia</a>. He grew up and rose through the ranks of the Saudi government, amassing a fortune though negotiations of unregulated arms deals. While brilliant when it comes to strategy, Akbar's ego, as well as his lusts, have often been his downfall. He will use tactics, technology, and overwhelming firepower to overcome his foes.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Curse of Tyranthrax</h3><p>General Akbar's first encounter with the Diggers Sisters was in the deserts of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/iran/4020-55903/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55903\">Iran</a> at the tomb of Tyranthrax, the world's first ruler. The General was in the middle of an arms deal when <a href=\"/gina-diggers/4005-48412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48412\">Gina </a>and <a href=\"/cheetah/4005-48413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48413\">Britanny </a>came along. Though at the time he was unaware of their presence, since they were hiding on a cliff above. They were quickly spotted when Gina let out a powerful sneeze. All of Akbar's forces chased after Gina and Britanny with all the weapons and vehicles they had amassed. Even before they knew who they were. During the chase, Akbar recognized Gina Diggers from CNN news broadcasts. Thinking this American blond had just come to raid the 'homeland' only increased his fury to capture her. Gina attempted to lose the mercenaries at her heels by kicking up a dust cloud with her Gina-mobile MK VI. The object wasn't to outrun Akbar's men, but to allow the girls to jump out and let the Gina-mobile lead them away via remote. Thinking the plan had worked, Britanny busted open the entrance to the tomb. Unknown to them was that Akbar had predicted the girl's trick and followed suit. Knowing that Gina Diggers wouldn't of come all this way for nothing, he planned to wait outside of the tomb for Gina to appear and then steal her gains as she tried to leave.</p><p>While inside the tomb, Gina and Britanny were tainted by a Bad Luck curse, made a new friend, <a href=\"/genn/4005-48598/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48598\">Genn</a>; and battled with the powerful monster <a href=\"/daemon-mouse/4005-64683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64683\">Daemon Mouse</a>.</p><p>The girls barely escaped with their lives, only to run into Akbar and his men. Britanny was able to easily escape with her tremendous werecheetah speed. They couldn't get far when the men that continued to chase the Gina-mobile had returned and commandeered Gina's car. Before Britanny could try and run her shorts had fallen down her legs, due to the Bad Luck curse. With the girls caught they were almost subjected to the lustful desires of these terrorists if it had not for the shape-shifting Genn distracting the pervs by changing into an even more buxom woman. Before they could grasp Genn, she levitated out of the way and into the Gina-mobile to escape with the Diggers sisters.</p>",

    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dr. Peachbody is one of Gina Diggers' worst enemies, a talking black Labrador Retriever scientist from an alternate future Earth where dogs evolved genius-level intelligence and took over the world as the dominant species from humans. He discovered how to travel through time using the extra-dimensional realm of chrono-space. Along with his pet attack boy <a href=\"/benji/4005-9919/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9919\">Benji</a>, he traveled through time making changes to ensure his version of Earth came to reality.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In his reality, human rebels had started fighting back using stolen technology. The dogs kept the humans in check through the use of gene-cloned bioweapons, genetic constructs designed to look like monsters of human legend. However, the humans rediscovered the dog whistle, which allowed them to break the dogs' mental control over their bioweapons. Dr. Peachbody set out through time to eliminate the human inventor of the dog whistle. It was while on this mission that he first encountered <a href=\"/gina-diggers/4005-48412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48412\">Gina</a>, <a href=\"/penny-pincer/4005-48590/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48590\">Penny</a>, <a href=\"/ace/4005-48435/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48435\">Ace</a>, and <a href=\"/ryan-tabbot/4005-48602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48602\">Ryan</a> who learned his history and stopped him and Benji. As a result of this interference, Peachbody tried to eliminate the Diggers sisters by sterilizing their parents in the past which the sisters managed to prevent</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Time Warp crossover story-arc</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Peachbody was determined to prevent the Diggers sisters from meddling in his plans and so created a time warp which got the attention of the time-travelers <a href=\"/mita-celande/4005-110282/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-110282\">Mita Celande</a> and her cyborg assistant May from the city of Quagmire (<em>main setting for Ben Dunn's Ninja High School</em>). After tricking Mita and May into attacking the Diggers sisters and trashing Gina's lab, he used Mita's time machine to travel to pre-Ice Age Egypt to take control of technology hidden in the Sphinx. He used this technology to scatter the Gina's group, Mita, May, and several friends of both throughout time. After all the heroes managed to regroup, Mita traveled to Peachbody's time and discovered his earliest known ancestor Pickles. She then traveled to Pickles era with the intention of having him neutered. Peachbody managed to stop this but was tricked into turning off the time warp which was threatening everyone. As a desperate final move, Peachbody fused his body with that of his attack boy Benji with Peachbody's mind in control. In the ensuing fight \"Peachbenji\" was forced to retreat, but Gina had rigged his time-craft to explode which sent him 500 million years into the past where they were trapped.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Peachbody tried to use his combined body's chi abilities to pull the remains of his time-craft from chrono-space, but instead pulled in the boneless body of Gina's first enemy <a href=\"/dreadwing/4005-8992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8992\">Dreadwing</a> which had been separated from his skeleton when Gina rigged the Time-Raft to explode. Intrigued by the powerful body, Peachbody performed another fusion becoming the current \"Dreadbody\" with his mind still dominant.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Once united, Peachbody and Dreadwing set about a staggering plan to get revenge on their common enemy which involved creating a model of all space-time called \"Negative Infinity\". Over time, Dreadwing slowly consumed Peachbody's essence to bolster his own without Peachbody realizing. Eventually Dreadwing purged and discarded what was left of Peachbody's deteriorated essence.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">What was left of Peachbody was discovered by the Saurians, an ancient Earth race of hyper-intelligent dinosaurs. They hooked him into their machines and used his genius to advance their technology. This further eroded his mind, and the Saurians convinced him he was a Saurian noble named Befadoc. At some point, he was wired into the Saurian super-weapon Gigliathon which he piloted during the Amonian/Dragon rebellion against the Saurians. It is suggested he was forced to flee when the battle turned against him. From there his essence somehow wound up stored in a Draconic temple in Jade realm within a mymior, a draconic computer. Gina later found this mymior and reconstructed what had happened to Peachbody. She finally felt obligated to put it out of its misery as an act of mercy.</p>",
