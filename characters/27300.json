    "description": "<h3>Origin</h3><p>She was born Viking, second child to Marion. When Christians invaded their land Marion was able to escape with her two daughters. Marion was worried for her daughters lives and begged <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49426\" href=\"/odin/4005-49426/\" slug=\"odin\">Odin</a> to come and rescue them. He came and took them away, he also gave Marion part of his Odin-force which would be passed on to her next child. They then were raised by him as his own and they became valkyries. They aged slowly as all asgardians.</p><h3>Genocide</h3><p>In search of the chosen one Vandala finds <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1847\" href=\"/lady-death/4005-1847/\" slug=\"lady-death\">Lady Death</a> drifting in unknown. She tries to influence her to not look into the past and embrace her future. Being desperate, she then sends Lady Death to the three tests: Heroism, Loyalty and Bravery. But she fails to teach her of these ways. Upon summoning Lady Death back to her, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53459\" href=\"/asteroth/4005-53459/\" slug=\"asteroth\">Asteroth</a> intervenes and spell is misplaced. She manages to escape from Asteroth’s hands, but she also lost Lady Death’s whereabouts.</p><p>Many months go by and she is finally able to find Lady Death. She warns her of Asteroth’s intention to kill her. He kills all in the realm where Lady Death was sent, in doing so he reawakened Lady Death warrior side, what was exactly What Vandala was trying to achieve. She then told Lady Death that Asgard is in need of saving and it will play a role in her future.</p><p>Vandala leads Lady Death to Asgard, before the current leader, Frigga, who tells Lady Death that she is half-sister of Vandala and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51755\" href=\"/vulnavia/4005-51755/\" slug=\"vulnavia\">Vulnavia</a>. Night fell and sisters went to bed. But during the slumber an <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53517\" href=\"/sinestra/4005-53517/\" slug=\"sinestra\">Sinestra</a> slits Vandala’s throat. She barely survives the attack. She is on the sickbed throughout the battle, but she is finally captured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53521\" href=\"/genocide/4005-53521/\" slug=\"genocide\">Genocide</a> himself. She then is bound to chaos machine along with her sisters Lady Death and Vulnavia. They are tricked to use the Odin-force in them to save Lady Death, this activates the chaos weapon. Tyr the traitor jumps on the artifact, tilting it a little. The weapon misses nexus and chaos does not win that day. It hits the sun, corrupting it, until it goes nova. Vandala goes to save valkyries while Lady Death battles with Genocide. Vandala, Vulnavia and Lady Death are the last to go from that world.</p><h3>Armageddon</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/506443-vandala_azrael.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506443\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1766467065868\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/506443-vandala_azrael.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506443\"><img alt=\"Joining The Fight\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/506443-vandala_azrael.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/506443-vandala_azrael.jpg 668w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/506443-vandala_azrael.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Joining The Fight</figcaption></figure><p>Vandala and her sisters return to Asgard, Lady Death soon returns to Hell. Vandala’s and Vulnavia’s life is peaceful, until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42482\" href=\"/purgatori/4005-42482/\" slug=\"purgatori\">Purgatori</a> arrives to claim her god hood. They meet Odin, who gives Vandala part of his Odin-force. Vandala, Vulnavia and Frigga are able to escape from slaughter into Transdaemonium. Unfortunately their luck will not hold.</p><p>They meet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53540\" href=\"/matthias/4005-53540/\" slug=\"matthias\">Matthias</a>, Lady Death’s father and then Purgatori arrives, while they fight. She kills Frigga and possesses Vulnavia with her blood. Vandala has no option to escape again. She goes on the search for Lady Death.

She tries to convince Lady Death not to attack heaven, but fails at that. But she announces that she will be no part of it. Soon after that they are attacked by Purgatori, in fierce battle she is finally beaten. There Vandala swears vengeance to Purgatori and release for Vulnavia’s soul.</p><p>Later she assists <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52611\" href=\"/oblivia/4005-52611/\" slug=\"oblivia\">Oblivia</a> gathering artifacts to defeat <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53778\" href=\"/armageddon/4005-53778/\" slug=\"armageddon\">Armageddon</a> himself. Chaos falls and it bring end to the world.</p><h3>New Beginning</h3><p>Vandala roams arctic wasteland in search of Lady Death. Lady Death comes into her rescue and brings her to her stronghold, Winterhaven. Together they go on the quest to gather their old allies. They meet a thief and a black knight called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53458\" href=\"/ravenheart/4005-53458/\" slug=\"ravenheart\">Ravenheart</a> on their travels. Next they seek out Grimnir and Brock. They then travel to demon kingdom to gain knowledge of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53475\" href=\"/nocturne/4005-53475/\" slug=\"nocturne\">Nocturne</a>’s location. Nocturne is daughter of Armageddon. They go to Nocturne’s lair to rescue <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48781\" href=\"/cremator/4005-48781/\" slug=\"cremator\">Cremator</a> and to stop her. Stop her they do, but it won’t stop the fall of darkness. Abaddon took her armies as his own and war continued.</p><p>Lady Death sends Vandala on a search for Living Chalice of Light. A weapon that could destroy Abaddon. She takes flight and travels the world. She travels to Purgatori’s Empire and finds her sister Vulnavia, who still is infected with blood-lust. Vandala found refuge in Aeries of Fallen, a place where largest fragment of heaven fell. After some time she continues her quest for the chalice. She at last finds a cavern, where lives Ruyin, spawn of the dark side of Asgard. In fighting him Vandala realizes that being the last survivor, all the Odin-force what was spread among the valkyries has directed to her. And she is the Living Chalice of Light. Vandala realizes that she can create Asgard anew. She sends Lady Death the message, that she will not aid her in battle against Abaddon. Lady Death renounces the blood and swears revenge for her betrayal. Lady Death is able to find Vandala, and goes for battle. The two are equally strong, the battle rages in draw. Then Ravenheart arrives and informs Lady Death that Nocturne’s grimoire is stolen. Lady Death promises to finish the battle on another day. In her battle with Purgatori, lady death is beaten.</p><p>Vandala arrives and takes her sister back to Winterhaven. In doing so Lady Death says that she has earned a right to live. Vandala stays near Lady Death’s sick bed while she battles her inner demons. Some time later Vandala takes lead of Lady Death forces, and forms an alliance with The Demon Empire, Fallen angels and Purgatori. Vandala proposes to wage the war in two fronts. Lady Death leads the alliance armies in direct combat while Vandala ignites Aurora the Golden Star to end Abaddon’s darkness. The battle is victorious, Abaddon is defeated and Golden Star has pushed back the veil of darkness.</p><h3>Newgard</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/319307-160327-vandala.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-319307\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.39\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/319307-160327-vandala.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-319307\"><img alt=\"Pagan Helping\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/319307-160327-vandala.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/319307-160327-vandala.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Pagan Helping</figcaption></figure><p>After Lady Death disappears, Vandala prepares for the new Asgard creation.

It is believed that Fentara was one of the Green Lanterns murdered by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52006\" href=\"/legion/4005-52006/\" slug=\"legion\">LEGION</a>, as the monster made its way towards <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">Oa</a> to exact revenge against the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-universe\">Guardians of the Universe</a>. In one of Hal Jordan's earliest missions, Jordan encountered LEGION and accessed the files from the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">power rings</a> of those Lanterns whom the villain had already destroyed. Among those rings was the ring of the Green Lantern of Space Sector 2815. Following his death, Fentara's ring passed to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53448\" href=\"/ebikar-hrui/4005-53448/\" slug=\"ebikar-hrui\">Ebikar Hrui</a>, and later, to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50621\" href=\"/blish/4005-50621/\" slug=\"blish\">Blish</a> of Graxos V. When Blish fell in battle, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2046\" href=\"/arisia/4005-2046/\" slug=\"arisia\">Arisia</a> was selected by the Guardians to wield the ring her father had once worn.</p><p>Fentara is memorialized in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50762\" href=\"/fallen-lanterns/4060-50762/\" slug=\"fallen-lanterns\">Crypts of Oa</a>, alongside other fallen members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\" href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" slug=\"green-lantern-corps\">Green Lantern Corps</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps</h3><p>When Fentara returns home to Graxos IV he gets a warm welcome from his daughter Arisia. He then uses his ring to help Arisia train to be a great Green Lantern. He even gives her a first edition book, \"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps\" by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10449\" href=\"/tomar-re/4005-10449/\" slug=\"tomar-re\">Tomar Re</a>. Fentara then takes Arisia to Oa and introduces her to other Lanterns, such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49746\" href=\"/greet/4005-49746/\" slug=\"greet\">Greet</a>.</p><p>A year later Fentara accidentally wakes Arisia, while charging his ring for the battle with LEGION. He is able to say good bye and i love you to his daughter before he flies off to meet his death.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Kuro is a devious and almost crazy former pirate. He was a captian for the black cat pirates. While he was a pirate he was very successful with his crew. But, Kuro did not like the pirate life. He was chased alot by the Marines. After he grew tired of his life he made a plan to leave behind his pirate life and make people think he had died. He had moved to village where he had made a plan to become rich. He has a rich family hire him as a butler named Clahadour. They had no idea about his past life and what he had done. When the rich family had died he was left to take care of a sick girl named Kaya. He had all the people from the village trust him. During this time he was secretly making contact with his old crew. He would have his crew create promblems for the village. While he had Kaya sign a will giving Kuro her fortune. Then he would kill her and have his crew to take the blame. This plan had been foiled thanks to Luffy. Kuro tends to fight with gloves that have claws on the end of them and could move at super speeds. Kuro has created a great hate for Luffy and Ussop. Luffy seems to think he's a weak man who ran away from his own pirate life. After all of his plans were destroyed he returned to the pirate life with his old crew. Kuro gained a deep hate for Luffy and will not hesitate to attack him. One extra thing that i learned is that Kuro has his glasses fall down alot and he always pushes them back up with the palm of his hand. It is said that it is a habit.</p><p>Powers </p><p>Kuro has the ability to move at super speeds and not make a single noise. He also is a great fighter and uses gloves that have knifes on the end of them. Kuro is known for making up great plans and is very smart.</p>",

    "deck": "Buggy is a \"flashy\" pirate captain who dresses himself as a clown. Buggy has consumed a Devil Fruit called Bara Bara no Mi, and this gave him the power to split his body into pieces. But, it also took away his ability to swim. He was an apprentice on Gol D. Roger's ship.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Buggy is a captain for a pirate crew named Buggy Pirates. He once was a crew-mate of Red-Haired Shanks but, left them to be a captian and have a ship of his own. Buggy loves to destroy villages using a type of bomb called Buggy balls. Buggy once was a normal human who was a crew mate of the Shanks, the captain that gave <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47924\" href=\"/luffy/4005-47924/\">Luffy</a> his hat. While on the ship Buggy found a treasure map that lead to a treasure in the ocean. So he stole a piece of devils fruit to sell so he could have enough money to go find the treasure. But, when Shanks found this out he made Buggy eat the fruit. When Buggy ate the fruit it destroyed his plans because the fruit made it so Buggy couldn't swim. But, later he finds out it also gave him the power to split his body up into pieces. When someone would try to cut him into pieces it wouldn't harm him at all because that's part of his power. Buggy then left and along the way found Luffy and Zolo. Buggy tried to kill them both but, in the end Buggy had been defeated. Buggy then wants revenge on Luffy and when he finally tracks down Luffy Cabaji has Luffy held at the same place where Gold Roger was killed. Buggy then tried to kill Luffy again but, knowing Luffy he escaped from near death. Buggy and Luffy would cross each others paths more than once and Buggy always tries to kill Luffy. Buggy still goes around terrorizing villages and will never back down from a fight with Luffy and his crew. He has unknowingly meet and begun traveling with Luffy's brother Ace.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Buggy's appearance has been through a few changes throughout the series. Although his clothing has never been changed, the design of his face-paint has underwent some modifications.</p><h3>First Appearance</h3><p>In his first appearance, he had two blue lines above both of his eyes and wore red lipstick. There were also crossbones going down the upper portion of his face, starting at the forehead and ending beneath his eyes.</p><h3>Second Appearance</h3><p>Buggy's look changed during later appearances. He retained his red lips, but instead of crossbones there was a greenish-blue cross in the middle of his forehead. He also had a crescent-like design beneath each of his eyes and a streak on the middle of his chin. The overall design resembled the shape of an anchor.</p><h3>Third Appearance</h3><p>When his face-paint changed again, the color of his lips became green, with a curvy line going down both sides of his face. Both eyes were encircled with green eyeliner, both sides of his head had two green dots, and there were four big green dots on the rim of his hat. The overall design resembled the shape of a paw-print.</p><h3>Fourth Appearance</h3><p>Afterwards, Buggy recovered his original look: red nose, red lips, and crossbones going down his face.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><ul><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Height: Unknown</li><li>Weight: Unknown</li><li>Eye Color: Black</li><li>Hair Color: Blue</li><li>Skin Color: White</li></ul><p><b>Unusual Physical Characteristics:</b> The big red nose on his face is actually his real nose.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><ul><li>Capable fighter</li><li>High endurance and resilience</li><li>Adequate physical strength</li><li>Extraordinary luck</li><li>Formidable chemist</li><li>Power to separate his body parts and still control them. Since Buggy can do that when people cut off his body parts it doesn't matter and it won't effect him.</li><li>Good swordsman</li></ul><p>Buggy is a capable fighter, able to hold his ground during numerous battles with the Whitebeard Pirates. His Devil Fruit may have given him enhanced endurance and resilience, able to survive Muggy Ball explosions without any serious injuries. He is also adept in chemistry, capable of creating highly-explosive cannon balls. Buggy can lift heavy objects with one arm, proving to be stronger than an average human. In addition, he is extremely lucky, escaping life-threatening situations at the right moment and achieving victory from plain luck. Consumption of the Devil Fruit has given him the ability to split his body into separate pieces while maintaining control of them independent of each other. This makes him immune to slashing, cutting and cleaving attacks.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><ul><li>His arrogance and greed usually gets the best of him, preventing him from fighting at his fullest.</li><li>Buggy like everyone who has consumed a Devil Fruit cannot swim.</li><li>He cannot use a component part if it is restrained.</li><li>He may lose body parts if he lacks the direct eye sight to guide them back to him.</li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Robin is the daughter of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/nico-olivia/4005-86014/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86014\">Nico Olivia</a>, one of the prominent scholars of Ohara. When Robin was very young, she was left to live with relatives when Olivia left on the Ohara research vessel. She was already treated poorly by her family, and became more of an outcast after she found and ate the Bloom-Bloom Devil Fruit. She didn't have any friends, except the few scholars of the island. Robin educated herself, and graduated as a scholar at a young age. She hoped that she could join her mother on an expedition if she ever returned. However, the scholars, led by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/professor-clover/4005-89383/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89383\">Professor Clover</a>, refused to let Robin join them in their forbidden research on the Poneglyphs.</p><p>One day, Robin found a giant washed ashore named <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/jaguar-d-saul/4005-89224/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89224\">Saul</a>. The two became friends, but he warned her of an impending attack on the island once he learned he was on Ohara. Robin rushed back to find the towns already being shelled by the Navy ships. She found Clover and scholars, and an unknown woman with white hair being held by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/spandam/4005-54445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54445\">Spandam</a>. As Spandam started to drag the woman away, something triggered in Robin. She called out asking if she was her mother Olivia. Olivia denied it to avoid implicating Robin, but she only pushed the issue and declared to everyone's surprise that she could read the poneglypths. Spandam ran from the Buster Call he initiated and left Olivia behind. The two finally had their reunion, but it was short lived. Olivia passed Robin onto Saul to escape the island as she stayed behind to help save the research of the island.</p><p>Robin and Saul's escape was cut short by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/aokiji/4005-67028/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67028\">Kuzan</a>. Before Saul died, he told Robin that one day she would come across friends that would protect her. Robin ran, but Kuzan found her. Oddly enough, he provided her an escape off the island. From her small boat, she watched as Ohara was destroyed by the Navy. Through her tears, she tried to laugh in the way Saul had taught her. She was the island's only survivor.</p><p>The <a href=\"/world-government/4060-59379/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59379\">World Government </a>had placed the blame of Ohara's destruction on the scholars, and a bounty of 79 Million was placed on her at the age of six. Robin spent the rest of her years on the run. Everywhere she went, she was quickly betrayed for the bounty. At 8, she joined a pirate crew, at 16, she joined some organization, and she betrayed all of them before they could turn on her. When she was twenty-four, she joined <a href=\"/baroque-works/4060-51658/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51658\">Baroque Works</a> for<a href=\"/sir-crocodile/4005-48022/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48022\"> Sir Crocodile</a>, one of the <a href=\"/shichibukai/4060-48019/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48019\">Seven Warlords</a>, with the hope of finding a poneglyph on Alabasta. Robin's goal was to find he Rio Poneglyth and complete the Ohara scholars' research into the the thousand year void in the world's history.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1089922\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/1089922-one_piece_vol_13.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 1540px\" data-ratio=\"1.338961038961\" data-width=\"1540\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/1089922-one_piece_vol_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1089922\"><img alt=\"One Piece Vol. 13 JPN (Apr 2000)\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38919/1089922-one_piece_vol_13.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/1089922-one_piece_vol_13.jpg 1540w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/38919/1089922-one_piece_vol_13.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38919/1089922-one_piece_vol_13.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38919/1089922-one_piece_vol_13.jpg 477w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px\" data-width=\"477\"></a><figcaption>One Piece Vol. 13 JPN (Apr 2000)</figcaption></figure><p>Nico Robin (ニコ・ロビン, Niko Robin) is a main character of the series <a href=\"http://www.animevice.com/one-piece/10-55/\" rel=\"nofollow\">One Piece</a>, that was created by <a href=\"/eiichiro-oda/4040-55855/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-55855\">Eiichiro Oda</a>.

She has a deep love for history and knowledge. Her initial appearance was that of an antagonist, but her loyalties to the Baroque Worlds was put into question almost immediately. She had lived most of her life in the shadows in order to survive and achieve her goal of discovering the truth about the 100 year Void in the world's history. She was initially using the Straw Hats but quickly found herself attached to the small crew. She even attempted to sacrifice herself to save them from the wrath of the World Government, but they came after her. This was when she truly felt she was a member of their crew.</p><p>An aspect of her character that wasn't explored as much in the English publication was the level of emotional distance Robin kept. When she first joined the crew she never used the crew's names but addressed them by their crew positions. <i>(i.e. Luffy was \"Captain\" and Nami was \"Miss Navigator\")</i>. It was only after the Enies Looby Arc that Robin began using their names. This personality change was a subtle touch that Eiichiro Oda used to show her attachment to her new friends. This loyalty was shown at Sabaody Archipelago where they met Silvers Rayleigh, the first-mate of Gold Roger. He had offered to tell her what they had learned about the lost century, but she turned it down since her journey with the Straw Hats was just as important to her.</p><p>After the two year time skip in the series, Robin is now 30 years old, but much of her appearance has not changed. The most dramatic difference is in those two years her hair has grown dramatically longer, and the extend of her evolved powers has yet to be revealed.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span>Baroque Works Saga - Whiskey Peak Arc</span></h3><p>Robin held the name of \"Miss All Sunday\" while being an agent and vice-president of the Baroque Works organization. During that time, she allowed <a href=\"/nefertari-vivi/4005-56114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56114\">Princess Vivi</a> of Alabasta infiltrate the organization to learn Crocodile was the leader, and the one instigating the civil was in her country. When Robin traveled to Whiskey Peak, she found Vivi with the <a href=\"/straw-hat-pirates/4060-51871/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51871\">Straw Hat Pirates</a>.</p><p>She tried offering them an Eternal Pose to follow a safer path to Alabasta. However, <a href=\"/luffy/4005-47924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47924\">Luffy</a> broke it, saying that he would not allow her to decide their destination. They rejected any aid she was offering, so she left without further incident.</p><h3>Baroque Works Saga - Alabasta Arc</h3><p>Robin preformed her duties of the Baroque Works and organized the officers, but she wasn't aiming for the same goal of taking over the nation. When the Straw Hats invaded Crocodile's headquarters in Rainbase, Robin defeated <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/pell/4005-89361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89361\">Pell</a> to abduct Vivi, she later remained silent as she watched <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sanji/4005-49899/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49899\">Sanji</a> slip in to save the crew as Crocodile had been detracted into leaving, and she rescued Luffy from the sandy grave he had been left in after his defeat to Crocodile. She left him with Pell as she headed for Alubarna.</p><p>She forced <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/nefertari-cobra/4005-89318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89318\">Cobra</a>, the king, to the tombs where the poneglyth was hidden, but she had to defeat a group of Navy, led by <a href=\"/tashigi/4005-84559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84559\">Tashigi</a>, after one had recognized her. While reading the poneglyth, she learned it was just the location of another weapon, but she lied to Crocodile and told him it was just the nation's history. She tried to kill Crocodile, but stabbed her first with his hook. Luffy defeated Crocodile but had been infected with a poison. Robin passed the cure to Cobra to give to Luffy. Robin was ready to die in the collapsing tombs, but Luffy grabbed her up, along with the king, and escaped despite her protests to be left.</p><p>Robin then stowed away aboard the Going Merry, and stayed hidden until the Straw Hats had escaped the Naval pursuit. As retribution for saving her life despite her wish to die, she asked Luffy to let her join his crew. Luffy accepted, despite the objections of most of the crew.</p><h3>Jaya Arc</h3><p>After the St. Briss fell from the sky and their log pose pointed upward, Robin convinced her Straw Hats of the existence of a Sky Islands. While she investigated the is;and of Jaya for clues, she found information about a man named <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/montblanc-cricket/4005-89309/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89309\">Montblanc Cricket</a>. He aided the Straw Hats to modify their ship to use the Knock-Up Stream to launch them into the Sky Islands.</p><h3>Skypiea Arc</h3><p>Their impromptu vacation on Skypiea was cut short as they became wanted by the forces of <a href=\"/eneru/4005-54245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54245\">God Eneru</a>. Robin was abducted with much of the crew aboard the Going Merry and taken to an sacrificial alter in Upper Yard. She investigated the island with Zoro and Nami, and they discovered that Upper Yard was originally a part of Jaya, shot into the sky by the the Knock-Up Stream. Which meant the legendary city of gold of Jaya must be there. The crew planned to raid the city, but they got separated as the Shandians were fighting Eneru's forces. After defeating <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/yama/4005-89487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89487\">Yama</a>, Robin was the first to find the city stripped of all the gold. She also discoverd Eneru there, and she was struck down by his lightning powers, along with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/roronoa-zoro/4005-47925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47925\">Zoro</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wyper/4005-89486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89486\">Wyper</a>, and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/gan-fall/4005-89176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89176\">Gan Fall</a>.</p><p>Robin woke up just before Luffy defeated Eneru and stopped him from destroying the island. As Robin wondered the island, the day after the party, she discovered the Belfry Bell had a poneglyth attached to it. Though it was just about another weapon, what caught her attention was a message from <a href=\"/gol-d-roger/4005-72499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72499\">Gold Roger</a>, the pirate king, written in the language of the poneglyth. It was then that she realized that the Rio Poneglyth could very well be out there, and she may find it if she kept traveling with the Straw Hats. The crew then returned to the Blue Sea with a load of treasure.</p><h3>Davy Back Fight Arc</h3><p>At Longring Longland, the crew was blocked from escape by the Foxy Pirates and got drawn into he Davy Back Fight. Robin took part in the water race around the island, but they lost due to <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/foxy/4005-89151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89151\">Foxy's</a> intervention with his Slow-Slow Beam. The crew lost <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/tony-tony-chopper/4005-51969/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51969\">Chopper</a> to the Foxy crew, but gained him back by winning the next round. As Robin watched the fight between Luffy and Foxy, she saw that Luffy truly was the kind of person who would rather die than leave any of his crew behind. It was then she realized that this crew was unlike any she had ever seen before.</p><h3>Water Seven Arc</h3><p>With the Davy Back Fight over, the crew were confronted by Kuzan, now known as Admiral Aokiji. She lashed out at him as he was revealing too much about her past, and he in turn nearly killed her by freezing her. Luffy was also frozen in the act of saving her. She was safely thawed out by Chopper, and Aokiji didn't follow. However on Water Seven, she was confronted by the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/cipher-pol-no-9/4060-54443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54443\">CP-9</a>. She'd normally run and hide, but she agreed to help them in order to protect the Straw Hats. The plan to assassinate <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/iceberg/4005-89205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89205\">Iceberg</a>, mayor of Water Seven, failed in the first attempt, but she confessed to Iceberg that she was trying to protect her crew during the second attack.</p><p>The Straw Hats arrived to stop her, but she left with the CP-9 to leave for Enies Lobby. She knew this would only lead to her death, but it was to allow her friends to leave the island safely. During the ride on the sea train, Sanji, Usopp, calling himself Sogeking; and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/franky/4005-54305/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54305\">Franky</a> tried to save Robin. Though they nearly succeeded, she turned on them to leave with the CP-9. Usopp told her to believe in Luffy.</p><h3>Eneis Lobby Arc</h3><p>Luffy and the rest of the crew invaded Enies Lobby to rescue Robin, and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/spandam/4005-54445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54445\">Spandam</a>, son of Spandine, betrayed their deal to let the Straw Hats go. Shackled by <a href=\"/sea-prism-stone/4055-57347/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57347\">sea prism stone</a>, she couldn't fight back. When Luffy appeared, she shouted at him for following her becasue she wanted to die. As Spandam mocked Luffy and the crew for defying the World Government, Luffy ordered Usopp to burn the World Government flag, in bold act to prove he would be willing to declare war on the world to save Robin. Robin was over come. These were the people that Saul told her about. They would risk anything for her, and she finally declared her wish to live and leave with them.</p><p>Spandam dragged Robin, escorted by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/rob-lucci/4005-48069/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48069\">Rob Lucci</a>, toward the Gates of Justice. The Straw Hats had to fight the CP-9 to find the one with the key to her cuffs, and she tried resisting to buy them time. In return, she was beaten by Spandam. Was they were nearing closer, she was saved by Usopp and Franky, with the key to the cuffs. Robin helped the crew fight off the Buster Call that arrived to destroy the island as they waited for Luffy to defeated Lucci. They all escaped aboard the Going Merry, but Robin used her powers to break Spadam's back before the escaped. Sadly, the Going Merry broke in half on the way back to Water Seven, and they were forced to give the Going Merry a viking funeral.</p><p>During the party at Water Seven to celebrate their victory, Aokiji approached Robin in secret. He revealed that Saul had been a friend of his, and that's why he let her escape as a child. Though he had become concerned by her string of betrayals and involvement in Baroque Works. Aokiji noticed that she had changed now, and he left. Soon after, the Straw Hats were now all wanted, and Robin's bounty was raised to 80 million. Franky was encouraged to join the crew by Robin forcing the issue with her powers on him, and the crew sailed off on their new ship, the <a href=\"/thousand-sunny/4055-56580/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56580\">Thousand Sunny</a>.</p><h3>Thriller Bark Arc</h3><p>While sailing through the Florian Triangle, the crew ran across a ghost ship with a talking skeleton named <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/brook/4005-54306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54306\">Brook</a>, and the ship was captured in the gates of <a href=\"/thriller-bark/4020-58054/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58054\">Thriller Bark</a>, a floating island ship. The crew investigated the island to find Nami, Usopp, and Chopper, and they found it swarming with zombies and other odd creatures. Much of the crew was captured and had their shadows stolen by <a href=\"/gecko-moria/4005-48021/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48021\">Gecko Moria</a>, one of the Warlords. Franky and Robin fought with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/taralan/4005-89458/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89458\">Taralan</a> but were saved by Brook.</p><p>The Straw Hats all united to fight the giant <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/oars/4005-89329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89329\">Oars</a>, who was powered by Luffy's shadow; and he was further boosted by Gecko Moria's powers. During this fight, Moria stole Robin's shadow stolen. Together, they defeated Oars, and Luffy defeated Moria to put everyone's shadows back. While Luffy was out, the crew was knocked out by a shock wave of <a href=\"/bartholomew-kuma/4005-69027/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69027\">Bartholomew Kuma</a>, another Warlord. Robin listened in to a later conversation and learned that Zoro had offered his own life in place of Luffy, but she kept the secret of his injuries.</p><h3>Sabaody Archipelago Arc</h3><p>Upon reaching the Red Line, the crew ran across a young mermaid named <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/camie/4005-89106/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89106\">Camie</a>. They rescued her friend <a href=\"/hatchan/4005-72322/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72322\">Hatchan</a>, then he led them to Sabaody Archipelago to find a coating engineer, so they could travel to Fish-Man Island. Robin and Nami were shopping when they received word that Camie had been abducted to be sold into slavery. Robin arrived as the slave auction had turned into a brawl, thanks to Luffy. They escaped with <a href=\"/silvers-rayleigh/4005-72490/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72490\">Silvers Rayleigh</a>, the first mate of Gold Roger. He told them the truth behind Roger's capture, and he offered to tell her what they had learned about the void century. However, Robin elected to continue her journey with her friends. and Rayleigh had suggested that they may have moved too fast and she may come to a different solution.</p><p>The crew tried going into hiding while they waited for the ship to be coated, but they were cut off by a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/px-series/4005-89384/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89384\">cybernetic copy of Bartholomew Kuma</a>.

He used his powers to cast away each one of the Straw Hats, despite Luffy's attempts to stop him.</p><h3>Lost Friends Mini Arc</h3><p>Robin landed on an giant bridge that was being constructed in the <a href=\"/east-blue/4020-56304/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56304\">East Blue</a> called Tequila Wolf. She was captured, cuffed with sea stone, and they knew who she was. Though they had no idea how she suddenly arrived. They tortured Robin to try and get information about her crew, but she refused to talk. One night, she was able to escape as the Revolutionary Army was attacking to free the slaves that were being forced to construct this bridge.</p><h3>Dawn Island Arc</h3><p>The Revolutionaries revealed they've been looking for her for about ten years and informed her that Luffy had taken part in the Paramount War alone, and he had witnessed the death of his brother, <a href=\"/portgas-d-ace/4005-47943/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47943\">Ace</a>.

Robin was teamed with Law and Usopp to drop off Caesar. The group fought through the fighting fish along the bridge, but they found Navy on Green Bit and Little People. Robin got captured and taken to the underground Tontatta Kingdom. She convinced them she wasn't an enemy, but they were going to strip her for refusing to give them weapons. She was saved due to her association with Usopp, who had convinced him he was a great hero.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Bloom-Bloom Fruit</h3><p>As a young child Robin ate the Bloom-Bloom Devil Fruit (ハナハナの実, Hana Hana no Mi). This enables her to cause any part of her body to bloom anywhere within her line of sight. She isn't a physically strong person, but her abilities allow her to strike from a distance and requires a certain level of concentration. She also feels the pain that is inflicted on these grown limbs. When using any of her abilities there are flower petals floating in the air, and when her grown limbs disappear they normally evaporate into flower petals. She uses these powers to more often bind her enemies or break bones from a safe distance.</p><p>During Robin's two years with the Revolutionaries, Robin was able to train and grow her powers to the point of being able to quickly grow enormous segments of her body, such as hands, arms, and legs, to strike at her opponents. Later, she revealed that she could even copy her entire body from flowers and use as a decoy.</p><p><b>Attack Names</b></p><p>The patters in the names of Robin's attacks always start with a word in Spanish. Normally, meaning the number of limbs she wishes to produce. The suffix is the word Fluer, French for flower. Often times followed by a certain command of the attack.</p><h3>Intelligence</h3><p>Robin has a genius level intellect that allowed her to graduate at the age of eight to the level of an archeologist. She has traveled over much of the world, and she can speak and read an unknown amount of languages.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p>One of the major weakness that comes with Robin's paramecia-type fruits is that the limbs she grows can be injured, and they are limited by her own level of strength. If these extra limbs and struck or wounded, she will feel the pain in her own body. Robin avoids this by canceling her attacks before they can be hit.</p><h3>Sea Water</h3><p>All devil fruit users share one similar weakness. That is the ocean. The incredible power of the devil fruit renders the user a complete inability to swim. Once in water, they will sink like a stone. In sea water, a devil fruit user will also lose all strength in in their body.</p><h3>Sea Prism Stone</h3><p>Sea Prism Stone is a naturally occurring metal fund in the world. Minerals from the sea are embedded into the metal. It's said that sea prism stone is as hard as diamonds, and contact to the skin will both weaken the body and cancel out all devil fruit powers. they'll be as vulnerable as any other human. This is often found crafted into shackles.</p><h3>Haki</h3><p><a href=\"/haki/4015-56190/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56190\">Haki </a>(覇気, Haki) is a unique skill that all devil fruit users are vulnerable. Armament Haki has the ability to cancel out any devil fruit power, however, the haki of the attacker must be stronger than the target. Robin hasn't been shown to use any of the haki techniques.</p><h2>Statistics</h2><p><b>Age:</b> 30 <i>(28 pre-time skip)</i></p><p><b>Hair :</b> Black</p><p><b>Height:</b> 6' 2\" <i>(188cm)</i></p><p><b>Measurements:</b> 39-23-35 <i>(99-59-89cm)</i></p><p><b>Distinguishing Marks:</b> Bird shaped eyes<b>/</b>Pointed nose</p><p><b>Favorites:</b> Historic sites/books/coffee</p><p><b>Crew Position:</b> Archeologist</p><p><b>Specialty:</b> Language/Intel/Assassination</p><p><b>Devil Fruit:</b> Hana-Hana Fruit (Paramecia)</p><p><b>Dream:</b> Find the Rio Poneglyph</p><p><b>First Bounty:</b> 79,000,000 <i>(Beli)</i></p><p><b>Current Bounty:</b> 80,000,000 <i>(Beli)</i></p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Anime</h3><h4>One Piece (1999)</h4><p>The <i>One Piece</i> animated series is a direct adaptation of Oda's original manga..

    "deck": "Ulquiorra is an Arrancar in Sōsuke Aizen's army. He is also the 4th Espada. You can see the leftovers from a hollow mask on the top left side of his head.",
    "description": "<h2>General Information</h2><p>Birthday: December 1</p><p>Height: 5'6\"'</p><p>Weight: 121lbs</p><p>Eyes: Green</p><p>Hair: Black</p><p>Race: Hollow</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Ulquiorra is a thin but muscular Arrancar. He has shaggy black hair and green eyes with pupils similar to a cat. He has green lines that descend from his eyes that make him look like he's crying. He wears the typical Arrancar uniform, but his jacket has a longer coattails and a higher collar. than others. Ulquiorra is almost always seen with a melancholic/emotionless expression on his face. The remains of his hollow mask appear as a broken horned helmet on his head. This has lead to speculations that he is a Vasto Lorde, as the silhouette of the Vasto Lorde is similar to the silhouette of Ulquiorra. His hollow hole was initially located at the base of his throat, but was later changed to his sternum. His Espada number is tattooed on his chest.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Ulquiorra has been shown to be very aloof and callous, looking down on all those whom he judges as beneath him. He has not shown any care or respect to any who are weaker than him, even watching his partner <a href=\"../../yammy/29-55502/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Yammy</a> kill other Arrancar with no care. In fact, he has shown himself capable of non-lethal violence towards Yammy in return, hitting him to get his attention. He deems anyone below him 'trash', pawns to be played, used and discarded: expendable assets under Aizen. He has a particularly difficult time understanding human emotions, such as love. He professes that since he cannot see emotions with his enhanced vision, that they are a lie and cannot exist, as his eye is capable of seeing through anything. It is perhaps due to this eye technique that he is deeply analytical of any situation or individual he comes across, and in combat he prefers to stand back and let Yammy do the combat merely remarking on the opponents abilities and advising Yammy of their abilities, his own potentials (and failings) etc. When confronted by a opponent he deems unworthy, he even refuses to draw his sword to fight them, preferring to use his hand to hand combat skills and invulnerability to beat them down, though this style is not limited to Ulquiorra: all the Arrancar tend to fight in this way, as they consider using their blades on an unworthy opponent disgraceful.</p><h2>Relationships</h2><p>Ulquiorra considers all those weaker than him trash, and this attitude does not earn him much support. In particular it gets <a href=\"../../grimmjow-jeagerjaques/29-51667/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Grimmjow</a> the wrong way, and the two often argue. It was due to this argument that Grimmjow launched an attack on the real world that led to his own disgrace. Grimmjow believes that Ulquiorra is afraid of fighting him, as he believes that the conflict would destroy them both. Other than Aizen, Ulquiorra is shown to only have a respectful relationship with <a href=\"../../kaname-tosen/29-46685/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Tosen</a> and Aizen, he seems to get along with his partner Yammy well enough, though this seems to half be a relationship based on his power over Yammy than anything else. Ichigo Kurosaki is seen as Ulquiorra's main rival. But in fact, because he is weaker up to a certain point in the story, Ulquiorra refers to him as trash. But as quick as a flash Ichigo's hollow side takes over and cuts Ulquiorra to ribbons as it may seem. The final blow in fact, was dealt by Ulquiorra who impacted Ichigo with a Lancero Verde. Ulquiorra realizes at the instant, he says, \"If you don't kill me now\". Ulquiorra realizes what \"The Heart\" that Orihime mentions finally is.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Ulquiorra is the Cuarta Espada in Aizen's Arrancar force, which literally means 'Fourth Espada'. This means that he is the fourth strongest.</p><p>He possesses various abiliities, including :</p><ul><li><b>Master Swordsmanship:</b> Though he rarely uses his sword during combat, He is a highly skilled swordsman.</li><li><b>Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant:</b> This is Ulquiorra's preferred method of combat. He doesn't not draw his sword unless he considers his opponent worthy. He is fond of impaling his opponents in the chest and creating a hole there which is similar to his own hollow hole.</li><li><b>Sonido Master:</b> Ulquiorra moves at an excessively fast speed in combat, so fast that Ichigo found it hard to even discern his movements at first. In his release state, he shows an even greater level of speed, astonishing and outclassing Ichigo even further.</li><li><b>Cero:</b> Energy based attack that is released from the hand, power is ranked by color, red - green - purple-black.</li><li><b>Cero Oscuras:</b> Ulquiorra's King Cero upon resurrection its color resembles Ichigo's Getsuga in that it is entirely black. (Only used while in resurrection form.)</li><li><b>Bala:</b> This technique hardens the user's spiritual pressure and fires it like a bullet from their fist.</li><li><b>Keen Intellect.</b></li><li><b>Garganta:</b> Technique used by Espada to travel to and from Hueco Mundo.</li><li><b>High-Speed Regeneration:</b> While other Arrancar sacrifice their high-speed regeneration for power, Ulquiorra did not, he is able to regenerate very fast. However, he cannot regenerate his organs.</li><li><b>Instant Replay:</b> Used only by Ulquiorra, he is able to record events in his mind and by transforming his eye, he can display this footage to others. He is capable of copying anything he see's through the use of his eye, which he can replay to others by removing the eye (which seems to be like glass) and crushing it, at which point what he has seen is replayed. The eye seems to instantly regenerate afterwards.</li><li><b>Immense Spiritual Power.</b></li><li><b>Enhanced Hierro.</b></li><li><b>Enhanced Speed.</b></li><li><b>Enhanced Strength.</b></li><li><b>Enhanced Durability.</b></li></ul><h2>Zanpakuto</h2><p>Ulquiorra's Zanpakuto is a plain, green handled katana with a small eye shaped hole near the base of the hilt. His release command is \"bind\", and its name is \"Murus-hierago\", or Murcielago. Spanish for \"bat\" and Japanese for \"Giant Black Winged Demon\". Ulquiorra is also the only Espada capable of releasing twice, his first release form being slightly similar to his normal mode, albeit the tear marks under his eyes widening somewhat, a change of clothing, and the helmet forming entirely above the base of his head. The most notable difference in this form are the giant, looming black wings that sprout from his back.</p><p>Ulquiorra has shown a second resurrection form. He said that he is the only Arrancar to have a second resurrection form and he kept this a secret which not even Aizen knows. Although this may not be true as the other Arrancars may have kept it a secret just like him.His second resurrection form is much darker overall, and he sprouts a thin pointed tail somewhat similar to various representations of what \"The Devil\" would look like. His hollow hole enlarges greatly, and from his biceps top his hands his arms become pitch black. He loses the helmet and out from his head sprout two great white horns. His legs more animal-like, his feet becoming paws and from the waist flaps of fur flow to his knees.

    "deck": "Seto Kaiba is one of the main characters in the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga and anime. He is the president of Kaiba Corp and big brother to Mokuba, both were orphans before being adopted by Gozaburo Kaiba.",
    "description": "<h2>Early life</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">(\"Kaiba\" references Seto Kaiba, any other family members will be signified. i.e. \"Gozaburo Kaiba\")</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Seto has a little brother named Mokuba. They were both orphans until Gozaburo Kaiba decided he needed an heir, someone to inherit Kaiba Corp when he is gone. He chose Seto because he was an intelligent individual (he often played chess with him to test him). Gozaburo didn't plan on giving Kaiba Corp to Seto right away, but later, at a time he chooses. Seto, however, took initiative and came up with a plan to take over Kaiba Corp. Gozaburo owned 51% of Kaiba Corp (he actually owned 49% 2% that his advisors, the Big Five owned) Seto owned 48%, and Mokuba owned 1%. Mokuba , of course, agreed to give his 1% to his big brother. And when Seto persuaded The Five to give him their 2%, he owned 51% of Kaiba Corp, chasing his step-father, Gozaburo, out.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kaiba later fired The Five, which later try to get revenge on him. Gozaburo will later digitalize himself into a virtual world he created and, only much later, try to take Kaiba's body. It is on this occasion that The Five will try to get their revenge on Kaiba (and will fail at the hands of Yugi, Joey, Tea, Duke and Kaiba himself). Gozaburo is ultimately unsuccessful, and, eventually, destroyed along with the world he created.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kaiba Corp was a weapon factory during the time of Gozaburo Kaiba. When Seto Kaiba takes over, however, it becomes focused on the \"Duel Monsters\" card games, creating different ways to improve the game. In fact, Kaiba Corp created the Duel domes and all three versions of Duel-Discs.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kaiba is arrogant and self-centered with little time for anybody beyond himself and his younger brother Mokuba, making him a typical anti-hero.He is dismissive in his manner of speech represented in the</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">original Japanese version of the series by his omission of honorifics, and his use of the boastful word ore to mean \"I\" instead of the usual boku.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Although magical powers and items are often employed in the series , as a rational man, Kaiba does not believe in such thinks, and , when necessary , convinces himself that it is all trick and illusion.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Although this trend had a tendency to be exaggerated in the English version of the series it is present in both language versions of the anime and manga.Eventually he grudgingly comes to accept that there</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">is little other explanation for the bizarre,fantastical events he witnesses throughout the series. In a similar vein,Kaiba is shown to have an affinity for machines and as such manufactures several holographic</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">devices for Duel Monsters, and as suggested by Anzu Mazaki in the English dubbed anime , this may be the cause of his misanthropy.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kaiba changes in personality in second season in second series anime onwards.In the first season,Kaiba acknowledges Pegasus ability to read minds, as well as the \"Heart of the Cards\".Although he does not like Yugi and Jonouchi, he does not act outright hostile towards them,expect during the first episode.However,in the second season his acceptance of faith and magic vanishes and in the English anime he adopts the habit of muttering that it's \"hocus-pocus nonsense\".His desire to defeat Yugi also grows a grude to an obsession and Kaiba shows an outright disregard for the safety of Yugi and his friends.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Despite this he still often helps them whit defeating the villains they face usually claiming that Yugi or one of his friends helped him and he thus owes them or that the villain's desires are in direct conflict whit his own interests</p><h2>Deck and Strategy</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Blue-Eyes</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kaiba had \"Duel Monsters\" cards when he was a child, but his deck was very different than the one he uses later. In fact, his signature monster (the three \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" cards), were his dream since he was a child. He wanted and liked that card so much that Mokuba decided to draw him one. He, of course, never used it in a duel, but it remains as a sign of his little brother's love. Kaiba's love for the \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" card is probably what led to him ripping the only (fourth) copy of the Blue-Eyes that wasn't in his deck in two pieces. The fourth card belonged to Yugi (his grandfather actually), and Kaiba already had three Blue-Eyes Dragons in his deck (three copies of the same card are the limit for any deck), so he decided to rip it. He did it to weaken Yugi's deck and, probably, out of some sort of spite, not wanting anyone but him to have the Dragons in their deck but him. He was defeated anyway due to Yugi's \"Exodia the Forbidden One\" monster card.The Blue-Eyes remains his favorite and trademark even today.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He also has some different Blue-Eyes cards (like the ritual monster card, \"White Dragon Paladin\") and other unique cards (like \"Kaibaman\").</p><h2>Special Card</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kaiba has at one time had the Egyptian God card, \"Obelisk the Tormentor\". It was given to him by Ishizu, in hopes he will, in search for the power of the other God cards, organize a tournament that will relieve her brother, Marik, of his two god cards (which, indeed, happened in the end). Obelisk is the most powerful card that ever found it's way to Kaiba's deck. He used it in many strategies and gained many victories in the short time the Obelisk was in his possession. He lost the Obelisk to Yugi in the semi-finals of the very tournament he organized to gain more God cards. Yugi emerges from that tournament with all three Egyptian God cards in his deck.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another powerful card he had was \"The Fang of Critias\" and later \"Critias Knight\". This was a powerful card, originating from Atlantis. It had an ability unique to the Divine Dragons (\"The Eye of Timeus\", \"The Fang of Critias\" and \"The Claw of Helmos\"), cards that only those chosen and pure-hearted receieve and are able to use, and only to destroy the power of \"The Seal of Oricalcos\". The ability was to merge with other cards making them stronger (like \"Polymerization\", only without the actual card). He once used it on Yugi's \"Mirror Force\", which Yugi then used on a Dragon, creating a Mirror Dragon with a cool and powerful effect. He also used it with \"Despotskaf Wing\" on his \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", creating a \"Blue-Eyes Despotskaf Dragon\" of greater power. \"The Fang of Critias\" card was later changed into \"Critias Knight\" to allow a Fusion with \"Timeus Knight\" and \"Helmos Knight\" into a powerful Knight of Atlantis, using his effect (and defying logic) to defeat the evil Leviathan's infinite ATK and free the God cards it had consumed. The card has disappeared after Leviathan was destroyed.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In search for a way to defeat his bitter rival, Yugi Moto and his God cards, Kaiba seeks help from Pegasus, the Creator of Games. He offers his three Blue-Eyes Dragons as a stake at a duel, while Pegasus stakes one of his rare cards, the one that can defeat the God cards. Kaiba defeats Pegasus with surprising ease and takes two cards from Pegasus' batch, stating that he is a snake for telling him he only had one card to beat the Gods. Pegasus replies that there was only one, but Kaiba doesn't pay any attention. In truth, Anubis, the Egyptian Lord of the Dead, placed one of those two cards for Kaiba to take, so that by activating it, he releases Anubis from his slumber. That card was called \"The Pyramid of Light\", it's apparent effect being to remove all current God cards from play. His plan was to force Yugi to summon all of his Gods at once, remove them from play, destroy the Pyramid card (using the other card he took from Pegasus), bring back the gods using \"Return From the Different Dimension\" and defeat Yugi using his own God cards. Anubis, however, doesn't like this and he activates the Pyramid's other effect, summoning \"Andro Sphinx\" and \"Sphinx Teleia\" and merging them into \"Thenien the Ultimate Sphinx\". Thenien consumes the souls of fallen monsters, amassing an ATK of 35000. Yugi destroys the Sphinx with the other card taken from Pegasus by Kaiba, the \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\". This Dragon can only be summoned by offering \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\" as a tribute. Although Ultimate is stronger (ATK 4500 DEF 3800) than Shining (ATK 3000 DEF 3000), Shining makes up for it with his effects. His ATK and DEF are increased by 300 for every Dragon Monster in the graveyard, which means he automatically has ATK and DEF of 4200 (Blue-Eyes Ultimate and the three regular Blue-Eyes used to summon the Ultimate). His other effect is called \"Shining Nova\" and it destroys the Shining Dragon and another card on the field. It is also immune to any Spells, Traps and monster effects, making it fairly difficult to destroy. After the events in \"Yu-Gi-Oh: The movie: The Pyramid of Light\", the Pyramid card shatters, and the Shining Dragon is still, officially, in Kaiba's possession. The reason he doesn't use it in duels in unknown.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">|Deck|</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kaiba's deck is composed mostly of Dragon type monsters and spells and traps that support them. He doesn't use exclusively Dragons, though and will use other powerful cards. Being an intelligent individual, he often uses different powerful combinations of cards (some of them are painfully simple, yet brutally effective) and is willing to make sacrifices to further his cause. He is a great, intelligent duelist, with a deck and a wit to match. His only real weaknesses are his overconfidence and lack of patience when he's losing.</p><h2>Arcs</h2><h2>Duel Kingdom</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Maximillion Pegasus, the creator of games (Duel Monsters - he created the game) decides to hold a tournament on his private island and decides to call it Duel Kingdom. The tournament's supposed cause is to find a new King of Games, but in truth, Pegasus wants to collect souls for a dark spell to bring his dead wife back to life. The tournament system was the following: all contestants arrive by a (very large) ship they are given a duel gauntlet and a duel bracer. The bracer has 10 slots for 10 star tokens. Star tokens are won by winning duels and one needs 10 to participate in the finals. If one loses all tokens, he is out and goes home by the first boat. As if the cheating dorks who try to steal the tokens (rather than earn them) aren't enough, Pegasus let \"Eliminators\" loose on the island. They have larger bracers and usually around both wrists that can hold 20 or even 30 star tokens. The use different tactics to frighten, confuse or otherwise hamper opponents mentally before dueling them to increase their chances at victory as much as possible. The most well known are the Paradox brothers and Panik. When four people collect 10 tokens they go into the castle and fight in a tournament-like duel system (they are set into groups of two and they fight the person from their group, the winners face off and the winner gets the reward) and the winner gets money and the chance to fight Pegasus for the title of the Master of games.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kaiba, however bent the rules a bit. Pegasus hacked into Kaiba Corp's system and started moving stocks to his name, slowly taking over the company. Kaiba, naturally, didn't quite like this, but when Pegasus kidnapped Mokuba, Kaiba's little brother, Kaiba decided to join the tournament and \"teach Pegasus a thing or two\". Right before the tournament, Kaiba fought Yugi and was defeated by his \"Exodia the Forbidden One\". He was hoping to meet Yugi again in the tournament to take his revenge. He defeated all competition easily (including Yugi's best friend, Joey Wheeler) and waited for Yugi at the entrance to Pegasus' castle. When Yugi came with his 10 star tokens, Kaiba appeared and gave him one of the two prototypes of the duel disc, so they could fight (Pegasus' island had special fields called \"Duel Arenas\" for fighting and duelists couldn't duel without one... until now. They put the discs on, and the duel started. Kaiba, better prepared this time faces Yugi (Kaiba doesn't know, however, that Yugi's Exodia is at the bottom of the ocean). Kaiba, with his new powerful card the \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\"(all three Blue-Eyes White Dragons(BEWD) fused together) dominates the game, until Yugi uses his weakest card - \"Kuriboh to defend from the final attack of BEUD and uses \"Poison Arrow\" to decrease BEUD's ATK from 4500 to a measley 900. Yugi is about to finish Kaiba and he decides to use a dirty trick. He stands on the edge of the castle wall saying that if Yugi attacks, Kaiba could fall and die. Yami Yugi decides to attack at first, but Tea calls out to him, and Little Yugi stops him. Mentally broken, Yugi surrenders the duel, losing five star tokens and a way into the castle. Although Kaiba had over 10 star tokens, he decided to break into Pegasus' castle and hacks into his network to get his stolen stocks back when the transfer was at 99%. He then challenges Pegasus to a duel, alone, neglecting the rules. Pegasus, however accepts, but switchs to a shadow game so Kaiba has to give his soul to Pegasus, should he lose. The duel starts and Pegasus activates his \"Toon World\" card (the effects are greatly exaggerated in the anime) and even takes BEWD away from Kaiba and uses him to beat Kaiba fairly easily (mostly because he used his Millennium Item - The Millennium Eye to see Kaiba's hand and set cards, anticipating and preventing his every strategy). Kaiba's soul is (along with Mokuba's and that of Yugi's Grandpa) captured into a special card. Pegasus is eventually defeated by Yugi and Kaiba is freed from the card (and despite his soul being captured, he still doesn't believe in magic, calling it simple trickery) and Pegasus returns Kaiba Corp to him. Kaiba returns home and thinks of a way to defeat Yugi, now King of Games.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The duel rules in this tournament are quite primitive. Players get only 2000 LP each, and any monster can be summoned right away, regardless of level (except fusions and rituals). And many card effects are exaggerated and are unrealistic or unusable/unappliable in the real game.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Legends of a giant Yeti has existed for many years from the snow mountains of Japan and they were called Yetrigar. This man-monster once laid in suspended animation encased in ice deep inside a glacial cavern in Alberta, Canada. An Arizona underground nuclear test split the earth northward which created a subterranean pipeline to Canada. The powerful tremor shattered the monster's icy prison and the seeping radiation made the Bigfoot creature grow into a massive giant. Yetrigar would head south and encounter the king of all monsters, Godzilla. <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" slug=\"shield\">SHIELD</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-33761\" href=\"/red-ronin/4005-33761/\" slug=\"red-ronin\">Red Ronin</a> would encounter a real life version of Yetrigar when it battles <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21599\" href=\"/godzilla/4005-21599/\" slug=\"godzilla\">Godzilla</a> in the Grand Canyon. A massive battle occurs between the three super-powered giants which results with Yetrigar getting buried under tons of rubble in a location called Budiansky Point.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Yetrigar was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42016\" href=\"/doug-moench/4040-42016/\" slug=\"doug-moench\">Doug Moench</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3439\" href=\"/herb-trimpe/4040-3439/\" slug=\"herb-trimpe\">Herb Trimpe</a> in 1978 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2901\" href=\"/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters/4050-2901/\" slug=\"godzilla-king-of-the-monsters\">Godzilla King of the Monsters</a> # 10.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1184790-786206_yetrigargod3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1184790\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3574144486692\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:135.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1184790-786206_yetrigargod3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1184790\"><img alt=\"Yetrigar breaks free.\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1184790-786206_yetrigargod3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1184790-786206_yetrigargod3.jpg 263w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px\" data-width=\"263\"></a><figcaption>Yetrigar breaks free.</figcaption></figure><p>Years later, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\" href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" slug=\"avengers-west-coast\">West Coast Avengers</a> return to the Grand Canyon for a vacation but they had no idea that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2497\" href=\"/mockingbird/4005-2497/\" slug=\"mockingbird\">Mockingbird</a> had her own agenda to deal with at that same location. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2497\" href=\"/mockingbird/4005-2497/\" slug=\"mockingbird\">Bobbi Morse</a> knew that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7239\" href=\"/phantom-rider/4005-7239/\" slug=\"phantom-rider\">Hamilton Slade</a>, the grandson of the original <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7239\" href=\"/phantom-rider/4005-7239/\" slug=\"phantom-rider\">Phantom Rider</a> was there because he found his grandfather's burial cave. She believed that Hamilton Slade was the Phantom Rider that assaulted her a few weeks prior and wanted revenge. During their walk down the Grand Canyon, Bobbi threw an explosive device down Budiansky Point that released Yetrigar. Mockingbird left the scene during the distraction while the rest of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\" href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" slug=\"avengers\">Avengers</a> dealt with the legendary giant. Yetrigar was eventually defeated when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\" href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" slug=\"hank-pym\">Hank Pym</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21188\" href=\"/tigra/4005-21188/\" slug=\"tigra\">Tigra</a> jumped onto his shoulders while it was being restrained by some cable-arrows from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\" href=\"/clint-barton/4005-1475/\" slug=\"clint-barton\">Hawkeye</a>. Pym then placed a small brace in Yetrigar's ear and enlarged it enough to cause the monster to black out.</p><h3>Acts of Vengeance</h3><p>Yetrigar was placed in the United States government's maximum security installation for the incarceration of super-human criminals called the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43582\" href=\"/the-vault/4020-43582/\" slug=\"the-vault\">Vault</a>. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3287\" href=\"/wizard/4005-3287/\" slug=\"wizard\">Wizard</a> would escape from his cell and take down <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10309\" href=\"/guardsman/4005-10309/\" slug=\"guardsman\">Frank Ensign</a> who was Guardsman Prime with the help of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3233\" href=\"/mr-hyde/4005-3233/\" slug=\"mr-hyde\">Mr. Hyde</a>. The Wizard reached the control panel and released numerous criminals from their cells. Hawkeye and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\" href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" slug=\"iron-man\">Iron Man</a> responded to the distress signal and managed to take down all the criminals. Hawkeye used an explosive arrow to open a door but it turned out to be part of Yetrigar's special holding cell. The two Avengers left the scene before Yetrigar could free himself. When the Vault was shut down, it was rumored that Yetrigar was relocated to Monster Isle. The current whereabouts of Yetrigar are unknown.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Yetrigar stands over 80 feet tall and is a powerful creature with superhuman strength and durability. Yetrigar is physically very tough, resistant to injury and oblivious to extraordinary amounts of pain.</p>",

    "deck": "Van Hohenheim is Edward and Alphonse Elric's father, who bears nearly the exact same appearance as the Leader of the Homunculi, Father. He is quiet and intelligent, and thus far we have little idea of the extent of his knowledge, other then the fact that he himself is a Philosopher's Stone.",
    "description": "<p><strong><em><u>Slave Number 23</u></em></strong></p><p>Van Hohenheim was born in the country of Cselksess as Slave Number 23. He became a hard worker among the slaves, and he was one of those slaves singled out to be a test subject for the creation of some alchemic project. However, do to his very low status, he was not told about what the project was for, and was sent back to his duties as a slave.</p><p>One day, as he swept up the filth of a dirty room, moving arouind the pieces of fallen debris on the ground, he heard a small voice calling to him, attemptng to make ontact with him, and for a second, he turned towards the sound. However, when he looked at the sound, he only saw a shelf, and, realizing that there was no person tere, continued on his cleaning duties.</p><p>The voice again called him, saying that he was ignoring it and that he had to come over to see the voice. Number 23 did as he was told, and looked down to see a small vial on the shelf with a small bal of black energy inside.</p><p>After seeing where the voice came from, he turned and returned to his duties saying that he would deal with the flask later. The Flask told him he should act more shocked or surprised at the talking to a strange ball of energy in a flask. However, Number 23 shrug this off, and returned to his sweeping.</p><p>Again the flask spoke up, saying how he liked that Number 23 was not easily scared and asked him his name, but when Number 23 told him his name, the flask was not happy with calling the boy a number, and again asked for his name. Number 23 then turned, and told the flask that he didn't have a name, and that he was only a slave. The flask then rattled off a definition of the word slave, only to confuse te young slave and for the flask to call him stupid.</p><p>The flask the changed its tone, and commented on how it didn't know how it came to be or why it was like what it was like. Then, suddenly, the flask said that Number 23 had to be the one who had given him his blood, and 23 confirmed this, causing the flask to say that it was Number 23 who had gven him life. Then, when the flask tried to give him gratitude, he realized that he thought just calling him 23 sounded cold, and decided to give the young slave another name.</p><p>First, the flask came up with the name Theofilatos Bombastus but this was quickly rejected ny Number 23, who said that it was way too long. Then, the flask came up with the name Von Hohenheim. The slave found this name appealing to him, and accepted it as his new name. The flask then began to tell him how to spell the name, but realized that Hoenheim could neither read nor write, and told him that he would never be able to get out of his lifestyle as a slave if he could neither read or write.</p><p>The flask then asked Hoenheim if he wished to escape from the shackles of his life, and offered him knowledge, and to teach him how to escape. Then, Hoenheim, both shocked and skeptical, asked for the flasks name. The energy in the flask then began to shift, and a grin appeared on its features as well as an eye, and he told Hohenheim to call him Homunculus, the Dwarf inside the Flask. Homun, as he was called, started to teach Hohenheim lots of things. He in turn started to teach the other slaves how to read and write. An advisor of the king caught him, so Hohenheim told him he could do some alchemy and asked him if he could be the advisors assistant. A few years later, the king of Cselksess called Homun to explain to him about immortality. </p><p>The king found men to dig huge ditches in the earth around Cselksess, which would be a transmutation circle. The same men killed a huge number of people in upper Cselkcess. Years later the ditches were done and everything was ready. The king put a drop of his blood in ash and started the process. Little black hands with three fingers on each hand and extremely long arms began to come out of the ground and everyone except Hoheheim and Homun started to die. That was because they were in the middle. Hohenheim was sucked into an enormous eye. When he woke up he saw that everyone in Cseckcess was dead. He saw Homun who looked exactly like him. It turned out that both Hohenheim and Homun were now immortal! Hohenheim left and became a wanderer, teaching himself more and more alchemy, and eventually introducing it to the country of Xing, where he ended up in. After wandering for centuries, Hohenheim met the love of his life, <a href=\"/trisha-elric/4005-70194/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70194\"> Trisha Elric</a>. He had two kids, namely <a href=\"/alphonse/4005-49317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49317\"> Alphonse</a> and <a href=\"/edward-elric/4005-45359/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45359\"> Edward Elric</a>. After a few years and a picture he would never forget, Hohenheim decided to leave since he would never age and he didn't want his kids to know. They thought he had abandoned them and soon Trisha died of grief. They, in turn, decided to try to bring her back from the dead. Meanwhile Hohenheim, feeling horrible, tried to find the Homunculi, now known as <a href=\"/father/4005-50299/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50299\"> Father</a>. </p><p>Years later Edward and Alphonse met him again and he explained his origin. They searched for Father and Hohenheim found him alone, which will ensue an incredible battle that will be revealed later.</p>",

    "deck": "Kazuki is an eleventh grade student who, after an incident with a Homunculi, lost his heart, only for a Kakugane to replace it. He then became enthralled in a war between alchemists and Homuncu",
    "description": "<p>Kazuki Muto, a student at the Ginsei Private School, one day decided to check out an abandoned factory that was in the forest behind his school. As he entered the factory, often called the Monster, he heard a noise, and turned to see a giant snake-like creature.</p><p>Horrified, he turned, and ran, hiding behind a wall, and looked carefully around the corner. As he peered around the corner, he saw a girl standing there, and she seemed oblivious to the giant, evil-looking cobra like creature. Throwing caution to the wind, Kazuki ran forward, pushing the girl out of the way as the creature struck. He felt a horrible pain in his chest as the attack struck him in the heart.</p><p>Kazuki woke with a scream, causing all of the people living in his dorms to charge into his room and asking him why he is screaming. Kazuki, who is still asleep, screams that he has died, before he began attacking his friends with karate, awaking both the boys and girls dormitory with the noise.</p><p>The next day, Kazuki went to school, where two girls commented on the events last night, to which Kazuki flinched back in shock, asking how news of his sleep-induced assault had spread so quickly, only for one of the three he had attacked, Hideyuki Okakura, to appear behind him, telling him that he had told all of the students. He then lifted up his shirt, displaying multiple bandages for everyone to see, saying how those injuries would have given it away even if he hadn’t told about the attack. Kazuki denied this was him, saying that if it was the karate he had learned it would have killed Okakura, before swiftly turning and striking a pose, saying how he instilled terror in everyone, much to the chagrin of Okakura. Okakura then told Kazuki to apologize, a command which was quickly met, and the matter was set aside between the two, just then, the other two who had been attacked came up behind Kazuki. One of them, Daihama, mentioned how the sleeping Kazuki was terrifying. The other one, Rokumasu, asked Kazuki what he the dream had been about. The friends began walking, and told them about how he had gone to the monster factory, how he had seen the girl, and how he had died saving her. The fact that he didn’t kill the dream monster shocked his friends, but this shock was quickly ignored and they continued on their way to class.</p><p>As the four students were talking, the school bell rang, and they made a mad dash for the gate, where one of their teachers, Mister Mita, was standing. Kazuki’s friends got into the gate, and Rokumasu turned, telling Kazuki that he was running too slowly. Kazuki just smiled at this comment, before striking a pose and saying how he was about to reveal his amazing dash. As he prepared to run, his sister, Mahiro, came running up, and he ran along side her, congratulating her on being late on her first day. She responded by telling him that they could still make it into the school on time, and Kazuki playfully pushed her forward. Mahiro crossed the border into the school just as the late bell rang, making her on time, but Kazuki was not so lucky, being one step away from the border. After the run, Mahiro leaned on the gate, but as she leaned, it suddenly began closing, since school had started, and she fell into the way of the closing gate. Quickly, Kazuki went to his knees, putting a hand against the automatically closing gate as he held it opened for her, and, unseen by everyone, a light in the outline of a hexagon appeared on the left side of his chest. He pushed Mahiro out of the way, and the gate continued to close as he quickly fell out of the way, receiving only a few scrapes. As Mahiro bent to see if Kazuki was alright, Mita walked up to the two, and gave both of them a point for being one second late, and reminded them that if they got three points, they would be punished. Kazuki argued that his sister was on time, but Mita insisted that she was late, so Kazuki convinced him to take give him two points, and make it so that Mahiro didn’t have any.</p><p>Looking back at the figure of Mita, Okakura commented on how stupid the guy was being, but Rokumasu told him to be quite before he was heard, and the group began to leave as Mita stared after them.</p><p>As they were about to get away from Mita, he told all of them to not move, before asking Kazuki why he did not have a school regulated backpack. Kazuki turned back towards the teacher, and told him that he could not find it that morning, so he had grabbed an old one to carry his stuff in. Mita then made a strange comment about where Kazuki went to amuse himself, but he quickly said that it did not matter. He then gave Kazuki one more point, totaling the three he needed to get a punishment. He set the punishment as pulling weeds from the school field after school, and forbid him from going home until he was finished pulling every weed. Kazuki was about to protest the punishment, but Mita stopped him, telling him that the bell was going to ring, and that, unless he wanted more points, he would get to class. Kazuki turned, defeated, and began walking to class. Unbeknownst to him, Mita stared after him as he left, with a strange look in his eye.</p><p>Later that day, at lunch, Kazuki, Okakura, Rokumasu, and Daihama discussed the punishment, Okakura noting how Mita had been acting very strange lately. Rokumasu did not agree, saying that he had always been one of the hardest teachers to get along with. As they talked, Mahiro entered the area they were having lunch in, and ran up to the three, Kazuki having gone to get drinks. After learning this from the others, Daihama complimented how she looked in her school uniform, and Kazuki came back to Mahiro doing a little dance. Mahiro then told everyone that the biggest reason she had wanted to go to the school was because of how the uniforms looked. To everyone’s shock, Kazuki then told how he had only wanted to come to the school for the uniforms as well, before turning to his sister and commenting on her good mood. He then decided to give her his drink in honor of her getting into the Ginsei School (unfortunately, he enjoys a drink that everyone hates, and she was forced to drink the horrible tasting liquid.)</p><p>Turning to the others, Kazuki told them how the area around his heart had been hurting. He then looked down at his cell phone, noticing that he had a message, but before he could see what the message was, Rokumasu, who hadn’t noticed he had a message, told him that he needed to stop fooling around, or else he would have more problems then a hurting area around the heart. Daihama then agreed, telling Kazuki that something bad could have happened, and when Kazuki mentioned that he had never thought about that, Okakura told him that he should start taking that into consideration. Kazuki justified his actions by saying that his body had moved before he could think, and that it didn’t matter anyways as long as Mahiro was safe. Again, Rokumasu spoke, telling him that, if he wasn’t careful, his dream would become a reality. Kazuki became a bit freaked out at this comment, saying that he never wanted to relive that nightmare. Before anything else could be done, the bell rang, and everyone headed of to class. Before they had gotten out of the courtyard, though, Mahiro turned to Kazuki, asking if he needed any help his punishment, but he denied the offer. Then, as he waved goodbye to Mahiro, he realized that he was still holding his cell phone, and quickly checked the text message that he had received, and became shocked at the message before him: “Please take good care of your new life.”</p><p>After school, Kazuki reported to his detention, and began pulling out the weeds in the field. He worked well into the night, but finally finishing, he began moving to report his completion. As he walked, he noted just how creepy the school was at night, and, turning his head away from the school, he saw the monster factory. As he stared at the abandoned factory, the memory of the dream, as well as the strange message he had received flashed through his mind, and he became frightened. Losing his nerve, he turned around, telling himself that he would just report his completion the next day. Before he could leave though, a voice behind him asked him where he was going, and he turned to find Mita.</p><p>Mita asked him if he had finished his work with the weeds, but then ignored his own question, saying that they had something more important to attend to, much to the confusion of Kazuki. Mita then through something to Kazuki, and he recognized his school bag. He turned back to Mita, asking him where he had found the bag, only to be told that he had found it at the old factory behind the school. Scales then began forming on Mita’s face, and with a savage look in his eye, he told Kazuki that the bag had been left the previous night by the man who had stopped him from eating his dinner the previous night.</p><p>At the shock of this statement, a hexagon-shaped light again began radiating from Kazuki’s chest, and he fell to the knees in pain. Kazuki then told himself that he was only having another dream, or else he would be dead, while at the same time grabbing a pole that lay near him. Before he could do anything with the pole, though, Mita told Kazuki that he hadn’t fully exterminated him the previous night, and that this time, he would make sure that Kazuki was good and dead. Mita’s body then began to shift and stretch, growing to the form of a large, metallic snake, just like the one that Kazuki had seen when he believed he was dreaming.</p><p>Kazuki turned and ran from the huge serpentine creature, realizing that he had not been dreaming as the creature began chasing him. As he run, his cell phone began to ring, and he answered it only for a female voice on the other end to tell him that she would be there in three minutes. He then began asking the voice who she were, what was going on, and what was going to happen to him, but before he could be answered, the monster behind him attempted t attack him, and he dodged it. After this, the voice told him that talking would only delay her, so she would keep the explanation brief.</p><p>She told Kazuki that the thing behind him was a <a href=\"/homunculus/4015-51803/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-51803\">Homunculus</a>, and that they would take on the guise of humans so that they could devour them, much to Kazuki’s horror. The voice then told him that she had accidentally pulled him into this, but before he could ask her what she meant, he heard the <a href=\"/homunculus/4015-51803/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-51803\">Homunculus</a> catching up to him, and when he told the girl that the thing was catching, up, she told him that there was only one other option, allowing him to use his power to fight the creature. This surprised Kazuki the most out of all that the girl had said, and he asked her what she meant by his power, and if she was serious and that he was really supposed to fight the <a href=\"/homunculus/4015-51803/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-51803\">Homunculus</a>. She then noted that he could not remember what had happened, and when he told her that he was getting out of there, she told him that it was useless, as the <a href=\"/homunculus/4015-51803/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-51803\">Homunculus</a> would follow him to the ends of the earth until he was dead. Kazuki then turned the corner, and saw directly in front of him his sister, Mahiro.</p><p>He quickly asked her what she was doing there, and she tells him that she came to help him, since he was taking so long. Before he can do anything else, Kazuki hears a sound, and quickly turns his head to look behind him, and then quickly ran towards the sound, telling Mahiro to run while he distracted it, but as he ran, he heard the sound of ground breaking behind him, and he turned as the snake’s jaws burst through the ground around Mahiro. Its jaws closed before she could react, and its head rose high above Kazuki, and slowly looking down at him. Its mouth then opened and in the back of its throat, a tongue made its way out. On the end of the tongue, Mita’s head rested, and it began to speak, telling Kazuki that Mahiro would make up for the meal he had lost the previous night. Before the head could say anything else, though, Kazuki lunged forward, beating it with the pipe he had picked up earlier. He began shouting that she had had nothing to do with this, and to give her back as tears slowly streamed down his face.</p><p>The half-destroyed head quickly looked up at him, telling him that it was useless before it swung forward, hitting Kazuki square in the chest. He flew backwards, hitting a tree as the monster told him that it had been created by alchemy, and therefore could be injured by nothing but alchemy. Hearing this, Kazuki remembered that the strange girl on the phone had told him he would be allowed to use his powers, and the hexagon shape again appeared over his heart. As the pain from the glow filled him, hi mind suddenly had a strange memory with the girl he had saved the preceding night.</p><p>Both Kazuki and the girl were on top of the water tower, Kazuki slumped on the ground and looking at the floor, and the girl standing before him. She asked if he could still hear her, stating that he had already lost his heart from being so rash and jumping to save her. Her voice then became less harsh as she reached into her pocket, noting that he had only done it to save her. From her right pocket she then pulled out a metal, hexagon-shaped object, calling it a Kakugane, a special object which had been created and refined by alchemists. She then leaned over, bringing the object to his chest, and it slowly phased into where his heart should be. She told him that he now had the power of a new life, as well as another power, a power that would only awaken through his will to fight. This power would then take the shape of any weapon he wished.</p><p>Back in the present time, as Kazuki was still on the ground from the snakes attack, he slowly stood up as the events from the previous night still streamed through his head. Mita’s head then looked down at him, telling him that he had already dead, and then asking him if he wanted to die and join his sister in the afterlife. Kazuki’s hand then became taut, and he bought his hand to his chest, telling the monster in front of him that he would die, as long as the creature gave him back his sister. He then shouted out the word “Buso Renkin.” The <a href=\"/homunculus/4015-51803/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-51803\">Homunculus</a> then ate him, saying that he had no time to bargain though, but it suddenly began shaking, and from the inside its stomach, Kazuki, holding Mahiro, erupted from it, Kazuki holding before him a lance, created from hid replacement heart.</p><p>As Kazuki slowly fell towards the ground, he saw before him a girl in a skirt, and she spoke calmly, telling him that the lance was a perfect mirror of his personality, as it never thought as it ripped through its enemy. She was holding a Kakugane at her legs, and she too shouted Buso Renkin, and two leg braces appeared on her thighs. Attached to each of these leg braces were two scythes. She quickly killed the creature, stabbing it through a seal that rested on its head, and then she turned to Kazuki in mid-air. She had a deep scar running from cheek to cheek. As he looked, Kazuki realized that the girl with the scar was the girl he had saved the previous night. The girl looked at Kazuki, and told him to stab the <a href=\"/homunculus/4015-51803/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-51803\">Homunculus</a> through the head in the seal, and to be careful to land, or he would die, and, looking down as he fell, he saw how high up he was.</p><p>After Kazuki and the girl had landed, he told her how he had ended up in the factory after seeing the monster go in and seeing the factory lights on. He then stuck a pose again, saying how he had rushed in to save her, as she was obviously going to die, but the girl disagreed, saying that she had only looked defenseless to lure the monster out. He then made a face, saying how he had clearly died. As he mentioned this, Mahiro, who was at that time propped up against a tree, stirred, and Kazuki ran towards her, throwing his lance down in the process. He suddenly felt weak, and fell, only to be caught by one of the scar girl’s scythes. She told him to take it easy, since Mahiro was in better shape then he was, and when he told her that knowing she was ok made him feel better, she called him strange for his unbelievable worry for others. The girls Buso Renkin then began returning to its normal state as a Kakugane, and she told him that what he had was bravery, and a very reckless bravery at that. She then turned to him ad smiled, telling him that she didn’t care about that though, and that she at least liked him a bit, causing Kazuki to blush.</p><p>The girl then lifted up Kazuki’s lance, handing it back to him, and telling him to be careful with it, as it was his heart, his new life, and that he would die if it was every destroyed or taken away from him. He then lifted up the lance in front of him, before turning to the girl, and asking her what alchemy. She told him it was in the dictionary, and then began to tell him what alchemy really was as the night went on.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Rose (Angel) Rivera is one of the newer characters in \"Locas.\" She is a young Mexican-American woman from Tarzana, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles. Her father, Angel Rivera, runs a construction company, and since he and his daughter are so much alike most people call Rose Angel as well.</p><p>Angel is a student at Valley College. Her major is unknown, but she devotes a great deal of her time and energy at school to athletics. She plays softball, and she is also on the Valley College swim, wrestling, and gymnastics teams. Angel is a natural athlete who loves sports, but she finds the petty politics and jealousies of team sports frustrating. As an athlete, Angel often suffers from bad luck; her faulty dismount from a balance bar keeps Valley College out ot the state gymnastics championships.</p><p>Angel is an attractive girl with long brown hair. She dresses casually, in low-cut tops, athletic jackets, and long pants. She is very strong, and can carry a large man like Ray Dominguez some distance one-handed.</p><p>Angel has an open, amiable personality, and gets along with practically everybody. She is somewhat naive, especially about sex. Angel appears to be heterosexual. When Vivian Solis (the Frogmouth) hits on her, Angel at first does not even realize what Vivian is doing. Though often unlucky and baffled by the complexities of the world, Angel is fundamentally optimistic and never discouraged for long.</p><p>Angel comes to know Maggie Chascarillo and spends some time around the Capri, the apartment complex Maggie manages. Through Maggie, Angel meets Ray, Vivian, and Hopey Glass. In the recent 'Ti-Girls' series, Angel also becomes friends with Alarma, the mysterious seven-foot Russian giantess who lives at the Capri. In 'Ti-Girls,' Alarma is a superheroine and a member of a superheroine group known as the Feenomenons. Angel becomes an apprentice superheroine under Alarma's tutelage, assuming the name 'Boot Angel.' Angel has no super powers, so it is not easy for her to keep up with Alarma. Alarma is also abrasive and arrogant, but after many ups and downs she and Angel form an effective team.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In the late 1600's Manfred Wicker lived in what was known as the Monastery of the Capuchins.  Out of all his brothers, Manfred was the example of the monastery followers, he was perfect in so many different ways.  Manfred's downfall was he be proud of how he was, and it was his pride that was his greatest sin.  The sin lead Manfred in to a trap, a trap set by the one that got enjoyment of his sin, Lucifer.  When Manfred asked to be saved Lucifer showed him how sin can be the road to all salvation, and that by indulging in every vice he can come more humbly into the sight of God.  Manfred and the Capuchins put there new creed into practice, by tormenting, beating, raping, and killing nuns.<br /></p><p>Shortly after the new creed that Manfred had set up, he found the first signs of a plague on his body.  In fear and desperation Manfred pledge his soul to hell for a chance to live.  Satan responded by giving him 300 years where Manfred could not die or be harmed. The monastery thrived as the Kingdom of Sin, but Gods wrath would soon put an end to it.  The river Dess burst its banksm tore through the hillside, and fell upon the the tainted monastery.  The evil monks drowned, but due to the agreement with the Devil Manfred made, all he could do was watch all of them die.</p><p>Manfred spent years traveling around the world trying to come up with a way to increase his life so he would not have to suffer in Hell, when his 300 years are up.  About the year 1760 Manfred traveled to the \"New World\", and made his way in to Gotham.  There he built Gotham Cathedral, with Gothic designs that would entrap souls and spirits.  Manfred also spent the time perfecting a chemical that he could dispense across a wide area, and the chemical would spread by the wind.</p><p>Bruce Wayne's first encounter with Manfred was at the private school he attended as a child. Bruce new him as Mr. Winchester, and his experiences with him was what Bruce considered to be hell.  Bruce was beating numerous times in class and Bruce would run away from class.  Bruce's friend from school disappeared and Bruce swore that Mr. Winchester had killed him.</p><p>Manfred took the name Mr. Whisper, and left notes to Gotham city's mob bosses. The notes designated which day Mr. Whisper would kill them.  This was all part of Mr. Whipper's plan to cheat his own death by making sacrifices to the evil and innocent to the devil, in hope of an extension of his 300 years.  The mob bosses used an upside down Bat-Signal to alert Batman of what was happening. </p><p>Batman was able to foil Mr. Whisper's plan, and the Devil took Mr. Whisper to hell.  A few days afterwards a package arrived for Batman, it contained the beating heart of Mr. Whisper.  Batman traveled to Bolivia and threw the heart in the bottom of lake Dess.</p>",

    "description": "<br/>Alarma Kraktovilova is one of the stranger characters in the most recent chapters of LOCAS. She is a massive young woman who lives with her mother in the Capri Apartments in the San Fernando Valley, the apartment complex managed by Maggie Chascarrillo.  <br/> <br/>Little is known for certain about Alarma, but her behavior is very odd. Maggie spies on her, and on several occasions she has seen Alarma come home in the dead of night clad in a superheroine costume. Alarma does at least one good deed on these mysterious journeys, returning a strayed cat to one of the Capri's residents. <br/> <br/>Alarma is enormous--well over seven feet tall--and terrifically strong. She can leap from the roof of the Capri and land on her feet, and she has no difficulty tying up Izzy Ortiz during one of Izzy's worst fits of insanity.  She is usually quiet, but her personality is rather abrasive.<br/> <br/>Alarma is very attractive, a fact which Hopey Glass (of course) notices immediately. She wears glasses most of the time, and her long, straight hair is probably an orange-red color. Alarma has one further physical peculiarity: several of her upper front teeth are fang-shaped. <br/> <br/>Alarma is a principal character in Jaime Hernandez' recent \"Ti Girls\" story.  In this, Alarma is revealed as a member of the Feenomenons or Feenoms, a crack team of young superheroines. (Alarma's mother was also a superheroine in Soviet days, Pravda the Red Truth.) Alarma becomes close with Maggie's young friend, Angel Rivera, who also aspires to be a superheroine. Alarma and Angel have many adventures together, but the \"reality\" of \"Ti Girls\" is uncertain; the whole story may be a dream sequence in Angel's head, Maggie's head, or both.",

    "description": "<p>Zordon is a interdimensional being trapped in a time warp by <a href=\"/rita-repulsa/4005-39640/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-39640\"> Rita Repulsa</a>. Zordon protects the Rangers and informs the Rangers on several monsters and villains out there. The Rangers become closer to one another forming a close bond with each other and especially Zordon. To some Zordon is a like a father figure.</p><p>Keeping a close eye on Rita, Zordon knew that once she had escaped that she would attempt to destroy <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\"> Earth</a>. As a result Zordon told Alpha to summon five teenagers that are over bearing, overemotional, with an attitude. Zordon choose Kimberly, Trini, Billy, Jason, and Zack which would later become the first Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. But it wasn't up until they had won the fight against Rita that they were officially Power Rangers. The Power Rangers had three rules to follow:</p><ol><li>They must never tell anybody that they are Power Rangers</li><li>Never use your power for personal gain </li><li>Never escalate a fight unless Rita forces you to</li></ol><p>Rita being determined to destroy Zordon creates a Green Power Ranger. She sends him to destroy the Command Center. Zordon knowing whats about to happen tells Alpha 5 to recharge up until the point the Green Power Ranger comes to the Command Center.</p><p>Zordon realized that Rita was using a Ranger to stop the Power Rangers, but he ended up disconnected from this dimension by the Green Ranger. Alpha 5 and Billy tried various ways to bring Zordon back but every attempt failed. Zordon would try to warn the Rangers about the Green Ranger but he would disappear. When Alpha 5 was finally able to bring back Zordon, Zordon informed the Rangers about the Green Power Ranger and told them in order to return Tommy(green ranger) back to normal they must destroy the Sword of Darkness. Only then will Tommy become good again.</p><p>Zordon already knew that he would return Tommy back to good and with an open welcome Zordon lets Tommy join the Power Rangers. Tommy will soon give up his power coin to Jason because he never wants Rita to gain control of the power. This would now make the Rangers a 5 member team again.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Gravel, also known as Sergeant Major William Gravel is a British SAS soldier and one of the best at that. Due to some shady activity though (namely, taking numerous unsanctioned jobs for cash) he has earned the punishment of working as a \"K\" agent on deniable operations. He could leave if he wanted to but he knows that would only lead to the British government trying to kill him, so he does his job, but not happily. He serves as a constant annoyance to his superior officers which leads to them putting him on more and more dangerous missions. He also continues to take black market jobs not only to make money, but to buy friends and favors for when the day comes that his people start coming for him. Aside from his military involvement, William Gravel is best known for being a combat magician. At one point in time he was one of 8, but presently, he is the only one around. Not much is known about the magical side of Gravel's past other than that he's been a practicing combat magician for about 20 years.</p><h2>Character Evolution </h2><p><strong>Strange Kiss</strong></p><p>In Strange Kiss, William Gravel's only friend in the world, a man named <a href=\"/bull/4005-85415/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85415\">Bull</a>, was killed. It wasn't by normal means though, and that was why Gravel got involved. He met up with Bull in a hospital right before hundreds of lizards exploded painfully out of him, and from there things just got worse. It took a lot of killing, but Gravel eventually learned that the lizards were the children of an enormous being from another realm that was nearing death. He was the last of his kind so he had been impregnating people in order to start a new generation before he died. But, as a favor to Bull (who had begged Gravel to avenge him right as he died), Gravel had killed all of his children. After having killed his way to the <a href=\"/lizard/4005-85418/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85418\">Lizard</a>, a creature as old as the solar system, Gravel regretted having to do what he would have to. He didn't want to kill the creature, but he had promised Bull he would, so he had to.</p><h4><strong>Stranger Kisses</strong></h4><p>Gravel next showed up in LA, this time taking a job from a washed up actor. The man, John Weston, had a plan to catch some snuff film-makers in the act of selling their product, turn them in publicly to the police, regain his lost fame, and become mayor of Los Angeles. William's job was to act as his bodyguard so he wouldn't get killed if anything went wrong when the cops got there. Gravel accepted the job and the next day they met up for the bust. Things went wrong when the videos turned out to be something other than what Mr. Weston expected, something unnatural. Weston freaked out and began shooting a gun no one knew he had and wound up getting killed. Meanwhile, Gravel had snatched the tape and gotten away, threatening to show it to important people if he got any trouble. Of course, he got trouble. The movie maker/thugs chased Gravel and ended up taking him to the place where the films were made. Gravel found himself cornered in the warehouse with the unfortunate men and women that starred in the movies, while the thugs and a number of corrupt cops were outside trying to find a way in. Things escalated when the cops started shooting and crashed their way into the building, but Gravel used some magic to escape unharmed and with all the evidence needed to get a lot of people in trouble.</p><h4><strong>Strange Killings</strong></h4><p>Some time later, Gravel returned to Britain and was given a real mission. A prison had been taken over by supernatural forces of some kind and he was the only one capable of stopping it. He was sent in alone and discovered that a single inmate had magically taken control of the prison, killing everything in the surrounding area and turning the guards and other prisoners into zombies. Gravel, armed with his normal two handguns, a pair of assault rifles, and his magic, slaughtered everything that moved once he gets inside and worked his way to the prisoner in charge. By killing all the zombies, which were functioning basically as batteries for the spell doing all the damage, Gravel was able to stop everything that was going on. After killing the last inmate, Gravel left the prison and went outside to see his commanding officer. Gravel told him that the threat might not be completely gone, but the officer wouldn't hear it. To make sure things went as he wanted, Gravel claimed the man was a zombie and killed him in front of all his troops before going on his way.</p><h4><strong>Strange Killings: The Body Orchard</strong></h4><h4><strong>Strange Killings: Strong Medicine</strong></h4><h4><strong>Strange Killings: Necromancer</strong></h4><h4><strong>Gravel</strong></h4><h2>Powers</h2><p>Exactly what a \"combat magician\" is and can do is vague, but through his different books Gravel has done a number of \"tricks\".</p><p>Illusions: One of Gravel's most common tricks is making people see and hear him when he’s no longer there. He usually does this to get people to look one way while he goes elsewhere<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/stranger_kisses_2_p04.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a>, or in the middle of fights to get people to kill their own allies or just not pay attention to him<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/strange_killings_3_p14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a>. The illusions don't just make it look like things are there when they aren't, they can also make things look like things are gone when they're right in front of a persons face. His illusions are so good he once made another magician think he was slitting his [Gravel’s] throat when really he was cutting his own without realizing it<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-The_Body_Orchar-1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a><a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-The_Body_Orchar-2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a>. If his illusions are normal illusions or something else is unclear. He once killed a man outside his house while at the same time being in the basement of his house setting off bombs. Either one was an illusion plus some telekinesis, or he was actually in two places at once.</p><p>Bullet control: Possibly a use of his telekinesis but the control is so much more fine that it might be its own trick. Gravel makes his bullets go wherever he wants, even places he can’t see. It takes a little concentration, enough so that he doesn’t do it all the time, but so little that it’s easy for him to do it at a moments notice. (Some examples of it: He has shot multiple bullets that went through walls and found enemies as they ran around<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/stranger_kisses_3_p14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a>, has shot a single bullet into the path of a firing squad and had his bullet block every bullet fired by the enemies<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-The_Body_Orchard_3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[6]</a>, has had a gun fired at him and made the bullet fly back through the head of the shooter and then go on to kill all his friends<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Image012.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[7]</a><a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Image013.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[8]</a>.)</p><p>Reflexes: Gravel dodges bullets at close range, can do his magic tricks in the time between a gun is fired and when the bullet hits, and has even dodged bullets while holding another person and making sure they don’t get shot.</p><p>Telekinesis: Used to kill people (blow their brains out<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-The_Body_Orchar-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[9]</a><a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-The_Body_Orchar-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[10]</a><a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-The_Body_Orchar-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[11]</a>, other horrific things), break locks, blow stuff up, fire weapons independently of his body<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-The_Body_Orchard_6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[12]</a>, move objects etc.</p><p>Wall running: Gravel can walk on any surface whether its solid or not (he can run up hanging fabric<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-The_Body_Orchar-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[13]</a>) and whether it’s horizontal, vertical or even upside down.</p><p>Teleport: Gravel can teleport normally<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Stranger_Killings-The_Body_Orcha-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[14]</a> (even into moving vehicles like jets) as well as into the Body Orchard dimension which is basically an environment that grows weapons, so it's the perfect place for him to get armed quickly<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Image024.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[15]</a> and also cover very large distances in a very short time<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Image003.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[16]</a>. (He can’t go to the Body Orchard when injured because the strain on his physical body would increase any damage already present.) He can also teleport things remotely but has only shown this with small objects<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Image005.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[17]</a>.</p><p>Phasing: Gravel can phase through other matter at a moments notice.</p><p>Pyrokinesis: Used for lighting his smokes mostly but he can light other things on fire as he wishes<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Image011-1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[18]</a>.</p><p>Memory erasing: Sort of like hypnotizing someone, Gravel can make people forget he even exists as well as all the time they were with him<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Image010.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[19]</a>. He can be selective with what he erases if he wants. People are left in a daze afterwards.</p><p>Strength: He’s naturally stronger than a normal human, but not superhuman. He's easily capable of punching through walls and breaking people's bodies<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-Strong_Medicine_2_.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[20]</a>.</p><p>Levitation: Gravel can walk over water<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Strange_Killings-The_Body_Orchard_1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[21]</a> as well as jump much higher than a normal person and stay in the air longer.</p><p>Psychic/Divination: William is able to know things through some form of ESP.</p><p>Durability/Strength: William can temporarily increase his strength and durability to undefined levels. (He once ran through multiple walls of a building without slowing down<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Stranger_Killings-The_Body_Orchard_.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[22]</a><a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Stranger_Killings-The_Body_Orcha-1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[23]</a><a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Stranger_Killings-The_Body_Orcha-2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[24]</a><a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Stranger_Killings-The_Body_Orcha-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[25]</a>.)</p><p>Invisibility: Gravel can make himself and others he is in physical contact with invisible<a href=\"http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg84/CVCitations/Gravel/Image011.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">[26]</a>.</p><p>Artifacts: Gravel carries and uses artifacts that allow him to do things he may not be able to do on his own. For example, he can use his lighter to make solid things intangible, he has used a special stick to teleport large objects into the Body Orchard, he carries around a substance that can empower his guns to kill god-like beings, potions that can heal him, etc.</p><p>Magic Guns: Gravel can turn normal objects (beer bottles, other guns) into magical guns with a touch. These guns are capable of being used normally (their bullets are much more destructive than normal though) but can also kill magical creatures.</p><p>Magical Horses: In his search for the pieces of the Sigsand manuscript Gravel stole another magicians magical horses (and killed her with them). He is able to summon them from a mystic stable with a clap.</p><p>Other Skills: Not all of Gravel's abilities are from magic. As a trained soldier of the SAS, Gravel is a skilled fighter both armed and unarmed. His usual weapons are guns, knives and his own body. Gravel is also a fairly skilled occult detective.</p><h2>Creators</h2><p>Gravel was created by Mike Wolfer and Warren Ellis in 1999. Each has their own take on the character.</p><p><strong>Ellis says:</strong></p><blockquote>\"William Gravel is a soldier in the British SAS, the crack Special Air Service,\" Ellis said. \"He is also a Combat Magician: a student of magic as it applies to the art of war. This has been something of a plague on his professional life. He also has a tendency to moonlight, taking on illegal security work and the like for extra beer money. Because soldiers aren't paid very well, and Bill Gravel likes a bit of extra cash in his pocket. That's how you define William Gravel: he's not a big spooky look-at-me magician, and he's not a gung-ho soldier. He's just a bloke who wants a bit of extra folding in his pocket and who wants to be left alone to enjoy it. That's all. He's a very simple man. It's a shame that it's not a very simple world.\"</blockquote><p>Wolfer says:</p><blockquote>\"First, dispose of everything you know of comic book anti-heroes, their weaknesses, their angst, their personal codes of morality and their inner demons,\" Wolfer said. \"This isn't that book. Now: Picture the hardest bastard you can imagine, a man who wants nothing more than to be left alone in a world that seems to be eternally dragging him into the hell of its political and societal woes. William Gravel is a Combat Magician. But this is not the fuzzy, wand-waving, broomstick-riding kind of magic. It's brutal, it's bloody and it springs from the blackest pit of the occult ever conceived.\"</blockquote>",

He planned to take his son (his wife died in child-birth), Robert, in his spacecraft to orbit the moon until the war had passed. However, he as rejected a loan for his poject. He instead used radio waves to find a colony in outer space. He found the race of Eternals, living on Uranus. They were an off-shoot of humanity who had left earth thousands of years ago. Living in a Kree omni-dome to protect them from Uranus' harsh conditions, they gave Horace the knowledge needed to build a space craftcapable of takinghim that far.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When his son was grown up,he left for earth with the blessing of his father to fight crime under the name 'Marvel Boy'. Three years later, Marvel Boy recieved a message from Uranus seeking urgent help. Once again refused a loan, it took him sometime to gather up the funding fo the journey. When he reached Uranus, Horace was dead, along with the other Eternals. it turned out that they had been living with a group of rouge eternals, banished from Earth thousands of years ago. They had been using Horace as a means of finding out what had transpired on Earth whilst they were gone.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Thomas was a horrible single father in his life. He blamed John Constantine for causing the death of his wife and John's Mother. The reality of the situation was that it was Thomas' primitive abortion (metal coat-hanger) that lead to the death of John's mother and twin brother. Thomas doesn't blame John for the death of the unnamed twin, since Thomas did not want both the boys. The death of the mother hung over John Constantine growing up like the coat-hanger he could could not reach until his teenage, where John ran away from Thomas' house hold many times.</p><p>Thomas was also a pervert and has gone to jail for stealing neighbors panties. Thomas was never really there to raise John and his sister <a href=\"/cheryl-masters/4005-3333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3333\">Cheryl Constantine (Masters)</a>. Both siblings were raised in an abusive house. John Constantine would find the Occult to ease the abuse inflicted by Thomas.</p><p>Thomas would die by the hands of \"<a href=\"/the-family-man/4005-28834/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28834\">The Family Man</a>\".</p><p>Although his son, <a href=\"/john-constantine/4005-3329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3329\">John Constantine</a>, exorcised Thomas Constantine's soul is issue #100, Thomas is still that decaying tortured soul which was caused by young Constantine.</p><p>The most recent time we see Thomas in Hellblazer is similar to the last time Gemma saw him, which was his burial. The church setting Thomas was exorcised in seems to reassemble the same church John Constantine married <a href=\"/epiphany-greaves/4005-70176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70176\">Epiphany Greaves</a>, in <a href=\"/hellblazer/4050-4008/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4008\">Hellblazer</a> #275.</p>",

She rose to police status and was partnered with humanoid robot - <a href=\"/greta/4005-56450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56450\">Greta</a>. They were investigating series of abductions. The clues lead to <a href=\"/crucifer/4005-60446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60446\">Crucifer</a>'s workers. As head investigator of the human crimes division, she is also handed a case of Fugitive 818. She first notices that his eyes are color of hazel, but such eye color isn't in production. Alia seeks information from a vampire, who tells that Fugitive 818, appears to be authentic human from earth, at first Alia doesn't believe that story. She learns that the man was captured by black market traders and put into death match in the coliseum, there Alia and Greta capture <a href=\"/bruno-karloff/4005-56451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56451\">Bruno</a>. They receive orders to take a shortcut through Dead Land, but they don't know that they are supposed to die there. Their camp is attacked by Ginbats, Bruno instead of escaping saves Alia's life. When back on route to new Rome, Alia starts to suspect that they were set up in Dead Lands. She decides to release Bruno, but is attacked by her partner, who can't deviate from orders. Crucifer manipulates police chief to change orders and lets Greta transport both Alia and Bruno to his lab. Seeing that Alia is being hurt, Greta acts on her programming to protect her partner; she liberates Alia from a pod. They fight their way to freedom, and in some point Greta even goes against her programming. They meet up with Bruno, who is ready to return to earth.

Having been believed to be dead already, Devin's obscurity allowed her to survive. Following <a href=\"/wildstorm-armageddon/4045-55865/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55865\">Armageddon</a>, survival of the Coda required Devin to take in more members, even less qualified ones who merely sought the safety the sisterhood could provide. Women became warriors, while men were kept only for breeding purposes if they showed potential.</p><p>Devin's forces eventually came across the members of <a href=\"/gen-13/4060-40400/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40400\">Gen 13</a> and launched a surprise attack where they captured <a href=\"/freefall/4005-23472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23472\">Freefall</a>, <a href=\"/rainmaker/4005-23473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23473\">Rainmaker</a>, and <a href=\"/caitlin-fairchild/4005-23578/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23578\">Caitlin Fairchild</a>. <a href=\"/burnout/4005-23474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23474\">Burnout</a> and <a href=\"/grunge/4005-23471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23471\">Grunge</a> managed to escape thanks to the former playing possum. Together with a time-displaced Caitlin from the past however, the boys assaulted the Codatown headquarters to rescue their friends. Devin and her forces proved to be a formidable obstacle for Gen 13, but once the entire team had reunited the young meta-humans proved to be more powerful than the Coda could handle. Unwilling to allow her kingdom to be destroyed, Devin offered to negotiate. The past Caitlin demanded that Gen 13 and any other prisoners be released from the Coda, and that the Coda would swear not to pursue Gen 13 afterwards. Begrudgingly, Devin accepted the terms, but warned Gen 13 not to cross her path again.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Devlin Trask is the son of a fallen angel named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82673\" href=\"/rachel/4005-82673/\" slug=\"rachel\">Rachel</a> and the demon lord <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59854\" href=\"/bliale/4005-59854/\" slug=\"bliale\">B'liale</a>. This gave Devlin demonic powers but no angelic powers causing him great pain whenever he used the evil power since angel and demon blood do not mix well.</p><p>To combat this, he sought the Scepter of Amazonia, an object he believed could rid him of his angelic side. When he finally obtained it, it nearly killed him. He then tried to use the Necronomicon, a demonic book, for the same goal. He was convinced by his mother and the fallen angel <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8247\" href=\"/avengelyne/4005-8247/\" slug=\"avengelyne\">Avengelyne</a> that there was no 'cure' for his ailment and he agreed to not use his demonic powers.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Possessed</h3><p>He became involved in an attempt of the evil sorcerer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59862\" href=\"/taliesen/4005-59862/\" slug=\"taliesen\">Taliesen</a> to become all-powerful by obtaining the Seven Talismans of the Circle. Devlin had dealt with the sorcerer before, having stolen his spell book. He teamed up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8248\" href=\"/peter-clifton/4005-8248/\" slug=\"peter-clifton\">Father Peter Clifton</a> to help their friend Avengelyne, who had been possessed by the sorcerer. In an unlikely turn of events, they teamed up with the crime boss <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59861\" href=\"/crymelord/4005-59861/\" slug=\"crymelord\">Crymelord</a> and his father to combat Avengelyne. With Devlin's help, the spell book gave them the ability to protect themselves from her evil magic.</p><h3>Armageddon</h3><p>When the war of Armageddon broke out between the angels and the rebel angel <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15132\" href=\"/micah/4005-15132/\" slug=\"micah\">Micah</a>, Devlin was believed long dead. He resurfaced at the battle of Megiddo and faced the evil general of Micah who was only known as Death. But Devlin knew the truth - that Death was really <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59855\" href=\"/magog/4005-59855/\" slug=\"magog\">Magog</a> - and used the full extent of his demonic powers in an attempt to kill Magog. His sacrifice was in vain as Magog was unharmed by the explosion.</p><p><b>Note</b>: Armageddon appears to be the end of the story of Avengelyne and if canon, happens after future stories.</p><h3>Operation: Hellstrike</h3><p>Devlin's father, as his human alias, contracted an agreement with the US government to supply demon blood to create new super soldiers and offered Devlin to lead them. The team would become <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58902\" href=\"/operation-hellstrike/4060-58902/\" slug=\"operation-hellstrike\">Operation: Hellstrike</a> and used to combat supernatural threats. After the disbanding of the team, Devlin disappeared, only to be found again later by the government and given another position that would utilize his supernatural talents.</p>",

    "deck": "A Weequay Jedi Knight skilled in lightsaber combat who fought in the battle of Geonosis. He later fell to the Dark Side and killed Oppo Rancisis.",
    "description": "<p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> Sora Bulq was born into the Bulq family, a wealthy merchant clan which owned most of Ruul, Weequay’s moon homeworld. Before being taken in by the Jedi Order as an infant Bulq spent time on Sriluur and Ruul. Bulq was contemplative and philosophical. Master Yoda recalled Bulq as emotionally balanced and strong in the Force. Bulq lacked a great connection to his Weequay heritage, he rejected the use of Quay totems to interpret the will of the god Quay. He believed his species held Jedi potential but they were limited by the cultural dependencies. Bulq wasn’t well-loved on Sriluur due to his rejection of the Quay religion.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq became a Jedi Master and recorded some of his thoughts in the holocrons to preserve them. He was skilled with a lightsaber talent that put him among the most skilled in Jedi history, causing him to be among the very few on the level of Mace Windu. Bulq developed total mastery over all lightsaber forms. His preferred style was the use of a lightsaber and shoto, in the utilization of the Jar’Kai dual-saber style. Bulq became an instructor in lightsaber combat and trained great many students over the years. Mira was one of his Padawans, however, he wasn’t a lightsaber virtuoso. </p><p> </p><p>   Windu choose him as his partner in developing and refining Vaapad, a dangerous and deadly perfection of the unfinished Juyo form. Bulq frequently sparred with Windu, but what Windu didn’t realize was that Vaapad had a profound effect on Bulq, who harbored a secret fascination with the dark side of the Force. Bulq began his private exploration of Vaapad growing more attracted to the darkness. </p><p> </p><p>   This affected Bulq's teaching methods. After Quinlan Vos lost his memory Bulq was entrusted with his retraining. </p><p> </p><p>   Despite Vos's own struggle with the dark side Bulq introduced him to some elements of Vaapad. It was unclear if Bulq was telling the truth, or if it had been a deliberate ploy by to lead Vos down the dark path.</p><p> </p><p>   Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi was captured by Separatist leader Count Dooku on planet Geonosis 22 BBY. Before being captured Kenobi transmitted this information to the Jedi Council. In Windu's team dispatched to rescue Kenobi, Bulq was tapped to serve. Bulq and his Padawan Galdos Stouff were among those who infiltrated the execution arena. </p><p> </p><p>   Dooku deployed a battle droid ambush and Bulq fought to be one of the survivors, though Stouff perished. The new clone army swept into the arena aboard LAAT transports and the Jedi were evacuated. The Jedi turned to engage the Separatist armies outside the arena, but Bulq never joined the battle, his evacuation gunship was shot down nearly killing him.</p><p> </p><p>   Jedi Master Tholme recruited his friend Bulq, into a pursuit of Dooku to Bakura, where he had a base. Bulq didn’t prove to be match for Dooku that Tholme had hoped for. After the Count of Serenno defeated Tholme, Dooku levitated Bulq away. </p><p> </p><p>   Bulq lost faith in the Republic over years of watching it fall into corruption and self-interest, Dooku convinced him that the galaxy could only be ruled properly by the Jedi. He also taught Bulq that his anger was a fundamental part of him, turning him fully to the dark side. Dooku allowed Bulq to rescue Tholme bringing him back to Coruscant. The rescue built Bulq's credibility which would be useful in his new assignment. </p><p> </p><p>   Three months after the Battle of Geonosis, Bulq resurfaced calling several dissident Jedi to his old family estate on Ruul. Sian Jeisel, K’Kruhk, Rhad Tarn, and Bulq's own former Padawan Mira, were among the dissidents. These four were leaders of different antiwar schools of thought claiming to speak for all dissident Jedi. Bulq's sudden reappearance as a dissident leader was unsettling to the Council, whose prestige and influence could sway even more away from the war effort. </p><p> </p><p>   Windu was sent to Ruul unaware that the entire series of developments was a plot by Dooku. Asajj Ventress, Dooku's Dark Jedi assassin, was waiting for the summit's dissident Jedi; Dooku and Bulq's intention for Ventress was to assassinate one or more of the dissident Jedi to lay the blame on Windu. With that accomplished, the Jedi's credibility would plummet.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq spoke told Windu that he had disappeared after Geonosis because of his grief at that battle's slaughter and the corrupt Republic was worthy of that sacrifice.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq was victim to a staged ambush by Ventress on a supposed meditative walk around the estate, for the purposes of authenticity. Mira was the only one to sense something wrong and set out to investigate. She entered the fray to aid her Master but she was no match for Ventress. When Windu arrived Ventress acted as if she were his subordinate and disappeared. Bulq ordered the three remaining dissidents to support Windu in combat.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq expressed his remorse at her death suggesting that it had not been in his plans. Windu interrupted him after he found Ventress's ship on the grounds. Windu deduced that Bulq must have been working with the assassin and confronted Bulq, who admitted his fall to the dark side. Bulq intended to kill Windu, the pair dueled, with Bulq confident he could defeat Windu. Ventress attacked the other three Jedi, goading the Tarn to the dark side and causing him to attack Jeisel. Bulq and Windu sensed this, Bulq taunted Windu that, with their deaths, he could not possibly win. Windu blasted Bulq into a pile of rubble and rendering him unconscious, then rushed to the other Jedi, where he forced Ventress to flee.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq's plan foiled and Jeisel and K'Kruhk returned to the Jedi fold, nullifying any chance of schism.</p><p> </p><p>   When Bulq returned to Dooku's side he became one of Dooku's most trusted subordinates, and swapped the blue crystals out of his lightsaber and shoto in favor of red ones to signal his dark side affiliation. Bulq commanded Dooku's personal Dark Jedi followers, the Dark Acolytes, among them there was Tol Skorr and Kadrian Sey. Bulq gained Dooku's complete confidence and even as a darksider he continued wearing Jedi-style robes.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq's name was among those Dark Jedi most frequently cited as examples of corruption striking the Jedi. Windu felt guilt for exposing Bulq to Vaapad but blame for his fall firmly on Bulq himself.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq participated in the boarding of the  Acclamator -class assault ship, he and Dooku took captive several Jedi, including Jeisel. Tsui Choi and Kai Justiss were present too but Dooku spared their lives. Bulq questioned why Dooku let an enemy go free. Bulq learned with Dooku's answer that even mercy could be a weapon.</p><p> </p><p>   Around the  Acclamator -class assault ship time Quinlan Vos joined the ranks of the Dark Acolytes, Bulq attested that Vos had a significant darkness within him, as he had discovered in his Vaapad test. In fact Vos was spying for the Order but Dooku was aware of this. Vos was accepted and trained with Bulq and Dooku. When it came time, Dooku took possession of Tibrin along with Vos, Bulq, Skorr, and Sey executing its former strongman leader, Suribran Tu. Bulq was placed in command of the interim government, systematically exterminating all Tu's associates.</p><p> </p><p>   One year and four months into the war, former Suprme Chancellor Finis Valorum, was fomenting dissent against Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Through the Separatist agent Senator Viento, Bulq contracted Sajé Tasha to carry out the assassination of Valorum.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq was placed in command to raise and train a clone army of Morgukai warriors. An elite Nikto warrior cult whom the Jedi thought was slain years ago by Asyla Secura. Bulq and Dooku guaranteed the return and the command of the Morgukai to Bok, if he could provide the genetic material. Bulq recruited almost all of the Anzati master assassins to train the clones. Vos only knew that something big was in the works. </p><p> </p><p>   Vos returned to the Republic and revealed to the Jedi Council that Bulq had a mysterious project under his command which involved frequent visits to Anzat. </p><p> </p><p>   Tholme and Secura track Bulq to Saleucami where he was preparing to move the army offworld. Tholme transmitted the information about the facility to Secura before Bulq attacked him. The Jedi Master attempted to talk Bulq, instead, he revealed his corruption and deception on Bakura. Bulq attacked furiously and Tholme surprised him with an assault of glass shards to disappear. Tholme was a master of stealth and vanished into the vast cave system, where he began sabotaging the facilities. Bulq accepted that the sabotage would keep the army from being deployed and ordered that the equipment be moved deeper into the caverns, to be shielded from orbital bombardment and prepared for a Republic ground assault. </p><p> </p><p>   The Republic's strike force arrived under the orders of Jedi Master Oppo Rancisis and found Bulq entrenched in the caldera city, protected by a geothermal-powered theater shield and planetary ion cannon. The ion cannon held the small fleet commanded by Captain Sagoro Autem. After five months of siege a chance explosion in battle revealed an underground tunnel, which Vos used to destroy one of the perimeter shield generators and gain the Republic access into the caldera city. Tholme continued sabotaging Bulq's operations and escaping every attempt to capture or kill him.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq maintained Vos as a double agent hoping to find Rancisis's battle plans but the Jedi Master was dependent upon his battle meditation sharing his plans with no one. </p><p> </p><p>   Bulq summoned Vos, who was a triple agent, hid his spying for the Confederacy from the Jedi but still intended to find and slay the second Sith Lord, whom he had become convinced was Bulq. Dooku and Bulq were aware of this and still felt that they could manipulate Vos to their advantage. During the meeting Vos was charged with hunting down and eliminating Tholme.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq’s troops initiated a diversionary attack causing Rancisis to go into battle meditation keeping him occupied. The Anzati assassins sneaked into the Jedi member's chambers and attempt to assassinate him. Rancisis vanquished the Anzati but Bulq was able to move behind and and plunged his lightsaber into the Jedi Master.</p><p> </p><p>   Vos athought he succeeded in his mission and returned to the Republic's camp. Vos and Secura as slipped inside the tunnel network to plant charges on the main shield generator, while a diversionary battle covered them. Vos abandoned Secura selling her out to Bulq, however, Bok was sent to investigate Vos's report of her position. Vos felt he had handed victory to Bulq. By hologram, Bulq and Dooku arranged a final test: Vos must kill Khalen Hentz, his lover. Vos refused claiming himself as a Jedi and Bok revealing that the position of Secura was false.</p><p> </p><p>   Bulq prepared for a showdown to drive Vos to the dark side for good. Tholme revealed himself once more and intervened on Vos's side, Bulq lost his shoto and furiously battled Tholme, whose continued sabotage had become a powerful irritant. Vos killed his opponent, Skorr, in time to block Bulq's killing strike over Tholme, who was vulnerable on the floor by a wounded in the leg. With Dooku's aid Bulq turned to dueling Vos attempting to drive him to the dark side and against Tholme.</p><p> </p><p>   With Secura and Tholme's mental support Vos confronted his own darkness, as Vos knelt, Bulq rushed in behind him for the killing strike. Vos conquered his inner darkness striking Bulq across the chest. Bulq collapsed as Dooku watched his lieutenant die.</p><p> </p><p>   Secura successfully sabotaged the main shield before attacking and slaying Bok. The orbital bombardment began and Bulq's enterprise fell in ruins.</p><p>     Bulq's memory was not preserved among his people, either, as they rejected him for his own dismissal of the Quay religion. Many years after the holocrons with his personal notes came into the possession of Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order.</p>",

It is unspecified if the destruction was caused the vampires or if they simply knew humanity would eventually destroy itself. All that is known is that after the fall of our society, they took control and dubbed themselves the Nobility, enslaving humanity and using their scientific knowledge and magical abilities to rebuild the world in their image. During this time the Nobility began building technological wonders, cities, castles and creating strange creatures and set them free to roam with other mutants that were created from nuclear fallout. They also started manipulating human genetics, removing the ability to retain knowledge on vampire weaknesses and placing an inescapable fear of vampires in their subconscious.</p><p>Now many years later, in 12,090 A.D., many Vampire Hunters are hired to rid the planet of the few remaining Nobles that still terrorize certain sectors of the Frontier, despite the decline of their society. Vampire Hunters are the most specific and feared breed of hunter, and D is arguably the most feared of all.</p><p>Despite his immense beauty, D has an aura that is known to make even the most sturdy of creatures cower. D's past and origin is a very vague topic. It is heavily implied that he is the son of the Nobility's <a href=\"/dracula/4005-65186/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65186\">Sacred Ancestor</a> and a common woman named <a href=\"/wilhelmina-murray/4005-22206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22206\">Mina the Fair</a>. The Sacred Ancestor often performed strange cross-breeding rituals with countless women over the years.</p><p>After he impregnated the women, he would have them bear his children, then deem newborns failures, kill them and have the women bear more. He believes D to be the only one of these \"experiments\" that was a success. D's exact age is unknown and although he looks very young, he is assumed to be at least hundreds of years old, but many rumors say that he's near 10,000 years of age.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><ul><li>D's abilities range very wide considering his upbringing. D is not very muscular but he is super strong. He has been able to punch through solid stone walls and put enough muscle behind his sword to effectively slice through thick stone pillars. He is also very fast and extremely agile. Being able to dodge and outrun a volley of spears or arrows, not to mention being physically strong enough to successfully cross swords with the Nobility time and again.</li><li>D has shown the ability to destroy a hologram and prevents its reformation, with a mere strike from his blade. D's powers also extend to the negation of healing abilities, meaning that a strike from his sword which would normally heal in seconds, takes years to properly correct itself, if it heals at all.</li><li>D's stamina is nearly unmatched so long as he is not exposed to prolonged direct sunlight. As a <a href=\"http://vampirehunterd.wikia.com/wiki/Dhampir\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dhampir</a>, D is susceptible to Sun Sickness, but due to his highly unique physiology, it only occurs once every five years or so, unlike the usual month or so that was expected for Dhampirs. On the rare occasion D does suffer from Sun Sickness, he will recover far quicker than any other Dhampir.</li><li>In keeping with his noble lineage, D is nearly invulnerable, only really being damaged by overexposure to sunlight, extremely long periods without blood, or a fatal stake through the heart. However, he has displayed an immunity to the latter after his initial few staking's. Normal cuts or bruises heal almost instantly while major cuts and lacerations heal in a matter of minutes.</li><li>D is also a seasoned weapons master. However, he is most revered for his sword play. Most of the prey that fall to his sword only ever see a silver flash before thay die. He was able to decimate <a href=\"/rei-ginsei/4005-61989/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61989\">Rei-Ginsei</a>'s gang, who were renowned among the Frontier as some of the greatest Monster Hunters in the world, within 15 seconds each. Despite only using a normal sword, D has used it to accomplish many superhuman feats. He was able to slice a bolt of lightning as it was approaching a person he was watching and he has been shown to pierce the exterior of an invulnerable Nobility protective enclosure on a molecular level.</li><li>To compliment his swordsmanship, he is also an extremely accurate marksman. Able to hurl foot long wooden spikes at what ever target he has in his sights with deadly accuracy. Additionally, the speed at which D is capable of throwing these stakes is sufficient to have them incandesce from friction in mid-air. D is also an amazing tracker. He has hightened senses of smell, sight and hearing that he uses to pin point a mark. Additionally, D has several millennia worth of battle experience, and on the rare instance that he cannot decimate his opponent by physical means, he is able to out-smart and out-strategize them, such as when he used Rei-Ginsei's matter redirection ability against him.</li></ul><h3>Left Hand</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-543508\" data-ratio=\"0.5609756097561\" data-width=\"656\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 656px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-543508\"><img alt=\"Left Hand\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg 656w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Left Hand\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg 656w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19151/543508-vampirehunterd_lefthand_0001.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Left Hand</figcaption></figure><p>D has another edge over most anything he encounters on the Frontier. He has a parasite that lives in his <a href=\"/left-hand/4005-68894/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68894\">Left Hand</a>, appropriately named Left Hand. The parasite can talk and think just like a person, although it only appears as a set of eyes, a nose and a mouth in D's palm. \"Left Hand\" can be very useful, it has aided D by smelling prey that D could not, by seeing through solid objects to locate people on the other side, and was even able to bring D back from death after being staked through the heart.</p><p>Left hand can absorb any form of energy, and the four cardinal elements of Fire (all forms of heat), Water (any liquid, including blood and urine), Air, and Earth to grant D more power or revive him when his life is extinguished. Left hand has absorbed of note: a hundred billion volt pillar of lightning, the energy from a detonating nuke, energy straight from the heart of an anti-matter reactor, and a particle beam from a space cannon that burned through half the asteroid belt with enough power to punch through a planet two to three times Earth's size.</p><p>In the 6th novel, it absorbed hurricane force winds capable of blowing D away. He can also invade the minds of those it touches, drawing forth knowledge, or anything else it desires. Left hand once drained a lake of water to revive D after he was staked in the heart, and removed that weakness.

D is voiced by <a href=\"http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=852\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaneto Shiozawa</a> in the original Japanese and <a href=\"http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=3644\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael McConnohie</a> in the English dub. The series took several liberties with the source material, including changing numerous characters, and plot elements. The main story remains the same, however. D is hired by the farmer, <a href=\"http://vampirehunterd.wikia.com/wiki/Doris_Lang\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doris Lang</a>, in order to assassinate the Vampire Count <a href=\"/magnus-lee/4005-68295/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68295\">Magnus Lee</a> who had attacked her several nights earlier.

Lee had kidnapped Doris in order to wed her and complete her transformation into a Vampire. Lee's daughter, <a href=\"http://vampirehunterd.wikia.com/wiki/Larmica\" rel=\"nofollow\">Larmica</a>, admired the noble Hunter and began to grow weary of her father's consorting with \"lesser beings\".</p><p>After being initially overwhelmed by the powerful Count's telekinesis (cape manipulation and reformation in the novel), D ultimately defeats Lee by unleashing his Vampiric powers (using a technique taught to him by the Sacred Ancestor in the novel). Larmica chooses to stay behind in the crumbling castle, bidding farewell to D, and inquiring as to his lineage. D leaves a grateful Doris and Dan behind.</p><h4>Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18892/355508-82980-d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355508\" data-ratio=\"0.87368421052632\" data-width=\"380\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 380px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18892/355508-82980-d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355508\"><img alt=\"D\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18892/355508-82980-d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18892/355508-82980-d.jpg 380w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18892/355508-82980-d.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"D\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18892/355508-82980-d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18892/355508-82980-d.jpg 380w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18892/355508-82980-d.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>D</figcaption></figure><p>The second <a href=\"/vampire-hunter-d-bloodlust/4025-292/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-292\">Vampire Hunter D</a> film, released in 2000, is very loosely based on the third Vampire Hunter D novel; Demon Deathchase.

The gameplay is similar to the earlier games in the <i>Resident Evil</i> series; because characters are fully polygonal, whereas the backgrounds are pre-rendered. The story of the game is similar to that of the second movie, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. He is voiced by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeMita\" rel=\"nofollow\">John DeMita</a>. Essentially, D, a Dhampir (transliterated as Dunpeal) vampire hunter is hired by an old man named Elbourne to save his daughter Charlotte, who was kidnapped by a vampire, Meier Link. If his daughter was already transformed into a vampire, then D should kill her humanely. Also, Elbourne's son hired a team of human vampire hunters known as the Marcus Brothers to serve as backup. There are though, some differences between the game and the movie.</p><p>Only two of the Barbarois mutants (Benge and Mashira) appear as enemies, <a href=\"http://vampirehunterd.wikia.com/wiki/Caroline\" rel=\"nofollow\">Caroline</a> not being featured. Borgoff and Leila were the only members of the Marcus brothers which were notably featured; Kyle, Nolt, and Grove just make some cameos in cut-scenes, and later are found dead. There are 3 possible endings based on your actions in-game, 1 of which is similar to the end of the film. The game shares some of the voice actors of the film.</p>",

    "description": "<h3>Past</h3><p>When Tokiko was a little girl, the school where she went to kindergarten was attacked by a Homunculus, killing everyone there as they tried to protect her. This incident left Tokiko with a long scar across her face and a deep hatred of the Homunculi. After that day, she began training in the art of Alchemy, and slowly became a formidable force against the Homunculi. She eventually quit her school so that she could become a more proficient warrior. At some point, she joined the Alchemic Regiment, and began to rise through the ranks, eventually becoming a high-ranking member at the age of seventeen.</p><h3>Kazuki Muto</h3><p>One night, Tokiko was sent on a mission to eliminate multiple Homunculi in a large Japanese City. After some work and study, she was able to locate a small abandoned factory behind one of the town’s schools in which the Homunculi were coming from. She noticed a large, serpentine Homunculus, created from a teacher at the school in front of the factory, the Ginsei Private School. She followed the Homunculus into the factory, and began posing as an innocent girl who had wandered into the factory in the hopes it would draw out the Homunculus. The plan worked, and the Homunculus attempted to sneak up behind her and eat her before she could run. She prepared to attack, when something suddenly pushed her out of the way, and she turned to see a school boy, around her age, standing where she had just stood. Before she could do anything though, the snake struck forward, hitting the boy directly in the heart, and he screamed with his last breath as he fell to the ground, dead. As the Homunculus prepared another attack, she grabbed the boy’s body and retreated quickly from the area.</p><p>Tokiko stopped on top of the school’s water tower, slowly placing the boy on the roof of the water tower. Looking down at the body, she began speaking to him, asking him if he could still hear her. He did not respond, and she told him that this was his fault for being so brash in the face of imminent danger, and that his brashness had lost him his heart to the Homunculus. Then, as she continued to look at the boy, she found her hand going to her right skirt pocket, and her hand closed over a hexagonal object. She continued to speak to stating that he had only thrown himself into danger to save her from being killed, and she pulled from her pocket a Kakugane, an alchemic tool. She bent over with the object in hand, and brought it to the boy’s now heartless chest, telling him that he now was being given a second chance, the power of a new life. The Kakugane slowly began phasing into the boy’s chest, and she told him that he also had a different power, a power only fueled by his will to fight, and that, when he needed it, he would find his Kakugane taking the shape of his weapon. She then lifted the boy up, and using what the boy had on him, she was able to locate his house and his name, <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> Muto. She brought <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> home, and carefully laid him down to bead before making a swift retreat.</p><p>As she stood outside, she began hearing shouting from within the dormitory, and she turned back, hearing the people she deduced to be his friends. She pulled out her cell phone, sending one message to the boy’s cell phone (which she had gotten as she had looked for his address) before turning to leave.</p><p>The next day, she began following the boy, who had classes with the Homunculus posing as a school teacher. She realized the danger he was in, as a Homunculus would hunt down someone who had seen their real identity until that person was dead. As <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> finished his lunch and the bell for his class rang, he noticed the message on his cell hone, and, as she watched from the water tower that she had brought him back to life, he read Tokiko’s message: “Take good care of your new life.”</p><p>That night, Tokiko was called away to some other unknown business, and she abandoned her watch on <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a>. As she began returning, she had a feeling that he was in danger, and quickly called him on his cell phone. He picked up, and on the other side of the line, she could hear him running away from something, confirming her suspicion. She told him to hang on for the three minutes it would take her to get there, but she was quickly bombarded by many questions from <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> about the situation, and she quickly told him that what he was being chased by was a Homunculus, a creature that posed among the humans so that they could get close enough to them to eat them. She then informs <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> that she was sent their to kill the Homunculus, and accidentally got Him involved the night before.</p><p>On the other side of the line, Tokiko heard <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> stumble before he told her that the Homunculus was catching up to him, and she realized that there was no other option then letting him use his Buso Renkin (the weapon created from the Kakugane), and she told him he could now use his powers so that he could combat the monster. <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> was shocked at her telling him to fight a giant monster, and Tokiko realized that he couldn’t remember what she had told him while he was dead. On the other line, he said how he was getting out of there, but Tokiko told him just how useless this idea was, as he would be chased by any Homunculus for eternity, and that he could never run away from them. She heard as <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> came to a stop, and then he hung up on her. She continued to run back to the school.</p><p>When Tokiko finally arrived at the scene, she saw the monster writhing in pain, and she jumped towards it as <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a>, holding his sister, burst from within the creatures stomach, a lance type Buso Renkin in his hand. As he fell passed her, she commented on how much the lance was like him, as it took no thought to thrust it through a body. She then pulled from her pocket her own Kakugane, and summoned her own Buso Renkin, the Valkyrie Skirt, two leg braces with two arms on each brace. At the end of the arms were scythes, one of which was quickly thrust through the Homunculus’s head, killing it instantly. She then told <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> to always aim for the seal on their head, as that was their weakness, before adding that he should be careful how he landed as well, or else he would die.</p><p>After the two had landed on the ground safely, <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> told her how he had arrived at the factory the previous night. He had seen the Homunculus going inside, and his curiosity had taken the best of him. He followed it inside, where he saw her, who he thought didn’t know the monster was there, and he had died saving her. She told him just how useless that was, as she could easily defend herself, and actually knew that the Homunculus was behind her. The girl who <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> had been holding (his sister), who had been propped up on a tree, began to stir, and <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> rushed over to her, dropping his lance in the process. Tokiko moved quickly as he stumbled, catching him, telling him to be less rash, as she was in much better shape then him. He said how relieved that made him, and she told him how different he was, adding that that made her at least caused her to like him a little, causing the boy in front of her to blush. She quickly picked up his lance, offering it back to him, and telling him that he had to keep it with him at all times, since it was his new heart. <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> then brought the lance in front of him, staring at it, before turning to Tokiko and asking her what Alchemy was. She told him that it was in the dictionary, and she began to explain the complex principles of alchemy to him.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The unofficial leader of the 'genies,' Ethan intervened when Herod visited his brother, gaining the powers that were initially intended for him. Many members of his family are police officers and firefighters while his mother is a paramedic. Highly responsible as well as naturally heroic and seemingly ceaselessly optimistic, Ethan encourages the others to press forward to investigate what has happened to them. In his first earthly encounter with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70796\" href=\"/gwendolyne-matsura/4005-70796/\" slug=\"gwendolyne-matsura\">Gwendolyne</a>, he helps her fight off gang members who had been pressuring her father but then saves one of them after Sweetie barbecues her. He is also responsible for bringing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70798\" href=\"/hamza-mansour-al-rashad/4005-70798/\" slug=\"hamza-mansour-al-rashad\">Hamza</a> back to life after he wrecks one of his father's limos. When his mother is shot and critically injured by an enemy of the team known as the Chrome, Ethan refuses to leave her side for some time, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52015\" href=\"/janelle/4005-52015/\" slug=\"janelle\">Ja'nelle</a> secures his help and he returns to the team. When his uniform manifests, it is a firefighter's jacket.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Ethan is able to manipulate energy, which he refers to as his 'flame.' He can unleash energy blasts, boost his teammates' abilities, drain others, and heal people, which he has used to bring others back to life. He also can use his power in more specified manners, severing the link between Emily and her host, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23578\" href=\"/fairchild/4005-23578/\" slug=\"fairchild\">Fairchild</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>James Tarleton was a commoner in 18th Century England. He was running from the press gangs when he was abducted by the alient <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57007\" href=\"/tsrri/4060-57007/\">T'srri</a> and placed in stasis. The conversion to T'srri did not complete fully but he was given the ability to disintegrate matter on touch and generate bio-armor around his body. He could also understand all languages and see in the dark. Jamie was always headstrong and disobedient, resisting his duties in <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42950\" href=\"/weapon-zero/4060-42950/\">Weapon Zero</a>. The T'srri <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24656\" href=\"/erisha/4005-24656/\">Erisha</a> seduced him and convinced him to leave Weapon Zero. After that, he was easy to capture and complete his indoctrination into T'srri.</p>",

He was obsessed with discovering the location of the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57178\" href=\"/valley-of-the-jedi/4020-57178/\" slug=\"valley-of-the-jedi\">Valley of the Jedi</a> - the legendary nexus of power where hundreds of Jedi and Sith died in the final act battle of the New Sith Wars. The location of this place had been lost to the sands of time, but Jerec believed it existed and desired it for his own power. He found and tortured Morgan Katarn, the father of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48287\" href=\"/kyle-katarn/4005-48287/\" slug=\"kyle-katarn\">Kyle Katarn</a>, for the location. But he would not yield.

He led his group of Seven Dark Jedi, including his apprentice, Sariss, on his quest for power. In the process, Jerec killed Qu Rahm -</p><p>Kyle Katarn, the son of Morgan Katarn, hunted Jerec down. He followed Jerec to the Valley. However, Kyle discovered that Jerec was holding Jan Ors - Kyle's Rebel agent partner and romantic interesting - and was using her to lure Kyle to the Dark Side. Kyle refused Jerec's offer of power. In rage, Jerec brought down the surrounding area, leaving Kyle for dead as he ventured into the Valley. Kyle awakened, striking down Jerec's Dark Jedi one by one. But he wasn't able to stop Jerec from bathing in the Valley's power, approaching a power that - Kyle feared - may have rivaled the Emperor. Kyle, however, was able to defeat him by wrapping him in a barrier made up of the light side of the Force, cutting Jerec off from his power. Kyle was able to strike him down, freeing the spirits within the Valley.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2499835-jerec.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2499835\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.495\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2499835-jerec.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2499835\"><img alt=\"Jerec unleashing a blast of Force energy\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2499835-jerec.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41224/2499835-jerec.jpg 600w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/41224/2499835-jerec.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41224/2499835-jerec.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Jerec unleashing a blast of Force energy</figcaption></figure><p>Like all Miraluka, Jerec is naturally blind, the black strip covering his eyes.

He wasn't popular or a geek or class clown. He was just another average student at his high school. Nothing special about him really.. just a kid who fantasized about becoming a real life superhero. Certain things stood in the way of his ambition though, like not having the confidence to talk to a girl he liked, nor the strength to defend himself in a fight. His mother died of an aneurysm when he was fourteen and he lived with his <a href=\"/mr-lizewski/4005-51841/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51841\">dad</a>, who was still having problems coping with her death. As an escape, Dave played with video games, himself, and read a lot of comic books. He became so obsessed with super heroics that he decided that was the career he wanted for himself, even though superheroes didn't really exist in the world for good reason.</p><p>One night he decided to put on a costume. He spent the first few weeks walking around on rooftops getting used to the costume and enjoying the thrill of wearing it underneath his clothes. He spent time working out in his high school gym during lunch and also ate high protein foods to try and pack on lean muscle all the while trying to come up with a name.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>\"The Greatest Superhero of All Time\"</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/411532-19545_20080605033950_char.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-411532\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"3.0466666666667\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:304.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/411532-19545_20080605033950_char.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-411532\"><img alt=\"Kick-Ass\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/411532-19545_20080605033950_char.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/411532-19545_20080605033950_char.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></a><figcaption>Kick-Ass</figcaption></figure><p>One day he decided to go into action. Seeing some kids spray painting a wall, he felt this was his time. Gaining courage from wearing a mask and costume, he approached and insulted the three kids. After an exchanging of words, a fight began with a costumed Dave throwing the first attack that came in the form of a improvised miniature bat. He used bottles as well as his own weapon to fight off the thugs but their numbers (three) overwhelmed him. Things didn't go so well as Dave ended up getting stabbed by the first man that he attacked upon arriving on the scene.</p><p>The thugs rushed off and Dave struggled to walk home. Crossing the road, he ends up getting hit by a car and became a victim of a hit and run as the ones responsible fled the area. He was left with two broken legs and a crushed spine yet in his horrendous state he was able to take off his costume and hide it before the paramedics arrived.</p><p>After months of counseling and therapy, Dave burned most of his comic books and promised himself to never partake in heroics ever again. A promise he immediately broke.</p><p>Donning his costume once again, he roams the streets only to find a man getting mugged by three \"Puerto Ricans\". This time Dave was armed with not one but two of the improvised mini-bats which he kept strapped to his back. In an act of bravery or stupidity he decided to take on the three men. The fight instantly became bloody and again Dave became overwhelmed by the number of attackers. This time though, he was able to fight himself out of the beating reaching a point where the Puerto Ricans left saying that he was \"f***ing nuts\". The crowd, that had gathered to watch the battle, cheered Dave on, while a young man takes out his cellphone and records the fight, putting it on youtube for all to see. Dave becomes a local celebrity and his costumed persona finally has a name, given to him by the masses: Kick-Ass.</p><p>In his regular life, he gains confidence and even gets the courage to talk to the hottest girl in school and she reciprocates. By now Dave is on cloud nine only to be brought down by his best friend Toddy Haynes when he tells him that everyone thinks he is gay because he was found naked when he first donned the costume. Being the opportunist, Dave played the role of the supposed \"gay best friend\" just so he could be close to the girl that he had a crush on. He also received a can of mace from his <a href=\"/mr-lizewski/4005-51841/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51841\">father</a> who showed concern from all of Dave's new cuts and bruises.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-517791\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4911196911197\" data-width=\"1295\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1295px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-517791\"><img alt=\"Hit-Girl and Big Daddy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\" data-width=\"643\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg 1295w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg 643w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hit-Girl and Big Daddy\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg 1295w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22062/517791-scan0001.jpg 643w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\" data-width=\"643\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hit-Girl and Big Daddy</figcaption></figure><p>As Kick-Ass he sets up a My space page to come into contact with victims or people who need his assistance. On his first mission he went to a hotel building looking to deal with a man named Eddie Lomas. The call came from Eddies ex-girlfriend saying that he was making crank calls to her and she asked Kick-Ass to go have a little \"talk\" with him. After a few condescending jokes about Dave's costume made by Eddie and his crew, a fight breaks out between Kick-ass and Lomas's posse. He used the can of mace that his father gave him on Eddie but was quickly stuck from behind. It looked evident that Kick-Ass was about to be severely beaten. again when suddenly a mysterious young girl in costume carrying a pair of katana swords appears. She uses the sword first on Eddie, driving it through his back. Then she uses it on one of the crew members, cutting half of his head off. With two men now dead, she makes an open challenge to the rest of the people in the room,as she began to pull out a second katana sword.</p><p>Unlike Dave, the young girl was well trained and ruthless in her form of justice. He watched as she one by one killed the people in the room thinking \"she handled those knives like a f***ing surgeon\". When it was over she assured him that they were on the same side and took off so that cops would not find her at the scene. Kick-Ass followed only to see her go to a large costumed man. Through their interaction, Kick-Ass found out that the girl's name was <a href=\"/hit-girl/4005-56881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56881\">Hit-Girl</a> and the man was known as <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big Daddy</a>. As they fled, Kick-Ass was impressed at how they carried themselves and the tactics they used and called them \"the real deal\".</p><p>The murder of the people in the Lomas house made Dave extremely uneasy. Thinking that it could all be pinned back to him, he vowed to never again put on the costume again in fear of going to jail. His meeting with <a href=\"/hit-girl/4005-56881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56881\">Hit-Girl</a> and <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big Daddy</a> left him wondering and he began to search the internet, where he had become popular but could find nothing on them. After a conversation with Eddie Lomas' ex-girlfriend, Dave feels more comfortable about his name staying clear but still is convinced that he will never become Kick-Ass again.</p><h3>Super Hero Once Again</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/664015-hh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-664015\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4708333333333\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/664015-hh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-664015\"><img alt=\"The Red Mist\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\" data-width=\"652\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/664015-hh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/664015-hh.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Red Mist\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/664015-hh.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22062/664015-hh.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\" data-width=\"652\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Red Mist</figcaption></figure><p>For a few weeks Dave had laid low, not doing any type of vigilante hero work but that was all it took for him to be replaced. In that time span a new hero had emerged and in Dave's eyes had become an attention-whore. After checking out some forums Dave decided that for a few nights it was time to hit the streets again donning the costume one more time as Kick-Ass but found that the city was calmer then ever. Dave then found himself once again playing the gay best friend role with his long time crush <a href=\"/katie-deauxma/4005-57161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57161\">Katie Deauxma</a>. She could sense that something was not right and after thinking quickly his response to her in an attempt to cover his true feeling were that he was afraid to tell his father about the gay stuff. After some soothing words by <a href=\"/katie-deauxma/4005-57161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57161\">Katie</a>, Dave reiterated the fact that he was not a homosexual by concealing the fact that he had an erection as she laid her head on his chest to comfort him. After news reports that gave the new hero that called himself <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">The Red Mist</a> credit for Kick-Ass's accomplishments, Dave had had enough. By using MySpace which was dubbed the twenty-first century version of the <a href=\"/bat-signal/4055-55819/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55819\">Bat-Signal</a>, Kick-Ass arranged a meeting with <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">The Red Mist</a> to get some answers. To Kick-Ass' surprise when they met <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">The Red Mist</a> claimed to be his biggest fan.</p><p>After a small talk <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">Red Mist</a> asked Kick-Ass to do a team-up for the night and introduced him to the Mist Mobile. The two seemed to hit it off and became good friends while they patrolled the city. When the night seemed to be winding down they ran into something that neither of them expected, a burning down building. At first glance, <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">The Red Mist</a> was reluctant to go in but after some persuasion by Kick-Ass they both ran into the building looking for a woman's baby that was named Charlie. The whole time <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">Red Mist</a> complained saying that Kick-Ass was nuts and when they finally found the \"baby\" it turned out to be a cat. The fire had then became too overwhelming and the building came down on them but they were rescued by the firefighters that had shown up later.</p><p>When the two left the scene they were received as heroes making such an impact that they brought people to tears. When Dave returned home he jumped on the web and noticed that he had regained his \"rockstar\" status. Little did he know that <a href=\"/hit-girl/4005-56881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56881\">Hit-Girl</a> and <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big Daddy</a> were in his room. After getting his attention they showed that they were not impressed with what he had done. But wanted to see how he would do against the mob.</p><h3>The Betrayal</h3><p>While <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big-Daddy</a> held him down, the pair of vigilantes offered Kick-Ass a chance to team up with them. They were going after the mob's \"Boss of Bosses\" and needed the help of Kick-Ass and <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">The Red Mist</a>. At first <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big-Daddy</a> opposed but after speaking to his daughter <a href=\"/hit-girl/4005-56881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56881\">Hit-Girl</a> he agreed that a team-up needed to be done. After releasing his grip on him, <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big-Daddy</a> orders <a href=\"/hit-girl/4005-56881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56881\">Hit-Girl</a> to tell Kick-Ass their origin. She begins to speak and reveals that <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big-Daddy</a> is her father and a former police officer that \"couldn't be paid off\". Also she said that the mob killed his wife, her mother and that is why they were on a quest for revenge. At first Dave was reluctant claiming that he did not want to kill but was left with no choice when <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big-Daddy</a> blackmailed him say that if he and <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">The Red Mist</a> did not work with them he would leak his identity on the internet. Dave eventually tells Katie Deuxma he is not gay, and was using it as an excuse to be close to her. She says some choice words to him and basically tells him to get lost.</p><p>By this point Dave was changed. The things that mattered to him before seemed irrelevant. It was becoming harder for him to relate to non \"superheroes\". He soon met up with <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">The Red Mist</a> to decide on what they would do. <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">Red Mist</a> seemed reluctant but after a conversation with Kick-Ass decided to meet at <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big-Daddy</a>'s hideout. The two then parted and Dave had a rush of adrenaline that he said came from second-hand contact from <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">The Red Mist</a>'s weed . He went to <a href=\"/katie-deauxma/4005-57161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57161\">Katie Deauxma</a>'s house and shouted at her window \"I've been Kick-Ass all along and I'm not gay\" but as soon as she opened the window he cowered and ran away. Later he meets up with <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">Red Mist</a> again this time heading to the hideout of <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big-Daddy</a> and <a href=\"/hit-girl/4005-56881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56881\">Hit-Girl</a>. They make their way inside to find <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big-Daddy</a> severely beaten up and <a href=\"/hit-girl/4005-56881/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56881\">Hit-Girl</a> crying by his side. <a href=\"/big-daddy/4005-57159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57159\">Big-Daddy</a> notices Kick-Ass at the door and asks for his help but before he could act, <a href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\">The Red Mist</a> pulls a gun and points it to the back of Dave's head showing his allegiance to the mob. Dave is beaten, Big Daddy is gunned down and Hitgirl is wounded, but Dave refuses to talk. Hitgirl returns and kills some of the mobsters.</p><p>The two vigilantes strategise an assault on Genovese, and Hitgirl manages to kill him. Dave beats Red Mist into submission and leaves him defeated. Afterwards, Dave helps Hitgirl return to normal, going home to her mother and her stepfather. He discovers his father has got his sexlife back on track, and instead of being shocked, he is happy for him. One day at school, Dave approaches Katie Deuxma and confesses that he was never gay and he had been lying to her all that time. Engraged, she gets her boyfriend Carl to punch him, giving him a bloody nose. That night, after walking in on his Dad and a woman he met on a grieving forum, Dave is texted a picture of Katie and Carl having oral sex.</p><h3>Hit Girl</h3><p><b>For more information see <a href=\"/hit-girl/4050-49937/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-49937\">Hit-Girl</a>.</b></p><p>Sometime after the events of Kick Ass, Mindy and David make a deal she'll teach him to be a Super hero and he will teach her to fit in at school. Mindy has David take an oath of Justice and teaches him how to crash through windows and beat up thugs. Then one night the pair go to take down a Russian gang. Everything is going well but David breaks his hand on a thugs face and Mindy is \"forced\" to use lethal means to get David out safely. The broken hand leaves David on the injure list for at least two months. Meanwhile Mindy takes down the Genovese family. When David's hand is better, Mindy finds him and though she gave up the cape and promised her step-father not to be Hit Girl, she has decided to train David to be a great crime fighter.</p><h3>Balls to the Wall</h3><p>In the comic series sequel, Kick-Ass is now being trained by a reformed Hit Girl. He also is affiliated with the new superhero team called Justice Forever, being led by Colonel Stars, and his new crime-fighting ally, Doctor Gravity. He now works frequently on gang-busting with his new found team, as well as his long-time friend Marty as Battle Guy, sharing inside crime-fighting jokes with him during his school life. He and his team have currently broken into a bar, beaten down, and apprehended a gang.</p><p>Sometime after apprehending the gang, Dave comes home to see that his Dad found his Kick Ass costume and isn't happy about it. They argue about him being hero and Dave storms out of the house.</p><p>At the Justice Forever hideout, Colonel Stars is setting up the team's table with its own logo. After not hearing his dog a moment later, he is immediately concerned. Formerly Red Mist, now the Motherfucker, and his gang bust in and trash the place while they beat up the Colonel to the point of death. Wanting to send a message, the gang cut off the Colonel's dog's head and put it on the Colonel's body. They also wrote the Motherfucker's name on the wall. Dave and the rest of Justice Forever mourn the death of their great leader.</p><p>The MotherFucker's gang go to the street where Kate lives (Dave's crush) and start killing people there. They raid her house, kill her parents and then rape her. All the while, Mother Russia is outside killing the police that arrive. The police issue a ban on all people wearing costumes across New York and track all of the ip addresses of the costumed people including Dave. While Dave visits Kate in the hospital the police show up at Dave's house but his Dad takes the fall for being Kick Ass so Dave won't have to go to jail. Dave shows up while his Dad is being apprehended and tells him not to go but he can't stop him. Dave's friends Marty and Todd take him in while his Dad is in jail. Dave gets a text from the Motherfucker with a picture of his Dad hanged in jail with a noose. Dave is overwhelmed with sadness.</p><p>Dave goes to the funeral to mourn the loss and the Motherfucker says that they will have a ceasefire to celebrate Kick Ass's loss and they won't interrupt the wedding. Justice Forever show up dressed in funeral clothing to pay their respects and tell Dave that they wish they could help get revenge but the police won't allow it. Dave doesn't want revenge but he is just sad. Mindy (Hit Girl) is also at the wedding and asks Dave if he is mad at her for not getting involved. Dave says that he wasn't mad at her at all. At this time, the villains break their promise by bombing the funeral. They kidnap Dave with intent of bringing him the Motherfucker's hideout.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Kick-Ass Live Action Film</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926058-shut_up_kick_ass_poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2926058\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.484\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926058-shut_up_kick_ass_poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2926058\"><img alt=\"Movie poster for Kick-Ass\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px\" data-width=\"646\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926058-shut_up_kick_ass_poster.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926058-shut_up_kick_ass_poster.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Movie poster for Kick-Ass\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926058-shut_up_kick_ass_poster.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926058-shut_up_kick_ass_poster.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px\" data-width=\"646\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Movie poster for Kick-Ass</figcaption></figure><p>In the 2010 film <i><a href=\"/kick-ass/4025-707/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-707\">Kick-Ass</a>,</i> Kick-Ass is portrayed by Aaron Johnson. The film had a much lighter plot than the comic series, particularly in the relationship between Katie and Kick-Ass. In the film, Katie is fine when he tells her that he isn't gay, and he also reveals that he is Kick-Ass. The two end up dating, and are still a couple at the end of the film.</p><h3>Kick-Ass Video Game</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1364604\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1364604\"><img alt=\"Kick-Ass in the Kick-Ass video game\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg 1280w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kick-Ass in the Kick-Ass video game\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg 1280w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62398/1364604-16736orig.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kick-Ass in the Kick-Ass video game</figcaption></figure><p>Kick-Ass appears as a playable character in the Kick-Ass video game, which is based off of the events in the movie.</p><h3>Kick-Ass 2 Live Action Film</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926066-kick_ass_2_poster_moretz.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2926066\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5838414634146\" data-width=\"656\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 656px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926066-kick_ass_2_poster_moretz.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2926066\"><img alt=\"Kick-Ass 2 movie poster\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" data-width=\"606\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/131703/2926066-kick_ass_2_poster_moretz.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926066-kick_ass_2_poster_moretz.jpg 656w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/131703/2926066-kick_ass_2_poster_moretz.jpg 606w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kick-Ass 2 movie poster\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/131703/2926066-kick_ass_2_poster_moretz.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2926066-kick_ass_2_poster_moretz.jpg 656w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/131703/2926066-kick_ass_2_poster_moretz.jpg 606w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" data-width=\"606\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kick-Ass 2 movie poster</figcaption></figure><p>The film sequel to Kick-Ass is entitled <i><a href=\"/kick-ass-2-balls-to-the-wall/4025-1562/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1562\">Kick-Ass 2: Balls to the Wall</a></i> and it is to be release on August 16, 2013.</p>",

Dave had taken off his suit before the paramedics found him, so when Mr. Lizwewski arrives at the hospital he believes that Dave had been mugged. After nine months, Mr. Lizewski gets his son back from the hospital and Dave goes back to super-heroing as Kick-Ass, unbeknownst to his father. In the meantime he tries online dating and meets Lucille and they begin dating.</p><h3>Kick-Ass 2</h3><p>A little while later, Jimmy's been dumped by Lucille and he returns to his old self, feeding his son chili. He noticed that Dave has been sleepy lately and had heard from one his neighbors that she heard him sneak into their house at 4 AM. He confronts Dave about this and asks if he is doing drugs and Dave tells him no. He doesn't believe him and searches Dave's room where he finds Dave's Kick-Ass costume. When Dave gets home the two have an argument and Dave tells him he doesn't want to end up like him, takes his suit, and storms out.</p><p>When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59157\" href=\"/the-red-mist/4005-59157/\">Chris Genovese</a> leads his gang on a massacre, the police decide to round up every person wearing a cape in New York. Following the IP address, the police show up to arrest Kick-Ass and Dave's father tells them that he is Kick-Ass and is taken to prison. Dave later visits him in prison and asks why he did this and he tells him that he couldn't allow his son to go to prison. He also makes Dave promise never to put on a costume again and tells him not to worry, that he can handle himself inside. That night, while Mr. Lizewski is watching TV in the prison cafeteria, Chris Genovese's men beat him and hang him. They take a picture and text it to Kick-Ass.</p>",

The more complicated reason being he viewed her as someone who could be turned to the lightside as he thought her apprentice Yun could be.</p>",

    "deck": "Tesseract is a warrior in the Ultimate Universe capable of using multiple versions of himself from other dimensions in battle as well as attacking enemies from outside three dimensional space.",
    "description": "<p>Tesseract is regarded as one of the most powerful Seed warriors of Halcyon, as he possesses the power to combine and share the strength of an infinite number of his alternate-dimensional counterparts.</p><p>Recognizing Tesseract's power, <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> kidnapped him and had him brainwashed. He achieved this by implanting Tesseract with synthetic nerve cells. These controlled his will and caused him to believe he was loyal to the Acheron Empire. Acting on their own initiative, <a href=\"/seed-nineteen/4060-51537/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51537\">Seed Nineteen</a> rescued Tesseract. They managed to narrowly escape to a lower dimension, that of Earth 1610. There they found themselves in Earth's New York City. After a misunderstanding led to a confrontation with the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>. Tesseract was again captured by Thanos' forces led by his son, <a href=\"/gallowglass/4005-51527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51527\">Gallowglass</a>.</p><p>After pursuing Thanos' forces back to their dimension, <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> defeated Gallowglass by turning his own volatile powers against him. The ensuing explosion destroyed Gallowglass' ship. The Fantastic Four escaped unharmed with Tesseract, but were stranded on the Acheron-controlled planet of Pyx in the city of Ironwater. There Susan Storm, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> and Dreamcatcher brought Tesseract to a Seed hideout within the city and attempted to remove his neural implants.</p><p>The Fantastic Four and Seed Nineteen were then brought to Earth and forced to battle <a href=\"/ronan/4005-4818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4818\">Ronan The Accuser</a>, Thanos' other son. Tesseract was revived by Dreamcatcher and fought Ronan with his dimensional abilities. However, Tesseract was in a weakened state as a result of his ordeal and was eventually defeated by Ronan. Ronan is ultimately defeated when Reed Richards has the idea to use Dreamcatcher's powers to combine the powers of both the Fantastic Four and Seed Nineteen. After this Tesseract returns with Seed Nineteen to liberate Pyx. Later, when Reed Richards constructed the <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\">Cosmic Cube</a>. Tesseract led the Halycon infiltration team that infiltrated the Baxter Building to seize the Cube. Before they could do so, the Cube defended itself throwing up a force field that froze all within it. Richards freed Tesseract and his team from the paralysis. The Halycons fought and subdued the Four, but Tesseract admitted that he was reluctant to harm the Four considering what they had previously done for him. Before they could depart with the Cube, Richards used his mental control over it to teleport Tesseract and his team away.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Tesseract possesses one of the most compelling supernatural abilities ever unleashed, the power to impassively channel the might of his alternate incarnations across the multiverse to grant himself tremendous, conceivably infinite, levels of superhuman strength, resistance to conventional injury, speed, and reflexes. By concentrating, Tesseract can focus each incarnation over his body to increase the amount of force (strength) needed to bench (lift) heavy objects, combat (strike) an opponent, block (toughness) and react (respond) to incoming assault, and leap prolonged distances. As the nexus between intermittent realities, the presence of these personified manifestations assemble collectively parallel to his being when activated, emphasizing his unique endowment. Furthermore, he's permitted to attack enemies outside three-dimensional space; when inflicting punishment to those that deserve it, the fabric of reality bends to produce incongruent, abstract mechanisms to surround each monumental stroke. As well, he can teleport in full or distinctively in portions by collapsing into an assortment of cubic shapes, shifting and reforming near-instantly wherever he decides. Emanating a bright light between his hands causes the laws of physics to break to the point where Tesseract can broadcast his thoughts and read the minds of others, and achieve a pulsing beacon capable of navigating specific targets to his location.</p>",
