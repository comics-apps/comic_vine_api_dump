He was not respected by the town of Smallville, and took this out on his \"bookworm\" son. When Lex was in his final year of high school, Lionel was the victim of a series of unusual and near-fatal accidents, which resulted in his being saved by the mysterious \"Super-Boy\" that haunted the town in those days.</p><p>This came to a head when his underlying heart condition was activated by an allergic reaction to medication. Upon his death, Lex Luthor took the insurance money on his father's claim and absconded.</p><p>Little is known of his life besides.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Powers</h3><p>Under normal circumstances, Lionel Luthor did not possess any superhuman capabilities. On one occasion however, he came into possession of a Kryptonian relic that enabled him to switch minds with Clark Kent. Inhabiting Kent's body, Lionel had access to all of Clark's powers, but he was only aware of a few of his abilities. He used super-strength to lift a tractor. He used heat-vision to accidentally start a fire at the Kent Farm, then used his invulnerability to put the fire out. After unwillingly returning to his normal body, Lionel lost all memory of the incident, but felt a great change come over him, as if a portion of Clark's strong moral fiber had remained behind.</p><h3>Abilities</h3><ul><li><b>Business Management</b>: Lionel Luthor was a cutthroat businessman and an expert strategist. He negotiated the boardroom the way a Roman general would lead a battlefield.</li></ul><h3>Strength level</h3><p><b>Above Average</b>: Although middle aged, Lionel Luthor was in surprisingly good shape. He possessed the strength level of a man his age, size and weight who engaged in intensive regular exercise. While functioning as a conduit for the spirit of Jor-El, Lionel's strength and stamina appeared to increase. However, this was only a temporary effect.</p><h2>Paraphernalia</h2><h3>Transportation</h3><p>Lionel availed himself of several vehicles owned by LuthorCorp - notably his personal limousine and helicopter.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Lionel was known to always keep a handgun secreted away for emergency use, but traditionally he did not carry any weaponry. In his own mind, Lionel considered Clark Kent as his own \"secret weapon\". Lionel also briefly kept a kryptonite cage.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><p><b>Smallville</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1817996-830px_1010smallville1768.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1817996\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56265060240964\" data-width=\"830\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 830px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1817996-830px_1010smallville1768.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1817996\"><img alt=\"Lionel Luthor Earth-2\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63864/1817996-830px_1010smallville1768.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1817996-830px_1010smallville1768.jpg 830w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63864/1817996-830px_1010smallville1768.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Lionel Luthor Earth-2</figcaption></figure><p>Lionel Luthor appears in the television series, Smallville, as the father of Lex Luthor and <a href=\"../../lena-thorul/29-36776/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tess Mercer</a>.

This makes Jade over ten millennia old despite her youthful and nubile appearance. At some point in the past the Emperor of Outworld <a href=\"/shao-kahn/4005-49430/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49430\">Shao Kahn</a> would succeed in conquering Edenia and would come to merge the Edenian realm with <a href=\"/outworld/4020-55787/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55787\">Outworld</a> to rule over both. Still a young child at the time Jade would be given to Shao Kahn as a tribute and gift by her family. Shao Kahn would take the young girl and force her into intense training, honing and chiseling the young Edenian into a lethal fighting machine, and proficient assassin. Centuries of intense training molding Jade into a fearsome and skilled warrior, one of the many in the service of Shao Kahn alongside others such as Kitana and her sister <a href=\"/mileena/4005-49416/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49416\">Mileena</a> who had likewise received similar disciplining and training. Jade would eventually be recognized for her efficiency and effectiveness as a warrior and ninja and chosen by Shao Kahn to serve as a bodyguard for his adopted daughter Kitana the two woman establishing a deep bond and friendship.</p><p>Clad in green ninja wear Jade would gain a reputation as a confident, ruthless, sassy warrior with incredible agility feats and sleek stealth skills, and she would prove herself loyal, sincere and sympathetic towards her friend and charge Kitana. Eventually Lady Kitana would develop doubts over her father Shao Kahn's actions and motives, and when she looked for answers and truths she would discover horrific betrayals, deception, murder and regicide. Kitana would learn that Mileena was not her true biological twin sister rather a clone of herself, one created by Shao Kahn's most trusted adviser <a href=\"/shang-tsung/4005-15541/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15541\">Shang Tsung</a> and his dark sorcery and magic.</p><p>Furthermore Shang Tsung would infuse Kitana's clone with <a href=\"/tarkatan/4060-58434/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58434\">Tarkatan</a> genetics as Shao Kahn had wished for a more ferocious and loyal daughter to replace Kitana with should she rebel. Princess Kitana would also learn Shao Kahn's actions towards her true parents, his murder of her pure and good father King Jerrod and the tampering of her memory. Her life was effectively a lie. Disgusted Kitana would rebel against her father and would chose to ally with the Earth Realm warriors aiding them where she could and developing a fierce rivalry with Mileena.</p><p>Shao Kahn would at first send Jade to recapture Kitana for lack of loyalty and the two friends would fight each other, Jade puzzled by Kitana's actions and attitude. When Jade would also realize the truth surrounding Kitana's past and Shao Kahn's misdeeds and the creation of Mileena she would reconcile and side with Kitana, freeing her friend from Shao Kahn's dungeon. Jade would also go on and become and ally to the Earth Realm warriors, and would also go on to embrace her Edenian heritage, seeking to restore her native realm of Edenia to its former glory.</p><p>Jade would also lead as the General of the Edenian Army. Jade arms herself with a mystical metal extendable bo staff and typically wears tight fitting ninja garb with green and black as her signature colors.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Jade was created for the popular video game fighting game franchise Mortal Kombat, the popular femme fatale created by Mortal Kombat head designer and comic book writer <a href=\"/john-tobias/4040-58303/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-58303\">John Tobias.</a> Jade first appears in the second installment of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II released in 1993, but her role would be as a secret non playable character, and she would share a character palette and leotard costume style with the characters Kitana and Mileena, each female fighter distinguished by a signature color. Jade would be identified with green, Mileena purple and Kitana blue.</p><p>Jade's likeliness would be inspired by Katalin Zamiar initially and Becky Gable in later Mortal Kombat games. With greater memory limits Jade would develop greater visual differences from Kitana and Mileena. Jade would be voiced by Linda Lee. Mortal Kombat would eventually expand into the comic book medium, published by <a href=\"/malibu/4010-447/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-447\">Malibu,</a> Jade would first appear in the comic medium in <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-battlewave/4050-20111/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20111\">Mortal Kombat Battlewave #2</a> released in 1995. Jade would also appear in the Mortal Kombat Rayden and Kano mini series.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Although arguably not as popular or iconic as her Mortal Kombat companions Kitana or <a href=\"/sonya-blade/4005-47818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47818\">Sonya Blade,</a> Jade otherwise is one of the franchises most popular and recognizable characters, and one of its characters that has appeared in various mediums, video games, movies, novels and comic books. Jade first appeared as a secret background character in Mortal Kombat II, it was not until later games that she would become a playable character with her own story.</p><p>Jade would initially be visually identical to characters Kitana and Jade save for wearing a green skin tight body suit and appearing to have a tanner skin tone. A part of Jade's popularity would owe in parts to the characters sex appeal, a trait played up when the character would appear in a Girls Gone Wired promotion.</p><p>Jade's depiction in the Malibu published comic books would reflect the characters Mortal Kombat 2 era appearance and style rather than the characters modernized look, and Jade would be partnered with the ninja character <a href=\"/smoke/4005-49424/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49424\">Smoke,</a> a reference to both characters secret character status in Mortal Kombat 2. Jade would otherwise play a minor supporting role in the story arcs.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Jade and Smoke</h3><p>Jade and Smoke would be acting under service of Shao Kahn, acting as his top assassins. When <a href=\"/goro/4005-15719/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15719\">Goro</a> would return after his defeat in the first Tournament he would seek vengeance by targeting Earth Realm warriors and severely beating them. His victim would be the US Special Forces agent <a href=\"/jax/4005-49164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49164\">Jax.</a> Jax would survive Goros attack but require hospitalization and it was during this period that Shao Kahn would order his assassination by the hands of Jade and Smoke.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Jade is extremely long lived, by virtue of her Edenian physiology. Still considered very young by Edenian standards Jade possesses over ten millennia of life experience and combative fight training. As well as being a superb and skilled hand to hand fighter Jade is also proficient with many manners of weaponry, including steel fans, bo staff and razor-edged boomerangs.</p><h2>Physical Characteristics</h2><p><strong>Height</strong>: 5'7\"<br /><strong>Weight</strong>: 118 lbs<br /><strong>Eyes</strong>: Brown<br /><strong>Hair</strong>: Black<br /><strong>Age</strong>: 10,000 years old</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Movies</h3><h4>Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997)</h4><p>Jade appears in <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-annihilation/4025-147/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-147\">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a> and is played by Irina Pantaeva.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><h4>Mortal Kombat II (1993)</h4><p><b>For Further Information</b>: <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat-ii/61-3571/\">Mortal Kombat II</a></p><p>Jade's first appearance comes in the sequel to the successful Mortal Kombat game Mortal Kombat II.

    "description": "<p>Creation</p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><p>Lamentâs past is kept in mystery by her own choosing, although she has revealed that her true name is Sarah Walks Unseen. Sarah is a young woman of the First Nations Peoples, and also an Ultra. When asked about the origins of her ultra-abilities, told a story about an old Native American belief that if you wanted a child to be a great runner. She stated in the story that they sliced open a rabbitâs torso and place the young infant inside to âabsorb the creatureâs lamentâ and take on the characteristics of that animal. Sarah stated that something similar was done with her, only with a hi-tech security system. Now, Lament has the ability to go into âstealth modeâ and avoid detection, an uncanny natural ability to manipulate computers and a powerful form of telekinesis.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5693511\" data-img-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5693511-img_9103.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.74259681093394\" data-width=\"439\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 439px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.3%\" href=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5693511-img_9103.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5693511\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5693511-img_9103.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5693511-img_9103.jpg 439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" data-width=\"439\"></a></figure><p>Lamentâs mother hoped that her powers would be used for good, calling them âhealing hands.â Sarah, however, found it far easier to hurt others than help them. She became a bounty hunter until the career caused her to burn out and join the Ultraforce. Her somewhat extreme measures led the Black Knight to boot her from the group and Sarah returned home to find out that her mother was critically ill. With her motherâs consent, Sarah ended the womanâs life, using her powers to kill for the last time. Lament has since taken a vow never to kill with her powers again.</p><p>After the event known as \"<a title=\"Black September (comics)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_(comics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black September</a>\" (when <a title=\"Marvel Comics\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel Comics</a> purchased Malibu), the Ultraforce was re-created into a new team. <a title=\"Lament (comcis) (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lament_(comcis)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lamen</a>t was introduced as a new member while Marvel's <a title=\"Black Knight (Dane Whitman)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_(Dane_Whitman)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Knight</a> became the leader of the new group. Although difficult at first in dealing with the new leadership in the team, Lament would soon turn away from her untrusting ways. The Black Knight's previous experience with the Avengers had made him a hardened leader and fighter. Soon Lament and the rest of the Ultraforce members would become a dynamic fighting unit.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Lament is a young Ultra who can become invisible and telekinetically control her victims biological functions.</p>",

He and some of his gorilla brethren were guests in her home for some time.</p><p>(Tolifhar can be identified from amongst his white gorilla brethren as the one with a scarred left eye.)</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Tolifhar was created by <a href=\"/gail-simone/4040-41294/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41294\">Gail Simone</a> and first appeared in 2008's <a href=\"/wonder-woman-14-the-circle-part-one-of-four-what-y/4000-117754/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-117754\">Wonder Woman #14</a>.</p><h2>Alternate Earths</h2><h3>Earth-16</h3><p>In <a href=\"/young-justice/4050-38466/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38466\">Young Justice</a>, Tolifhar made a brief appearance. He was originally an inhabitant of the <a href=\"/africa/4020-56944/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56944\">African</a> country of Bwunda, until a group of scientists arrived to conduct experiments on the indigenous gorillas. Tolifhar was one of the first to be captured, and his brain was replaced with that of one of the scientists, creating the <a href=\"/ultra-humanite/4005-10993/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10993\">Ultra-Humanite</a> and effectively killing Tolifhar.</p><p><a href=\"/nzame/4005-55180/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55180\">Nzame</a> was Tolifhar's son in this continuity.</p>",

    "deck": "A man with power over peoples minds who wanted to trade places with Spawn and become the new Hellspawn so as to avoid the tortures of hell since he found out he was dying.",
    "description": "<p>Mark was the leader of a house full of runaways who discovered that he had a hypnotic power over people. This however came at price. Mark had begun practicing witchcraft and the Black Arts at a young age claiming to have been reading books about the subject since he was in preschool. </p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>ReneÃ©</h2><p> </p><p> ReneÃ© was a young runaway who was searching for a place to stay when she found out about Mark's house. When her friend introduced her to him he was in the mall using his powers to get money with his gang, who called him The Gate-Keeper, and was looking for a new member. Since her friend Ricky had recently left she thought a spot might be open. When ReneÃ© asked to join them he put her through an initiation. He placed a cigarette between their arms and told her if she flinched before it burnt out she would not be accepted. ReneÃ© accepted but she moved before it burnt out and she was forced to leave as Mark taunted her for her \"weakness.\" Once home Mark performed a satanic ritual.</p><p> Later Mark left to a club which he used his powers to get into, once inside however he is assaulted. Instead of fighting him however Mark uses his powers to force the man into thinking there were worms coming out from his mouth and forced into a state of shock as he begged for help. As Mark walked around the club he finds ReneÃ© attempting to get drugs and tells her that he now believes her strong enough to join and invites her to the house.</p><p> Once there he gives ReneÃ© a drug called Laudanum. Soon however the drug makes her want to puke and she runs into the next room where she finds Ricky's body sealed in a bag, then Mark captures ReneÃ©. Soon Mark is performing yet another ritual to \"attract somethone\". Then <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3381\" href=\"/spawn/4005-3381/\" slug=\"spawn\">Spawn</a> appears and attacks Mark throwing him into the room where ReneÃ© is in. When Spawn tries to free her Mark binds him when he ignites a special pentagram sealing him with the elements, blood and Black Cat Bone. There he offers Spawn a deal. He claimed that during his studies he found a ritual   that would allow him to switch places with a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49039\" href=\"/hellspawn/4060-49039/\" slug=\"hellspawn\">Hellspawn</a>, \"Cross-Substantiation\". The ritual however requires a human sacrifice.... Unfortunately for her,  that is what ReneÃ© was for.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>A Deal, A Tower, &amp; A Death</h2><p> As Mark tells him of the plan Spawn thinks of the possibility of becoming human again and growing old with his wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3394\" href=\"/wanda-fitzgerald/4005-3394/\" slug=\"wanda-fitzgerald\">Wanda Fitzgerald</a>, Spawn snaps out of the thought and asks Mark not to do it. When Mark refuses Spawn uses his powers to send he and Mark to his own <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\" href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" slug=\"hell\">Hell</a>. As they walk through Mark's Hell Spawn tells him about each persons own hell and they see the terrors of his Hell. Mark however actually enjoys it and then tells Spawn that he has a cancerous tumor and that he is going to die and that no matter what he does he's going to Hell either way. When Mark tells him this Spawn directs to a tower. As they head to the tower Mark sees people in cages including ReneÃ©, Spawn points out that they're his sins then lets out ReneÃ© and tells her to leave and never return. </p> <p>As they reach the tower they are stopped by a real gatekeeper who asks to see the stamp. Without hesitation mark shows the demon his pentagram tattoo and enters the tower. Spawn taunts Mark with an initiation like the one Mark gave ReneÃ© telling him to climb the steps of the tower and get to the top without screaming or the darkness would consume him. As Mark climbs the steps he starts to burn from his feet up and the flames crawl higher the farther he goes. On his way up demons taunt him telling him to go back and then Mark is completely engulfed by the flames when suddenly he reaches the top and Spawn tells him the fire cured him and instructs him to look at the view and Mark sees the true face of Hell. A black cat appears and offers him crown of thorns, when Spawn asks him to leave ark refuses and then the tower starts to fall apart sending Mark falling to demons below. When Mark awakens his back has been pierced by the pitchfork of a statue and realizes the whole thing was an illusion and that he'd fallen off the top of his house. As he watches Spawn staring down on him the paramedics try to save him but he is reported dead the scene. The paramedics then go to help ReneÃ© and she tells them to take her home as she stares up at spawn who disappears into the night. </p><p> Later Spawn goes to Hell to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4957\" href=\"/malebolgia/4005-4957/\" slug=\"malebolgia\">Malebolgia</a> Mark confronted Spawn blaming him for his current life but Spawn replied to him....\"you did this to yourself.\"</p>",

Like his mother, Wes was gifted with drawing and other art forms and like most kids his age, he found out he was really good drawing comic book characters. Following several adventures dealing with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3365\" href=\"/spider-girl/4005-3365/\" slug=\"spider-girl\">Spider-girl</a> at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55690\" href=\"/midtown-high-school/4020-55690/\" slug=\"midtown-high-school\">Midtown High</a>'s doorstep, Jimmy and Wes decided to create their own independent Spider-girl comic book. Making Spider-girl more of a blonde bombshell who got her powers from aliens the book became an underground hit and the two decided to sell it. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-73702\" href=\"/heather-noble/4005-73702/\" slug=\"heather-noble\">Heather Noble</a> posed as \"Spider-girl\" from the comic but was attacked by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\" href=\"/hobgoblin/4005-7605/\" slug=\"hobgoblin\">Hobgoblin</a> who intended to use Heather to lure the real Spider-girl out. The plan worked but Spider-girl was able to rescue Heather from the Hobgoblin. Following the fight, the book was shut down due to Wes and Jimmy feeling that they attracted the wrong attention.</p><p>It was revealed that Wes had a crush on May for a while and he hoped May would see him as more than a friend. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3369\" href=\"/davida-kirby/4005-3369/\" slug=\"davida-kirby\">Davida Kirby</a> dated Wes briefly in an attempt to push May and Wes together. After Wes found out about <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44681\" href=\"/gene-thompson/4005-44681/\" slug=\"gene-thompson\">Gene Thompson</a> smear campaign against May. He faced him before Gene punched him, telling him not to tell anyone. Eventually May came after Gene after he had beaten up Wes and ended up revealing by accident what the fight was really about. May broke up with Gene and left him alone on the football field. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48386\" href=\"/fury-the-goblin-queen/4005-48386/\" slug=\"fury-the-goblin-queen\">Fury the Goblin Queen</a> attacked Midtown and kidnapped, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48637\" href=\"/simone-desantos/4005-48637/\" slug=\"simone-desantos\">Simone DeSantos</a> - who was the daughter of the current <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57548\" href=\"/goblin-cult/4060-57548/\" slug=\"goblin-cult\">Cult of the Goblin</a> leader, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70019\" href=\"/rene-desantos/4005-70019/\" slug=\"rene-desantos\">Rene DeSantos</a>. Wes tried to save Simone but Fury knocked him off her <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55762\" href=\"/goblin-glider/4055-55762/\" slug=\"goblin-glider\">glider</a>. Spider-Girl was able to use her powers to catch Wes but without her web-shooters, had to use various tricks for them to land safely, dislocated her shoulder in the process. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\" href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\" slug=\"kaine\">Kaine</a> popped her shoulder back in place, Wes was sick before he was brought to the paramedics to be checked on. Thanks to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61776\" href=\"/mayhem/4005-61776/\" slug=\"mayhem\">April</a>, Wes is starting to fall for May hard, while she is unsure about her feelings for him. During all of this, Wes figured out that May was really Spider-Girl and was debating about telling her that he knew. Following the loss of April, Wes finally came clean with May and she was more than happy that he knew and the two soon kissed and started dating afterwards.</p>",

When Grimm sat down a mechanism lowered him into their secret base.

He was preparing to order them to tunnel directly under Paris, destroying the city. The Thing, moved by memories of \"the good old days\" when you knew who the heroes were and all they had to do was go beat the tar out of a bad guy, agreed to help. </p> <p>They battled past the rock monsters, le Vent used his super-speed to send the Thing flying directly to l'Empereur's tunneler. He destroys the machine, and causes a powerful explosion which triggers a cave in.

She takes him back due to his dedication and agrees to marry him.</p><a href=\"///\"></a> <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2> <p>Adamantine's powers were poorly-defined, but he seems to posses flight, super-strength and durability, as well as skill in disguise.</p>",

    "deck": "Baraka is one of the most vicious warriors in the MK-Verse. He belongs to a race called the Tarkata, a crossbread between demons of the Netherealm and denizens of Outworld. He possesses long blades from his forarms that slice through his opponents. He fights for those he call \"master\".",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Baraka was first introduced in the comics as a \"Brawn over brains\" type of character that speaks in pidgin english, his one line in the Mortal Kombat II book was \"Baraka show Cage pain!\". In the video games he is commonly depicted as a more intelligent creature that is also an effective leader he is also very arrogant and vicious.</p><p>As a Tarkatan he is a crossbread of <a href=\"/demons/4015-52203/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-52203\">demons</a> from the Netherealms and <a href=\"/outworld/4020-55787/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55787\">Outworld</a> Denizens, like the rest of his kind he has retractable blades protruding from his forearms and is likely to be found roaming the wastelands of Outland while following a powerful leader who can lead his race to victory.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Storyline</h2><p>Baraka was recruited by the Emperor of Outworld <a href=\"/shao-kahn/4005-49430/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49430\">Shao Khan</a>, to lead an assault on the Shaolin Temple of Light in Earthrealm which killed many monks in the process. This enraged<a href=\"/liu-kang/4005-47119/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47119\"> Liu Kang</a> and <a href=\"/kung-lao/4005-49422/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49422\">Kung Lao</a> who traveled to Outworld to defeat Khan. After Shao Khan's defeat, Baraka was sent away to the lowerlands of Outworld. He would then leave Outworld and travel alone.</p><p>Sometime later, while wandering through <a href=\"/rain/4005-53822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53822\">Edenia</a>, he would encounter the sorcerer <a href=\"/quan-chi/4005-53257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53257\">Quan Chi</a> who offered him to rule the realms at his side if he joins <a href=\"/shinnok/4005-53469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53469\">Shinnok</a>'s army. Eager for battle, he acceptes.</p><p>After Shinnok's defeat, Baraka and his tarkatan hord found thereselves again leaderless, until the former ruler of Outworld Onaga returned and sought to rule the realm. Baraka, having faith in the<a href=\"/dragon-king/4005-53310/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53310\"> Dragon King</a>'s strength, saw him as his new master, and led his takatan hord in battle against the forces of Light and anyone who resisted his rule. Baraka would free his old ally Mileena and recruit her to Onaga's ranks. She posed as her sister <a href=\"/kitana/4005-49353/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49353\"> Princess Kitana</a>, using her position to misdirect the Edenian forces into combat against the Tarkatan raiding parties well away from Onaga. This was intended to give the Dragon King the time he needed to complete his schemes. However she gave command of Kitana's army to Bo' Rai Cho. His forces have defeated many Tarkatans and Bo'Rai Chi himself defeated Baraka, which angered him. Although<a href=\"/mileena/4005-49416/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49416\"> Mileena</a> agreed to meet him in the Beetle Lair, Baraka, knowing she would ambush him, decided to send another Tarkatan in his place. As Baraka predicted, Mileena had ambushed and killed the tarkatan. While making her way back from the Beetle lair, she was ambushed by a vengeful Baraka.</p><p>During the Armageddon Arc, if Baraka defeats Blaze, he acquires ultimate power, and decides to never serve anyone again and to rule the Realms. He confronts his old masters Onaga and Shao Khan and threaten them to bow before him or die. They reply by attacking him but this proves as unsucessful, as he stabs them both in their heart with his blades which have grown to twice their natural size. He offers Mileena to be his Queen. She presumably acceptes.</p><p> </p><h2>Characteristics</h2><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'5\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 220 lbs</li><li><b>Nationality:</b> Outworlder</li><li><b>Martial Art:</b> Silat, Hung Gar</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Special Moves</h2><p> </p><p>Flying Shard - Baraka launches a spike to the opponent.</p><p> </p><p>Head Swipe - Baraka swipes the opponent quick and hard at the head.</p><p> </p><p>Blade Spin - Baraka would spin around like a top toy and making his blades grow longer he hurts the opponent.</p><p> </p><p>Blade Fury/Chop Chop - Blades Baraka continually swipes the opponent vertically.</p><p> </p><p>Mutant Blades - Baraka charges at the opponent with both blades pointing towards to strike the opponent.</p><p> </p><h2>Fatalities</h2><p>Decapitation - Baraka decapitates the opponent with one swing to the head with his blade.</p><p>Blade Lift - Baraka stabs the opponent in the stomach with both blades and lifts the rival up, The opponent screams before dying and finally Baraka goes mad and slices te opponent into pieces.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Video Games</h3><ul><li>Mortal Kombat II</li><li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat</li><li>Mortal Kombat Trilogy</li><li>Mortal Kombat Gold</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Deception</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Unchained</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</li><li>Mortal Kombat 2011</li><li>Mortal Kombat Vs.

Not dissuaded, Felicity started looking through old news reports involving Spider-man, and came across an article that showed Spider-man fighting crime along side another spider powered individual, the <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Spider</a>. Spider-Girl tried her best to prevent her from following her, but Felicity repeatedly tried to help her, often putting her own life in danger. Despite her best efforts, Spider-Girl found herself working with the new Scarlet Spider on more than one occasion (which resulted in near death situations). Eventually Felicia found out what her daughter had done, and confronted her. Felicity asked her mother if she was angry because she became a hero, or because she hadn't patterned herself after the Black Cat. However, after a near death experience fighting <a href=\"../../kaine/29-8667/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaine</a>, Felicity finally retired as the Scarlet Spider.</p><p>Later on her father Flash Thompson was about to lose his job as the basketball coach of Spider-Girl's high school, Felicity sought out her \"mentor's\" help once again, asking May to rejoin the basketball team. May refused, saying that using her powers on the basketball court was the same as cheating, so the team loss the game and Flash lost his job. When she learned that the Cult of <a href=\"../../scriers/65-7115/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scriers</a> was out to kill Spider-Girl, Felicity became Scarlet Spider again to help her, but was almost killed by a Scrier. Felicity swore that she would hang up her mask, but it is likely that when given the opportunity, she will become Scarlet Spider again. Felicity returned in Amazing Spider-Girl recently, offering to help May through her computer skills.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Skills</h3><p>Felicity is skilled in gymmastics, martial arts, and is great with computers.</p><h3>Intellect</h3><p>Her greatest ability is her investigative skill.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As Scarlet Spider, Felicity supplements her agility and fighting skills with \"web-shooters\" that can fire smoke bombs and sonic blasts (which she calls her \"Scarlet Screamer\"). Her primary weapon is a high-tech Cat o' nine tails whip (which she calls her \"Scarlet O'Nine tails\") that has extendable tendrils that can entangle her enemies like a web.</p>",

When he is with his brothers he always takes charge. Vandalizer despises <a href=\"/violator/4005-3390/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3390\"> Violator</a> more than any of his brothers. He believes that he is the strongest and could easily destroy Violator. However, every chance he tries he ends up failing. Violator always proves himself more superior, but it never stops Vandalizer from trying to kill his older brother. Vandalizer is also fifty-one years younger than Violator is.</p><h2>Creation </h2><p>Vandilizer is created by Bart Sears and Alan Moore, he first appeared in Violator #1.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Rank &amp; Role</h2><p>As the captain of the Pirate Club, John is in charge of recruiting members, holding meetings and strategically conquering new territories from rival clubs.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Characteristics</h2><p>John's obsession is to become a true pirate of the high seas. As ruthless and cold hearted as they come, John is always looking to profit in the name of the Pirate Club, no matter what misfortune that may mean for rival clubs of Blackhawk Delta. John moved one step closer to becoming a true pirate when his left eye was shot out (earning him an eyepatch) by a ricocheting bullet fired from Officer Reilly's gun.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>In terms of typical powers John essentially has none -- at least not in the real world. Though in the final issue of Volume 1 John was able to use his imagination in the North Pole to conjure a shark for one attack which resulted in Santa Claus receiving a devastating neck wound. Although it is known that this power was a result of John's impeccable imagination, it appears these powers were only possible in the North Pole because of its association with imagination and magic.</p>",

    "deck": "A warrior prince who has been cursed to hunt down and slay the old gods, one by one.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Bairn's origin as the Godslayer is shrouded in mystery. He is known to be a warrior prince who hails from Endra-la, the kingdom isle. During one of his many conquests, a naval battle ensues, at which point the warrior is mortally wounded and is subsequently thrown overboard. As his body slowy sinks to the murky depths, dying, he can think of only one thing, to be reunited with his great love, Neva. It is in his final dying moments that his cries for salvation are answered by a faceless, voiceless entity, projecting thoughts, images and alien dreams into his mind.</p><blockquote><p>\"Save me. Let me return to my love. I will promise you anything.\"</p></blockquote><p>He knew what this dark master asked of him, and accepted, with the condition that he would one day be brought back to her. And thus the Godslayer was born, destined to traverse the earth undead and hunt godlings. Unsatiable, unyeilding and ultimately unstoppable.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><p>Word of a mysterious marauder bound by no flag, first reaches six of the thirteen Arcadean gods, the remaining members of this pantheon are elsewhere. A message from Tybalt, their messenger, that Llyra of the four hundred graces has been slain, insights little intrigue among the few.</p><p>Next we see Neva recounting her death at the hands of her beloved Bairn, after she had become a vessel for the goddess Llyra, believing him dead. She stands and cries for attention, aloft his ship of black sails, but to no avail. He stands, solemn, motionless and makes no such gesture towards her as they near his darkened stronghold. He carries the burning spear of Llyra while she is quick to follow. The relic is dispatched within a wall of webbing and hands, holding many other ancient artifacts. Suddenly Bairn momentarily lapses from his unrelenting apathy, only to bellow his loss of Neva, his beloved, who died by his hand.</p><p>Neva is revealed to be but an apparition/phantom, a figment of his imagination, as he requires the nepenthe wine to remedy these haunting visions of that which he has lost, but they do no such thing. Instead she becomes visible as he attempts to quell his depression. As she becomes more tangible she still pines for his gaze, and by knocking the chalice of nepenthe from his hands, she is granted her wish, but also fractures the face of a mirror, from which a horde of headless creatures swarm forth.</p><p>Outnumbered the outcome seems obvious, until the remnants of the light of Llyra flow through Neva and aid Bairn in destroying this army. During the brief reprieve they have, Bairn explains to Neva that he was returned to her by his dark master, true to his word, while she was possessed by the goddess Llyra, only to destroy her and continue on with his quest, or as he calls it \"an endless, waking nightmare.\" She reveals to him it has been at least 40 years since his demise and rebirth.</p><p>He is still confused as to whether or not this spirit of Neva is real, and is subsequently summoned by his master, having to endure unspeakable pain and suffering as his mind is purged of memory and remade, continuously. Now filled only with dark thoughts and dark information, the orders had been given. He emerges from a secret chamber with but one thought, to battle. Head raised, he envisages his quarry, the next god he must kill, Urshrek, the winter king.</p><p>He travels a great many miles and comes across a stranger, Dromo, who wishes to accompany him to a great tower which stems from Mount Nilfrost. It is the home of the winter king. His intention swift, the sword of Godslayer brings Urshrek to the brink of life, but it is not enough. The lord of frost and withering renews himself by feeding upon the unfortunate souls by whom he is revered. The size of the beast increases, as the cold god becomes more a giant in comparison. All hope of defeating this cannibalistic fiend soon diminishes as the ever enduring warrior is easily swept aside. However, his purpose still remains, and although the cold has set his bones and battle aches his weary soul, the deed must be done. Bloodlust still overpowers any other sensation. With a sensational roar Urshrek summons glacier-like blades which draw forth from the snow, creating a forest of ice stalagmites, making further difficulty for the Godslayer. His mind still seared with dark thoughts and motivations, 'til the end shall he battle, 'til one stands and the other does not, 'til death. He deciphers that for all the strength of this monolithic god, it is but an animal who feeds and fights when the time does call for it, a characteristic they both have in common.</p><p>Valiant efforts put forth from Bairn, but once again he is cast down by a mighty blow from the ever angered god. As Urshrek stands over the fallen warrior, beneath it's cloak shadows do stir and contort, pulling him within and with that he seemingly vanishes from this plane. Dromo, meanwhile, walks a city in the shadow of Mount Nilfrost, through scores of recently deceased, whom have been devoured by their wrathful god, to sustain his might. Urshrek's appetite now sated, the beast slumbers, and it is revealed that within the dark amuelt around its neck, Bairn is sealed. But from this perspective it does not appear a prison, but a paradise, where the waters are clear and the skies are endless. Upon awakening he drinks from the stream and is greeted by jorren, a humanoid creatures of sorts, and welcomed to the blissful life which now beholds him. The Godslayer is unsettled by the peacefulness of it all, and at first cannot believe what is happening after such tribulations, has he finally found peace? Time begins to blur as do the days, still Bairn is discomforted by constant nightmares and horrid dreams.</p><p>At this point Dromo, sifting through snow t'ward Mount Nilfrost, refers to Bairn as Elyar, and retrieves his dark sword, which had been flung during the skirmish, from a nearby tree, assuming his friend will require it.</p><p>Still not at ease in paradise, Bairn is now hounded by the thought of what unfinished business revived him, and the deadly bargain that therein lies. He dreamed another horrible dream, this time, one far more close to home, about his beloved Neva, her ghostly presence damns him for once again abandoning her as he promised he never would. This stirs the Godslayer from apathy and to question what happenings have brought him to this 'heaven' is he once again dead? While staring at his reflection in the lake and seeing his darkest form peer back at him he is reminded of a tree he layed eyes upon when first entering this place. One half was rife with life and the other dead and twisted, two sides to one coin as it were, or more importantly, two faces to one entity. Two faces of one god. Bairn, now fully ensconced in his armour, walks up to Jorren, blissfully unaware of what is about to transipre. He molds his hand and gauntlet to become a weapon, and drives it through the unsuspecting Jorren. As this occurs his headdress falls and an identical amulet to that worn round the neck of Urshrek is clearly visible.</p><p>In the real world Urshrek's amulet now shatters and causes considerable agony to the 'twin god,' one half of him now broken, he is vulnerable. The beast flails in both temper and pain, until setting sights on that which causes its grief, it will take the Godslayer as well. Luckily, Dromo happens upon the chaos and gives Bairn his sword, just in time for winter king to be driven through and his body relinquishes the energy comparable to \"a thousand thunder storms,\" and the cannibal god's prisoners. True to form the Godslayer has done his duty. The tower begins to collpase and the duo make their leave, only to land on an iceberg, drifting down a cold river and into the mist.</p><p>The horizon beckons, until a dark familiar shadow of a ship comes into view, and upon it, stands Neva, who appears revived, and to have made a similar convenant as she wears an armour that resembles his. She tells Bairn it is time for them to journey back to their home land of Endra-La, where they must collect her bones.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Lucas Ottoman is a writer for the <em>New York Times</em>.  He writes a lot about <a href=\"/hunter-rose/4005-31944/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31944\">Grendel</a>.  He is also having a secret affair with the police detective in charge of their Grendel investigation, <a href=\"/detective-elizabeth-sparks/4005-49531/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49531\">Elizabeth Sparks</a>.  By day they exchange professional banter in front of the other police, as he asks for news tips. A night they talk frankly about their difficulties in learning anything about the city's masked criminal.</p><p>Ottoman talks to a lot of everyday people near to the case, like the maids and concierge in the hotel where Grendel killed some mobsters, but he's not getting any real information.  Finally he hears that there will be a big illegal deal on the docks, so he goes over to check it out.  He is stunned, and terrified, to find Grendel in a battle with <a href=\"/argent/4005-29994/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29994\">Argent</a>.  Argent ends up killing a bunch of street thugs in a bloody massacre, and Lucas freaks out.  He loses some of his respect for the police, since they condone his violent activities.  He and Liz start to have some tension over this issue.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2951335\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2951335-scan+24.jpeg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.59587628865979\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2951335-scan+24.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2951335\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2951335-scan+24.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2951335-scan+24.jpeg 970w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/104794/2951335-scan+24.jpeg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2951335-scan+24.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Lucas does some more investigating, and suddenly realizes, based on the clues he's found, that Grendel could be Hunter Rose!  He is the only person, other than <a href=\"/larry-stohler/4005-49532/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49532\">Larry Stohler</a>, to figure this out.  Now he's scared.  What does he do with this knowledge?  How can he prove his hunch?</p><p>He does more research.  He doesn't want to tell Liz because he's not sure, but she's starting to distrust him, because she can tell his hiding something.  Finally she confronts him in his apartment, where he has a bunch of surveillance equipment sitting out.  He still evades her questions.  Later, they reconcile.</p><p>Lucas finally finds someone who saw Grendel turn a walking stick into his forked weapon.  Knowing that Hunter Rose uses a walking stick, Lucas decides he has enough evidence and decides to go to the police.  First he goes home to get his evidence.  Unfortunately Hunter is waiting for him.  He knew Lucas had been talking to his various associates, and figured out that Lucas knew his identity.  Hunter kills him and burns down his building.  Liz Sparks comes in the apartment just as Grendel was leaving and was burned badly in the fire as well.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Character History</h2><p>Larry Stohler was originally just a high-society gossip.  He often saw <a href=\"/hunter-rose/4005-31944/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31944\">Hunter Rose</a>, and they often joked together, poking fun at each other and the rest of posh society. However, he once attended a party in which Rose, in his guise as Grendel, poisoned <a href=\"/barry-palumbo/4005-87309/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87309\">Barry Palumbo</a> and briefly took Barry's niece, <a href=\"/stacy-palumbo/4005-23028/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23028\">Stacy</a>. Rose was missing from the party for some time.  He worried that his absence would be noticed, and that people would figure out that he was Grendel.</p><p>However, while Larry Stohler did in fact figure out exactly that, he decided to help him instead of expose him. He misdirected the others at the party so Rose's absence wasn't missed. Later, he told Grendel what he had done. Grendel would normally have killed someone who put him in such a vulnerable position, but he liked Larry's cheek, and instead made him his assistant.</p><p>From then on, Stohler was an invaluable help to Grendel. He provided him with society information, and also helped to coordinate his criminal empire.  For instance, once he elicited secret information from a Bolivian man who was smuggling drugs into town without giving Grendel his cut by pretending to be a debauched rich man looking to score some of his cocaine.  He was also Rose's right-hand man when it came to Stacy; he was, absurdly, the only guest at her birthday party, and looked after her when Hunter went out as Grendel right afterwards.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2827185-letter_3.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2827185\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"2.5666074600355\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:256.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2827185-letter_3.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2827185\"><img alt=\"Hunter and Larry run their criminal empire\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/2827185-letter_3.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2827185-letter_3.jpeg 563w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/2827185-letter_3.jpeg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/2827185-letter_3.jpeg 249w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px\" data-width=\"249\"></a><figcaption>Hunter and Larry run their criminal empire</figcaption></figure><p>While Grendel was still beginning to control the city's crime families, Rose had a crisis of self-confidence; unbeknownst to him, he was being tracked by a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dire-imp/4005-88368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88368\">Dire-Imp</a>, and he had an eerie feeling of being watched that led to a feeling of worry in everything he did. Stohler noticed, and while he continued to provide good advice to Rose about how to help consolidate his power, he began to worry about his boss. He helped Rose make their plans against an especially troublesome Korean syndicate. After that problem was solved, Hunter met the demon, which showed him the future, including how the spirit of Grendel would take over the world. Hunter wrote about it all in his journals. Angered by the whole affair, he then tossed the journal pages in the fire. Stohler then secretly grabbed the papers out of the fire and kept them.</p><p>Sometimes he took a more direct hand in criminal matters.  Once he poisoned a stoolie after he passed false information to the police for them.</p><p>He was especially involved in the Seaboard Massacre, in which Grendel had all his rival crimelords assassinated. Stohler traveled around the country spying on them, and provided Rose with important information on their activities. He also helped Rose tape his taunting call about the massacre to the police--a call that was overheard by Stacy Palumbo, and which ultimately led to Rose's downfall.</p><p>When Stacy later tricked <a href=\"/argent/4005-29994/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29994\">Argent</a> into thinking that she had been kidnapped by Grendel and sent a message to Rose saying that he wanted to meet, it was Larry that gave Grendel the message.</p><p>When Grendel was killed, Larry read and burned his missing journal pages about the demon and its prophecy of Grendel's future world domination. Because the pages were burned, the world would have no warning of its dire future. The police soon showed up at his door, and Stohler killed himself with a pistol.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><p>In the <a href=\"/batmangrendel-devils-riddle/4050-21213/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21213\">Batman/Grendel</a> crossover <i>Devil's Riddle/Devil's Masque</i>, Larry is once again seen as Grendel's able right-hand man. He provides Hunter with travel arrangements, finds information on <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> and his rogue's gallery, easily elicits classified information from Lloyd's of London, and arranges the kidnapping of a young child.</p>",

Though perhaps only his imagination, Bearclaw is able to call upon the strength of the bear to deliver bone crushing blows to the kids of rival clubs. </p><p>In the final issue of Volume 1, Bearclaw was able to use his imagination in the North Pole to grow the fangs and claws of a bear in the final battle.

The plague killed the Ragu parents and left Elle (then eight years old) critically ill. So Dias gave up his valle training to hire out as a mercenary in the Kurudan army in order to earn money for Elle's medicines and foster care. During this time, he became friends with Scarface, Kai Sink, and Kain Phalanx. He is introduced in the TV series as living a solitary life as a master smith for weapons in a ghost town called Prorathan (Blorahan), and under the shadow of a wasting disease. Elle loves him dearly, even if she rarely gets to see him; and the feeling is mutual, as he adopts Gau and confides in the younger man his concerns for his baby sister.</p>",

From the very beginning, he shows a great interest in Elle and her adopted brother Gau, acting as a sort of unofficial \"uncle\" to both Gau and Screb Lowengren when the two begin to cross each others' paths. Together with Dias Ragu, Kai Sink, and Kain Phalanx, they were Kuruda's most fearsome warriors during previous Soulfan wars.

Ikkaku doesn't wear the white Tabi socks with his sandals however, but he does wear the straw sandals still. Ikkaku is completely bald with a shiny gleam to it. Ikkaku also has these thin red markings at the edge of his eyes which make him look like he is wearing make- up.<br/><br/>Ikkaku Madarame is a very violent and out spoken character. He tends to talk a lot when he is trying to start a fight and will laugh at his opponent when he is in the fight. Ikkaku is also a very brash person, liking to start a fight regardless of how little he might know about his adversary. Ikkaku is also a loner when in battle. He has asked <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47125\" href=\"/yumichika-ayasegawa/4005-47125/\" slug=\"yumichika-ayasegawa\">      Yumichika Ayasegawa</a> to step back and let him fight alone and refused to fight an Arrancar at one point because he liked to fight alone. Ikkaku is also very loyal, continuing to serve <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42566\" href=\"/kenpachi/4005-42566/\" slug=\"kenpachi\">     Kenpachi</a> even when he has the ability to get promoted to Captain or Vice Captain levels.<br/><br/><br/> <h2>History</h2><br/> <h3>Soul Society Arc</h3><br/>When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\" href=\"/ichigo/4005-42468/\" slug=\"ichigo\">    Ichigo</a> and the group arrive in the Soul Society Ikkaku is the first to find Ichigo as him and Yumichika stumble across Ichigo and Ganju. Ikkaku attacks Ichigo viciously and trades blows with him before he has to use his secret salve that he keeps in the hilt of his zanpakuto. Ikkaku begins to lecture Ichigo on how a warrior should fight and even drives Ichigo back. Eventually Ikakku releases his Zanpakuto and looks as if he might be ready to finish the battle quickly, unfortunately Ichigo starts using his full powers and ends up defeating Ikkaku. When Ikkaku awakens he is surprised to find that he is still alive and begins to warn Ichigo that Kenpachi will be hunting him now too. Ikkaku is taken to a hospital to be treated for his wounds and is interrogated by Captain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55538\" href=\"/mayuri-kurotsuchi/4005-55538/\" slug=\"mayuri-kurotsuchi\">   Mayuri Kurotsuchi</a>. Ikkaku holds out in the face of being killed until Kenpachi arrives and runs off Kurotsuchi. Ikkaku give Kenpachi a description of Ichigo and where he is headed. Ikkakku eventually heals and joins back up with Kenpachi when all hell breaks loose in the Soul Society.<br/><br/> <h3>Choosing Sides</h3><br/>Towards the end of the Soul Society Storyline Ikkaku and Yumichika join back up with Kenpachi to help Ichigo and the team save Rukai. Ikkaku takes on his long time friend and one time team mate Tetsuzaemon Iba while Kenpachi takes on two of the other Gotei 13 captains and Yumichika takes one of Tosen's lieutenants. Ikkaku and Iba fight like two sparring partners rather than as bitter enemies. It is never shown as to which one wins but the two seem to take the fight light heartedly, pausing to enjoy saki with one another during the fight. They also use paper rock scissors to determine who will take the high grounds at the start of the next fight.<br/><br/> <h3>Arrancar Storyline</h3><br/>When Ichigo and the other humans begin to fight against the Arrancar after they attack the city several of the Soul Society's best warriors are sent to help. Ikkaku and Yamichika are met by Edrad Leones, a large and brutish looking Arrancar. Ikkaku tells Yumichika that he will take the battle and tells him to step back. When the fight starts Ikkaku is surprised that the Arrancar does not use his sword and ends up forcing Edrad to release his sealed Arrancar powers. Edrad proves to be extremely powerful and with his powers unleashed he makes Ikkaku finally reveal that he can access his Bankai.<br/> <p>When Ikkaku finally releases his Banki he stuns Edrad and proves to be very crafty. Eventually Ikkaku and Edrad go head to head for who will win. In the end Ikkaku wins, but in the process he takes some sever injuries that he has to rely on some help when they leave the fight scene to get somewhere to sleep.<br/><br/> </p><h3>Battle for Fake Karakura Town</h3><br/>After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42859\" href=\"/sosuke-aizen/4005-42859/\" slug=\"sosuke-aizen\">  Aizen</a> has revealed his true motives being to attack the inhabitants of Karakura he is welcomed by the remaining Captains in a battle field that they have set up.Â  Inside this battlefield are four towers that keep the real Karakura's people safely hidden in a different dimension.Â  When Baragan tries to send several Menos to attack the towers Ikkaku and several of the Gotei 13's best seated officers attack and defend the towers.Â  When Baragan sees his first plan stopped he sends in four of his best fraccions after the officers.Â  Ikkaku is forced to face off with Po, a large arrancar that doesn't say too much at first.Â  As each of the other officers dispatch their enemies only Ikkaku is left, and he lsoes.Â  As a large part of his tower is sent crumbling in to the gake city Ikkaku gets back to his feet in time to see Iba and Captain Sajin face save the tower.Â  Captain Sajin finishes the fight using his bankai and crushing Po.Â  After wards Ikkaku is scolded by Iba for being too selfish and not utilizing his own Bankai.Â  Ikkaku starts to defend his actions when Iba tells him he must get stronger so that he can afford to be as stubborn as he likes to be.<br/><br/> <h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><br/>Ikkaku has the basic abilities of most Soul Reapers with the exclusion that he shows no ability to use Kidos. In the series it is discussed as the 11th Division see that the ability to do anything other than fight is not truly being tough. His powers and abilities include: <br/>Â <br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Master Swordsmanship.</li><li><i>Shunpo</i> or Flash steps: Ikkaku is a proficient shunpo user, but only uses it to keep up with very strong opponents.</li><li>High Spiritual Power.</li><li>Enhanced Strength.</li><li>Enhanced Durability.</li><li>Enhanced Endurance.</li><li>Hakuda Expert. <br/></li></ul><br/> <h2>ZanpakutÅ</h2> <p><br/>Ikkaku has a very unique and powerful ZanpakutÅ that plays off his crazed fighting style rather well. HÅzukimaru is plain looking in it's sealed form but it does hide a compartment in the end of the hilt that he keeps a clotting salve in. Ikkaku is ambidextrous and uses his ZanpakutÅ (in it's basic form) in either hand.Â <br/></p> <h3>HÅzukimaru.Â Â <br/></h3> <h3>Shikai<br/></h3> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/902643-hozukimaru_ikkaku.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902643\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/902643-hozukimaru_ikkaku.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902643\"><img alt=\"Shikai form\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/902643-hozukimaru_ikkaku.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/902643-hozukimaru_ikkaku.jpg 640w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/902643-hozukimaru_ikkaku.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Shikai form</figcaption></figure>To transform HÅukimaru Ikkaku presses the end of his hilt against the opening in his sheath and calls forth the release.

When in close Ikkaku can reveal the true power of Hozukimaru by making the spears break into three sections that open at two hidden points.<br/><br/> <p> </p><h3>Bankai<br/></h3> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/902644-ikkaku_bankai.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902644\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/902644-ikkaku_bankai.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902644\"><img alt=\"Bankai form\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/902644-ikkaku_bankai.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/902644-ikkaku_bankai.jpg 640w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/902644-ikkaku_bankai.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bankai form\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/902644-ikkaku_bankai.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/902644-ikkaku_bankai.jpg 640w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/902644-ikkaku_bankai.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bankai form</figcaption></figure>When fully released into it's Bankai, HÅzukimaru becomes Ryumon HÅzukimaru. The appearance is still a three part weapon that has multiple options for battle. In the Bankai form HÅzukimaru turns into two very large swords that have semi- circular blades and larger red tassels in the place of the hand guards. at the back of the hilts is a large chain that runs to a gigantic half circle blade that has an immense handle running between it's two sides. raising across the length of the blade is a dragon that slowly turns red as his Bankai fully releases it's power. When Ikkaku releases his bankai to defeat Edrad he makes mention of the  fact that HÅzukimaru is rather lazy and take a bit before it gets fully  powered.",

She was friends with all her co-workers and due to married to Wayne Tannanger, although they haven't set a date yet.</p><p>Gretchen was on her way to meet a new writer at \"a dive-coffee\" shop but when she arrived she was horrified by seeing <a href=\"/john-mawbley/4005-89619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89619\">John Mawbley</a>, carving the eyes out of the customers in the coffee shop he had just murdered.</p><p>Gretchen takes off running and is hit by a police car a few blocks away, and knocked unconscious. She regains consciousness while being raped by the police and ambulance attendants, where she is beaten unconsciousness again. They deliver her to another serial killer, Jeremiah \"Sharpie\" Eude for disposal. There she is violently murdered by the Sharpie and cut up into hundreds of pieces.</p><p>She is then found and is literally stitched back to life and imbued with special powers by a mysterious gypsy woman, named only Odessa. Gretchen, now calling herself Suture goes after serial killers and rapist.</p><p>She kills Frank Autobahn, a serial killer known as The Postman, by cutting him to pieces then sewing him back together, and leaving him hanging in his home. She then kills Solomon Weaver, the Cargo Killer. Suture then goes after John Mawbley, and kills him just before he tries to kill a movie theater full of families. She cuts him and sews him back together, sewing the eyes he's been collecting into her last creation. This is the first time Suture is seen in her new form by eyewitnesses.</p><p>Suture goes back to Odessa's home to reflect on the deeds she has done then goes to St. Xaveirs Hospital and attacks paramedics Donnello and Forbes, two of the men involved in her death. She removes their gential and leaves them sewn-up from head to toe.</p><p>Suture next victim is Sharpie. She kills him and cuts him up with his own surgical saw. She then sews him back together with metal chains and takes his corpse to the 29th precinct, the head police station of the police men that raped and sent her to her death, There she surrenders to them for the murder of the other serial killers.</p><p>Suture then waits in the 29th precinct untill the rest of the cops who killed her arrive. She then breaks out of her cell and attacks them. She kills the three remaining men responable for her death. She then learns from <a href=\"/sam-burke/4005-3387/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3387\">Sam Burke </a>and <a href=\"/twitch-williams/4005-3388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3388\">Twitch Williams</a> that Wayne is dead. Twitch gives her the ring Wayne gave to him for her and Suture disappears into the dark.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p><span></span></p> <p><span><b>Green Lantern <br/>Status: Active<br/>Space Sector: 2234</b></span><br/><span><b>Sector Partner: Perdoo<br/>Homeworld: </b></span><span><b>Unknown</b></span><br/><span><b>Predecessor: </b></span><span><b>Unknown</b></span><br/><span><b>Successor: Inapplicable</b></span></p> <p><br/></p><p></p><h2>History</h2><p>El'qa Squa Zreenah spent his life fighting against the Statejians. Only when he received a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\" href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" slug=\"green-lantern\">Green Lantern</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">power ring</a> did he realize that their defeat might actually be possible. El-qa Sqa Zreenah was in the midst of a vicious space battle with the Statejians, an alien race which maintained an almost supernatural ability to strategically calculate a battle and anticipate their enemies every move. Outfitted with yellow hulled \"dragonfly\" battleships, the invaders proved too tough for the Green Lantern of Sector 2234. </p> <p>Despite fighting bravely, El-qa Sqa Zreenah was downed by enemy fire and crashed on a nearby planet. He was gravely wounded and believed he would soon be dead. As protocol dictated, he willed his ring to scan the planet for a suitable replacement. </p> <p>However, the planet he landed on was populated by an avian species of easily frightened creatures. When approached by the ring, nearly ever single man, woman, and child on the planet fainted on the spot. The exception was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25390\" href=\"/green-lantern-perdoo/4005-25390/\" slug=\"green-lantern-perdoo\">Perdoo</a>, an inmate in an insane asylum.</p> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/141799-150816-green-lantern-perdoo.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-141799\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.7857142857143\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:178.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/141799-150816-green-lantern-perdoo.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-141799\"><img alt=\"El-qa's unstable partner Perdoo\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/141799-150816-green-lantern-perdoo.gif\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/141799-150816-green-lantern-perdoo.gif 154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px\" data-width=\"154\"></a><figcaption>El-qa's unstable partner Perdoo</figcaption></figure> <p>Perdoo was taken to El-qa Sqa Zreenah by the ring where he barely listened to the Lantern instruct him in the finer points of this sacred duty. Perdoo appeared oddly distracted and detached from reality, however he took the ring and reengaged the enemy in space. </p> <p>Seeing the invaders as nothing more then \"butterflies\" who did not play nicely, Perdoo's unorthodox behavior completely baffled the highly analytical species. As a result, Perdoo easily defeated them without even knowing what had actually occurred. </p> <p>Returning to the planet's surface, Perdoo found that El-qa Sqa Zreenah was not as gravely injured as he had first believed. The senior Lantern retrieved his ring and was soon surprised to find his replacement being carried off by two orderlies who had tracked down Perdoo from the asylum.</p> <p>El-qa Sqa Zreenah would resume his career as a Lantern. Since this encounter, it has been revealed that the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-universe\">Guardians of the Universe</a>Â have granted the gentle Perdoo a ring of his own and a place in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\" href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" slug=\"green-lantern-corps\">Green Lantern Corps</a> asÂ hisÂ partnerÂ inÂ Sector 2234. El'qa takes life extremely seriously and finds little humor, an idea that baffles hisÂ odd partner.</p>",

The H'Gusten were an endangered species threatened by an alien race, the Graaryen. The Graaryen were indifferent to the H'Gusten's rights and periodically sent a combine to harvest the H'Gusten's fruit. </p> <p>Breeon's job was difficult, because the harvester was painted yellow, which his ring had no power against. He was further dismayed when, after awaking from an hour of unconsciousness inflicted by the combine, he was alerted by his ring that he had only two minutes of power left. He was unable to recharge it, his battery was buried beneath the yellow sand. Panicking, he demanded, pleaded, and tried to make deals with his ring for more power. All his requests were met with negative responses. </p> <p>After throwing in rocks and the like, he realized his power ring itself was indestructible, and threw it into the combine. The great machine was unable to break the ring, and, due to its internal complexity, it overloaded until explosion. </p> <p>Thrilled by his success against overwhelming adversity, Breeon thanked his ring, but there was no response from it. It was buried under the yellow sands.</p> <p>Breeon eventuallyÂ retrieved his ring, and underwent training with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6952\" href=\"/kilowog/4005-6952/\" slug=\"kilowog\">Kilowog</a>. Together with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6953\" href=\"/reemuz/4005-6953/\" slug=\"reemuz\">Reemuz</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49675\" href=\"/umitu/4005-49675/\" slug=\"umitu\">Umitu</a> they tried to protect Oa from the mistakenly perceived attack of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21508\" href=\"/mon-el/4005-21508/\" slug=\"mon-el\">Valor</a>. Once again faced with a yellow machine, the Green Lantern had to stand aside as Valor landed the ship. He had not been attacking Oa, rather, Valor was bringing the injured Green Lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49694\" href=\"/alia/4005-49694/\" slug=\"alia\">Alia</a> to Oa for medical treatment.</p> <p>After the destruction of the Green Lantern Corps, Breeon was captured by an interstellar slave ring. He and scores of other powerless Green Lanterns were rescued by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\" href=\"/guy-gardner/4005-1791/\" slug=\"guy-gardner\">Guy Gardner</a>. Since the reformation of the Corps. Breeon has served as a senior officer and gifted problem solver and strategist. It is said that the Guardians have consulted with Breeon on occasion to discuss military strategies.</p>",

She was working on a form of gene therapy, a retrovirus called Lot 777, that would hopefully cure Parkinson's Disease. While studying a sample of Lot 777, Sara accidentally infected herself with the retrovirus and fell into a coma. She was pregnant at the time and spent four months comatose. Luckily Sara got out of her coma and she gave birth to a daughter. Not much later, Sara and her husband Scott were walking with their infant daughter, Madeline, when <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> came crashing out of the side of a building, caught in the arms of a super-villain. With the debris falling down around them, Sara saved her family by holding a piece of the building's wall above their head while Spider-Man continued his pursuit of the criminal. She then noticed she had superpowers and wanted to start a career as a super-hero.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Jackpot (Sara Ehret) was created by Dan Slott and Phil Jimenez and first appeared in the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/free-comic-book-day-2007-spider-man/4050-20300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Free Comic Book Day 2007 </a>comic book. Her persona was further created by Marc Guggenheim and Salvador Larroca. Sara was only Jackpot in her initial appearance, the other appearances of Jackpot was actually Sara's friend <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/alana-jobson/4005-77812/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alana Jobson</a>. When Alana died, Sara again took the identity back.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>One costume, two persons</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/260784-156247-jackpot.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/260784-156247-jackpot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"Sara in her first appearance as Jackpot\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/260784-156247-jackpot.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Sara in her first appearance as Jackpot</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Three years later, Sara Ehret, under the name Jackpot, became a registered hero with the <a href=\"/the-initiative/4060-42781/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42781\">The Initiative</a> where she received training in her fighting skills. However, she soon became tired of the superhero business and sold her costumed identity to someone else. Who remained to be seen. This new version of Jackpot was seen going after a truck that belonged to a criminal in a Demon Mask, filled with explosives. She managed to stop the truck before it could hit a building, witch would have caused the explosives to detonate and would have caused a disaster. She however couldn't apprehend the villain who drove the car. During this time she also met Spider-man for the first time. After the incident, Spider-Man kept asking her what her name was, Jackpot asked him what his was. Spider-Man jokingly replied \"<a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Flash Thompson</a>\", so Jackpot claimed her name was \"Sara Ehret.\" This name turns out to be a fake secret identity when Spider-Man went to the address of the only Sara Ehret he found in the phone book and found a blonde woman with short hair who tells him that she is not the hero Jackpot.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Later, Spider-Man gets really curious and tests a coffee cup with Jackpot's fingerprints on it, it was then revealed that the fingerprints belongs to a woman named <a href=\"../../alana-jobson/29-77812/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alana Jobson</a>. Alana had been a woman with great troubles in her life. She had feelings for a woman but tried to hide it from others. She became a social worker whom wanted to do more then just help in the small amounts she now did. Spider-Man visits her house and finds lots of drugs in her drawer. Jackpot then comes home and starts taking her costumes off, and Spider-Man sees her back with lots of bloodstains. Jackpot realises that Spider-Man was present, and she battles him at first but she then tells Spider-Man what happened. Jackpot told Spider-Man that her Super Hero license was bought from Sara Ehret after Sara decided to quit from the superhero business. To have powers, Jackpot took a number of drugs including Mutant Growth Hormones. Spider-Man tells her to quit and leaves her to think.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Jackpot later appears when Spider-Man was fighting a villain named <a href=\"/blindside/4005-25183/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25183\">Blindside</a> that had the ability to blind people with just a touch. Blindside touches Jackpot causing her to go blind but Spider-Man gave her an anti-dote that stopped her going blind, Jackpot and Spider-Man finally defeat him. After defeating Blindside, something goes wrong with <a href=\"../../alana-jobson/29-77812/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jackpot</a>, and she dies. Spider-Man took the body to <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> to find out what caused the death. Reed Richards tell him that the poison that was released from Blindside that makes people blind killed her, her body couldn't take on too many drugs so she had an overdose and died. After the incident, he brings Jackpot's costume to <a href=\"/sara-ehret/4005-51352/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51352\">Sara</a> telling her to continue Jackpot's work and tells her that \"<a href=\"/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility/4015-40616/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40616\">With great power, comes great responsibility</a>\".</p><h3>Return as Jackpot</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35113/939367-1251505103b.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35113/939367-1251505103b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35113/939367-1251505103b.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35113/939367-1251505103b.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Sara takes Spider-Man's words to heart even though she feels it was more of a guilt trip than a motivational speech. Sara redesigned the Jackpot costume to be more practical and begins her career anew as a superhero. Six months later, Sara gets wind of an illegal drug ring in <a href=\"/brooklyn/4020-57075/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57075\">Brooklyn</a>, New York and comes across her first supervillain, <a href=\"/boomerang/4005-6299/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6299\">Boomerang</a>. Jackpot is able to hold her own fairly well and even shoots Boomerang with her grappling hook. However, feeling outnumbered between Boomerang and three gun-toting thugs, she makes her exit, but not before pocketing a sample of an unknown substance the criminals were transporting.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At Phelcorps Labs, Sara has the mystery substance analyzed by Doctor Hayes and discovers it is a sweat gland. Jackpot hits the streets searching for answers and comes across <a href=\"/white-rabbit/4005-15281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15281\">White Rabbit</a>. Spider-Man, working an investigation of his own involving the <a href=\"/maggia/4060-26082/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26082\">Maggia</a> crime family, shows up and the two heroes work together to question the White Rabbit and learn she is trafficking a new drug called Ebony. The next day, Jackpot takes the sweat gland to Reed Richards to have it analysed. Richards states that her sample is similar to one brought in by <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a> who had taken one from the <a href=\"/owl/4005-13908/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13908\">Owl</a> earlier that week. Due to the sweat gland containing recombinant DNA, Richards compared it to DNA samples he had on the superhumans and found that the sweat gland had come from the <a href=\"/corruptor/4005-13989/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13989\">Corruptor</a>. Reed also posits that the Corruptor didn't willingly agree to give up his sweat glands as the procedure is extremely painful even with anesthesia. As the sample taken from the Owl has been cooked, Sara comes to the conclusion that the Ebony drug is derived from the Corruptor's glands.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After a night of searching for answers on the Corruptor's whereabouts, Sara returns home. As she and her family are having dinner, Boomerang appears at her doorstep having learned her identity via a fingerprint on Jackpot's grappling hook. Boomerang stabs Sara's husband Scott with a boomerang and attacks her, throwing a boomerang at Sara's daughter. Sara was able to block the projectile with a kitchen chair. Using the boomerang, Sara sliced at Boomerang's neck and escaped with Madeline to the Baxter Building.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/1682455-webofspiderman_9_jackpot_alias.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/1682455-webofspiderman_9_jackpot_alias.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/1682455-webofspiderman_9_jackpot_alias.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/1682455-webofspiderman_9_jackpot_alias.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In rage over her husband's death, Sara asks the Fantastic Four to watch her daughter and she hits the streets as Jackpot, searching for Boomerang's employer. After beating the information out of a number of thugs, Jackpot learns of <a href=\"/rose/4005-58537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58537\">The Rose</a>. Spider-Man shows up and tries to keep her from going after him but Jackpot refuses to listen. Together, the two heroes track the criminal down but are confronted by the <a href=\"/armadillo/4005-6800/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6800\">Armadillo</a>. Jackpot is thrown out the window but is able to land on her feet only to have to fight with thugs under the mind-controlling effects of Ebony. Spider-Man helps her out after he subdues The Rose and Armadillo.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the police arrive and the Rose is in custody, Jackpot confronts the criminal and discovers that he is Doctor Hayes. After Sara's accident with Lot 777, the funding to Hayes's genetic research was pulled and the doctor decided to turn to more 'aggressive' methods to finance his research. Afterwards, with her secret identity known by criminals and her husband dead, Sara takes Madeline and moves to Sherman Oaks, California to live under assumed identities. Madeline now goes by the name Sydney and Sara has taken on the name Alana Jobson, in honor of her dead friend.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><ul><li>Superhuman strength, durability, and endurance</li><li>Carries grappling hook launcher</li><li>Skilled biologist</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>Peter Abel Nightroad is the main character in 'Trinity Blood'. He had made a promise not to kill anyone to pay off his past sins even if it ment for him to die. Abel is a priest and a Crusnik Vampire, meaning he drinks Vampire blood and only Vampire blood. He protects humans. However, he is also part of \"Ax\", a special operations group controlled by the Cardinal Catherina. His encounter with a young girl called Esther will determine the struggle and survival between the human race and the vampires.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Abel is an AX agent for the with extraordinary powers granted by the Crusnik nanomachines. The nano-technology was found on Mars while humanity attempted to colonize Earth. During the process, the Bacillus was also found. The Bacillus transformed the colonists into vampires known as Methuselah while the Crusnik turned four select test tube babies into something higher in the food chain. Abel was one of them but the exact means of circumstances are still unknown. Anyhow, with these new abilities, he was forced to pick a side during a massive war between the Methuselah and the humans called \"Terrans\" by the vampires. Abel, along with his brother Cain and his sister Seth, joined the Methuselah. During this time, Abel slaughters seven million humans while his sister Lilith fought the front allying with the humans who were supported by the . While he continued to fight, his insane brother Cain killed Lilith forcing Abel in a state of sorrow but not before throwing his own brother out of the space ship, to what he thought was his doom. Weeping at Lilith's grave for 900 years, Abel eventually pledged his allegiance to the and the Ministry of Holy Affairs.</p><p>In the year 3055 A.D, he joined the AX, short for Arcanum Cella Ex Dono Dei(Latin for Papal State Affairs Special Operations Section). They are elite nuns and priests with powers granted by lost technologies. They serve under Cardinal Caterina Sforza and their missions require them to investigate vampires. Though obviously powerful, Abel is a pacifist and masks himself in clumsy nature only summoning his Crusnik powers when absolutely necessary.</p><p>In his travels, he meets a nun by the name of Esther Blanchett and is hesitant to use his Crusnik form for the fear of her seeing him in it. Once he does however, depending on the adaptation, he becomes engulfed in sorrow and distraught yet she still joins AX nevertheless. He becomes like a fatherly figure to her but Esther has much more romantic feelings for Abel. It is unknown whether or not he shares the same feelings for Esther but when he thought she had been murdered, he loses control and appeared to enjoy killing the Methuselah Radu. In the aftermath of this, Esther aids in Abel's return to his human form. Not much later, he learns of Cain's return and pledges to kill his brother once and for all. In their first meeting, Cain beats Abel because of his superior Crusnik fusion and also because he was distracted by Esther. He entered a near death state with his brother attempting to merge with him in order to recover the codes for the missile control panel Abel had destroyed. Father Tres interferes, even though he his no match for the Crusnik Abel is revived using Lilith's nanomachines granting him a 100% Crusnik form in which he fights his brother to a draw. Afterward, Abel along with Father Fortuna, go off in search of Cain to battle until one of them finally dies.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>Abel is a great marksman fighting with pistols load with silver bullets. In order to activate his Crusnik form, he issues a verbal or mental command but it isn't necessary. The verbal command, depending on the method and wording, will unlock certain stages of his Crusnik powers but depending on the adaptation the commands differ slightly. When at 40% activation, his teeth become fangs, lips become a dark blue color and his eyes turn red. In this state, he can summon a scythe from crystallizing his blood. At 80%, Abel will grow black wings, nails will elongate while generating collosal amounts of electricity from his body to use as blasts or shields. Only in the anime is he able to achieve 100% but he becomes something similar to a demon with dark skin, bat like wings and blue markings covering his body. In this state, he can generate even more electricity then in his 80% form and a second blade on the opposite end of the scythe will appear.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>One of the <a href=\"/seven-unknown-men-of-slaughter-swamp/4060-57067/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57067\">Seven Unknown Men</a>, the being who would become Zor was tasked with protecting and maintaining the continuity and vibrancy of the <a href=\"/dc-multiverse/4015-43603/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43603\">multiverse</a>. Separating from his fellows, he became determined to shape the world as he saw fit, destroying that which he saw as childish. To this end he wove the menace of the <a href=\"/sheeda/4060-57043/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57043\">Sheeda</a> into continuity, and set them to invade the present day, though it had not yet reached the utopian state the Sheeda typically prey upon.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Zor was created by <a href=\"/jerry-siegel/4040-40754/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40754\">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href=\"/bernard-baily/4040-6098/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6098\">Bernard Baily</a>. He made his first appearance in <a href=\"/more-fun-comics-55-zor/4000-116387/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-116387\"><em>More Fun Comics</em> #55</a>. The character was significantly rebooted by <a href=\"/grant-morrison/4040-40434/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40434\">Grant Morrison</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Golden Age</h3><p>In the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\">Golden Age</a>, Zor was a magician of unknown provenance who possessed vast mystical powers. He described himself as a spirit who had wandered the <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a> for centuries, causing evil.</p><h3>Modern Age</h3><p>The <a href=\"/modern-age-of-comics/4015-56028/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56028\">Modern Age</a> introduced the current version of Zor, recreating him completely as a metatextual entity. It is unclear if he simply assumed the identity of Zor in the present time, and is therefore a facsimile or body thief, or if he lived through Zor's publication history, and is thus the original, actual Zor; dialogue implies the latter is the case. This would suggest that his Golden Age exploits remain canon, though his motivations for his actions then are unclear.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Spectre</h3><p>Zor reveals himself to the <a href=\"/spectre/4005-2361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2361\">Spectre</a>, and the pair battle briefly, with Zor gaining the upper hand before abruptly vanishing. Disguising himself as <a href=\"/jim-corrigan/4005-5810/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5810\">Jim Corrigan</a> he abducts <a href=\"/clarice-winston/4005-15848/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15848\">Clarice Winston</a> and takes her into an alternate dimension, where he attempts to entrap her. The Spectre tracks him down and tricks Zor into snaring himself in a paralysis beam. He manages to contact a scientist telepathically, and convinces him to free him from the beam. Seeking revenge on the Spectre, he frames Corrigan for murder. Easily besting the Spectre in combat, he rescues a condemned murderer from being executed and sends him to kidnap Clarice. He traps the Spectre, intending him to witness Clarice's death. Spectre manages to escape and construct a casket out of ectobane, a substance to which evil spirits such as Zor have a weakness. Zor is entrapped in the casket and thrown over a waterfall.</p><h3>Seven Soldiers of Victory</h3><p>Plotting with the Sheeda in <a href=\"/slaughter-swamp/4020-56530/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56530\">Slaughter Swamp</a>, Zor is encountered by the <a href=\"/newsboy-army/4060-57077/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57077\">Newsboy Army</a>. He sews each of them a suit of clothing that corrupts their character arcs, causing the team to darken and ultimately fall apart in scandal. His actions are unknown in the intervening decades. In the present day, he encounters <a href=\"/zatanna/4005-5691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\">Zatanna</a> as she enters Slaughter Swamp seeking the Unknown Men. The pair conduct a magical battle within their minds. Zor successfully breaks Zatanna's <a href=\"/gwydion/4005-66470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66470\">Merlin</a>, and attempts to absorb the comic book universe into himself. He is subdued by Zatanna, and taken into the custody of the Seven Unknown Men. One of the Seven stitches him into a miser's coat, enmeshing him into the story of <a href=\"/solomon-grundy/4005-8342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8342\">Cyrus Gold</a>. He sends Zor-as-Gold out into Slaughter Swamp just in time for him to be found and murdered by the townsfolk, thus creating Solomon Grundy.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As an Unknown Man, Zor technically exists outside the narrative, and so is theoretically omnipotent while in the story. He is a reality warper, able to cause anything he wishes to occur; this often manifests itself as something resembling magic. Though he possesses cosmic awareness and is aware of the <a href=\"/fourth-wall/4015-44795/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44795\">fourth wall</a>, he does not appear to be omnipotent, and does not seem to fully grasp that he himself is fictional.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>Zor possesses a <a href=\"/time-sewing-machine/4055-56288/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56288\">time-sewing machine</a> with which he can sew suits for characters to wear, thus dictating the courses of their character arcs. It can also be used to sew up holes in time.</p>",

    "deck": "Elle Bishop is the adoptive daughter of Robert \"Bob\" Bishop, the head of the Company. She has the ability to create and control electricity but recently, she has lost control of her ability.",
    "description": "<p>Elle sits in her father's office as he hands her her first Company assignmentâ monitoring <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47664\" href=\"/claire-bennet/4005-47664/\" slug=\"claire-bennet\">              Claire Bennet</a>. Elle brushes the assignment off as pointless, but Bob reminds her Claire and her blood could become a great asset to the Company, like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48433\" href=\"/mr-linderman/4005-48433/\" slug=\"mr-linderman\">             Linderman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58326\" href=\"/arthur-petrelli/4005-58326/\" slug=\"arthur-petrelli\">            Arthur Petrelli</a>. </p> <p>On Day 17 of her assignment, Elle sits behind Claire in social studies class in school. She talks about her hatred for Claire and draws a picture of her electrocuting Claire. During a stake-out at the Bennets' house, Elle watches <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47669\" href=\"/hrg/4005-47669/\" slug=\"hrg\">           Noah</a> and Sandra through a window. Elle hears a growl next to her and turns to see <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54965\" href=\"/mr-muggles/4005-54965/\" slug=\"mr-muggles\">          Mr. Muggles</a>, who starts barking at her. Elle tries to shoo him away, but he continues barking. She decides to shock him and begins charging up, but unfortunately for her, the sprinklers turn on and she electrocutes herself. </p> <p>Out of the shadows, Eden tells Elle she read her file and found out water shorts out and reverse her ability. Eden proceeds to beat Elle down, saying if Elle doesn't use her ability, then she won't use hers. Noah comes outside to stop Eden and tells Elle to stop spying on themâ watching over Claire is his job. Elle gets up and walks away, saying once Claire manifests her ability and gets handed over to the Company, she will be as nice to Claire as Eden was to Elle. At school the next day, Elle watches as Claire and Zach talk in the hallway. </p> <p>Elle watches Claire and Zach talk outside school, but backs off after receiving a disapproving look from Noah. Later, Elle spies on Zach and Claire from afar, just missing Claire's sixth test of her ability at the abandoned refinery. She notices the two watching a tape and devises a plan to get it. </p> <p>Elle walks up to Zach's home and knocks on the front door. Zach answers and she tells him her name's Cindyâ she's in his fourth period English class and he was going to let her copy his notes. Elle ignores Zach's statement that he doesn't remember any of that, and after realizing flirting with him is futile, creates a ball of electricity to threaten him. Before she can use it, however, Noah and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47667\" href=\"/haitian/4005-47667/\" slug=\"haitian\">         Haitian</a> step in and Noah pistol whips Elle, knocking her out. The Haitian proceeds to erase Elle's memory of Zach and the tape. </p> <p>On Day 27 of her assignment, Elle sits in social studies class and ponders what other, more important things she can be doing. Elle reminds herself her dad said if Claire doesn't manifest an ability by next week, the assignment is canceled. Elle is grateful for that, because Homecoming is next week and Elle would have to shoot herself if she had to attend. </p> <p>After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59158\" href=\"/matt-neuenberg/4005-59158/\" slug=\"matt-neuenberg\">        Matt Neuenberg</a> is booed off-stage at his school talent show, Elle tells Matt she can take him to a place where he'll be safe from the outside world. To diminish his distrust, Elle electrocutes the stage and sets it on fire and leads him out. At the Company's facility, Elle watches aside her father as Matt is tested on by a man and the Haitian. Matt screams Elle's name in pain, causing Elle to show pain as well. She brings a cake to Matt in his cell and lights the candles. Matt asks her why she didn't protected him like she promised, but she says by bringing him here, she already has. She tells him they're not that different and they both want the same thing, then gives him an electric kiss on the cheek. </p> <p>Elle stands behind Matt Neuenberg in the Company computer room. She checks on his progress and gives him a playful zap to his nose to lighten the mood. She leaves for a moment to get donuts for the two of them, and on her return, is asked by Matt who would send files from Bhutan. Elle wonders who would do anything in Bhutan, then calls her father per request of Matt to find out if he knows anything. After she calls him, she drops the phone in a panic and pushes Matt out of the way. She pulls out a pair of goggles from a device and hastily puts them on Matt, telling him she needs to delete all the information in the mainframe and also needs Matt to store all the information in his mind before she can do so. After promising Matt it'll be painless, Elle hits a button on the device to begin the information storage into Matt's brain.</p> <p>Matt manages to memorize all the information, and Elle uses her powers to destroy the machine, possibly killing Hana and Drucker. Bob praises Neuenberg for his work, but ignores Elle. Later, Elle tries to take Matt out, just him, her and a bodyguard, but they actually try to take the information from his mind. The process kills Matt, and Elle is left looking distraught over his dead body.<br/><br/>Later, she works with Thompson Jr. to recruit a girl named Donna who has the ability to see long range distances. Donna was then tipped off by a anonymous person named \"evsdropr\" that he was being followed. Donna then shoots Thompson Jr. then Elle told Donna that he would be fine and Elle recruits Donna into the Company.<br/><br/>Elle was then later sent to capture <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47679\" href=\"/sylar/4005-47679/\" slug=\"sylar\">       Sylar</a> by her father. Sylar escaped from her and Bob was not happy about it. He was disappointed and wouldn't forgive Elle. After a while, Elle then realized that the Company has a whole \"buffet of powers in level 5\" and thinks that he will come to the Company to take this powers but Sylar was closer than she thinks, she sees her father's head opened up without the brain and quickly realizes that Sylar was in the building. She quickly storms to level 5 and asks for the help of Noah Bennet. Noah Bennet helps her but Sylar was too fast. He throws Elle with his telekinesis and she was hurt quite bad. She then tries to use her ability but Sylar pinned her to the ground with his telekinesis and he starts to cut the top of Elle's head open. Elle starts screaming and she causes a electrical out burst releasing the villains. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57706\" href=\"/angela-petrelli/4005-57706/\" slug=\"angela-petrelli\">      Angela</a> then tells Elle that she has no use in the Company anymore and Angela tells her to get a new life.<br/><br/>Elle is now in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">     London</a> and she has somehow lost control of her ability. Daphne tires to recruit Elle forÂ the Pinehearst company in the London subwaysÂ but Elle declinedÂ and thought that theÂ thing she doesn't need in her life is another company. Elle then tries to find HRG for help about her ability and she first finds <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47665\" href=\"/claude/4005-47665/\" slug=\"claude\">    Claude Rains</a>. She asks Claude Rains where HRG was but he wouldn't help her. Claude then runs away but Elle loses control over her ability in the rain and her ability shocks herself and Claude. Later, two people named Lee and Abigail helps Claude up and Claude tells them to help and take Elle in too. After that, Elle wakes up and talks to Claude about his father and Claude persuades Elle to forgive Bob. Later, Elle goes to the bathhouse and relaxes in the hot tub but she loses control over her ability and shocks Abigail, she gets angry and she kicks Elle, just at that moment, Lee comes in and tells Elle that she should leave... with no places to go, Elle goes to the Bennet's house to find HRGÂ and then she shocks Lyle.<br/>Â <br/>When Claire comes back home with her mum, the lights in the house all malfunctioned. Claire tries to find what the problem is and she finds a unconscious Lyle lying on the ground, Lyle tells her that Elle is back. Claire finds Elle and she attempts to throw her out of the house but Elle refuses. Lyle then pours a bucket of water all over her making her electrocute herself. <br/></p><p>She is then told by Claire that a company named Pinehearst could help her regain control over her ability. Claire agrees that she would a company Elle to Pinehearst. Whilst on the plane to Pinehearst Elle starts to shoot electricity that started to interrupt with the air plane mechanics. It is then revealed that Elle is frightened of flying. To solve the situation and save the people that are on the plane, Claire tells Elle to put the electricity through her because of her healing ability she is able to to survive the currents going through her, and saves the plane from going down and stop's Elle's panic attack at the same time.Â </p><p>As they reach Pinehearst, they witness  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47678\" href=\"/peter-petrelli/4005-47678/\" slug=\"peter-petrelli\">   Peter Petrelli</a> thrown from the seventh story window. Claire takes her uncle away from the building, and asks Elle for help. After learning that Pinehearst can take away other's powers. Elle cant let that opportunity go, so she run's towards the entrance of Pinehearst, but turns and thanks Claire for everything she had done for her. This is the first time it is seen of Elle thanking anyone.Â Â </p><p>The next time Elle is seen is in a Flash back. The flash back is dated a year from the present, showing that Elle was partnered with Noah Bennet (Claires Adopted Father) working for The Company. The two were assigned to watch Gabriel Gray (Sylar) and figure out how he transfers the abilities he takes. Gabriel was about to take his life, but Elle manages to stop him from doing that and as instructed befriends him. Gabriel developed an attraction towards Elle, and this somehow suppresses his hunger for more power. Noah using a list of people with abilities Gabriel had compiled arranges to introduce Gabriel to one of them to see his power in action. Elle did not want the plan to come to  fruition, which revealed that Elle had developed feelings for Gabriel Gray. Unfortunately Elle goes along with the plan and introduces Gabriel to a man named Trevor who has the ability of kinetic projection.Â  In the presence of Gabriel, Elle kept making references to how special Trevor was. As a result of Elle's comments about how special Trevor was, angered Gabriel and he ordered her to leave as he killed Trevor.Â  Elle felt the guilt of causing the moment 'Sylar' was born. <br/>That was the end of the flashback. <br/></p><p>Back now in the present Elle is shown in Pinehearst changed to a metal wall, still in pain with her ability out of control. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58326\" href=\"/arthur-petrelli/4005-58326/\" slug=\"arthur-petrelli\">  Arthur Petrelli</a> made a meeting between Sylar and Elle, he wanted Sylar to gain her ability but without the killing, using empathy to 'copy' the ability. As Sylar walks into where Elle was kept she immediately attacks him over and over again, enraged at Sylar for killing her father. Eventually her falling to the floor begging him to kill her since she wanted her pain to go away. Sylar acting out of character tells her that he forgives her for making him the monster he became. And tells her that she should forgive herself for all her crimes she committed, wanting to take away the pain she feels without killing her. At that moment Elle regains perfect control of her ability.Â  And for the first time Sylar gained her ability also without having to kill for it. It seemed that as Elle was teaching Sylar to use and control her ability, the pairs attraction towards each other appeared. <br/></p><p>Elle and Sylar were sent to retrieve Claire since it seemed she was the missing part of the formula to allow normal people to gain powers. On the mission Elle set up some sort of game and challenge to Sylar. For him to prove he was still a murderer and 'not a mummy's boy'. He killed a rental car assistant. In the end they found Claire with her adopted dad Noah, a fight ensues. However Elle and Sylar find themselves powerless due to the Eclipse.Â  Elle aims to kill Noah by pointing a gun at him, Claire jumped in front of him and took the bullet. Noah in a fury knock's Elle out and dislocates Sylars arm.Â  After awakening Sylar states to Elle that he quite like's not having his power's. There was no hunger for him to control now. Elle shocked just stated that they cant just take whatever they want now.Â  Sylar retorts the statement and smiles as he grabs Elle for a very passionate kiss. <br/></p><p>Outside Noah is aiming a rifle at the couple. Noah confronts them and Elle is shot in the thigh, Sylar takes Elle and flees to a super market. Elle's blood trail allows for Noah to find them in the store, where Sylar and Elle had already made a plan to ambush him. As he arrives Sylar shoves Elle into a Cargo elevator to protect her from Noah. From the cargo elevator Elle see's Noah cut Sylars throat with a box cutter.Â  <br/></p><p>The eclipse ends and both Sylar and Elle are repowered. Sylar is revived from the gift he took from Claire. Elle and Sylar start heading for the Bennet residence.Â  They quickly overcome Noah and Claire and grab Claire's adoptive mother Sandra, they use Sandra as there hostage. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47668\" href=\"/hiro-nakamura/4005-47668/\" slug=\"hiro-nakamura\"> Hiro</a> managed to save the Bennet family by teleporting Elle and Sylar to and ocean front scene. In which Elle sighs, but Sylar pulls her in for there last kiss. He follows this up with an explanation that he and Elle are \"Damaged Goods\" and that neither of them would \"Never Change\". Elle looks confused at Sylar but starts to feel a huge pain across her head. Sylar had started to kill Elle.</p><p>The last scene is of Sylar pouring fluid over Elle's lifeless body. He sets her body a blaze with the power she gave him, painfully saying \"<b>Good-Bye Elle</b>\"</p>",

Round 2 </figcaption></figure>Â  <br/>Â Hiro's brain tumor got worse and he ended up in hospital where he entered a brain tumor caused hallucination. <br/>They were in the Burnt Toast Dinner where Adam said that the case is 'The World vs. Hiro' and the judge himself is Hiro's father, Kaito Nakamura.Adam is the prosecutor and acusses Hiro of breaking his own code as a hero.Adam than called the first witnesses who were a young Kimiko Nakamura and Ando Masahashi. <br/>Adam questioned Hiro about the 'carnival slushy' incident where present-day Ando who was Hiro's lawyer objected that his client only helped two people fell in love.The witnesses than arrived among them Sylar as well, but Charlie Anders wasn't there.Adam than questioned again and for the last time Hiro about her whereabouts.Hiro told that he made a deal with a villain who double crossed him and now Charlie is 'gone' in time. Kaito Nakamura found Hiro guilty. <br/>After being found guilty HIro entered a hallway wich led a way into a light and everybody from the dinner was there Ando,Kaito, Lynette.When Hiro stopped he told his father that if this is the end than he wants to go out with pride.Kaito agreed and Hiro found himself face-to-face with Adam Monroe who was armed with a katana.Hiro had Takezo Kensei's sword.The two had a sword duel while Adam tried to force Hiro into the light,but overall Hiro overpowered Adam and stabbed him eventually killing him and ending the halluciantion.<br/><br/><p><b><h2>Â Powers</h2></b> <br/>Â  </p> <p> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33869/1025082-adam_monroe_heroes_450151_796_1330.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1025082\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6708542713568\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33869/1025082-adam_monroe_heroes_450151_796_1330.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1025082\"><img alt=\"Â exactly at the time of his death, Adam had 377 years old(Not 400!)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33869/1025082-adam_monroe_heroes_450151_796_1330.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33869/1025082-adam_monroe_heroes_450151_796_1330.jpg 796w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33869/1025082-adam_monroe_heroes_450151_796_1330.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Â exactly at the time of his death, Adam had 377 years old(Not 400!)\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33869/1025082-adam_monroe_heroes_450151_796_1330.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33869/1025082-adam_monroe_heroes_450151_796_1330.jpg 796w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33869/1025082-adam_monroe_heroes_450151_796_1330.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Â exactly at the time of his death, Adam had 377 years old(Not 400!)</figcaption></figure> <p>Adam has the same power as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47664\" href=\"/claire-bennet/4005-47664/\" slug=\"claire-bennet\">      Claire</a>, cellular rapid regeneration/spontaneous regeneration. But we have seen the full extent of his power unlike Claire's, as his powers have allowed him to live for 400 years. It has also let him live through being shot by arrows and slitting his own wrists. The only way Adam can get killed is by a bullet right through the head of just some solid object in the head. However, if the object gets removed from his brain, he would regenerate again. The reason he will \"die\" when something is in his head is that as soon as something enters his brain, the brain would instantly stop working and will not regenerate anymore. If the object is removed from the brain, the brain would work again and regenerate instantly. Adam is quite knowledgeable of and skilled in the use of a sword, rivaling Hiro Nakamura himself.Â Â  </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Vanya was one of several 'special' children born randomly from mothers who had shown no signs of pregnancy. He (along with six others) was raised by Reginal Hargreeves to save the world. Vanya always felt out of place among the group because she never demonstrated any of the special skills they had.Â </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Vanya was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-44898\" href=\"/gerard-way/4040-44898/\" slug=\"gerard-way\">Gerard Way</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-44899\" href=\"/gabriel-ba/4040-44899/\" slug=\"gabriel-ba\">Gabriel BÃ¡</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Apocalypse Suite</h3><p>Vanya Hargreeves is one of the children adopted by Sir <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47213\" href=\"/monocle/4005-47213/\" slug=\"monocle\">Reginald Hargreeves</a>. Unlike the rest of the children, she was not allowed to go into the field or do much of anything. She was always told that there was \"nothing special\" about her. As a result, she grew up self conscious and with little confidence. Her only real skill, however, was music; she could play the Violin extremely well. The rest of her 'family' had no interest in her music, and would not attend her recitals.</p><p>As she grew older, she wrote a book, a sort of tell all entitled: 'Extra-Ordinary: My Life as Number Seven'.</p><p>An excerpt from her book concerning her childhood reads, \"I was never made to feel a part of the team, much less the family, and I was just happy to be sent off to school.\"</p><p>The only person she had a close bond with was Diego Hargreeves, AKA The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47215\" href=\"/kraken/4005-47215/\" slug=\"kraken\">Kraken</a>. But since she left them, he felt that she abandoned him, and wants nothing to do with her anymore.</p><p>Shunned even after Reginald Hargreeves' death, Vanya was invited to perform in the Orchestra Verdammten by the Conductor. He needed someone to be the lead violin in his Apocalypse Sonata. She refused, giving her family one more chance. They argued and fought, sending her away again. Then the Conductor of 'The Orchestra Verdammten,' changed her forever. He revealed that Sir. Hargreeves ran extensive experiments on his children as they slept, and that according to Hargreeves' notes, she was \"the most dangerous of all.\" He had put together an experiment to change Vanya, though the Conductor had modified the experimentation to be more painful.</p><p>After some tweaking and operations, he changed her physical appearance and seemingly amplified whatever power she had. Her mind was also warped, so she now reveled in destruction and chaos. With the first note from her violin, she ripped the Conductor in half. The next target was the headquarters of the Umbrella Academy. With mere notes she destroyed the memorial statue of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48736\" href=\"/horror/4005-48736/\" slug=\"horror\">Horror</a>, and killed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47847\" href=\"/pogo/4005-47847/\" slug=\"pogo\">Pogo</a>. She then invited them to her recital.</p><p>Back at the Icarus theater (where the Orchestra was based) the White Violin prepared to end the world. The murderers of the Orchestra kept most of the Umbrella Academy at bay. The White Violin cut the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47846\" href=\"/the-rumor/4005-47846/\" slug=\"the-rumor\">Rumor</a>'s throat before she could suggest anything. Before the White Violin could kill anyone else, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47848\" href=\"/the-seance/4005-47848/\" slug=\"the-seance\">SÃ©ance</a> distracted her by pretending to channel Hargreeves, telling her how much of a disappointment she had ended up being. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-60400\" href=\"/0005/4005-60400/\" slug=\"0005\">00.05</a> then shot her in the head. Before she passed out, White Violin said that the symphony could not be stopped. A huge chunk of the moon fell to Earth, going to end it all. The SÃ©ance, in a display of power he didn't know he had, caught it with his telekinesis and saved the world.</p><p>They managed to save both Rumor and the White Violin. Rumor's vocal cords had been destroyed, the White Violin was left paralyzed and amnesiac. She did not know what she had done. The Rumor forced her to watch the news, see the destruction she had created. Although it was shown that Rumor had developed a grudge against her sister, it is later shown that she has forgiven her. Visting her in the hospital and comforting her.</p><h3>Dallas</h3><p>White Violin remains paralyzed and powerless. She remembers none of what happened to her.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>At first, the White Violin seemed powerless. After some experimentation, her true powers were unlocked.Â The music she plays is dangerous, highly destructive. With a note she can rip a man in half, and a symphony can destroy the world. Vanya despite seeming to lack powers for most of her life, was actually revealed to be the most powerful of the children.Â </p>",
