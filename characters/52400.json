    "description": "<p>Colonel Hammersmith was once stationed at Fort Charlotte in Lynchburg, Virginia where he eventually met Jonah Hex. Jonah intended to surrender only himself because he felt guilty for what he had done to General Stonewall Jackson. Jonah had accidently shot the man he respected because Jonah mistook the general as a Union soldier who was trying to surprise him.  <br/> <br/>Hammersmith accepted Jonah's surrender but first he wanted to make Jonah suffer. Hammersmith noticed the mud on Jonah's boots and on the hooves of Jonah's horse. Hammersmith figured that the rest of Jonah's platoon was hiding in the swamps nearby a plateau. Jonah's platoon was captured and brought to the fort so they could confront their supposed turncoat. Everyone in Jonah's platoon deemed him a traitor after Hammersmith thanked Jonah for his cooperation. The only person who believed in Jonah's sincerity was Jebediah Turnbull.  <br/> <br/>Jonah reacts quickly by grabbing a Union soldier's pistol and begins to shoot at the fort's munitions supply. Explosions were coming from all corners of the fort. Jonah tells Jeb to lead the men out of the fort but Jeb is cut down by Hammersmith's mini gun. Jonah wounds Hammersmith by shooting him in the shoulder. Jonah grabs Jeb's body and escapes with a handful of his platoon. After their grand escape, Jonah's platoon begin to shoot at Jonah. Jonah drops Jeb's body and escapes by heading into the swamps. <br/> <br/>Jonah's platoon returned Jeb's lifeless body to his father, Quentin Turnbull. They told Turnbull about Jonah's treachery and Turnbull swore that Jonah would suffer for the death of his son. As for Hammersmith, he was sent to Gotham City where he met Doctor DuPree and joined the Religion of Crime.             </p>",

    "description": "<p> </p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Seeking an heir, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\">Kang the Conqueror</a> fathered several sons, each called Marcus, throughout time with different women (mostly divergent iterations of his love <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ravonna/4005-27265/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27265\">Princess Ravonna</a>). Kang killed the majority of his sons when each proved an unworthy successor, although <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/marcus-kang/4005-11336/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11336\">Marcus Kang XXIII</a> showed promise, he too was ultimately murdered by Kang. Kang continued to attempt to find an heir, a quest that presumably continued into his transformation into <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/immortus/4005-7215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7215\">Immortus</a>. Immortus and Revelation conceived Marcus Immortus, and the child was born in the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/limbo-dimension/4020-58496/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58496\">Limbo Dimension</a> where he was forced to grow up by himself unable to ever leave for fear of disrupting the timestream.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Marcus Immortus was created by <a href=\"/david-michelinie/4040-40650/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40650\">David Michelinie</a> and <a href=\"/george-perez/4040-2913/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2913\">George Perez</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-avengers/4050-2128/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2128\"><em>The Avengers</em></a> #200.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Marcus Immortus' only major role in a comic book was in his first appearance in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-avengers-200-the-child-is-father-to/4000-20723/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-20723\"><em>The Avengers</em> #200</a>. The issue depicted a largely nonsensical plot which saw <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Ms. Marvel</a> suddenly pregnant with Marcus Immortus' child who, when born, turned out to be Marcus Immortus himself who instantly grew to adulthood and left to rule Limbo with Ms. Marvel. The story was almost universally derided by readers due to it's incomprehensible plot and it's treatment of Ms. Marvel who was victim to an off-panel rape, a subject entirely side-stepped by the issue. Marcus Immortus apparently won the undying affections of Ms. Marvel and the two left to be together forever.</p><p>Due in part to the controversial story, Marvel tried to distance themselves from it and Ms. Marvel was de-powered and didn't appear in books for years to avoid the issue. Marcus Immortus was revealed to have died off-panel and his treatment of Ms. Marvel was confirmed as forced upon her and against her will in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-avengers-annual-10-by-friends-betrayed/4000-20918/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-20918\"><em>Avengers Annual</em> #10</a>. To this day, the exact nature of Ms. Marvel giving birth to the man who impregnated her has not being brought up or explained and writers and fans alike prefer to ignore the story rather than try to make sense of it or justify the treatment of Ms. Marvel's character in it.</p><p>With that said, Marcus Immortus briefly returned in <a href=\"/avengers-the-terminatrix-objective/4050-4986/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4986\"><em>Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective</em></a>, where his true mother was revealed as being Revelation (like Immortus to Kang; the final iteration of Princess Ravonna). Although he appeared in all 4 parts of the storyline, he did not feature heavily and nor was his history with Ms. Marvel brought up.</p><p>Ms. Marvel later met an earlier son of Immortus, Marcus Kang XXIII, during <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kang-dynasty/4045-55765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55765\">Kang Dynasty</a> where she was forced to face her past with Marcus Immortus. Marcus Kang similarly fell deeply in love with her, but despite flashbacks depicting her and Marcus Immortus, no new information or understanding of the original story was presented.</p>",

He wore his  rags to look poor and be unassuming to the criminal element. This  allowed him to get a jump on thugs who believed there was nothing to  fear. He also wore a bullet proof vest underneath his costume. He also  had a sidekick like many Golden Aged heroes named Tiny. A couple of  his villains were The Ghost and Stinger.<br/><h2>Creation<br/></h2> The Golden age <a href=\"../../holyoke/57-1885/\" rel=\"nofollow\">           Holyoke</a> Ragman has nothing to do with the character in <a href=\"../../dc-comics/57-10/\" rel=\"nofollow\">           DC Comics</a>.

    "description": "<h2>Current Events</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-79928\" href=\"/alec-holland/4005-79928/\" slug=\"alec-holland\">Alec Holland</a> was enraged by the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-56079\" href=\"/the-green/4015-56079/\" slug=\"the-green\">Green’s</a> repetitive attempts to entitle him as Swamp Thing. In his rage he tried to rid himself of the bio-restorative formula that would catalyze his transformation into Swamp Thing. Before he can destroy it, Calbraith A.H. Rodgers stops him. Rodgers explains to Holland that he was a pilot of the air force and was shot down to crash. He also explains that before he died the Green saved him and made him a warrior of the Green. He has a message to deliver and convinces Holland to hear him out.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/84167/2561692-2035103_untitled.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2561692\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.91352345906164\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/84167/2561692-2035103_untitled.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2561692\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/84167/2561692-2035103_untitled.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/84167/2561692-2035103_untitled.jpg 1087w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/84167/2561692-2035103_untitled.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/84167/2561692-2035103_untitled.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Rodgers touches Holland and shows him images of the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-56078\" href=\"/the-rot/4015-56078/\" slug=\"the-rot\">Rot</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80394\" href=\"/sethe/4005-80394/\" slug=\"sethe\">Sethe</a>.

    "deck": "An old friend of Barry Allen who was part of a CIA experiment to gain regenerative powers and found that amputated limbs regenerate into full grown duplicates that call themselves Mob Rule.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Before Barry Allen became The Flash, Manuel Lago was a close friend to the would be super hero. Manuel had a habit of getting in trouble, bringing Barry along for the ride, which would usually end with the two running from whoever they angered. Manuel joined the CIA after his father was killed in an air-liner highjacking and asked Barry to join with him, though Barry refused. The CIA trained him to be an elite agent and he took part in an experimental project to give him regenerative powers after he lost his hand. With these powers he became one of the best but he was only biding his time, using the CIA to gain connections and intelligence on the organization that killed his father and he went rogue.</p><p>The organization was called '<a href=\"/basilisk/4060-58836/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58836\">Basilisk</a>' and he began eliminating them one by one until they managed to gain the upper-hand and captured him. Believing that he couldn't have been working alone Basilisk tortured him cutting off his fingers one by one and they discovered they would grow back so they continued cutting him. When Manuel was ready to give up on life these discarded limbs each grew into a whole new copy of Manuel. They felt connected to their 'father' and saved him and working together they continued to fight Basilisk until the duplicates began to die in the order they were 'born'. Instead of staying with them to help discover why they were dying Manuel just ran away like he did to all his problems in his life.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Manuel Lago was created by <a href=\"/the-flash/4050-43018/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-43018\">The Flash</a> writer/artists <a href=\"/francis-manapul/4040-7685/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7685\">Francis Manapul</a> and <a href=\"/brian-buccellato/4040-19223/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-19223\">Brian Buccellato</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Flash</h3><p>While on a date with <a href=\"/patty-spivot/4005-59320/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59320\">Patty Spivot</a> at a science exhibit, Barry Allen manages to stop a group of what look to be terrorists from stealing a human genome re-coder. One of the terrorists dies on the scene after the Flash saved him from falling from a helicopter, immediately some believed it was the Flash's fault. When Barry investigates with the <a href=\"/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57456\">Central City Police</a>, he recognizes the body as his old friend Manuel Lago. The next day, the police find that the suspect mysteriously died from an undetermined reason, not the fall so it was not the Flash's fault. That night while investigating the altered DNA from the body at his own apartment Barry is confronted by Manuel alive and well. Before the shock of his dead friend being alive can wear off the group of terrorists from the science exhibit break in and Manuel leads Barry out the window on a chase through <a href=\"/central-city/4020-54995/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54995\">Central City</a>. Barry takes a dive into the river in order for him to become the Flash. However when Barry catches up to Manuel, he sees that Manuel has been captured by the terrorists who all happen to be duplicates of his friend and are known as Mob Rule.</p><p>The Flash manages to take out several of the duplicates but they have the upper hand and tell him that they have Barry Allen's reporter friend Iris West and they'll only release her if he lets them escape with Manuel. Mob Rule took Manuel to Dr Guerrero who originally gave him his regenerative powers but even with the original genetic source he couldn't why they were dying though the doctor did black out both <a href=\"/keystone-city/4020-40924/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40924\">Keystone</a> and Central Cities trying to find out. After being disappointed with <a href=\"/doctor-guerrero/4005-80589/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80589\">Dr. Guerrero</a>'s performance Mob Rule killed him and sought out the inventor of the genome re-coder they attempted to steam Dr. Darwin Elias to solve their problem. Barry and Patty found Miguel in Dr. Guerrero's lab being held by Mob Rule and tried to rescue him but Barry stayed behind to give them time to escape and was apparently shot. Manuel however is quickly recaptured by Mob Rule who inform him that they shot his best friend Barry which impacts Manuel more than he thought it would.</p><h3>Powers/Abilities:</h3><p>Manuel Lago is an expert trained CIA operative who gained regenerative powers as part of Project Bellator. The regenerative formula would heal any injury, including regrowing lost limbs. It also increased his strength and resilience beyond that of any man and was intended to turn him into an unstoppable one man army. As a side effect of this regenerative ability any part of his body that is removed can grow into a full grown duplicate of Manuel complete with his skills and knowledge and sharing a psychic link with each other and Manuel, their 'father'. The duplicates have varying demeanors and personalities but all share an affinity for that who they spawned from.</p>",

    "deck": "Evil witch and enemy of Sela and Samantha Darren. She is also a foe of the Dark One though they often seemingly work towards the same goal. She has been portrayed almost exclusively as evil, however, on occasion she has worked with others towards a goal which is significantly less evil than, for instance, the Dark One.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p><a href=\"/fel-yaga/4005-85147/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85147\">Fel Yaga</a> was one of the keepers and writers of the journals of <a href=\"/myst/4020-57713/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57713\">Myst</a>. She kept her daughter Baba close by and the two shared a close relationship. Eventually the forces of the <a href=\"/the-dark-one/4005-21701/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21701\">Dark One</a> came for her journal. Fel she resisted and paid for it with her life. Baba witnessed the murder and swore to become an enemy of the Dark One, but also choose a life of evil for herself.</p><p>She once was <a href=\"/shang/4005-21698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21698\">Shang</a>'s star pupil, until he discovered she was a spy for the enemy. He cast her out and imprisoned her in a house in a forest. There she lay in wait and laid traps for humans, so that she could eat them. Her favourite prey were children, but with none often available she instead ate the heroes and champions who sought to slay her. She would then take their bones and create a fence from them. She would later decide that she had only one champion left to vanquish, <a href=\"/alexxa/4005-83605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83605\">Alexxa</a>. Alexxa is hunted down by the Black, White and Red Knights of Baba Yaga, but fought back with the aid of characters from her <a href=\"/selas-fairy-tale-book/4055-57137/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57137\">book</a>. Baba Yaga counter-attacked and Alexxa only had time to return to her house to tell Shang that Baba Yaga was back. He informed her to pass the book on the next bearer, which was <a href=\"/sela/4005-57456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57456\">Sela</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The character was created as an adversary for Sela and first appeared in <a href=\"/grimm-fairy-tales-42-baba-yaga/4000-177525/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-177525\">Grimm Fairy Tales #42.</a></p><p>The initial concept behind the character was based off of that of a witch-like creature from Slavic legends called Baba Yaga, although the Zenescope version is substantially different. Like the Zenescope version though this character is sometimes portrayed as a force for good, even though she has an evil nature.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>She has been portrayed almost exclusively as evil, however, on occasion she and <a href=\"/belinda/4005-57478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57478\">Belinda</a> have worked together towards a goal which is significantly less evil than, for instance, the Dark One.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Baba Yaga is more often seen behind the scenes manipulating others as opposed to being involved directly in the action. Her first major role was in the <a href=\"/the-dream-eater-saga/4045-56602/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56602\">Dream Eater Saga</a> where she decides against the advice of the others to kill the Dark One (though he is saved by a sacrifice of <a href=\"/fenton/4005-83606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83606\">Fenton</a>).</p><p>In the series <a href=\"/grimm-fairy-tales-myths-legends/4050-38514/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-38514\">Grimm Fairy Tales: Myths and Legends</a>, she fills the opposite role as that of <a href=\"/samantha-darren/4005-80285/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80285\">Samantha</a>, and tries to convert other falseblood to the side of evil. She is currently pursuing the shards of an artifact which will return Helios to Earth.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>She is a sorceress of great power and is seemingly immortal. One of the item in her possession is the Cyclops Eye which enchants others and makes them serve her.</p>",

He had searched the main exhibit area, until realizing that the object he is looked for is on the upper floor of the exhibit. After traveling up to the upper floor, he noticed that a policeman protected the area at the entrance, but walks in anyway; not caring that he was still wanted by them. He found the object he was looking for, Sir Francis Drake’s ring and its decoder at the center of the room inside of a display case. He noted down notes the information and images into his journal, also realizing that the only way to open it is to put in a key on a keyhole on the side of the display case. A younger Sully walked in, heading to where the ring was located. Nathan hid beside a box watching Sully inject a key and then leaving. A police man appeared kicking him out of the museum. Nathan pursued Sully along the streets of Cartagena: alerting the people, knocking down food and climbing up structures of the city as he went. Sully had entered a building, Nathan watches Sully get another key from a citizen and then putting in to his wallet. Sully is then accompanied by Marlowe, as they walk down the streets, Nathan taps along once more. Once both had stopped at a merchant, Nathan had stole his wallet. Nathan had walked away slowly, until Sully appeared, after a short conversation with him he gave him back his wallet, but not his key.</p><p>Nathan returned to the museum, this time having the key. Navigating across rooftops he sneaks into the room where the display case storing the ring and its decoder are located. He takes both, but Katherine Marlowe and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80434\" href=\"/victor-sullivan/4005-80434/\">Victor Sullivan</a>, with her armed guards discover him. Marlowe takes away the decoder, but the ring. The act resulted in the guards attacking him. He runs way along the rooftops, until he is faced by one of Marlowe's agents. The agent almost had shoot, but Sully killed him.

The artifact in question is the golden staff of Ayar Manco, which the tribe believe to rightfully belong to them. After retrieving the staff, Nate rescues Alex Munoz, the daughter of the mayor of Guayaquil, who has been kidnapped and held hostage by Valdez. Nate and Alex are chased by Valdez's henchmen through the rainforest and surrender after Nate drives their jeep into a dead end. However, just as Nate and Alex declare their surrender the Cuiqawa tribe appear from the surrounding forestry and ambush Valdez's men. For returning the golden staff of iAyar Manco to the tribe and returning Alex to her father, Nate receives two large monetary rewards.</p><p>Nate in The Fourth Labyrinth. Upon arriving back to America, Nate is contacted by Sully, who makes him aware of the recent murder of their friend Luka Hzujak. After viewing the murder scene, Nate and Sully visit Luka's daughter Jadranka, more commonly known as \"Jada\". Upon their arrival, Jada informs Nate and Sully that she has been going through Luka's research notes; Luka was working at Phoenix Industries, a weapons manufacturer whose CEO is Norwegian businessman Tyr Henriksen, shortly before his murder. Jada believes Henriksen and her stepmother Olivia, who also works at Phoenix Industries, to be behind Luka's murder. However, first Nate, Sully and Jada pay a visit to Dr. Maynard Cheney, a professor who Luka has been working with before his death.</p><p>Arriving at the Museum of Natural History in New York, Nate, Sully and Jada are greeted by graduate student Gretchen Welch, who informs the trio of the recent work being carried out by Luka and Dr. Cheney; the two professors had been researching three ancient labyrinths, all crafted by the legendary Greek figure Daedalus. As Gretchen leads the three visitors through Dr. Cheney's \"Labyrinths of the Ancient World\" exhibit, a ruckus is heard from Dr. Cheney's office. Nate rushes ahead of the others and finds Dr. Cheney dying, having been attacked moments earlier. Nate and Jada give pursuit to the attacker for a short period of time, but it is impossible to catch the perpetrator in the elaborate labyrinth exhibit. Returning to Dr. Cheney's office, Gretchen informs Nate, Sully and Jada that her brother Ian is a manager at the excavation site of the labyrinth of Sobek; a labyrinth in Egypt that Luka had been studying before his murder. Not wanting to meet the police, Nate, Sully and Jada leave the Museum after Gretchen promises to get them access to the Egyptian excavation site through her brother. Nate, Sully and Jada then make their way back to Luka's apartment. However, there they find the apartment on fire and are attacked by mysterious assailants in an SUV. Jada wishes to confront Olivia and Henriksen at the Phoenix Innovation headquarters, but Olivia is unavailable and the trio make their way up America's East Cost, entering Canada before flying to Egypt from Montreal.</p><p>Shortly after arriving in Egypt, Nate, Sully and Jada meet Ian Welch over dinner. Welch tells the trio of the work being carried out at the excavation site of the labyrinth of Sobek in Crocodilopolis, but leaves abruptly when the murders of Luka and Dr. Cheney are mentioned. Olivia Hzujak then appears at the restaurant, having followed Nate, Sully and Jada from their hotel. Jada storms out of the restaurant, unable to talk with the stepmother she despises, and Nate must chase after her. Outside the restaurant, Jada is attacked by a gang of thugs who attempt to kidnap her. With Sully's help, Nate is able to fend the attackers off, but the thugs are soon killed in cold blood by a group of hooded people, who tell Jada that she should go home. The hooded group are later revealed to be the Protectors of the Hidden Word, a secret society set up to hide the mysteries of ancient labyrinths.</p><p>The next day, Nate, Sully and Jada investigate the excavation site with Welch, who informs them that Henriksen has recently bought the company managing the dig and is visiting the site along with Olivia. Welch leads Nate, Sully and Jada into the heart of labyrinth, where Nate discovers a hidden passage below the labyrinth's anteroom. Exploring the passage, they discover three rooms that represent Daedalus' three labyrinths: along with the labyrinth of Sobek in Egypt and the well-known labyrinth of Knossos on the Greek island Crete; a third labyrinth exists on the Greek archipelago Thera, also known as Santorini. Shortly after this, the group are attacked by the Protectors of the Hidden Word, who drag Welch off into a hidden passage. Nate, Sully and Jada are unable to fight off the large group of Protectors, and come across Henriksen and Olivia as they make their escape.</p><p>Nate, Sully and Jada make their way to Thera, where they explore a fortress damaged by earthquakes through the years. Beneath the fortress, they a labyrinth that contains rooms similar to those found in the labyrinth of Sobek. However, there are four room representing four labyrinths, and suddenly Luka's research becomes clear: he was searching for the mythical fourth labyrinth, and the rooms reveal that the fourth labyrinth is in China and known as \"Diyu\", what the Chinese consider to be Hell. As Nate, Sully and Jada escape, they come under attack from more Protectors, who drag Sully away in a manner similar to Welch. Overwhelmed, Nate and Jada retreat, only to be confronted by Henriksen, Olivia and several of Henriksen's hired guns, including his bodyguard Corelli. Henriksen too knows that the fourth labyrinth is in China, and offers Nate and Jada the opportunity to travel with him. Nate and Jada reluctantly agree, before flying to China with Henriksen and his entourage.</p><p>On the flight, Henriksen receives information from an employee at Phoenix Industries that points to Diyu being under the city of Nanjing. Upon their arrival in Nanjing, Nate is introduced to a team of mercenaries that are set to provide security to Henriksen and his associates in Diyu. Soon after entering Diyu, Olivia turns on Henriksen and reveals that she is behind everything. After Nate kills Corelli, Olivia orders the mercenaries to execute Nate, Jada and Henriksen. However, before they can shoot the Protectors of the Hidden Word attack and the ensuing skirmish gives Nate, Jada and Henriksen the chance to escape from Olivia and the mercenaries.</p><p>Moving towards the heart of Diyu, Nate, Jada and Henriksen are attacked by a small group of Protectors, among which are Sully and Welch, who have been brainwashed by a concoction containing the white hellebore. Before Nate is able to stop him, Henriksen shoots and kills Welch. Nate is able to stop Henriksen from shooting Sully, although Sully then attacks Nate and the two fight for a short period of time. Eventually Nate is able to get the better of Sully and subdues his friend, before regrouping with Jada and Henriksen and heading into the heart of the labyrinth, where they are confronted by the \"Minotaur\", which is actually a human man deformed by the same concoction that brainwashed Sully and Welch. Olivia and the remaining mercenaries soon arrive and as the mercenaries engage the Minotaur in battle, Nate, Jada, Henriksen and Sully move onto the treasure vault. Guarding the treasure is the Mistress of the Labyrinth and the final Protectors. As Nate, Jada and Henriksen battle the Protectors, Olivia arrives with the last mercenary Suarez, having seemingly killed the Minotaur. The Mistress kills Henriksen, and Suarez kills the Mistress.

The Eye of Indra was a valuable artifact which holds the secret to the Three Treasures of Indra. Pinkerton shows a piece of paper to Nathan showing the three pieces of Indra. He walks over to a box, unlocking it, hidden there was two of the three pieces of Indra he had possessed: the Path of Indra and the Wrath of Indra.</p><p>While Nate is looking over the documents Pinkerton gave him in a bar, two thugs pick a fight with him. As it escalates, the fight is broken up by Rika, the owner of the bar. Nate asks Rika to help him by translating the documents. In Rika's bedroom, the two discover that the Eye is in fact hidden within the other two treasures, which are locked inside Pinkerton's safe. Rather than inform Pinkerton that he already has the Eye, Nate instead chooses to rob him of the artifact.</p><h3><b>Episode 2</b></h3><p>Nate is still being tortured, and refusing to break. Flashbacks reveal that the next morning, Nate is concerned about allowing Rika to help him rob Pinkerton. To Nate's surprise, Rika reveals she has already told somebody about the job, and as they argue, armed pirates storm through the door and attack. Nate tries to reach for his gun but both he and Rika are apprehended while fighting the intruders. The leader of the pirates enters the room; Eddy Raja, Nate's old rival, and both are equally confused as to how they have met up again. It is revealed that Eddy is the person Rika told about the job, as he is her brother and can provide weaponry. Eddy realizes that Nate and Rika have slept together, prompting him to fly into a rage and threaten to kill Nate.</p><p>Presently, Pinkerton also has Eddy tied to the chair. As Pinkerton prepares to torture them further, Eddy warns Nate not to tell him anything.</p><h3><b>Episode 3</b></h3><p>With everybody calmed down, Nate, Eddy and Rika discuss the plan. Nate demands that they follow his rules if Eddy is to help. After Eddy leaves, Rika apologizes for telling him and asks how they know each other, Nate explains how Eddy had planned to double-cross him on a past job, but he had \"beat him to the punch.\"</p><p>In the present, Pinkerton tortures Eddy, who laughs and hints that he and Nate have an accomplice.</p><p>Flashing back again, some time later, the three gather outside Pinkerton's mansion at night, ready for the heist. Eddy and Nate persuade Rika to stay behind and cover them. To create a distraction, Eddy blows up Pinkerton's cars, and they both sneak into the mansion amid the confusion.</p><p>In the present, Pinkerton has his men bring in Rika, captured, and tells them that they'd be wise to reveal the location of the Eye.</p><h3><b>Episode 4</b></h3><p>Pinkerton threatens to kill Rika, so Nate tells him that the Eye of Indra is hidden in the safe. Returning to the flashback, Nate and Eddy have been discovered in the mansion, and are in a gunfight with Pinkerton's guards. After battling their way through to the office and barracading themselves inside, Eddy plants an explosive on the safe. However, the detonator is broken, and all the others were used on the cars. As they bicker about the situation, Rika informs Nate via wakie-talkie that Pinkerton and more of his goons are headed his way. Shortly after, they are captured.</p><p>With Pinkerton briefly distracted looking at the Eye of Indra, Rika breaks loose and take's Eddy's Golden Gun, which had been concealed beneath a table. She shoots Pinkerton, wounding him. A flashback to forty-five minutes prior reveals Nate had an idea: get caught. Eddy suggests to simply kill the guards, but as Nate was out of bullets, and Eddy only had one clip left, they had no other option. Nate explains to a dying Pinkerton that they needed him to open the safe after the detonator failed, thus his plan was to be interrogated, and for Rika to get herself captured and use the gun they had concealed to kill Pinkerton and his guards. Rika then executes Pinkerton, and the three of them escape.</p><p>Later, the trio stand at a dock discussing a fine job. However, Rika betrays both Nate and Eddy by taking the amulet for herself, holding them at gunpoint and repeating Nate's earlier statement, that she simply \"beat him to the punch\". Nate assures Rika that he will find her, and she replies that she will look forward to it. As they watch her sail away, Eddy orders Nate not to say a word.</p><p>Three days later, Nate relaxes at a beach bar, telling <a data-ref-id=\"Victor_Sullivan\" href=\"/wiki/Victor_Sullivan/\">Victor Sullivan</a> of the recent events. Sully finds the story amusing and tells Nate that he should have known better than to have teamed up with Eddy, or any of his family, but questions how Nate now plans to find Francis Drake's coffin without any money. Nate reveals he does actually have a plan, though he will be needing Sully's help this time. Pointing to a television featuring a report by <a data-ref-id=\"Elena_Fisher\" href=\"/wiki/Elena_Fisher/\">Elena Fisher</a>, Nate tells him he is meeting her tomorrow, and the best part is that Elena's producers have agreed to fund the whole expedition.

Elena is with him to record the events for a documentary. When Nate opens the coffin, they discover a <a data-ref-id=\"Drake%27s_Diary\" href=\"/wiki/Drake%27s_Diary/\">diary</a> written by Sir Francis Drake that points to the location of <a data-ref-id=\"El_Dorado\" href=\"/wiki/El_Dorado/\">Eldorado</a>, the fabled city of gold which Sir Francis was searching for. They also learn that Sir Francis had faked his death, as there was no body in the coffin. Shortly after, pirates appear and start attacking Nate and Elena's boat. Just when the boat is starting to catch fire, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80434\" href=\"/victor-sullivan/4005-80434/\">Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan</a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-80434\" href=\"/victor-sullivan/4005-80434/\">,</a> Nate's old friend and father figure, saves them with his plane and takes them to shore.</p><p>Back on land, Sully and Nate leave Elena behind after fearing that her publishing the documentary would attract rivals and travel to a region in the Amazon, where they find ruins of an ancient South American civilization, and clues that Eldorado is a large gold statue, and that it was removed long ago by the Spaniards. Searching further, Nate and Sully discover a long-abandoned German U-boat stuck in a river containing its dead crew and a missing page from Sir Francis Drake's diary that points to a southern tropic island where Eldorado was likely taken.</p><p>Before they can leave the island, Nate and Sully encounter Gabriel Roman, another treasure hunter who has hired the services of mercenaries led by Atoq Navarro, Roman's lieutenant and an archaeologist with knowledge of the statue. Roman then shoots Sully in the chest and Nate escapes. As he escapes, he encounters Elena, and they then head to Sully's plane and fly to the Pacific Island where the statue is believed to be.</p><h3><b>Plane-wrecked</b></h3><p>Having been shot down near the island and separated, Nate works his way to a fort where he spots Elena's parachute. He is soon captured by the pirates from the beginning of the game, who are revealed to be led by Eddy Raja. Elena rescues Nate and flee the fort from Eddy and his pirates. The two work their way through a long-abandoned port city and discover, through a log book in its custom house, that the statue was moved further inland; as Elena spots the supposedly dead Sully working with Roman and Navarro, heading north, they decide to follow him to the monastery. There they locate hidden passages, and rescue Sully, who survived thanks to Drake's diary blocking the bullet, and played along to fool his captors.</p><p>Nate and Elena find a series of maze-like passages below the monastery. In these tunnels, Nate overhears an argument between Roman, Navarro, and Eddy, who was hired by Roman as well in order to aid in the capture of Nate and the security of the island all with the reward of a share of the gold of Eldorado. Roman doubts Eddy's abilities to do his job further and ignores his superstitious claim that something cursed on the island is killing his men; Roman dismisses Eddy and his crew.</p><h3><b>Going Underground</b></h3><p>Traveling through more of the underground tunnels, Nate and Elena find a passage leading to a large treasure vault in which they find Sir Francis Drake's body, assuming that he died on the island searching for the treasure. Before they move on, they encounter Eddy running for his life, chased by <a data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\" href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\">mutated humans</a> possessing incredible speed and strength called the Descendants. After Eddy is killed by the creatures, Nate and Elena escape and find themselves in an abandoned German submarine base. Nate ventures out into the base to restore power to allow them to leave. During his exploration, he discovers that the Germans had sought the statue during World War II but, like the Spaniards before them, were mutated by the statue. Sir Francis, knowing the statue's power, was actually trying to keep it on the island, before he too was killed by the descendants.</p><h3><b>Showdown</b></h3><p>Nate attempts to return to Elena, but finds her captured by Roman and Navarro. As Nate follows Roman and Navarro to save Elena, he reunites with Sully outside of the monastery. Under the monastery, Nate and Sully are captured at gunpoint and find that Roman has the statue. Navarro urges Roman to open it; inside is the Mummy of <a data-ref-id=\"El_Dorado\" href=\"/wiki/El_Dorado/\">Eldorado</a>. As Roman opens the statue, he inhales an airborne virus that is carried by the rotting corpse and begins to mutate. Navarro shoots the mutating Roman, who planned all along to steal the statue and sell the virus as a weapon. Navarro then has the statue lifted out by helicopter as his mercenaries are attacked by Descendants. Nate jumps onto the net the statue is in and they crash land on a tanker ship. Nate and Navarro fight, knocking him unconscious. After Nate pulls an injured Elena from the helicopter, Navarro regains consciousness; Nate pushes the helicopter off the tanker. The rope connecting the helicopter to the statue, which has become tangled around his leg, plunges Navarro and the statue into the ocean.</p><p>Nate and Elena lean in to kiss but are interrupted by Sully, who arrives on a small speedboat, having escaped the island and taken several boxes of treasure he found in the cave and took from dead pirates. Elena reminds Nate that because she lost her camera, he still owes her a story. As the boat sails towards the horizon, Nate assures her he will not break his promise.</p><h2><b><i>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</i></b></h2><h3><b>Train-wrecked</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2150018-2150017-drake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2150018\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 234px\" data-ratio=\"0.91880341880342\" data-width=\"234\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2150018-2150017-drake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2150018\"><img alt=\"Drake in Among Thieves\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px\" data-width=\"234\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2150018-2150017-drake.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2150018-2150017-drake.jpg 234w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Drake in Among Thieves\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2150018-2150017-drake.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2150018-2150017-drake.jpg 234w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px\" data-width=\"234\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Drake in Among Thieves</figcaption></figure><p>The story begins <i>in medias res</i>, with a wounded Nate waking up to find himself in a train hanging off a cliff. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that, roughly two years after the events of <i>Drake's Fortune</i>, Harry Flynn and Chloe Frazer approached him with a job offer to steal a Mongolian oil lamp in an Istanbul museum. Nate accepts the job when he learns that the lamp may lead to the treasures in Marco Polo's lost fleet. Flynn and Drake acquire the lamp, which contains a map showing that the lost fleet had been transporting the Cintamani Stone from Shambhala before being thrown ashore in Borneo by a tsunami. Taking the map, Flynn double-crosses Drake, who is arrested and imprisoned for three months before Chloe, who claims to have had no knowledge of Flynn's treachery, asks for the help of Drake's friend Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan to secure his release.</p><h3><b>Borneo</b></h3><p>Nate and <a data-ref-id=\"Sully\" href=\"/wiki/Sully/\">Sully</a> follow Flynn and his boss <a data-ref-id=\"Zoran_Lazarevic\" href=\"/wiki/Zoran_Lazarevic/\">Zoran Lazarevic</a>, a war criminal who is widely thought to be dead, to Borneo. With the help of Chloe working within Lazarevic's camp as a mole, they discover that the lost fleet never actually possessed the Cintamani Stone. They locate a tomb containing the bodies of Polo's passengers, as well as a Tibetan phurba and another letter from Polo saying that the next clue is in one of the temples in Nepal. While Sullivan decides that the quest is too risky for him to carry on, Nate and Chloe head to Nepal, finding the city in the midst of civil war as Lazarevic ravages the city looking for the right temple.</p><h3><b>Urban Warfare</b></h3><p>En route to the temple, the pair runs into Elena Fisher and her cameraman Jeff, who are tracking down Lazarevic to find proof to show to the public that he is in fact still alive. The four reach the temple and discover that the stone and Shambhala are in the Himalayas. Just as they are about to leave the group is ambushed outside the temple, and Jeff is shot by one of Lazarevic's men. Despite Chloe's insistence to leave Jeff behind, the group pushes on further until they are finally caught by Flynn and Lazarevic. Chloe reluctantly pulls her gun on Nate to protect her \"cover\", while Lazarevic executes Jeff. Lazarevic and Chloe then leave for a train, but Nate and Elena manage to escape just as Flynn is about to kill them. The couple rushes to the train yard and catch up with the leaving train on a stolen jeep. Nate boards the train and finds Chloe, who is upset about Nate having taken Elena and Jeff along earlier and refuses to leave with him. As the two argue Flynn suddenly arrives and shoots Nate in the abdomen. With no other option, Nate shoots a pile of propane tanks, killing Flynn's men but sending Nate's half of the train towards a steep cliff.</p><p>Returning to where the story began, Nate escapes the train and travels through a snow storm, falling unconscious. He wakes up in a Tibetan village, where he is reunited with Elena and is introduced to a German man named Karl Schäfer. Schäfer tells Nate that the phurba is the key to finding Shambhala, but Nate tells Schäfer he is no longer interested. Schäfer sends Nate and the village leader, Tenzin, to find the remains of the men in his expedition, who were looking for Shambhala and the stone 70 years earlier.</p><h3><b>Heart of Ice</b></h3><p>Traveling through a series of ice caves to an ancient temple filled with yeti-like creatures, Nate and Tenzin discover that Schäfer's men were SS members on an Ahnenerbe expedition and that he had killed them to protect the world from the power of the stone. They return to find Lazarevic's men attacking the village. After securing the village, Nate and Elena find out that Schäfer has been kidnapped and the couple track Lazarevic's convoy to an abandoned monastery. The two locate a mortally wounded Schäfer, who tells Nate that he must destroy the Cintamani Stone.</p><h3><b>The Road to Shambhala</b></h3><p>Nate and Elena use the phurba to unlock the secret passage to Shambhala underneath the monastery, but Lazarevic corners them and forces Nate to open the gate. When the gate opens the group is attacked by the monsters from the ice caves, but Lazarevic manages to kill them off and reveals that they are actually the Guardians of Shambhala, powered by the Cintamani stone and dressed like monsters to scare off anyone who trespass the city. Just as Lazarevic prepares to kill both Elena and Nate, another wave of Guardians attacks which allows them and Chloe to escape.</p><p>Making their way to the stone, Nate discovers that the stone is in fact a giant amber of petrified blue resin embedded in a giant Tree of Life. As they prepare to go after Lazarevic, a wounded Flynn arrives and detonates a grenade, killing himself and seriously wounding Elena. Nate leaves Elena in Chloe's care and sets off to confront Lazarevic at the tree. Nate arrives just as Lazarevic drinks the tree's sap, which heals his scars and renders him nearly indestructible. Detonating the pockets of explosive resin in the tree, Nate defeats Lazarevic and leaves him to be killed by the Guardians. Nate reunites with Chloe and Elena and they escape the city as a series of explosions begins to destroy Shambhala.</p><p>Back in the village, Chloe asks Nate if he loves Elena. He does not deny it, and Chloe bids Nate goodbye as Sully carries a recovering Elena over to him. While Sully chases after Chloe, Elena and Nate pay their respects at Schäfer's grave before embracing. They share a kiss and together they walk over to the edge of a cliff and watch the sun set behind the mountains as he mentions he is afraid of clowns.</p><h2><b><i>Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception</i></b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2069199-250px_nateu3render.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2069199\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 250px\" data-ratio=\"1.544\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2069199-250px_nateu3render.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2069199\"><img alt=\"Nathan in Uncharted 3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2069199-250px_nateu3render.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2069199-250px_nateu3render.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nathan in Uncharted 3\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2069199-250px_nateu3render.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/2069199-250px_nateu3render.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nathan in Uncharted 3</figcaption></figure><p>Nathan Drake along with Victor Sullivan head to the <a data-ref-id=\"Pelican_Inn\" href=\"/wiki/Pelican_Inn/\">Pelican Inn</a> located in <a data-ref-id=\"London\" href=\"/wiki/London/\">London</a>. They meet up with <a data-ref-id=\"Charlie_Cutter\" href=\"/wiki/Charlie_Cutter/\">Charlie Cutter</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"Talbot\" href=\"/wiki/Talbot/\">Talbot</a> to trade <a data-ref-id=\"Francis_Drake%27s_Ring\" href=\"/wiki/Francis_Drake%27s_Ring/\">Francis Drake’s Ring</a> in exchange for money. Nathan and Sully inspect the money, realizing that it was scam; they brawl with the surrounding <a data-ref-id=\"Hired_Thugs\" href=\"/wiki/Hired_Thugs/\">thugs</a> and Charlie as Talbot leaves the building. When they come out the building, <a data-ref-id=\"Katherine_Marlowe\" href=\"/wiki/Katherine_Marlowe/\">Katherine Marlowe shows up and</a> rips off his ring with <a data-ref-id=\"Katherine_Marlowe%27s_umbrella\" href=\"/wiki/Katherine_Marlowe%27s_umbrella/\">her umbrella.</a> Afterwards Charlie shoots the two, making her agitate Marlowe, but not Talbot.</p><p>When Marlowe leaves, Nathan and Sully get up at Cutter's signal; indicating that Nathan, Sully and Cutter were working together the whole time and Cutter was just a double agent for an unknown amount of time. Nathan, Sully and Cutter continue to pursue the fleeing Marlowe and Talbot who are heading to a hidden underground library. On the way there, <a data-ref-id=\"Chloe_Frazer\" href=\"/wiki/Chloe_Frazer/\">Chloe Frazer</a> steps out of a parked van and rendezvous with the three. This indicates that Chloe is also in on the plan and it is later stated that she is the getaway driver.</p><p>Once Nathan, Sully and Cutter (with Chloe waiting in the van) catch up with Marlowe and her affiliates in their underground lair, they wait for Marlowe to leave, allowing Nathan to capture the journal of <a href=\"/index.php?title=T.E._Lawerence&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1/\">T.E. Lawerence</a> (A.K.A. Lawrence of Arabia) and a <a data-ref-id=\"Francis_Drake%27s_ring_decoder\" href=\"/wiki/Francis_Drake%27s_ring_decoder/\">cipher disk</a> made by John Dee. A message in Lawrence's journal is translated on the cipher disk to reveal \"LONGHIDDEN.\" Nathan, knowing it's an anagram immediately, deciphers the message to see that the message is \"Golden Hind\" Francis Drake's ship. Discovering the clue, they begin searching the library for a trace of the Golden Hind and they find the figurehead of The Golden Hind in the library. Inside of it, they find a map left by Francis Drake. After the discovery, they are ambushed by Marlowe's men, they make a quick escape to Chloe's van where she is already waiting for them. After boarding the van, they escape successfully and retreat to their hideout to sort out the evidence further.</p><p>Nathan said that <a data-ref-id=\"Sir_Francis_Drake\" href=\"/wiki/Sir_Francis_Drake/\">Sir Francis Drake</a> along with John Dee were hired by Queen Elizabeth to go Arabia to look for a lost city. T.E Lawrence said that in Rub’ al Khali desert laid a city with immeasurable wealth called <i>The Atlantis of the Sands</i>. He had also been documenting sites that he went to, the only two that were visited by him and the crusaders, who were also looking for the lost city were France and Syria.</p><h3><span>The Chateau</span></h3><p>Nathan along with Sully once more travel to another location, eastern France that hides an old building called the <a data-ref-id=\"Chateau\" href=\"/wiki/Chateau/\">Chateau</a>; before they can get to the main courtyard they travel through its forest. Once Nathan killed Talbot’s men patrolling the courtyard, he and Sully head into the main building, then into a underground lair. They find an amulet that was stored inside a coffin; they suggest that the object will tell exact location where they should go in <a data-ref-id=\"Yemen\" href=\"/wiki/Yemen/\">Yemen</a>. Talbot comes in, telling one of his agents, <a data-ref-id=\"Harris\" href=\"/wiki/Harris/\">Harris</a> to retrieve the object from Nathan. Nathan tries to punch him, resulting in Talbot shooting him, but not killing him. He ends up giving him the amulet, but when he does <a data-ref-id=\"Spiders\" href=\"/wiki/Spiders/\">spiders</a> come from the walls killing Harris. Nathan along with Sully and Talbot survive the spiders. Nate and Sully manage to get away but when they get back to the main building, Talbot orders his men to burn down the chateau in an attempt them. They barely escape, and knowing that Talbot will probably go to Syria and hurt Chloe and Cutter, they also head to <a data-ref-id=\"Syria\" href=\"/wiki/Syria/\">Syria</a>.</p><h3><span>The Citadel</span></h3><p>They find Chloe and Cutter around the castle in Syria, Charlie shows Nathan a book telling that Queen Elizabeth owned a Hermetic secret spy society, who all wanted one thing; to control their enemies and gain power with that, and what Marlowe is a part of. The book also has writing that says ‘As Above, so below’ and a symbol to go with that, that is located on top of the highest tower. Once they find the symbol they use the constellations to guide them to the crusader’s hidden entrance. One their way, Talbot <a data-ref-id=\"Talbot%27s_Drug\" href=\"/wiki/Talbot%27s_Drug/\">drugs</a> Charlie, taking his gun and journal and then disappearing quietly. Charlie drugged says to Nate the “Wand of the Magician”, which was symbol located on the wall. They push the middle out-even wall part, allowing them to travel to where the second piece of the object is located. Nate, Sully, Chloe and Cutter get detected by Talbot’s man making them run, they end up jumping along a long piece of wood, but when Nate runs along it, he breaks it. This making it impossible for Cutter to jump and get where the rest are, Marlowe and Talbot come taking the second object from him, and then starting a fire. Charlie jumps off the tower, breaking his foot. They help Charlie out of the Citadel and steal a tourist bus, allowing them to escape with Talbot and his men in pursuit.</p><h3><span>Yemen</span></h3><p>Afterwards, both Chloe and Charlie leave the adventure, leaving Nathan and Sully to carry on alone. They board a plane to Yemen, <a data-ref-id=\"Arabian_Peninsula\" href=\"/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula/\">Arabian Peninsula</a> and meet up with Elena Fisher, who gives the pair journalist permits, allowing them access to the city. As they leave the airport, Elena questions Nate's motivation and expresses her concern for Sully, but Nate is more interested by the fact that she is still wearing her wedding ring from their estranged marriage. She claims it 'helps in this part of the world'. Later Elena leads the pair into the city, but as they make their way toward the old district they find their way has been blocked by the cities police. As the group make their way around the blockade Nate sees Talbot, and follows him into a hotel. Talbot ambushes Nate, punching him before throwing him out of a window, an event Nate considers worth it, as he is able to recover the journal stolen form Charlie in Syria. Fighting through a group of <a data-ref-id=\"Katherine_Marlowe%27s_agents\" href=\"/wiki/Katherine_Marlowe%27s_agents/\">Marlowe's thugs</a> before re-grouping with Sully and Elena, Nate stumbles upon the entrance they had come to the city to find, an ancient cistern. After navigating their way through a series of puzzles they find a brasier that, once lit, displayed a constellation, their guide to the <a data-ref-id=\"Iram_of_the_Pillars\" href=\"/wiki/Iram_of_the_Pillars/\">Atlantis of the Sands</a>. As they leave the underground area, Talbot drugs Nate. Hallucinating, Nate pushes Sully and Elena away and follows Talbot's voice until he finally blacks out.</p><p>Marlowe, Talbot and a <a data-ref-id=\"Rameses\" href=\"/wiki/Rameses/\">pirate</a>. Marlowe begins recounting Nate’s life, Nate tries to act as though he isn't bothered, but is terrified to see that Marlowe has full details on Elena. Marlowe promises that nothing will happen to his estranged wife, if he helps them locate Victor Sullivan. When Nate refuses, Marlowe goes on to explain that, though he has been missing for hours, Sully hasn't tried to find him. Despondent, Nate sits in silence as Marlowe informs him that they have apprehended Sully, removing him from the equation. With a growing sense of desperation, Nate breaks the table, and runs after Talbot, following him through the streets and buildings of the market district, eventually catching up with him in a private garden. After a brutal fight, Nate is knocked out by the pirate, Rameses.</p><h3><span>Abducted</span></h3><p>Nate is transported, whilst unconscious, to a derelict ship by Rameses. Awakening as a coarse bag is pulled from his head, Nate learns from the pirate that Marlowe had paid a large fee to have him killed, but the pirate decided to spare him, as long as he reveals the location of the Iram of the Pillars. Nate claims he does not know, but Rameses does not believe him, and as his men step forward to torture Nate for the information, the pirate adds that maybe his friend will be more cooperative. Nate asks 'who?', desperatly fearing for Elena and Sully's safety after he was knocked out. Rameses claims to hold Victor Sullivan, and threatens Nate with the fact that Sully might not be able to hold out under the interrogation before leaving. Fighting his way free Nate finds himself in the middle of a floating derelict ship yard. Fighting his way through the skeleton ships, Nate eventually spots Rameses making his way to a cruise liner, believing that is where Sully is being held, he follows the pirate aboard the, once glamorous, cruise ship, and makes his way to the hold. There he find, what appears to be Sully tied to a chair, but is in fact just a trap. Rameses appears and order one of his men to tie Nate up, but Nate swipes the henchman’s weapons, and after shooting Rameses he throws a grenade, causing water to pour in and begin to flood the ship.</p><p>As he tries to escape the sinking ship, Nate is confronted by a mortally wounded Rameses who, determined to have revenge, shoots what had once been a glass ceiling, causing a tidal wave of water. With seconds to spare Nate is able to find a way out of the stricken vessel before it is claimed by the sea.</p><h3><span>Stowaway</span></h3><p>Waking on a beach, Nate soon realises he is back in Yemen, and makes his way to Elena's apartment. Elena was overjoyed to see Nate, believing him to be dead. She runs to him and hugs him fiercly, holding him for a time. Nate says that he 'thought this was frowned upon' (physical contact in Yemen) referring to when Sully went to hug Elena when they arrived and she told him that the country frowned upon it and they shouldn't as not to attract attention. She tells him to 'shut up'. She leads him to the sofa and pulls him on to her lap. She updates him on Sullivan's situation: he, Marlowe, and her crew are in a convoy heading into the desert. Marlowe had a two day start, so catching up to them on foot oe making a supply drop to the convoy, so she planned on sneaking onto the plane, dropping in on the convoy, and rescuing Sullivan on her own. However, she and Nate decided to save Sullivan together. Since the plane wasn't taking off until dawn, Elena insisted Nate rest. Nate asked Elena if she planned on rescuing Sullivan by herself, to which she replied she'd do anything to save him. Nate deeply appreciated that. She starts to stroke his hair while he, exhausted, tries to say he likes the way she thinks but can barely get the words out due to his fatigue. Elena simply responds, 'I know'. As he drifted off into sleep, he took Elena's left hand (the one with the wedding band on it), and apologized, with Elena simply responding 'I know' again.Early the next morning, Nate and Elena drive to the airport and make their way toward the cargo plane, facing fierce opposition along the way. Eventually only a tall gate stands in their way. Noticing an empty <a data-ref-id=\"Jeep\" href=\"/wiki/Jeep/\">jeep</a> parked nearby, Nate tells Elena to keep watch as he climbs to the top of the gate, promising to give her a hand from there. Instead he climbs over alone, and tells her to take the jeep and get out of there, stating that he couldn't risk losing her, as he almost had before. After watching Elena get in the jeep, Nate dodged a hail of bullets</p><p>and trying to catch the plane as it taxis down the runway, he was pleased to see Elena speed across the tarmac, allowing him to grab a hold of the jeep and jump to the planes landing gear just as it took off.</p><p>Hidden inside the plane's hold, Nate crawls through the ventilation shafts, but is quickly detected by one of Marlowe's agents. Nate is pulled from the vent and beaten by the thug, who opens the cargo bay door. Nate eventually gaining the upper hand and releasing some of the cargo to knock his attacker out of the plane, unfortunatley it also takes Nate with it. The cargo wire snags however, giving Nate the chance to climb back inside the plane. Once Nate makes it back, more guards arrive as the plane's engines begin to catch fire, due to excess strain put on them and the rest of the plane from the ramp door being open. Eventually, an explosion on the plane creates a huge hole in the side of the plane, sucking out the enemy guards. As Nate tries to resist, the hole grows bigger and he too is sucked out into the air, freefalling to the desert below.</p><h3><span>The Rub' al Khali</span></h3><p>Nate is able to grab a cargo box in mid-air and pulls the cargo's parachute, landing a short distance from the plane crash he makes his way to the wreckage, desperately seeking water. He finds nothing, except for a <a data-ref-id=\"KAL_7\" href=\"/wiki/KAL_7/\">KAL 7</a>, with it he starts a voyage through hundreds of miles of desert, knowing that it is unlikely he will return alive. He soon stumbles across a well filled with only sand. Soon, through the heat of the desert, dehydration &amp; exhaustion start to take there toll causing him to see a mirage of an oasis, this starts to play havoc with his mind, and Nate starts to see hallucinations of the captured Sully. Days after crashing and close to death he stumbles upon what appears to be civilization.</p><p>Once closer though, he realizes it is an <a data-ref-id=\"The_Settlement_%28location%29\" href=\"/wiki/The_Settlement_%28location%29/\">abandoned town</a>. Hoping to find anything he stagger through the sand to reach the gate, finding it barred he crashes through a ceiling as he tried to find an alternate route into the town. Searching he finds the remains of a well, climbing down he finds a small water hole, but after taking a mouthful he realizes it was undrinkable. After climbing back out, Nate smashes through the door and finds himself facing multiple groups of Marlowe's agents. After a lengthy gunfight, <a data-ref-id=\"Salim\" href=\"/wiki/Salim/\">Salim</a>, the Sheikh of the tribe rescues him, first accusing him of being one of Marlowe henchmen, and then accepting that he is just a lost person in need of help.</p><p>Salim takes Nathan to his refugee camp, telling him that his scouts have been tracking down Marlowe's convoy for two days. Nate explains how Marlowe has Sully and in turn explains that Sully knows the location to the lost city of Iram. Salim tells Nate how the city was cursed three thousand years ago when Solomon took control of and commanded the power of the spirits of Dijnn. Afterwards, many Dijnn rebelled; agitating Solomon, he imprisoned them in a brass vessel, letting it plummet down into the water of the city.</p><p>Salim along with Nathan did not want Marlowe to take out the vessel and unleashing the evil, decide to take out the cargo trucks going to the city on <a data-ref-id=\"Horses\" href=\"/wiki/Horses/\">horseback</a>. In the process, Nathan is able to reunite with Sully after they get him out of one of the trucks. Afterwards, when they are in a close distance to the city, they lose contact with Salim. Horseback is no longer needed, only using the weapons around them to execute the guards patrolling the place.</p><h3><span>The Atlantis of the Sands</span></h3><p>Nathan along with Sully travel to the City of Brass using the main entrance to enter the city. The two explore the are coming across a fountain, Nathan drinks some of the water and Sully washes his face with water too. Nathan imagines that Talbot killed Sully with a T-Bolt Sniper after an eclipse.</p><p>He imagined that he was chasing Talbot again, but that didn't happen, it was just an hallucination. Talbot was all that time with Katherine, trying to get what's in the water, a brass jar. He wakes up joining up with Sully again, he realizes he drank the cursed water making him have a hallucination. He now also knows that when Francis Drake came to the city, he knew about the cursed water, when he came back to report Queen Elizabeth he said there was nothing. Then Francis had wiped out all his evidence of the city.</p><p>Nathan arrive at the location, where Marlowe and her henchmen extract the hallucinogenic brass vessel from the water of the city. They decide to separate to try to flank them. Sully goes to where Talbot is located and he goes behind an entrance. Talbot notices Nathan, aiming his pistol at him; Sully at the exact same moment surprises him from behind. Talbot manages to overcome him, and is also able to knock him into the water, Nathan jumping after him.</p><p>He shoots towards the surface from under water, being able to destroy the crane lifting up the vessel. Surrounding henchmen shoot at him and Sully, as they ran away from the crumbling city. Afterwards, Marlowe and Talbot catch up to them, where Talbot will try to shoot Nathan, but fails. The floor Marlowe stands on, collapses trapping her in the quicksand and Talbot is unable to reach her. Nathan being persuaded by Marlowe helps her get out, but Nathan is unable to save her and Francis Drake’s Ring.</p><p>Talbot is able to survive the collapse of the floor, letting him get further to where he and Sully are. On the edge of a platform, Talbot attacks him with a knife, stunning him. Nathan fails, but is able to hold on the edge of the platform. Talbot further tries to kill him by stepping on his hand making him lose his grip, Talbot get distracted letting Nathan get back up. Sully shoots Talbot with a Para 9, the ground moves once more having an effect on Nathan. He falls, but is able to grab the edge and then Sully’s Para 9. Talbot almost kills sully with a rock, but Nathan shoots him with Sully’s gun. He falls down at the end of the cliff were Talbot dies.</p><p>Once they are out of the city, Salim's men help them get out of the area.</p><p>Nathan and Sully arrive at an airport; leaving it Sully tells him that a person does not get to choose how they start in this life, and that real greatness is what you do with the hand you are dealt with and then gives him his wedding ring which he thought he had lost. He then gestured to Elena, who had arrived at the airport. Elena stated that she was sorry about Drake losing Sir Francis Drake's ring, which Drake said was \"all right\" because he traded it for \"something better\", letting her see that he was wearing his retrieved wedding ring, the two decided to leave Yemen together with Sullivan hand in hand.

    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>Victor Sullivan was created by <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/naughty-dog-inc/65-827/\">Naughty Dog, Inc</a> as one of the supporting characters of their <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/uncharted/62-957/\">Uncharted</a> video game series. His first appearance was in <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/uncharted-drakes-fortune/61-13992/\">Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</a>, released on Sony's Playstation 3 in 2007. Sullivan would make his first comic appearance is in the Uncharted mini series written by <a href=\"../../joshua-williamson/26-56513/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joshua Williamson</a>, published by DC Comics.</p><h2><span id=\"Biography\">Biography</span></h2><p>Victor Sullivan commented that he had a lousy father and childhood, and he was never interested in starting his own family-- that is until Nathan Drake came into his life.</p><p>Sullivan commented that as a young adult, he was in the navy. By the time Sullivan was forty years old, he was a free lance thief, taking contracts and stealing objects for a price. He came under the patronage of Katherine Marlowe, whom he developed a romantic relationship with. While attempting to steal Sir Francis Drake's ring and astrolabe in Colombia, a teenaged Nathan Drake caught into his plan, and stole his wallet. Sullivan knew Drake was following, and assumed Nate thought he was an easy mark. Nevertheless, Sullivan treated Drake with a fatherly concern, asking him where his parents were, which solicited a cold response from Drake.</p><p>Sullivan let Drake go, but Nate made his way back to the museum to try to steal the ring before Sullivan. However, Drake was soon cornered by Marlowe, Sullivan, and her guards. Drake surrendered the astrolabe to Marlowe, but refused to give her the ring. Marlowe began to beat Drake, which shocked Sullivan. He attempted to restrain her, and Drake ran away. Sullivan protected Nate from Marlowe's men, and eventually gunned down a guard who cornered Drake. Sullivan brought Drake to an inn, and fed him. The two discussed Sir Francis Drake and his astrolabe. Drake believed Sir Francis was charged with a secret mission from Queen Elizabeth, and the astrolabe hid whatever he found. Without the ring, the astrolabe could not be opened, so the situation reached a stalemate.</p><p>Sullivan, impressed by Nate's free running abilities and interest in history, offered to take him under his wing in order to get him off the streets. Nate agreed, and finally introduced himself as Nathan Drake.</p><p>Throughout the years, Nate and Sullivan often got into dangerous situations, even jail time. Despite these hitches, Sullivan raised and protected Nate like his own son, and stood by him even when his actions got them into trouble. Nate grew to love Sullivan as his father, and became very protective of him as time went on. He later showed great concern for Nathan's well-being when he became 'reckless' during Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception</p><h3><span id=\"Uncharted:_Golden_Abyss\"><i>Uncharted: Golden Abyss</i></span></h3><p>Sully has been will to appear in the upcoming PS Vita title.</p><h3><span id=\"Uncharted:_Drake.27s_Fortune\"><i>Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</i></span> <span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Victor_Sullivan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3/\"></a></span></h3><p>Sullivan is Nathan's partner for the early part of the game, and is trusted by Nate with the secret of <a data-ref-id=\"Sir_Francis_Drake\" href=\"/wiki/Sir_Francis_Drake/\" slug=\"wiki\">Sir Francis Drake</a>'s journal containing the whereabouts of <a data-ref-id=\"El_Dorado\" href=\"/wiki/El_Dorado/\" slug=\"wiki\">El Dorado</a>. The two travel to the treasures location on Sully's yacht alone, leaving behind <a data-ref-id=\"Elena_Fisher\" href=\"/wiki/Elena_Fisher/\" slug=\"wiki\">Elena Fisher</a> since she, as a reporter, threatened to let others know of what they were after. Nate and Sully find the temple of El Dorado picked clean; Sully complains, stating that he \"was really counting on this one\" and was \"up to his eyeballs in debt.\" They follow the trail to a German U-Boat, where Sully stays behind because he was spooked by the decrepit submarine. When Drake returns, he discovers that Sully has let Gabriel Roman know about their expedition in order to reassure him the debt would be paid. Roman takes the map from Drake and shoots Sully in the chest.</p><p>Sully is discovered to be alive when Elena captures footage of him entering a helicopter with Roman and Navarro. Suspicious that he may have been working for them all along, Elena and Nate chase after him to the monastery. When Nate and Elena find Sully in the library, he explains that he has been preoccupying the Mercenaries this whole time trying to keep them from finding the treasure vault. He earned their trust in order to stay alive long enough to be rescued, while continuing the search for the treasure on his own. When asked how he survived the gunshot, he reveals that Francis Drake's journal (which Nate gave him to hang on to) blocked the bullet.</p><p>Sully stays with Elena while Nate searched for the Treasure Vault; he later diverts the Mercenaries away from the vault and meets Drake there, only to be separated again shortly after by a booby trap. Sully attempts to contact Drake over the radio but his messages are frequently broken up; by the time Drake reestablishes contact, he is under enemy gunfire and needs Drake's help. After dispatching the enemies in the courtyard, Nate urges him that they find El Dorado before its curse can be unleashed. Sully is skeptical at first, until he and Drake see Roman transformed by the idol. In further shock by the sudden appearance of the mutants, Sully helps Drake reach the treasure before it is airlifted out of the cave. He stays behind in the cave fighting the mutants, and doesn't reappear until the very end, dirty and beat up by his encounter. While Nate and Elena were disappointed that they were going to leave the island empty-handed, Sully reveals that his yacht was containing a large quantity of treasure stolen from Eddy's dead pirate gang.</p><h3><span id=\"Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves\"><i>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</i></span> <span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Victor_Sullivan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4/\"></a></span></h3><p>Sullivan plays a much smaller role in <i>Among Thieves</i> compared with his role in <i>Drake's Fortune</i>. In <i>Among Thieves</i>, after <a data-ref-id=\"Nathan_Drake\" href=\"/wiki/Nathan_Drake/\" slug=\"wiki\">Nathan Drake</a> is put in jail in Turkey, Sullivan arrives and bails him out using both his and Drake's money (assumed to be the treasure they stole from the pirates in the first Uncharted). Chloe Frazer had helped him find Drake, who comes with Sullivan to Drake's cell. Sullivan tells Drake that Harry Flynn has found Marco Polo's ships in Borneo, but that he has not yet found the Cintamani Stone. Sully then tells him that Flynn's client is Zoran Lazarevic, who have been working together all along. They soon make a plan where Chloe will distract Lazaravic's camp with explosives and then Drake and Sullivan will sneak into the camp and look at Lazarevic's files to see if they can find where the stone is.</p><p>In Borneo, Drake and Sullivan arm explosive charges around Lazarevic's camp. When they are all armed, they detonate them, resulting in Lazarevic leaving the camp to find out what happened. Sullivan and Drake then sneak in the camp, with Drake going into Lazarevic's tent while Sullivan watches for soldiers. From the files, Drake learns that the stone is not in Borneo, and that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19192\" href=\"/marco-polo/4005-19192/\" slug=\"marco-polo\">Marco Polo</a> never had the stone. What Lazarevic is looking for is Shambhala, and is trying to pick up Marco Polo's trail back to Shambhala because the stone is still there. They decide to head to a nearby mountain to see if the bodies of Marco Polo's crew are there. After a gunfight with Lazarevic's men, Drake and Sully head to the mountain and meet up with Chloe.</p><p>At the mountain, they find a tomb with hundreds of dead bodies, the resting place of Marco Polo's crew. Inside, they find a Phurba and a map that says that a temple in Nepal has a secret path to Shambhala, which would only be revealed to the person with the 'golden passport' (the Phurba). They then leave the tomb, though Chloe betrays them to Flynn and Lazarevic's men. Flynn learns about the temple in Nepal and tells Chloe to take Drake and Sullivan to Lazarevic. Along the way, Chloe shoots and kills two soldiers who were escorting Drake and Sullivan. Drake and Sullivan try to escape from Flynn and Lazarevic's men as they chase them. They finally escape them by jumping off a cliff into a river. After escaping, Sullivan states to Drake that the stakes this time are too high for a man his age, so he's going to go somewhere warm while Drake meets with Chloe in Nepal, although where he briefly vacations is unknown.</p><p>Sullivan doesn't appear again until the last chapter in Tibet, where he helps carry an injured Elena Fisher outside to Drake. Sullivan expresses his disappointment over Drake not obtaining the Cintamani Stone and then leaves him and Elena alone as he chases after Chloe.</p><p>Victor Sullivan also appears in the Uncharted 2 Multiplayer mode. His costume he wears when he first meets with Drake in the jail is available from the start. Borneo Sullivan, UDF (Uncharted Drake's Fortune) Sullivan, and Winter Sullivan are available in the Sidekick Skin Pack.</p><h3><span id=\"Uncharted_3:_Drake.27s_Deception\"><i>Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception</i></span> <span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Victor_Sullivan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5/\"></a></span></h3><p>Sullivan returns in Uncharted 3 as he and Nate are exploring the deserts of Arabia and is said to have a very major role in the game. He is first seen with Nate walking to a local bar, where the two make an exchange with Talbot and Cutter. The deal all goes well until Nate catches Talbot trying to trade Nate and Sully counterfeit bills in exchange for Nate's ring. The two get into fist fights with Cutter and several other men. After the fight the two try to escape the bar by going through the back door, only to encounter Cutter and more men. The two get beaten hard down and are encountered by Katherine Marlow. Sully had known Marlow from previous events, and is soon shot by Cutter after Nate is.</p><p>20 years earlier, Sully is seen at the Francis Drake museum, trying to get the shape of a lock for the case with the cypher and Drake's ring, with some molding substance, ulimately ubtaining the shape of the key he needs. He is followed by Nate to a locksmith where he gets a key, made in the exact shape of the lock. Several moments later, he is seen walking with Marlow, walking to a ticket booth, where he is robbed of his wallet by Nate. He eventually realized it was taken, and encountered Nate, commenting him on his skills, and then threatening to call the police if Nate didn't give it back. Nate gives it back but takes the key from his wallet. He is then seen with Marlow again and a few armed guards at the museum, catching Nate with the cypher and the ring. Nate mananged to get away and Sully can be seen holding a guard back, letting Nate get away during the chase. Nate got cornered on a rooftop by a guard, both of them holding each other at gunpoint, however Nate was scared and also fell pointing the gun, as the guard was about to kill Nate, he himself is shot in the back by Sully. Sully then took Nate to a local tavern, buying him dinner, and explaining his purpose in all of this. He offers his help, thus starting a long-time friendship with Nate.</p><p>Returning back to current time, he and Nate get up after getting shot by Cutter, only for them to be wearing bullet-proof vests and Cutter to have been in league witht them the whole time. The three escape the alley and meet up with Chloe, searching for a car that belonged to Marlow. When they reached the garage, the car was missing, only to find clues leading into an underground tunnel. Several scenes later, Cutter, Nate, and Sully eavesdrop on Talbot and Marlow trying to solve the cypher with the forged ring, and discover it was fake. After the two leave, Nate discovered the golden hind, uncovering a map inside and the three then escape with Chloe.</p><p>The four meet back at a hideout making a plan, spliting up Sully and Nate go to France, and Cutter and Chloe head to Syria. They find a mansion, and underground the two unlock a tomb in they find an amulet, leading to the Atlantis of the Sands. While the two try to escape, they encounter Talbot, who then takes the amulet and then escapes, while Sully and Nate are trapped by a swarm of spiders, but eventually make it out. As they try to leave the mansion, Talbot's men attempt to burn the whole mansion down, and are successful in doing so, but the two make it out alive. Sully then starts asking Nate if the whole hunt for treasure was worth all the trouble they had been going through, but they both agree to continue. Nate suddenly realizes that since they were followed, Cutter and Chloe may have to.</p><p>They make it to Syria, only to find Talbot's men already there. They eventually run into Chloe and Cutter, warning them about Talbot's men, and so the four search on for the other amulet. While Chloe, Nate, and Sully try to unlock a secert stone passage, Talbot drugs Cutter by shooting him with a dart, telling him to not trust Drake. As soon as they get into the tomb, Cutter, being claustrophobic and drugged, freaks out and then starts getting into a fist-fight with Nate and then attempting to choke Nate to death. Sully and Chloe try to pull Cutter off, but is too strong. Sully then reserted to shoot Cutter in the head to make him stop, but Chloe then convinced Cutter that he was killing Nate and then stopped. Sully then starts to not trust Cutter anymore. The four uncover the last tomb, and attempt to make it out of the kingdom, but then are stopped by Talbot and Marlow. They are shot at by several guards but make it out alive, with Cutter breaking his leg, from a far jump. The four leave the area, using a tour bus and then Chloe starts to question Nate on whenther or not it is really worth all the trouble and what he was trying to prove. With Cutter and his broken leg, Chloe decideds to take him home, while Nate and Sully continue on with the hunt. They start making their way to Yemen where they will find the next clue to Iram of the Pillars.</p><p>Sully and Nate then meet up with Elena Fisher, where they search the old part of the city, through a tower where they head underground with sawed off shotguns. The three were about to use the constellations to find the Iram of the Pillars, when they are attacked by another swarm of spiders, who seem to tolerate the light more than the ones in France. They make it out alive, and as soon as they leave the tower, Nate is drugged by a dart, the same way Cutter was by Talbot. Sully tries to comfort Nate but Nate resorts to an aggressive form and runs away, where he hears in his head, Talbot telling him not to trust Sully. After knocking him Nate out, Ramese tells Nate that he has Sully hostage in his crew ship. When Nate reaches the lower quarters of the ship, he finds a decoy of Sully, ulimately falling for Ramese trap.</p><p>Sully is next seen being held in a convoy lead by Marlow's men. He kicks the lead driver out of the car he is driving, when he attempts to shoot Nate. Eventually, he is saved by Salim and joins Nate and the group in trying to find the Atlantis of the Sands. When they ride into the desert, a sand storm hits them, and then Sully and Nate are separated from Salim and his men. They attempt to find the city on their own, and then find a temple, which leads into the Iram of the Pillars. Nate and Sully find a foundation of water that supplies the whole temple with water. Nate drinks some of it, and Sully uses some to wash his face. Several seconds later, Sully is shot in the back by Talbot and Marlow, and then dies with Nate slowly letting his body down, griefing for him. Nate then angered runs after the two, trying to kill them.</p><p>As Nate progresses through the temple, he hears Sully's voice and halloucinates, seeing Sully several times. He makes it to a room where he sees Sully, holding him at gunpoint, asking him if he is real. Sully takes his gun, and flicks him in the face, telling him never hold a gun to him again. Sully explains how when he drank the water, it made him halloucinate and go crazy, and then Nate realizes that seeing Sully die was a side-effect of the water, and that is why Talbot and Marlow wanted the ram, to control their enemies with fear. Sully picks up a grenade launcher along their way from a supply drop that find that belong to Marlow's men. The two encounter Talbot and Marlow, seeing them lefting up the ram. The two split up trying to flank them, but Talbot sees Nate and attempts to shoot him but Sully pushes his hand making him miss. Talbot then knocks Sully out, and then pushes him into the water. Nate dives in trying to save Sully, and then takes his grenade launcher and shooting the chain to which the ram was being lifted with. Nate then fires two more rounds into a structure behind Marlow, making the whole temple crumble. As Nate and Sully get out of the water, they attempt to make it out of the city, and then run into Talbot and Marlow again. As soon as Marlow and Talbot were about to shoot Nate and Sully, the room started to crumble and then the floor fell through, along with Nate, Marlow, and Talbot. Talbot and Nate managed to get to higher ground, but Marlow was caught in quicksand, and was sinking fast. She asks for Nate's help, while Sully discourages him to. Nate ulitimately makes a decision to save her, until it was too late, and she was in too deep. Marlow then died like that in the quicksand, along with Drake's ring. Talbot was left furious and went after the two. When Nate and Sully get to higher ground, Talbot sneaks up on them and pushes Nate and himself off a cliff onto short platform, where Talbot and Nate get into a knife fight. Talbot eventually gains the advantage and tries to stab Nate to death, but then Sully assists Nate by shooting Talbot in the arm. As soon as Sully was about to finish him off, the platform started shaking and Sully lost his grip on the gun and it fell out and Nate started to fall to. Nate caught onto a ledge before he could fall any further, and caught the gun. Sully was left on the platform fighting Talbot. As Nate climbed closer to them, Talbot was beating down Sully, and was about to finish him off with a boulder, but is then shot by Nate in the chest and then slowly falls off the cliff and dies. Sully and Nate run into Salim with two other horses and left the crumbling city just before it sinks back into the sands. Sully had mananged to get a few coins from the city while he was there and explained to Nate that it was \"enough\".</p><p>As the two are about to board a plane home, Sully talks to Nate about how he had a lousy beginning in life, with a lousy father, and that he never wanted kids, let alone being able to raise one, and that Nate was almost like a son to him. He gives Nate an engagement ring that he had kept for a while. Sully told Nate and Elena that he bought a similar plane to one he had in the first game. The three then walk to the plane and go home.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>Chloe Frazer was created by <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/naughty-dog-inc/65-827/\">Naughty Dog, Inc</a>, first appearing in 2009's Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, the second game in their <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/uncharted/62-957/\">Uncharted</a> video game series. Her first comic appearance is in the Uncharted mini series written by <a href=\"../../joshua-williamson/26-56513/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joshua Williamson</a>, published by DC Comics.</p><h3> <b>History</b> <b><a href=\"/index.php?title=Chloe_Frazer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1/\"></a></b></h3><p>Little is known about Chloe's history. She and Nate were in a relationship in the past, but Nate walked out on her for unknown reasons. Despite this, both of them still have strong feelings for each other. Chloe dated Flynn for a while, and they tracked Nate down to ask his assistance in a job they were planning. She also seems to have a possible relationship with Cutter, unknown on how they ended up with Nate and his plan to find the lost city.</p><h3> <b>Biography</b> <b><a href=\"/index.php?title=Chloe_Frazer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2/\"></a></b></h3><p>An Australian native, Chloe Frazer is as tough and capable as she is beautiful. She's known throughout Drake's world as a gifted and adaptable treasure hunter with a long list of impressive accomplishments to her name. Equally comfortable in a gunfight or a fistfight - whatever the occasion demands - she's in hot demand for jobs that lesser fortune hunters would turn down flat.</p><p>Although Flynn doesn't realize it, Nate and Chloe go way back, well before Nate's previous adventure, and Nate is surprised - and a bit delighted - to see her when they're re-introduced to one another. Witty and practical, she makes a great addition to any team, although her moral compass has a tendency to spin and her reckless nature can sometimes make her unpredictable.</p><p>Chloe obviously values her friends - but she also has a strong sense of self-preservation and self interest. It's not always clear to those around her which side of her character will win out when push comes to shove...</p><h3> <b><i>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</i></b> </h3><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-80433\" href=\"/nathan-drake/4005-80433/\" slug=\"nathan-drake\">Nathan Drake</a> is taking time out at a bar when he his approached by Chloe and Harry Flynn who ask him to assist them in stealing a Mongolian oil lamp from an Istanbul museum that may hold the answer to the location of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19192\" href=\"/marco-polo/4005-19192/\" slug=\"marco-polo\">Marco Polo</a>'s Lost Fleet. Before they leave, Chloe finds Nate taking a rest in his hotel room, and having dated years ago, they argue about him walking out on her. However, they reconcile and decide to go through with the job as planned, but then run away together after taking their cut of the profits.</p><p>Flynn and Nate acquire the lamp, which contains a map showing that the Lost Fleet had been transporting the Cintamani Stone from Shambhala, before being thrown ashore on Borneo by a tsunami. Taking the map, Flynn betrays Nate by shooting the museum's display cases, alerting the guards. Nate is arrested and imprisoned for three months before <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80434\" href=\"/victor-sullivan/4005-80434/\" slug=\"victor-sullivan\">Victor Sullivan</a> and Chloe secure his release.</p><p>Flynn brings the information to the Serbian war criminal Zoran Lazarevic. They work together to try and find the Cintamani Stone which supposedly grants immortality to the one who controls it. They, along with Chloe (who is acting as a double agent, secretly helping Nate), travel to Borneo in search of the Lost Fleet. Chloe assists Nate and Sullivan in their search for the Cintamani Stone by setting up a distraction along the edge of Lazarevic's camp with C4 charges.</p><p>Eventually, the trio find a tomb containing the bodies of Polo's shipmates, as well as a golden Tibetan Phurba and a map that has a message on it from Polo, pointing towards a specific temple in Nepal. They also learn that the Lost Fleet never took the Cintamani Stone from Shambhala, and deduce that Lazarevic is in fact trying to pick up Polo's exact trail back to Shambala.</p><p>As they leave the tomb, Chloe \"betrays\" them as Flynn and Lazarevic's men show up. Chloe takes the map from them and gives it to Flynn. Flynn learns of the temple in Nepal and tells Chloe and two soldiers to take Nate and Sullivan back to Lazarevic to be killed. However, Chloe shoots the two soldiers and tells Nate to go to Nepal, where she will meet him. Rather than go to Nepal, Sullivan decides to take a vacation.</p><p>In Nepal, Chloe assists Nate in finding the hidden temple. Along the way, they encounter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80435\" href=\"/elena-fisher/4005-80435/\" slug=\"elena-fisher\">Elena Fisher</a> and Jeff, Fisher's cameraman. Elena is in Nepal reporting on the crimes of Lazarevic, who has turned the city into a warzone searching for the Cintamani Stone. When they find the temple, Chloe and Nate complete a series of puzzles to learn that the Cintamani Stone and Shambhala are in the Himalayas. As they exit the temple, Lazarevic's men ambush them, and Jeff is wounded. Nate insists on escaping Nepal with Elena and the injured Jeff, despite Chloe's strong disapproval.</p><p>The group eventually reaches a dead end. Hearing more soldiers coming up behind them, Chloe once again betrays the group, holding them at gunpoint when Flynn and the mercenaries show up in the room and Flynn orders her to be taken to a train. Jeff is executed by Lazarevic, and after failing to bargain with him, Nate and Elena make an escape.</p><p>Nate and Elena are separated when he boards Lazarevic's train in an effort to rescue Chloe. After fighting through several waves of Lazarevic's mercenaries and Lieutenant Draza, Nate finally catches up with Chloe. However, she refuses to leave with him, stating that she didn't want to be rescued in the first place. They argue, but Flynn shoots him in the abdomen. Chloe manages to stop Flynn from killing Nate long enough for him to retreat into another car. As he collapses, he shoots a gas canister in an effort to kill the soldiers advancing towards him, but in doing so, derails the train, which is left hanging over a cliff.</p><p>Chloe doesn't see Nate again until much later. Having survived the train crash, Nate, with Elena's help, trails Lazarevic through the Himalayas to reacquire the Phurba dagger. He finds Chloe, Flynn and Lazarevic in the room believed to hold the key to Shambala. Lazarevic is angry that Flynn has been no help thus far. When Chloe is alone, Nates takes the dagger from her, before finally opening the gate to Shambala.</p><p>Nate leaves Elena in the care of Chloe when he goes to kill Lazarevic, and tells Chloe to escape Shambhala immediately. After defeating Lazarevic, Nathan saves Chloe from a Guardian, and the three of them quickly evacuate the city as it begins to crumble. They return to a nearby Tibetan Village, and Chole decides that it's her turn to walk away, realizing that Nate has fallen for Elena. Sully promptly chases after her.</p><h3> <b>Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception</b> <b><a href=\"/index.php?title=Chloe_Frazer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4/\"></a></b></h3><p>Not much is known about how Chloe got to meet up with Nate in London, but it seems that they have long planned an attempt to rather track the trails of antagonist Katherine Marlowe in order to get the cipher disk to unlock the mystery of Sir Francis Drake and the fabled \"Atlantis of the Sands\".</p><p>After Nate studied the map he took from the secret library and T.E. Lawrence's notes, he instructs Chloe and Cutter to investigate in the castle in Syria while he and Sully will check out the chateau in France, but things did not go well as expected as both of them got ambushed by Talbot. They headed for Syria the next night and found them safe in the castle and continued with the search while encountering Talbot's men. When the group found the clues to find Iram, they made a hasty escape from the castle and stole a bus. While in the bus, Chloe believed that it was not worth finding the lost city due to all the troubles they have experienced, notably Cutter breaking his leg. As a result, she and Cutter left the group, which as of now, their status is still unknown.</p><h3> <b>Personality</b> <b><a href=\"/index.php?title=Chloe_Frazer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5/\"></a></b></h3><p>Chloe is physically attractive and has a dry sense of humor. Chloe has a rather complicated personality. She values her friends but will be quick to sell them out, and thinks of her well being above all else. She is quick to take action and stays positive in dangerous situations. Chloe appears to be the type to walk away from a fight when she's in over her head. We see this when Nate and Elena decide to pursue Zoran Lazarevic, Chloe decides it's better to let Zoran attempt to find the Cintamani stone and retreat while they still can, though she ultimately decides to help. This is also seen when she backs out from the group of Nate in finding of the lost city of <a data-ref-id=\"Ubar\" href=\"/wiki/Ubar/\" slug=\"wiki\">Ubar</a> after witnessing Cutter break his leg.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Voltaic's origins are not explored much beyond having been a Gotham based criminal and a soldier of fortune before his capture by Black Spider, but he appears to have simply been a Metahuman who chose to use his talents for personal gain.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Voltaic was created by <a href=\"/suicide-squad/4050-42803/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42803\">Suicide Squad</a> writer <a href=\"/adam-glass/4040-57519/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-57519\">Adam Glass</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Voltaic was a standard meta criminal from Gotham. During Amanda Waller's torture he proved he was resilient enough to keep silent and remain loyal to his team. His loyalty results in his own death at the hands of the team leader Deadshot.</p><h2><span>Major Story Arcs</span></h2><p>Voltaic was a Gotham criminal imprisoned by fellow Suicide Squad member <a href=\"/black-spider/4005-5812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5812\">Black Spider</a>, who had a tenure as a superhero and was apparently arrested wrongly, whom he understandably held a grudge against. Voltaic was among those tough enough to endure Amanda Waller's torturous \"test of loyalty,\" where he and his teammates were tricked into believing they'd be captured by enemy forces and were pumped for information to see if they'd break under pressure and give away the Suicide Squad's secrets. Having past the test, he and his team were air dropped into a packed stadium under orders to kill everyone inside. The stadium's occupants had been infected by a techno-organic virus that turns people into cannibalistic cyborg \"zombies,\" hence the kill order.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2038370\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2038370-ssquad_22.jpeg\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.7826086956522\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:178.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2038370-ssquad_22.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2038370\"><img alt=\"Voltaic on with the Suicide Squad on their first true mission.\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2038370-ssquad_22.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66303/2038370-ssquad_22.jpeg 690w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66303/2038370-ssquad_22.jpeg 538w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" data-width=\"538\"></a><figcaption>Voltaic on with the Suicide Squad on their first true mission.</figcaption></figure><p>Voltaic's powers gave him a huge advantage over the infected since their partially metallic components made them excellent conductors for his electrical attacks. When Deadshot ordered the Squad to divide up into two teams to cover more ground, he picked Voltaic to accompany him and King Shark. Deadshot was quite impressed by Voltaic's powers more than once, and Voltaic in turn followed Deadshot's orders obediently during the mission, even referring to him as boss. He told Voltaic to zap everything and to take no chances, as any of the infected could eventually pose a threat and there was no effective way to discern whether or not they were truly dead.</p><p>After the team had found their target, they fought the woman who had also been infected. After some conflict, the infected woman was killed and Deadshot realizes that the package which the woman was carrying was in fact the baby in her womb. The baby is important because it is truly immune to the infection. After displaying extreme loyalty to the unofficial leader of the makeshift team, Voltaic is killed by the man he had proven his loyalty to, because Deadshot received orders from Amanda Waller so that Voltaic could be used as a scapegoat and be blame for the incident that happened within the stadium.</p><p>After Death, Black Spider and El Diablo discovered that Voltaic had been blamed for all of the deaths. El Diablo realized what Deadshot did. Diablo eventually confronted Deadshot after Black Spider had been shot to try to convince Deadshot to help move Spider. It didn't work but Harley Quinn helped get Black Spider out of to the evac.</p><p>After the ordeal of being killed, battling Regulus, dealing with Death of The Family, and being reborn, Deadshot is being escorted with Harley Quinn to their next mission, and are surprised to see Yo-Yo, King Shark and Voltaic waiting for him. Deadshot expresses his disbelief, claiming he specifically shot Voltaic dead in the face, watching his brains splatter. Voltaic never says anything. The Team attacks the Triads and Red Orchid's Elite Guards. As the rest of the Team fights, Yo-Yo helps Voltaic. Voltaic is suddenly impaled directly through the heart. Yo-Yo is about to tell Waller when Voltaic incinerates the guard with a massive Lightning blast, then simply removes the sword. Later, as Red Orchid attacks, Voltaic fires lightning, only to have his head eaten by a venus flytrap. However, he is seen completely unharmed afterwards.</p><p>After the battle with Red Orchid and her Triad, Voltaic joins Deadshot, Harley, King Shark and Waller through the sewers in a desperate attempt to rescue <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kurt-lance/4005-83647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83647\">Kurt Lance</a>. Not long after, The Team is attacked by a sewer monster who blames Waller for his transformation. Waller is out cold, as Voltaic creates an electric bubble, keeping everyone afloat in the tidal wave of swamp water. The swamp monster manages to break into the bubble, and fills Voltaic with poisonous water, only to be electrocuted in his own water.</p><p>Voltaic is then recovering with the group when Deadshot decides to abandon Waller and her mission while she's out cold. The rest of the Team disagrees, saying they gave Waller their word they'd help. Deadshot can't believe what he's hearing and asks if their kidding. Unknown Soldier then appears, tells Deadshot a man's word always matters, and shoots him in the chest.</p><p>Voltaic is later seen back in the prison, taunting Unknown Soldier while the play Scrabble as Harley looks on, and Deadshot recovers in Intensive Care. Waller gives signal to Soldier while Voltaic taunts him about his past wars and if he killed kids. Unknown Soldier then rips a piece of the table and violently beats Voltaic to death.</p><p>Later, Voltaic is seen in Intensive Carre, being given a special serum that brings people back to life. The serum doesn't seem to work, and Voltaic's corpse begins to contract while electricity fills the room.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h4>Electricity Generation and Control</h4><p>He possesses the ability to generate powerful volts of electricity easily capable of vaporizing a human body, which came in handy for killing the techno-zombies as well as disposing of their remains. He would usually fire his electrical attacks from his hands, but displayed the ability to channel a more powerful attack through the stadium's bleachers to slay multiple enemies, the only downside to that move being that it leaves him drained for a few hours.</p><p><strong>Immortality</strong></p><p>It is assumed he was not initially immortal, but Waller may have done something to his corpse, bringing him back to life and making him immortal. He is shown being impaled through the heart with a kitana, and having his entire head engulfed by a venus flytrap and surviving, however it is unknown how his head was still intact</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Ambellina is a Prise, one of the three races throughout The Amory Wars universe. Like all Prise, she was created by God to join her sisters in protecting the Keywork.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Ambellina was created by the creator of The Amory Wars, <a data-ref-id=\"4040-45236\" href=\"/claudio-sanchez/4040-45236/\" slug=\"claudio-sanchez\">Claudio Sanchez</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Second Stage Turbine Blade</h3><p>Ambellina was chosen by her sisters to be The Watcher; the one that would guide The Crowing, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-73994\" href=\"/claudio-kilgannon/4005-73994/\" slug=\"claudio-kilgannon\">Claudio Kilgannon</a>. She had her wings burned and was sent to the Kilgannons' house to find Claudio. However, she only found Newo Ikkin, Claudio's girlfriend. Ambellina followed Newo back to her house, where she was attacked by one of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45725\" href=\"/wilhelm-ryan/4005-45725/\" slug=\"wilhelm-ryan\">Wilhelm Ryan</a>'s Onstantine Priests that is also searching for The Crowing. Ambellina comes forward to protect Newo from the Priest's assault, but she is overpowered. Newo sneaks up on the Priest and smashes a glass bottle on it, giving Ambellina enough time to finish the distracted mutant.</p><p>Ambellina then reads the letter that Claudio left for Newo. After reading it, Ambellina realizes that Newo is of no use to her. She lies to Newo, telling her that the letter is correct and Claudio is dead, and that she should continue with her normal life.</p><h3>In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</h3><p>Ambellina has found Claudio by this time, and is following and watching him from the shadows. She sees him use his powers for the first time since he departed from Cecil and the camp. Then, in Issue 2, Ambellina is seen in a crowd watching Claudio after he experiences one of his frequent visions of his father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45235\" href=\"/coheed-kilgannon/4005-45235/\" slug=\"coheed-kilgannon\">Coheed Kilgannon</a>. Later, as an Onstantine Priest is about to make its move and attack Claudio, Ambellina saves him by pulling the monster up to her and the rooftop and battling it up there. However, the Priest overwhelms her and throws her from the roof through a window moments after Claudio passes by it. The monster in then seen dashing for the club that Claudio has entered, but Ambellina cuts it off with a jump kick.</p><p>As Claudio is then moving through the sewer-like streets of Godder Damm that night and sees his father again, the Priest makes another assault on the Crowing's life. Ambellina apprehends it again, and this time finally slays the beast. Claudio then begins to follow his savior and question her. She informs him that she has been following him for ten years, four months, and three days and has been sent to protect and guide him. This irks Claudio, as he been in denial over his destiny as The Crowing, and the two begin to argue. As they're quarreling, they pause to see the execution of Wilhelm Ryan being displayed on a public screen.</p><p>The two then go to where Claudio lives, and Ambellina is less than satisfied with it. Again, the two begin to argue, and Claudio storms off after hearing a noise. Ambellina reluctantly follows. As the pair is walking through the sewers again, they stumble upon a mutilated body in a garbage dump. Ambellina informs him that the dead body is an IRO-bot, and a sign of Claudio's destiny. He becomes angered again, and uses his powers to turn immaterial. He shifts back to material form while his arm is still projected through Ambellina's chest. Phasing again and pulling it out, Claudio watches Ambellina fall to the ground. Coheed appears again and tells Claudio he just killed the one being in the universe who was watching out for him. Claudio becomes upset and angered over what he has done. He falls to his knees and grabs her, screaming her name \"Lina.\" His hands begin to emit a greenish light as he clutches her, and she soon awakes to rudely tell him to never call her by that name again. Ambellina then gives Claudio the final choice to embrace his powers and follow his destiny, or to continue to run from it. Claudio accepts, under the one condition that he can call her \"Bell\".</p><h3>Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Vol 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness</h3><p>Aboard the Grail Arbor, Ambellina watches over Claudio as he dreams. The ship lands on Kalline, a neighboring planet of Apity Prime, where Wilhelm Ryan is hiding out. Their ship is ambushed by the Red Army, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74000\" href=\"/jesse-kilgannon/4005-74000/\" slug=\"jesse-kilgannon\">Jesse</a> commands Ambellina to take Claudio to safety and hide.</p><p>Outside of The Fiction, the weight of the Writer's personal problems is growing too heavy. Advised by the Ten Speed, he reluctantly decides to kill off Ambellina as a way to deal with his own suffering. He enters The Fiction through the Willing Well, and confronts Claudio and Ambellina.</p><p>An Onstantine Priest is attacking Ambellina as the Writer appears through the Willing Well. Claudio is attacking the Priest to rescue Ambellina, but the Writer tells him to stop. The Writer reveals the truth of The Fiction to Claudio, and that Ambellina is just a representation of his lost love. Before Claudio reacts, the Writer pierces Ambellina through the chest and kills her. Claudio rushes to her side, but there is nothing he can do. She leaves Claudio with her final words: \"Dear Claudio, I know not much of love... It's not in my make. But if I could've, I would have loved you.\"</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>The son of an American mother and a German father, Will von Hammer was born in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\" href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\" slug=\"germany\">Germany</a> and raised in the city of Bonn. His mother was a member of the American military, and the daughter of the American hero <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76773\" href=\"/stormy-foster/4005-76773/\" slug=\"stormy-foster\">Stormy Foster</a>. Little else is known about his early life or family. At some point he took up work as a private investigator in his native Bonn.   <br/><h2>Creation</h2>Will von Hammer was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42389\" href=\"/james-robinson/4040-42389/\" slug=\"james-robinson\">James Robinson</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-43012\" href=\"/renato-guedes/4040-43012/\" slug=\"renato-guedes\">Renato Guedes</a>.   <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Tourist  </h3>von Hammer encounters <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21508\" href=\"/mon-el/4005-21508/\" slug=\"mon-el\">Mon-El</a>, who is travelling the world, in Germany. The pair become embroiled in a case involving the will of  a recently deceased millionaire albino dwarf. After von Hammer aids the hero in resolving the case, they part ways. <br/><h3>The Shade </h3>von Hammer is hired by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81901\" href=\"/darnell-caldecott/4005-81901/\" slug=\"darnell-caldecott\">Darnell Caldecott</a>, one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9362\" href=\"/shade/4005-9362/\" slug=\"shade\">Shade's</a> descendants, to locate a sample of Shade's blood. He is unsuccessful, but quickly uncovers a conspiracy within the Caldecott organization which is attempting to have Shade killed. He passes on a warning to Shade, and soon finds himself under attack himself. He manages to escape numerous attempts on his life, culminating in an assault at the hands of the shadowy gangster <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76187\" href=\"/bete-noire/4005-76187/\" slug=\"bete-noire\">Bete-Noire</a>, whose attack is stopped by the intervention of the Shade. He is retained as a private investigator by Shade, who tasks him with travelling to England and uncovering further information about the Caldecotts<br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>von Hammer inherited enhanced strength and superhuman durability from his grandfather. He is a gifted armed and unarmed fighter, skilled marksman, and a competent gymnast. He is of average or above average intelligence, an expert investigator, and fluent in at least German and English.  ",

During the race Maddy was the voice in Cliff's ear, and she was the first to notice that something was wrong. After the accident Maddy would blame herself, believing her calculations were off and she didn't account for the heat friction the tires would cause, and thats what almost killed Cliff.</p><p>Cliff wouldn't die but he became Robotman and when Maddy learned he was alive she quit U.N.R.E.A.S.O.N. and spent all her time and energy taking care of Robotman, and his special kind of life.

Robotman meets her there, but when they are attacked by a 50ft gecko, Maddy escapes to a bunker. That's where Robotman finds her and Dr. Turing.</p><p>Dr. Turing reveals to Maddy and Robotman, that it was him that caused Cliff' car to explode. He had cause the accident to see if the Nano-bot would in fact do everything to save Cliff's life. Cliff tries to kill the doctor but when he can't Maddy points out she has already called <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58897\" href=\"/unreason/4060-58897/\" slug=\"unreason\">U.N.R.E.A.S.O.N.</a> to come and get the doctor.</p><p>Once back at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57594\" href=\"/uncanny-valley/4020-57594/\" slug=\"uncanny-valley\">Uncanny Valley</a> Maddy lies to Mrs Turing, saying they never found Dr. Turing.

Alastor pleaded with Psion scientists to create a plague that would infect any human within a certain radius. The Psions designed a pathogen that would cause a merger between alien and human DNA. Alastor was stopped by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\" href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" slug=\"legion-of-super-heroes\">  Legion</a> but certain individuals like Dr. Scanlon were compromised.</p><p>Dr. Scanlon became an energy being whose genetic code was now similar to that of a Teallian. At first, Scanlon feels isolated but at as time goes by, Scanlon begins to accept his newfound powers. The Legion member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3621\" href=\"/wildfire/4005-3621/\" slug=\"wildfire\"> Wildfire</a> became aware of Scanlon's genetic alteration when he notices an unusual energy signature that was dispersed nearby. The Legion confront the doctor and ask him to come into their custody in order to help him expel Alastor's pathogen from his body. Scanlon doesn't quite trust the Legion so he lashes out at them. Wildfire pities the good doctor and tries to consult him. Unfortunately, Scanlon disregards his former humanity and decides to self implode himself. Scanlon is Alastor's first of many victims that are yet to come.</p>",

However, when the Signal Men's creators died, they lay dormant for many years and eventually Peraxxus found them. He used the Signal Men to destroy different worlds and collect anything of value: Ore, minerals, seeds, spores, germs and anything else which may hold some price. </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Peraxxus was created by <a href=\"/justice-league-international/4050-42590/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42590\">Justice League International</a> writer <a href=\"/dan-jurgens/4040-4321/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4321\">Dan Jurgens</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Signal Masters</h3><p>The Signal Men alert Peraxxus of Earth and he uses them to cause chaos across the planet. When <a href=\"/guy-gardner/4005-1791/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\">Guy Gardner</a> hears that there is a spacecraft in orbit he goes to investigate, thinking it  might have something to do with the large robots destroying the World. He is indeed correct. However before he can do much, Peraxxus knocks him out. Peraxxus then teleports Guy, along with the <a href=\"/justice-league-international/4060-26208/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26208\">Justice League International</a> (who have been defeated and captures by Perxxus's drones) to one location, where he reveals his plan. The JLI break free, but Peraxxus retreats back to his ship and watches as the Signal Men destroy the planet. He's eventually defeated when the JLI distract him, while altering the ships programming. The Signal Men cease to function and Peraxxus flies off into space, swearing he will get revenge.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Peraxxus is shown having many powers including flight, super strength and high levels of durability. He is also able to teleport and fire blasts of energy from his axe.  </p>",
