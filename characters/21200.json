    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Fang Zhifu was the leader of a special combat unit known as a Xeno-Team for the Chinese government. The Xeno-Teams responsibilities were to respond to alien attacks. When a spaceship crashed in Qinghai Province, Fang and his team were sent to attack and capture one of the aliens. The aliens were known as the Durlans and after their living ship had been shot down they used a biological attack, by shifting themselves into an alien Bacteria. Fang successfully defeated the aliens with the loss of most of his team and catching the disease.</p><p>The Chinese were able to provide an experimental treatment for Fang, but the side effects were good and bad. His strength had been greatly increased but his skin began growing rusty plates of iron. His fiance broke off their engagement, but the Chinese government was very interested in his new abilities. With the technology that was reverse engineered from the Durlan space craft, three other members of the Great Ten were created and a new Chinese super team was formed.</p><p>August Iron General appeared in the first seven weeks of the <a href=\"/52/4050-18053/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18053\">52</a> series. He leads the <a href=\"/great-ten/4060-41201/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41201\">Great Ten</a>. China then joins <a href=\"/black-adam/4005-4916/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4916\">Black Adam</a>'s coalition and send him to the talks with Russia's <a href=\"/rocket-red/4005-2385/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2385\">Rocket Red</a>. When black Adam goes crazy the Great Ten try to stop him but August must authorize the US heroes coming into China to fight.</p><p><a href=\"/checkmate/4060-40521/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40521\">Checkmate</a> went to China to find out who was spying there for <a href=\"/kobra/4005-3607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3607\">Kobra</a>. The Great Ten intervened and subsequently there was a fight between the two teams before the Prime Minister and <a href=\"/alan-scott/4005-12663/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12663\">Alan Scott</a> intervened and found out who was the traitor. This made China change it's veto on Checkmate.</p><p>August Iron General became a Bishop, for the government organisation known as <a href=\"/checkmate/4060-40521/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40521\">Checkmate</a> though this is presumed that he is there only to spy for the Chinese Government is has been revealed that he has a lover in <a href=\"/ghost-fox-killer/4005-41237/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41237\">Ghost Fox Killer</a>, a fellow hero in the Great Ten. Their relationship developed when they first met, Ghost Fox Killer being unable to touch others, August General was unaffected by her touch. Because of his appearance, no normal woman would ever want to touch him, so together they both found something special.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Chimera</h3><p><b>For more information see: <a href=\"/checkmate-chimera/4050-42133/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42133\">Checkmate: Chimera</a></b></p><p>August General acting as the Black King's Bishop is in Checkmate Castle monitoring three large beast who appear all over the globe. When August learns one beast is in China he asks Taleb Beni Khalid to go and stop it but he is denied.</p><h3>The Signal Masters</h3><p><b>For more information see: <a href=\"/the-signal-masters/4045-56915/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56915\">The Signal Masters</a></b></p><p><a href=\"/andre-briggs/4005-79822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79822\">Andre Briggs</a> has put together a new Justice League, this one having representatives from around the world and beholden to the UN. August Iron General acts as the Chinese representation. He and <a href=\"/rocket-red/4005-2385/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2385\">Rocket Red</a> butt heads right away but <a href=\"/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\">Booster Gold</a>, the team leader convinces them both to get along for the sake of the team.</p><p>The Teams first mission is to go to Peru to locate several missing UN personnel, there they are attacked by a giant robot. August and Rocket Red take turn saving each others lives, but when <a href=\"/ice/4005-2051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2051\">Ice</a> is badly wounded Booster orders a retreat. This doesn't sit well with some of the team but August along with <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> and <a href=\"/godiva/4005-10076/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10076\">Godiva</a> come to Booster's side.</p><p>Then, when 3 more giant robots show up, Booster splits the teams of two. August and Godiva go to Canada, where they find an underground cavern under the robot there but while searching cavern they are over run by mud-men. They are capture then teleported to Peru where they find Booster and the rest of the team. There they meet and battle <a href=\"/peraxxus/4005-80488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80488\">Peraxxus</a> the man behind the giant robots. They are over powered and Peraxxus leaves them to die.</p><p>The team surrives and sneaks aboard Peraxxus's ship. Booster breaks the team into two groups, August is in the group that goes for Peraxxus, while Batman, Rocket Red and Ice take over the ship controls. August is able to hit Peraxxus but it isn't until Godiva takes away Peraxxus's staff that the team is victorious. Peraxxus escapes again but this time the team crashes his ship into one of the giant robots shutting them all down.</p><p>Later, while some of the team is cleaning up the wreckage of Peraxxus's ship August and Godiva go out for a hotdog. August tries to explain to Godiva that he is proud of her, even though she thinks she is in over her head. While August is explaining that the metal around his body is now his skin, <a href=\"/breakdown/4005-83316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83316\">Breakdown</a> tries to blow up the UN but August stops him and Godiva defuses the bomb.</p><p>This prompts August to interrupt Booster while he is giving his presentation to the UN counsel. August begs Council Women Boa, the Chinese councilwomen to keep the group together. She agrees and the team is reintroduced to the public but terrorist attack and blow a bomb under the team's stage.</p><h2>Powers and Weapons</h2><p>His skin is an armored \"biometal\" and he uses an energy staff which can fire blasts or streams of energy. The iron plating that is his skin is extremely durable and gives the General super strength.</p><p>The Bio-metallic plates are actually the Generals Skin. His genetic code was altered sufficiently by the Durlan shape-shifters shifting their forms into an infectious bacterial load, that ultimately changed the physical forms of a number of Fang's team. His powers are based on his altered physical form.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Xu Tao grew up in Tai'an, China. He and his family sold souvenirs to sightseers from a booth in town. When his father refused to bribe the local police, they lost their booth and their home. Xu had to join a street gang simply to survive but was not cut out for the job and was arrested. Once released, the gang was sent after him to make an example of him. <br/> <br/>On the run, Xu fell into a tree where he heard a voice asking for help. It was the Celestial Bow of Yi, a Chinese hero, who had came to the Earth and eventually died of old age over four thousand years ago. Xu took the bow and defended himself from his attackers. The bow gave Yu the instincts of a great archer and the bow had amazing powers. <br/> <br/>He was compelled to fire an arrow toward the Moon and once there met with Xiang-O, the Moon Maiden. She was the wife of Yi. She took him to the home of the gods, where they bestowed him with the title of Celestial Archer in order to inspire his countrymen and prepare the world for their return. <br/> <br/>Instead of doing what he was supposed to, he ended up joing the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41201\" href=\"/great-ten/4060-41201/\" slug=\"great-ten\"> Great Ten</a> and fighting for the government, forgetting his purpose and vow to the gods.</p>",

Hong Kong is also the most haunted in the world from the sheer amounts of ghosts she creates. The ghost can be controlled by her, but cannot be used to harm for her. If the ghosts are destroyed, part of her society is destroyed as well. She often keeps tabs on criminals and gangsters by using other criminals for information. In exchange for this information, she allows them to keep their lives.</p><p> </p><p>On Earth, she has developed a relationship with <a href=\"/august-general-in-iron/4005-41235/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41235\"> August General in Iron</a>. This bond is special as no woman would wish to be with the General and no other mortal is capable of surviving Ghost Fox Killers touch. She is currently a member of the <a href=\"/great-ten/4060-41201/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41201\"> Great Ten</a>, a Chinese super team.</p><h3>Powers and Abilities</h3><p>The mere touch of Ghost Fox Killer will kill a man where he stands, she also has many ghostly abilities such as being able to pass through walls, being extremely hard to kill, and can in the astral realm.</p><p>Anyone killed by her can not pass into death. Instead, their spirit is bound into her service to maintains the stability of her realm. They also act as her spies and servants, although they can not act without being in her presence. One ghost acts as her personal chauffeur, driving her around in a ghostly 1920s limo. She also carries some type of jade pistols that can kill and collect more souls for her as well as the use of jade lions which follow her commands.</p>",

Although they are a squad, only one can be the Immortal Man in Darkness at a time. They fly a living ship known as the Dragonwing, which was reverse engineered from a crashed alien spaceship. Once suited up, the Immortal Man in Darkness enters a capsule of amniotic fluid and becomes one with the ship. But there is a price for this: every flight takes one year off of the pilot's life. Once a pilot finally dies, the next one in line in the squad takes his place.</p><p> </p><p>It is considered a great honor to be the Immortal Man in Darkness.</p><p> </p><h3>Known Pilots</h3><p><b>Chen Nuo</b> - The current Immortal Man in Darkness. Graduated top of his class from flight school and special ops. Having extreme skill behind the stick and devotion to duty, Chen was selected to become part of the squadron. Even after seeing the death of the current pilot because of the flights did not deter him from becoming what he long idolized. As the Immortal Man in Darkness he is a member of the <a href=\"/great-ten/4060-41201/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41201\"> Great Ten</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers</h2><p><b>Immortal Man in Darkness</b></p><p>The Immortal Man in Darkness' powersuit is actually a living Durlan spacecraft bonded to him.</p><p> </p><p><b>Dragonwing </b></p><p>There is almost nothing the Dragonwing cannot accomplish. It is able to exceed speeds of mach 10 in less than three seconds, stop immediately, hover, manuever and fly sideways. The Dragonwing is also equipped with over fifty different weapons packages which include energy blasts.</p><p>It also can form tentacles and blades, making controlling the jet seem like controlling living shadows.</p><p> </p><p>There are also at least nine other ships of the Dragonwing that can be controlled from the Dragonwing itself in extreme conditions.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Wu Mei-Xing was once a theoretical physicist doing research on the Higgs Boson, a theoretical particle that would help determine the origin of mass in the universe. One day while working near the particle accelerator there was a containment breach and she was exposed to the particles inside. This caused her to be unable to birth children and because of this her husband left her.  <br /> <br />At first she simply focused on work but the reality of no man wanting a barren woman soon took it's toll. She turned to alcohol and often wished for death. Three days after an encounter with stranger she found herself as pregnant as a normal woman would be at the end of her cycle and went into labor. She gave birth to twenty five children even though there was no way they should have fit inside her. <br /> <br />The children grew rapidly and by the next day they were about ten years old. The following day they had aged further and gained metahuman abilities. But by the eight day, they were all dead. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-68431\" href=\"/vice-premier-jiang/4005-68431/\"> Director Jiang</a> saw the value in her and her miraculous children and portrayed her as the mother of Chinese heroes. She was happy to do what was necessary for China and would breed with army volunteers or other members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41201\" href=\"/great-ten/4060-41201/\"> Great Ten</a>.  <br /> <br /></p><h3>Powers and Abilities</h3><p>Just as her name implies, she gives birth to a constant stream of super-strong progeny, in litters of twenty-five every three days. She has thousands of these children, even though they are short-lived; the record is twenty-five years. She uses a special walker to get around when she's near-term. </p>The Mother of Champions also has stated she need not eat or breath to survive and has no problems surviving deadly radiation.",

    "description": "<p>Yang Kei-Ying was born over 300 years ago in the Fujian Province of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55795\" href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/4020-55795/\" slug=\"peoples-republic-of-china\">  China</a>. Extremely poor, he joined the army just to be able to eat. He took part in the Emperor's attack on the Shaolin Temple. The army was unable to defeat the five masters of the temple. One of the masters, Bak Mei, turned against his brothers and helped the Emperor defeat the temple. Watching the masters battle made Yang want to become a master himself, but he was mocked and turned away by Bak Mei. <br/> <br/>To learn the martial arts, Yang went to the Wushu school in the mountains inhabited by the Seven Scribes of the Cloudy Satchel, masters equal if not greater than Bak Mei, in hopes of being trained. Yang begged them, claiming that his bad deeds were the cause of hunger and being forced to do them. They saw through his lies and passed judgment on him. He was responsible for his actions and he was given his powers - which were also his curse.  <br/> <br/>Yang had been given seven lifetimes of martial arts skills. This also caused him to have seven different personalities and seven different thought processes, all fighting with one another for control. With this power, he easily defeated Bak Mei. The only thing that all seven minds can agree on is their love for violence, something he has kept hidden, along with his origin. Most believe that he gained his powers from saving an old man who was being assaulted. <br/> <br/>As the Seven Deadly Brothers, Yang joined the Chinese superhero group known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41201\" href=\"/great-ten/4060-41201/\" slug=\"great-ten\"> Great Ten</a>. He still only plays the part of a hero, his true motives being the thrill of fighting and the hopes that one day his torment will all be ended after an unknown amount of lifetimes lived. <br/> <br/></p><h3>Powers &amp; Abilities </h3><br/>As the Seven Deadly Brothers, he is able to duplicate into seven forms, all capable of thinking on their own (as they are all separate personalities). Each of the seven is the master of a particular form of Wushu (or Kung Fu) such as the Crane style and the Tiger style.",

    "description": "<p>The story of the Shaolin Robot begins with <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/4020-55795/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55795\">China's</a> first emperor, Qin Shi Huang. In preparation for the afterlife, he had 8,000 terracotta soldiers built to protect him. He was also assisted by Lao Yuqi, a genius and inventor of the time. He created 100 automated soldiers with the Chinese I-Ching (similar to binary code) to protect him from any grave robbers. </p><p> </p><p>Upon the emperor's death, Lao Yuqi was entombed with him as the Emperor had ordered. Knowing his death would be soon, he reprogrammed one of his creations with his own insights, values and priorities. In modern times, the tomb was discovered and the soldiers awakened. They stormed Beijing as programmed in an attempt to take the Forbidden City back for the Emperor. The army was unable to stop them, but two new super functionaries of the Republic of China - <a href=\"/august-general-in-iron/4005-41235/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41235\">August General in Iron</a> and the <a href=\"/socialist-red-guardsman/4005-41242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41242\">Socialist Red Guardsman</a> - were able to destroy all of them. All of them but the one who stayed in the tomb. </p><p> </p><p>The final automation was taken by <a href=\"/vice-premier-jiang/4005-68431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68431\">Vice Premier Jiang</a> to the Great Wall Complex and revived. After some cosmetic and weaponry enhancements, the Shaolin Robot was unveiled and made a member of the <a href=\"/great-ten/4060-41201/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41201\">Great Ten</a>. Although the robot can only speak in it's I-Ching code, it is capable of transmitting it's thoughts and philosophies to other technology. </p><p> </p><h2> Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Shaolin Robot is a fearless member of the Great Ten, extremely loyal and equipped with high tech weaponry. Shaolin Robot has an energy blaster for a right arm and the other arm produces an energy blade. It can also fly.</p>",

    "description": "<h3>Origin</h3><p>Zou Kang is a history teacher from <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/4020-55795/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55795\"> China</a>. One day on a field trip with his students to a museum, he stumbled across an ancient scroll with dialect never translated. Somehow, Zou unlocked it's meaning and spoke the words aloud: 'All Hail the Jewel in the Lotus'. This unleashed his siddhis, or supernatural Buddhist powers. That day he explored his new powers and saved a ferry boat from trouble, becoming a legend.</p><p> </p><p>The greatest of the Chinese heroes, Thundermind is loved by all and is considered the Chinese <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\"> Superman</a>. Zou even leads a double life and keeps his identity a secret. He also is in love with a woman named <a href=\"/wu-zhang/4005-68430/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68430\"> Wu Zhang</a>, who happens to be in love with Thundermind, not Zou.</p><p> </p><p>As Thundermind, he is a trusted member of the <a href=\"/great-ten/4060-41201/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41201\"> Great Ten</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>By saying the phrase 'All hail the jewel in the lotus, Zou can transform into Thundermind, who is a Bodhisattva, which means he is the closest a human can get to a real Buddha god. The phrase also can help him focus on his telepathy, which he once used to incapacitate Green Lantern.</p><p>As Thundermind, he possesses many powers including flight, invulnerability, super speed, and strength enough to knock the Chinese god of war flying. He has heightened senses, size alternation, telepathy and telekinesis. Thundermind has the power of bilocation, the ability to be in many places at once. He can also turn invisible. Despite his amazing powers, Thundermind is a very humble person.</p>",

His father was a scientist that was enthralled at the implications these beings held for science, biology, technology and our entire conception of how the world and life on it functioned. His father wanted to see if super powers could be induced and Supercharger helped his dad by collecting data, clip articles and help in the lab. A lab accident occurred and his father was killed in an explosion when the generators he was working on could not handle the power he demanded of them. Supercharger ended up with this power and became a human battery with the ability to absorb unimaginable amounts of energy and discharge it at will. Supercharger believed that super beings were freaks and monsters that brought nothing but pain, destruction and suffering. Supercharger was upset that the people embraced these violent freaks and make heroes out of them. He believed the more heroes and freaks out there just brought more pain, death and anguish and had plans to make a major statement through a violent tragedy.   <br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1212584-sup7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1212584\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.81463414634146\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1212584-sup7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1212584\"><img alt=\" Supercharger is a living battery. \" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1212584-sup7.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1212584-sup7.jpg 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" data-width=\"410\"></a><figcaption> Supercharger is a living battery. </figcaption></figure>     Supercharger went to the office of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25215\" href=\"/maxie-shiffman/4005-25215/\">         Maxie Shiffman</a> who was an agent that tried to persuade <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\">        Spider Man </a>to be one of his clients. Shiffman would make Supercharger a client and would book him onto a show called \"It's Amazing\" when he couldn't get Spider Man. However, the web-head agreed to make Shiffman his agent when Parker was having money issues at home and agree to be on the \"It's Amazing\" show. Shiffman introduced Spider Man to Supercharger in his new costume before the show began and the wall-crawler's spider sense started to buzz when the living battery excused himself from the room. The \"It's Amazing\" show started filming in front of a live audience when Supercharger appeared on camera and took down the co-host, Mac Sanders with an electric blast. Supercharger ripped an electric cable in half and let the electricity surge into his body and told the audience how amazing the show will be when he kills them all. Staff members tried to escape but Supercharger welded the doors shut and trapped everyone inside the studio. Spider Man saw the takeover from backstage and tried to use the phone to contact the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\" href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\">     Baxter Building</a> but Supercharger had cut the phone lines. Spider Man broke a window and was planning to reach the Fantastic Four on foot but paused when he heard a woman scream. Supercharger had the female hostage and wanted the world to see a tragedy that super beings can cause with their powers and witness the horror they're tolerating. Supercharger believed that the world would open their eyes if a tragic event caused by a super being took place and hopefully put an end to these monsters. Supercharger was about to deliver the killing blow with his glowing hand but Spider Man swooped in and took the hostage away. Spider Man engaged Supercharger in battle and evaded numerous strikes and blows until his luck ran out. The web-head was hit with an energy blast and crashed onto the floor. Spider Man saw a staff member hiding under a desk and asked him for help against the living battery. Supercharger absorbed enough juice to fry the audience but was taken by surprised when Spider Man wrapped both of his hands with two electric cables. Spider Man told the staff member to hit the switch and Supercharger was overwhelmed by the enormous amount of energy that surged through him and collapsed to his knees. Spider Man saves the entire audience and Supercharger was apprehended by the police.    <br /><h2>Mayor Story Artcs<br /></h2><h3>Masters of Evil</h3>The <a href=\"../../crimson-cowl/29-22613/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                            Crimson  Cowl</a> would bring together twenty-five  super  villains into her <a href=\"../../masters-of-evil/65-7582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                             Masters  of Evil</a> for one orchestrated plan to  rule the  world. Supercharger and  the Masters of Evil would split up in  different  groups and acquire  important components so they could install  numerous  weather modulators  around the world. The world would bow to  their  feet after they  unleashed cataclysmic storms in various countries.  <a href=\"../../clint-barton/29-1475/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                           Hawkeye</a>  and five <a href=\"../../thunderbolts/65-23977/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                           Thunderbolts</a> members discovered their base and devised  a plan  to  take down the Masters. <a href=\"../../moonstone/29-3279/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                         Moonstone</a>  would join the Masters so  she can get inside their  defenses while the  rest of the T-Bolts took  down five foes and wear  their costumes as  disguises. Moonstone revealed to the Cowl that the  T-Bolts  were  disguised as members of the Masters of Evil. Hawkeye and  the  T-Bolts  removed their disguises and all hell broke loose. Supercharger jumped onto <a href=\"../../charcoal/29-19938/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                  Charcoal</a> and hit him with an energy blast. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3284\" href=\"/jolt/4005-3284/\">                 Jolt</a> diverted <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13392\" href=\"/cardinal/4005-13392/\">                Cardinal</a> into Charcoal's path and the Thunderbolt sprung into the air and used Supercharger as a battering ram.<a href=\"../../atlas/29-3277/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"../../songbird/29-3281/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> The energy discharge from Supercharger's collision with Cardinal knocked both villains out.

In order to save his race Rahger, leader of The Black, decided that his people needed to breed with the newer race of waterkin.

Aspen as the only being of her kind is the most powerful of all The Blue and The Black; it is this power that causes others try to manipulate or destroy her, or seek her as a savior.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p><a href=\"/fathom/4050-18057/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18057\">Fathom</a> was created by <a href=\"/michael-turner/4040-3626/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3626\">Michael Turner</a> in 1998 for <a href=\"/characters/&amp;pubId=606&amp;itn=hero/\">Top Cow</a> at Image.

Being a Blue, Aspen lived underwater with the rest of her people. Her parents were leaders of a group that believed that their people should stay underwater and away from humans. There were others who disagreed, but they couldn't do anything about it since Aspen's parents had the love of the people. When Aspen was eleven years old (Year 1988 in the comics), she and her older brother, <a href=\"/finn/4005-41313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41313\">Finn</a>, came home from a late night swim to discover their parents being murdered by a group of dissidents led by <a href=\"/killian/4005-41255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41255\">Killian</a>. They fled, stealing a ship and heading away as fast as possible. Killian's people followed them but their ship exploded and they were presumed dead.</p><p>Aspen's latent powers activated and she survived. Her brother, on the other hand, was hit by a beam and disappeared (It was later revealed that the beam caused his body to become permanently water-based). Aspen somehow wound up on a ship called Paradise. She was found by the crew of the ship who alerted <a href=\"/captain-matthews/4005-46681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46681\">Captain Matthews</a>, who was a passenger on the ship, because their Captain was busy with the other passengers. Aspen had no memory of her previous life, so she was adopted and raised by Captain Matthews. Though she didn't remember what she was, she never forgot her love for the water. Aspen never called Captain Matthews \"dad\" or \"father\", she always referred to him as \" Captain Matthews,\" even though it was too formal, she just became used to it. Captain Matthews was mostly away due to his service to the U.S. Navy. She was an excellent swimmer and even made it to the 1988 Olympics in <a href=\"/south-korea/4020-55932/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55932\">Korea</a> at the age of fifteen. After winning a gold medal and breaking the world record by thirty seconds, the committee forced her to take a drug test. She tested negative for performance enhancing drugs, but an analysis of her blood showed that she induced Erythrocythemia (also known as blood doping), an illegal form of performance enhancing in which a person injects themselves with their own blood, increasing their red blood cells, endurance, and oxygen capacity (It is most likely due to her being a Blue). This ended her career as a professional swimmer. Aspen was disqualified from the 1988 competition, banned from the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games, and \"disgraced her country.\" After this tragedy, she became a Marine Biologist in order to have a job that kept her in the water most of the time.</p><h3>Blue Sun</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177592\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177592-156709-aspen.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.7725\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177592-156709-aspen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177592\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177592-156709-aspen.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177592-156709-aspen.jpg 400w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177592-156709-aspen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Aspen is now a marine biologist and was at San Diego, <a href=\"/california/4020-55716/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55716\">California</a> swimming around. Aspen was getting ready to go to the airport because she was invited to join a team that was investigating a strange ship they had found at the bottom of the sea as well as its occupant, Killian. The ship couldn't be moved, so the team was set up at a <a href=\"/deep-marine-discovery/4020-55981/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55981\">DMD</a> base (Deep Marine Discovery) beneath the sea near the ship. She didn't know it at the time, but the ship belonged to her people and they were watching the human scientists. Unfortunately for Aspen, she was forced to travel to the DMD base with her ex-boyfriend from her first research job, Jack. Upon arriving at the DMD base, she was introduced to the Director of DMD, Alexander Jarvis, who took Aspen and Jack on a tour. After Director Jarvis showed Aspen the Blue’s ship, she catches her first glimpse of <a href=\"/cannon-hawke/4005-41254/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41254\">Cannon Hawke</a>. She later began doing her job and started analyzing the ship trying to figure out its origin. Afterwards, Director Jarvis would take Aspen to the laboratory, where he shows her Killian. Aspen was shocked to discover that this is the same species that she encountered when she was young. At the same time, a pilot of the US Navy named <a href=\"/chance-calloway/4005-46650/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46650\">Chance</a> was testing out a prototype plane that could fly underwater. He encountered some of the Blue and fired a torpedo at them. However, they avoided it and the missile headed straight for the DMD base instead. The missile then locked on to the heat signature of the power generators and headed straight for it. It destroys the generator and things seemed to calm at first. However, rocks broke apart and fell on to the DMD. Eventually, the crew would all be killed when water begun flooding the base. Director Jarvis took a Blue armor and left while everyone else was fending for their lives. Aspen and Jack were locked in the laboratory as it was the only thing keeping the water out. Eventually, the water would break through and begin flooding the lab. Jack tries to reconcile with Aspen, but Aspen decides to free Killian in the tank hoping he could save them, but was not able to break the tube and free Killian. the water began to fill up quickly and Aspen found herself engulfed in water. As she stood there underwater, she eventually passed out. Killian was able to break out of the tube, he then grabs Aspen and pulls her out of the base. As Killian continues to pull her, he is attacked by a stranger that made of water. The two battle, but Killian has back-up arrive. Fortunately for the water stranger, humans arrived. The water stranger then touched Aspen and activated her powers. Chance is able to recover Aspen and takes her to the Oahu General Hospital at Honolulu, <a href=\"/hawaii/4020-56180/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56180\">Hawaii</a>. At the hospital, the doctors do some tests on Aspen and discover abnormality in her body. She has something that looks similar to a tumor in her brain, but it's actually just brain tissue. They also discover that she had four to five times the lung capacity of an Olympic swimmer.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177637\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177637-30166-aspen.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5425\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177637-30166-aspen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177637\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177637-30166-aspen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177637-30166-aspen.jpg 400w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177637-30166-aspen.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177637-30166-aspen.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177637-30166-aspen.jpg 400w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177637-30166-aspen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Aspen eventually reawakens two days later and was greeted by <a href=\"/akiko-nigata/4005-48764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48764\">Akiko</a> ( Cannon Hawke’s assistant). The two begin to talk about how they were able to escape and that it was a sign to start a new life. Aspen was still confused at how she was able to escape and remembered the “ocean” was talking to her. Aspen would soon be released from the hospital and was allowed to return to her home in San Diego. Chance would eventually meet up with Aspen at her San Diego home. He talks to her about how he saw her dissolve into water just like the enemy that he was firing at. The next morning, Aspen went to buy some bagels where she was drugged and abducted by some government lackeys. Meanwhile, Cannon had been keeping an eye on Aspen from a distance and immediately followed her as soon as she was kidnapped. Aspen was soon turned over to Killian, however, Cannon was able to retrieve Aspen from Killian. Killian was able to retake Aspen from Cannon. Cannon then fought one of his men and was able to render him unconscious. Aspen was allowed to swim around for awhile as she continued to try and figure out some answers. However, her fun soon stopped as Killian and his army confronted her. Killian tells her the truth about her origins and also tells her of their plans to fight the humans, who endanger their way of life. Aspen became excited that she is now living a fantasy in reality, and Killian begins to teach her to control her powers. Aspen was soon ready and she would be put to the test. Off the shores of <a href=\"/costa-rica/4020-56465/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56465\">Costa Rica</a>, Killian planned for Aspen to attack a Japanese Naval facility while he and others backed her up if she makes any mistakes. They would engage against a group of soldiers and Aspen makes her first kill.</p><p>The humans had tested a hydrogen bomb and had accidentally destroyed a Blue city, causing a lot of commotion among the Blue. Killian had always hated humans but with the destruction of a city, he was able to gather followers. At the time it wasn't known why, but Aspen had water controlling abilities far greater than other <a href=\"/blue/4060-41253/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41253\">Blues</a>. (This was because she was part <a href=\"/black/4060-41246/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41246\">Black</a>, but that wasn't revealed until much later.) Killian planned to have Aspen use these abilities to power a massive energy source known as the Blue Sun which they would use as a weapon against the humans. Back at <a href=\"/easter-island-rapa-nui/4020-56320/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56320\">Easter Island</a>, Killian had Aspen prepare herself to operate the Apparatus. Aspen is successful in activating it and shortly afterwards, she has a little chat with Kyla, who tells her not to let Killian push her around. Next, Kyla and Aspen headed near <a href=\"/new-zealand/4020-55921/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55921\">New Zealand</a>, where the second installation of the Apparatus was located. Aspen meets <a href=\"/taras/4005-41492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41492\">Taras</a> and then activated it easily. Next, they headed for another Apparatus installation at a place where a Blue army was gathering. As they readied Aspen to power the final installation, but Cannon Hawke and his team arrives just before she was to activate it. Kyla then revealed that she was working for Cannon undercover and a battle ensues. Aspen was pinned down by Taras, but was easily defeated. Cannon tries to reason with Aspen but she knocks him away from her. After Cannon talks to Chance on his ear piece, Aspen finally calms down. Meanwhile, Killian had allied himself with Director Jarvis, and without Aspen, he is forced to use the water stranger that saved Aspen earlier. Kyla reveals to Aspen that Killian has lied to Aspen and she tried to keep Aspen sane for the time being. Taras then kills Kyla while she was talking to Aspen. It quickly angered Aspen and she displays the potential of her power. They picked up Kyla and headed to rescue Chance, who was drowning in Cannon’s ship. They hide in a safe spot where Kyla told her that they weren't a warlike race and that most Blue didn't want to kill the humans. Kyla dies soon afterwards. Cannon then reveals her past to her, he tells Aspen that she was well loved as a child of the Blue, and that her parents were well respected. He reveals that she had a brother, and when she was eleven years old, she and her brother were swimming outside their parent’s place when an attack happened. Her parents were killed and Cannon was rendered useless. The perpetrator was Killian and his Dissidents. Aspen would unleash her latent ability and was able to escape. Aspen realized her mistake and went with Cannon to stop Killian.</p><p>By the time they reached him, Killian had already activated the Blue Sun and a beam of energy was blasting from space and making a hole in the ocean, and the energy was getting stronger every second. Aspen, Chance, and Cannon headed for a place called the Chanarnay, which translates to “Valley of Stairs” and is a historical place for the Blue. Cannon then tells Aspen that if Killian succeeds in drilling a hole there, it would become a big catastrophe. Killian would fire a blast at Cannon, and then Cannon engages against Taras. Cannon eventually throws Taras into the Blue Light. The Blue beam would cause the ground to break, causing Aspen and Killian to fall below. Aspen was knocked out and Killian threw her in the beam, he then began battling Cannon. The beam had destroyed Aspen's body, but she reformed herself out of a mixture of energy and water. She came back out just as Killian was beating Cannon. She took Killian apart molecule by molecule and told Cannon to run while she stopped the Blue Sun. Turning fully into energy, she flew up to the Sun and destroyed it, causing a chain reaction which destroyed the three Apparatus. The hole in the ocean closed up and just when Cannon had given up on the thought that Aspen had survived, she came up out of the water looking completely normal.</p><h3>Baha and Big Moe</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177666\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177666-161848-aspen.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177666-161848-aspen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177666\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177666-161848-aspen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177666-161848-aspen.jpg 400w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177666-161848-aspen.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177666-161848-aspen.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177666-161848-aspen.jpg 400w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177666-161848-aspen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After the events of Blue Sun, a monster appeared at Sea World during one of Shamu’s shows. Meanwhile, Aspen had been staying at her place near the beach while Chance laid low, as he was still U.A. (Unauthorized Absence). While Aspen was surfing, she encounters the giant monster and decides to swim after it. A weird vehicle swims right by Aspen and she sees a man saluting her inside. Back at home, she tries to research the monster on the internet. Someone knocks on her door and Aspen opens it to see an old man who does not know who she is or why she is there. They talk for a while and it only confuses Aspen more. After the lights go out, she lights a candle he begins acting like he remembers what he was supposed to do. He puts his helmet on Aspen and tells her to go outside and in his self-made submarine to go after <a href=\"/big-moe/4005-41348/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41348\">Big Moe</a>. She somehow became part of his team and they both went after the sea monster together on his weird, self-made submarine. He tells her his name is <a href=\"/baha/4005-41349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41349\">Baha</a> and proceeds to putting on armor for Aspen to protect her. They found the beast, however, there was more then one. Eventually, Aspen would have to leave the submarine and fight the three beasts. Aspen did not want to kill the creature, but was forced to kill two of them. However, she did let one of them go since the old man will never actually capture it. After a short fight in which Aspen and Baha (the old man) almost died, Big Moe escaped. Aspen didn't follow Baha as he left to continue the hunt, she had already had too much adventure in the short time they spent together.</p><h3>The Arctic Blue</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-435106\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/435106-sara_lara_aspen.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4433333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/435106-sara_lara_aspen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-435106\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/435106-sara_lara_aspen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/435106-sara_lara_aspen.jpg 600w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/435106-sara_lara_aspen.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/435106-sara_lara_aspen.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/435106-sara_lara_aspen.jpg 600w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/435106-sara_lara_aspen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Aspen is taking a vacation in the mountains, snowboarding with her roommate Tyler Kincair. The duo are forced to return early from their trip as Tyler injures her ankle on the ski slopes. Meanwhile, after spending a night with <a href=\"/lara-croft/4005-40491/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40491\">Lara Croft</a>, Cannon Hawke is kidnapped by agents of the <a href=\"/arctic-blue/4060-41345/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41345\">Arctic Blue</a>. Their leader <a href=\"/vana/4005-41347/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41347\">Vana</a>'s son (Taras) was killed by Cannon during the events of Blue Sun and she wanted to fix that. She planned to use Cannon's body to remake her son, so she had <a href=\"/biranha/4005-41493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41493\">Biranha</a>, her other son, abduct him. Lara soon discovered him missing and contacted her friend <a href=\"/sara-pezzini/4005-18318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18318\">Sara Pezzini</a> to have her get Aspen, since Cannon had been talking about her and Lara knew what she was capable of. Aspen and Sara went to meet up with Lara but before they could, they too were attacked by the Arctic Blue. Sara uses her <a href=\"/witchblade/4005-18319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18319\">Witchblade</a> but one of the Arctic Blue liquefied himself and disappeared. She went to check up on Aspen, who had been thrown through a window into a club. They were then confronted by the other Arctic Blues and were kidnapped and brought to their base. Lara watched from a distance and evaded capture, she eventually made her way to the base to bust everyone out. Meanwhile, after Sara and Aspen woke up, Aspen told her about the underwater race and Sara told her about the Witchblade. Lara infiltrated the Arctic Blue’s base and snuck around until she found Cannon, horribly disfigured. Lara confronts Biranha and Vana, then begins shooting at them. They attacked back and Lara was forced to retreat. Meanwhile, Sara would use the Witchblade to destroy the machine that was holding them. Lara then comes through the door to greet the two. Lara escorts the two out of the base as there would be more room to fight outside. Lara then reveals that Cannon had been altered and that she owed a debt to him, and also that he was one of her few friend. She then tells the two how she met Cannon. Lara had been offered a job to retrieve a jewel where one of her top competition failed. Lara arrived at the last know area where her competition was and grabbed the jewel. However, a boulder fell onto her and trapped her. She would reawaken to see that Cannon had rescued her. Cannon dives off her yacht and she turns the jewel over to the person who offered her a job. Cannon shows up as an acquaintance of the buyer, surprising Lara. Lara then tells the two that this place is like a military complex, and they headed for a vacant ship to retrieve the Arctic Blue’s weapons. The three of them went back for Cannon and would be discovered, Lara shoots and destroys their ship and causes the ground to break. Sara falls through the hole and finds herself in another level of the complex. Lara and Aspen headed for Cannon while Sara was captured by the Arctic Blue. The Arctic Blue then threw Sara in the water and proceeded to “practice” on her. Sara uses her Witchblade to defeat the Arctic Blues that were attacking her under water. Aspen ended up fighting Vana while the Lara got Cannon and Sara battle Biranha. Vana would overpower Aspen and began freezing her, however, Aspen would stab Vana with one of the icicles on her face. With Cannon free, Taras' body (which had been using Cannon's body to grow) died and Vana went mad with grief, destroying the entire mountain base in a blast of ice.

Later, she quietly stands above the ocean to gather her thoughts. Aspen then fell into the water and sees a ship emerge. She meets <a href=\"/kiani/4005-41256/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41256\">Kiani</a>, Killian's daughter for the first time, who was with Cannon. Kiani tells Aspen if she wanted to learn about her parents, then to come with them. They realize that balls of water began forming near major cities. Aspen meets <a href=\"/casque/4005-41451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41451\">Casque</a> for the first time and begun asking questions. However, they were interrupted by a group of dark dwellers, who had broken through their ship. A battle breaks out and Kiani was able to fend off some of the dwellers from Aspen. Aspen then gets abducted by one of the dwellers that emerge out of the ocean. They took Aspen down under the ocean to another underworld city inhabited by a race called \"The Black\". Aspen discovers Casque in one of the rooms. Casque tells Aspen that the only way for him to find her was to follow his brethren the Black. Casque tells her that he will answer all her questions and begins telling her the history of the Black and Blue. Casque reveals that the Black are regarded as “Gods” to the Blue and that Aspen is a hybrid of a “mortal” and a “God,” which is why Killian killed her parents and tried to manipulate her. Casque then offers to introduce Aspen to her biological father. Aspen meets her biological father, Ragher. Aspen learns that her mother, who was a Blue, was secretly in love with a Ragher, who was a Black. Therefore Aspen is half Blue and half Black and is the reason why she has such extraordinary control over water. Ragher tells her that the reason he decided to contact her now is that because their worlds are in peril. He reveals that he needs her to punish the humans for their wrong doings. Aspen, who had heard the same thing from Killian, uses her powers and pushes her father away. As Aspen attempts to leave the city, she discovers similar markings to the area where she killed Killian.</p><p>When Aspen returns to the surface, she heads back to her home. However, her roommate had a job overseas and there was a new and dirty roommate. She went to her room and grab a few stuff before she tried calling her father, Captain Matthews. Captain Matthews did not pick up and Aspen did not know what to do, eventually she stumbles across a magazine with a jet pilot on it, and remembers about Chance. Aspen uses her abilities to sneak into the men’s locker room while Chance was showering. Chance later tells Aspen that Admiral <a href=\"/james-maylander/4005-46345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46345\">Maylander</a> had attacked one of the underwater cities. Chance decides to help Aspen out searching for Captain Matthews. At a gas station, Aspen tells Chance about what had transpired recently and they would continue their search for Captain Matthews. They eventually arrived at Captain Matthew’s home in the desert to find no one there, but the door was unlocked. They enter the home and Aspen finds Captain Matthews in his room lying on his bed. They quickly find out that it was a trap and all three of them are locked in the house. Aspen uses her powers to bust out of the house, but she is shot down by the army. They hop into Chance’s car and drive away, Aspen had began to dehydrate. They eventually end up at Hoover Dam and tosses Aspen into the water. The army arrive shortly afterwards and subdued Captain Matthews and Chance. Luckily, Aspen regains her powers and unleashes her power on the army. A missile was launched at Aspen but ends up exploding on the dam, releasing tons of water. Aspen uses her powers to create a storm for the three of them to escape. She talks with Captain Matthews for a bit then talked with Chance, revealing her feelings for him and kisses him. A mysterious water figure emerges from the water and Aspen would reunite with her long lost brother, Finn, who mysteriously saved her during the Blue Sun. The army started to attack their underwater cities which nearly triggers a massive war. However, Aspen comes and helps fend off the army and since The Blue received so much damage, they could not retaliate.</p><p>Finn asks Aspen to take him to Saba, the underwater city. However, once they arrived all they found were ruins. The humans were still there and began attacking Finn. Aspen catches Finn and protects him from incoming fire, long enough for Cannon to arrive with a ship and rescue the two. Finn reveals to Aspen that when they were escaping from Killian, he was shot by a beam transforming him to the water form, while Aspen was lost on the Paradise ship. They finally arrive at Muria where the ensuing battle between the Blue and the humans were taking place. Aspen jumps right in to help the Blue. After all the destruction, Aspen could not take it anymore and decides to unleash her full potential. She knocks the human ships out of the water and began attacking the Navy. Aspen eventually destroys most of the ships, ending the war. Aspen then met up with Captain Matthews and Chance at a house in <a href=\"/mexico/4020-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55820\">Mexico</a>.</p><p>A few months after the war ends, the Black has planned on destroying the humans and the Blue, while Cannon found out about their movement. He also discover that Aspen's brother wasn't really him at all, it was Killian who was portraying as Finn all along and he told Aspen the truth about Killian. Kiani, now has her hatred on the humans joins her father to attack the humans while the Black destroys Rio de Janiero with great power of water. Aspen and Chance go on a rescue mission to save Finn from Chance's brother, Chris Calloway. The three finally reached Muria and Aspen confront Killian, but Killian wants to help her and her friends to defeat the Black, but Kiani has her ways by not joining with her father and she still wants revenge on the humans. Killian joins Aspen, Cannon and the rest of the Blue to fight the Black in Turkey where Maylander and his soldiers preparing to fight and allied with the Blue. As the Black prepare to attack the human surface for a final showdown with the Blue and the humans, Aspen confronts her father, Ragher once again. She fights back using her powers of the Black to defeat him, but Ragher's powers managed to electrocute her until Chance fires him with a experimental weapon that dries him up. While trying to help him get back in the water to recover, Ragher shows Aspen's true birthmark that she's still one of the Black. Aspen uses her power to stop the rest of the Black, but Casque who was on Ragher's side reveals to Aspen and told her the war is over and they took Ragher back to the deep for recovery. Aspen and Killian returned to the surface and Aspen found out that Kiani has killed Cannon. Aspen and Kiani fight against each other for the first time, but Aspen manages to destroy Kiani with the same power that she used against Killian. Back in Muria, Aspen and allies mourn Cannon's death and Killian and his wife mourn their daughter. Aspen says goodbye to Chance and Finn and promise she'll return to see them. Aspen goes for a swim to continue her life and adventure.</p><h2><b>Powers &amp; Abilities</b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-772644\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/772644-fathomv2_7b.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.518\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/772644-fathomv2_7b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-772644\"><img alt=\"Aspen using her water abilities\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/772644-fathomv2_7b.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/772644-fathomv2_7b.jpg 500w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/772644-fathomv2_7b.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Aspen using her water abilities\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/772644-fathomv2_7b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/772644-fathomv2_7b.jpg 500w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/772644-fathomv2_7b.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Aspen using her water abilities</figcaption></figure><p>Aspen's unique heritage provides her with amazing powers. Like all Blue, she can manipulate water, but since she is also a Black she can do this to a much greater degree than other Blues. She can instantly form massive waves and tsunamis without even thinking about it, as well as control the oceans if storms or other things cause them to become destructive. Her powers don't only work on a large scale though; she can form water into solid shapes or even make it sturdy enough to walk on. Aspen can control all liquid, allowing her to even change the flow of blood in someone's body or rip it out to kill them. She can change her physical body into water, letting it disperse and being able to pull herself back together. She also has the potential for massive amounts of ice control, though it hasn't been shown yet. As a Black she is capable of healing wounds (even fatal ones), shooting blasts of energy from her hands and becoming energy herself. She has been shown to have had her body destroyed and to remake it out of energy and water. She also has telepathy, but she's only used it with the Blacks, who are telepaths themselves.</p><p>Aside from her powers, Aspen is physically in great condition. Even before she knew about her powers, she was an Olympic swimmer and always kept in shape. Her <a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/414448-anatomy_super.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">basic biology</a> is slightly different than other humans in that she has some additional brain tissue, her red-cell density is twice the average, she has the more flexible bone structure of someone still growing, and she naturally has 5 times the lung capacity of an Olympic swimmer. Aspen is also very intelligent and extremely knowledgeable about things involving water and the ocean thanks to her extensive education and experience as a marine biologist.</p><h2><b>Characteristics</b></h2><ul><li><b>Height</b>: 5' 6\"</li><li><b>Weight</b>: 120 lbs</li><li><b>Eyes</b>: Blue</li><li><b>Hair</b>: Blackish Blue</li></ul><h2>Other Recognition</h2><p>Aspen Matthews was ranked #46 in Comic Buyer's Guide's <a href=\"/comics-buyers-guide-presents-2-100-sexiest-women-i/4000-463770/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-463770\">100 Sexiest Women in Comics</a> list.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

He patrolled the border between Heaven and Hell, and he did his job well.  Until he met the demon.</p><p>She was beautiful, dark and dangerous.  Against his very nature, he went to her, and they fell in love.  They mated, knowing that they were doomed by doing so, and their child was the being known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10533\" href=\"/genesis/4005-10533/\">Genesis</a>.</p><p>When Genesis was born, God fled Heaven.  The other angels put the Seraphim on trial and banished him to Earth, where he was seen falling by a pilot for the US Air Force.  The US government notified <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41404\" href=\"/the-grail/4060-41404/\">The Grail</a>, a powerful group of apocalyptic Christians, who took the angel into custody.</p><p>The Seraphim was held in chains at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41400\" href=\"/masada/4020-41400/\">Masada</a>, the headquarters for The Grail in France.  He gave information to The Grail on God's disappearance and the creation of Genesis.  When The Grail wanted truth, they took it to the Seraphim.</p><p>Hoping for release from his imprisonment, the Seraphim tried to help <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\">Jesse Custer</a> learn how to talk to Genesis - he advised that Custer seek out the old ways of the Native Americans.  That way, Custer could learn all he needed to if he wanted to control Genesis.</p><p>The Seraphim was killed by God, who named him \"Betrayer\" before burning him to death in the caverns below Masada.</p>",

    "deck": "Jack Bauer is a highly trained anti-terrorist agent from the 24 tv show.  Being a highly skilled operative, he frequently beats the odds and has made great personal sacrifices in order to serve and protect his country and loved ones.",
    "description": "<h2><span>Origin</span></h2><p>Jack Bauer was born on February 18, 1966 to Philip Bauer, (mother unknown) in Santa Monica California. He grew up, never really close to either his father or his brother Graem, though he appeared to be close to the family's butler Sam. In High School Jack liked motorcycles and was reported to surf for fun. The real source of scorn from his family came when Jack was supposed to run BXJ Technologies, his father's company. Jack decided to go his own way and enter the army. Jack was a member of the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, and was a member of the Los Angeles Police Department's SWAT team. Jack went on to do field work for the CIA, as a case officer in Clandestine Services.</p><h2><span>Creation</span></h2><p>Jack appears in the <a data-ref-id=\"4010-1190\" href=\"/idw-publishing/4010-1190/\" slug=\"idw-publishing\">IDW Publishing</a> comic book adaptations of the hit TV drama 24. He was brought to comics by writers <a data-ref-id=\"4040-55824\" href=\"/j-c-vaughn/4040-55824/\" slug=\"j-c-vaughn\">J. C. Vaughn</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-59372\" href=\"/mark-l-haynes/4040-59372/\" slug=\"mark-l-haynes\">Mark L. Haynes</a> with art by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-43012\" href=\"/renato-guedes/4040-43012/\" slug=\"renato-guedes\">Renato Guedes</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Though he begins his career as a government agent as a capable, sound bodied man, Jack Bauer ultimately ends up broken by lives and loves lost. The murder of his wife by a former paramour drives Jack into revenge and self-abuse, even going so far as to get addicted to heroine in the course of a job. Jack is framed countless times by enemies for crimes - even once by his own government. Jack is taken prisoner and tortured by China; his girlfriend Audrey gets brain-washed; close friends are killed. By the end of Jack's tenure as a government agent, he accepts his broken life without family and without love.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Against all odds, Jack keeps a beautiful terrorist alive despite only having one bullet in his gun. He also stops terrorists from destroying experimentation on the United State's underwater oil reserves. He also attempts to take down mass-murderer Victor Drazen.</p><h2>Skills and Traits</h2><p>Jack Bauer has no apparent super-powers. He is a highly trained field agent with experience stemming from his time in the Army, on a SWAT team, the CIA, and CTU. Jack Bauer's Special Ops training makes him an expert combatant, capable of taking down professional assassins unarmed. He has an extensive knowledge of pressure points, nerve sensitivities, and stealth attack and techniques. Jack is a great interrogator and is able to use his vast knowledge of the human anatomy and torture techniques to bring even the most determined or strong willed enemy to their knees. He also is capable of wielding many different firearms, from pistols to sniper rifles, with deadly accuracy. He also has extensive experience with technological gadgets to assist him in the field. Jack seems to have a high level of stamina and has thwarted major terrorist schemes within a 24 hour time period while going through intense emotional conflict and huge amounts of stress without breaking down. Jack also has a remarkable resistance for pain and is highly durable, being able the still walk after multiple gunshot wounds and other serious injuries.</p><p>Jack's willpower is nigh unable to be overcome, he will only compromise his mission or put his country on the line if the lives of many people or loved ones are threatened. Once he is focused on an assignment, it seems Jack is able to continue without sleep, food, or going to the bathroom. Jack is willing to break any laws and moral standards in order to save lives. It seems that, in Jack Bauer's eyes, the ends justify the means but he has responded that he is simply required to \"finish the mission at all costs\" when he is activated.</p>",

In the depths of the ocean amongst the <a href=\"/blue/4060-41253/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41253\"> Blue</a>, he is the Elite Commander of Council Defense. On the surface he runs a consulting firm that specializes in governmental relations between the American and Japanese government, but he holds no official alliance with either. His goal is the same above and under the surface, to ensure the safety of the blue. But he wish to do so with minimal casualties on both sides, humans and Blue’s.</p><h2><b> Blue Sun</b></h2><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177614\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177614-140696-aspen.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.9725\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177614-140696-aspen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177614\"><img alt=\"Aspen Matthews\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177614-140696-aspen.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177614-140696-aspen.jpg 400w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177614-140696-aspen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Aspen Matthews</figcaption></figure><p>Cannon was the bodyguard of <a href=\"/aspen-matthews/4005-41245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41245\">Aspen Matthews</a> and her family back when she was little. When <a href=\"/killian/4005-41255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41255\"> Killian</a> killed her family, Cannon was injured so he could no longer protect her. He learned of her whereabouts, and how she was raised by the human called <a href=\"/captain-matthews/4005-46681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46681\"> Captain Matthews</a>. It would be a good way to learn of the surface world he thought, so she would gain an advantage over both the Blue’s and the humans. In this time Cannon had started working on the surface world at the <a href=\"/deep-marine-discovery/4020-55981/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55981\"> DMD</a> (Deep Marine Discovery), It was an undersea base built by the humans to investigate a Blue ship they found. Cannon worked there as an emissary between the and the Japanese government on behalf of his own consulting firm. had become a marine biologist and was asked by the DMDto join them in their research. This would be the first time since 15 years Cannon and would meet again without her knowing about it. Killian allowed himself to be captured at this base to get close to .</p><p>At the same time a pilot of the US Navy named <a href=\"/chance-calloway/4005-46650/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46650\"> Chance Calloway</a> was testing out a prototype plane that could fly underwater. He encountered some of the Blue and fired a torpedo at them. However, they avoided it and the missile headed straight for the DMD base instead. The force of the explosion caused the base to fill with water drowning almost all of the personnel on the base. Cannon’s assistant <a href=\"/akiko-nigata/4005-48764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48764\"> Akiko</a> did not know of Cannon’s powers, so he waited for the base to fill with water before safely bringing her to the surface. In this time was saved by the very pilot who blew up the base. While quickly recovered from her wounds Cannon kept an eye out on her. When one morning she went to buy bagels she was drugged and kidnapped by what looked to be government agents. They turn her over to Killian's troops. After an acrobatic stunt in which Cannon drives with his motorcycle from a cliff into the sea he manages to reach Aspen and knock one of her kidnappers out, Cannon retrieved and grabbed the man’s sea vehicle. After a wild chase the vehicle is blown up and gets retaken by one of the men. Leaving Cannon to battle it out with another, which Cannon wins. He takes the man with him for interrogation, to find out where they’ve taken aspen, the base of Killian. But this place was protected by the best guards Killian had, he couldn’t risk his own life because no-one would be there to take his place in this time of need. So he decided to wait, hoping he could undo whatever Killian was doing to her at a later point in time.</p><figure style=\"width: 352px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-400942\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13945/400942-180735-killian.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.8181818181818\" data-width=\"352\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:181.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13945/400942-180735-killian.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-400942\"><img alt=\"Killian\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13945/400942-180735-killian.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13945/400942-180735-killian.jpg 352w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13945/400942-180735-killian.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Killian</figcaption></figure><p>In this time Cannon helped Chance ( Aspen’s boyfriend) with an attack from three men and asks for his help to retrieve her. had been under control of Killian and starting up Apparatus installations around the world to power a powerful weapon.

There she stood face to face with the horribly scarred Cannon Hawke, discovered by her enemies she had to make a run for it. While getting away she found the whereabouts of Sara and Aspen and with them they escaped the base. As they get ready for the counter attack Lara explains to Sara and Aspen how she and Cannon met and what she means to him. When they had gotten the weapons from Cannon’s boat, they made their way back to the base and attacked. In the first attack Sara fell through the ice in the icy waters below her where more Arctic Blue’s were waiting for her. In full control of the Witchblade she disposed of her enemies but then faced Biranha. While Aspen and Lara made their way towards Cannon. In the meantime Cannon was being ripped apart by the machine in an attempt to separate the mind and body of Taras and Cannon. They were now two separate beings again, their bodies no longer disfigured. Lara and Aspen had reached them, while Aspen fought with Vana, Lara tried to rescue Cannon from his captivity and Aspen was almost beaten by Vana’s ice powers before she broke one of the icicles from her face and stabbed Vana with it.</p><p>Out of anger she shot an iceblast towards Aspen but missed her and hit her son Taras instead which seemingly killed him again. In this time Sara defeated Biranha after a short fight and made her way up to the rest while Lara had freed Cannon. Out of rage and grief Vana exploded in ice destroying the entire base. Lara, Sara, Aspen and Cannon barely made it before it was too late. But the Witchblade helped them in a miraculous save. What was unknown was that while Cannon felt and acted normal the mind of was now stored inside his body, not yet surfacing.</p><p><strong><em>Note:</em> </strong>Michael Turner remastered the issues of the crossover of Fathom since he left Image Top Cow.

In an intercepted e-mail he found coordinates to Saba, the e-mail originated from . This would be his next place to visit together with Akiko. He went to see a man in the Dendou Daikoku (a casino in ), his name was Shalla Barnic a.k.a. The Shark. He was a weapon dealer who sold information to Maylander from the US Government. After a quick talk that led to nothing he went back to his hotel where he was attacked by several of The Shark’s men. Cannon was able to take out some but in the end was taken out via an electrical shock. He quickly recovered and killed the two men, by changing the flow of blood in their bodies. But this was done by Taras who had quickly taken over Cannon’s body. But it was already too late, the men had left with a vial that Cannon always carried with him, in it was water supercharged by the Blue Sun. In the meantime Cannon had a battle with in his mind but it seemed real, he regained his sense in a café. He looked confused around him to see what had happened but he didn’t quite know himself. He could still hear his voice inside his head. He said things he would normally never say but couldn’t control himself.</p><p>Until he saw Akiko, he regained his sense and walked with her on the streets explaining to her what is happening with him, how he hears voices but not telling her that he’s really a Blue. Akiko tells Cannon where The Shark is and what he does, how he runs a factory which specializes in energy extraction to energy production, spending a great deal of fortune in hydro power. Cannon makes his way over to the factory just in time to see The Shark leave in a boat. Without time to waste he jumped in the water and grabbed one of the jet ski’s to follow him. He was attacked by three men on jet ski’s but managed to take them out, yet wasn’t in time to stop The Shark from leaving. In the meantime Cannon was stopped by some agents and took him as a ‘guest’ to the same place as The Shark was going to, a research facility from the japan where they investigated the fluid for limitless energy, it was revealed to be gray matter. When Cannon and The Shark left the facility Biranha attacked the it killing everyone there and taking the vial with liquid for himself. But the Japanese government thinks Cannon stole it and tries to apprehend him but Cannon and Akiko manages to outrun them in a car chase. Afterwards he send Akiko away on a plane to ensure her safety while he went after The Shark. He broke into his office and took out his personal bodyguard by letting take control of his body for a couple of seconds and freeze the liquid in his body. Afterwards he started interrogating The Shark about his double crossing. The Shark says it was all the idea of Biranha, Cannon is obviously surprised by this because Cannon thought he was dead, took advantage of this to take over his mind for a while but it blacked him out, when he woke up, The Shark was gone. Without time to waste he gathered three of his friends (also Blue’s) and took off towards the arctic tundra where they hoped to find Biranha and the gray matter.</p><figure style=\"width: 1010px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598654\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5841584158416\" data-width=\"1010\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598654\"><img alt=\"Cannon vs Taras\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg 1010w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg 960w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cannon vs Taras\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg 1010w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg 960w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/598654-cannonhawke5010.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cannon vs Taras</figcaption></figure><p>After a brief fight with two other planes he manages to get the upper hand and take them out. Leading his group into a cave where they encounter Biranha, after a brief fight Cannon is held by two men while Biranha stands ready to kill him. Just when he’s about to strike gains control of Cannon’s body, Biranha quickly recognizes his brothers voice and personality and stops. Cannon’s team managed to get the upper hand, when their opponents fled they were left fighting in Cannon’s body but they managed to overpower him and take him outside where he regained control of his mind again. Cannon thanks them and send them away, knowing he won’t be able to trust himself and he wished to do them no harm. He goes back to Akiko and tells her the truth, how he’s not a human but a Blue, about in his head and how he has to take back control of his mind. He locked himself in a steel room with no way out, Akiko stood on the other side of the door and could only open the door if she knew for sure it was Cannon who spoke and not Taras. And if Cannon lost the battle for his mind, would forever be locked in that room by Akiko. Against he fought in his mind with Taras, in the meantime Taras took control of his body and pretended to be Cannon to let Akiko open the door, but she wasn’t fooled by his trickery. At first Cannon was losing the battle with Taras, but then he remembered where he beat him before, in the battle at the Blue Sun.</p><p>He imagined it in his mind and after a brief fight he threw him into the energy beam, killing him in his mind forever. Akiko quickly recognized Cannon and opened the door to let him out where they had an emotional talk and she kissed him to remind why he should come back to the surface world. After this he had to join his people in the sea, but would never forget about Akiko and visit her again.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><figure style=\"width: 444px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598673\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/598673-cannonhawke1_1612.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.52927927927928\" data-width=\"444\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/598673-cannonhawke1_1612.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598673\"><img alt=\"Hydro-kinesis\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/598673-cannonhawke1_1612.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/598673-cannonhawke1_1612.jpg 444w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/598673-cannonhawke1_1612.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hydro-kinesis\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/598673-cannonhawke1_1612.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/598673-cannonhawke1_1612.jpg 444w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/598673-cannonhawke1_1612.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hydro-kinesis</figcaption></figure><p>Cannon Hawke has the same powers as any Blue.

But the Blue are aware of the humans, they have agents throughout the hierarchy of the humans but they could not foresee a test with a hydrogen bomb the humans did out on the ocean. Below the test site was a Blue city, it was completely decimated by the humans. Thousands of Blue’s perished during this explosion but the humans were not aware of this fact. The council of the Blue’s debated whether to go to war with the humans while Killian wakes up after a nightmare where he and his brother were hiding in the bushes while his parents were slaughtered by humans. After he recovers he joins his brother <a href=\"/sear/4005-48644/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48644\"> Sear</a> listening to the decision of the council, they decide to continue the monitor the situation and not attack. This angers Killian, Sear and their young friends called the dissidents, and decide to take matters into their own hands. They decide to blow up a power station of the humans. They succeed in doing so without making any casualties thanks to Sear, they continued to do these hit and run actions without crossing the line of killing people but Killian did not agree with Sear’s leadership.</p><p>The Blue gained suspicions of who was doing these hit and run tactics and decided to have Killian followed. This ultimately led them to Killian’s girlfriend's (<a href=\"/anya/4005-46346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46346\"> Anya</a>) father who was in the council and wanted the Blue to attack the humans. He offers Killian the resources to do more then just petty attacks and tells him his parents were killed by the humans, that his dreams were actually true. This in turn angers Killian. He fights with Sear about not telling him how his parents died and that he does not agree with his leadership, they should punish the humans. But Sear does not agree with Killian and decides not to join their new mission which involves retrieving documents from the manufacturer of the hydrogen bomb on the base on an island which employed it. They succeeded but by making human casualties. Anya is sickened by the new character Killian developed.</p><p>Sear confronts Killian again, trying to convince him this is not the right way. Killian fights with his brother, finally Sear wins and tells Killian he wants nothing to do with it and walks away. Anya decides to leave him after this. Sear contacts <a href=\"/cannon-hawke/4005-41254/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41254\"> Cannon Hawke</a> and tells him what had transpired whom in turn tells the council. They decide they need to have an inside person to tell them what’s going on decide on Anya.</p><blockquote><p><i>‘My friends, I’ve spent most of my life dreaming about today, because TODAY… we leave behind our waterbound roots and take to the planet at large, a planet that by rights belong to us.’ - Killian</i></p></blockquote><p> </p><figure style=\"width: 639px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-642255\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/642255-killian24.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.6697965571205\" data-width=\"639\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/642255-killian24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-642255\"><img alt=\"Killed his own brother\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/642255-killian24.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25521/642255-killian24.jpg 639w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/25521/642255-killian24.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25521/642255-killian24.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Killed his own brother</figcaption></figure><p>Killians and his dissidents attacked an army base, killing many and stole a hydrogen bomb from the humans.

He wanted to raise her himself because she was a mixture between the Black and the Blue and thus very powerful. He learned of her whereabouts, and how she was raised by the human called <a href=\"/captain-matthews/4005-46681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46681\"> Captain Matthews</a>. She was invited to work at the <a href=\"/deep-marine-discovery/4020-55981/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55981\"> DMD</a> (Deep Marine Discovery), It was an undersea base built by the humans to investigate a Blue ship they found. Killian allowed himself to be captured at this base to get close to her. Aspen would research him. At the same time a pilot of the US Navy named <a href=\"/chance-calloway/4005-46650/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46650\"> Chance Calloway</a> was testing out a prototype plane that could fly underwater. He encountered some of the Blue and fired a torpedo at them.</p><p>However, they avoided it and the missile headed straight for the DMD base instead. The force of the explosion caused the base to fill with water drowning almost all of the personnel on the base. Killian survived the blast. In this time Aspen was saved by the very pilot who blew up the base. When she had recovered, she went out one morning to buy bagels, she was drugged and kidnapped by what looked to be government agents. They turn her over to Killian’s troops. Cannon Hawke went in pursuit and managed to take one of the men captive. He takes the man with him for interrogation, to find out where they’ve taken aspen, the base of Killian. But this place was protected by the best guards Killian had, he couldn’t risk his own life because no-one would be there to take his place in this time of need. So he decided to wait, hoping he could undo whatever Killian was doing to her at a later point in time. Here Killian ‘brainwashed’ her and asked her for her help which she willingly gave and even killed for him. They retrieved and set up Apparatus installations around the world to power a weapon of tremendous potential in covering the earth with water to eliminate the human threat.</p><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177665\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177665-31578-aspen.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5425\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177665-31578-aspen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177665\"><img alt=\"Aspen about to kill Killian\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177665-31578-aspen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177665-31578-aspen.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177665-31578-aspen.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Aspen about to kill Killian\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177665-31578-aspen.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/177665-31578-aspen.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/177665-31578-aspen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Aspen about to kill Killian</figcaption></figure><p>As they were about to start the last one up Cannon appeared with his team in an attempt to stop her and talk sense into her. Kyla (a friend of in Killian’s team) then revealed that she was working for Cannon undercover and a battle ensues. After they were safe Cannon then reveals her past, he tells that she was well loved as a child of the Blue, and that her parents were well respected. He reveals that she had a brother, and when she was eleven years old, she and her brother were swimming outside their parent’s place when an attack happened. Her parents were killed and Cannon was rendered useless. The perpetrator was Killian and his Dissidents. She then realized her mistake and went with Cannon to stop Killian. Killian had already started the Blue Sun and an energy beam was blasting from a station in space towards the earth. Cannon and his team quickly reached their destination and told them this would have catastrophic consequences if this were to continue. Cannon tried to stop Killian but got blasted by Killian, this did not stop Cannon and he continued the fight with Taras, Killian’s subordinate. After a short fight Cannon managed to overpower and kill him by throwing him into the blue energy beam.</p><p>He then attempted to fight with Killian, but Killian was stronger and defeated him easily. He got the upper hand and threw Aspen into the blue energy beam. This enraged Cannon even more and caused him to attack Killian once more but he was quickly overpowered. Just a Killian was about to kill Cannon, Aspen emerged from the energy beam in a mixture of energy and water. She easily killed Killian by taking him into the energy beam with this newfound power and told Cannon to run while she took care of the Blue Sun. Aspen destroyed the apparatus and a moment later she emerged from the water looking completely normal.</p><h2>Back From the Dead</h2><p>Killian didn't really died from Aspen during the Blue Sun, his body was trapped in water form just like Aspen's brother, <a href=\"/finn/4005-41313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41313\">Finn</a>. He uses this form as a disguise of Finn to team up with Aspen to defeat Admiral Maylander and his goons in a war between the Blue and the humans.

That includes hydro-kinesis, the ability to love under and above the water. But he can also fire powerful blasts, turn his complete body into water and even has a rapid healing factor.

    "description": "<h2><b>Origin</b></h2><h3>Early Life</h3><p>When Kiani was a child, she thought her parents were killed in the destruction of the underwater city, Marielle. Orphaned, <a href=\"/casque/4005-41451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41451\">Casque</a> took her under his wing and raised her as a warrior. Teaching her how to use her blue talents at their fullest potential.</p><h3>Dawn of War</h3><p>Casque and some <a href=\"/blue/4060-41253/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41253\">Blue</a> trainees would be captured by Admiral <a href=\"/james-maylander/4005-46345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46345\">Maylander</a> while they were training at Shepherd’s Field. Once Kiani discovered the news, she would attempt to find Casque, however, the Blue council did not allow her to form a rescue mission. They feared that rescuing Casque and the others would expose the Blue race. However, after one of their own council members, <a href=\"/marqueses/4005-48802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48802\">Marqueses</a>, disappeared, they order Kiani to search for him. They also allowed her to search for Casque at the same time, however, Marqueses is the main priority.

Kiani eventually stumbles across a security video that shows Casque and the trainees being taken somewhere. Meanwhile, Siphon and Brande were investigating the other rooms when someone drives a vehicle through the window, causing water to engulf the house quickly. The water reaches to Kiani quickly, and unlike the Elite Blue, she cannot change her body into water. However, she uses the ability she learned from Casque to phase through the water so it doesn’t knock her out. Kiani rushes over to where Siphon and Brande were supposed to be, only to see them being carried away by a mysterious group. She dashes towards them quickly and frees Siphon and Brande to even the odds. After defeating a couple of them, Kiani engages against a woman wielding two swords. However, their fight stops quickly when Brande was held with a knife next to his throat. Kiani is forced to surrender and they were taken prisoners willingly.</p><p>Back at their base of operations, Kiani exchanges a few harsh words with one of the goons she defeated. They are interrupted by Marqueses, who tells them that he sent those people to detain them. Marqueses then fills Kiani and the others in on the reason for his disappearance. He had been planning to rescue Casque from Maylander for awhile, and did not want to ask the council for anything. He tells Kiani that he wants to free his brethrens from captivity, and for her to be prepared to go to war if she agrees. Kiani, Brande, and Siphon discuss their plan at a waterfall nearby. She tells them that she does not trust Marqueses and that they should inform <a href=\"/cannon-hawke/4005-41254/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41254\">Cannon</a>. Siphon tells Kiani that he can use their computer and send a message with the location to Cannon. After they successfully send the message to Cannon, Kiani meets up with Marqueses out on the field. She tells Marqueses that she is willing to ally herself with him to help Casque.</p><p>The next day, they headed for Maylander’s secret base where Casque was being held captive. They blow off most of the top of the base and quickly eliminated any threat in their way. Kiani opens a room where the trainees where being held in tubes. Horrified at what the humans have done to them, she orders the others to free the trainees and take them to the ship. Kiani heads to the room where Casque was being held captive. Marqueses was at the control station opening Casque’s prison. Kiani catches Casque, but was knocked away by Rox. Kiani is forced to engage against Rox while Marqueses takes Casque away with him. However, Kiani makes quick work of Rox when she cuts off his legs then stabs him to death. Talia was standing behind her ready for their second round. The two begin fighting, but Talia is quickly overmatched by Kiani. Marqueses then successfully blows up the entire base, Kiani was able to escape from the wreckage, but she and the others were left stranded. Cannon would eventually arrives to pick them up. However, Kiani takes the jet inside their ship and flies to where Marqueses has taken Casque. Meanwhile, Marqueses reveals that Casque is a black, and is angered that he would not stand by his side and use his power to help the people of the Blue.</p><figure style=\"width: 1990px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2364935\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364935-fathom___dawn_of_war__03_image_12_13.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.73517587939698\" data-width=\"1990\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364935-fathom___dawn_of_war__03_image_12_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2364935\"><img alt=\"Heated Battle\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364935-fathom___dawn_of_war__03_image_12_13.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364935-fathom___dawn_of_war__03_image_12_13.jpg 1990w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83676/2364935-fathom___dawn_of_war__03_image_12_13.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83676/2364935-fathom___dawn_of_war__03_image_12_13.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364935-fathom___dawn_of_war__03_image_12_13.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Heated Battle</figcaption></figure><p>Marqueses would be interrupted when the lights were cut.

However, she loses him for a second, and Marqueses was almost able to get a sneak attack off on her, their battle continues over to the edge of a cliff. Kiani and Marqueses charges each other for the final blow, but it is Kiani who is stabbed on her right shoulder, and falls off the cliff. She was seriously wounded and was fighting to stay awake.

He then uses his Black powers to heal Kiani. Marqueses then confronts the two, demanding to use Casque’s powers. However, Casque became angered at what Marqueses had done, and so he used his Black powers to destroy Marqueses. Right afterwards, a large group of Blacks emerged from the sea. Casque is forced to return home with his brethrens. Kiani is crushed that Casque left her, and begins thinking about what Maylander will do to retaliate.</p><h3>War against the Humans</h3><p>Kiani and the others are now back at Dor, the Capital City of the Blues. While the trainees who were captured by Maylander were training to walk again, Kiani was also training to get stronger. She was angered that she had to lose Casque on three separate occasions. It was motivation for her to train and become as strong as she could. Meanwhile, Cannon receives a message from the city Saba, alerting him that they are under attack by the humans. Cannon became outraged when others did not want to go to Saba to rescue those in need because of their orders. Cannon was prepared to go alone, but he would not as Kiani, Siphon, and Brande are ready to join him. The four of them take a ship and headed for a whirlpool called the Hydroport that would transport them to Saba. They encounter a human ship while heading for the whirlpool, and once they were finally able to go through, they discover Saba in ruins. They are forced into a battle against the humans, but are overmatched by them. <a href=\"/thalassar/4005-48800/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48800\">Thalassar</a> would arrive and save the four of them, they were finally able to hide with whatever remaining survivors were left. Cannon tells Thalassar that they did not come to save the city, but to save him and his people. They all get on the ship that Cannon brought and Kiani has to maneuver the ship through the Hydroport, while Cannon holds off the humans. Kiani was successful in bringing the ship and the people back to the city Muria. Shortly afterwards, the guards had just arrested Cannon for disobeying orders and going to Saba. Cannon was in trial as Thalassar tried to defend Cannon. Kiani became angered that the council would arrest Cannon for saving their own people. Luckily, Thalassar stopped Kiani before she got herself arrested.</p><figure style=\"width: 1152px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2370967\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.78732638888889\" data-width=\"1152\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2370967\"><img alt=\"Kiani, along with Brande and Siphon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg 1152w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kiani, along with Brande and Siphon\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg 1152w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2370967-blz05.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kiani, along with Brande and Siphon</figcaption></figure><p>Later, Kiani heads over to Cannon’s prison only to find a guard beaten badly as Cannon escaped. Meanwhile, Maylander and his army has just discovered the Hydroport and are about to head to Dor. While Kiani was forced to follow orders and stay around Muria, the council is doing nothing about the human’s attack, but they would rather find and arrest Cannon for what he has done. The humans are moving in quickly, their weapons are outmatching the Blues easily. While Thalassar was trying to argue with the council, Kiani was sitting by herself outside. As Brande approached Kiani, she realizes that the humans have just arrived. She engages against the humans, and at first had the upper hand. However, Kiani underestimated the human’s technology, and she was shot by an electrical wire. Kiani was electrocuted, and as she screamed in pain her body began turning into water. Cannon had just returned and informed the council members that <a href=\"/taras/4005-41492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41492\">Taras</a> lives on in him, and he has been keeping Taras in check for a long time. They then tell Cannon about what had happened to Kiani. Kiani was still unconscious and they discovered that she was an Elite Blue, no one had ever known of her true potential. Her parents had died so young that there was no knowledge about her heritage, even Casque didn’t know for sure if Kiani was an Elite Blue. While Cannon and the others went on a mission, Kiani was able to wake up. A few days later, Cannon and the others return from their mission. They headed to the infirmary where Kiani was, to discover that she was not there. Kiani was training in a room by herself, she remembered when Casque told her that she was unique and special, and that she had an unusual connection to the water. She used to believe that he told that to all his students, but after what had happened to her, she knows what he meant now.</p><p>Kiani fell asleep in her tub and begins having nightmares that she dissolves into water completely. After she wakes up, she begins questioning her past until a woman approaches her. The woman tells Kiani that she is a hero and that she looks up to her for strength and courage. They continue on with their deep conversation and she introduces herself to Kiani as <a href=\"/anya/4005-46346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46346\">Anya</a>. Later, Kiani tries to learn to control her new abilities more. Kiani and the others begin to gear up to battle the humans. They finally head into battle against the humans at Dor. Kiani was controlling a ship, then the humans locked on to her. They blew up her ship but she was able to abandon it easily with her new powers. Kiani then tests out her new powers on a human ship and blew it away. The battle continues from Dor to Muria, where <a href=\"/aspen-matthews/4005-41245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41245\">Aspen Matthews</a> finally meets up with Cannon and the others. Kiani then joins the battle with them as she wields her new abilities against the humans. Maylander finally arrives with his huge ships, he then drops explosives down towards Kiani, Aspen, <a href=\"/finn/4005-41313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41313\">Finn</a> (Aspen’s brother) and Cannon. Aspen becomes angered by Maylander and she begins unleashing her more of her power, knocking them out of the sea. Meanwhile, Kiani was destroying the army’s jets and not allowing them to get airborne. She jumps on the carriers and continues destroying more jets to disable the humans. After Cannon was hit by a missile, Aspen was forced to unleash all of her powers and destroyed all human ships. Aspen ended the war against the humans, and the Blues begin reconstruction on their city.</p><h3>First Volume of Fathom: Kiani</h3><figure style=\"width: 1280px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2364703\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.01171875\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2364703\"><img alt=\"Training\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg 1280w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg 632w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Training\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg 1280w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364703-blz09.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Training</figcaption></figure><p>The war left many dead Blue soldiers, eventually a rescue team would be sent to pick up Kiani and any survivors. Back at the city, Siphon informs Kiani about the death of Brande. It is the aftermath of the war and Kiani is quietly mourning the death of Brande, who was killed in an explosion while trying to disarm a bomb the humans planted. While Kiani was in the hall where Brande’s statue was built, she begins to reminisce through her memories about the time when Casque trained her, Brande, and Siphon. While they were training on the surface, they see a light that was caused by <a href=\"/killian/4005-41255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41255\">Killian</a>. However, Casque tells Kiani not to let it distract her and they continue their training. Kiani and Brande spar for a bit, but they were distracted by another beam of light. Soon after, Anya approaches Kiani in the hall and talks to her about her uncontrollable powers. Anya then begins talking about Kiani’s parents, but she stops her mid-way as Kiani became angered at Anya for dishonoring her parents with some rumor. Anya becomes impatient and tells her that she resembles too much like her father. Kiani finally realizes that the rumors are true, Anya and Killian are her parents.</p><figure style=\"width: 1280px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2364702\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.21015625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2364702\"><img alt=\"The Truth?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg 1280w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg 793w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Truth?\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg 1280w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg 793w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83676/2364702-blz22.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Truth?</figcaption></figure><p>Anya then explains to Kiani that she and Killian were forced to give Kiani to Casque, in hopes for Kiani to have a better life. Killian and Anya were already fugitives. Anya then tells Kiani that the reason she revealed this is because only Kiani has the power to retrieve the remains of Killian. At first Kiani did not want to have anything to do with them, however, after spending some time alone she eventually decides to go after her father's remains. Kiani has to search for the Aescylot City, she meets up with Masacas, who knows where the city is located. Masacas takes Kiani to uncharted water and brings her to an area with the Hydroport that would lead her to the city. However, the Hydroport was hidden amongst thousands of false ports (false ports destroys any being that enters it), and only Kiani has the power to destroy all the false ports with a thought. Kiani unleashes her powers and reveals the real Hydroport, to which Kiani enters it alone.</p><p>Kiani arrives at an isolated colony of the Blue, who believes Kiani to be Kira, a destined savior from an upcoming threat. Kiani denies their claims, but her effort is ignored.

She survived Aspen's attack due to a healing power that she was told to keep secret by mentor, Casque. In a secret meeting between Siphon, a Blue and Casque, a Black discuss that Kiani will be a great threat now that the Blue has agreed to make peace with the humans. At this point it is apparent that only they and possibly Kiani know the secret behind Kiani's origins and the source of her new found powers.</p><p>As predicted by Siphon and Casque, Kiani single handily attacks a small fleet of Blue watercraft that was dispatched to protect a visiting a human peace keeping craft. After she is destroying every craft and killing both human and Blue, it is reviled that Kiani has group followers. It turns out Kiani is using the abandon city of Marielle as her base of operations to build her human resistance group, but it wasn't long until her father, Killian, who's now Commander of the Elite Guard for the Blue sent her in imprisonment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Sisters</h3><p>After the events of the Elite Saga, Kiani was consumed with guilt and goes into self-imposed exile. While out in the surface, Kiani met a Russian scientist named Luzhin, but later turns out that he's also a Blue who has been working with the humans. He tells her that he knows where Kiani's sister, <a href=\"/anika/4005-95979/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-95979\">Anika</a> is and Kiani wants to get there to see her. However Luzhin and the other scientists wants to test Kiani's fighting skills and powers in a facility called the Volna and they took a sample of her blood. Kiani knows they can't be trusted and she attacks them. Luzhin's soldiers chased her, but she was aided with a help of Casque. Kiani and Luzhin battle each other and she killed him. Two months later, Kiani travels to the Republic of Botswana and she finally found her sister, Anika along with a new gang of Blue.</p><figure style=\"width: 638px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4459952\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11116/111167641/4459952-kiani_and_anika.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2100313479624\" data-width=\"638\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11116/111167641/4459952-kiani_and_anika.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4459952\"><img alt=\"Kiani and her sister, Anika\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" data-width=\"528\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11116/111167641/4459952-kiani_and_anika.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11116/111167641/4459952-kiani_and_anika.jpg 638w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11116/111167641/4459952-kiani_and_anika.jpg 528w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kiani and her sister, Anika\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11116/111167641/4459952-kiani_and_anika.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11116/111167641/4459952-kiani_and_anika.jpg 638w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11116/111167641/4459952-kiani_and_anika.jpg 528w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" data-width=\"528\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kiani and her sister, Anika</figcaption></figure><p>Kiani and Anika are reunited together to face a human admiral named Hoover, along with his men who tries to attack the sisters that are now making peace with the humans in Mogadishu. Kiani threatens Hoover and told him next time he attacks, her and Anika will come after him. Hoover wasn't finish with them so he sent a genetically-modified human-Blue hybrid monster covered in gray ooze-like matter to destroy the sisters. The monster shot Kiani's arm with the matter causing pain and Anika tries to defeat the fiend, but it overwhelms her with it's matter. The sisters were saved by Shalla Barnic, a weapon dealer who has history with Cannon Hawke. Shalla gave Kiani and Anika a couple of special tech armors to defeat Hoover and his monsters. The sisters manage to kill them and Anika, who refuses to listen to Kiani not to kill Hoover did it just that, but danger from Hoover's last words leads Kiani and Anika back to Shalla and notice he sold them out. The sisters confronts Shalla, but he told them Admiral Maylander was the one that tries to destroy them. While a helicopter here to pick up Kiani and Anika, they spared Shalla's life and head to Maylander's secret location which seems to be an oil plant. Inside the plant has prisoners of Blue that were controlled by Maylander. The sisters confront Maylander and his soldiers after Anika killed a ferocious prisoner Blue. Anika looks forward to kill Maylander, but he warned her things will get worse for her, Kiani and the Blue if she does kill him. Kiani tries to prevent Anika from letting it happen, but recklessly she refuses to listen to her and about to finish Maylander off. Kiani has no choice but to put her sister down with her water blade ability by stabbing her. Kiani was sorry she had to do it to stop her and Anika last words to her says, \"I trust you\" before dissolving into water. Kiani may have saved Maylander's life, but she warned him no more deaths and no one can control the Blue. Maylander let her go and she swims off thinking she and the Blue must be wiser to the humans and think long term. At the bottom of the plant, Anika in water form appears that she survived from the kill by Kiani and one day will see her sister again.</p><h2><b>Powers and Abilities</b></h2><h3>Water Control</h3><p>At first, Kiani does not have the ability to control water. She learned an ability from Casque that allows her to phase through water so it does not crush her. During <a href=\"/michael-turners-fathom/4050-18086/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18086\">Fathom volume 2</a> issue 5, Kiani's hidden abilities were activated when Maylander's army electrocuted her. Kiani now has the ability to manipulate water at her own will.</p><h3>Healing</h3><p>In a battle with Aspen Matthews, Kiani's body was pulled apart by a vortex that Aspen opened. Believed to be dead, Kiani actually has the power to regenerate herself and quickly heal severe wounds to her body.</p><h3>Swordsmanship</h3><p>Kiani learned to wield a sword from Casque. She is a very good swordsman and wields a blue water blade. Her sword's blade can sheath itself by disappearing, and reforms at her will.</p>",

Led by the immortal Contessa, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\" href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" slug=\"lex-luthor\">Lex Luthor's</a> estranged wife, the Agenda first made their presence known when they captured <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\" href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" slug=\"superboy\">Superboy</a> and cloned Match from samples of Superboy's DNA.</p><p>Cunning, methodical and highly intelligent, Match possessed the raw knowledge and tactical training that Superboy lacked - a result of Match's more complete gestation process. Seeing Match as his genetic \"brother\", Superboy pleaded with the teen powerhouse - but Match's near-absolute loyalty to the Agenda blinded him to reason. Possessing more raw power and skill than Superboy, Match nearly defeated his genetic twin during their first encounter before Match was apparently buried in the Agenda's original underground facility.</p><p>Later, as part of the Agenda's massive campaign against the youth heroes, Match infiltrated <a data-ref-id=\"4060-17733\" href=\"/young-justice/4060-17733/\" slug=\"young-justice\">Young Justice</a> disguised as Superboy. He nearly succeeded in his efforts to drive a wedge between the team members before his ruse was exposed by the return of the real Kid of Steel.

Deathstroke had his own agenda, which was to reclaim his children, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12890\" href=\"/ravager/4005-12890/\" slug=\"ravager\">Ravager</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9949\" href=\"/jericho/4005-9949/\" slug=\"jericho\">Jericho</a>. Titans East was nearly successful in that mission, until Nightwing, Flash, Troia and Beast Boy helped turn the tide and reclaim their island headquarters. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10885\" href=\"/wonder-girl/4005-10885/\" slug=\"wonder-girl\">Wonder Girl</a> was heartbroken while battling a clone of her deceased boyfriend, leaving Jericho to possess Match's body. The members of Titans East dispersed, unaware of Deathstroke's true objective; By cementing his offspring as trusted members of the team, Slade knew the Titans would provide his children with a better family than he ever could.</p><h2>Wonder Girl</h2><p>Although his mind and body have shown obvious signs of change, one part of Match that is still identical to his genetic twin is his emotional attachment to Wonder Girl. Match has attempted to reach out to her on several occasions, trying to mimic the relationship she and Connor shared. However, his advances are always turned down, as Wonder Girl is simply unable to feel what she felt for Conner with his monster of a clone.</p><h2>Titans</h2><p>In issue #7 of TITANS, Jericho (still inhabiting Match's body) came to the veteran Titans in a panic. He told them that he could not escape Match's body, and that he was loosing control. But before issues end it was discovered that Match was still very much a prisoner in his own body, and Jericho had once again gone rouge. Jericho escaped from Match's body and into one of the other Titans. One has to wonder if Match will return to his old ways, or attempt to play a more heroic role in the DCU</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Like Superboy, Match's primary power is a limited form of telekinesis that mimics super-strength and flight. He is also able to disassemble objects with a touch. Later, Superboy manifested a certain amount of non-psychically derived super-strength. Superboy later developed heat vision, X-Ray vision and super-hearing, similar to his mentor's abilities.</p><p>Match possesses all the powers of Superboy, with even greater skill at mastering them.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p>Match appears in the Young Justice episode Agendas, where he is the first attempt by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47233\" href=\"/project-cadmus/4060-47233/\" slug=\"project-cadmus\">Project Cadmus</a> in cloning <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a>. However due to being cloned from pure Kryptonian DNA, he was half crazed and flew into a rage at the sight of the Superman symbol and placed in cryogenic storage for the world's safety. However Superboy acting on a tip from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\" href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" slug=\"lex-luthor\">Lex Luthor</a> freed him, and upon Match seeing the symbol on his chest savagely beat him and Wolf and disappeared to Genome City, following using his heat vision to carve a backward S onto his chest. He was ultimately defeated by Superboy utilizing the shields given to him by Luthor to unlock his full Kryptonian abilities,and was placed by into cryogenic storage for safety concerns.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110132/2578613-mt.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578613\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110132/2578613-mt.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578613\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110132/2578613-mt.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110132/2578613-mt.jpeg 240w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110132/2578613-mt.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/110132/2578613-mt.jpeg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></noscript></a></figure>",

To that end, Sungirl wanted to kill Miss Martian before that future would come to pass. Joining Titans East would help achieve that goal.

Believing their murders to the be the work of Satan he vowed to fight evil at any cost. Some time later <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40528\" href=\"/kid-devil/4005-40528/\" slug=\"kid-devil\">  Kid Devil</a> showed up at his sunday school seeking help. Upon seeing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40528\" href=\"/kid-devil/4005-40528/\" slug=\"kid-devil\">  Kid Devil</a>'s demonic appearance Kid Crusader felt that he had to \"save\" him. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3588\" href=\"/deathstroke/4005-3588/\" slug=\"deathstroke\">  Deathstroke</a> recruited him for <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41257\" href=\"/titans-east/4060-41257/\" slug=\"titans-east\">  Titans East</a> solely to battle <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40528\" href=\"/kid-devil/4005-40528/\" slug=\"kid-devil\">  Kid Devil</a>.

Now under demonic control, Kid Crusader still sought to destroy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40528\" href=\"/kid-devil/4005-40528/\" slug=\"kid-devil\">  Kid Devil</a> because he believed he would go to hell &amp; never see his parents again. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3584\" href=\"/raven/4005-3584/\" slug=\"raven\">  Raven</a> was able to transfer the demon's essence back into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40528\" href=\"/kid-devil/4005-40528/\" slug=\"kid-devil\">  Kid Devil</a>. </p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Powers</h2><p>Kid Crusader does not appear to have any \"super\" powers. He wields a cross that can shoot electricity as well as a number of other demon hunting weapons. Kid Crusader has a considerable knowledge of arcane magic, particularly in the field of exorcism. </p><p><br/> </p>",

They possess a high degree of telepathy, able to use it in limited offensive capabilities such as and can open inter-dimensional gateways into alternate planes of existence. As revealed in a flashback in <a href=\"/generation-x/4050-5300/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5300\">Generation X</a> #40, the twins opened a doorway to another dimension to imprison their villainous brother <a href=\"http://comicvine.com/emplate/29-10579/\">Emplate</a> as a punishment for his suspected (later discovered to be actual) involvement in their mother's death and their sister <a href=\"http://comicvine.com/m/29-40460/\">M</a>'s disappearance.</p><p>Nicole and Claudette also possess a rare power called \"gestalt.\" With it, they can (and have) physically merged with with Marius (Emplate), Monet (M), <a href=\"http://comicvine.com/hollow/29-10573/\">Hollow</a> or any combination thereof. Each combination has a new, different personality and set of powers. A simple example of a gestalt: When they were masquerading as their older sister Monet, they possessed many abilities, not all of which may have actually existed in the real Monet.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The M Twins, Claudette and Nicole, first appeared, posing as their older sister Monet, in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-uncanny-x-men-316-generation-next-part-1-encou/4000-39680/\">Uncanny X-Men issue 316</a> (1994). It was only revealed later that this Monet was actually the twin girls that had morped into Monet. The twin's first appearance as themselves was in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/generation-x-31-rites-of-passage/4000-83096/\">Generation X issue 31</a> (1997).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Phalanx</h3><p>During the <a href=\"/phalanx-covenant/4045-42176/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42176\">Phalanx</a> Arc, The M-twins are in a limousine. With a colonel who is complaining about Monet not talking. She tells her if she say anything her dad might send her to get help from <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Xavier</a> in the states who deal with mutants. The car then turns off and nothing in the car works. It crashes against a rail. In front of the car is a <a href=\"/phalanx/4005-9651/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9651\">phalanx</a> who absorbs the driver. It goes to the back of the car to get Monet, the Colonel throws Monet out of the car and tells her to run for her life. She then shoots the phalanx to no result only to be absorbed by it. Monet just stays in the same place. The phalanx tries to make a biocentric scan of Monet but he says there is too much intense psionic energy blocking him from doing it. The phalanx then states that the being might be the most powerful of the next generation of homo superior. Monet is then seen in a chamber with <a href=\"/skin/4005-10566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10566\">Skin</a>, <a href=\"/husk/4005-3426/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3426\">Paige</a>, <a href=\"/cannonball/4005-1496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\">Cannonball</a> and <a href=\"/blink/4005-12548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12548\">Blink</a>. They still make no contact with the other people. She then tells them to be quiet. Monet is was making a device that would get them out this device showed that Cannonball was part of the phalanx. The phalanx then turns to stone. Monet already knew Cannonball was a phalanx. And tells the others there are few things she doesn’t know. She then tells them that the phalanx placed him in here as a spy. She then tells them the device she made also put a illusion to the other phalanx that they are still in the room while they escape.</p><h3>Generation X</h3><p><b>(When saying M or Monet, it is the M-Twins as Monet)</b></p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/688109-twins10.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/688109-twins10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"The Secret is Out\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/688109-twins10.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Secret is Out</figcaption></figure><p>During Generation X the Twins were masquerading as <a href=\"/m/4005-40460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40460\">Monet</a> and nobody knew. M-Twins first appeared as the kids were being gathered together to go to school. She makes a comment on how mutants shouldn't hide their abilities and should be proud of them. When she comes in she asks <a href=\"/banshee/4005-9708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9708\">Sean Cassidy</a> to get her bags, he says yes to three trucks full of bags. They are the first ones who want to go to the training session. M-Twins like to climb trees even though they can fly. In the first issue we see them talking to <a href=\"/gateway/4005-4646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4646\">Gateway</a>. They then figure he came here to tell them <a href=\"/emplate/4005-10579/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10579\">Marius</a>, their brother, is back. They go to the airport to get <a href=\"/decibel/4005-2244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2244\">Chamber</a> when he is attacked by Emplate. The M-Twins go to attack him but is held telepathically by <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a>. M-Twins didn't like it that much and yelled at Emma never to try that again.</p><p>Upon finding <a href=\"/hollow/4005-10573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10573\">Hollow</a> on the school grounds Monet explains to Emma and Banshee how many similarities Hollow and Emplate have. She then goes on to say Emplate must of been feeding on Hollow. Monet goes with Emma to find Hollow she knocks down trees to make it easier for Emma but Emma doesn't appreciate it so Monet flies off. She then comes back and save Emma and tells her she doesn't like how Emma goes into peoples heads and what she wear.</p><p>When <a href=\"/jubilee/4005-4562/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4562\">Jubilee</a>, Skin, <a href=\"/synch/4005-10576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10576\">Synch</a>, Banshee and Monet went to Canada they ran into some problems. The security guard told them that there was a problem with a bridge there, so they would have to take a different route. Monet tells them that before they came there she studied the topography charts and that there is no bridge. They travel down the road some more to find out a mutant is holding up students in a school. Monet with the order from Banshee takes out some guards without the others noticing with the help of Skin. The <a href=\"/orphan-maker/4005-25911/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25911\">Orphan Maker</a> comes and Banshee fights it with the help of Monet. This is when Banshee figures out that Monet is actually stronger than she appears or that he thinks. Monet recognizes him from the X-Factor files, and tells it she doesn't want to hurt him. The Maker then throws Monet into a car.</p><p>When the students are allowed to go into the city Emma is kidnapped by an alternate version of <a href=\"/marrow/4005-13726/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13726\">Marrow</a> and <a href=\"/caliban/4005-9637/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9637\">Caliban</a>. When Generation X go to save her Monet is in a trance and cant be moved, so the rest leave her. She then comes back to save Jubilee from dying from rocks of the sewer falling on her. From Chamber's powers he accidentally blew up the girls dorms. Monet roommate was Jubilee. Jubilee woke up in the middle of the night and found Monet reading in the dark. She asks her what is she reading and Monet doesn't show her. It comes to a little tussle and Jubilee pulling too hard rips the pages and fall. Jubilee then finds out Monet was coloring. Monet then goes and talks to Gateway, asking how much longer do she need to be around these children and she then just levitates with him.</p><p>Monet goes with the rest of the group to Cassidy Keep after Cassidy had a dream about it. They are transported to a magical realm where it lacks oxygen Monet being the first to know this. She then fixes the machine that is broken but needs a energy source and Chamber powers it.</p><p>Monet goes to the party with the rest of Generation X, she goes with Synch. Monet tells Synch she is going to go and check on Sean, when she gets their she sees him passed out so she telepathically talk to Emma who is surprised not knowing Monet had telepathy. She then flies him to the medical room.</p><p>The real Monet, as some in Generation X have noted, is actually even more obnoxious than the twins when they were impersonating Monet.

    "deck": "Cousin to Heather Douglas, Pamela Douglas developed her latent psionic potential when Heather's consciousness reached out to her for help.",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2><h3>Origin</h3>A few years ago, the arrogant psionic known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\" href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" slug=\"moondragon\">Moondragon</a> came under the influence of the evil being known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56928\" href=\"/dragon-of-the-moon/4005-56928/\" slug=\"dragon-of-the-moon\">Dragon of the Moon</a>. She attacked her fellow <a data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\" href=\"/defenders/4060-26333/\" slug=\"defenders\">Defenders</a>, who defeated her at the cost of the lives of several members. Moondragon's body turned into a statue which then crumbled into dust. Moondragon's soul, though shattered, somehow survived and was set adrift. Her soul finally found sanctuary in the mind of her closest living relative, her cousin, Pamela Douglas. After Moondragon’s body was destroyed the computer called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22002\" href=\"/isaac/4005-22002/\" slug=\"isaac\">ISAAC</a>, who helps run the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\" href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" slug=\"eternals\">Earth Eternal</a> colony on <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41735\" href=\"/titans/4060-41735/\" slug=\"titans\">Titan</a>, a moon of Jupiter, began creating a clone of Moondragon.<br/><br/>The weakened soul of Moondragon then began to contact her host, Pamela. At first Pamela thought she was going mad. Pamela Douglas suddenly found herself suffering from unexplained outbursts, as she scribbled \"hate them\" repeatedly on notepads, and flew into fits of anger for no apparent reason. She also began to fear that her boyfriend Tom didn't love her because she was going mad. One night, she went into the washroom and shaved off all of her hair. After this, she was placed under the care of a doctor, who advised her to take a vacation, believing her to be suffering from stress. However, when she saw a billboard of a fetus while driving her car, she crashed it.  <br/><br/>Pamela was now convinced that her irrational behavior was a result of her being pregnant, but the doctor's tests came back negative. Her paranoia continued, until one night she was attacked in her apartment by two clawed hands and a man wearing a mystic crystal. She ran from the building into the street where Heather Douglas contacted her telepathically. Heather explained to Pamela that she had been the super-hero Moondragon, until the influence of the Dragon of the Moon corrupted her, and her body was destroyed battling the Defenders. The Eternals of Titan had cloned a new body for Heather on Titan, but Heather's soul had hidden itself within Pamela. Heather was now conscious enough to speak with Pamela, and directed her to enter her ship, Sensia II, which would bring her to Titan.<br/><br/>However, the entity responsible for the attack on Pamela returned, and proved to be <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7114\" href=\"/gargoyle/4005-7114/\" slug=\"gargoyle\">Isaac Christians</a>. Known as the Gargoyle, Isaac had been one of the Defenders seemingly killed when the corrupted Moondragon was defeated. Heather, through Pamela, was able to calm down Isaac Christians's soul and make amends. Isaac's soul now existed in a red crystal that he had once picked up in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\" href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" slug=\"doctor-strange\">Doctor Strange</a>'s house.  Pamela placed the necklace with the crystal around her neck.  Heather, speaking through Pamela, convinced Isaac to come with them to Titan, in the hopes that they could find a new life for him as well. He agreed, and the three departed for Titan.  <br/><br/><h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838481-sundragon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838481\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.2222222222222\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:222.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838481-sundragon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838481\"><img alt=\"Pamela and the Infant Heather\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838481-sundragon2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838481-sundragon2.jpg 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\"></a><figcaption>Pamela and the Infant Heather</figcaption></figure>Time on Titan</h3>Moondragon's personal spacecraft then arrived to whisk all three away to the Titan moon. The Eternals made Pamela feel welcome there, while they waited for Moondragon's clone to reach gestation. Pamela enjoyed herself on Titan, often playing trivia games with their computer ISAAC, and games of chess with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14522\" href=\"/mentor/4005-14522/\" slug=\"mentor\">Mentor</a>. She also learned more about Heather from her as her new body continued to grow.  Pamela was attracted to the Eternal <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41749\" href=\"/demeityr/4005-41749/\" slug=\"demeityr\">Demeityr</a>, but Heather didn't approve of their relationship from the start.<br/><br/>When gestation day arrived, Moondragon and Pamela discovered that once the baby clone was imprinted with Moondragon's soul, the baby would be given to the care of the <span>Priests of Shao-Lom</span> and Pamela would be returned to Earth. Both Pamela and Moondragon violently objected to these terms. At first, it looked as if they would have to give in to the powerful Eternal leader, Mentor. Then Isaac Christians's soul spoke up and asked Mentor to remand the two women into his care. Mentor had come to know and respect Isaac Christians, so he agreed.<br/><br/><h3>Exploring the Galaxy<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/152446-156114-sundragon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-152446\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.7811704834606\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:178.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/152446-156114-sundragon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-152446\"><img alt=\"Becoming Sundragon\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/152446-156114-sundragon.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/152446-156114-sundragon.jpg 393w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px\" data-width=\"393\"></a><figcaption>Becoming Sundragon</figcaption></figure></h3>Pamela, the cloned infant of Moondragon, and the soul of Isaac Christians then started on a tour of the galaxy in Moondragon's spaceship. As they set off into space, they were trapped in the tractor beam of a vessel operated by the Dance. Moondragon told Pamela that the powerful race moved through the universe and performed a variety of seemingly random acts.   <br/><br/>Pamela found herself and Heather manipulated by <span>the Dance</span> in an attempt to use them in their bizarre experiments. The Dance members started forcing Pamela and the others into a column of fusion-level plasma. With Heather's prodding, Pamela was able to access her own innate psychic powers, and set them free. Not only did they teleport themselves out of the plasma column, but they also teleported Demeityr to the Dance ship. The Dance then let them go free, apparently done with them.<br/><br/>Demeityr joined their little tour and they left for parts unknown. As the months went by, Moondragon's cloned body matured at an accelerated rate, but not fast enough to suit her. Pamela, Heather, Isaac Christians and Demeityr met with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42846\" href=\"/cloud/4005-42846/\" slug=\"cloud\">Cloud</a>, who had also been a Defender.  The reunion went sour when Moondragon erupted in a fit of rage over being trapped in her still-growing new body.<br/><br/>Moondragon became angered by the intimacy Pamela and Demeityr shared. As Pamela and Demeityr set off to their quarters, Moondragon attacked them psychically, and tried to take Demeityr away from Pamela.  She mentally assaulted them and then forced her body into complete maturity.  When Pamela, Isaac, and Demeityr confronted her, Moondragon cast all three of them out of the ship, to die in the vacuum of space. <br/><br/><h3>Becoming Sundragon<figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838482-sundragon3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838482\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1627906976744\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838482-sundragon3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838482\"><img alt=\"Sundragon and her steed\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" data-width=\"344\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838482-sundragon3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838482-sundragon3.jpg 344w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sundragon and her steed\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838482-sundragon3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38315/838482-sundragon3.jpg 344w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" data-width=\"344\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sundragon and her steed</figcaption></figure></h3>Pamela fell into a sun, but luckily, a nearby star held part of the consciousness of the living nebulae, Cloud. Cloud saved them and then used her powers to activate the rest of Pamela's dormant powers, and to give her a new form.  Cloud also formed a body out of stellar matter for Isaac's soul to inhabit. Cloud then created a dragon out of stellar mass, that Pamela could control and use as a form of travel. Pamela adopted the new identity of Sundragon, having taken the power of a sun.<br/><br/>They then confronted Moondragon, who confessed that she felt as if no one really cared for her, and that everyone loved Pamela. Pamela and the others forgave Moondragon and told her that they loved her. Touched by their love, Moondragon realized her error of her ways and promised not to make the same mistakes again. The three of them forgave Moondragon, then set off to explore space together.<br/><br/>Sundragon, Demeityr, and Isaac resumed their exploration of space while Moondragon headed back for Earth. Recently, Isaac left Sundragon and the others to return to Earth.  <br/><br/>When Colony World #827 of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13918\" href=\"/rigellians/4060-13918/\" slug=\"rigellians\">Rigellians</a> was threatened by a vessel of the Dance, Sundragon came to their defense. She attempted to halt the Dance with a show of force, but they responded by knocking her aside. Sundragon responded with another attack which destroyed the Rigellian's computer systems, but did little to harm the Dance. She finally learned that the Dance's intention all along had been to prevent a comet from striking another planet, and destroyed the comet for the Dance. Exploring the planet, she found it barren of life, but as a Riegellian Recorder noted, it might one day have a grand destiny to play in the universe.<br/><br/>The current whereabouts and conditions of Sundragon and her traveling companions are unknown.<br/><br/><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities </h2>Sundragon possesses cosmic powers which include flight, the ability to survive in space without need for oxygen, and cosmic senses which can sense the distress of others. She was a novice telepath, and had various energy manipulation powers that enabled her to fire bolts of energy from both her hands, and the ability to create a giant dragon composed of energy, which she sometimes uses to travel through the cosmos.<br/><br/><h2>Paraphernalia</h2>At one time she possessed a crystal that held Gargoyle’s essence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

    "description": "<p>John Tool was a New York City cop, and very possibly the worst one.  He was clumsy, socially inept and generally prone to making mistakes and screwing up.  He was also born with one testicle, which simply adds insult to injury.  His only saving grace was that he was partnered with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41296\" href=\"/paul-bridges/4005-41296/\">Paul Bridges</a> - the \"Supercop\" of New York.</p><p>Tool and Bridges were assigned to the \"Reaver-Cleaver\" killings, so named because two competing newspapers can't agree on what to call the murderer.  These killings were grotesque and brutal, and captured the attention of the city, and made Paul Bridges - and by extension John Tool - famous.</p><p>Despite his partner, Tool was a screw-up.  He got no respect from his co-workers, and none from his boss.  Only his partner gave him any support and encouragement.  And when his partner was away, Tool was left on his own.</p><p>It was on one such day that Tool received a call from a man claiming to be the killer.  The man knew details about the killing that had not been released to the media, so Tool knew it was the real guy - but his partner was nowhere to be found.  Unlucky John Tool had to follow the leads on his own.</p><p>Eventually, he made his way to a small apartment in Manhattan, the location given to him by the killer.  He was expecting to find blood and death and terror.  What he found was his partner in the middle of a gay S&amp;M orgy.  And <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\">Jesse Custer</a>, who had also been sent to that apartment by the killer.</p><p>Tool tried to take control of the situation, but slipped in something on the floor and lost his gun.  At this point the Reaver-Cleaver, a man named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41297\" href=\"/si-coltrane/4005-41297/\">Si Coltrane</a>, appeared.  He was a journalist, known to Tool and Bridges, and was ready to frame Custer for the killings.  But he had made one grave mistake - he had tried to kill Custer's girlfriend, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10525\" href=\"/tulip/4005-10525/\">Tulip</a>.  Custer punched Coltrane, and with a voice like the Voice of God, Custer commanded him to die.  Which Coltrane did.</p><p>To cover his tracks, Custer used Tool's gun to shoot Coltrane in the head.  In return for letting the world see him as a hero for once, Tool let Custer go.  Tool received a medal for his bravery and heroism, was promoted twice, and lost both his arms two years later in a glazing accident.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Trader is an <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41142\" href=\"/elders-of-the-universe/4060-41142/\" slug=\"elders-of-the-universe\">Elder of the Universe</a> and has survived for billions of years. He is devoted and obsessed with commerce and trading. <br/><br/>He was involved in the Elders plot to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\">Galactus</a>. They believed they would become Galactus-like beings themselves when a new universe was born. This plan was foiled by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\" href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" slug=\"silver-surfer\">Silver Surfer</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11605\" href=\"/frankie-raye/4005-11605/\" slug=\"frankie-raye\">Nova</a>. She created a black hole, and the Trader fell inside. He found himself in a new universe, the Magick realm, ruled by Chaos and Order. He was accompanied by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41843\" href=\"/astronomer/4005-41843/\" slug=\"astronomer\">Astronomer </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-35779\" href=\"/possessor/4005-35779/\" slug=\"possessor\">Possessor</a>.<br/><br/>They developed a plan to recover the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\" href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" slug=\"infinity-gems\">Infinity Gems</a>, which had fallen in with them. The Silver Surfer, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\" href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" slug=\"mr-fantastic\">Mr. Fantastic</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\" href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" slug=\"invisible-woman\">Invisible Woman</a> travelled to the realm to retrieve the gems in order to save Galactus. When Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman were possessed by order and chaos, Sue betrayed the Surfer. She used a weapon she had made invisible to incapacitate him. She traded the Surfer for the gems. <br/><br/>The Silver Surfer was now in Trader's possession. He enveloped the Surfer in a field to contain him and did not allow the Surfer the use of his board. He believe he could use the Surfer to escape the realm. Mr. Fantastic told them that they were no long immortal in this realm, for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\" href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" slug=\"death\">Death </a>had no power there. They agreed to trade the Surfer for their release, even though Trader did not believe this to be a good trade, he was pressed by the Astronomer.<br/><br/>They had already arranged a deal with the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13354\" href=\"/in-betweener/4005-13354/\" slug=\"in-betweener\">In-Betweener</a>, and he helped them to escape. Once out of the Magick Realm, they asked In-Betweener to kill Galactus as promised. But he did not wish to do so because he did not want to start a new reality. When they arguesd with him, In-Betweener called upon Death and she killed Trader along with Astronomer and Possessor. It is assumed she released them once In-Betweener was sent back to his own realm, for she had agreed to bar them from her realm forever.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>David Lowell loved working with plants, that was his one true love. When he did further study on the process of <em>photosynthesis</em> he discovered that he could harness that into photogenesis, which would use the same process but on a human. He was working at Osborn Industries. After making this discovery he ran into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\" href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" slug=\"norman-osborn\">Norman Osborn</a>'s office and showed him then demanded a raise. Norman was still under the side effects of the new Green Goblin serum and instead of giving Lowell a raise, he shut down his lab. Lowell went to his lab and then consumed the formula, transforming Lowell for ever.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Sundown has the ability to draw and absorb the solar radiation from the sun which he can harness into potential class 100 strength and durability, solar energy projection, sub-sonic flight, rapid growth (estimated around 50 ft), near instantaneous healing, and some teleportation (limits unknown).</p>",

    "deck": "Vagabond was a costumed adventurer who worked with Nomad and Demolition Man.",
    "description": "<p>While hitchhiking in Kentucky she was picked up by <a href=\"/jack-monroe/4005-7618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7618\"> Nomad</a> who was passing through on his motorcycle. She told Nomad that she was on her way to Miami to find her brother, Phil, who was involved in criminal activities that include the drug trade. Nomad promised to find and rescue Phil for her.</p><p>Nomad learned that Phil was working for the <a href=\"/slug/4005-3230/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3230\">Slug</a>. Nomad found Phil on the Slug's boat and told him that his sister was looking for him, but he said he was happy. Phil told Slug about Nomad and they drugged him and threw him off the boat. However, Captain America intervened, and, with both Priscilla and Nomad, managed to defeat the Slug.</p><p> </p><p>Later, Priscilla, having adopted the identity \"Vagabond\" to compliment Jack Monroe's Nomad, travelled with her then-lover, as well as <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/demolition-man/4005-19960/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19960\">Demolition Man</a>, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\">Falcon</a>, and the Captain, the identity assumed by Steve Rogers after the United States government reclaimed the mantle of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>. During their travels, Vagabond received some martial training from her newfound friends, and assisted in their battles from time to time. She talked the <a href=\"/armadillo/4005-6800/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6800\">Armadillo</a> out of murdering his ex-wife and into returning to the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-vault/4020-43582/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43582\">Vault</a>. Vagabond also defeated <a href=\"/black-racer/4005-41292/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41292\">Black Racer</a> of the <a href=\"/serpent-society/4060-28980/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-28980\">Serpent Society</a> by tickling her. Eventually, though, a chasm formed between Vagabond and Nomad. He accused her of secretly being infatuated with D-Man. Eventually, Rogers returned to his identity of Captain America, and the group each went their separate ways.</p><p>Lyons' next encounter with a superhero occurred when she attempted to infiltrate the operations of Curtiss Jackson, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/power-broker/4005-28058/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28058\">Power Broker</a>. However, the <a href=\"/scourge-of-the-underworld/4060-58622/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58622\">Scourge of the Underworld</a> had targeted Jackson for death. The U.S. Agent got involved this time, however, and Jackson was saved and incarcerated. Lyons then attempted to join the Scourge program, but was overwhelmed by her conscience when she was sent to murder the <a href=\"/matador/4005-35893/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35893\">Matador</a>. The U.S. Agent got involved once again, and the Scourge of the Underworld program was apparently dismantled.</p><p>While Lyons whereabouts after this are unknown, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a> was considering her for his <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-initiative/4045-53970/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-53970\">Initiative </a>program.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Vagabond was created by <a href=\"/mark-gruenwald/4040-41607/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41607\">Mark Gruenwald</a> and <a href=\"/paul-neary/4040-9570/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9570\">Paul Neary</a> in 1987 and first appeared in <a href=\"/captain-america/4050-2400/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2400\">Captain America</a> # 325.</p>",

Ultimately, however, this was a ploy to maneuver <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3420\" href=\"/viper/4005-3420/\">          Viper</a> into leadership of the the society. Black Racer supported Viper in the coup and, after Sidewinder was ousted, Viper ordered her to search all the hospitals in the area for the injured former leader.</p> <p>After Viper abandoned the group, Black Racer continued to work with the Society, now lead by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11895\" href=\"/cobra/4005-11895/\">         Cobra</a>.      <br /></p><h2>Creation<br /></h2><p>Black Racer was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41607\" href=\"/mark-gruenwald/4040-41607/\">    Mark Gruenwald</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3269\" href=\"/tom-morgan/4040-3269/\">   Tom Morgan</a> in 1988 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2400\" href=\"/captain-america/4050-2400/\"> Captain America</a> # 337. <br /></p><h2>Story Arcs<br /></h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><h3>Atlantis Attacks<br /></h3></li></ul><p>Cobra would take a job from <a href=\"../../ghaur/29-14491/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                   Ghaur</a> and <a href=\"../../llyra/29-2178/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                  Llyra</a>  to obtain four objects containing arcane mystic powers.

Larfleeze ended up being the victor and shortly following his transformation into Agent Orange, he handed over the containment unit that was keeping Parallax imprisoned as a sign of good faith. Sometime later, Parallax went from being contained within the box to being imprisoned within the Green Lantern Central Power Battery. This caused the color yellow's immunity to Green Lantern rings as well as the Green Lantern rings' weakness to the color yellow.</p><p> </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Parallax was created by <a href=\"../../ron-marz/26-41799/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ron Marz</a> and <a href=\"../../darryl-banks/26-9569/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darryl Banks</a> and first appeared in Green Lantern Vol.3 #50.</p><p> </p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Parallax (unlike most characters) has not changed throughout its history, and has remained evil, manipulating, and conniving.

After being told he would be put on trial for this by a Guardian's transmission, he than gives into his fears and rage and attacks and destroys the Central Power Battery on Oa and Green Lantern Corps out of the destruction he emerged possessed by the Fear entity Parallax.</p><h3>The Final Night and The Spectre</h3><p>When Hal Jordan sacrificed himself rekindling the sun, he became the <a href=\"../../spectre/29-2361/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spectre</a>, the Spirit of Vengeance. Still, Parallax remained bound to him. The Spectre explained to Jordan the truth about Parallax. At the same time, at the headquarters of the JLA, <a href=\"../../kyle-rayner/29-40431/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kyle Rayner</a> shared similar information with <a href=\"../../green-arrow/29-5936/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Arrow</a>. Rayner explained that he journeyed to the edge of the universe, and on the tenth planet from the star Pagallus, the inhabitants told him that Parallax was actually a yellow demonic parasitic entity that was born at the beginning of sentience, feeding on fear, creating terror in anything it came into contact with, and causing entire civilizations to destroy themselves out of paranoia.</p><p> </p><h3>Green Lantern: Rebirth</h3><p>Rayner explained that there is an <a href=\"../../emotional-spectrum/12-49955/\" rel=\"nofollow\">emotional spectrum</a> from which the collective willpower of the universe is collected by the Central Power Battery, and that green willpower is the most pure. Parallax had lain dormant for billions of years, his true nature covered up by the Guardians to prevent anyone from trying to free it, and thus, it had eventually come to be referred to as simply “the yellow impurity.” This was the reason why the rings were useless against the color yellow. Parallax weakened its power over the corresponding spectrum, and hence only someone capable of overcoming great fear could master the power ring. The Guardians, therefore, selected only such persons to become <a href=\"../../green-lantern/12-41148/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Lanterns</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271638-hhh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3271638\" data-ratio=\"0.48511383537653\" data-width=\"571\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 571px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271638-hhh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3271638\"><img alt=\"Hal Breaks Free\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/120019/3271638-hhh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271638-hhh.jpg 571w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/120019/3271638-hhh.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hal Breaks Free\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/120019/3271638-hhh.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271638-hhh.jpg 571w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/120019/3271638-hhh.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hal Breaks Free</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice League Of America</a> and <a href=\"../../justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice Society Of America</a> arrived in the rebuilt Coast City to attack Parallax, but the entity inhibits their efforts by causing them to feel fear.

After awhile of beating him around, he allowed the rest of the Corps to attack him, until the <a href=\"../../lost-lanterns/65-50652/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lost Lanterns</a> intervened. Parallax had no intention of allowing this opportunity to finish what he’d started so long ago to escape him. He attacked Hal and the Lost Lanterns full force, managing to torment and kill Jack T. Chance before they escaped. It was then that Sinestro returned to Qward, and Parallax went with him into the tunnels to hunt down the Lanterns. They managed to corner Hal and the other Earth lanterns, and while Sinestro dealt with Jordan, Parallax attacked Guy Gardner. He almost managed to kill the Lantern before the rest of the Lost Lanterns arrived yet again, this time with Ion in tow, and managed to escape again. Sinestro later sent him to scout ahead in Coast City and prepare for the final assault.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/747556-peril_011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-747556\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.22338830584708\" data-width=\"667\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 667px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:22.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/747556-peril_011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-747556\"><img alt=\"Even though he's back in prison he still lingers in Kyle's mind.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/747556-peril_011.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/747556-peril_011.jpg 667w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/747556-peril_011.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Even though he's back in prison he still lingers in Kyle's mind.\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/747556-peril_011.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/747556-peril_011.jpg 667w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/747556-peril_011.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Even though he's back in prison he still lingers in Kyle's mind.</figcaption></figure><p>While all of this was going on, Parallax was also dealing with Kyle Rayner. Trapped inside his own mind when Parallax took over his body, Kyle has been forced to watch him commit these heinous acts. While he had been fighting Hal Jordan, he had tormented him about his lost loved ones, <a href=\"../../donna-troy/29-4913/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Donna Troy</a>, <a href=\"../../jade/29-3406/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jade</a>, <a href=\"../../alexandra-dewitt/29-41167/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex</a>, and his mother. Using the power of his mind, Kyle attempted to fight back, but Parallax was stronger. He was able to crush his spirit, or so Parallax thought. Kyle managed to find hope and the power to fight back just as events in reality happened. Parallax’s first stop was the home of Hal Jordan’s brother’s family. Just as he was about to attack his family, Jordan arrived and attacked him, dragging him out into the desert and away from his family. Hal called out to Kyle, and managed to get through to him, but his power ring died just as he was about to save him. Parallax absorbed Hal as well, and now with both of them seemed more powerful than ever. John Stewart arrived just as this occurred, and was forced to face this new foe. John managed to hold him off until Guy arrived with a painting Kyle’s mother drew to help him snap out of it. Inside of Parallax Kyle and Hal together managed to find the willpower to escape. Parallax was not yet defeated and, while the Lanterns celebrated, he made his move to regain his prisoners. It was only with the timely intervention of former Guardians, Ganthet and Sayd, that he was denied his victory. The two Oans trapped him in the four individual power batteries of the Earth Lanterns. He is currently still trapped.</p><p> </p><h3>Blackest Night</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271663-2103203645-14018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3271663\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271663-2103203645-14018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3271663\"><img alt=\"Hal Jordan as Parallax Once More\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271663-2103203645-14018.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271663-2103203645-14018.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hal Jordan as Parallax Once More\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271663-2103203645-14018.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3271663-2103203645-14018.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hal Jordan as Parallax Once More</figcaption></figure><p>He was released by Hal Jordan to help him battle a black ring possessed Spectre during Blackest Night, because Hal said that the Spectre was afraid of Parallax. Hal Jordan willingly offered himself to be Parallax's host again. Now fused with Parallax, Hal was able to free the Spectre from his imprisonment in the Black Power Ring. The Spectre admits that he is afraid of Parallax and his kind. With the help of the Spectre and Carol Ferris, Hal was released from the Parasite's hold. Just before Parallax was able to fuse with Sinestro, he was warped to a distant location by unknown means.</p><h3>Brightest Day/New Guardians</h3><p>During the Brightest Day arc, in issue #54 of Green Lantern. Parallax is seen chained to a pillar with it's corps symbol underneath. Other pillars have the other Corps symbols, but Parallax is currently only one of two being chained up, along with Ion.

He caused great destruction until he was imprisoned on the planet Ryut by the Green Lantern Abin Sur. He is accidentally freed by alien astronauts that came upon his prison. Parallax attacked Abin Sur's ship and mortally wounded him, but not before he could eject himself from his ship to Earth, where Abin Sur gave his power ring to Hal Jordan. Parallax began killing other Green Lanterns and destroying civilizations until it reached Earth. Meanwhile, Hector Hammond obtained psionic power after coming in contact with a portion of Parallax on Abin Sur's body as he was performing an autopsy. As Parallax arrived on Earth, interrupting Hector and Hal's battle. Parallax kills Hector for failing to destroy Hal and attempts to kill him, but Carol Ferris helped him escape. Hal then tricks Parallax into following him out into space and get Parallax trapped in the sun's gravitational pull. Parallax was burned up by the sun.</p><h4>Powers</h4><p>Parallax had the ability to kill any living creatures by absorbing their life force out of them via their fear. The more life force and fear it absorbs, the stronger and larger it gets. Parallax could also fire powerful yellow energy blasts from it's mouth. It also gave Hector Hammond psionic powers after contact with a portion of Parallax on Abin Sur's body. Hammond and Parallax could telepathically communicate.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Every police department has one - the \"hero cop.\"  This is the guy they modeled Dirty Harry after, the kind of guy that would be played by Schwarzenegger in the movie, if they made one.  The kind of guy who gets his partner killed and then goes on a one-man killing spree for vengeance and, if at all possible, justice.</p><p>In New York, Paul Bridges was that cop.  He had a history of making the tough busts and not taking crap from suspects.  So, when a serial killer appeared in the city, it was only natural that Bridges, and his inept partner <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41279\" href=\"/john-tool/4005-41279/\">John Tool</a>, get the case.</p><p>Bridges was the public face of the investigation, and everyone loved him, but he was a man of very private passions.  He had a short temper with everyone but his partner, and was virulently homophobic.  He would often talk about wanting to \"organize a cull\" and \"mow [them] all down.\"</p><p>So it came as a great surprise to everyone that Bridges was secretly involved in a homosexual S&amp;M group.  He was discovered first by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\">Jesse Custer</a>, who was led to a certain apartment by the man who was in fact the serial killer, and then by his own partner, who had been given the same information.  The plan had been for the real killer, a freelance journalist named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41297\" href=\"/si-coltrane/4005-41297/\">Si Coltrane</a>, to frame Jesse for the killings.  None of them expected Bridges to be dressed in a leather harness getting whipped by other men.</p><p>When the killer was taken down and Jesse left with his girlfriend, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10525\" href=\"/tulip/4005-10525/\">Tulip</a>, Bridges broke down and confessed everything to Tool, who thought that his partner might be a little touched in the head.</p><p>Bridges quit the force, but stayed in contact with Tool.  His current whereabouts and activities are unknown.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Si Coltrane was, in his words, \"living the dream\" of the freelance journalist.  He lived in a cheap apartment filled with pizza boxes and empty beer bottles, wrote to the deadlines and had angry editors calling at all hours.  And he loved it.</p><p>He hunted down the strange stories of New York City - blind fortunetellers, unexplained phenomena and serial killers.</p><p>It was this last type that was going to be his claim to fame.  A new killer had arrived in New York, one who abducted men, tortured them, dismembered them horribly, and then left them to be found by the police.  One newspaper dubbed him \"The Reaver.\"  Another called him \"The Cleaver.\"  Neither paper was willing to back down, so the killer became known as \"The Reaver-Cleaver.\"  And Coltrane seemed to have the inside track.  His articles contained enough detail to make the police nervous about a leak in the investigation.  Si Coltrane was at the top of his game with this story, and for a very good reason - Si Coltrane was the Reaver-Cleaver.</p><p>When his old friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10527\" href=\"/cassidy/4005-10527/\" slug=\"cassidy\"> Cassidy</a> showed up, looking for help with a weird problem, Si was happy to assist.  Cassidy's friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\" slug=\"jesse-custer\"> Jesse Custer</a> was looking for God, in a real, physical sense.  Cass figured that if anyone could help find a lead it would be Si.  So Cassidy, Jesse and his girlfriend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10525\" href=\"/tulip/4005-10525/\" slug=\"tulip\"> Tulip</a> came to New York, and Si hatched a plan.</p><p>He knew the police wouldn't stop hunting the killer, but he certainly didn't want to get caught.  So he set called the police and told them that he was at his apartment and he was ready to face them, but he certainly wasn't going to go quietly.  Si's plan?  For the police to bust in on his vampire friend Cassidy, who would almost certainly kill a few of them trying to escape and then burst into flames in the sunlight.</p><p>Cassidy escaped death by the police by jamming a knife through his own throat and playing dead.  As far as the NYPD were concerned, he was just another victim.</p><p>As for Jesse, Si fed him a story about a blind man who can get around without any help - he claims that God tells him where to go.  If anyone could give Jesse help, he might.  So he drove Jesse and Tulip there, and put his plan in motion.</p><p>The apartment he'd sent Jesse to was, in fact, a gay S&amp;M club where the head of the Reaver-Cleaver investigation, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41296\" href=\"/paul-bridges/4005-41296/\" slug=\"paul-bridges\"> Paul Bridges</a>, secretly frequented.  The plan was for Jesse to go in, and then Si would appear to help apprehend the \"dangerous criminal.\"  To keep Tulip from interfering, he pinned her hand to the dashboard of the car using a large hunting knife.  Then he grabbed a shotgun and went inside.  He had already called Bridges' partner, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41279\" href=\"/john-tool/4005-41279/\" slug=\"john-tool\"> John Tool</a>, and was prepared to be the hero.</p><p>His plan would have gone perfectly except for two small problems.  First, Tulip was a lot tougher than he thought her bag, and followed him up.  When he was distracted, the other unplanned problem came up: Jesse's Voice of God.</p><p>Jesse knocked Si down with a hard left and Commanded him to die.  And he did.  Jesse shot the corpse in the head with John Tool's gun, and Tool became a hero for stopping a vicious criminal.</p>",

He lent her the money to go into rehab and clean up.  When she came out, though, he found out that she didn't have the cash to pay him back, nor was she going to pay him with sexual favors.  He threatened to put her back in the hospital, but she offered to work off her debt.</p><p>The only jobs he had going, though, were hits, and he laughed when she said she could do them.  He stopped laughing when she showed him that she was a fantastic shot with a handgun.</p><p>He gave her a job - kill a guy who was muscling in on his turf.  Easy.</p><p>Unfortunately for MacAvoy, Tulip was not the cold-hearted killer that she thought she was.  She botched the hit and left town in a hurry.</p><p>He got a call a week or so later from Tulip in New York - she wanted to explain and apologize, but he wouldn't have it.

Sandi, with Hayden's help, use a sniper rifle to shoot Fight-Man in the head while he sleeps.Alex wake the next day to find Sandi is gone and, while confirming their kill, find that his body is not there. Alex gets a call from Sandi and finds she has been captured by Beverly and will be killed if he doesn't kill Frank. When Alex finds frank in his home he shoots him multiple times only to have all the bullets ricochet and hit himself. Fight-Man ties up Alex and tells him about his past revealing that he was a major superhero until he went to prison after fourteen of his teenage sidekicks had died. He was charged with \"wrongful death, endagering a minor, destruction of public property, and flying while intoxicated. Frank is now forbidden by law to use his powers or be near minors. After Frank's wife sends several henchmen to attack Frank, Alex and Frank decide to go and save Sandi instead of trying to kil Frank. Alex and Frank fight their way through several henchmen to a climactic battle with Beverly, who has been endowed with superpower. She is quickly dispached by one of her henchmen who fell from the sky. In keeping with his own code, and to try and get in the parole board's good graces, Fight-man attempts to arrest Alex but has his pants ripped off and runs off embaressed. He is then crushed by a bulding vowing to get his revenge some day.</p><p> </p><p>Fight-Man, sleeps with a teddy bear, is suicidal... except for the fact he cannot kill himself because he has Superman type abilities without the Kryptonite.

Fight man has proven to be very oblivious to his surroundings while battling, damaging friends and enemies alike.</p><p> </p><p>Fight-Man also morally binds himself to never kill a living thing, this contradicts his own desire to end his own life. And although he refuses to let Agent X kill anyone else, Fight-Man encourages Alex to aid him in ending his own life. He also has a code against hitting women, which proved a big weakness in the final battle with his wife.</p><p> </p><p><u><b>Powers</b></u></p><p>Invulnerability- Fight-man's body is virtually indestructible and therefor fight-man cannot be injured or killed by any exterior physical means. While shown to lose teeth after fights, the only injuries that seemed to incapacitate him were entire buildings falling on top of him.</p><p>Flight- Fight-man has the ability to fly at very fast speeds.

Their minds cringe at the thought of men raping men, and cower at the idea that it might be worse.</p><p>T.C. puts all of their worst fears in the shade.</p><p>He worked at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41399\" href=\"/angelville/4020-41399/\" slug=\"angelville\">Angelville</a>, a small estate run by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41328\" href=\"/marie-langell/4005-41328/\" slug=\"marie-langell\">Marie L'Angell</a> near the Texas-Louisiana border.  Like most of the hands at Angelville, he does his share of chores and maintenance.  With his best friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10529\" href=\"/jody/4005-10529/\" slug=\"jody\">Jody</a> he does his share of mayhem and murder.  But what really occupies his mind, what is foremost in every thought, is sex.  He will have sex with anyone or anything that crosses his path.  Male or female, animal or vegetable, willing or unwilling, alive or dead, if he has a chance, he will have sex with it.</p><p>On an estate that was once called, \"the most goddamned awful place there is,\" T.C. fit right in.</p><p>Together with Jody, he tracked down <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10537\" href=\"/christina-custer/4005-10537/\" slug=\"christina-custer\">Christina Custer</a>, the daughter of Miss L'Angell, who had run away from that horrible place.  They found her in Texas, along with her husband <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10548\" href=\"/john-custer/4005-10548/\" slug=\"john-custer\">John Custer</a> and their young son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\" slug=\"jesse-custer\">Jesse Custer</a>.  T.C. and Jody threatened to start killing if the three of them didn't come back to Angelville, and so they did.</p><p>When John Custer tried to spirit his family away from Angelville some years later, T.C. and Jody caught them, and shot John in the head.  When Jesse misbehaved and had to be punished by being locked in a coffin in the swamp, T.C. was there.  When Jesse's best friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41332\" href=\"/billy-bob-bobbs/4005-41332/\" slug=\"billy-bob-bobbs\">Billy-Bob Bobbs</a> caught T.C. having sex with a chicken, T.C. killed him.</p><p>And when an adult Jesse and his girlfriend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10525\" href=\"/tulip/4005-10525/\" slug=\"tulip\">Tulip</a> were brought back to Angelville, T.C.'s sexual proclivities were used to make Jesse bend to his grandmother's will.  Together with Jody and Miss Marie, he thought Jesse was beaten.</p><p>They were all, of course, wrong.</p><p>Jesse regained his senses, and his Voice of God, and beat the tar out of T.C.  Then he went after Jody.</p><p>Tulip, despite being shot in the head from point-blank range, was alive - resurrected by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10526\" href=\"/god/4005-10526/\" slug=\"god\">God</a>.  And she was very, very angry.  She grabbed a shotgun, pointed it at T.C.'s head, and very happily blew it off.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A member of the mutant offshoot group the Neo. After the High Evolutionary, deeming the mutant population too dangerous, turned all mutants into baseline humans, several Neo, living peacefully in isolation, died, dependent upon their powers for what they were doing at the time. For an unknown reason, possibly hearing who caused the depowering and his reasons saw the X-Men's very public existence as the cause of the High Evolutionary's decision, Domina, whose daughter died underwater losing her ability to survive there, blamed the X-Men and sought vengeance against them. Barbican was a member of Domina's Warclan who fought the X-Men. <br/> <br/>Magneto approached the Neo and told them to join him in Genosha. They fought back and Magneto killed two of them. Domina then bowed before Magneto and agreed they would go with him. It is assumed Barbican joined them. <br/> <br/>It is unclear whether or not Barbican or any of the Neo survived Cassandra Nova's Sentinel assault on Genosha. If any survived, it would be assumed they lost their powers on M-Day.</p>",

    "deck": "Cerebra is a member of the X-Men in 2099.",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Shakti Haddad is a founding member of the <a href=\"/x-men-2099/4060-41504/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41504\">X-Men 2099</a> and founder of <a href=\"/x-nation-2099/4060-43158/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43158\">X-Nation 2099</a>. She was the daughter of Zail Haddad, a powerful and ruthless businessman, whose company did many twisted genetic experiments on innocents for their own profit. Shakti was a brilliant young woman and became an expert in genetics, but her compassionate nature made her oppose her father's company. She fled her native land of <a href=\"/india/4020-55919/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55919\">India</a> and Zail sent various bounty hunters after his daughter. One of these bounty hunters fell in love with Shakti, and together the two escaped, but he was suffering a lethal disease and left her before the disease would kill him. Years later, she would meet him again, when he called himself the <a href=\"/the-architect/4005-24540/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24540\">Architect</a>.</p><p>Cerebra became a founding member of the futuristic version of the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> gathered together by <a href=\"/desert-ghost/4005-41319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41319\">Xi'an Chi Xan</a>, and a mainstay throughout the series. However, most of her support was not in combat but instead behind the scenes. When she was first introduced, she recruited a mutant named Timothy Fitzgerald a.k.a. <a href=\"/skullfire/4005-41323/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41323\">Skullfire</a> into the fold.</p><p>Later, Cerebra showed up during the battle with <a href=\"/master-zhao/4005-43869/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43869\">Master Zhao</a> and his group of Chosen X-Men. Zhao had used unstable technology to further mutate his chosen group in order for them to more closely resemble the group of original <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> (<a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/marvel-girl/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a>, and <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a>), but this process had left the unwilling guinea pigs in a condition where their cellular structure was deteriorating. After the battle, when this fact was discovered, Cerebra went about trying to find a way to cure their condition by placing them in cryogenic suspension. It became a pet project for her and almost cost her life. When Xi'an finally turned on the team, the <a href=\"/theatre-of-pain/4060-41423/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41423\">Theatre of Pain</a> came to collect the three surviving mutants, just after Shakti had discovered a way to save the three. Shakti tried to stop them, but was knocked out by Xi'an. He set explosives in Master Zhao's old base, but Shakti woke up in time to wake the other X-Men and escape the base before it exploded.</p><p>Soon afterwards the X-Men attacked the <a href=\"/theatre-of-pain/4060-41423/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41423\">Theatre of Pain</a> and Xi'an was restored to his old self and the X-Men were made the protectors of Halo City. Shakti's father, Zail, sought refuge in Halo City from the Grave-robber, a former employee who had been turned into a corpse-like zombie due to Zail's negligence. The Graverobber and his Undead took Halo City hostage and the Halo City administrator, <a href=\"/graverobber/4005-41527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41527\">Morphine Somers</a>, used Zail as bait to capture the Graverobber. Due to Morphine's plan, Zail was seriously wounded, but survived and Shakti and Zail made peace.</p><p>President Doom came to Shakti with a rumor of a soon-to-come mutant Messiah. He or she was supposed to come in the body of a young child, so Doom wanted to assure that the young savior would be in his hands. He gave Shakti the task of collecting and training these children in Halo City and thus X-Nation was born. Shakti actually had little to no involvement in the team except for a session of anger management counseling before the team was disbanded by a combination of the revived <a href=\"/exodus/4005-4567/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4567\">Exodus</a>, the invading Atlantean army, and other malevolent forces.</p><p>In the follow-up limited series 2099: World of Tomorrow, Shakti lost her mutant powers and the use of her legs due to Franklin, a robot who also destroyed her nervous system. Shakti's father was able to repair the damage done to her nervous system, but could not restore her mutant powers or the use of her legs. She became one of the members of the new colony in the Savage Land which finally seemed to bring humans and mutants together peacefully.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Shakti possesses a specific form of telepathy that allows her to 'sense' mutants in a similar manner to Charles Xavier's “Cerebro\". She also has the ability to manipulate a person's nervous system. For instance, she can paralyze them as well as stun and render them unconscious or access any autonomic functions. Shakti has a small implant below her left ear that allows her to directly connect to computers and the Cybernet.</p>",

Xi’an tried to put his past of crime, violence, and anger behind him, and strove to build a team dedicated to the teachings of the 20th Century’s Professor X, becoming the leader of the fourth incarnation of the X-Men. To that end, he brought Shakti Haddad away from Stark/Fujikawa to use her abilities to find the most powerful mutants alive. Then he invited a huge group of outcasts and misfits to the Nuevo Sol Arcology, and once the mutant Timothy Fitzgerald answered his invitation and joined the gathering, his team was complete.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Desert Ghost (or Xi'an Chi Xanh) was created by John Francis Moore and Ron Lim and first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/x-men-2099-1-the-gathering/4000-105839/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men 2099 issue 1</a> (1993).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The X-Men are Formed</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/138754-131325-desert-ghost.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/138754-131325-desert-ghost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/138754-131325-desert-ghost.jpg\"></a></figure><p>But his friend and fellow ex-Lawless-member, Junkpile, disagreed with his new vision and turned on him, alerting the security force of Las Vegas’ Synge Corporation, who believed Xi’an had murdered their leader, Noah Synge, to the location of the gathering. Synge sent a sniper in ahead of the security force, and the assassin took a shot at Xi’an when he was making a speech to the assembled crowd. But Timothy used his mutant power to drain electricity and fire it in the form of energy blasts to ruin the hitman’s shot, but Xi’an was still injured. The rest of the X-Men rushed to safety during the ensuing raid, bringing Xi’an with them. But though Xi’an was injured, his mutant powers began to evolve, and his body created a hard, red carapace that acted as cocoon to protect him while he was hurt. And when he freed himself from the cocoon he found that, in addition to his ability to destroy things with one hand, he was also capable of healing with the other hand. Upon his emergence from the cocoon, Xi’an found himself in the Synge morgue, with Junkpile attacking his X-Men and standing over the body of Serpentina. Xi’an fought him, and defeated him, using his powers to break Junkpile’s metal body apart, but leaving him alive, believing that killing him would be the wrong choice. The X-Men later cleared Xi’an of Synge’s murder.</p><p>While the rest of the team followed their teammate Meanstreak onto the floating city of Valhalla, Xi’an fought a personal battle against his outlaw personality that appeared to him as a ghost, which continued to haunt him about his past. This reemergence of his past began to tell on Xi’an, and he snapped at Meanstreak when he returned for leaving without permission. Later, when the X-Men picked up broadcasts from Mama Hurricane, Xi’an took them to see her to find out if she really was the Great Purge’s hero, Hurricane. They found that she was, and Xi’an quizzed her about the past, discovering that she worked with a being called the Driver, who would carry mutants to a paradise known as Avalon. Only afterwards, when fighting a twisted version of the 20th Century’s X-Men, and their leader Zhao, did Xi’an’s dark personality take over while inside the psychic landscape of Xi’an’s mind that Zhao created to dominate him. Using this personality, Xi’an bested Zhao, leaving him comatose, and letting the old persona take over. Believing that his dream of peace between mutants and humans was a mistake, along with the creation of the X-Men, Xi’an left them to search out the Driver and the city of Avalon.</p><p>His fellow X-Man Skullfire joined him, as he was dealing with his own personality issues at the time, and together they hunted down another of Xi’an’s ex-Lawless members, Broken Haiku. Haiku reluctantly gave Xi’an the whereabouts of the Driver, using the data from a disk of rendezvous points that Hurricane gave him, but in act of revenge she also alerted the Driver that Xi’an was coming for him. Together with Skullfire, La Lunatica, an escaped member of the Theatre of Pain, and Junkpile, whose betrayal Xi’an quickly forgave, Xi’an set out to locate the Driver. They found him in Sulphur Springs Valley, Arizona, in a hidden headquarters, where it was revealed that the Driver would take mutants and mentally upload them into a database until the world was ready for them to return. Xi’an attempted to stop him, but Brimstone Love, the head of the Theatre of Pain, appeared and accidentally destroyed the database while fighting with the Driver. Instead of claiming Lunatica as he had planned, Brimstone offered Xi’an a place at the Theatre, recognizing him to be a powerful ally. Much to the surprise of the X-Men present, Xi’an agreed, and Brimstone transported away with Xi’an, leaving Lunatica free for the moment.</p><p>While the other X-Men worked to break into and destroy the Theatre of Pain, Xi’an began his indoctrination into the Theatre during a psychic trial which took Xi’an through his past, where he confronted old enemies and was eventually broken down and made into Controller X, one of the artists of the Theatre that would record the suffering of individual victims and transmit it to paying customers. Xi’an later stole the comatose body of Zhao, as well as Zhao’s frozen X-Men, and brought them to the Theatre where Zhao was used to power the Mindfire Machine, and his X-Men were revived and used against Xi’an’s former teammates. Using the Mindfire Machine, Xi’an and the Theatre began a massive broadcast in which they tapped into the suffering of a crowd of victims and projected that suffering to numerous patrons around the world. But the X-Men interrupted the broadcast before it could go too far, reversing it on the viewers, and together with the new President Doom’s troops, they brought down the Theatre of Pain. It was only with the help of Xi’an, who turned the Mindfire Machine on Brimstone Love, hoping to take control of the Theatre himself, that the assembled heroes were able to overcome the leader of the Theatre. But Brimstone himself disappeared immediately afterwards, never to be seen again. Lunatica, who used her powers to draw out past suffering, attacked Xi’an and brought him out of his selfish destruction. Dishonored, Xi’an returned to the X-Men, yet believing himself unworthy of a position as their leader.</p><p>In repentance, Xi’an set himself up in the polyclinic of Halo City, a city created by President Doom to hold the victims of the Theatre, as a healer to any and all who needed him; despite the physical toll that healing took upon him. He continued with his healing until the group known as the Undead and their master, the Graverobber, blew up the hospital. Later, Ten Eagles appeared and told him that a man calling himself the Foolkiller was hunting down their ex-Lawless members, and had even attacked and severed Ten Eagles right arm. They contacted the other remaining members of the Lawless, Auntie Maim and Mongrel, and together they prepared to fight the Foolkiller. Once he arrived, he explained that he was the last of a group of religious zealots dedicated to ridding the world of fools, based off of a 20th Century masked killer, and that the Lawless had ridden into his town one day and unfairly massacred the last of his people. Even though Xi’an tried to convince him that the Lawless had been attacked and tortured, and only destroyed the town out of self defense, the Foolkiller didn’t listen and fought the remaining members of the Lawless until he was distracted when Lunatica attacked and brought up his old memories. Xi’an gave him one last chance to give up, but the Foolkiller detonated a bomb connected to his chest instead, killing himself instead of admitting he was wrong for doing what he did. When the city flooded, Xi’an was trying to rebuild the polyclinic with Ten Eagles, and was forced to flee the city via the service tunnels, along with Cerebra and the X-Nation’s Nostromo. They found themselves in a secret transporter room instead, and teleported themselves to where the rest of the X-Men were fighting Vulcann, his Darkson, and the Atlanteans. Xi’an saved the X-Men from being drowned while tied to a ship’s mast, and then watched as Darkson defeated the Atlanteans and Metalhead and Bloodhawk destroyed Bloodsmith. Then, as a passenger on the last boat out of Halo City, Xi’an headed to the last dry place on Earth, the Savage Land, with the rest of the X-Men.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Xi'an has mutated hands: one that allows him to disintegrate matter upon contact and another that heals injuries and sicknesses. It was also discovered after his body sustains massive injury it forms a healing cocoon around himself.</p>",

    "deck": "Krystalin is a mutant with the power to spin crystal and is a member of X-Men 2099.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Krys Porter Ogada was a member of Xi’an Chi Xan’s X-Men in the year 2099, when the Synge Corporation attacked Xi’an’s gathering and attempted to assassinate him. Krystalin had recently returned from a rescue mission alongside her teammate, Meanstreak, to save the mutant Bloodhawk from the Synge Corporation and offer him a place on the team. But Bloodhawk refused, and the pair returned to the Neuvo Sol Arcology empty-handed.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p><b>Krystalin</b> is a fictional character in Marvel Comics's 2099 universe, a look at superheroes in the year <a title=\"2099\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2099\" rel=\"nofollow\">2099</a>. She first appeared in X-Men 2099 #1 October 1999 and was created by John Francis Moore and Ron Lim. She was one of the founding members of a future incarnation of the <a title=\"X-Men\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> called <a title=\"X-Men 2099\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_2099\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men 2099</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>With the X-Men</h3><p>Shortly afterwards, the Synge Corporation attacked, believing that Xi’an had murdered their founder, Noah Synge. An assassin wounded Xi’an, and Synge’s security forces raided the gathering. The X-Men escaped with the injured Xi’an and fought back by breaking into the Synge Corporation to prove Xi’an’s innocence. Krystalin joined Meanstreak and another teammate, Metalhead, on the mission, but her other two companions were quickly captured by Synge’s Rat Pack. Krystalin escaped and snuck into the office of the new head of the corporation, Lytton Synge. She threatened him with a crystal shard until the X-Men’s betrayer, Junkpile, grabbed her from behind. Soon, the rest of the X-Men arrived and rescued their fellow teammates, and together they fought with Junkpile and rescued her and Xi’an, who had been taken by Junkpile. But Junkpile killed Serpentina in the fight before Xi’an disabled him with his destroying hand. The X-Men later buried Serpentina in a crystal coffin, created by Krystalin.</p><p>The remaining X-Men returned to their temporary headquarters at the abandoned Hoover Dam, but soon Meanstreak left to find his friend, Jordan Boone. Krystalin and Timothy Fitzgerald followed him, but La Lunatica of the Theatre of Pain captured them on the way to New York. Though when Luna used her powers to expose and feed off of painful, repressed memories, Timothy’s electrical powers went berserk and fried the restraining collars on the X-Men, as well as Luna. Luna quickly turned on her masters, leaving the X-Men free to leave the Theatre. Krystalin and her fellow X-Men returned to the investigation of Meanstreak’s friend. They traveled first to his apartment, and based on a hidden journal of Boone’s, they continued on to the office of the man-beast, Ravage. Ravage was unable to give them any information about their friend, but he pointed them to Alchemax’s floating city, Valhalla, which Boone had been researching. Then, together with Ravage, the X-Men traveled to the floating city and fought with the genetically engineered Heimdall. Meanstreak was able to destroy Heimdall only when his friend Boone, engineered to be the Asgardian god, Loki, gave him a device to shut off Heimdall’s powers. Krystalin and the rest then helped the citizens of Valhalla escape while the 2099’s Spider-Man, Punisher, Doom, and Ravage shut the failing city down.</p><p>While the rest of the X-Men searched for the woman known as Mama Hurricane, Xi’an charged Krystalin with finding and meeting up with his old, fellow Lawless member, Victor Ten Eagles, in Santa Fe. Krystalin found him there and showed him the card with the X on it that Xi’an had given her. Ten Eagles then brought her to see a silhouetted figure that resembled the 20th Century X-Men’s Archangel. But after they investigated an attacked commune, where the workers were frozen to death, and a base in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, they discovered that the silhouette was one of Zhao’s genetically-accelerated X-Men, he called the Chosen, who were engineered to mimic Charles Xavier’s original group. The one that resembled Archangel was a mutant called Wingspan. They fought with Zhao’s X-Men, and nearly bested them, until Zhao appeared and used his psychic abilities to knock both unconscious. Krystalin later sent a message to Xi’an to join them in the mountains, and when the X-Men arrived they found Krystalin and Ten Eagles hypnotized and encouraging the rest to join Zhao’s group. But they disagreed, and after a battle with Zhao’s X-Men, they were all captured. Though because Xi’an’s mind was too strong to hypnotize in the same way, Zhao entered his mind in order to dominate him, but Xi’an’s repressed, criminal personality took over Xi’an’s mind and defeated Zhao, leaving him comatose.</p><p>Xi’an and Timothy, then called Skullfire, later left the group. But only Skullfire returned, with Luna, and explained that Xi’an left to join the Theatre of Pain. Shortly afterwards, Krystalin’s brother Zakarii called her and informed her that their father, Andre Daniel Ogada, head of the Soldiers of the Panther, had died. Krystalin headed to Oakland at her brother’s request, for their father’s funeral. After the funeral, a downpour, laced with hallucinogens by the Free Radical group, disoriented Krystalin. She recovered quickly and went to dinner with her brother. During dinner, they repeated the same arguments their parents had, where Krystalin was concerned about spirituality and inner searching, and Zak pushed the necessity of the Soldiers of the Panther over any other considerations. Then Daze, one of the Free Radicals, attacked and kidnapped Zak. Krystalin woke up alone, until Zak’s second in command, Miko Nishihara, arrived and together they listened to the demands of the group via a recording. The Free Radicals offered Zak’s life in exchange for the freedom of a captured member of their group, Billy Zedd, aka Billy the Kid. Miko wanted Krystalin to stay out of the fight, and so she turned to an old friend, Havana, who brought her to Nurf, a psychedelic-obsessed follower of the musical group, the Disinterred. Nurf brought Krystalin to the ruins of Berkley University, where the two fell into a trapdoor and were soon captured by the Free Radicals. When Miko refused to negotiate with them, Krystalin agreed to free their friend from jail. Krystalin broke into the prison using the identity of a dead Panther, and freed Billy. Miko appeared and attacked her, but before she could beat Krystalin in hand-to-hand combat, Billy threw a neural shock toy on her, reducing her to a fetal position. Once Krystalin returned with Billy, she found that the Free Radicals still wouldn’t let either her or her brother go. Krystalin had no choice but to break free from her bonds and destroy a satellite set to release an EMPulse over half the state. In the resulting confusion, Zak set off a beacon to the Panthers, and the Free Radicals quickly escaped. Then, before Zak and Krystalin could argue about whose fault it was, Doom’s message declaring himself President came through. Krystalin then caught up with Meanstreak, who was dealing with his friend Boone’s transformation into Halloween Jack, and his takeover of Las Vegas. Krystalin encouraged Meanstreak to leave Jack, who taunted them about their obvious mutual attraction, and Doom appeared to contain Jack’s unreality field in time to keep Jack from hurting Krystalin. Together they left Vegas to return to the X-Men.</p><p>When the Theatre of Pain captured the rest of the X-Men, Krystalin and Meanstreak contacted Bloodhawk to help them rescue their teammates. Krystalin nearly fell into a fissure caused by the L.A. earthquake until Bloodhawk swooped down and saved her. They soon traveled to the Theatre and saved the mutants Quiver and Sham from the Theatre’s security, outside the Floodgate, the Theatre’s gathering point for its victims. They arrived in time to fight Zhao’s X-Men, unthawed and controlled by the Theatre, and watched as Xi’an turned on the Theatre’s leader, Brimstone Love. But before Xi’an could turn on the X-Men, Luna used her powers to shock him out of his criminal persona. Then Doom appeared again, announcing that he had created Halo City to act as a refuge for the Theatre’s victims. Krystalin and the X-Men later traveled to Halo City and became the city’s Protectorate. Krystalin joined Meanstreak in patrolling the city, and later, while the rest of the X-Men fought the Graverobber’s Undead, Krystalin was with Morphine Somers, the acting governor of Halo City, when Anthony Herod attempted to assassinate him. Herod sent a Kamikaze Brain Blaster to seek out Somers and explode, but Krystalin encased it in crystal and threw it through the window, where it exploded harmlessly. Krystalin joined the X-Men for the final fight with the Graverobber when Somers planted a bomb on Graverobber’s hostage, which exploded and killed the Graverobber. She was there when Victor Ten Eagles appeared and told Xi’an that a man calling himself the Foolkiller was hunting down and killing their former Lawless members, and had torn off Ten Eagles right arm. Krystalin also helped the remaining ex-Lawless fight the Foolkiller, and alerted the Protectorate to assist, calling Meanstreak who disappeared while running to her aid. When Halo City flooded, thanks to the approaching planetoid, Krystalin helped her fellow X-Men rescue many of the city’s citizens from the raging waters. She was also among the X-Men who were captured by Vulcann and Metalhead’s godson, hyper-aged by Vulcann into Darkson. Once Darkson destroyed the invading Atlanteans, and Vulcann himself was killed by the combined efforts of Bloodhawk and Metalhead, Krystalin boarded the last boat out of Halo City. Along with the rest of her teammates, she sailed away to the Savage Land, the last dry piece of land on the planet.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Krystalin is capable of extracting minerals from the atmosphere to form hard crystalline constructs of various shapes and size, usually in the form of offensive weapons (such as bo staffs) but occasionally in defensive ways (such as shields, armor, and slides).</p><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>During the comic book, no other name was given to Krystalin than Krys--a shortening of her codename. However, on her trading card it gave her name as Ruth Kristen. Her mother's last name was Porter and her father's was Ogada, so henceforth the amalgamation of all of them.</li><li>It was inferred that Krystalin and Victor Ten Eagles had some sort of romantic fling. She was the only member of the X-Men whom Victor trusted and later in the series when Krystalin showed concern for him he told her that their relationship had been \"diverting\" for both of them from the stress of their lives.</li></ul>",

When a man named Xi'an broke him out of a Alchemax contract Henri began a new purpose. He would call himself Meanstreak and give up his past. He did this so the world could be a better place for all mutants. While the Xi'an gathering was happening Henri and <a href=\"/krystalin/4005-41320/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41320\">Krystalin</a> were trying to get <a href=\"/bloodhawk/4005-41424/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41424\">Bloodhawk</a> away from the Synge Corporation so they could offer him to join there team.

Meanstreak and the other X-men went to go clear his name. On this mission they were captured but, soon enough the other X-men came and helped them. So in the end they cleared Xi'an's name of the murder. When Meanstreak's friend was in trouble he ignored Xi'an and went to go find his friend. <a href=\"/skullfire/4005-41323/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41323\">Skullfire</a> went with him to help him. There they were captured by the theater of pain. Where they tortured Skullfire which made his powers go off and release them from the theater of pain. The men then went to his friends apartment where the found a journal that led to the mutant Ravage. Ravage had no answers so he led them to a floating city called Valhalla. When they arrived meanstreak' friend had been turned into Loki. They then were attacked by <a href=\"/heimdall/4005-3508/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3508\">Heimdall</a> but he was defeated when Meanstreak's friend gave them a control that turned off his powers. The rest of the X-men got off the city before the vigilante heroes got the city under control. Henri went with the X-men to find Mama Hurricane. This is when everyone decided to split up. But, Meanstreak decided to stay with the remaining X-men. Meanstreak met up with his old friend who is now calling himself Halloween Jack and the two decided to take over Vegas. During this event Halloween Jack warped the city and became the king of his new kingdom but, Meanstreak decided to go back to the X-men. Meanstreak then went to break his remaining friends out of the theater of pain. During this time Xi'an was in a criminal rampage but, was snapped out of it. The president of that time who was doom made it so all of the <a href=\"/theatre-of-pain/4060-41423/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41423\">Theatre of Pain</a> prisoners would be able to live in a place called Halo city. The rest of the X-men went to live in Halo city where Meanstreak had become a patrol there. When Krystalin asked for help a group called the Zoomers tried to kill Xi'a. During this fight Meanstreak had reached high speeds but, the Zoomers kept up with him. He then tried to out race them but, reaching the speed of sound a energy field appeared and sucked him in. When this happened all the X-man had to leave <a href=\"/halo-city/4020-56003/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56003\">Halo City</a> and go to the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Lands</a>.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Eddie was a mutant in 2099 but, before joining the X men he was a musician. He made music from vibration waves and was very skilled. Eddie has the power to turn his skin into any metal he touches. When Eddie was playing at Xi’an Chi Xan's place Xi'an was shot so Eddie jumped in front of him and protected him.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Metalhead was created by John Francis Moore and Ron Lim and first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/x-men-2099-1-the-gathering/4000-105839/\">X-Men 2099 issue 1</a> (1993).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>With the X-Men</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/175464-17105-metalhead.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/175464-17105-metalhead.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/175464-17105-metalhead.jpg\"></a></figure><p>Later he also helped and joined the X-men out of a gun fight. He would then join Meanstreak and raided the Synge Corporation building to clear Xi'an's name of murder. But, Synge captured the two men. Then the X-men came and sved them and cleared Xi'an's name. Later, when the X-men heard from a lady named Mama Hurricane they went to capture her. When they found her they fought and had a brief talk with her. She told them she was the leader of a group called Freak Show. After that the X-men went to look for the mutant paradise called Avalon. But, Eddie discovered he had been infected by the team Freak Show and was trapped in his metal form. He decided to stay back with Rosalinda who still cared for him even if he was in his metal form.</p><h3>Freak Show</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1387591-300px_x_men_2099_vol_1_14__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1387591\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66839378238342\" data-width=\"193\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 193px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1387591-300px_x_men_2099_vol_1_14__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1387591\"><img alt=\"Metalhead in his transformed state\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1387591-300px_x_men_2099_vol_1_14__2_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1387591-300px_x_men_2099_vol_1_14__2_.jpg 193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px\" data-width=\"193\"></a><figcaption>Metalhead in his transformed state</figcaption></figure><p>So Eddie would join the team Freak Show. The Freak Show traveled to Oklahoma Hills to have help with Rosalinda baby. A man named Glitterspike said the baby was his but Eddie disagreed and fought him. Glitterspike had beat him and took Rosa and the baby. But, while flying away Rosa made him crash. Where they later found an alien named Shadow Dancer. Glitterspike had fought the alien while Rosa got away. Soon enough Eddie found and fought Glitterspike again but using a stronger metal. He defeated Glitterspike and left him with the alien. Later, it was revealed that Glitterspike had beaten the alien but, had his arm torn off. Now he fought Eddie again but, during the fight Rosa was having her baby and the baby used its power to protect his mother. When the baby came out it was glowing almost like Glitterspike did. Eddie and Rosa left to Halo city much later but, on the way they were being attacked and thats when Bloodhawk came a saved them. Bloodhawk stayed with them to keep them safe.</p><p> </p><p>Once they reached Halo city they thought they were safe. But, there was a man named Vulcann and he wanted to take Rosa's child. Vulcann had two red hounds attack Eddie and during the fight Eddie fell out of the window with one. Vulcann then called the other one off. Vulcann asked Rosa to give up the baby and with no other choice she did. Vulcann then took the baby and turned him into a adult and called him Darkson. When Rosa found Eddie she blamed him for losing their child. Until, Vulcan showed up again with their son at his side. Rosa didn't believe it was her son until she saw his eyes. Eddie attacked Darkson but, was thrown far away. Vulcann then asked Rosa to join him. When Eddie returned Rosa was gone. But, when Eddie went and found vulcann he attacked him. His attempt failed and Vulcann said he would kill Eddie until Rosa told Vulcann she would join him. Vulcann had tied him and the rest of the X-men to a drowning ship. Eddie was tied to a anchor. Thats when Bloodhawk cma eand lifted him and the anchor up and dropped Eddie on Vulcann. Eddie took Vulcann to the bottom of the ocean and left him there tied to the anchor. Skullfire showed up and told Darkson everything that happened. So the remaining X-men, Rosa, Darkson, and Eddie went to live on the last dry piece of land left called the Savage Land.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Originally, Metalhead had the ability to transform from a human form to a metal form with increased strength, durability, resistance to injury, and whatever specific properties that metal had (e.g. adamantium would give him invulnerability, copper would give him increased electrical conductivity, gold would be softer, etc) dependent upon a type of metal which he made contact with. However, after his battle with Contagion he was stuck in his hulking metallic form and incapable of reverting to human form. He was still capable of shifting the molecular composition of his skin though.</p><h2>Other media</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1386029-methed.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1386029\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1386029-methed.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1386029\"><img alt=\"Metalhead action figure from Toy Biz\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1386029-methed.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1386029-methed.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Metalhead action figure from Toy Biz\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1386029-methed.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75522/1386029-methed.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Metalhead action figure from Toy Biz</figcaption></figure><p>Metalhead was made into an action figure as part of the X-Men 2099 line.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Tim was a troubled mutant in 2099 until a mutant named Cerebra invited him to a gathering. When Tim got there he saw Xi'an and a bunch of other mutants. He discovered these mutants are different and nice.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Skullfire was created by John Francis Moore and Ron Lim and first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/x-men-2099-1-the-gathering/4000-105839/\">X-Men 2099 issue 1</a> (1993).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Finding a Murderer</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/150858-175060-skullfire.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/150858-175060-skullfire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/150858-175060-skullfire.jpg\"></a></figure><p>When he saw Xi'an going to make a speech someone tried to kill Xi'an so Tim shot a energy bolt at the man causing him to leave. It turned out to be by the The Synge Corporation who thought Xi'an had killed their leader and they sent another group to raid the gathering. Tim escaped with the hurt Xi'an with the other X-men. Xi'an then asked Tim to be apart of their team. Tim was unsure and stayed with Xi'an while he healed. Until, Junkpile attacked them and took Xi'an's body. Tim then went with the X-men to Synge Corporation building so they could help some of their captured teammates. While in the building Tim unleashed a giant blast which destroyed most of the Synge corporation men. While freeing their teammates they were confronted by Junkpile.</p><p>During the fight the X-men were having some trouble with Junkpile and Serpentina had been killed. Thats when Xi'an came up to Junkpile and disabled him. After that Tim trusted Xi'an and joined the X-men. Later, Tim joined Meanstreak to find Meanstreak's friend. During their quest La Lunatica captured them and tortured Tim by making him remember when he killed his girlfriend with his powers. This memory caused his powers to destroy their restraining collars. Luna then killed her master and let them go but Skullfire told her he would never forgive her. They continued the search when they found some answers in a hidden book. Ever since Tim was attacked by Luna he became suicidal but, also began to control his powers beter.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/150851-27002-skullfire.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/150851-27002-skullfire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/150851-27002-skullfire.jpg\"></a></figure><p>Around that time Tim started to call himself Skullfire. Xi'an than became more selfish and mean. Tim decided to go with Xi'an on a journey. While Xi'an was talking to a man Tim ran into lunatica. They started to fight but, then they started to kiss and they liked each other. Tim painted his face white to match her until she told him she betrayed him and brought him to Junkpile where he had no other choice but to help them. Thats when Tim found out that Xi'an betrayed him. Tim returned to the X-men and told the story. He then made himself the new leader. He also told them Luna was a new team member. While sleeping Xi'an put bomb with the X-men but they woke up in time to escape. Later after that in Halo City it appeared a being named Darkson had killed Tim. But, it turned out he didn't and that he had turned into one big being of energy. Tim went back and fought Darkson and disabled him. Tim returned home to his mom and took a ship to the Savage land.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Originally Skullfire was capable of absorbing all forms of ambient energy particles into his body where he metabolized it to a usable form and then dispersed it in destructive energy blasts. He had no control over this power though and was only capable of using it during moments of great stress. Cerebra's powers allowed her to trigger his powers at will, but she had to make physical contact with him. After La Lunatica made him relive Reiko's death, Timothy could control his powers at will. Absorbing the energy of Halo City's powerplants gave Timothy a permanent source of power, but as a side-effect he was constantly glowing with a green light. When his body was destroyed, Timothy existed as a small sphere of energy. Timothy managed to take a form that resembled his human form. He now was capable of levitation and could absorb and channel the energy around him with far more ease and control.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Little is known about Junkpile except his former affiliations and the hatred they produced in him towards the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>'s leader, Xi'an Chi Xan. When Xi'an was convicted of murdering casino boss Noah Synge, Junkpile jumped at the chance to get even. Junkpile and Xi'an were formerly members of an outlaw group known as the Lawless until Xi'an decided to \"go straight\" and clean up his act, leaving the group. During the skirmish that followed, Junkpile mercilessly killed <a href=\"/serpentina/4005-41449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41449\">Serpentina</a>--an elastic mutant who had joined the team--while he was trying to get to Xi'an.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Junkpile was created by John Francis Moore and Ron Lim and first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/x-men-2099-1-the-gathering/4000-105839/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men 2099 issue 1</a> (1993).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Alone</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/142548-147869-junkpile.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-142548\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.9275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/142548-147869-junkpile.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-142548\"><img alt=\"Junkpile\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/142548-147869-junkpile.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/142548-147869-junkpile.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Junkpile</figcaption></figure><p>Later, when Skullfire and La Lunatica set out on their own, Luna contacted Junkpile to help her stay safe from the hunters that the Theatre of Pain had set out to retrieve her. Skullfire had great difficulty with this partnership, as he still harbored feelings of resentment against the villain for killing Serpentina. The trio soon stumbled upon the lair of the Driver, a mysterious mutant smuggler from the old days, along with Xi'an. The Driver intended to transmute the DNA of the group into a data stream so that they could be preserved until a utopian golden age came, starting with Junkpile. The group was saved by the malevolent intervention of Brimstone Love, the leader of the Theatre of Pain. After being freed, Junkpile charged after the Driver, who commanded his car to ram Junkpile. The car has the ability to phase through solid objects, and upon phasing through Junkpile, caused a seizure in him. Junkpile started telekinetically pulling all pieces of machinery, including the Driver's computer, towards him, destroying the data of all the mutants that the Driver had stored. Xi'an used his healing powers to restore Junkpile, but only so that he would owe him a favor in the future.</p><p>His disassembled body was found months later by President Doom and Morphine Somers, who wanted to use the mutant as a weapon against the X-Men. They put him back together and offered him a membership to <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a>, giving him complete autonomy to do his bidding. Junkpile jumped at this chance and formed a squad called the Junkyard Dogs to attack the X-Men. Instead of going after his enemies, he found his way to Death Valley, where, trapped with Skullfire, actually teamed up with his hated enemy in order to escape the machinations of the Theatre of Pain.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Junkpile has a unique techno-organic physiology which allows him to construct his body entirely out of metal. This grants him with increased strength, stamina, and resistance to physical injury. He also has telekinetic abilities so that he can draw and bond metal objects to himself to add to his body or rebuild himself when destroyed.</p>",

They subjected him to the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">Adamantium</a> bonding process, bonding the nigh-indestructible metal to his bones. During the experiment, some the Adamantium managed to accumulate in Desjardins' arms and manifested itself as razor-sharp spikes that protruded from his hands and elbows. When his sedatives wore off, Guy - now known as Weapon X - went berserk and slaughtered several Weapon X employees until he was able to be drugged back into sedation. Weapon X proved to be too uncontrollable for his creators' use and rather than deal with their new monster, the Weapon X project head had Weapon X shipped off to <a href=\"/department-h/4060-59050/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59050\">Department H</a> with merely the instructions: \"His code-name is Weapon X. Make use of him.\"</p><p>Against <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sasquatch/4005-1478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1478\">Doctor Langkowski</a>'s wishes, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/guardian/4005-5047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5047\">Doctor James Hudson</a> decided to take in Weapon X out of sympathy for the tormented being, as well as being a possible recruit for the new would-be Canadian superteam known as <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">The Flight</a>. As the team was training, Weapon X broke loose and killed Langkowski, prompting Hudson to call in the team despite their lack of full training. Escaping, Weapon X made his way to the city of Kenora where he went on a rampage, killing the husband of a friend of Logan. He swore revenge for the sake of his former friend and his grieving widow.</p><p>The Flight was deployed to stop Weapon X. <a href=\"/stitch/4005-26324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26324\">Stitch</a> attempted to use her powers to deactivate the harness that supplied Weapon X with adrenaline, but she got too close and was impaled on his spikes. While Doctor Hudson went to get the <a href=\"/groundhog/4005-59804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59804\">Groundhog</a> armor so that he could help in the fight, <a href=\"/smart-alec/4005-14564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14564\">Smart Alec</a> tried to stop Weapon X by disconnecting him from his harness. He was partially successful, but his thought that doing so would shut down Weapon X failed when his body managed to compensate for the loss of artificial adrenaline and he killed Smart Alec.</p><p>As Weapon X continued on his killing spree, Logan discovered Department H's ties to the Weapon X program and confronted its head officials. He downloaded their files onto a disc and vowed to expose them all for creating Weapon X and their hand in unleashing the relentless killer on the innocent public.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3243083\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3243083-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-hrrrrr.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.0086455331412\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3243083-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-hrrrrr.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3243083\"><img alt=\"Weapon X in a frenzy.\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3243083-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-hrrrrr.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3243083-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-hrrrrr.jpg 347w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px\" data-width=\"634\"></a><figcaption>Weapon X in a frenzy.</figcaption></figure><p>Having regrouped, The Flight confronted Weapon X again, now in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/calgary/4020-57972/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57972\">Calgary</a>. <a href=\"/st-elmo/4005-26323/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26323\">St. Elmo</a> grabbed Weapon X and flew him into the air to deal with him, but Weapon X knocked him out, causing them both to plummet to the ground. Weapon X landed relatively safely, but St. Elmo wound up getting impaled on the cross on a church's roof. Furious, <a href=\"/snowbird/4005-8474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8474\">Snowbird</a> transformed into a polar bear and rushed at Weapon X. Slashing her to bits, Weapon X wound up getting whacked away by Doctor Hudson who was now wearing the Groundhog armor. The unperfected suit was much too slow however and Hudson was soon killed as well, the dream of The Flight dying with him.</p><p>Logan then finally arrived on the scene, wielding an impressive arsenal. A fierce battle broke out between Logan and Weapon X. The two berserkers were quite evenly matched, but Logan was able to leash in his animal side and out-thought Weapon X by removing his armor and decapitating him with a sword. Government agents then stepped in to arrest Logan for his theft of government records, but he dove into a nearby river, disappearing from their view. Given the amount of blood he'd lost in the fight, the agents believed Logan to have died. Days later, the proof of the government's involvement in creating Weapon X and their link to Department H was all over the news. As Logan watched this on TV while he recovered from his injuries, he gave a toast to the friend whose death he'd avenged.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3243080\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3243080-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-edited.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.69178082191781\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3243080-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-edited.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3243080\"><img alt=\"Desjardins' Adamantium spikes.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3243080-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-edited.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3243080-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-edited.jpg 438w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3243080-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-edited.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Desjardins' Adamantium spikes.\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3243080-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-edited.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3243080-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-edited.jpg 438w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3243080-guy_desjardins-what_if%2362-wolverine_battled_weapon_x-edited.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Desjardins' Adamantium spikes.</figcaption></figure><p>Guy Desjardins was a normal human, albeit in peak physical condition with extensive combat training. He did not possess a healing factor, but still survived the Adamantium bonding process nonetheless. His Adamantium-coated bones made him very tough, and excess amounts of this metal created spikes that protruded from his arms - three at each hand and one on the end of each elbow. These spikes were immensely sharp, but were more suited to stabbing rather than cutting like Wolverine's claws.</p><p>Desjardins was outfitted with cybernetic armor designed to control him. Unable to do this, it instead supplied him with either a continuous stream of sedatives to keep him unconscious or adrenaline to keep him in a berserker frenzy. This armor provided him a small degree of protection from attacks and the adrenaline stream coming from it most likely augmented his stamina and reflexes to be on par with Wolverine's.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The L'Angell family is a dark one, full of twists and turns and kinks. It extends from the deepest swamps to the highest echelons of power.  They go back generations, and put great stock in tradition - except in times of war, all the men were preachers.  The women were considered to be breed mares for the production of more sons.  Family elders arranged marriages and imposed absolute control over the raising of the offspring.</p><p>In the late 1990s, the chief of this black and wicked family was Marie L'Angell, a woman so despicable and cruel that she was unable to marry until she was over fifty.  It is believed that she had her husband killed after the birth of her daughter.</p><p>Her daughter shamed her by running away from their family home, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41399\" href=\"/angelville/4020-41399/\" slug=\"angelville\">Angelville</a>, when she was a young woman.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10537\" href=\"/christina-custer/4005-10537/\" slug=\"christina-custer\">Christina Custer</a> managed to escape her family with the intention of never returning to it again.  This was perhaps part of the reason why she became lovers with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10548\" href=\"/john-custer/4005-10548/\" slug=\"john-custer\">John Custer</a> as soon as she did - he was good, decent and honorable, everything her family was not, and a chance to give up the very name that she despised.</p><p>Christina's family found her, however.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>A New Family</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-10529\" href=\"/jody/4005-10529/\" slug=\"jody\">Jody</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41303\" href=\"/tc/4005-41303/\" slug=\"tc\">T.C.</a>, two of Marie L'Angell's chief henchmen, tracked Christina down in Texas, and forced her, John and their young son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\" slug=\"jesse-custer\">Jesse Custer</a> to return to Angelville.  Marie imposed strict conditions on them: they would marry and live as a proper family.  Jesse would be groomed to be a man of God.  They would never leave Angelville, and should they be tempted to try, the punishment for John Custer would be death.</p><p>A year later, John Custer was dead, and Marie L'Angell had complete control over her daughter and grandson.  She gave Jesse presents when he was good an imposed terrible punishments when he was bad.  When he was seven, she began to teach him about God.  To his eyes, the God of Marie L'Angell was a fearsome creature, but he soon learned that his grandmother wasn't interested in his opinion, only that he learn to love the Lord.  He learned that, and he learned not to cross his grandmother.</p><p>His most terrible lesson in that regard came when he was caught cursing at Jody for having killed Jesse's dog.  Marie heard the language and set his punishment at a week in the coffin.</p><p>The coffin was just that - an airtight coffin fit with an air hose that would be sunk to the bottom of the swamp, with Jesse inside.  It was a horrible punishment for any violation, and Christina Custer wasn't about to let that happen to her son.  She tried to stop her mother, but was dragged away by Jody.</p><p>Marie L'Angell had done the simple math: there was a child already.  There was no longer any need for its mother.  The fact that she was Marie's daughter never entered into the equation.</p><p>Jesse spent a week in the coffin, and never saw his mother again.  He tried to be on his best behavior, and succeeded until he was sixteen, when he went in the coffin again.  T.C. had killed Jesse's friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41332\" href=\"/billy-bob-bobbs/4005-41332/\" slug=\"billy-bob-bobbs\">Billy-Bob Bobbs</a>, and Jesse called T.C. a cocksucker.  For that, and not for the fistfight Jesse tried to have with Jody, Jesse spent a fortnight in the coffin.</p><p>When he recovered, he went to talk to Billy-Bob's family about the boy's death, and never returned to Angelville.</p><p>Marie L'Angell was understandably furious.  She started to use her family resources to track down her errant grandson, and once again sent out her bloodhounds, T.C. and Jody.  They found him in Phoenix, AZ.  He was happy and in love with a woman named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10525\" href=\"/tulip/4005-10525/\" slug=\"tulip\">Tulip</a>, whom he hoped to marry.</p><p>Jody and T.C. told him that if he came back to Angelville with them, the girl wouldn't be killed.</p><p>Jesse spent a month in the coffin.</p><p>After that, he was his grandmother's tool.  He became a preacher.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>The Prodigal Returns</h2><p>She sent Jesse to a small town, where he became the preacher for the parish of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41398\" href=\"/annville-texas/4020-41398/\" slug=\"annville-texas\">Annville, Texas</a>.  When the church blew up, taking most of the parishioners with it, she suspected the worst, and once again sent for word.</p><p>Help came in an unexpected form - <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10526\" href=\"/god/4005-10526/\" slug=\"god\">God</a>.</p><p>God appeared to Marie L'Angell and promised to help her find her grandson.  What's more, he gave her and all those who worked for her resistance to Jesse's newfound Voice of Command.</p><p>Powerless and terrified, Jesse allowed himself and Tulip to be taken back to Angelville by Jody and T.C. Once there, Marie L'Angell ordered Jesse's last extra-familial loyalty to be cut - she had Jody shoot Tulip dead right before Jesse's eyes.</p><p>He was beaten.  His Voice didn't work, and the woman he loved was dead.  As far as Marie was concerned, all that he had to do now was get some girl pregnant and she could be done with the whole mess.</p><p>God, however, had different plans.  He resurrected Tulip and restored the power of Jesse's Voice over the family.  Jesse, with the help of his imaginary friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10555\" href=\"/john-wayne/4005-10555/\" slug=\"john-wayne\">John Wayne</a>, pulled himself together and went to deal with his grandmother's henchmen.  In the course of killing them, he set the house on fire, and on her way out of the house, Tulip kicked over Marie L'Angell's wheelchair.  All that was needed then was for the flames to reach her oxygen tanks.</p><p>Marie L'Angell, along with all of her evil hopes and dreams and plans, perished in flames.  Another would later try to avenge her death, but the horrible old woman who ruled Angelville was gone forever.</p>",

They were about the same age, and spent as much time as they could together, fishing, hunting or just hanging out.</p><p>Like most things in Jesse's life, though, it didn't last. When Billy-Bob was sixteen, he had the misfortune of being in the barn when <a href=\"/tc/4005-41303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41303\">T.C.</a>, an employee/henchman of Jesse's grandmother, decided to get amorous with a chicken. T.C. found Billy-Bob hiding nearby and slit his throat. Billy-Bob managed to get out of the barn, and died at Jesse's feet.</p>",

Leaving aside its magnetic attraction for homosexuals, the city has somehow acquired a reputation for licentious behavior that good, God-fearing Americans should have nothing to do with.</p><p>For all that these Americans fear God, they would be terrified of Jesus DeSade.</p><p>DeSade's business is pleasure, in every form and combination. Nothing is forbidden, everything is permitted, and the more forbidden a pleasure is, the more pleasure will be taken from it. His wealth and status among the elite class of America allowed him to pursue his passions.</p><p>Naturally, he held amazing parties.</p><p>One of these parties was crashed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\" slug=\"jesse-custer\">Jesse Custer</a>, his girlfriend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10525\" href=\"/tulip/4005-10525/\" slug=\"tulip\">Tulip</a> and their friend, the vampire <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10527\" href=\"/cassidy/4005-10527/\" slug=\"cassidy\">Cassidy</a>. Cassidy's girlfriend had died of a heroin overdose, and they tracked the men who'd sold it to her to DeSade's mansion. They arrived to find an orgy of epic proportions.</p><p>The three were followed by agents of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41404\" href=\"/the-grail/4060-41404/\" slug=\"the-grail\">The Grail</a>, who were trying to capture Jesse Custer for use in their plans, and their gunfire put an end to the party very quickly. For DeSade, however, the party ended under the fists of Jesse Custer.</p><p>Custer discovered that DeSade was filming pornography with a young boy. Custer proceeded to beat DeSade's face to a pulp. When DeSade's assistant, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41334\" href=\"/harcourt/4005-41334/\" slug=\"harcourt\">Harcourt</a>, pointed a gun, Jesse used his Voice of Command to make the man eat it. Then he commanded the female porn model to tell the police about the party and to take care of the young boy for the rest of her life. While leaving the scene we see a crying Harcourt trying to chew his own gun, breaking teeth and damaging his jaw in the process.</p><p>DeSade's current whereabouts are unknown but based on Jesse's words, it is assumed he went to jail.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Billy Baker knew he'd never really put Vietnam behind him.  Few veterans did.  But when he found himself with the son of one of his best friends from the war, it all came back to him hard.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\">Jesse Custer</a> was the spitting image of his father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10548\" href=\"/john-custer/4005-10548/\">John Custer</a>, and Billy Baker, known to his friends as \"Spaceman,\" had a great chance to tell a young man about his long-dead father.</p><p>In the late '60s, Spaceman was in the thick of 'Nam.  Those on the ground knew it was a lost cause, but the brass wouldn't hear of it.  They tortured themselves with the thought of measuring up to their fathers' honorable service in an honorable war.   The air was heavy with humidity, the mosquitoes as big as helicopters, and every day was a chance of being shot dead by an unknown adversary in the trees.  In that world, friends were a soldier's greatest asset, and John Custer - known to his buddies as \"Texas\" - was Spaceman's greatest friend.</p><p>They experienced horrors in that place, and lost a lot of good friends.  Their last days in country were days of terror.</p><p>Baker was wounded by enemy fire, and he and Custer lost their transportation back to base.  They were a long way from safety, and only forty days and a wake-up from home.  Surrender, of course, was out of the question. So together, they made their way through the jungle.  Custer, who hadn't been wounded, helped Baker every step of the way, refusing to let him quit.  Even on the edge of suicide, Custer wouldn't let his friend down and together they found their way to safety.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>In the dead of the night, they stumbled upon a VC sneak attack in the middle of a minefield outside a U.S. base.  They foiled the attack, but got shot and wounded in the process.  They both spent a long time in the hospital, finished their tours in easy postings, and Custer got the Congressional Medal of Honor.</p><p>Spaceman never saw his friend again, and never knew what had happened to him.  Thanks to Jesse, though, he was able to put his friend to rest and give a young man some memories of a father he had lost so long ago.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Frankie Toscani was an active member of the Toscani crime family in New York City.  He was involved in a feud with some Russian mobsters working out of Coney Island, and hit them pretty hard.  So the Russians decided to hit back.</p><p>They seduced Frankie with a beautiful woman, and knocked him unconscious.  When he awoke, he was tied to a chair and naked.  A large Russian man was holding garden shears and a big smile, and told him they were sending a message to the Toscani family.  Then he cut off Frankie's penis.</p><p>When he got out of the hospital, Frankie implored his father to avenge his mutilation, but the elder Toscani wouldn't have it.  He made some excuses about how the Russians were too strong, or it wasn't the right time, but the truth was that his son had been unmanned.  And a disgrace to the Toscani family.</p><p>After that, Frankie was an outcast.  The only person who talked to him was his sister, who taunted him by calling him names such as \"Eunochio.\"  So Frankie shot her husband, which caused even more bad blood.  Eventually, he left the country and started doing freelance jobs.</p><p>That's how he ended up at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41400\" href=\"/masada/4020-41400/\">Masada</a>, the headquarters of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41404\" href=\"/the-grail/4060-41404/\">The Grail</a>.  He was contacted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10528\" href=\"/starr/4005-10528/\">Starr</a>, the Grail's Sacred Executioner, who had a special project for Frankie.  Starr had captured a vampire named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10527\" href=\"/cassidy/4005-10527/\">Cassidy</a>, who was exceedingly difficult to kill.  He wanted Frankie to go into the holding area with his gun, and see just how much punishment the vampire could take.</p><p>Frankie reveled in the job.  He brought an authentic Lee-Enfield bolt action rifle, the treasure of his collection, and took casual shots at Cassidy, blowing off bits and pieces at his leisure.</p><p>When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\">Jesse Custer</a> arrived to rescue his friend, Frankie was prepared.  Starr had told him all about Custer's Voice of Command, and was ready to shoot as soon as Jesse said a single word.  Unfortunately, the word Jesse used was, \"Miss.\"</p><p>Frankie missed the shot, and Jesse knocked him down into the pit where he had been shooting Cassidy.  His neck broke, all Toscani could do was lie there while Cassidy drank his blood to replenish his strength.</p>",

His body was taken down and hidden away. Three days later, he awoke from his sleep, alive and healthy. The legend of the resurrection and ascension into Heaven were put about to hide his escape, and they were believable enough.</p><p>Christ went on to live with his wife, Mary, and their children. At the age of forty-eight, he was run over by an offal cart and then, in fact, died.</p><p>The bloodline of Christ, however, was considered divine, and a group was set up to guard it. That group became known as The Grail. Over two thousand years, they carefully preserved the bloodline of Christ, making sure it was not tainted by impurity. In practice, this meant a prodigious amount of inbreeding. The final descendant was an idiot in every sense of the word, but he had the paperwork to prove his divinity. The plan was for The Grail to start a global nuclear war in the year 2000, and then stop the war, presenting the Messiah as the savior of the planet.</p><p>In truth, The Grail would then rule the world, and the Messiah could be conveniently dismissed.</p><p>Many of the Grail faithful believed that the Messiah would truly save the world, overlooking his obvious flaws. But a few, including the Grail's Sacred Executioner, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10528\" href=\"/starr/4005-10528/\" slug=\"starr\">Starr</a>, knew exactly what he was, and that he could not be allowed to live.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/667630-002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667630\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2757575757576\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/667630-002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667630\"><img alt=\"His ultimate fate\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/667630-002.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/667630-002.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" data-width=\"501\"></a><figcaption>His ultimate fate</figcaption></figure> <p>Starr planned to use <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\" slug=\"jesse-custer\">Jesse Custer</a>, a young man from America with the power of Command, as a new Messiah.

He is a truly massive man. He is so big that The Grail spends about sixty million dollars a year in airplane repairs alone - large aircraft can't land at The Grail's base at <a href=\"/masada/4020-41400/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41400\">Masada</a>, and the Allfather gets sick in helicopters. So the small aircraft that ferry him about inevitably sustain damage landing.</p><p>Oddly enough, he is also bulemic.</p><p>Looking at him, with his nearly spherical body and vomit on his chin, one might get the impression that he's stupid. Most of the people who had that impression are now dead. His corpulence hides a mind as sharp as diamond and a soul as cold as ice. He came to Masada with the horribly inbred Messiah to confront his Sacred Executioner, <a href=\"/starr/4005-10528/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10528\">Starr</a>, about Starr's plan to use <a href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\">Jesse Custer</a> in the upcoming Armageddon. Starr's plan was, of course, unorthodox to the point of heresy, although Custer's power was certainly of interest. D'Aronique had a more personal reason to want Custer, though.</p><p>Jesse Custer had killed D'Aronique's aunt, <a href=\"/marie-langell/4005-41328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41328\">Marie L'Angelle</a>.</p><p>The L'Angell branch of the family had left France two centuries previously, though they and the D'Aroniques had kept in touch. Marie L'Angell had kept her nephew appraised of her grandson's progress, writing of her hopes for him and her pride. Then the letters stopped coming. The Allfather sent Grail investigators to look for the truth, and that truth pointed directly towards Jesse Custer, who had killed his grandmother.</p><p>D'Aronique saw a solution to both of his problems. He put Starr in a knife duel with Custer, planning to kill the victor.

The journey of self realization was so traumatic her demonic persona came to a life of its own and Lady Death became Lady Demon.</p><p>The demonic being cast <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42482\" href=\"/purgatori/4005-42482/\">Purgatori</a> out of Hell and back to Earth, much to her torment and dismay. Lady Demon became <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49221\" href=\"/lucifer/4005-49221/\">Lucifer</a>'s consort for a short time until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-60734\" href=\"/marion/4005-60734/\">Marion</a>, Lady Death's mother, came to her making Lady Death come to her senses. Lady Death absorbed her mother's angelic powers to return to battle Lucifer. In the end Lady Death casts Lucifer through the Nexus and into the gates of heaven.</p><p>As she accustoms to being Lady Demon she travels Hell to see its wonders. She is accompanied by Lucifer, or is saved by him from time to time; like when Lady Demon found <a data-ref-id=\"4055-47001\" href=\"/spear-of-destiny/4055-47001/\">Spear of Destiny</a> in Hell and tried to claim it as her own. She was stopped by Lucifer as touching it would have killed her. One time <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53540\" href=\"/matthias/4005-53540/\">Matthias</a> tries to trick Lady Demon to release him but she sees through his deception and lets him rot in his chains.</p><p>Later Lady Demon came to exist as a being on her own with dark intent. She sought out Lady Death to combine with her once more, only to fail. Lady Demon escaped Lady Death's wrath by merging with a mortal woman by the name of Cheryl Montessori. Cheryl was a co-op agent. After the merging with the mortal; Lady Demon was able to escape hell. Cheryl managed to survive along with Lady Demon and they both struggled for the body's control.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/421115-Boris Vallejo - Lady Demon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421115\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 602px\" data-ratio=\"1.4036544850498\" data-width=\"602\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/421115-Boris Vallejo - Lady Demon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421115\"><img alt=\"Lady Demon\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/421115-Boris+Vallejo+-+Lady+Demon.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/421115-Boris+Vallejo+-+Lady+Demon.jpg 602w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/421115-Boris+Vallejo+-+Lady+Demon.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Lady Demon</figcaption></figure><p>After the Armageddon Lady Demon is recreated still fighting to control the body she inhabits. She woke as Cheryl beside a body, and soon after that government soldiers from ETC stormed in her door. Lady Demon took over and fled that place killing as many men she could. She again turns back to Cheryl to rest. Lady Demon has a weakness though, when she merged with a mortal, she made herself vulnerable; she was gunned down by the mafia on the street and then taken captive. The warehouse where she was kept in was raided by ETC, which only served as a distraction to escape her bonds to Lady Demon. Cheryl looks a way to get both the Mob and ETC off her back.</p><p>Lady Demon and Cheryl had a final fight over the body, Cheryl agreed to release Lady Demon freely, and let her kill as many enemies she wants. They then go to see Vittorio, old love of Cheryl. But Vittorio knows Lady Demon is inside Cheryl and calls her out, he then proposes that she'd work for him and he could arrange an operation that would give her total control over the body. While Lady Demon and Vittorio are discussing the details, ETC attacks the restaurant they are in. Lady Demon fights both sides and comes out as victor. But Cheryl has decides to rid herself of Lady Demon, she threatens to kill herself (that would also kill Lady Demon) if she don't leave her body. Lady Demon curses Cheryl and leaves her body, she starts to look for a new body to inhabit, otherwise she would be pulled back to Hell. She finds one woman who has killed her husband and then herself. This body suits Lady Demon better than the last one.</p>",

Aspen and Sara break out of the machine, helping Lara to save Cannon and battle the Arctic Blue. While Sara battles Biranha while Lara helping Cannon, Vana tries to freeze Aspen, but she breaks the icicle off of her and stabs Vana's chest. With Cannon free from Vana's wraith, Taras' body (which had been using Cannon's body to grow) died and Vana went mad with grief and died, destroying the entire base in blast of ice.</p><p><em><ins><strong>Note:</strong></ins> </em> On the definitive edition of Fathom, this version has changed since Michael Turner's departure from Top Cow so 3 issues have been remastered with Aspen, Vana and Cannon only.</p><h2>Return</h2><p>Vana was soon to be alive during the aftermath of resurrecting Taras.

He is immune to fires and electricity, and used to being in charge of vast demon armies.</p><p>Ertuu was around when the wizards first created the Crystal Shard and he had hoped to gain it for himself, but the wizards lust for power was too great. In finishing the creation of te crystal shard all the wizards present were killed and thier life force (magic) drained into the shard. Ertuu was destroyed, but since he was on the martial plane he was only banished back to the Abyss.</p><p>Ertuu waited years for the Shard to re-surface, and once it did he set his plans to aquire the shard once again. He planned to take the shard from Akar Kessel, but his powerwas too great while he possessed the Crystal Shard. They then made a deal that when Kessels life was over Ertuu would be given the shard. Ertuu agreed and then became leader of Kessel's armies. They gahtered orcs and giants alike to raid the Ten Towns.</p><p>This is where Ertuu first meets the dark elf Drizzt. Who outsmarts the demon and sends him back to the Abyss where he has to wait a century to take his avenge.</p>",

    "deck": "Last in line of the Battlehammers of Mithril Hall. He is lord over the dwarves in exile in Icewind Dale. He has a gruff exterior, but a soft heart, as is proved by his taking orphans into his care.",
    "description": "<p>Above the Spine of the World mountain range in the northwestern corner of Faerun lies the wide valley known as Icewind Dale. Originally settled by rogues with no where else to go centuries before, the Dale now boasted ten villages, collectively known as Ten-Towns. Each of the ten villages made their livelihood through fishing for the knucklehead trout which lived in abundance in the several lakes of the Dale. Good for food, the knucklehead troat was also the sole source of bone for the Dale's other well-known export, scrimshaw.</p><p>Dominating the landscape of the Dale is the sole mountain in the grand valley, a craggy peak known as Kelvin's Cairn. Many of the ten villages had been built with their back to the mountain, allowing it to form a natural barrier between the individual settlements, and forming a last resort of defense from the orc and giant hoards found in the northern reaches. Down below the mass of Kelvin's Cairn, lies another unseen settlement, unknown to the casual observer. The Battlehammer clan of dwarves, in exile from their traditional home of Mithril Hall. Bruenor Battlehammer is ruler over the dwarves of Icewind Dale, and known for his stubbornness. Beneath his gruff exterior is a kind heart, as is proved by his taking in of the young the young fostering, Cattie-Brie. Cattie-Brie's parents had been killed during a gobllin raid when she was just a toddler, and Bruenor had shown a compassion uncommon among his kind, taking in a human. A few weeks after Drizzt arrives in the Dale, Cattie begs to be let outside, her human spirit stifled by halls meant for dwarven sensibilities. Against his better judgment, Bruenor acquiesces, and allows her to go out for a time.</p> Cattie goes outside, and quickly runs across Drizzt Do'urden and his great panther, Guenhwyvar. For the first time in years, Drizzt is not met with instant fear and prejudice. Though wary because of all the stories she had heard about drow, Cattie does not run away, but remains open with the curiosity of a child. Making instant friends with Guenhwyvar, Cattie-Brie speaks with Drizzt for a short time, and then runs back home before her father can get worried for her safety. Drizzt knew he had made a new friend, and he hoped that the friendship would open other doors as well.<p>Meanwhile, Bruenor himself had just learned of the presence of the drow elf from the spokesman of Bryn Shander, Cassius. Fearing for the safety of his daughter, Bruenor forbids Cattie from going out on the Cairn again without his express permission. She tries to tell Bruenor she had already met the elf and trusted him, but was unable to do so, and was cowed into promising him she would not go onto the mountain again. During an uncharacteristic mid-winter thaw, Cattie=Brie realizes she could keep her promise to Bruenor by staying on the paths that skirted Kelvin's Cairn, and then call out for Drizzt. Bruenor never told her not to contact the elf, just to stay off the Cairn. Every few weeks, Cattie would venture out of the dwarven caves, looking for her new friend. They passed the winter, their relationship growing ever more closer.</p><br /> For his part, Bruenor had vowed to confront the dark elf as soon as the winter snows began to recede. He had never met a dark elf himself, but he knew their reputation, and would no longer suffer such a dangerous foe so close to home. While climbing the Cairn and looking for the drow, Bruenor is attacked by an ice worm, one of the huge dragon-like creatures that inhabit the Dale. Though he is initially caught by surprise and knocked down, Bruenor quickly gets the upper hand with his battle axe, cleaving the head of the beast cleanly. Up above, Drizzt is silently watching. When Bruenor sees him standing there, he calls out to Drizzt, calling him a vile creature. Disappointed in the dwarf after spending so much time with Cattie, Drizzt's initial reaction is to give in to his anger and allow the hunter to come and deal with the dwarven king. Drizzt's true nature, the individual Mielikki spoke to in his heart, won the day, and so Drizzt slowly turned and walked away. The dark elf's departure confused Bruenor, and flew in the face of all he had ever heard of the drow species. Bruenor convinced himself that the being must not be a drow after all.<p>A few weeks later, Drizzt's enemy, Roddy McGristle enters Icewind Dale. Somehow, he had been able to track Drizzt from Lurkwood all the way to Bryn Shander. From there, he was able to follow the clues to the throne room of Clan Battlehammer. Bruenor, still not  believing he had encountered a drow, says he had not seen a dark elf. In addition, he states that, <b><i>\"If yer drow's about, he's been no bother.\"</i></b> McGristle goes into his usual diatribe about how Drizzt attacked and killed the Thistledown family, killed one of his dogs, and scarred his face. To these accusations, Cattie-Brie calls McGristle a liar, and then Bruenor throws the ugly human out of his Hall for upsetting his daughter. After Roddy is gone,  Bruenor turns on his daughter and yells, <b><i>\"Ye've been to the mountain and seen the drow, haven't ye? Ye've disobeyed me! And now we learn the dark elf's a killer!\"</i></b></p><p>Disbeleiving the accusations, Cattie-Brie runs out into the winter snows to confront Drizzt, and tells him of Roddy and the rumors of the Thistledown family. <b><i>\"So that story has followed me event to the end of the world.\"</i></b> Drizzt is shocked, but not surprised, and as they discuss the situation further, Drizzt realizes that his troubles will not soon end. He sends Cattie-Brie home, telling her not to fear for his own safety. At that moment, Drizzt decides he has no wish to further battle Roddy, and so decides to leave Icewind Dale. As Cattie is headed home, she is assaulted by Roddy, who has followed her and seen her with Drizzt. He threatens her and tells her she will take him to Drizzt, but he drow appears behind him suddenly and says, <b><i>\"Let the girl go, McGristle.\"</i></b> After a brief, but heated exchange, Roddy lets Cattie go, and attacks Drizzt. Easily evading the brutish attack, Drizzt succeeds in knocking the hunter down, and has the man at his mercy. Instead of choosing to strike the bigot down, he slams his scimitar's pommels against Roddy's temples, knocking him unconscious. Drizzt leaves him lying in the snow. Hours later, Cattie-Brie brings Bruenor to where Roddy lay. He tells Roddy that he should not have touched Cattie, and furthermore should not caller her a liar. He takes a leg from the hunter's remaining dog as revenge. McGristle and his now three legged dog left the Dale and never returned, neither did he ever bother Drizzt again.</p> Bruenor then climbs Kelvin Cairn and finally meets Drizzt face to face. He tells the drow, <b><i>\"All my life I been told drow are evil. But then one comes to my valley, and worse, me own daughter goes to him! She tells me he has a good heart, and I see in her eyes she's speakin' true, what then? I thought I knew, thought I had it all figured out, but I didn't know nothin'...but ye be keepin' yer eyes on me girl if she's so orc-headed as to keep visitin' ye! Be knowin' that I hold yerself responsible for her safety!\"</i></b> Unsure at first what to make of the dwarf's tirade, Drizzt eventually realized that Bruenor had accepted him. The dark elf decided he would not leave Icewind Dale. After nearly two decade, Drizzt had finally come home.<p>Five years pass, and Drizzt has been accepted by Bruenor Battlehammer and his foster-daughter Cattie-Brie, and that acceptance has given Drizzt the ability to walk freely down the streets of the villages of Ten-Towns. Though he is mistrusted still by many of the locals, they too have accepted his presence, though somewhat warily. Drizzt has found a home, and he would do everything necessary to protect it.</p><p>Life was hard in the frozen tundra north of the Spine of the World mountain range, and the only civilization evident were there the ten settlements, Lonelywood, Termaline, Caer Konig, Caer Dinival, Bremen, Targos, Easthaven, Dougan's Hole, Good Mead, and the largest, Bryn Shander.  The local economy was dependent upon the abundant knucklehead trout found in cold lakes. Besides being the primary source of food for trade and their own tables, the head bones of the trout were carved into intricate designs by local scrimshanders. Just north of Ten-Towns, lay the Dwarven Vale, and the mines of Clan Battlehammer. Trade between the humans and the dwarves was an important feature of life in the Dale. Even further north, above the Reghed Glacier, lay the homes of the Barbarian tribes who viewed their neighbors to the south with contempt. From his perch at the top of Bruenor's Climb, Drizzt Do'urden looked down on it all.</p> For his part, Drizzt still fought how the sunlight burned his eyes, even after so many years on the surface. The winter snows exaserbated the condition, but Drizzt would not let that deter him from protecting the Dale with all his heart, strength and skill. Among the duties he placed upon himself was the tracking down of the dangerous tundra yeti that roamed the snow drifts looking for local citizens to use as food. Drizzt did his best to thin the herd and keep the beasts away from the villages. On one particular day, while on his way to meet Bruenor, he is assaulted by two of the yeti, and only escapes certain death because of the timely intervention of the Battlehammer king. Unknown to the pair, Beorg and Heafstagg, clan chiefs of two the Barbarian tribes to the north, have called all the tribes together in preparation for a full scale assault on Ten-Towns.<p>Drizzt and Bruenor arrive at the dwarf's throne room and begin discussing how to go about rediscovering Clan Battlehammer's ancestral home, Mithril Hall. Drizzt agrees that someday they will find it, but for now more pressing matters required their attention. Drizzt has seen the Barbarians moving southward banging their war drums. <b><i>\"If Ten-Towns doesn't unite against them, the people are doomed.\"</i></b> Bruenor sees that they will need his people's help to win the battle, but he refuses to do so if the towns remain divided. He will not throw away his people's lives in a futile effort. If necessary, he will seal the entrances to Clan Battlehammer's halls and wait for the bloodshed to be over.</p><br /> Drizzt suggests that they get Regis to use both his position as spokesman of Lonelywood and his magic ruby pendant to bring the other nine spokesmen together for the defense of the people. Bryn Shander was the capitol of Ten-Towns, and so the Council gathered together. If Regis could get the two spokesmen of Targos and Termalaine to agree, the others would all fall in line. This was a near impossible task, as the two towns were the most prosperous of the area, and therefore fierce competitors. As the spokesmen on the Council argued among themselves and called one another liars, Regis stood up on the table to adress them. Though uncomfortable with using the ruby pendant in such a way, he knew that they survival of Ten-Towns was at stake, so he used the gem on Kemp of Targos, bringing him unwittingly into agreement with Agorwal of Termalaine. The alliance of Ten-Towns was assured, at least until after the battle was over.       Soon, Drizzt began tracking the Barbarians as they moved out of the snow-covered passes and into the wider valled of the Dale. He reported back often on the tribes' progress, going directly to Cassius and the other spokesmen of the Council. Though Kemp and a few others still treated him with disdain, the others at least accepted him as an ally and a much needed resource if they were to keep tabs on events as they unfolded. As some of the villages are evacuated to Bryn Shander, Drizzt proposes a trap. A smaller group of Barbarians rush into the deserted town of Termalaine and are ambushed by a group of archers and warriors. It was a slaughter, the Barbarians falling dead to the ground before they could even brandish their weapons.<p>Meanwhile, the larger force of Barbarians surrounds Bryn Shander, believing the siege would be short lived. Caught between the combined armies of Ten-Towns inside the walls, and Bruenor's dwarven warriors combined with Bryn Shander's warriors on the outside, the northern tribes held no chance for survival. In the middle of it all were the blindingly fast blades of Drizzt, a seeming force of nature against which the Barbarians fled like frightened children. Until he was caught from behind with a mace to the ribs.</p><br /> Nearby, Heafstagg finally realized that not a man of his would make it off the field of battle unless he called for retreat. As the Barbarians run from the battle, Bruenor is struck from behind with a wooden pole atop his head. He turns to see the culprit is a young boy, the standard-bearer of Heafstagg. <b><i>\"Fool boy,\"</i></b> he yells at the child, <b><i>\"ain't ye never been told not to hit a dwarf in the head?\"</i></b> He knocks the child unconscious with the back of his axe blade. Nearby, Drizzt meets with Heafstagg as he is running for his life. They engage in battle, and Drizzt is able to get a blade into the Barbarians shoulder, but is himself slowed by his earlier wound. Heafstagg backhands the drow, knocking him away. Heafstagg bears down on the dark elf, and the two of them trade blow after blow, until they both pass out from the blood loss. Heafstagg is carried away by his men while Drizzt is left for dead on the battlefield. Kemp, the councilor for Targos (whom Regis had bewitched with his ruby), and his men find Drizzt unconscious, and literally kick him while he's down. When about to strike a blow to kill Drizzt, Kemp is interrupted by by Agorwal, councilor from the rival town of Termaline. <b><i>\"Were it not for the dark elf, Termaline would be in flames,\"</i></b> Agorwal exclaims. <b><i>\"Drizzt is under my protection now! And never again shall I, or my fellow men of Termaline, prejudge him by the color of his skin and the reputation of his kin!\"</i></b> Kemp calls Agorwal a fool as the men of Termaline carry Drizzt from the field of battle. Across the battlefield, two men find the young boy who hit Bruenor on the head. Bruenor has his life spared, and asks his name. The boy replies, <b><i>\"Wulfgar,</i></b> and Bruenor informs him that he is now to be Bruenor's servant for the next five years.<p>Four and a half years later, Wulfgar, a boy no longer, having grown into a strapping young man, entering his fifth and final Spring in Bruenor's service. While he had been angry and bitter in his initial days, he eventually came to respect and love the surly dwarf like a father, and worked hard every day to please the old codger. Wulfgar had been given more freedom over the months and years, and had been taught smithcraft by the dwarven clan chief, becoming quite skilled at forging blades. In time, he came to see that he owed the dwarf a great debt for saving his life and making him a better man.</p> Bruenor then embarks on a quest to create his greatest work. Bruenor's father had told him, <b><i>\"If yer talent for the craft is keen, and ye're lucky enough to live long and feel the strength of the earth, ye'll find a special day. A special blessin'. For once, and only once, the very best of our smiths may craft a weapon of their choosing that outdoes any work they'd ever done. A weapon of legend.\"</i></b> Today was Bruenor's day. Aegis-Fang was given shape. Aegis-Fang, a weapon of legend, of power, one that would \"change the course of history, and reshape all of Icewind Dale.\" During the long night of it's forging, Drizzt kept watch over the dwarf, never telling him he witnessed the birth of Bruenor's <i>magnum opus</i>.<p>Later, Bruenor finally presents Wulfgar with two magnificent gifts, his freedom, and Aegis-Fang. From the moment Wulfgar hefted the hammer, it had been made for him, or better yet, he had been born of it by the gods. The only condition placed upon the gift, a vow which Wulfgar easily spoke, was that the great weapon never be raised against the people of Ten Towns. The next day, Bruenor introduces Wulfgar to his new instructor, the dark elf Drizzt Do'urden. The same prejudices Wulfgar held toward women were quickly exposed in the beginnings of his relationship with the drow.</p><p>Wulfgar quickly swallowed his pride and learned all he could from this adept drow warrior. He came to appreciate this quiet elf's sense of honor and dignity. By the end of the second week, the barbarian was in complete control of his great hammer, and could successfully block most of the elf's scimitar thrusts. He came to recognize not only his weak and open areas, but learned how to counter-strike after a successful parry. Soon, Drizzt was confident the man could fell a giant in a single blow, if only he could learn patience.</p><p>Later that night, as Drizzt and Wulfgar are running around the perimeter of the Dale, the big man questioned the dark elf's very presence in the cold north. Why was a creature of such skill and impeccible morality in such a place? And above all, why did he leave his people? Drizzt responds, <b><i>\"They kill without mercy. They kill without passion. Lolth, the demon goddess they serve, feeds on treachery and violence--leaving no room for anything else. That's why I'm here.\"</i></b> When Wulfgar counters that he'll never see his people or his family again, Drizzt says that he has his own respect, and that is enough, leading Wulfgar to whisper to himself, <b><i>\"Perhaps we are not so different.\"</i></b></p><p>Drizzt halts their patrol when he smells the scent of fresh blood nearby. They run to see the bodies of the dwarves, Bundo and Dourgas, stuffed in the tree. Drizzt easily sees the giant footprints in the dirt, and deduces they are part of a much larger force. He send Wulfgar back to warn Bruenor and the others, promising, <b><i>\"I won't start the fun without you.'</i></b> Wulfgar ran all through the night, pushing himself to his peak to warn Bruenor to rouse the clan. Then, he turned back around without resting and ran back north to where he left Drizzt, eager to finally put Aegis-Fang to good use.</p> Bruenor and his dwarves, meanwhile, are slowly but steadily marching, following the directions provided by Wulfgar. An advance scout reports sighting a large group of giants and ogres ahead, but Bruenor realizes they are not yet near the place Wulfgar indicated the giant's camp lay. Bruenor and his men set a trap for the advancing reinforcements and laid in wait, slaughtering nearly all the ogres and many of the giants with their arrows. The dwarves descended upon the dazed and panicked giants, killing them swifly and not allowing a single foe to escape. The battle, in the place known as Daledrop, was over in three minutes.<p>Bruenor, having kept one of the ogres from the battle of Daledrop alive, gets Regis to use his Ruby Pendant on the creature. They learn that all of the orc, goblin, ogre, giant and barbarian tribes have united under the banner of Adar Kessell, and they plan to shortly attack Ten Towns. Wulfgar is enraged, believing his people would never band with such creatures, but he and the others know the power of Regis' jewel, it cannot be lied to. Regis goes to Bryn Shander to warn the council, a task which takes several days since the leaders are all loath to leave their own cities again.</p><p>Spokesman Kemp, as usual, mistrusts the word of the dwarves, especially since they ally themselves with Drizzt. Even more, he feels them stupid for relying on the word of an ogre, eventually accusing Agorwal of concocting the plan so that he could draw the citizens of Targos away from their fishing so that Termaline's fishers could freely fish alone. Cassius calls on Regis to \"persuade\" Kemp, to which the Termaline spokesman balks, stating that Regis has some sort of magic about him which allows him to sway those to whom he speaks. At this, the unswayed members of the council grow suspicious of Regis, causing Bruenor to storm out of the council chambers, leaving the human settlements to fend for themselves.</p><p>From there Bruenor locks himself and his clan in thier hole to wait out the coming war. Realizing it was not the right decision he and his clans dig back out to help fight the golinoid army. Thier arrival proved cruical in turning back the army.</p><p>Once the new treatys were signed Bruenor set out with Drizzt, Wulfgar, and Regis to find his long lost home Mithral Hall. In this journey they traveled from Icewind Dale, to Luskan, to Silverymoon, to Heralds Holdfast before they found Mithral Hall.</p><p>Inside the hall was a great evil. The same evil that chased his clan out so long ago the shadow dragon Shimmergloom. There Bruenor battled the wyrm where he and the dragon dissapeared down the gorge.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In the Easter Uprising of 1916, young Irishmen fought and died for the freedom of the Irish Republic. They were outnumbered, outgunned and, some believe, sacrificed as a symbol of  Irish courage and British oppression. In the end, the uprising failed.</p> <p>Billy Cassidy thought he was fighting for his people's freedom, but soon discovered that he and his fellow soldiers were being set to slaughter. So he grabbed his younger brother Proinsias and blasted their way out of Dublin, before escaping by swimming up the Liffey (but not before kneeing a certain famed Irish soldier in the privates)</p> <p>On the way, Billy discussed what they had done with his brother, and revealed a family secret - that their mother was a Protestant. Prionsias was shocked by this, yet was eased when Billy told them their differing religious beliefs were unimportant considering they loved each other.  They looked forward to going home and living long lives in peace.</p> <p>On their way home though, while stopped for a rest,  Proinsias was attacked by a grotesque bog-hag who started gnawing at his neck. Billy blew half the things head off with his revolvers, and searched for hours for his brother. Disheartened, he headed for home.  As far as he knew, his brother was dead. He was wrong. As it turned out,  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10527\" href=\"/cassidy/4005-10527/\">Cassidy</a> the younger lived far longer than his brother ever would have....</p>",

His sector was invaded by Doctor Ub'x and his Crabster Army. Doctor Ub'x succeeded in killing off the Green Lantern of H'Iven, <a href=\"/brr/4005-50955/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50955\">B'rr</a>. When Ch'p's predecessor was murdered, he had not yet chosen someone to receive his ring and take his place, so the Guardians were left without a Green Lantern for Sector 1014. As the leader of H'Iven's rebellion against Doctor Ub'x, Ch'p had been sentenced to death. While awaiting his sentence, one of the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\">Guardians of the Universe</a> themselves visited him in his prison cell and asked him to join the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps</a>. Mostly operating on H'Iven at first, Ch'p struggled with his identity the same way the Green Lanterns of Earth had. Ch'p had to hide who he was from his girlfriend, M'nn'e, but she soon found out his identity as a Lantern when he was forced to rescue her from Ub'x.</p><h2>Service in the Corps</h2><p>During Ch'p's career as a Lantern, he had frequent battles with Doctor Ub'x and had to repeatedly defeat him in order to protect H'Iven. Ub'x had even managed to take Ch'p's ring away at one point, but Ch'p left the ring with a command to imprison Ub'x and turned the situation to his advantage. Aside from protecting his own sector, Ch'p frequently aided the Corps in major battles where as much firepower as possible was needed. He participated in the attack on <a href=\"/qward/4020-41619/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41619\">Qward</a> to destroy the <a href=\"/anti-green-lantern-corps/4060-53829/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-53829\">Anti-Green Lantern Corps</a> as well as the battle against <a href=\"/maaldor/4005-50604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50604\">Maaldor</a> which resulted in the death of Green Lantern <a href=\"/arkkis-chummuck/4005-50557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50557\">Arkkis Chummuck</a>. During his time with the Corps, Ch'p befriended many of his fellow Lanterns including <a href=\"/arisia/4005-2046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2046\">Arisia</a> and <a href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\">John Stewart</a>. Most notable, however, was his friendship with veteran Lantern <a href=\"/salaak/4005-11304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11304\">Salaak</a>, who received aid from the Hl'ven native when Salaak's true personality was buried beneath that of the fictitious Pol Manning.</p><p>During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Ch'p fought alongside his fellow lanterns with loyalty and bravery. However, when the crisis was over and the multiverse was no more, Ch'p found it difficult to adjust. When he found out that M'nn'e had married his best friend in the current timeline, Ch'p found that there was nothing left for him on H'Iven and relocated to Earth.</p><h2>Death</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62697/1266286-chp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1266286\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.007556675063\" data-width=\"397\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 397px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62697/1266286-chp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1266286\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62697/1266286-chp.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62697/1266286-chp.jpg 397w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" data-width=\"397\"></a></figure><p>Towards the end of his life, Ch’p became very depressed and tried to kill himself, however, his old friend Lantern Salaak showed up in time to stop him and convince him that he needed to live and continue to carry out his responsibility to the Corps and to the universe. Ch’p then spent some time in hibernation. When he awoke from hibernation he was stationed on the Mosaic World which had been located on <a href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\">Oa</a>. It was there that he was killed when a yellow truck hit him.</p><h3>Blackest Night</h3><p>The corpse of Ch'p rested in the crypt of the Green Lantern Corps' honored dead on Oa, until that crypt was breached by a swarm of black power rings. Ch'p, like many other deceased Green Lanterns, was reanimated as a <a href=\"/black-lantern-corps/4060-50743/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50743\">Black Lantern</a>. He, along with the others, attacked the still-living Green Lanterns on and around Oa. Due to the destruction of the <a href=\"/black-lantern-power-battery/4055-55899/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55899\">Black Lantern Central Power Battery</a>, Ch'p is assumed to be dead once more...</p><h2><b>Powers and Abilities</b></h2><p><b>Ch’p is a bearer of the Green Lantern Ring and one of the most powerful of the Corps. The abilities the ring grants him are:</b></p><ul><li><b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> Every ring has a connection to the Main Battery on Oa, which taps into an artificial intelligence. It acts as an \"on-board computer,\" telling the wearer what they need to know. It can either respond out loud, or silently directly to the wearer's mind. The AI contains a large database of information that may be crucial to a Lantern's success. The ring also translates nearly every language to and from the wearer (though they have difficulty translating profanity), which is why the Corps can communicate with each other. When the bearer of a Green Lantern ring dies, the ring will seek out a suitable replacement for their sector. The AI can be used to play a holographic playback sequence complete with colors across the spectrum based on information in memory banks. The ring can dictate when to pause or stop the playback should an interruption arise where the Lanterns undivided attention is needed. The AI can also alert the wielder of incoming threats or of attempts to manipulate the wielders construct by an outside party.</li><li><b>Communicator:</b> The ring can act as a personal communicator between Green Lanterns. They have also been seen connected to telephones.</li><li><b>Costumes:</b> The wearer of the ring may create any costume they choose, based on their personal preferences, whenever they choose. The ring projects the costume over any clothes already worn at the time. The only rules that the Guardians of the Universe implement on the creation of a individual costumed is that the ring bearer display the insignia of the Green Lantern Corps.</li><li><b>Energy Projection:</b> The rings can also project beams, form protective bubbles and force fields, and fire destructive blasts. Sometimes, depending on the wearer, the beams and blasts make sounds. <a href=\"/kilowog/4005-6952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6952\">Kilowog</a>'s ring is one such example of blasts making sounds.</li><li><b>Energy Constructs:</b> The rings can construct anything the wearer can imagine from hard-light energy, as long as they are willing to make it. The more determined the wearer is, the more complex and intricate these things can be. The constructs can even be so complex as to form working machines, computers, and even people.</li><li><b>Flight:</b> The ring allows the wearer to fly in atmosphere or in space, and can achieve incredible speeds, moving from planet to planet in a matter of hours.</li><li><b>Invisibility:</b> The ring can make the wearer or anything else invisible.</li><li><b>Phasing:</b> The ring allows the user to go through walls. This ability however required great concentration on the bearer of the ring</li><li><b>Power Absorbing:</b> In the JLA's first fight with <a href=\"/amazo/4005-3737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3737\">Amazo</a>, it was GL who defeated him by drawing out all of Amazo's powers. In Green Lantern/ <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a>: Unholy Alliances, Kyle defeated Parallax with SS' power and <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> with Oa's energy by drawing out all that extra energy from them which made them unconscious. However he couldn't hold all that power nor could his Ring like Hal did with Amazo's powers, so that move isn't often used with so much power.</li><li><b>Recharging:</b> The rings need to be recharged by means of a <a href=\"/power-battery/4015-42357/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42357\">Power Battery</a>. Other large sources of power may be used to recharge a power ring, however effectiveness may vary. The internal power source of a <a href=\"/manhunter-android/4005-11316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11316\">Manhunter Android</a> is, in effect, the same as a power battery, and can be used to recharge a power ring. During the <a href=\"/jla-avengers/4050-10941/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-10941\">JLA / Avengers</a> crossover, a <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\">Cosmic Cube</a>was used to recharge a depleted ring, although this is not an ideal solution and is available if there are no other options.</li><li><b>Electro-magnetic scanning:</b> The ring can allow(through the use of x rays) the user to see through walls, without the people on the other side knowing. it can also scan along the Electromagnetic spectrum.</li><li><b>Wormhole/Warps:</b> The ring can open wormholes to cut down on distance.</li><li><b>Healing:</b> A wielder can command a ring to heal him/her/itself of any injures incurred. It can also heal others. This ability however cannot regenerate lost limbs.</li><li><b>Sub-routines:</b> The power rings have inner programmings or mechanisms which can executed without the users permission. One such sub-routine is the autoshield. This shield automatically protects a wielder from external harm and has been proven to be capable of protecting the wielder from planetary level attacks.</li></ul><h2><b>Retconned</b></h2><p><b>Radiation:</b> Besides light based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Green <a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite</a>, a form of radiation that is harmful to <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>. However, this ability is no longer valid and has been retconned.</p><p><b>Time travel:</b> The ring allows the wielder the ability to travel through time, though the process requires great willpower.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p><b>Mental Incapacitation</b>: The ring cannot be wielded correctly if the wearer is under the influence of drugs or if there is an involvement of neural interference.</p><p><b>Yellow Impurity</b>: In the beginning the Green Ring was vulnerable to the color yellow. It was unable to defend against attacks from wielders of the Sinestro Corps as well. This weakness however has now be changed and can be overcome by veterans who have the ability to overcome great fear. Hal Jordan was of the first of the Green Lanterns to show that this weakness could be overcome.</p><p><b>Recharge</b>: Previously had to be recharged every 24 hours or when it has been depleted of energy. This can be accomplished if the bearer of the ring recites an oath into his power lantern while holding the ring to it. However now, the power ring only needs to be recharged when it runs out of energy. Sinestro stated to Hal that it was possible for a Green Lantern to store his.her battery in a pocket Universe and take it with them wherever they went but so far Hal has not displayed the ability to do this.</p><p><b>Red Lantern Corps</b>: Bearers of the red ring have the ability to drain a Green Power Ring of its energy. The ring of a Blue Lantern however has the ability to charge a Green Lantern Ring or negate this negative effect. Blue Lanterns rings also have the ability to purge the negative effects that a Red Lanterns Ring can cause upon the wielder of a Green Lantern Ring.</p><p><b>(Previous Weaknesses)</b></p><p><b>Ability To Kill</b>: One of the main weaknesses of the Power Rings that greatly disturbed Sinestro was the fact that the bearers of the Green Lantern Ring were unable to kill. Recently however, this restriction on the rings has been lifted but murder is still against the law of the GL Corps<b>.</b> This restriction was lifted by the Guardians of the Universe during the War of the Green Lanterns.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Before he came to America, MacCann was a soldier in the British Army against the Germans in 1917.  He was stationed in Passchendaele, and saw his friends getting killed in the trenches, and decided that the military life was not for him.  So he deserted, and fled to New York City where he became a mainstay of the Irish expat society.</p><p>He befriended many of the new immigrants, including a young man named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10527\" href=\"/cassidy/4005-10527/\">Cassidy</a>, who easily beat him at arm wrestling.  MacCann introduced Cassidy to his fellow countrymen, and they made their home at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41402\" href=\"/mcsorleys-old-ale-house/4020-41402/\">McSorley's Old Ale House</a>.  There MacCann held court with his countrymen in their new home.</p><p>Interestingly enough, MacCann knew that Cassidy was a vampire before Cassidy did.  Being relatively unread and uneducated, and without the dearth of vampire fiction that we have today, Cassidy had never considered exactly what that old swamp-hag's bite had done to him.</p><p>But MacCann had read Dracula, and knew exactly what had happened to him.  He lent the book to Cassidy, which explained a great deal.</p><p>Eventually Cassidy left McSorley's, MacCann and his friends, afraid of having to watch them grow old and die.  But they met again in 1975, just by chance.  MacCann was older and walked with a cane, and Cassidy was unchanged, but they spent hours catching up.  Before they parted for the last time, MacCann urged Cassidy to \"Make the most of it.\"  They never met again.</p>",

He became involved in crime-fighting when his daughter was kidnapped. Spending nine years in the hunt, he uncovers that the criminal Jack Carver had orchestrated the kidnapping. Using his acting abilities and facility for disguise, he dresses as an elderly woman, Madame Fatal, to infiltrate Carver's gang. Carver died, but not before revealing that Madame Fatal's daughter lived on. </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Madame Fatal was created by <a href=\"/art-pinajian/4040-41375/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41375\">Art Pinajian</a>. He first appears in <em><a href=\"/crack-comics/4050-18074/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18074\">Crack Comics</a></em> #1.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Madame Fatal </h3><p>Retiring from the theatre to pursue crime-fighting full-time, Stanton maintains the identity of Madame Fatal to aid him in his pursuit of justice. He also continues to pursue the investigation into his missing daughter, whom Carver had handed off to other villains sometime before his death. During this time he faced supervillains such as The Jester and Doctor Prowl. </p><h3>The Shade</h3><p>Madame Fatal is hired by the <a href=\"/shade/4005-9362/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9362\">Shade</a> to protect <a href=\"/darnell-caldecott/4005-81901/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81901\">Darnell Caldecott</a>, the wealthy industrialist. Going by the name Miss Sharp, he pretends to be a personal assistant and secretary for Caldecott. When Caldecott is captured by <a href=\"/nazis/4060-49867/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49867\">Nazis</a> and nearly killed, Madame Fatal springs into action, aiding in the rescue of Caldecott and revealing his true identity at the same time. At the conclusion of the fighting, Shade provides the location of Madame Fatal's daughter, which he had obtained in exchange for Darnell's protection. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Madame Fatal has no known superhuman abilities. However, he is at peak physical condition and is both agile and athletic. He carries a cane which doubles as a quarterstaff weapon. He is very intelligent, and has a strong intuition which aids him in investigating crimes. He is skilled at acting and the convincing use of disguise.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Originally surname Etchinson, Arnolds uncle who was a politician disowned him and his father after realizing his own brother was a thief and a murderer and had his surname forcibly changed to Etkar to avoid any public association with him. As it turned out Arnold would prove to be just as bad as his father if not worse as he was committed to an asylum after butchering nineteen people. Years later Arnold managed to escape from Arkham with help from a unknown source, he focused his attention on his brothers son (Henry Etchinson) who was also an up and coming politician running for mayor. He turned up when Henry was at an election rally and killed Henry's wife in cold blood with a gun, shooting everyone else in the frenzy and attempting to kill Henry before he was distracted by <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/vicki-vale/4005-8264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8264\">Vicky Vale</a> taking his picture, allowing Henry to escape. He chases after the reporter and would have killed her had Batman not shown up, never the less he managed to avoid capture. Using thorough detective work Batman was able to deduce Abbatoir's link to the Etchinson family and where he could find the villain. He managed to track Abattoir to his family's cemetery and after a brief confrontation Etkar was eventually captured. It turned out that it was Henry Etchinson himself who had arranged for the lunatics escape because he wanted Abbatoir to come after him during the rally in the hope that it would gain him publicity for the election, if he survived the killers rampage. It was also revealed that Henry's wife was filling for divorce and that he wanted Abattoir to kill his wife to avoid any bad press the divorce would bring. As a result Henry Etchinson was sent to prison and Abbatior committed to <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham Asylum</a>.</p><p>When <a href=\"/bane/6129/\" data-ref-id=\"6129\">Bane</a> sets all the inmates free from the asylum, Abattoir flees and goes on to kill several more family members shooting then skinning them, Abattoir then tracks down his cousins son (Graham) who was orphaned as a result of his fathers incarceration and currently works at <a href=\"/leslie-thompkins/4005-3740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3740\">Doctor Thompkins</a> Orphanage. While Graham is preparing to take a group of orphans on a camping trip Abbatoir manages to commandeer their bus after posing as the driver (who he had killed earlier). Whilst driving them away far enough for anyone to find them Abbatoir revealed himself to Graham brandishing a gun and prepares to kill his cousin as well as the 12 orphans whose \"Souls\" he would \"consume\". However <a href=\"/batman/1699/\" data-ref-id=\"1699\">Batman</a>'s replacement, <a href=\"/azrael/12834/\" data-ref-id=\"12834\">Azrael</a>, catches up with Abattoir and the two battle on the roof of the bus. Unfortunately as it was snowing the bus lost control and nearly crashed off the edge of a cliff, while Azrael got the better of Abbatior in battle Abbatoir fell off the roof and managed to escape after the snow gave him a soft landing sliding off the cliff. With the bus dangling off the edge Azrael was left with the dilemma to pursue Abbatoir or save Graham Etchinson and the childeren. Ultimately Azrael chose to save the children and managed to pull the bus back up to safety with a combination of his grapple tied between the bus and a tree and his strength, by which time Abbatoir had managed to escape on board a oncoming train.</p><p>Abbatoir later came after his nephew again and managed to kidnap him after being aided by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/clayface-payne/4005-23494/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23494\">Preston Payne</a> (due to Abbatoir holding Paynes son hostage as leverage). Etkar then strapped his nephew in a torture device before having to escape from Azrael again who chased him into a refinery. Inside the refinery, Abattoir is nearly knocked into a vat of molten metal, but hangs on to a plank. Azrael does not save Etchinson, but allows him to fall to his death. Unknown to Azrael, Abattoir had kidnapped Graham Etchinson, and was keeping him in a hidden torture chamber. By allowing Abattoir to die, Azrael had condemned the innocent man to death.</p><h3>Bough Breaks</h3><p><strong>For more information see: <a href=\"/batman-annual-22-bough-breaks/4000-82307/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-82307\">Batman Annual #22 - Bough Breaks</a></strong></p><p>Abattoir eventually returned as a ghost in an attempt finish his mission of killing relatives. He was trying to scare his last blood relative, a cousin, into a miscarriage. Batman, now back to full health and in his rightful role, confronts the ghost. Abattoir attempts to torment Batman, using Azrael's armor, but Batman proves to be unaffected. Batman eventually tricks Abattoir into abandoning the armor and his mission.</p><h2>Blackest Night</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1013443\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16529/1013443-abattoir2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1548821548822\" data-width=\"297\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 297px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16529/1013443-abattoir2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1013443\"><img alt=\"Black Lantern Arnold\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16529/1013443-abattoir2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16529/1013443-abattoir2.jpg 297w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px\" data-width=\"297\"></a><figcaption>Black Lantern Arnold</figcaption></figure><p><strong>For more information see: <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/blackest-night/4045-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\">Blackest Night</a></strong></p><p>While Arnold's body is being transported from Gotham to Washington D.C. to be housed in the Justice League's fortified crypt, a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/black-lantern-corps/4060-50743/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50743\">Black Lantern Corps</a> Ring, finds him and brings him back to life as a Black Lantern.

The kidnapper has been abducting members of Gotham's elite as well as those who are well educated. Dr. Adrian Kohut, a psychiatrist at Arkham who was treating Harvey Dent with his multiple personality disorder, is the latest victim of this elusive kidnapper. Batman observes Kohut's office while Gordon checks for any patients that might have a grudge against the doctor. Batman finds a fiber that matches a special napkin used at restaurant called Chez Nous. The restaurant was closed for renovation but Batman knew immediately that he was in the right place because he found the clothes of all the other victims hanging in the coat check room. It made sense now to Batman why so many victims had disappeared and no ransoms were made... the kidnapper was devouring his victims.</p><p>Batman continues to investigate until he smells something delicious. He then notices a covered dish on a nearby table. Batman lifts the lid and is shocked by the mere sight of it. The kidnapper has taken someone's brain and sauteed it with a poached duck egg. Batman feels he is too late to save Kohut until he hears a noise coming from the kitchen. Batman races toward the kitchen and finds the decapitated head of Ben Cormicle, the head chef at Chez Nous. Batman continued to search the kitchen and finds Adrian Kohut hanging in the freezer with a meat hook protruding from his right shoulder. Batman calls in Gordon to investigate the crime scene while he acts on a new lead. Before Kohut went into a catatonic state, he told Batman that the kidnapper was after another potential victim. Gordon calls in Wallace \"Wally\" Camp, one of the precinct's csi's, to investigate the crime scene.</p><p>Batman makes his way to Prospect Park where the Wayne Foundation has renovated old brownstone buildings into livable homes. Dr. Bako Su, is a psychology professor at Gotham University and he becomes the kidnapper's alternative victim since he was unable to consume Dr. Kohut. Dr. Su tries to reach out to the kidnapper but the cannibal slaps Su because there are too many people talking. Dr. Su suspects that the kidnapper suffers from a multiple personality disorder but he is unable to get in contact with anyone since all personalities are fighting for control of the kidnapper's body. Batman arrives just in time to combat the cannibal but kidnapper feels so rushed by the Batman's interference that he takes his frustration out on Su. With the flick of his wrist, the kidnapper grabs a butcher's knife and slits Dr. Su's throat. Batman tries to keep Dr. Su from bleeding out but fails to save him.</p><p>Batman returns to the Batcave and suspects that the killer practices Maori which is a social cannibalistic ritual among tribal warriors who celebrate their victory over their enemies. The killer put a tribal tattoo on his face in order to conceal his identity but Batman figures its a way to deal with the guilt and shame of his actions. However, the one thing that troubles Batman is the Maori connection with this new Abattoir because the killer possesses gymnastic and surgical precision skills. Batman goes back to the beginning of these Abattoir slayings and recalls two particular victims. One victim was Eddie Campbell, a parkour master and stuntsman. The other victim is Dr. Antonio Bayless, the former head of surgery at Gotham Hospital. Batman doubts it but its possible that the Abattoir is killing particular people in order to possess their skills and knowledge. Ultimately, this new Abattoir is troubled by multiple personalities and he knows it which is uncommon for those who suffer from this disorder.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gordon investigates another murder in Crime Alley. The Abattoir killed a transvestite named Anthony Della Russo. Gordon asks Bullock where Wally Camp is but Bullock reports that Officer Murphy and Camp have been having problems with their relationship. Gordon then gets a call from Det. Montoya that a group of officers have found Camp's mutilated body in the precinct's parking garage and her gun is missing.</p><p>Later that same day, Bruce heads to Orange Interior, a high end home catering boutique because he must see his decorator about a Paul McCobb desk. Bruce arrives at the Orange and is greeted by the store clerk. Bruce recognizes the clerk as Jersey Pallet, the sole survivor of a plane crash in the Cascade Mountains that occurred a couple of years back. It was said that Pallet was trapped in the snowy mountains for six weeks until he managed to fix the plane and fly back to civilization.</p><p>Bruce looks around the store and finds a pair of Charles Hollis Jones occasional chairs in Lucite from the 1970's. Pallet informs Bruce that the chairs are going for 4800 dollars which was 200 dollars less than the Brioni suit that Bruce was wearing. Bruce was impressed by Pallet's knowledge on vintage luxury items. Bruce also saw Pallet staring at his Patek watch but Bruce's attention was immediately taken away by something else nearby. Bruce noticed an assortment of Herend glass figurines on a table then he recalls one of Abattoir's victims. The victim's name was Becca Proust and according to the police file, there were a few figurines that were missing from Proust's glass menagerie.</p><p>Bruce starts a conversation with Pallet by saying how strange it is for a modern mid century boutique to carry Herend figurines. Pallet doesn't respond because he suspects Bruce may be putting things together about his secret identity. Bruce then questions Pallet on how he managed to survive in the mountains for six weeks. Bruce says that one investigative reporter hinted at the possibility that there were other survivors besides Pallet. Pallet exclaims that the reporter was simply making wild accusations about him becoming a cannibal in order to survive the harsh wilderness in the mountains. Bruce brushes off Pallet's anger by agreeing with him that reporters are infamous for stirring up rumors in order to gain sweeps.</p><p>Bruce tries to change conversation but stays on the topic of food. He asks Pallet if he ever tried offal or Rocky Mountain oysters. Pallet says he hasn't tried either one. Bruce then turns his attention to the McCobb desk and asks Pallet a hypothetical question \"If someone were a cannibal, I wonder what they would say on how human flesh tastes?\" It was at that moment that Pallet grabs Camp's gun from the back of his pants and pistol whips Bruce across the back of his head. Bruce falls to the floor unconscious. Pallet informs Bruce how we will enjoy consuming the essence of a billionaire and answers Bruce's question by saying \"Human flesh tastes like chicken.\"</p><p>Bruce wakes up in dank basement because he smells a delicious aroma. Pallet was performing mirepoix, a traditional consumption of aromatics. Pallet was mincing carrots, onions and celery to be sauteed as a precursor to his haute cuisine. Bruce tries to deter Pallet's attention by saying he should do a juice cleanse before the vegetables are cooked. Pallet ignores Wayne's chattering by walking towards him then proceeds by brushing his butcher's knife across Bruce's left leg.</p><p>Pallet moves his diamond-fiber line blade closer to Bruce's genitals and explains that he suffers from a rare form of anthropophage. Bruce knows what the term means but he pretends to be stupid by asking Pallet what exactly is anthropophage. Bruce's question angers Pallet who says anthropophage is the clinical term for cannibalism. Bruce makes a joke by asking Pallet if he must eat Bruce's entire body or just a few pieces because he wouldn't mind losing a few pounds. Bruce's joke aggravates Pallet to the point where he gets up close and personal. Bruce headbutts Pallet and sends him tumbling across the room. The blade falls behind Bruce's back and Bruce uses the blade to cut his restraints.</p><p>Pallet gets to his feet and pulls out another blade. He charges after Bruce but Bruce disarms Pallet by fracturing the distal radius in Pallet's wrist. Pallet milks his fractured wrist and his state of mind changes as Bruce approaches him. Pallet's voice suddenly becomes higher and octave as if Pallet were actually a woman. Pallet exclaims to Bruce that he is actually Wallace Camp, Gordon's CSI examiner. Bruce becomes stricken with a moment of grief because he knew Det. Camp and now Camp's essence has become a part of Pallet's twisted subconscious.</p><p>Bruce gives in by trying to comfort Pallet not realizing that it was a sympathy act of Pallet's in order to drop Bruce's guard. Pallet grabs Bruce and throws him across the basement. Pallet makes another attempt to subdue Bruce. Fortunately, Pallet's blade was near Bruce. Bruce decided to take a desperate measure to put an end to Pallet's rampage. Bruce uses his training and understanding of the human body by inflicting cuts throughout Pallet's body. Each time Bruce dodged one of Pallet's blows, he made a quick incision on Pallet's body. Pallet began to slow down as his body was losing blood. Bruce's technique was effective and non lethal just as long Pallet gets medical attention afterwards.</p><p>Bruce makes a call to Gordon's precinct and Gordon's team head to Pallet's location. The medical team manage to cauterize Pallet's wounds and give him a blood transfusion. Batman arrives on the scene and tells Gordon that the house belonged to Chris Phelps, the pilot of the plane that Pallet was in when it crashed. Pallet is taken away to Arkham in a catatonic state and is immediately put on a plant based diet.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Hand to Hand Combat</h3><p>Abbatoir is able to hold his own against Azrael and Batman due to his bloodthirsty nature</p><p>Endurance-Able to withstand large amounts of punishment from oppenents for a limited time.</p><h3>Physical Peak</h3><p>Outstanding physical condition for a man in his 40's.</p><h3>Strength</h3><p>Frenzied and powerfull probably down to the adreneline rush Etkar recieved after killing his victims</p><p><strong><u>PERSONALITY AND BELIEFS</u></strong></p><p>Perhaps one of the most disturbing aspects of Etkar was his lack of appathy, while his primary victims were his family members Etkar had no qualms with killing civilians as well , as a matter of fact he seemed to equally relish in slaughtering them just as much as his family. He would often get a kick out of torturing his victims first or the very least terrifying them, such an example was his treament of his nephew Graham Etchinson whom Abbatoir strapped to a Bed of Spikes with weights dropping vertically above grahams chest. ( The mechanism was designed to drop one weight every hour resulting in a slow and painfull death for his nephew.)</p><p>Etkar strongly believed in the supernatural, in paticular the possesion of the human soul. He believed by killing a human he would posses their soul and gain their strength making him more powerful. Oddly enough Abattoir actually aquired these abilities twice after his death . The first as a reanimated Ghost trying to consome his last living cousins unborn childs soul, The second during the Blackest Night storyline when his corpse was reanimated as a Black Lantern</p>",

He regularly indulged in blood drinking, and allowed others to drink his blood.  He put himself in danger for the group, getting his hand shot off by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10525\" href=\"/tulip/4005-10525/\">Tulip</a> and going one-on-one with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10527\" href=\"/cassidy/4005-10527/\">Cassidy</a> in an attempt to get the vampire to change him.

His good looks and ability to take just about anyone in a fight made him popular, but his impulsiveness and inability to learn from his mistakes made him dangerous.</p><p>When Eccarius introduced the group to another real vampire, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10527\" href=\"/cassidy/4005-10527/\">Cassidy</a>, Mako challenged the newcomer to a fight.  Cassidy knocked Mako clear across the room and broke his jaw.  The point was proven, but Mako nursed a hatred for Cassidy ever after, especially when Cassidy killed Eccarius, nearly destroying the purpose of the group Mako loved.</p><p>A few years later, Mako got his chance at revenge.  Cassidy had returned, and Les Enfents were prepared to do whatever was necessary to force him to turn them into vampires.  They caught him in a ceremony, where Cassidy's friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\">Jesse Custer</a> was undergoing a complex voodoo ritual involving a giant serpent and memory regression.  Les Enfents took that opportunity to attack, and Cassidy's head was cut off.  Mako took great pleasure in kicking the head about the cemetary, but was wounded in the subsequent firefight.</p><p>In the end, Mako was eaten by the giant snake, to the surprise of all involved.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Bill Hicks was a comedian whose greatest talent was making people angry. He routinely blasted modern culture, tearing at the lies, hypocrisies and illusions of modern America.</p><p>Near the end of his career, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Despite this, he continued to tour and continued to do his acerbic brand of comedy. At one of these performances in Texas, a young preacher named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\" slug=\"jesse-custer\">Jesse Custer</a> came into the club. Custer was just looking for alcohol to drown the self-loathing he felt for having given in to the machinations of his grandmother. He watched Hicks' show and was inspired to tell the truth as he saw it as well.</p><p>When he returned to his town of Annville, Custer took Hicks' message of truth at any cost to heart, and nearly got beaten up for it.</p><p>Bill Hicks is also mentioned in the <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40644\" href=\"/garth-ennis/4040-40644/\" slug=\"garth-ennis\">Garth Ennis</a> graphic novel, <a data-ref-id=\"4050-18123\" href=\"/chronicles-of-wormwood/4050-18123/\" slug=\"chronicles-of-wormwood\">Chronicles of Wormwood</a>.

    "description": "<p>Gene Sergeant's past is shrouded in mystery.  Who he is, where he came from and how he made himself into who he is today is unknown.  What is known about him is that he has a shrewd business mind and an almost pathological disregard for ethics that have made him fabulously wealthy.</p><p>He discovered a young man nicknamed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10531\" href=\"/arseface/4005-10531/\">Arseface</a> singing with an improv band in New Orleans.  The boy's style was obviously rough, and his chances at achieving success by himself were marginal.  His lyrics were incomprehensible and his appearance was unsettling, to say the least.  But Sergeant was a keen observer of the times, and knew that, in the era of grunge and garage rock, a young man like Arseface could conquer the nation.</p><p>Sergeant signed the boy to his record label, Georgia Records, and then promoted him to international superstardom.</p><p>Unfortunately, Arseface's popularity was pretty much based on novelty, and if Sergeant wanted to keep his cash cow in the limelight, he would have to take drastic measures.  He assured Arseface that he would take charge of everything, and then proceeded to make the boy one of the most reviled figures in popular entertainment.</p><p>In responding to lawsuits against Arseface by parents whose sons had died trying to emulate their idol's shotgunned appearance, Sergeant insulted the victims and belittled their losses. In doing so, he assured everyone that he was simply passing along Arseface's heartfelt opinions on the matter.</p><p>Between this treatment, and encouraging the Pope to \"Kiss Arseface's ass,\" Gene Sergeant not only made his client a media target, but also boosted the sales of his records more than their actual content would have done on their own.</p><p>When the multiple class-action lawsuits threatened to empty Arseface's coffers, and there were no more depths to which he could sink, Sergeant disappeared from the boy's life as suddenly as he had appeared, taking all of the money with him.  He left only a letter, gently informing his former client that he would soon be leaving the United States - perhaps to a \"discrete island nation\" - where he would continue to enjoy whatever revenues his record company would pull in.  He left Arseface to his own lamentable destiny.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Colonel Holden ran an Army base in the American Southwest, near Monument Valley in Arizona.  One day he received a visit from two civilians, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10528\" href=\"/starr/4005-10528/\">Starr</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10536\" href=\"/featherstone/4005-10536/\">Featherstone</a>, who claimed to represent a group called <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41404\" href=\"/the-grail/4060-41404/\">The Grail</a>, and that they were to take command of the base troops for a special exercise in the desert.  Holden was fully prepared to have the two arrested, but they produced an executive order, signed by the President, giving them authority over Holden and his men.</p><p>Order or no order, Holden didn't trust these two, and was fully prepared to take action against them if any of his men were harmed.</p><p>Holden's troops were to work with troops from The Grail in a massive co-operative exercise that appeared to be targeted at, strangely enough, a single man.  The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10522\" href=\"/saint-of-killers/4005-10522/\">Saint Of Killers</a>.  To Holden's experienced mind, it all sounded suspiciously like, in his words, \"Bullshit.\"  It wasn't until the Saint actually appeared and began destroying tanks and bringing down helicopters with his revolvers that Holden saw the truth.</p><p>The truth was not only that his men were dying unnecessarily against a supernatural menace, but that his men had been casually thrown away by Starr.  The army had just been used to give Starr and his Grail troops time to get <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\">Jesse Custer</a>, a man for whom Starr had an unending personal hatred.</p><p>When Holden realized this, he attempted to kill Starr, but was shot dead by Featherstone.  He did manage to shoot Starr in the leg, however, which later led to its amputation and subsequent eating.  He might have been pleased to know this.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Sheriff Bewley had the unenviable job of being the sheriff of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41403\" href=\"/salvation-texas/4020-41403/\">Salvation, Texas</a>, the kind of backwater town that just kind of slides off the map.  Hopelessness and poverty are rampant in the kind of town that, if you're not out by the time you're 25, you'll never get out.</p><p>It was the perfect place for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10545\" href=\"/odin-quincannon/4005-10545/\">Odin Quincannon</a>'s meat packing plant to set up shop.  It provided much-needed jobs and something of an economic boost.  With that, however, came lawlessness.  Quincannon's men would regularly come into town and harass the locals.  It was Bewley's job to make sure that they escaped any kind of police trouble and didn't take up the time of the judges that Quincannon had in his pocket.</p><p>So, with his deputy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23164\" href=\"/cindy-daggett/4005-23164/\">Cindy Daggett</a>, Bewley did as little work as possible in Salvation.  While he was comfortable with the money he got from Quincannon, he still knew he was being used and that he was betraying his badge.</p><p>When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10524\" href=\"/jesse-custer/4005-10524/\">Jesse Custer</a> came in to town and showed a knack for dealing with trouble, Bewley offered to deputize him.  Custer went one better and offered to take up the job as Sheriff.</p><p>Bewley knew a good chance when he saw one and gave the job to Custer.  He packed his things and left town, but Quincannon's reach was far and his forgiveness short.  Bewley was shot dead by a man in a police uniform some ways outside the Salvation town limits.</p>",

    "description": "<p>There is, unfortunately, a certain level of racism that pervades small towns in the Southern United States.  The town of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41403\" href=\"/salvation-texas/4020-41403/\">Salvation, Texas</a> is no exception.  It is predominantly white, with very few exceptions.  One of these was Hector, an immigrant from Mexico.  He tolerated the jokes and the ribbing, the backhanded insults from the townsfolk, because he knew that was the closest he would get to acceptance.  Plus, if he was pathetic enough, he might have a chance to sleep with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41388\" href=\"/cora/4005-41388/\">Cora</a>, a woman of very little discrimination when it came to her bed-partners.</p><p>Much later, after the terrible trouble with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10545\" href=\"/odin-quincannon/4005-10545/\">Odin Quincannon</a> in which Hector was shot, he got a job with the waste processing plant that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41397\" href=\"/conan-quincannon/4005-41397/\">Conan Quincannon</a>, the late meat-magnate's brother, opened in the town.  Quincannon soon discovered that Hector was one of the only people in the town with a serious education, and made him the foreman at the plant.  Soon Hector was the one making the jokes....</p>",
