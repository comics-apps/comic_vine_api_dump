She is named after the district of Thessaly in Greece. Her alias later on, Larissa, is the name of Thessaly's capital city. The region of Thessaly is also known as the land of witches.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Thessaly is a cold character. She is driven by self preservation and has no problem with killing. Thessaly isn't at all malicious harming only those who would attempt to harm her.</p><p>At some point in the past Thessaly was involved with <a href=\"/dream-of-the-endless-morpheus/4005-11171/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11171\">Dream</a> but it ended badly.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>A Game Of You</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132162/2700075-sandman__3__of_6____page_9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2700075\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.5441696113074\" data-width=\"283\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 283px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:254.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132162/2700075-sandman__3__of_6____page_9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2700075\"><img alt=\"Thessaly in A Game Of You\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132162/2700075-sandman__3__of_6____page_9.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132162/2700075-sandman__3__of_6____page_9.jpg 283w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132162/2700075-sandman__3__of_6____page_9.jpg 251w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px\" data-width=\"251\"></a><figcaption>Thessaly in A Game Of You</figcaption></figure><p>In the story <a href=\"/a-game-of-you/4045-40835/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40835\">A Game Of You</a> she ended up living in an apartment building with Barbie, Wanda, Foxglove, Hazel and a man named George. Thessaly kept to herself in the building until she was nearly killed by a creature called the Cuckoo who lived in Barbie's dreams, that was acting through George. Thessaly murdered George, then decapitated him, bit out his tongue and put nails through his eyes to keep them open and used her magic to make him talk. Thessaly found out the Cuckoo was behind the attack and along with Hazel and Foxglove using her magic she got the moon to allow her to journey into the Dreaming to kill the Cuckoo. Thessaly using the moon to transport herself to the Dreaming had dire consequences on the real world and caused a storm. Thessaly's apartment building was destroyed and Wanda another resident of the building was killed.</p><p>Thessaly meets the Cuckoo but it uses mind control on her rendering her defenseless. With Thessaly rendered inactive, the Cuckoo carries out her plan and destroys the dream land of her birth. With the dream land destroyed, Thessaly, Hazel, Foxglove and Barbie were trapped.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Originally stillborn due to <a href=\"/zoom/4005-41085/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41085\">Zoom</a> attacking her mother, <a href=\"/linda-park-west/4005-2394/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2394\">Linda Park-West</a>, <a href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\">Wally West</a> travelled back in time while fighting Zoom and pushed him into his own blast, causing what the doctors called \"Spontaneous pregnancy\" in the current timeline and reviving Iris and her brother <a href=\"/jai-west/4005-46070/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46070\">Jai</a>, being born happy and healthy. Iris is named after her great-Aunt, <a href=\"/iris-allen-west/4005-9977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9977\">Iris Allen West</a></p><p>Shortly after, during the <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a>, Wally West was sucked into the speed force while fighting <a href=\"/superman-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\">Superboy-Prime</a>. Returning home to say goodbye to Linda, she grabbed hold of him while holding Iris and Jai and all four Wests were sucked into the speed force. However, thanks to a key Linda was holding from the planet Savoth, the four of them actually ended up traveling to the planet Savoth, where the family was able to stay. The speed force had altered the children's genetic make-up though, and shortly after arriving on Savoth they began to age rapidly, eventually stabilizing when Iris was roughly 10 physically and Jai was 8 physically. The kids also developed powers, with Iris having the ability to vibrate her molecules through solid objects and Jai having the ability to accelerate the growth of his muscle tissue.</p><h3>Back to Earth</h3><p>During the events of the Lightning Saga, the Legion of Super-Heroes used their lightning rods to bring back the essence of Lightning Lad, however as a side effect of their actions, Wally, Linda, Iris and Jai were pulled back to Earth. Around this time, the kids developed powers, with Jai having the ability to accelerate the growth of his muscle tissue and Iris having the ability to vibrate her molecules through solid objects. She and Jai then started working with their dad to be super-heroes, and following a Ferry Rescue caught the attention of the media.</p><h3>Flash: Rebirth</h3><p>During the events of <a href=\"/the-flash-rebirth/4045-55893/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55893\">Flash: Rebirth</a>, Iris discovers that she and her brother are sharing their connection to the <a href=\"/speed-force/4015-42071/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42071\">speed force</a> which caused their abnormal abilities. She decides to end Jai's suffering by giving up her connection but inadvertently obtains the full connection to the speed force, regulating her powers. She then joins the rest of the Flash family in battle against <a href=\"/professor-zoom/4005-18340/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18340\">Professor Zoom</a> as the new Impulse, a mantle she takes on much to the surprise of her father and Bart.</p><h3>Road to Flashpoint</h3><p>Iris and the rest of the Flash Family are at a picnic, but Barry never shows up.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/112335/2103123-kid_flash_iris_west_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2103123\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/112335/2103123-kid_flash_iris_west_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2103123\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112335/2103123-kid_flash_iris_west_001.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/112335/2103123-kid_flash_iris_west_001.jpg 500w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112335/2103123-kid_flash_iris_west_001.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>In the alternate world of <a href=\"/kingdom-come/4045-41641/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41641\">Earth-22</a>, Iris West is the daughter of Wally West and <a href=\"/angela-margolin/4005-19088/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19088\">Angela Margolin</a>, rather than Linda Park. In this version, Iris has grown up to be the fourth Flash, although she is sometimes referred to as Kid Flash. Her older brother Barry is too lazy to take the mantle. In this world, Wally has all but ceased normal human activity, emanating from the Speed Force as a blurry Flash. Iris is quite bitter that she does not have a normal family life. She becomes a super heroine, part of a less than heroic new generation of superheroes.</p><p>During the events of <a href=\"/kingdom-come/4045-41641/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41641\">Kingdom Come</a>, she joins her fellow Titans children in <a href=\"/batmans-legion/4060-56491/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56491\">Batman</a>'s Silent Cavalry, a new form of the Outsiders. She assists Batman in stopping <a href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\">Lex Luthor</a>'s Human Defense Squad when they take on Luthor and his cronies. <a href=\"/billy-batson/4005-2350/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2350\">Captain Marvel</a> gets away, however, sparking a riot at the Superhuman gulag. In the ensuing chaos, Iris fights against the escaping convicts. When her father is wounded in the chaos of battle, she saves his life by depositing him inside of a protective bubble made by her friend <a href=\"/jade/4005-3406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3406\">Jade</a>. She presumably is able to survive due to her super speed.</p><p>Later, when a madman named Gog attempts alter the past, Rip Hunter recruits Iris, along with <a href=\"/damian-wayne/4005-42413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\">Ibn al Xu'ffasch</a>, <a href=\"/nightstar/4005-40842/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40842\">Nightstar</a> and <a href=\"/offspring/4005-43304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43304\">Offspring</a>. Ultimately, Hypertime is discovered, rendering this unnecessary.</p><p>Iris once again travels to the main universe when Donna Troy's existence is put in danger. This time, she travels with Nightstar, Donna's son <a href=\"/darkstar/4005-25279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25279\">Darkstar</a>, <a href=\"/lian-harper/4005-4698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4698\">the Red Hood</a> and Tula, the <a href=\"/aquagirl/4005-4686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4686\">Aquagirl</a> of her timeline.</p>",

Returning home to say goodbye to Linda, she grabbed hold of him while holding Iris and Jai and all four West's were sucked into the speed force. However, thanks to a key Linda was holding from the planet Savoth, the four of them actually ended up traveling to the planet Savoth, where the family was able to stay. The speed force had altered the children's genetic make-up though, and shortly after arriving on Savoth they began to age rapidly, eventually stabilizing when Jai was roughly 8 physically and Iris was 10 physically. The kids also developed powers, with Iris having the ability to vibrate her molecules through solid objects and Jai having the ability to accelerate the growth of his muscle tissue.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Jai West and his sister were created by Geoff Johns during his run on The Flash, specifically issue #225.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Back to Earth</h3><p>During the events of the Lightning Saga, the Legion of Super-Heroes used their lightning rods to bring back the essence of Lightning Lad, however as a side effect of their actions, Wally, Linda, Iris and Jai were pulled back to Earth. Around this time, the kids developed powers, with Jai having the ability to accelerate the growth of his muscle tissue and Iris having the ability</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49538/1034836-jai_west.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1034836\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5333333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49538/1034836-jai_west.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1034836\"><img alt=\"Jai in his Super Suit\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49538/1034836-jai_west.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49538/1034836-jai_west.jpg 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\"></a><figcaption>Jai in his Super Suit</figcaption></figure><p>to vibrate her molecules through solid objects. He and Iris then started working with their dad to be super-heroes, and following a Ferry Rescue caught the attention of the media.</p><h3>Flash: Rebirth</h3><p>During this arc, Barry Allen returns and Jai ultimately loses his connection to the Speed Force. Because of Jai and his sister, Iris's, relationship only one of them can have a connection to the Speed Force or they both suffer considerable amounts of pain. In a desperate attempt to save her brother from the pain, Iris takes the full blunt of the Speed Force herself. This causes Jai to lose all of his powers, while Iris gains complete control, becoming the next speedster generation. Following this, Jai has lost his connection to the speed force and has begun a quest to conquer every video game he can get his hands on.</p><h3>Road to Flashpoint</h3><p>Jai along with the rest of the Flash Family were at a family picnic, but Barry never showed up.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Jai has a few super powers.</p><p>Super Speed: Currently, this speed only manifests itself as the ability to temporarily acclelerate the growth of his muscles, allowing him also super strength.</p><p>Once, while emotionally distressed, dormant DNA in Jai's cells vibrated, causing strange transformations.</p><p>Mind-Link: Jai can also sync his Speed Force aura with his father's, causing him to fly behind Wally when Wally thinks of him. This power works in reverse, allowing Jai to summon Wally.</p>",

He morphed using the Triceratops Power Coin and commanded the Triceratops Zord, which transformed into the Unicorn Zord, The Wolf Ninjazord, and The Blue Shogunzord. When Billy was a kid he had taken a trip to the park and stopped at the lake and brought his sail boat with him. After he had set his boat in the lake he decided to try and recreat the whirlpool effect he had recently learned about. Billy stuck his finger in the lake and started to make swirling motions with it. This attracted the attention of a fish. Billy screamed and pulled his finger out of the water a fish was at the end of his finger, the fish had bit him. Billy screamed in terror. It would take billy several years before he overcame his fear of fish. He is brilliant and is a genious with technology. He usually can create machines to help the ranger's situation. He didn't know how to fight when he first became a ranger, but eventually learned and became a good martial artist. Billy stayed with the rangers even after he was no longer a Power Ranger and was like a mentor, creating Zords and Weapons for them.</p><p><strong>Cestro</strong></p><h3>Power Rangers: Zeo</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2224/157530-130475-blue-power-ranger.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-157530\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"288\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 288px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2224/157530-130475-blue-power-ranger.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-157530\"><img alt=\"Blue Zeo Ranger\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2224/157530-130475-blue-power-ranger.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2224/157530-130475-blue-power-ranger.jpg 288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\" data-width=\"288\"></a><figcaption>Blue Zeo Ranger</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rocky DeSantos</strong></p><p>After an attack on The Power Chamber, which utterly destroyed it, The Rangers discovered a secret underground base to</p><p>continue their fight to protect humanity. From then on, they became Power Rangers: Zeo. Rocky DeSantos(Steve Cardenas), the previous Red Ranger, became the Blue Zeo Ranger, commanding Zeozord III and Super Zeozord III. Rocky wasn't that vocal or focused on while being the blue ranger. He was second in command and was very impulsive. He was a great Martial Artists and friend to those around him. He was loyal and couragous, but at times didn't know his limits. He had various weapons including his Power Weapon, which was in the form of an Axe and the Jet Cycles each ranger had. He had a special power as well. This was his last run as a ranger and hasn't been seen again in the show.</p><h3>Power Rangers: Turbo</h3><p><strong>Justin Stewart</strong></p><p><i>''Hey Guys I'm The New Blue Ranger''</i></p><p><i>-Justin Stewart (Turbo:A Power Rangers Movie).</i></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80778/1919930-normal_viewingglobe_prt_30_173.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1919930\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.815\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80778/1919930-normal_viewingglobe_prt_30_173.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1919930\"><img alt=\"Blue Turbo Ranger\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80778/1919930-normal_viewingglobe_prt_30_173.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80778/1919930-normal_viewingglobe_prt_30_173.jpg 400w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80778/1919930-normal_viewingglobe_prt_30_173.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Blue Turbo Ranger\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80778/1919930-normal_viewingglobe_prt_30_173.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80778/1919930-normal_viewingglobe_prt_30_173.jpg 400w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80778/1919930-normal_viewingglobe_prt_30_173.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Blue Turbo Ranger</figcaption></figure><p>When an evil space pirate, <a href=\"/divatox/4005-68806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68806\">Divatox</a>, wants to use an intergalactic wizard to open a gateway to an uncharted island in hopes of marrying a living volcano, The Zeo Rangers changed into Power Rangers: Turbo.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2> <p> <br/>John Reinhardt was a boy genius, a philosopher, a traveler, a grinder, an author and a very rich man. He took on the Doktor Sleepless persona because no one listened to him as John Reinhardt and he had things to say, things about the world and the future. He chose the name \"Doktor Sleepless\" because at the time, he hadn't slept for a year. He's still a genius and all the other things, but he also seems to be more than a little insane.  John invented many of the technological items such as tags, the concept of Shrieky Girls, girls that have a sensational feed back link between them through either jewelry or a false fingernail etc. After dissapearing from the town of Heavenside for 3 years, he mysteriously returns and starts broadcasting his message over the radio to the town's counter culture, known as Grinders and reprinting the book The Darkening Sky. Eventually more and more people tune in to his social commentary about how they aren't living in the future that was promised to them. He deliberatelly instigates violence through the Grinders, and provides them with the technological means to do so, and also releases a Bio-weapon, St Theresa's Eyes, which causes the infected to have hallucinations of angels.<br/> <br/>As a child John witnessed his parent's souls being sucked out of them by a 10th dimensional being while reading from the Darkening Sky, effectivelly killing them. Originally he wanted to organize people to fight against these beings, rather than have the human race exist as a refrigerator, but has decided to end the world instead, starving the creatures out of spite, Heavenside is just the testing ground for his plans. <br/> <br/>Whether or not Doktor Sleepless is actually John Reinhardt or not has been brought to question many times within the series, as John Reinhardt is imprisoned in Cell #23 of the St. Thomas Institute in Heavenside, Doktor Sleepless has alluded that this may be a Tulpa, a being of pure thought that was created to stand in for him while he traveled the world. However, while having a psychotic moment in a bathroom where the mirror is talking to him, the mirror asks him who's the real John Reinhardt, the one in front of the mirror, the one in the cell, or the one that died two years ago. <br/> <br/>John Reinhardt also wrote for the blog Imminent.sea under the pseudonym of Professor Zero, writing about human-computer interface, street tech, and RFID Interface    </p>",

    "deck": "Kazuma Kuwabara is a character from the manga/anime Yu Yu Hakusho. Kuwabara is a junior high school student with above average spiritual awareness. He has the ability to manifest his spirit energy into a sword.",
    "description": "<p>Kazuma Kuwabara is mostly just called Kuwabara. Only his sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46482\" href=\"/shizuru-kuwabara/4005-46482/\" slug=\"shizuru-kuwabara\">Shizuru</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46481\" href=\"/yukina/4005-46481/\" slug=\"yukina\">Yukina</a>, who he loves, call him Kazuma. Kuwabara is the second best fighter in Sarayashiki Junior High School with his rival and friend, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45374\" href=\"/yusuke-urameshi/4005-45374/\" slug=\"yusuke-urameshi\">Yusuke</a> coming in first. He has a gang which he leads. It has him, Komada, Okubo, and Kirishima.</p><h2>Spirit Detective Saga</h2><p>In the beginning, Kuwabara is one of the people that appear at Yusuke's wake when he dies. He is angry and upset that he won't have the opportunity to finally defeat Yusuke in a fight. Later on, Yusuke possesses Kuwabara's body so he can talk to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46290\" href=\"/keiko-yukimura/4005-46290/\" slug=\"keiko-yukimura\">Keiko</a>, who is a classmate and longtime personal friend of Yusuke's, so she can defend his body so he can come back to life.</p><p>Before Yusuke comes back to life, Kuwabara goes through some trials and tribulations with a couple of teachers at the Junior High who have some sort of personal vendetta against him. Throughout the trouble, Kuwabara shows incredible loyalty and dedication to his friends by not fighting back against some bullies from another school. Rather, he simply takes their beatings. The disembodied Yusuke helps Kuwabara through all of this by communicating with him via dreams.</p><p>Awhile after Kuwabara goes to the home of Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46197\" href=\"/genkai/4005-46197/\" slug=\"genkai\">Genkai</a>, an old woman that is one of the greatest human psychics ever, with Yusuke on an assignment from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46278\" href=\"/koenma/4005-46278/\" slug=\"koenma\">Koenma</a>. He goes their to ask her about his spirit awareness which has always been abnormally high for a human, but he accidentally enters himself into her tournament, the winner of which will become her successor. He wins the first three rounds, which focus more on spiritual awareness and power than fighting, easily. During his fight with a swordsman named Musashi he discovers the ability to use the spirit sword by focusing his spirit energy into Musashi's broken sword, thus creating his signature spirit sword. His winning streak comes to an end when a powerful demon named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46443\" href=\"/rando/4005-46443/\" slug=\"rando\">Rando</a> fights him. Rando shrinks Kuwabara using a legendary chant and nearly crushes him to death beneath his foot. Yusuke defeats the demon, thus winning the tournament, but he is injured badly in the process. Kuwabara is able to transfer his own spirit energy into the wounded Yusuke to save him.</p><p>Upon hearing about Yusuke's assignment to stop the Saint Beasts of Maze Castle, Kuwabara demands to go along on the journey. Once there, he is the second to fight one of the Saint Beasts after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45993\" href=\"/yoko-kurama/4005-45993/\" slug=\"yoko-kurama\">Kurama</a> defeated Genbu. Byakko the White Tiger, Kuwabara's enemy, uses strands of his own hair to summon beasts to fight Kuwabara. Kuwabara is able to hold them off for a while with only his spirit sword, but the creatures' sheer strength proves to be too much for the human. Realizing that he'll be beaten under these circumstances, Kuwabara skewers the beasts in a circle on his spirit sword, in a technique he called the \"Spirit Sword Monster Beast Donut.\" He then goes toe to toe with the demon Byakko. Byakko uses his demon powers to absorb Kuwabara's spirit energy from his spirit sword. Again overpowered, Kuwabara relies on his wits to win. Kuwabara super-charges his spirit sword, which overloads Byakko, causing the demon to explode and seemingly die. However, he returns to fight Kuwabara again in a lair of molten lava. Byakko employs a new ranged technique which leaves Kuwabara to jump from ledge to ledge. At one point, Kuwabara uses his spirit sword as a pole vault to avoid falling in the lava. In a moment of desperation, Kuwabara dives at Byakko, intending to fall into the lava with the demon. However, through a stroke of dumb luck, Kuwabara becomes suspended by a bandage from his ribs to a platform, saving his life while Byakko falls into the lava. Later on, Yusuke goes on to fight the leader of the Saint Beasts, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46045\" href=\"/suzaku/4005-46045/\" slug=\"suzaku\">Suzaku</a>, while Kuwabara, Kurama, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45368\" href=\"/hiei/4005-45368/\" slug=\"hiei\">Hiei</a> fight a host of harvested humans, which are essentially zombie-like husks. After Yusuke's triumph over Suzaku, Kuwabara again saves Yusuke's life, only this time, he transfers a portion of his life energy to Yusuke instead of his spirit energy.</p><p>After the events at Maze Castle, Kuwabara and Yusuke go on a rescue mission to save the ice apparition Yukina who, unbeknownst to Kuwabara, Yusuke, and herself, is Hiei's younger sister. Yukina had been kidnapped by the crime lord Tarukane because her tears turn into extraordinarily valuable gems known as hiruseki stones. Kuwabara plays a key role in finding Yukina by leading the group of himself, Yusuke, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46257\" href=\"/botan/4005-46257/\" slug=\"botan\">Botan</a> by his pinky string, which appears as a thin red string tied to his pinky at one end and presumably Yukina at the other. It is unknown whether this is a manifestation of his spirit energy or simply a gimmick. Once the group reaches Tarukane's domain, they are met with hostility from several demon guards. Tarukane holds a video conference call with a group known as the Black Book Club, an organization of extremely wealthy individuals who gamble on matters of the spirit and demon worlds, and begins betting on the outcomes of various battles as Yusuke, Kuwabara, and Botan make their way to freeing Yukina. All the members of the club bet against Kuwabara and Yusuke consistently, except for the mysterious <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46485\" href=\"/sakyo/4005-46485/\" slug=\"sakyo\">Sakyo</a>. Because of this, Tarukane loses a vast amount of money to Sakyo while only reclaiming a meager portion from the other gamblers. Kuwabara and Yusuke consistently win, beating down all of the lower-leveled guards and even <a data-ref-id=\"4060-46452\" href=\"/the-triad/4060-46452/\" slug=\"the-triad\">the Triad</a>, which were supposed to be the strongest trio of the Apparition Gang. Yusuke defeats <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46449\" href=\"/miyuki/4005-46449/\" slug=\"miyuki\">Miyuki</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46450\" href=\"/inmaki/4005-46450/\" slug=\"inmaki\">Inmaki</a> on his own, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46451\" href=\"/gokumonki/4005-46451/\" slug=\"gokumonki\">Gokumonki</a> is lain low by a spiritually-charged kick from both Kuwabara and Yusuke at the same time. When Kuwabara and Yusuke get past all of the lower guards, they finally come face to face with Tarukane's trump card, the Toguro brothers. Elder <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46050\" href=\"/toguro-ani/4005-46050/\" slug=\"toguro-ani\">Toguro</a> uses his abilities to become a sword or shield for Younger <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46049\" href=\"/toguro-ototo/4005-46049/\" slug=\"toguro-ototo\">Toguro</a> with his super-strength to wield. However, Yusuke fires his spirit gun into Kuwabara's back, propelling him with his spirit sword forward. Kuwabara lands a direct hit on Younger Toguro, seemingly killing him. Kuwabara and Yusuke then free Yukina. She is particularly grateful to Kuwabara, comforting him when he laments the deeds that humans had done to her. It is not until later that it is revealed that neither of the Toguro brothers had actually died in the fight; rather, it was all a setup by Sakyo.</p><p>Later, Younger Toguro appears to Yusuke to invite him to the Dark Tournament, a tournament held for demons to compete and the Black Book Club to gamble again. Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45993\" href=\"/yoko-kurama/4005-45993/\" slug=\"yoko-kurama\">Kurama</a> all must attend. The team's fifth fighter is the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46197\" href=\"/genkai/4005-46197/\" slug=\"genkai\">Masked Fighter</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Kuwabara's family has a strong spiritual sense and this was passed on to him as well. He was able to sense ghosts at least since he was in elementary school. During a moment of desperation during Genkai's tournament, Kuwabara was able to manifest his Spirit Sword only needing a piece of sacred wood as a channeling point. During further training Kuwabara was able to make variations on his Spirit Sword like being able to extend it, use it as a pole vault, and firing shards, all without the aid of a prop. Kuwabara has always been a street fighter though his skill was always below Yusuke's, but he was still able to keep coming back for more. After his powers went into hibernation following the dark tournament he gained his ultimate move the Dimensional Sword where he could literally slice through dimensions. This gave him power equivalent to that of an A-Class Demon. Kuwabara was last show as the strongest spiritually aware human on the planet.</p><p><b>Singature Moves</b></p><p><b>Spirit Sword:</b> Kuwabara's first power, he summons a yellow sword constructed of his spirit energy. This energy sword is strong enough to slice through most substances.</p><p><b>Spirit Relfection:</b> Kuwabara is able to deflect energy blasts in a baseball style by using his spirit sword.</p><p><b>Spirit Sword Javelin:</b> Kuwabara is able to increase the length of his spirit sword to use as a a javelin for extra distance.</p><p><b>Double Spirit Sword:</b> Kuwabara is able to summon two spirit swords for double the attack power, one for each hand.</p><p><b>Spiritual Strike:</b> Kuwabara transforms his spirit sword into a whip like weapon that can bend and extend to hit his target. While it is in this form, Kuwabara is able to manipulate the sword, choosing where it goes.</p><p><b>Spirit Shuriken:</b> Kuwabara summons many shard of his spirit sword which he fires from his hand as a long range attack.</p><p><b>Trial Sword:</b> Using the hilt given to him by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46059\" href=\"/suzuka/4005-46059/\" slug=\"suzuka\">Suzuka</a>, Kuwabara is able to summon this blade that can be shaped into different shapes. The blade also surrounds his body with an electric aura to increase his offense and defense. This technique is what enabled him to manipulate his spirit sword into the spirit flyswatter.</p><p><b>Dimension Sword:</b> The ultimate form of Kuwabara's spirit sword that can literally cut through dimensions, psychic territories, and energy barriers with ease. Kuwabara can also halve distances using the blade giving him a form of teleportation.</p>",

    "description": "<b>Anu</b> is a member of the <b><a data-ref-id=\"4060-46105\" href=\"/annunaki/4060-46105/\" slug=\"annunaki\">  Annunaki gods</a></b> that were worshipped in  <strong>Ancient Mesopotamia</strong> . <br/> <br/>  Anu is the eldest son of the Elder Gods Anshar, god of sky, and Kishar, goddess of earth. Anshar and Kishar were the grand-children of the great sea-goddess Tiamat. Often taking the form of a great dragon, Tiamat was the ultimate power of the ocean who had coupled with the freshwater god Apsu and gave birth to a lethal progeny of creatures who ravaged the earth and terrified ancient mortals. (Tiamat might be an ancient name for the primeval earth-goddess, Gaea, but this is unconfirmed). <p> Among her children was the ancient god Alalu who Anu overthrew as ruler of Ancient Sumeria by fatally wounding him. Anu usurped his role as ruler of the gods as his brother Ea fought Apsu, Tiamat’s lover, for control of the seas of earth. Anu and Ea split portions of Earth between them with their sister Eriskegal ruling the underworld (Some references call Eriskegal a daughter of Anu rather than his sister.) Anu had numerous children who were worshipped as gods by the Sumerian people. Among them were the four storm-gods, Enlil, Hadad, Ninurta and Martu, his sons by the exiled Titaness Dione who he had accepted as his wife. He adopted her daughter, Aphrodite, as the goddess Inanna without any knowledge of her parentage, or perhaps to irk Zeus, Ruler of the Olympian gods, with whom the Gods of Mesopotamia had been warring with for years. </p> <p> Sometime in the 25th Millennium BC, Anu eventually noticed that mortals were becoming lazy and corrupt and were allowing the temples of the gods to be neglected. Some of the gods tried to dissuade his decision, but he proceeded to destroy them all by a flood and sent Enlil to inflict earth with a deluge of rain to cover the world. Ea, meanwhile, had located an honorable man named Utnapistim and his wife Ziusudra and instructed them on how to survive the flood by creating an ark to ride it out. Utnapishtim loaded his family and all the clean animals into the ark to survive. After seven days of torrential rain, much of the known world of the Sumerian Empire had become flooded. Utnapishtim and his family eventually landed safely upon the top of Mount Nisir (now known as modern Ararat). As the waters receded, he made a sacrifice to the sun god Shamash. Now realizing the rashness of his decision, Anu allowed Utnapishtim to live on earth and allowed Enlil to bestow on him immortality.  Utnapishtim and his family started repopulating the earth with new respect to the gods. </p> <p> Inanna, meanwhile, fell in love with Dumuzi, the grain god, but Eriskegal, Queen of the underworld, for reasons of her own, kidnapped the handsome god. Inanna went down to the underworld to retrieve him, but Eriskegal disgraced her by having her leave an article of clothing at each of then ten gates of the underworld. By time Inanna entered Eriskegal’s court, she was completely naked and vulnerable to be taken prisoner. Anu sent Enlil to free her and Enlil found her by ripping the gates asunder from the underworld. Inanna was returned to earth, but Dumuzi had to stay behind. Anu, however, arbitrated that Inanna and Dumuzi could share six months out of the year on earth to be together.    </p> <p> At some point, Adapa, the mortal son of Ea and ruler of Eridu, was displeased by the storm-god Ninurta because he had sent the south wind to turn over his royal boat. He shot an arrow into the sky that injured Ninurta and Ninurta revealed his injury to Anu. Angered, Anu wanted to kill the disrespectful king, but Ea brought Adapa to him to him to avoid any bloody consequences. Anu meanwhile decided on other means to get justice on his injured son. As Adapa arrived, he offered him some of the food of the gods out of courtesy. Suspecting it to be the food of the dead, Adapa refused. Anu then revealed to the mortal king that he had refused the food of the gods and because of it now all mortals would have to suffer eventual old age and death.    </p> <p> Anu, however, was soon overthrown by his son Enlil, as king of the gods and ruler of Sumeria. Anu cursed him to have three miserable sons for his disobedience and escaped to the sky where he separated the heavens and the earth. Anu welcomed most of the gods into this new realm he called Celestial Dilmun, but Enlil, now calling himself Dagon, was soon overthrown by his brother Hadad, now called Baal. He confined both of them to Earth and after both of them were ousted as rulers, he confined both of them to separate kingdoms in the underworld. From the heavens, Anu reclaimed his role as King of the gods. </p> <p> Tiamat by now was slain by the god Marduk working in tandem with his father, Ea and Anu, Ruler of the Mesopotamian Gods. He became ruler of the earth under the now ascendant Babylonian Empire by replacing Baal-Hadad. Anu and Ea together split Tiamat’s corpse in half and used it to permanently bind the separation of heaven and earth. (In later myth, they created heaven and earth from her remains)  </p> <p> The Babylonian Empire was soon replaced by the Assyrian Empire who revered the war-god Nergal as their patron deity in his role as Assur. They never accomplished the power of the previous Sumerian or Babylonian Empires and were constantly trying to hold their power against invading tribes and by the Phoenicians from the west who worshipped many of the same gods under different names. The conflict in interest over their worshippers divided the interest of many of the Mesopotamian gods. Anu also realized that there was unrest from the growing Judaism Religion, which erroneously accused many of the former Sumerian gods as unholy gods or demons. With this amount of concern and interior unrest amongst the gods, Anu was unprepared for the power of the Olympian gods from Greece entering Phoenicia.   The god Zeus in particular fell in love with the Phoenician princess Europa and spirited her off to Crete where she gave birth to the god-king Minos who founded the Minoan Civilization. Anu was finally able to route the interest of the Mesopotamian gods in the direction of the invading Olympian Gods as they both fought to withhold their perspective worship rites and establish boundaries on earth that they could claim. Asherah drawn out of loyalty to both the perspective pantheons arbitrated the peace between Zeus and Anu and eventually came to a truce. Part of the truce was that Zeus could retrieve Inanna, formerly Aphrodite, and bestow upon his daughter her true birthright as an Olympian Goddess. The Olympians promised to stay out of lands that the Greeks invaded and the Annunaki pledged to not interfere in the affairs of the Greeks. </p> <p> The worship of the Annunaki meanwhile continued to wane, however, under Judaism and the now developing Christian religion. Anu began to believe he had been cheated in the deal with Zeus and Zeus started to feel an uprising from the Annunaki. As tension became unbearable and another war between the gods came close, Zeus found a way out. The Romans started slaughtering Christians in the names of the gods of Olympus. Dissatisfied with the bloodshed, he ordered the Olympian gods to break off ties with earth completely and cease interest in worship rites. The edict came to a surprise to Anu even as Zeus in a humble position presented the dilemma to Anu and proposed the same fate to his pantheon. The pact cemented their truce even as gods like Ares, Dagon, Apollo and others refused to cooperate. In 1000 AD, the Celestials returned to Earth. Long having an interest in human beings and their development, they ordered all the gods to stop trafficking completely with mortals. Their warning cemented the non-interference rule that Zeus and Anu had began and even spread it across the other pantheons of Earth. With the heads of the other pantheons of Earth that were or had been worshipped by mortals of Earth, Anu, Zeus and the other godheads discussed the potential threat the Celestials posed to Earth.  </p> <p> Arbitrating on behalf of Anu, Zeus met with Odin of the Asgardian Gods and Vishnu of the Hindu Gods and they went to confront the Third Host of the Celestials on behalf of all the gods of Earth. However, Odin and Zeus were pledged not to interfere with the Celestials when the Celestials threatened to seal off the inter-dimensional portals connecting the god’s dimensions to Earth. As a result of this pledge, the Annunaki had to lessen their contact with Earth although a few of them such as Ninurta and Shamash have masqueraded as mortals and spent time living with the human beings on Earth.  </p> <p> Odin, meanwhile, had withdrawn all the life forces of the Asgardians except that of his son Thor into the Destroyer created to oppose the Celestials. Odin’s spirit then entered the Destroyer and animated it into doing battle with the Fourth Host. They annihilated the Destroyer, but judged in favor of humanity’s favor when Gaea presented them with twelve genetically advanced human beings, the “Young Gods.” Thor meanwhile contracted Anu as per his pact with Odin and Anu bestowed upon him a fragment of the life forces required to restore the Asgardians to life after the destruction of the Destroyer. </p> <p> In recent years, both Ninurta and Shamash have become renowned to the modern citizens of Iraq as superheroes. The modern-day descendants of their former worshippers do not actually believe them to be the actual gods of myth, but merely super-powered individuals paying homage to ancient myths. Considering the political turmoil in the area today, Ninurta has attempted to obtain from his father help in trying to bestow peace to the region and restore it to the glory seen in the past. Anu has had no part in these requests because in his mind it is the responsibility of mortal man to solve their own problems and find answers for the destruction that mankind has created. </p>",

Shrewd and power hungry, she has on many occasions impersonated several other beings, most notably the Mesopotamian Death Goddess Ereshkigal to gain advantage. At some point in her life, she became aware of the being the <a href=\"/living-tribunal/4005-6811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6811\">Living Tribunal,</a> during travels and exploration of the Universe. This knowledge affected her profoundly and she felt dissatisfaction at this new knowledge, of how the multiverse worked. Ereshkigal set about accumulating the power and means of liberating herself from the cosmic cycle she felt trapped within. With time and cunning, Ereshkigal managed to acquire the extremely powerful <a href=\"/star-brand/4055-43199/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-43199\">Star Brand</a> weapon. A weapon that grants virtually any and all power to its user. With such a weapon she was able to gain audience with several powerful abstract beings including the Living Tribunal. Perhaps with not enough power to force their hand, but enough power to make them apprehensive about dismissing her threats, a tournament with representatives or champions of Living Tribunal and Ereshkigal would compete, with the respective champions winning sealing the fate of who they were to represent. <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a> foiled Ereshkigal's plan however as her champion, realizing the consequences of his victory, he threw his match with the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer.</a></p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Ereshkigal was created by <a href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\">Roy Thomas</a>, <a href=\"/john-buscema/4040-3800/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3800\">John Buscema</a> and <a href=\"/chic-stone/4040-8363/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-8363\">Chic Stone</a> in 1979 and first appeared in <a href=\"/thor/4050-2294/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2294\">Thor # 284.</a> In the Marvel Universe, Ereshkigal is both the name of a Sumerian Death Goddess and that of a Deviant posing as her. Since they are drawn identically the difference is subtle.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Thor Deviant Saga</h3><p>The Deviants are in dire states, with no more births and much the male population impotent, the future of the Deviants looks uncertain and several power struggles for leadership break out. Cunning and as opportunistic as ever Ereshkigal plots to win the favor of her people and authority over them in this troubled state. As such Ereshkigal seeks powers and artifacts in the ruins of <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard,</a> attracting the <a href=\"/asgardian-gods/4060-41205/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\">Asgardian</a> Thunder god, <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor's</a> attention. After finding herself attacked by several Asgardian mystic defense systems, Thor must ward them off. With Thor preoccupied with ensuring her safety, Ereshkigal steals a mysterious and small orb like device, that turns out to be the <a href=\"/unbinding-stone-of-oshemar/4055-57045/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57045\">Unbinding Stone of Oshemar.</a> Not realizing its true destructive nature she attempts to use it to bid favor with fellow Deviants. Her lack of know how on the device proves her failing as she is rejected in favor of the Deviant <a href=\"/kro/4005-11939/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11939\">Kro.</a> Dejected, she retreated to try and unlock the secrets of her stolen device, still unaware of its extremely destructive nature. Approached by Kro who triggers its power, a deadly consuming destructive force is unleashed, eventually halted by the efforts of Thor and the Eternal <a href=\"/phastos/4005-20591/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20591\">Phastos.</a></p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Ereshkigal is a Deviant and has powers as such. Superhuman strength, speed, durability, senses, and healing. She possesses an extremely long life span. She can alter her form with shape-shifting. She also has two large bat like wings that grant her flight.

Marduk was also part of the Gods of Mesopotamia who are a race of super-humanly powerful beings with humanoid traits and were once worshiped by several of the races and cultures from circa 19,000 BC. Marduk is depicted as the God of Storms and was the patron deity of Babylon, who slowly rose to power as the head of the Babylonian pantheon. He is a complex God associated with prophecy, resurrection and thunder. He rose to power during a civil war between the gods and their prodigy known as the Igigi. It was Marduk who conquered the primeval goddess Tiamat, elevating him to the status of God-king, ruling over the Heaven and the Earth. All nature, including man, owed its existence to him. He is the son of Enki, husband of Sarpanit and father of Nabu. In the myths he rides a chariot pulled by four poisonous horses. Marduk was said to have 50 names.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-5039447\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039447-marduk_6d-blk-badge.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.97860962566845\" data-width=\"1122\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1122px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039447-marduk_6d-blk-badge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5039447\"><img alt=\"symbol for the Babylonan god Marduk\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/134753/5039447-marduk_6d-blk-badge.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039447-marduk_6d-blk-badge.jpg 1122w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/134753/5039447-marduk_6d-blk-badge.jpg 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134753/5039447-marduk_6d-blk-badge.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>symbol for the Babylonan god Marduk</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He defeated Tiamat in the <em>Enuma Elish</em> by immobilizing her with the powerful winds while she broke into an unstoppable rage and then killed her in battle with arrows from his magical bow. After defeating Tiamat he battled and killed Kingu her son and chief of her army. Marduk than took the Tablets of Destiny from Kingu to affirm his supremacy in the universe. Marduk was said to throw lightning from the heavens and send heavy rains to flood to land of man. Seen as an almost messianic figure to the Babylonians and is said he would visit Babylon again. He demanded he be made chief deity and have authority over all creation after defeating and mutilating Tiamat as well as creating the universe with her mutilated body parts. Marduk also was noted in ancient lore to have created humans out of Kingu’s blood, and made them to be slaves to the gods.</p><h4>Known Relations:</h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ra (father), Damkina (mother), Anu (uncle), Mami, <a title=\"Ereshkigal (Goddess)\" href=\"http://marvel.com/universe/Ereshkigal_%28Goddess%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ereshkigal</a> (aunts), Zarpandit (first wife), Nebo (son), Nisasba, Nanshe, Ninsar, Uttu, (half-sisters), Enkimdu, Enbilulu, Asnan, Asarlubi (half-brothers), Enlil (Dagon), <a title=\"Ba'al (Ba'al Hadad)\" href=\"http://marvel.com/universe/Ba%27al_%28Ba%27al_Hadad%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ba'al</a>, Hadad, Ninurta, <a title=\"Martu (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://marvel.com/universe3zx/index.php?title=Martu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martu</a>, Nusku, <a title=\"Nergal (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://marvel.com/universe3zx/index.php?title=Nergal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nergal</a>, Gibil, Kinyras (cousins)</p><h2>History in Comics</h2><h3>Modern History</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Marduk has been an inspiration in several comic titles throughout the years and each character published with his name has taken his aspects as a god of the air from ancient history.</p><h3>Essential Story-lines</h3><h4><strong>Marvel Comics</strong></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The entity known Marduk as the god of storms is one of the ancient beings calling themselves the Annunaki.

Born fully mature and with great power over 5,000 years ago, he was worshiped as a deity in ancient Mesopotamia. Marduk had taken over as the ruler of the Annunaki Gods and he succeeded Ba'al after his battle with the ancient dragoness Tiamat. Sometime during his reign the priesthood of Marduk placed a griffin to stand guard over the mystical Book of the Vishanti for centuries. With the onset of other diverse religions in the world the longtime worship of the Annunaki waned and they disappeared into antiquities.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-5039385\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039385-mardk13.gif\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.83333333333333\" data-width=\"324\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 324px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039385-mardk13.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5039385\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px\" data-width=\"324\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039385-mardk13.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039385-mardk13.gif 324w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039385-mardk13.gif\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039385-mardk13.gif 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px\" data-width=\"324\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Around the time of 980 A.D. Marduk sought out the gods worshiped by the Norse and battled <a title=\"Thor (Thor Odinson)\" href=\"http://marvel.com/universe/Thor_%28Thor_Odinson%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thor</a>, the regions god of storms. After the battle Thor was the victor and than stripped Marduk of his godly status and exiled him to Earth. However Marduk had retained a tiny of his powers as a former deity, including the ability to claim the souls of humans by contact, Marduk operated among humanity, joined by fellow gods Aqhat and Papa. To reclaim his lost power, he designed the Genesis Well, which could distribute the souls of mortals to him in a water-like state for him to bathe in and consume.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Marduk began various schemes, posing as curator Zoltan Nestor. He met and manipulated Destroyer (Roger Aubrey) to keep the V-Battalion from uncovering his schemes.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Marduk took over Oracle Inc. after its acquisition by Stark-Fujikawa. He began pouring its resources into Flag-Smasher's group ULTIMATUM. Marduk hoped to cause massive loss of life and absorb the souls of the fallen combatants, restoring him to his former power. When Aubrey interfered he took his soul. Citizen V (John Watkins III) battled Marduk, learning that the Genesis Well continually revived Marduk. Watkins overloaded the machines, apparently destroying Marduk.</p><h4>Powers and Abilities:</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-5039442\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039442-20.gif\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.58670520231214\" data-width=\"346\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 346px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039442-20.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5039442\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" data-width=\"346\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039442-20.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039442-20.gif 346w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039442-20.gif\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5039442-20.gif 346w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" data-width=\"346\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Before his godlike attributes were stripped away by the Asgardians Marduk possessed tremendous powers. Marduk took power from other beings he took over, adding them to his own.After being stripped of his godhood, Marduk retained some physical superhuman abilities; he could claim human souls on contact, taking that soul at any time of his choosing, By ingesting souls, he restored some of his lost godly powers, including an increased lifespan and wound healing. Those souls are placed in the Genesis Well. He can also drain others of energy via his equipment and the waters of the Genesis Well. With the aid of the Genesis Well, when in contact with its waters, Marduk was able to heal from any wound, and siphon power from others by draining their lives.

Crusader was accepted in the program and was located at Camp Hammond, the training-ground for new recruits.

He noticed this because these were a good substitute for a famous Skrull food, so both Crusader and Noll were eating it. When they ran into each other, Crusader saw Noll's food choice first, and realized he was a Skrull. Not wanting Noll to know HE was a skrull, Crusader used the Freedom Ring to change his meal into grapefruit. Crusader did not know how to reveal Noll without everyone seeing he was a Skrull and attacking him, so he kept his mouth shut.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Secret Invasion and Death</h3><figure style=\"width: 657px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-666528\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/666528-let_freedom_ring_3.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.68036529680365\" data-width=\"657\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/666528-let_freedom_ring_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-666528\"><img alt=\"Z'Reg being the hero killing the Skrull Noll, moments before his untimely own death\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/666528-let_freedom_ring_3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/666528-let_freedom_ring_3.jpg 657w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/666528-let_freedom_ring_3.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/666528-let_freedom_ring_3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Z'Reg being the hero killing the Skrull Noll, moments before his untimely own death</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the story arc \"<a href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\"> Secret Invasion</a>\" Crusader took the human's side, though they did not know he was a Skrull.

Believing this equation was so pure and perfect, he gained a high status among his people.</p><p>But another scientist observed another phisical event which was not possible to include in the equation, so the Geometer left this universe to seek another one more perfect, which wouldn't betray his mathematical perfection.</p><p>For the next millions of years, the Geometer spent his life to modify the met universes to adjust the imperfections and make them the mathematical perfection.

    "deck": "The master computer hacker of the bunch, Eric is the only Troubleshooter with a serious criminal record, attempting to translate his skill at breaking into computers into real buildings. After the Law set him straight, he went to M.I.T. to turn his life around",
    "description": "<p>As a youth, Eric Chin was fascinated with computers. He played with them constantly as a child, and learned how they ticked at a very early age. However, his fascination for computers turned to computer hacking, as he learned how easy (and fun!) it is to break into other people's machines to learn their dark secrets. Most impressive with a Commodore 64, to be sure. </p><p> <br/>Eric got really good at it, though, and decided he wanted to try breaking into real places as well; of course, this didn't go as well as his online hijinks, and he got caught. Luckily for him, however, Eric didn't go to jail (due to his age), and was able to resume a normal, crime-free life from then on until his college days, when he became a part of M.I.T.'s Troubleshooters. </p><p>An odd duck of a clique, the Troubleshooters were a gaggle of techno-geeks and other high tech wannabees, who happened to be at the absolute top of their classes at M.I.T. A hard working student himself, Eric couldn't help but get sucked into the eddies of mirth and mayhem that surrounded the Troubleshooters and their bizarre technological pranks on campus. </p><p>As a Troubleshooter, Eric found himself eventually helping one of the team's favorite instructors, Professor Jenny Swensen, to break into Krotze International. Her father worked there until his mysterious death, and Jenny needed to get proof that the company killed him on purpose. Liking the idea of the challenge, the five Troubleshooters helped her get in. </p><p>Once there, the team discovered something else altogether: Doctor Karl Swensen's Mark 2 M.A.X. armor suit. Knowing why it was hidden, Jenny then stole it and the mobile laboratory it was built in, taking the Troubleshooters with her into the back woods of Boston. While there, the Troubleshooters began to break down the M.A.X. technology in order to see how it worked. </p><p>Once they understood how it worked, the Troubleshooters started producing practical applications of the heuristic breakthroughs of Doctor Swensen; well, all but Eric. Unlike his fellows, Eric wasn't sure that this was such a good idea, and as such, he never built himself up a high tech M.A.X. toy. And this, in the end, saved his life from the anger of Steel Hawk. </p><p>This assassin, in the employ of the Club, was working to destroy Jenny Swensen. The Troubleshooters, trying to get her out of jail, went to his place looking for proof of his involvement in the murder he'd framed her for, on a lark. Of course, at the man's place, they also found evidence that the man was out to kill the visiting English Prime Minister, and set out to stop this dastardly deed! </p><p>The Troubleshooters succeeded at this, but gained Steel Hawk's enmity, and the villain tracked the college students down and smacked them silly, killing Andy and maiming Ferris. However, having lacked any actual high tech toys, Eric managed to avoid Steel Hawk's vengeance. Though he wasn't affected by the carnage, Eric was at ground zero when it happened, so he rode with Tim to the hospital. </p><p> Eric's further activities have yet to be chronicled... </p>",

    "description": "<p>Like the other four Troubleshooters, Timothy Ferris was an M.I.T. student that was enrolled in Jenny Swensen's advanced engineering classes. Tim and the other four Troubleshooters were the best students in her class, and sort of became friends with her over time (they sort of hung out with her when possible, to learn as much as they could). Especially once her father died. </p><p>You see, her father was developing this ultra-advanced heuristics technology in order to help mankind, and Jenny believed the man was killed for it by his employer (for holding out). She needed to break into the facility to find out the truth, and like the others, Tim decided that he had to help Jenny out (after all, the five students felt like they owed her for all her help in school). </p><p>The Troubleshooters managed to get Jenny in, and left with the late Doctor Swensen's mobile laboratory and the Mark 2 M.A.X. Armor he'd developed. Though Doctor Swensen's former employer tried on several occasions to get the equipment back, Jenny managed to keep him at bay with the help of the Troubleshooters, who were busy breaking down the M.A.X. tech all the while. </p><p>Once they figured out how it ticked, the Troubleshooters started building new applications for it; Tim's was the Fast-Back M.A.X. partial exoskeleton, which allowed him to run at incredible speeds (over 140 miles per hour)! The Troubleshooters used these suits to help Jenny out on several occasions, both before and after she was framed for murder and thrown in jail. </p><p>While Jenny was in jail, the Troubleshooters managed to foil the assassination of the British Prime Minister, who was in Boston on a Christmas visit. This angered the would be assassin, Steel Hawk, who managed to figure out who the Troubleshooters were, and decided to get even... a lot. He set traps for all the amateur techies, starting with Timothy Ferris. </p><p>Steel Hawk ambushed the man with his machine guns, and when Tim started running away with his Fast-Back on, the man launched a grenade right into his path. Not able to dodge in time, Timothy ran right into the detonating explosive, an act which trashed his legs permanently, and Steel Hawk left the burning youth for dead. However, Tim didn't die. </p><p>The authorities managed to get him to the hospital, where they amputated his legs; drastic, to be sure, but they did save his life. It is assumed that Tim eventually recovered from this and got on with his life, but his further adventures have yet to be chronicled; he and the Troubleshooters have since faded into obscurity... </p>",

    "description": "<p>Eduardo Giotti was an engineering student at M.I.T., a student that was at the top of his class, along with four other students of note. These five youths, known on campus as the Troubleshooters, were notorious techno-pranksters, and were good friends with their main engineering instructor, Jenny Swensen. Of course, Giotti liked Jenny more than the others; in fact, he had a crush on her. </p><p>As such, when her father was killed, and she had to break into Krotze International to get proof that his death wasn't accidental, Giotti was the first Troubleshooter to offer his aid to the beleaguered instructor. The others eventually went along with the plan, and helped Jenny to get inside, where she and her students discovered her father's greatest work: the Mark 2 M.A.X. armor! </p><p>In order to prove that Krotze was a bad man, Jenny took the armor and the mobile lab it was built in, though Krotze launched several aborted attempts to retrieve both. During this time, Giotti and the other Troubleshooters were breaking down the M.A.X. technology, and Giotti managed to build the first derivative suit from it: the Strong-Arms partial exoskeleton. </p><p>Giotti used this thing in order to help deflect Krotze's tech retrieval scheme, though he did get beat up several times in the process. Further, after the other Troubleshooters (save for Eric) also built up M.A.X. suits, they managed to deflect an assassination attempt against the visiting English Prime Minister. Of course, this caused them some hardship down the road. </p><p>You see, the Steel Hawk, that assassin whose plan they foiled, was kinda ticked off about that. And, on top of that, he decided to get even, which he was able to do once he managed to figure out just who the Troubleshooters were. He started by taking down Ferris and killing poor Andy. In this fight, however, Giotti and Terry managed to defeat the man... barely. </p><p>Enraged, the two remaining (and effective) Troubleshooters sought him out in turn, breaking into the F.B.I. data base to find all the info they needed on the man. Armed with the info they needed, the two tracked him down and put the beat down on him, and how! In fact, Giotti would've killed Steel Hawk if he wasn't saved at the last minute by his female companion. </p><p>At it sat, he broke practically every bone in the assassin's body, and apparently inflicted some brain damage upon the man, effectively ruining his career as a terrorist and assassin for the Club. After this incident, Giotti and Terry got together, as the girl apparently had a big ol' crush on him, and with Jenny gone, he had nobody else to be lusting after... </p>",

    "description": "<p>An exceptionally bright engineering student at M.I.T., Andy Meadows eventually found himself in a bizarre group of people, a group that was really, really, really into high tech gear (though not as much as himself, mind you). They were the Troubleshooters, the best M.I.T. had to offer in 1986, and Andy was one of their brightest members, hands down! </p><p> <br/>As an engineering student, it was inevitable that Andy would end up in Jenny Swensen's engineering classes, as she was the head professor in that area on campus. Due to this fact, he and the other Troubleshooters couldn't help but get involved with Jenny's efforts to retrieve her father's work after his death, which she believed was due to foul play on his employer, Fritz Krotze's, part. </p><p>Adoring Jenny like the other four Troubleshooters, Andy indeed helped Jenny retrieve Doctor Swensen's work, the prototype for the Mark 2 M.A.X. Armor. This involved breaking into Krotze International, of course, but Andy and the Troubleshooters nonetheless succeeded in their mission, stealing the armor and the lab that it was built in (it was mobile). </p><p>After defeating one of Krotze's flunkies later on (who was piloting the Mark 1 M.A.X. prototype), Andy was instrumental in helping Jenny break down the M.A.X. technology in order to determine exactly how it worked. Of course, this work helped the Troubleshooters develop partial M.A.X. suits all their own, which would prove to be an incredibly bad thing down the road. </p><p>Eventually, the forces moving against Jenny Swensen landed her in jail, and the five students that were the Troubleshooters decided to use their technology to help Jenny, becoming accidental heroes in the process, having learned of a plot to slay the English Prime Minister in their search for proof of Jenny's innocence. During this mission, Andy debuted his M.A.X. tech: the Beam-Splitter! </p><p>After this, however, the other Troubleshooters decided that being heroes was too dangerous, and went to give their M.A.X. tech back to Jenny (who'd since gotten out of jail). Andy was very, very reluctant to do so, though, as he'd begun to like the laser weapon he'd built, as well as the idea of being a hero. In fact, he told the others this when Steel Hawk struck. </p><p>The villain who tried to kill the Prime Minister, Steel Hawk wanted revenge, and had managed to track the Troubleshooters down. Knowing that Andy was the deadliest (with that ranged weapon, and all), Steel Hawk went after him first, and managed to grab the arm his Beam-Splitter was on. Triggering the device, Steel Hawk shot Andy's laser right through him, killing him instantly... </p>",

    "deck": "Teresa Roberts is a member of the Troubleshooters. The computer hardware expert of the bunch, Terry built a truly revolutionary computer interface with the late Dr. Swensen's technology. This partial exo-skeleton, the 'Think-Tank', is the New Universe's very first cyber-deck.",
    "description": "<p> </p><p> Like several other top scoring engineering students at M.I.T., Teresa 'Terry' Roberts managed to find herself drawn into this weird collection of people, the notorious group of high tech campus pranksters and technophiles known as the Troubleshooters. She and these techno-goons went out of their way to play odd pranks on their fellow students, making good grades all the while. </p><p>As a Troubleshooter then, Terry ended up joining the group's beloved instructor, Jenny Swensen, on a special mission one fateful night. Her father, Doctor Karl Swensen, died recently, and Jenny believed that his employer was behind the deed. Needing proof, she decided to break into his former company, Krotze International, and the Troubleshooters went along to help. </p><p> For kicks, you see. And, they felt that they had to help their beloved Jenny, their favorite teacher. </p><p>At any rate, the students discovered Doctor Swensen's Mark 2 M.A.X. suit on the premises, along with the suit's mobile laboratory. Deciding that her father was trying to hide all this from his evil employer, Fritz Krotze, Jenny booked with all the goods, taking the Troubleshooters with her, and the engineering students started breaking down the M.A.X. technology. </p><p>Over time, Terry decided that she was in love with another Troubleshooter, Eduardo Giotti, but the fool had eyes for only one woman: Jenny Swensen. Though Terry was amicable at first, helping Jenny's missions against Krotze with her new M.A.X. partial exoskeleton, Think-Tank, Terry slowly grew more and more jealous of her totally unaware rival. </p><p>This totally colored her future behavior towards her teacher, though it didn't matter much, as Jenny would soon drop out of their lives (when the Troubleshooters needed her most). You see, the Troubleshooters interrupted the planned assassination of the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, while she was visiting Boston during the Christmas holiday. </p><p>The thug who attempted to perpetrate the crime, the assassin known as Steel Hawk, found out who the Troubleshooters were, and decided to eliminate them. He killed Andy and maimed poor Timothy Ferris, but Terry and Giotti managed to ward him off. After that, the two remaining Troubleshooters (with tech) tracked him down and put the beat down on him. </p><p> Hard. </p><p>In fact, Giotti savaged poor Steel Hawk so bad, he was permanently brain damaged, and most of his bones were broken, some in multiple places. With that madman out of the picture, Terry and Giotti managed to finally get together, and pretty much forgot about poor Jenny Swensen, who'd apparently abandoned them to their fate. In the end, then, Terry got what she wanted... </p>",

His mother <a href=\"/mantis/4005-3324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3324\">Mantis</a>, the Celestial Madonna, his father a resurrected <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/swordsman/4005-3795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3795\">Swordsman </a>now empowered by a member of the Cotati is supposedly the perfect plant being. Sequoia is named after the <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a> redwood trees, considered by some to be the noblest of Earth trees. Sequoia was raised by his mother for a brief time in Connecticut in the United States of America, before he was sent to be raised with his father on <a href=\"/tamal/4020-56626/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56626\">Tamal</a>, his father an elder of the <a href=\"/cotati/4060-46135/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46135\">Cotati</a> race. In his adolescence, Sequoia went though somewhat of a rebellious and defiant phase, and it is in this period he adopted the alias Quoi and Q. His reasoning for adopting the name Q was because he believed it to be the weirdest Earth letter. The appearance of a peculiar and special star signaled that Quoi had matured, as it had also happened to have alerted Thanos to the occurrence as well prompting thim to track down Quoi. This was already known to his mother Mantis who gathered a team of <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> to rescue and protect her son. <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision,</a> <a href=\"/silverclaw/4005-11341/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11341\">Silverclaw,</a> <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor,</a> <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch,</a> <a href=\"/haywire/4005-12901/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12901\">Haywire</a> and Mantis head to Tamal to locate Quoi. </p><p> </p><p>Reuniting with his mother Mantis when the team arrives to Tamal Quoi still displays a seemingly brash and uncaring attitude. The newborn star still signaling the significance of Sequoia's destiny, several groups try to claim the the would be messiah. Including the <a href=\"/thanosi/4060-57876/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57876\">Thanosi</a>  who has now gathered two powerful underlings <a href=\"/primo/4005-83252/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83252\">Primo</a> and <a href=\"/reptyl/4005-27722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27722\">Reptyl</a> to serve under him. A space pirate <a href=\"/raptra/4005-83251/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83251\">Raptra</a> formerly associated with Thanos manages to capture the teen, with the goal of delivering him to the Thanosi, but the eventually the two befriended and developed somewhat of a romantic relationship. With time Quoi also mends and develops a close kinship with his mother. </p><p> </p><h2>Creation </h2><p>Sequoia is a Marvel comics character and was created by <a href=\"/steve-englehart/4040-42211/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42211\">Steve Englehart</a>. He first appeared in Silver Surfer #4.</p><p> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><h3>Avengers Celestial Quest</h3><p>Living on Tamal Quoi is moody, bitter and sarcastic. The arrival of several Avengers, Haywire and his mother Mantis to protect him does little to curb his attitude. His Cotati father takes on the guise of Swordsman to better communicate with his child's mother and the Avengers, informing them of Quoi's developing attitude and differences from the pure Cotati. Despite Mantis attempts to bond with her son, Quoi continues to reject her, and he lashes out at her, eventually revealing the source of his resentment as being abandoned and having to live among the Cotati who are unlike him and so very placid and orderly. Mantis persists even noting Quoi's improved speech since the group had arrived,and eventually starts getting her son to open up to her. This mother son bonding is interrupted when space pirate Raptra kidnaps Quoi hoping to use him to trade for her own freedom from Thanos. The Avengers are attacked by the Cotati who blame them, with Quoi's father expunged from the Cotati for defending the Avenger's presence. The Avengers manage to defend themselves before heading into space to track Quoi. Despite the situation, Quoi finds himself attracted to Raptra and her pirate lifestyle. She assures him that she is actually trying to help him. The two exchange banter amidst conversation and a quick friendly scuffle, before flirting, before an unexpected kiss. Not long after the two are attacked by Thanos created gods Primo god of fire and Reptyl, god of the pirates, with Raptra managing to user a power laser gun to hold off Reptyl as Quoi manages to defeat Primo, extinguishing his flame. Reptly manages to use his newly enhanced speed and strength to knock down Quoi just as Thanos appears and apprehends Raptra. Thanos taunts Quo, explaining that he also is in possession of Mantis. </p><h3>The Rot</h3><p>Thanos has imprisoned Quoi, alongside his new companion Raptra, the Vision, and Mantis. The Avengers are on their way to rescue the group, as Mantis and Quoi both manage to engage Thanos in battle. As the Avengers arrive Thanos attempts to teleport away only to realize he can't for a massive sickly entity the Rot has appeared and surrounded his and the Avengers ship. Thanos realizes he must work with Quoi and the Avengers if any of them should wish to survive and the groups concentrated efforts is enough to beat the ravenous Rot creature. Quoi still enamored with Raptra and her free and easy lifestyle decides to stay with her and the two plan to help the surrounding space areas inhabitants affected by the Rot. Quoi also finds peace accepting his mother the two bonding. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities </h2><p>Sequoia is a Half-human, half-cotati hybrid, with plant like features and characteristics. He has an enhanced physical physiology, and does not require food or oxygen. He possesses super strength, and the ability to manipulate oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as a limited amount of power cosmic, which may increase as he matures. Sequoia can absorb power, and although the extent is unknown, he has used this ability against such powerful a foe as the Mad Titan <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a></p><p>. He also has great psychic powers. The extent of Sequoia's fully developed powers remain to be seen. During the course of his interactions with English speakers, Quoi's own speech skills greatly increased from a form of broken english to standard english, the character explaining this as a facet of his absorption power. </p><h2>Alternate Earths</h2><h3>Earth-9511 (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-last-avengers-story/4050-19572/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19572\">The Last Avengers Story</a>)</h3><p>Sequoia is a member of America's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> alongside <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/gestalt/4005-47383/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47383\">Gestalt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/high-tide/4005-95471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-95471\">High Tide</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-ego/4005-95477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-95477\">Super-Ego</a>. He and his team-mates are killed in a bombing by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> to draw the attention of the real Avengers.</p><h3>Earth-900651</h3><p>In this reality Sequoia is known as Sprout. He is much younger here, and jovial. He was very interested in American football. Sprout had been targeted by numerous sources, the <a href=\"/kree-empire/4060-7588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\">Kree</a> and <a href=\"/mangog/4005-12345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12345\">Mangog</a> but his mother Mantis often has saved his life and he had also been rescued by the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer.</a></p><p>His powers are much similar to his mainstream reality version, save for the fact he is younger and chooses to adopt a more human looking appearance. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origins</h2><p>Jarael, born as Edessa, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57364\" href=\"/arkanian/4060-57364/\" slug=\"arkanian\">Arkanian</a> language meaning \"Triumph\", was born from a male and female Arkanian offshoot research couple. She was the first of a group of children created from the DNA of Jedi master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-72450\" href=\"/arca-jeth/4005-72450/\" slug=\"arca-jeth\">Arca Jeth</a> thanks to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56697\" href=\"/zeltrons/4060-56697/\" slug=\"zeltrons\">Zeltron</a> scientist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51296\" href=\"/demagol/4005-51296/\" slug=\"demagol\">Antos Wyrick</a>, who was trying to create a race of Mandalorian warriors with Force capabilities. With the success of Edessa, more children were created. Wyrick turned his research facility into an academy for the children that developed their skills. During her time as a student, Edessa developed a strong student and teacher relationship with her teacher Wyrick and became his top student. However, Wyrick was doing business with a slave organization called the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57583\" href=\"/the-crucible/4060-57583/\" slug=\"the-crucible\">Crucible</a> that looked for slaves. The Crucible attacked the academy while Wyrick was away led by Dace Golliard. Golliard burned the academy down and took the settlers as slaves. Edessa, was forced to run away. She was then discovered by Golliard who decided to go with him and became a slave of the Crucible.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823925-edessa_and_golliard.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823925\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.73416666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823925-edessa_and_golliard.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823925\"><img alt=\"Meeting Dace Golliard\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823925-edessa_and_golliard.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823925-edessa_and_golliard.jpg 1200w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823925-edessa_and_golliard.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823925-edessa_and_golliard.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Meeting Dace Golliard</figcaption></figure><p>While in the Crucible, Edessa was forced to fight against other slaves like her as part of training. She later became a subordinate to a Zelton woman named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14737\" href=\"/chantique/4005-14737/\" slug=\"chantique\">Chantique</a>. Sometime later, Edessa challenged Chantique for control and won, becoming the new trainer and slaver. As the new trainer, she made life a little bit easier for new slaves under her watch, which in turn called her, \"Jarael\" which meant, \"Protector\" in Crucible language and no longer went by her birth name. At some time, Jarael received the mark of the Crucible, a tattoo on her face which showed she was part of the Crucible.</p><p>At some point in time, Jarael met an older Arkanian called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46143\" href=\"/camper/4005-46143/\" slug=\"camper\">Camper</a>, who help her escape the Crucible. Jarael decided to travel and protect him as an attempt to return the favor. Eventually, the pair made their way to the planet <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55691\" href=\"/taris/4020-55691/\" slug=\"taris\">Taris</a>, where they hid in the Lower City distant known as Junk Junction and lived in an abandon space ship known as the Last Resort.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Jarael was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-44853\" href=\"/john-jackson-miller/4040-44853/\" slug=\"john-jackson-miller\">John Jackson Miller</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-47110\" href=\"/brian-ching/4040-47110/\" slug=\"brian-ching\">Brian Ching</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Due to being part of the Crucible when she was young, Jarael was known to be very hostile and defensive towards people she didn't know except for Camper, the one who rescued her. This was shown when she first came across Zayne Carrick. However, as she traveled with Carrick, she was known to be caring towards others. She helped cleared Zayne's name when he was on the run, and Carrick helped her deal with her past. At the end, she had fallen in love with Zayne, and the two began a romantic relationship.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Commencement</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1640260-jarael.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1640260\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.14875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1640260-jarael.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1640260\"><img alt=\"Meeting Zayne for the first time\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/1640260-jarael.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/1640260-jarael.jpg 800w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/1640260-jarael.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Meeting Zayne for the first time</figcaption></figure><p>Following the Padawan Massacre of Taris, <a href=\"../../zayne/29-50884/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zayne Carrick</a> and <a href=\"../../gryph/29-50883/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marn Hierogryph</a> sought the aid of Camper, but was attacked by Jarael who bested Zayne in a fight using an electrostaff. Jarael ordered them leave immediately, and not to return for she had no interest in helping the fugitive. Annoyed by Jarael's demeanor, Carrick called her \"Darth Sunshine\". An arrest party arrived at Junk Junction, and she and Camper was forced to help Carrick and Hierogryph flee using the Last Resort to escape.</p><p>The group then hid nearby asteroid field. While Camper had a dizzy spell and Jarael went to help him, Zayne attempted to fly out of the asteroid field to make a holographic transmission to Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48395\" href=\"/vandar-tokare/4005-48395/\" slug=\"vandar-tokare\">Vandar Tokare</a> on the planet Dantooine to explain what happened. However Jarael arrived in time and knocked Zayne unconscious and flew the Last Resort back into the asteroid field. As Zayne gain consciousness, he realized that they were directly on top of the Rogue moon the site of the former Padawans' last training exercise. Jarael accompanied him to the surface of the moon, where they discovered the damaged <a href=\"../../t1-lb/29-50908/\" rel=\"nofollow\">T1-LB</a>, the Jedi's bulk-loader droid. As they found the droid, Jedi Master Lucien Draay discovered them. Thanks to the Last Resort's repaired weapon systems, it allowed Jarael and Zayne to escape with the damaged droid.</p><p>Thanks to repairs made by Camper, Carrick and Jarael found a recording that revealed that the Jedi Masters had received a vision of a Sith Lord in red armor, killing Jedi and destroying cities across the galaxy. The recording was cut off when it was revealed that T1-LB (or \"Elbee\" which Zayne started to call him) was Force pushed off the cliff side by Lucien Draay. Soon after the revelation the Last Resort was attacked by the bounty hunter vessel Oroko and trapped by its tractor beam. Onboard the Oroko, they were detained by the bounty hunter Valius Ying. Due to Gryph's scheming, everyone but Zayne were allowed to go free since his bounty was the highest. Zayne pretended to leave with the bounty hunter, but was able to sneak on the Last Resort where Jarael was waiting. She told him to stop running away, and that, by giving himself up, he would save the lives of his friends. Zayne knew she was right, and tossed his lightsaber to a surprised Jarael, and decided to give himself up to the Jedi Masters.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-420930\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6356073211314\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:163.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-420930\"><img alt=\"Saving Zayne\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg 601w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Saving Zayne\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg 601w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15455/420930-Jarealrescueszayne.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Saving Zayne</figcaption></figure><p>Touched by Zayne's sacrifice, Jarael decided to rescue him.

In order to do that, they needed credits. Marn Hierogryph came up with a quick scheme to gain access to his bank account on the banking world of Telerath. Camper and Jarael disguised themselves as, \"Baron Hyro Margryph\" and \"Chantique\" and explained to the bank that somehow made a mistake and froze their account. The account was reopened, but while looking out on the balcony with the banker, the Moomo Brothers, second rate bounty hunters consisting of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51441\" href=\"/dob-moomo/4005-51441/\" slug=\"dob-moomo\">Dob</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50947\" href=\"/del-moomo/4005-50947/\" slug=\"del-moomo\">Del</a>, appeared and took the banker. The banker, as it turned out, was none other than Arvan Carrick, Zayne Carrick's father. Camper, Zayne, and Gryph developed a plan which allowed them to rescue Zayne's father while Jarael wanted nothing to do with it due to what happen on Vanquo when she disguised herself as a Jedi. Instead, Camper took her place disguising himself as a Jedi. Gryph convinced Dob, one of the Moomo brothers, that Zayne was on the planet and was willing to trade his life for his father. As they met at the designated spot, Gryph was with Camper who was in disguise. Zayne secretly made his way in the Moomo Brothers' ship and rescued his father. Once his father was rescued, he help transfer the money needed by both Gryph and Zayne.</p><h3>Days of Fear, Nights of Anger</h3><p>After the rescue of Zayne's father Arvan, Jarael, thanked Zayne for all his help, and hoped he could clear his name. She, Camper, and T1-LB left on the Last Resort.

Camper was injured in the attack leaving Jarael to face the droid alone, when Rohlan came from behind and disable the droid. He revealed that he was hiding in the ship's smuggling compartments after the events at Flashpoint. As Jarael tended to Camper, she notice that Camper's injuries cause him to have a serious \"spell\" not like the other in the past that cause him to go into a coma-like state.

While in the hanger, Elbee displayed a holographic transmission to Jarael from Camper stating that he was going to take the Last Resort and jump into hyperspace to lead the exogorths away. Jarael tearfully said her good-bye to Camper as he jumped into hyperspace. While still on the damaged Arkanian Legacy, Lucien arrived and offered Zayne a ultimatum to turned himself in, and he would allow his friends to live. With no choice, Zayne agreed, but then the Moorno Williwaw crashed into the hanger. Appearing from the ship was the Moomo Brothers and the Trandoshan, called Slyssk who then revealed to Zayne that Marn Hierogryph was still alive on Taris and ask him to look for Zayne. As Zayne and his friends boarded and made their escape, Zayne asked Jarael for help in facing his masters. Jarael did not give him an answer right away after losing one of her closest friends.</p><h3>Knight of Suffering</h3><p>A few days later, Zayne went to look for Marn Hierogryph on Taris. Because of losing Camper, Jarael felt depressed for sometime and without a sense of purpose. Rohlan took notice and told her that she spare with Alek to feel better. In the cargo hold, Jarael spared with Alek and won. Afterward, Alex confessed to Jarael that he would like to pursue a romantic relationship with her, despite the Jedi code. Jarael, surprised by this asked that she be given time before she could give him an answer, but Alek was unconvinced, and told her to ask herself whether it was really just the timing or because it was just him she didn't want to be with.</p><h3>Vector</h3><p>While on Taris, Zayne managed to call Jarael for assistant as he requested her, Alek and Rohlan to take two children, the children of Constable Sowrs to their father on Alderaan along with his friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50949\" href=\"/shel-jelavan/4005-50949/\" slug=\"shel-jelavan\">Shel Jelavan</a> while he stayed on Taris. A couple of days later, while on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-45973\" href=\"/alderaan/4020-45973/\" slug=\"alderaan\">Alderaan</a>, Jarael received another message from Zayne to come to the ice planet Jebble for pickup. On arrival, they found the planet swarmed with Rakghoul-turned Mandalorians. Though rescued, Zayne ordered the Williwaw to turn around to pick up a friend of his, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50886\" href=\"/celeste-morne/4005-50886/\" slug=\"celeste-morne\">Celeste Morne</a> who was put into a oubliette. Before they were able to, Cassus Fett had arrived and fired off nuclear warheads, effectively wiping out the entire Mandalorian force and apparently killing Celeste. Jarael, Alek and Shel reassured Zayne that they could count on them to help him clear his name. Zayne started his plan of clearing his name by first heading to the planet Odryn using the key Celeste gave him to find the Sith artifacts the Jedi Covenant had.</p><h3>Validation</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823907\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.92216582064298\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823907\"><img alt=\"Disguised as Celeste Morne\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg 1182w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Disguised as Celeste Morne\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg 1182w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823907-jarael_disgused_as_celeste.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Disguised as Celeste Morne</figcaption></figure><p>At Odryn, Jarael disguised herself as Celeste Morne in order for her, Zayne and Marn to sneak in the Sanctum of the Exalted on Odryn that was guarded by the native Feeorins and their leader, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-69997\" href=\"/borjak/4005-69997/\" slug=\"borjak\">Borjak</a>. After defeating Borjak, Jarael convince Borjak to take her to the Sanctum of the Exalted in order to place the Muur Talisman in the collection of Sith artifacts. Borjak showed her the temple and explained how only Jedi Covenant member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50907\" href=\"/feln/4005-50907/\" slug=\"feln\">Feln</a>, may enter along with any guest. After Borjak left, Zayne and Gryph immediately started to record all the artifacts the Covenant has been storing. Jarael and the Moomo Brothers left for the rendezvous point and after Zayne and Gryph had a confrontation with Feln which left to his death, the group headed for Coruscant to prove Zayne's innocence to Jedi masters Vandar Tokare and Vrook Lamar.</p><p>When Coruscant was protected by Admiral Saul Karath commanding the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56127\" href=\"/swiftsure/4055-56127/\" slug=\"swiftsure\">Swiftsure</a>, Jarael decided to allow Zayne, Gryph, Slyssk and the stolen artifacts from Odryn to escape while she, Rohlan, and the Moomo Brothers allowed themselves to be captured though Zayne was hesitant to allow Jarael to do this for him. Jarael took the Williwaw and crash landed it in the hangar of the Swifisure. While Admiral Karath detained Jarael and the group, Zayne, Gryph and Slyssk managed to sneak on the planet.</p><p>After Zayne and Gryph were cleared of the murders, Jarael thought about going to fight the Mandalorians with Zayne safe, but decided that Rohlan needed her help to find the answers in his own quest. During Saul Karath's speech, Gryph gave Jarael Zayne's Padawan braid, wanting him to give it to her. Unknown to her, Zayne turned down the offer of being promoted to a Jedi Knight and opted to partner up with Gryph while protecting the little people who slip beyond the Jedi and Republic notice.</p><h3>Prophet Motive</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823913\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2461908580593\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823913\"><img alt=\"As Captain Brackel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg 1247w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"As Captain Brackel\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg 1247w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823913-disgused_as_a_captain.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>As Captain Brackel</figcaption></figure><p>One month after Zayne cleared his name, Zayne took some time off to visit his family. Meanwhile, Gryph created a new scam with Jarael and Rohlan Dyre. On <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56413\" href=\"/metellos-3/4020-56413/\" slug=\"metellos-3\">Metellos 3</a>, planetary exchanges were being made for money. Jarael disguised herself as Captain Brackel, captain and owner of Gryph's new ship , the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56128\" href=\"/hot-prospect/4055-56128/\" slug=\"hot-prospect\">Hot Prospect</a>, and Rohlan, disguised himself as a disgruntled native speaking an unknown language, and stormed the area and holding up the Chev Cipiter. As Jarael explained how the natives of the planet Italbos were disgruntled with their planet being claimed and sold off by the auctioneers, Gryph, disguised as Gryphomarn, a professor of law, volunteered to represent the natives of Italbos in a new auction where the natives would get paid a large sum of money for their supposed mineral-riched planet.</p><p>The plan didn't go exactly as planned, and the trio were ambushed by a task force of Sentinel droids. Rohlan and Jarael managed to hold off the task force while Gryph managed to sneak away, but Rohlan and Jarael were captured in the end. Restrained with energy leashes, the two met Cipter's master, the Chevin, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64408\" href=\"/nunk-plaarvin/4005-64408/\" slug=\"nunk-plaarvin\">Nunk Plaarvin</a> of the Raff Syndicate. Nunk had both Jarael and Rohlan strung up in an observation tower that glass was meant to magnify and incinerate anyone in the room. Left to their fates by Nunk, Jarael and Rohlan watched as the sun began to shine on the edge of the observatory's lens. As the heat built up, Rohlan revealed his suspicion to Jarael that she might be Force sensitive. He encouraged her to reach out with the Force and break the chains that bound them. Despite an initial protest that she did not have the power, Jarael did her best to call upon the Force to break the chain. After breaking the chains, she later, met up with Zayne, with Zayne telling her how he save Gryph and help with the plan. After finishing up the plan on Metellos 3 Rohlan told Zayne about Jarael's Force powers and that he would need to instruct Jarael in the ways of the Force.</p><h3>Faithful Execution</h3><p>After Metellos 3, Gryph went off to the planet Pantolomin to set up their next scam. Meanwhile, Jarael and the Hot Prospect came across a lost luxury vessel, the Chancellor Fillorean. While exploring in the ship, the crew discovered that all the passengers were dead, except a Bimm named Toki Tollivar and his droid, Kayo. Toki informed Zayne and Slyssk that pirates had attacked the ship while he hid. While Zayne left to call a Republic vessel, Jarael came across a strangled Slyssk in the galley. While Zayne was trying to use the Force to clear Slyssk's throat unsuccessfully, Jarael begged Rohlan to save him. The Mandalorian surgically implanted a breathing tube into Slyssk's throat saving him.</p><p>Zayne noticed Toki had been witness to the surgery. Toki claimed that he had been in his cabin to rest and sent Kayo to get his food. Zayne and Demagol rushed off to apprehend the droid servant while Jarael remained to guard Toki and Slyssk. However, while Kayo was believed to be responsible for the murders and the attempted murder of Slyssk, Toki Tolivar was the real strangler or better known in Republic space as the Corellian Strangler. Toki revealed himself as a Sith as he put Jarael into a Force Grip. Before he could crush Jarael's windpipe, Zayne shot Toki. The blast however only wounded him and he attacked him. Toki overwhelmed Zayne but the timely arrival of Kayo saved him. Kayo grabbed Toki and electrocuted him while Toki screamed. Rohlan then shot Kayo in the back, resulting in an explosion that killed Trolivar. After Zayne argued that Rohlan didn't have to kill them, but Rohlan retorted that he was no use to him if he could not protect Jarael.</p><h3>Dueling Ambitions</h3><p>Upon arriving on Jervo's World, a large network of swoop-dueling arenas above Pantolomin owned by Lhosan Industries, Gryph had a scheme that involved using a small delay in the feed from the secondary dueling arenas to place bets on the winners before the result of the race was revealed to the audience. However, Zayne had entered the dueling games himself to win a replica swoop bike of his hero, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74547\" href=\"/goethar-kleej/4005-74547/\" slug=\"goethar-kleej\">Goethar Kleej</a> while Jareal found herself unable to place the bets due to her being uncomfortable making wagers on brawls.</p><p>Later, while resting aboard Hot Prospect, Jarael experienced a Force Vision. In this vision she was back on Taris in the Jedi Tower, at the time when she rescued Zayne, but instead of Zayne's Masters, she saw the men who played significant role in her life over the past few months: Malak, Rohlan, Demagol and Arkoh Adasca. The four men who expressed interest in Jarael in reality, told her that the reason for that was hidden within herself, pointing to her clouded past and mysterious destiny. Behind her Zayne appeared, bound in chains and blaming Jarael for betraying him. A mysterious woman who held Carrick's chains told Jarael that he now belonged to her and left her at the mercy of the four men. At that moment Jarael woke up and unwillingly overheard Zayne Carrick speaking to, what appeared to be, Elbee. Realizing that Zayne was concerned about Goethar Kleej, Jarael showed him the non-edited version of his retirement speech which Hierogryph had lifted from the broadcast center and decided to help Zayne.</p><p>Jarael disguised herself as a blue skinned species and flirted with the composer for the games. She managed to switch his data cube containing musical scores for the duels with one that had the full version of Goethar's speech as well as a statement by Jervo Thalien concerning the illegal funding for the races. Afterward, Zayne offered his help to help Jarael with her Force abilities, Goethar came to thank him for saving his son, but when he saw Jarael's tattoos, he recognized her tattoos as being the Flames of the Crucible worn by members of the same organization that provided the slaves for the duels. Goethar told her to stay away from him and his son, and stormed off with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74546\" href=\"/aubin-kleej/4005-74546/\" slug=\"aubin-kleej\">Aubin</a> telling Zayne that that a person like him should never be around someone like Jarael. Distressed, Jarael fled from the scene to her quarters aboard the Hot Prospect while Zayne went after her to ask what Goethar had meant. Jarael confessed that she was once a slaver herself before meeting Camper.</p><h3>Masks</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263104\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.531393568147\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263104\"><img alt=\"Zayne kissing Jarael\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg 653w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Zayne kissing Jarael\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg 653w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67173/1263104-zaynekissesjarael.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zayne kissing Jarael</figcaption></figure><p>On the planet <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56414\" href=\"/wor-tandell/4020-56414/\" slug=\"wor-tandell\">Wor Tandell</a> where Zayne was going to meet up with representatives from the Republic. Jarael took to riding a tandreed in the forests in the area. During the ride, the creature stumbled and fell, throwing her off, though she was kept afloat by Zayne who was passing through. Jarael finally opened up and revealed how she ended up with the Crucible and how she attempted to help the slaves. While Zayne asked to help her in bringing the organization down, Jarael angrily returned to the Hot Prospect demanding that he simply help her run from it as she helped him during his run from the Jedi Covenant saying that the Crucible was too large to take down.</p><p>Instead of finding Slyssk waiting for her at the ship, she was greeted by Malak who had come to officially recruit her into the joining him against the Mandalorians. Malak had also confessed that he has fallen in love with her. Gryph accidently mentioned her recently discovered Force talents which overjoyed Malak though Jarael was still reluctant to go with him. While Malak continued to try and convince her, Rohlan was enraged of the idea and the fact that Malak was attempting to take her away. A brawl between the two began, and ended when Captain Telettoh and Zayne arrived. Malak explained how he simply wanted Jarael to join him claiming that the Jedi would welcome her. Zayne could see that this was not what Jarael wanted and, in an attempt to get Malak to leave, Zayne kissed Jarael and claimed that they were in love and were going far away from the war. The ruse was successful and Malak, rejected again by Jarael, left along with Ferroh and Telettoh. Zayne later promised to Jarael to use the resources, which he acquired during his vacation and that he had kept a secret from Gryph, to destory the Crucible.</p><h3>Destroyer</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823896-thereapingpart1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823896\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4733333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823896-thereapingpart1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823896\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823896-thereapingpart1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823896-thereapingpart1.jpg 900w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823896-thereapingpart1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823896-thereapingpart1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823896-thereapingpart1.jpg 900w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823896-thereapingpart1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Using Zayne's sources, he and Jarael were able to discover that the Crucible was still operating with the Sungrazer Cooperative on comets in the Koornacht Cluster. Hoping to ruin the Crucibles relationship with the Cooperative and free the slaves forced to mine thorlide, the two disguised themselves as Crucible officers. Jarael and Zayne forced the Koorivar officer in charge, Sariyah Budan into handing over a portion of the Cooperatives crystal harvest or else she'd be collecting the crystals herself. Budan obliged and granted the two stay in a cabin while they wait for the harvest to be transferred over to the Hot Prospect. While Zayne went to go find the slaves, Jarael went to find a shuttle to transport the slaves out. Budan soon discovered that the two of them were not sent and ordered them to be detain. With their escape ruined, Jarael and Zayne were forced into environmental suits and onto the surface of a comet, pursued by security forces while enduring on a slowly breaking comet.</p><p>After making it to the Hot Prospect, Zayne opened all the airlocks on the vessel and he used the Force to transport all eighty slaves on the comet inside, much to the chagrin of Gryph who was unaware of Jarael's past involvement in the Crucible and unaware of the scheme Jarael and Zayne was doing. During the rescue however, the Crucible vessel called the Gladiator arrived under the command of Fleet Captain Dace Golliard who had dispatched Skyreaper drones. Jarael was taken by a drone but quickly rescued by Zayne and Rohlan who hauled them back into the Hot Prospect. The Gladiator began to fire on the Hot Prospect, preventing it from turning it's thrusters and allowing Jarael to blast it with the cannons on the Hot Prospect that were on the other side. However, Zayne came up with an idea using the Hot Prospect's array of drills and hooks and cables to create considerable damage to the Gladiator and then eventually, by jamming one of the ships main components, which the <i>Prospect</i> to spin wildly and allow Jarael to fire upon the Gladiator and escape into hyperspace.</p><p>At a transit hub near the Koornacht Cluster, the released slaves were unloaded and taken to a refugee center. Jarael finally came clean with Rohlan and Gryph regarding her past as a slaver and made a resolution to stop the Crucible. While Rohlan did not hesitate in agreeing to assist her in anyway, Gryph was reluctant in crossing the Crucible though agreed when Zayne informed him he was going to work his next con alone. Zayne decided to disguise himself as a Republic navy officer, by the name of \"Carth Kamlin\" and infiltrate the Crucible on the planet Volgax. However, Chantique discovered his true identity as Zayne Carrick and revealed Jarael's birth name and the meaning of \"Jarael\" as \"destroyer\".</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823941-the_truth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823941\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2565180824222\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823941-the_truth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823941\"><img alt=\"Jarael means \"Protector\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823941-the_truth.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823941-the_truth.jpg 1189w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823941-the_truth.jpg 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823941-the_truth.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jarael means \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jarael means \"Protector\"</figcaption></figure><p>With Zayne's tracker discovered, the crew of the Hot Prospect had no means of locating Zayne. Jarael became desperate for help finding Zayne even asking Malak for assistance. Despite this, Malak could not help due to his cause to the Revanchists. Remembering Zayne talking to Elbee about his contracts, Jarael pleaded with the droid in help finding him. Elbee established a connection to his contacts who turned out to be Shel Jelavan on Coruscant. With Shel's help, Jarael and the crew were able to locate Zayne on Volgax, stranded in the pouring rain. However, Jarael found Zayne disgusted with her and miserable from his experience with the Crucible where Chantique made him witness to the torture by melding minds with a Caamasi slave known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75413\" href=\"/ralthar-sitan/4005-75413/\" slug=\"ralthar-sitan\">Ralthar Sitan</a> and then informing him of Jarael's actions in the organization when she was a teenager. Jarael attempted to defend herself by explaining that she was merely trying to help the slaves, but Zayne rejected the idea in favor that she could have done more for them instead of simply running away from the Crucible and then keeping her name which he still believed to mean, \"destroyer\". Jarael, sadden by Zayne's attitude toward her, declared that it was time for the two to part ways. Before she left with Rohlan, she informed Zayne of the true meaning of her name, that Jarael meant, \"protector\" instead of, \"destroyer\". Before Zayne realized he was deceived by Chantique, Jarael already left.</p><h3>Demon</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1263096-jarael_kun_s_lightsaber.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263096\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0380165289256\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:103.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1263096-jarael_kun_s_lightsaber.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263096\"><img alt=\"Wielding Exar Kun's lightsaber\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1263096-jarael_kun_s_lightsaber.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1263096-jarael_kun_s_lightsaber.jpg 1210w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1263096-jarael_kun_s_lightsaber.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wielding Exar Kun's lightsaber\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1263096-jarael_kun_s_lightsaber.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1263096-jarael_kun_s_lightsaber.jpg 1210w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1263096-jarael_kun_s_lightsaber.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wielding Exar Kun's lightsaber</figcaption></figure><p>While traveling with Rohlan to Wor Tandell, she lamented that there appeared to be no way that they could bring down the Crucible. However, Rohlan told Jarael that he had learned the Crucible had a power base on the planet Osadia. He also believed that Jarael's kidnapped schoolmates were being held captive on Osadia. Rohlan plotted a course for the planet, then revealed his true identity as Antos Wyrick. Jarael was happy to learn that her old master was alive and well. Wyrick informed Jarael what happened to him after the school fell. However, Wyrick kept the Rohlan Dyre persona claiming to have taken the name Rohlan Dyre when joining the Mandalorian Wars and constantly running away to find her.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823937\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.59375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823937\"><img alt=\"About to kill Chantique\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" data-width=\"602\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg 1280w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg 1204w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg 602w\"><noscript><img alt=\"About to kill Chantique\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg 1280w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg 1204w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823937-jarael_and_chantique.jpg 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" data-width=\"602\"></noscript></a><figcaption>About to kill Chantique</figcaption></figure><p>Arriving at Osadia, Antos express to Jarael his wish to be the students' salvation and for her to be his redemption. They found the school guarded by security forces led by Bar'injar. Wyrick gave Jarael a weapon stolen from the cache of weapons brought from the Jedi Covenant's artifact storehouse on Odryn: the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48780\" href=\"/exar-kun/4005-48780/\" slug=\"exar-kun\">Sith Lord Exar Kun's</a> double lightsaber. Jarael used the weapon to wound the guards while Antos killed Bar'injar. Wyrick then told Jarael to search the training hall, while he looked for the students in another area. As Jarael investigated, she heard a familiar voice taunting her, that of Chantique, whom Jarael had presumed was dead. The Zeltron used the Force to send spears flying toward Jarael, who easily cut through them with her lightsaber. Chantique taunted Jarael on her successful attempt to turn Zayne against Jarael, implying that she would attempt to get him back to the dueling pits. This provoked Jarael into charging at Chantique and overcame her. As she stood above her, ready to strike her down, Zayne Carrick fell through the ceiling and crash landed on top of Jarael. The distraction gave Chantique an opportunity to seize the double-bladed saber and engage Zayne in a duel with her own Force powers being amplified by the dark power of the saber itself. Chantique saw into Zayne's mind and discovered her father, Wyrick, was also at the academy. Chantique fled from the battle to search for her father, allowing Zayne and Jarael to escape. while escaping, Zayne explained that he realized that Jarael was telling the truth about her name and that the real Rohlan Dyre was drugged and took the place of Demagol who was Wyrick all along. Jarael also confessed to not feeling anything odd or cold when she was wielding Exar Kun's lightsaber. Chantique soon returned, using the Force to throw Jarael and Zayne around the room, and took Zayne's lightsaber and declared that she no longer needed the Crucible. However, her father stabbed her in the back with a dagger. Wounded, Chantique told him that the children were in the back. However, when he looked around he soon realized that she buried them alive.</p><p>Despite the loss, Antos stilled believed he still had hope for his Mandalorian Knights plan with Jarael. Zayne however revealed that, due to Jarael's inability to feel the dark side from Kun's lightsaber, that she was only minimally Force sensitive and that he and his daughter, whom he believed was no use to him, was the one strong in the Force though he didn't even realize it till now and the events back on Metellos 3 was his doing instead of Jarael. Suddenly, Chantique lashed out at her father with the dagger he put in her back. Antos to use the Force to grab both of lightsabers: Kun's double-bladed saber and Zayne's lightsaber, but due to Zayne's presence, he accidentally grabbed Kun's saber and activated both ends at the blade going through both him and his daughter, killing them both.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823942\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66603415559772\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1823942\"><img alt=\"Finally together\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg 1054w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Finally together\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg 1054w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67173/1823942-jareal_and_zayne.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Finally together</figcaption></figure><p>Afteward with the help of the Rohlan Dyre, Zayne managed to track down Jarael's parents and arranged a meeting between the three as an anniversary gift for their meeting.

She suggested that Zayne wasn't like the other Jedi: to be free of emotional connections and physical contact to which Zayne agreed he wasn't.

    "description": "<p>The Vision of Escaflowne (Anime)</p><p>=======</p><p>Van is the son of the king of Fanelia, a small country in Gaea, and a Draconian, a being from Atlantis. As a child Van was trained by Balgus, one of the four master swordsman in Gaea, in the art of sword fighting and mortal combat. As a child Van was friends with a catgirl named Merle. Once when she didn't believe that he had wings, an attribute of Draconians, Van tried to prove it to her by jumping off a building. The wings appeared but he lost control and started to fall only to be caught by his mother. She warned him never to show his wings until the appropriate moment. </p><p>Years later while Van was slaying a dragon to become king, he was transported to Earth where he met a girl named Hitmoi. Van managed to slay the beast with the girls help, but when he returned she accidentally came with him back to Gaea. They returned to the kingdom of Gaea where Van revealed the heart of the dragon he had slayed. He was later named king by the people; however, during his induction ceremony an attack was launched of Fanelia by invisible enemies.</p>",

Five people, however, agree to help, including the stranger. Vida Rocca is one of those five. Vida is sister to Maddie, the blue ranger. Udonna reveals herself to the soon-to-be rangers, telling them they are the ones chosen to be Power Rangers Mystic Force. They don't believe her and continue to find a way out of the forest.

Vida says she believes and demonstrates her control of Wind, spinning her body around into a massive Cyclone. Instead of having machines as Zords, The Mystic Force Rangers have Mystic Titan forms, in which they actually transform into their zords.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Eight year old Hannah Washington, a lonely young girl continually tormented and bullied at school and her father a suspect in an armed robbery and taken into custody, she uses her imagination to escape the harsh realities of her life. She does this by writing in her diary stories of an alter-ego; an adult version of herself who is a superhero known as Ant. Hannah appears to know more about the world than she should and often has the personality of an emotionally unstable young adult, and her new principal takes interest in her as a result. She ends up dropping her diary, and it is read and returned by her friend Stephen, who appears as \"Gadget Man\" in Ant's Cockroach battle, the events of which we follow whenever Hannah's diary is read or has an entry.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Ant was created by <a href=\"/mario-gully/4040-48392/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-48392\">Mario Gully</a>.</p><blockquote><p>\"I invented \"ANT\" in 1996 when I was convicted of armed robbery. One day while I was looking out the bared window and an tiny ant crawled in from the outside. At that moment, I wanted to trade my life for the tiny insect. I wanted to live outside of myself. The remorse of the crime I did was unbearable. That tiny ant was my inspiration to live my dreams and to do what most around me said I couldn't do---be a comic book creator.\"</p></blockquote><h2>Vol. 1</h2><p>Hannah's father was released from custody but eventually, his home gets raided as they apparently have the evidence they need to put him away. Hannah is found foaming at the mouth, having a seizure on the floor. The son of the man he killed pushes for the death penalty - which would normally be a severe punishment, but thanks to his influence, his demands are met and Hannah's father is sentenced to death. We find Hannah's mother, Betty, who had left many years ago make an unwelcome step back into Hannah's life. However, after reading Hannah's diary she comes to the conclusion that it was a mistake to leave. Meanwhile, Ant is beaten by the Cockroach and loses her exoskeleton. Stephen later gives her a can which recharges her blood sugar and her exoskeleton grows back. She then defeats the Cockroach. Hannah finally manages to obtain information using Ant to clear her fathers name - when told this is impossible event as she said Ant was who she would be in the future, she blacks out, outbursts and eventually ends up in a straitjacket. She manages to escape, leaving behind one of the cans she used to regenerate her exoskeleton in her story, leading on to the second volume.</p><h2>Vol. 2</h2><p>An adult Hannah Washington wakes up in a mental institution, where she's been told all her memories are the result of a coping mechanism described as a \"juvenile power fantasy.\" But, little by little, her fantasies of her life as Ant become more and more real.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Ant possesses the typical enhanced speed and strength of many bug-based superheroes, but in addition she has antennae which provide her with super-human level senses. Also used as prehensile bladed tendrils useful for deflecting bullets and perforating flesh, concrete or steel. One of the more interesting aspects of the character is her exo-skeleton, which appears to be regenerated by use of her blood-sugar. When her armor wears down, it breaks off rather quickly and she must recharge her blood-sugar in order to regenerate it. She seems to use some kind of spray-can with an ant symbol to do this.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Brian was a fan of superheros. One day his mother was mugged and the person was never caught. Brian hoped that a superhero would find the scum who mugged his mother. He wrote many letters to all these heroes but none answered. He was later visited by the <a href=\"/dark-dwarf/4005-14713/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14713\"> Dwarf</a> who gave him a page of the <a href=\"/the-darkhold/4055-45058/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-45058\"> Darkhold</a>. This would give him the power of his favorite hero <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Spider-Man</a>. But it turned him into a spider-like monster who wore Spider-Man's costume and dubbed himself Spider-X. This would make other heros think that Spider-X was the actual Spider-Man.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Spider-X was creatred by Mort Todd and first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/midnight-sons-unlimited-3-sins-of-spider-x/4000-66511/\">Midnight Sons Unlimited issue 3 </a>(1993).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Midnight Sons</h3><p><a href=\"/ghost-rider/4005-4268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4268\"> Ghost Rider</a> and <a href=\"/johnny-blaze/4005-6108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6108\"> Blaze</a> were the first to see Spider-X when they accicdently rode right into Spider-X's webs swarming with the bodies of dead criminals. The two spirits of vengence barely escaped with there lives. Later on Spider-X found the criminal that mugged his mother and killed him, wrapping his corpse is his deadly webbing. He stashed the body in his mother's house, attracting the attention of the <a href=\"/nightstalkers/4060-40523/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40523\"> Nightstalkers</a> who were hired to find him. A battle ensued.</p><p>His next run in was with both The Darkhold Redeemers, Ghost Rider, and Blaze. He would soon end up fighting both <a href=\"/morbius/4005-6722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6722\"> Morbius</a> and Spider-Man in a fight in which the rest of the <a href=\"/midnight-sons/4060-26574/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26574\"> Midnight Sons</a> would join in on. While he was fighting the Midnight Sons, <a href=\"/paralyzer/4005-47642/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47642\"> Paralyzer</a> let loose a powerful monster called <a href=\"/zzzax/4005-13812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13812\"> Zzzax</a> that interrupted the fight. Morbius hypnotized Spider-X, causing him to fight the powerful monster. Spider-X met defeat as Zzzax began to devour him alive. The Midnight Sons used the opportunity to focus their efforts and destroy ZzzaX.</p>",

Skinner laments how Blaze destroyed the only thing he had left of his human family; their skin which he wore. Ghost Rider arrives in time to aid Blaze who shoots hellfire from his shotgun into Skinner over and over again. As they leave, Skinner  rises from the flames again.<br/><br/>Months later after Lilith's second return, Skinner got himself back to health and went after Blaze again this time seriously wounding him almost killing him.<br/><br/>He would later appear in the Black Hole where he almost killed the robot wright until he was stopped by Ghost Rider.</p>",

    "deck": "Sodam Yat is a Daxamite, the Green Lantern of Space Sector 1760, and former host of the Ion Entity. He's also prophesied as the Greatest of All the Green Lantern Corps.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Born and raised on the planet <a href=\"/daxam/4020-42416/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42416\">Daxam</a>, the young Sodam Yat was fascinated by the stars and the worlds beyond his own, and rebelled against his xenophobic society when an alien named Tessog crash landed on Daxam. He and Tessog transcended their language barrier to become close friends, and Yat helped to protect and care for the wounded alien, until he was discovered by Yat's parents. They killed Tessog and brainwashed their son, convincing him that Tessog, like all aliens, was a menace to <a href=\"/daxamites/4060-42480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42480\">Daxamite</a> society. Several years later, upon encountering Tessog's body stuffed and mounted in a museum, Yat's true memories flood back and he resolves to flee his planet. He manages to repair Tessog's ship, but prior to his departure he is met by a <a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">Green Lantern ring</a>, which chooses him as its new bearer. Yat is unaware that he is the subject of a prophecy which heralds him as a great Green Lantern, but also as the sign of the end for the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Corps</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Sodam Yat was created by <a href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\">Alan Moore</a> and <a href=\"/kevin-oneill/4040-42076/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42076\">Kevin O'Neill</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Sinestro Corps War</h3><p>Yat is called upon, along with several other new graduates, to aid in the fighting during the <a href=\"/sinestro-corps-war/4045-50650/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-50650\">Sinestro Corps War</a>. <a href=\"/arisia/4005-2046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2046\">Arisia</a> is set to watch him due to the prophecy, and he travels along with a number of other Lanterns to <a href=\"/mogo/4005-41919/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41919\">Mogo</a>. There, he takes part in the fighting to defend Mogo against <a href=\"/sinestro-corps/4060-42352/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42352\">Sinestro Corps</a> incursions. During the fighting Yat distinguishes himself, displaying uncommon skill in his defeat of numerous members of the Sinestro Corps. He is sent on the assault of <a href=\"/ranx/4005-51907/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51907\">Ranx</a>, and shows himself to be a capable leader and skilled Lantern, single-handedly destroying the sentient city. He is then called to fight on <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a> where he again takes the role of leader and impresses his fellow Lanterns. Upon the <a href=\"/anti-monitor/4005-12165/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12165\">Anti-Monitor's</a> arrival he challenges him himself. He is struck down several times, but manages to rally thanks in part to his Daxamite heritage, and survives the encounter thanks to the intervention of the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\">Guardians</a>.</p><h3>Ion</h3><p>Yat is chosen as the new <a href=\"/ion/4015-55697/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55697\">Ion</a> following the infection of <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\">Kyle Rayner</a> by the entity <a href=\"/parallax/4005-41293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\">Parallax</a>. His first opponent after his Ion transformation is <a href=\"/superboy-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\">Superboy-Prime</a>. He and Prime wage a fierce battle that suddenly turns against Yat when he realizes his weakness to lead upon being weakened by lead shielding. Despite his efforts, he is defeated by Prime. His exposure to lead during their fight leaves him dependent on his ring to keep the lead poisoning at bay. He later receives training from Kyle Rayner in the use of his Ion powers. He and Rayner fight the newly-escaped <a href=\"/nero/4005-10455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10455\">Alexander Nero</a>, and Yat displays newfound proficiency with his powers, ultimately winning the battle and defeating Nero.</p><h3>Final Crisis</h3><p>Yat is informed of the death of <a href=\"/orion/4005-2363/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2363\">Orion</a> on Earth, and later of the fact that <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a> has been accused of murder. He attends Jordan's trial alongside Arisia, and is among the honour guard that is attacked when <a href=\"/kraken/4005-49677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49677\">Kraken</a> reveals that it is she who is under the influence of a dark god. Yat then volunteered to join Jordan on Earth to confront <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a>. He later joined the Corps in standing before the <a href=\"/the-monitors/4060-48220/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48220\">Monitor</a> <a href=\"/nix-uotan/4005-49070/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49070\">Nix Uotan</a>, fighting <a href=\"/mandrakk/4005-59487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59487\">Mandrakk</a>, and repairing the <a href=\"/dc-multiverse/4015-43603/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43603\">Multiverse</a>.</p><h3>Legion of Three Worlds</h3><p>A future version of Yat, the last surviving member of the Lantern Corps, is encountered by <a href=\"/mon-el/4005-21508/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21508\">Mon-El</a> and <a href=\"/shadow-lass/4005-1261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1261\">Shadow Lass</a> on the ruined remains of <a href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\">Oa</a>. Broken by past failures and the deaths of all his fellow Lanterns, Yat is reluctant to aid the pair in their fight against Superboy-Prime. They eventually manage to convince him, and he absorbs the power of all the rings that lie scattered across Oa and goes to confront Prime and the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-villains/4060-47190/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47190\">Legion of Super-Villains</a> alongside his new allies. Following the battle, he decides that the universe needs continued protection, and restarts the Lantern Corps.</p><h3>Ring Quest</h3><p>Yat is charged, along with a number of other Lanterns, to travel into the <a href=\"/vega-system/4020-55817/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55817\">Vega System</a> and capture several <a href=\"/sinestro-corps-ring/4055-53415/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-53415\">Sinestro Corps rings</a> which haven't yet found bearers. This quest leads Yat to the planet <a href=\"/sedas/4020-57536/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57536\">Sedas</a>, where he and Arisia are captured by <a href=\"/duel-eknham/4005-53386/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53386\">Duel</a> and <a href=\"/mongul/4005-12162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12162\">Mongul</a>. They are subjected to the <a href=\"/black-mercy/4055-54815/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-54815\">black mercy</a>, but are rescued by the other Lanterns. Before they are able to fully recover, the Lanterns are attacked by <a href=\"/matris-ater-clementia/4005-56518/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56518\">Mother Mercy</a>. Yat, still suffering from the effects of the black mercy, manages to injure Mother Mercy, earning the Lanterns a brief reprieve. The Lanterns then negotiate with Mother Mercy, who releases both Yat and Arisia from the black mercies. Attacked by Mongul yet again, the Lanterns are secretly aided by Mother Mercy, and Yat and the others manage to defeat Mongul and Duel.</p><h3>New Krypton</h3><p>Yat is sent to Earth to work alongside Hal Jordan, who is assessing the threat posed by the newly freed <a href=\"/kryptonians/4060-45710/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45710\">Kryptonians</a> of <a href=\"/kandor/4020-41290/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41290\">Kandor</a>. He joins the Earth Lanterns in their tour of <a href=\"/new-krypton/4020-56084/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56084\">New Krypton</a> and helps to capture a saboteur before returning to his hunt for Sinestro Corps members. Shortly afterwards he attempts to return to Earth to inform Mon-El about the truth of Daxam's history, but is stopped by <a href=\"/tellus/4005-30996/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30996\">Tellus</a>, who warns him that continuing on may bring about a chain of events that allows evil to win. Yat entrusts the knowledge crystals about Daxam to Tellus, and returns to Oa.</p><h3>Sins of the Scarlet Sapphire</h3><p>Yat is summoned to act as an escort and guard for some members of the Guardians during their negotiations with the <a href=\"/zamarons/4060-39176/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-39176\">Zamarons</a>. Yat is instructed that, should negotiations fall through, he is to lay waste to the Zamaron capital and the <a href=\"/star-sapphire-corps/4060-49913/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49913\">Star Sapphire</a> Central Power Battery. When no hostilities result from the meeting, he returns to Oa.</p><h3>Emerald Eclipse</h3><p>Yat is distracted from his tasks by the sudden arrival of his <a href=\"/cara-yat/4005-61442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61442\">mother</a>, who crash lands Tellog's repaired ship near where he is holding a prisoner in a <a href=\"/sciencells/4055-55796/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55796\">sciencell</a>. She informs him that Daxam is under siege from members of the Sinestro Corps, and begs his intervention. He initially refuses, angrily explaining how his parents had treated him and Tellog, and claiming that their own xenophobia was responsible for their having no allies to turn to. Eventually he relents, but only after forcing his mother to express gratitude to Tellog. He and Arisia travel to Daxam, where he finds his <a href=\"/diro-yat/4005-61434/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61434\">father</a> advocating mass suicide rather than allowing Daxamites to fall into the hands of the Sinestro Corps. They rescue these Daxamites, and confront and kill several Sinestro Corpsmen, despite Arisia's vocal opposition to lethal force. Yat then confronts Mongul on his own, and is prevented from accessing his Ion powers due to the influence of the Guardian <a href=\"/scar/4005-56693/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56693\">Scar</a>. He is able to unlock partial Ion powers only by allowing himself to be struck with one of Mongul's energy blasts. He manages to defeat several Sinestro Corpsmen, but with his powers rapidly fading he is forced to sacrifice himself. Allowing himself to part with his ring to prevent Guardian interference, he plunges into the sun. He changes the red sun to a yellow one with a powerful release of energy, allowing the Daxamites to use their new powers to fight off the remaining invaders. Trapped in the sun, Yat apparently dies.</p><h3>Brightest Day</h3><p>An unknown being approaches Daxam's sun, where Yat remains, apparently dead, and removes the Ion entity from him. Yat plunges out of the sun to the surface of Daxam, alive but unconscious. He is located and rescued by a small group of Daxamites who revere him for the great sacrifice he had made for them. They warn him of the plan amongst some Daxamites to locate him and throw him back into the sun in the hopes of regaining their powers. Yat announces that, in order to fix the xenophobic Daxamite society, they must first make the whole universe a better place. He leads his followers on a mission to bring the Guardians to justice for their sins.</p><h3>New 52</h3><p>Sodam Yat was reintroduced into the New 52. He appears as a prisoner of the Durlans on the planet Corona Seven, of Space Sector 700. The Durlans captured him, experimented on him in an attempt to learn how to mimic his form, removed his ring and interrogated him about his home planet of Daxam. Arisia Rhab was overjoyed to see him alive. After the battle with the Durlans, Sodam goes into exile and renounces the Green Lantern ring.</p><p><img style=\"width:451px;height:741px;\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11121/111213476/4335688-untitled.jpg\" /></p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As a Daxamite, Yat possesses all the powers inherent to his race.</p><ul><li><b>Daxamite Physiology: </b>As a sister race of the Kryptonians, Daxamites are entitled to the same powers.</li><li><b>Solar Energy Absorption: </b>Due to his Daxamite physiology, Sodam is capable of absorbing. storing and metabolizing the solar radiation of yellow stars/suns, allowing him to use his races inherent powers.</li><li><b>Super</b> <strong>Strength: </strong>Sodam has tremendous amounts of strength. this strength allows him to lift megatons and battle the likes of Superboy-Prime on an almost even playing field.</li><li><b>Super Speed: </b>Sodam is capable of enhanced reflexes reactions to catch bullets, and physical speeds similar to The Flash, but not quite as fast.</li><li><b>Invulnerability: </b>Sodam is extremely durable to the point were he can survive the destruction of the living city Ranx and withstand blows from the power crazed Superboy-Prime.</li><li><b>Heat vision: </b>Sodam can released stored solar radiation as beams of extreme heat from his eyes.</li><li><b>Flight: </b>Sodam can psionicly manipulate his own gravitational field allowing him to fly at multi-mach speeds.</li><li><b>Healing Factor: </b>When sufficiently charged, Sodam can regenerate massive amounts of damaged tissue in a relatively short amount of time. upon surviving the destruction of Ranx, the damage Sodam received was completely healed a few minutes after returning to his Lantern squad.</li></ul><h3>Weaknesses</h3><ul><li><b>Lead: </b>Lead is highly poisonous to all Daxamites. even being in the presence of a small amount has a similar effect on them as Kryptonite does to Kryptonians. If it were not for the lead in his fight against Superboy-Prime, Sodam would have had a fare chance of winning.</li><li><b>Red Solar Radiation: </b>Just like all Daxamites and Kryptonians, Sodam loses all of the powers a yellow star gives him.</li></ul><p> </p><p>As a Green Lantern, Yat possesses a Green Lantern ring which can be wielded to a variety of effects, and is essentially constrained only by his own creativity. He can use the ring to, among other things, create energy constructs, wield energy blasts, and heal himself or others. Among other functions, the ring operates as an assisting artificial intelligence, a means of spaceflight, and a communicator.</p><p> </p><p>As Ion, Yat had access to powers similar to those of a Green Lantern, but on a greater scale. As Ion, he possessed the combined energy of all of the Guardians, and had theoretically limitless abilities. Known abilities possessed by Ion-wielders include the ability to raise the dead; to manipulate or alter reality, time, and matter; and to be functionally immortal.</p>",

Enormous in stature, up to 2000 feet in height, they possess the ability to manipulate reality, control vast levels of energy and rearrange matter up to an unknown degree They can teleport themselves or vast objects across vast distances. If harmed they will regenerate near instantaneously. Capable of withstanding earth shattering blows and greater Celestials also possess the ability to generate energy blasts that are of an earth shattering level and higher. There is an unknown connection between the Celestials and Hyperspace. It is possible that Hyperspace is the origin of the Celestials vast powers.

    "description": "<p> </p><h2>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</h2><p><strong>Tommy Oliver</strong></p><p>In the first season of <a href=\"/power-rangers/4060-46181/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46181\"> Power Rangers</a>, the Sixth Ranger is the <a href=\"/green-power-ranger/4005-56670/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56670\"> Green Dragon Ranger</a>, Tommy Oliver (Jason David Frank). Tommy is a new student at Angel Grove High, and he entered a martial arts tournament that Jason was in. The two fought, Tommy showing that his fighting skills were equivalent of Jason's. This caught the attention both Kimberly, the <a href=\"/pink-power-ranger/4005-46151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46151\"> Pink Ranger</a> and Rita Repulsa. Rita captured him and, using the special Green Ranger powers she possessed, cast an evil spell over him, turning him into the Green Dragon Ranger.</p><p> </p><p>In his first encounter with the Rangers, he defeats them easily. After continued attempts of trying to get to the Tommy underneath the ranger, and succeed. Jason destroyed the Sword of Darkness, the source of the evil spell over Tommy, allowing him to join up with the other rangers, becoming the first ever Sixth Ranger.</p><p> </p><p>After Rita's continuous streak of losses against the Power Rangers with the help of Tommy, she set out to get back the Green Ranger powers she believed were hers. Using a special green candle, she slowly drained the Ranger powers from Tommy. Jason tried to enter the Dark Dimension where it was held, as well as where Tommy was being held prisoner, but he couldn't get there because of the relentless monster attacks by Rita. As Tommy's powers faded, he transferred the Dragon Powers to Jason to keep Rita from getting her hands on them.</p><p> </p><p>He left the rangers for a short time, but came back after Rita kidnapped the parents of every student at Angel Grove High. He still had the Dragon Power Coin and morphed, knowing that each time he morphed it would weaken him. <a href=\"/zordon/4005-51750/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51750\"> Zordon </a>granted him a temporary power boost so he could continue to morph. But, Lord Zedd ultimately destroyed his powers, permanently.</p><p> </p><p>Tommy spent awhile away from the Rangers, but after Zedd unleashed his Nimrod monster, Alpha 5 and Zordon knew it was time to make a new Ranger. They made Tommy the new White Ranger, a ranger whose powers couldn't be used for evil. He wielded his talking sword, Saba to summon the White Tigerzord.</p><h2>Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers</h2><p><strong>Delphine</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\"

the Omega S.P.D Ranger</figcaption></figure><p>Sam was originally a lonely boy with no friends, who couldn't fit in the other kids. As result he was constantly bullied and made fun of for being different. Sam had the genetic ability to teleport objects as well as create illusions, something the other kids teased him for. Though he was misled into joining the Troobians, he rewrote his wrongs and joined S.P.D as a young cadet. 20 years later, Sam would grow into the S.P.D Omega Ranger, travelling back in time to assist the S.P.D with their crisis in hopes of changing the future. As a boy he was eagerly excited to become a power ranger and as an adult he had developed an optimistic outlook, following orders without question and using his brain more than the rest of his team. Being the Omega Ranger, Sam wears a wrist-mounted Omega Morpher, a highly advanced futuristic S.P.D technology. He also pilots the Omegamax Cycle which can transform into the Omegamax Megazord.</p><h2>Power Rangers: Mystic Force</h2><p><strong>Udonna</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4508645-300x300.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4508645\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4508645-300x300.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4508645\"><img alt=\"Udonna as the White Mystic Ranger\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4508645-300x300.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4508645-300x300.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Udonna as the White Mystic Ranger\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4508645-300x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4508645-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Udonna as the White Mystic Ranger</figcaption></figure><p>Udonna was once a powerful sorceress, the loyal wife of Leanbow and mother of Bowen. After the Great Battle of Good and Evil, she lost her husband and son, spending the next several years alone with her niece Claire. When dark magic arose she chose five teenagers to fulfil their destinies of becoming the Mystic Force. Udonna became the White Mystic Force Power Ranger wielding her mighty Snow Staff into battle. Though she lost her Snow Staff to Koragg near the beginning of the season, she would later reclaim her artifact, becoming the powerful sorceress she once was. She would later reunite with her lost husband Leanbow (Koragg) and her son Bowen (Nick Russell) after many years of separation from them and become a family once again. Udonna is a caring and wise mentor to the Mystic Force during the first arc.</p><h2>Power Rangers: Jungle Fury</h2><p><strong>Dominic Hargan</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4552394-domrhino04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4552394\" data-ratio=\"0.72560975609756\" data-width=\"328\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 328px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4552394-domrhino04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4552394\"><img alt=\"Dominic as the White Rhino Ranger\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px\" data-width=\"328\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4552394-domrhino04.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4552394-domrhino04.png 328w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dominic as the White Rhino Ranger\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4552394-domrhino04.png\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111154974/4552394-domrhino04.png 328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px\" data-width=\"328\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dominic as the White Rhino Ranger</figcaption></figure><p> </p>",

In time, Bernard Dempsey was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and currently resides in a nursing home. If the serum and the Alzheimer's have any correlation have yet to be determined. </p><p>As Whiptail, Bernard Dempsey had super strength, agility, claws and invulnerability.

    "description": "<h2>History</h2>Augie Ford, who first appeared in <i>Dynamo 5</i> #2, has been an agent of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45541\" href=\"/flag/4060-45541/\" slug=\"flag\">F.L.A.G.</a> for 30 years, and is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43662\" href=\"/maddie-warner/4005-43662/\" slug=\"maddie-warner\">Warner</a>'s ex-partner. His current partner is Nicole Nakamura. Ford has long-harbored a romantic attraction to Warner, feelings which still linger. He first appears in <i>Dynamo 5</i> #2, in which he pays her a visit to ask her if she is associated with this new team using her late husband's name, but she denies it. Because this visit occurs during a series of rampages by the villain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46188\" href=\"/whiptail/4005-46188/\" slug=\"whiptail\">Whiptail</a>, he also tells her that F.L.A.G. is trying to reverse-engineer Whiptail's serum in order to track him by scent. After Warner had been captured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45539\" href=\"/chrysalis/4005-45539/\" slug=\"chrysalis\">Chrysalis</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\" slug=\"synergy\">Synergy</a>, and four members of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" slug=\"dynamo-5\">Dynamo 5</a> had been captured by F.L.A.G., Augie encountered <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43663\" href=\"/slingshot/4005-43663/\" slug=\"slingshot\">Slingshot</a> at Warner's apartment, at which point he learned the truth of Warner's involvement with the team. Ford proposed to help Slingshot free her siblings by having her pose as a fellow F.L.A.G. agent when returning to F.L.A.G. headquarters, but when they encountered Ford's superior Sandy, Ford turned Slingshot in. In <i>Dynamo 5</i> #7, He then knocked his superior, Sandy, unconscious, and helped Slingshot free her siblings, later telling Sandy that the man who attacked him must have been a disguised <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43661\" href=\"/myriad/4005-43661/\" slug=\"myriad\">Myriad</a>. Ford has continued to aid the team when possible, as when he contacted the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55524\" href=\"/the-noble-family/4060-55524/\" slug=\"the-noble-family\">Noble Family</a> after Dynamo 5 rescued Warner from a hostage situation, during which she had fallen into a comatose state. He served in Warner's place as the team's tactical eyes and ears until she came out of this state.   <br/><br/>",

    "deck": "Millennium's Huntress and eventual familiar for the Hellsing Organization's vampire Alucard. Wields a flintlock musket with magic bullets, that \"punish all without distinction\".",
    "description": "<p>Rip Van Winkle was a First Lieutenant for Millennium, nicknamed the Huntress. She, like future officers the Major, the Doctor and the Captain, was first chronologically seen in the Order 666 camp in Warsaw, during the events of <i>Hellsing: The Dawn. </i>She, an <i>Untersturmfuhrer</i>, was first seen as a pathetic figure, farsighted, incapable of realizing that Alucard, in a shape similar to a small girl, is the enemy, until it is too late and his coffin knocks her out. She was one of the few survivors of the destruction of the camp. Later, she joined Millennium, eventually making it to the elite Werwolf team, though she apparently retained a phobia of Alucard, referring to him as the Black Huntsman Zamiel, in a reference to her favorite opera, <i>Die Freischutz</i>. She also was prone to liken herself to <i>Die Freischutz</i>'s main character, a huntsman named Kaspar, who is eventually killed and draged to Hell by Zamiel.<br/><br/>She was chosen to lead a Millennium strike team to take possession and defend Millennium's propriety of a British VTOL warship, the <i>Eagle</i>, surrendered by traitorous, vampirized Englishmen. While she did so, she also executed another of her orders: to eliminate the traitors, stating Millennium wasn't interested in their services. She then proceeded to rename the <i>Eagle</i> as the <i>Alder</i> and declare it a Nazi warship under the service of Millennium, painting a massive swastika in red paint in the main deck. Her defensive task was aided by her old-fashioned musket, capable of firing magic warheads capable of penetrating heavy armor and repeteadly hit an object, returning and changing paths several times in midair. She used this ability to bring down missiles and choppers alike, effectively defending the newly-christened <i>Alder.</i><br/><br/>Hellsing, deciding not to allow such a powerful ship under foreign control so near England landmass, sent their greatest vampire agent, Alucard, to deal with the threat of Van Winkle. Equipped with an extremely fast spy jet, Alucard rammed the jet into the <i>Alder</i> itself at the plane's top speed, so even if the terrified Van Winkle or the ship's defenses managed to hit him, he still would hit the ship. Despite the Millennium soldiers' attempts, Alucard reemerged and destroyed them all before focusing on Van Winkle.  She then attempted to force him off the deck and into the water by using another magic bullet, but just before she triumphed, Alucard caught the bullet in his mouth. He then executed Van Winkle upon her own musket and drain her blood in a very slow pace, turning Van Winkle into his familiar. Schrodinger appeared and informed Van Winkle the Major had decided not to fry her through her chip and instead ordered the entire Millennium crew to Heil her, bidding her \"Auf Wiedersen\" before the invasion fleet reached for England. The plan was, since Alucard could not pass through the ocean without external means of locomotion such as a boat or a plane, he would remain stranded upon the reclaimed <i>Eagle</i> until it was too late. This plan failed, and Alucard made it to land safely.<br/> <br/>She would later reappear as Alucard summoned his strongest familiars, at first partly merged with fellow Millennium lieutenant Tubalcain Alhambra. They both used their special abilities to shoot down Enrico Maxwell's helicopter and destroy the Millennium invasion, until they were killed by the holy fire extending from the gaping wound Paladin Alexander Anderson inflicted upon Alucard with a Nail of Helena-enhanced silver bayonet.</p>",

    "deck": "The most annoying stuffed hero to walk the world, Kon always has something to say.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Kon is a Modified Soul, or Kaizo Konpaku.  In his first form that was ever seen he resembles a spherical Pez candy.  That is until he is consumed by Ichigo, then he inhabits Ichigo's body until he is removed by Rukia or someone else with a means of seperating souls from bodies.  After his first adventures in Ichigo's body the gang finds a new body for the loud mouthed personality to inhabit, a stuffed animal lion.  In this body Kon is a tan-ish lion doll with short triangular fingerd and mane.  His mouth is a lighter beige and at one different times he has various \"accessories\", like a flower on his ear or a cross stitched into the back of his \"scalp.\"</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Personality</h2><p>Kon pretty much has a very easily described personality: annoying, perverted, and loud.  The little guy tends to run off at the mouth a lot, usually resulting in him getting stepped on, or chased. When Kon isn't running his mouth he usually has one goal,, hooking up with a beautiful woman.  Kon has an obsession with meeting the right lady and finding his \"paradise\" with her (pretty easy to know what he means when you realize he stares at women's chest a lot.)  Occassionally Kon does show a nobler side, puting his pride and own self in harms way to help others.<br/></p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Involvment in Bleach</h2> *Random Stories at the Series Onset*<p>The first time Kon is introduced is in his own introductory story line.  When Rukia realizes that she may not alway be around to help Ichigo escape his body to fight Hollows she does the first thing that comes to mind, find a new means to get Ichigo out of his body.  Rukia pays a visit to the Urahara Shop ,owned by Kisuke Urahara, and orders a Soul Candy dispenser.  The item is a common looking Pez despenser with a duck head at the top and the words Soul Candy, Gikongan in Japan, emblazed on the side.  Inside of the dispenser is a small candy that Ichigo had to ingest whenever he needs to turn Soul Reaper.  The first time that Ichigo eats the candy he meets a nice and overly friendly personality that is only too eager to cover for him while he runs about.  Shortly after leaving the Mod Soul behind though, Kon starts to act up.  It turns out that Kon is one of the last experimental Mod Souls that was suppose to be returned to the Soul Society so that he can be destroyed.  There happens to be a few problems problem with the Mod Souls as it turns out.  One is that they all have strange personalities that tend to get in the way of their purpose.  Another is that the Mod Souls have to remove a soul from it's body or inhabit an already empty body, realizing the problems that this would createthe Soul Society deauthorizes the project and it's products.  For reasons unknown Kon's batch of Mod Souls was shipped and recalled, but never made it back before it was accidentally given to Rukia.  It is explained also that these Mod Souls do have the benifit of having hieghtened strengths depending on their uses.  It turns out Kon's strength is in his legs.  Kon demonstrates this by kicking a massive dent into a barrier at the edge of on of the school tracks before running off to find some more fun.  The first thing that Kon does is jump from the ground to a second or third story window to find people who would be amazed by his shows of stregnth.  However Kon finds himself in the last place he should be, the class room that all the female class mates of Ichigo eat at.  Instantly Kon begins to look for the prettiest one, and spots Orihime.  Love struck Kon begins to hit on Orihime, but is stopped by Tatsuki (one of the schools best martial artist.)  Not to be stopped Kon states that Tatsuki is kind of cute, and gives her a kiss.  The instant he does this all hell breaks lose and tatsuki begins to throw desk and whatever else she can get at Kon.  As he runs around the room Ichigo and Rukia return to the chaos of the classroom. Before they can get Kon back into his body he makes a run and jumps out the window that Ichigo is standing by.  The two chase after him and have to stop chasing him to find a Hollow.  While resting after his chase Kon stops by a school yard where three young boys are skipping gym to play video games.  The boys are complaining that their characters aren't strong enough and end up bragging as they delete them.  Upset by the kids cold and careless comments and actions Kon smashes their game.  He then begins to contemplate how he had just missed the same fate as the video game character, but was luck enough to escape being erased.  About this time a Hollow appears at the school wanting to attack the easy prey that the kids present themselves as.  Kon sees it and attacks, trying to protect the kids from being eatten.  Ichigo and Rukia show up in time to kill the Hollow, but Kon keeps attacking.  Angry that the Mod Soul put his body in the way of danger Ichigo begins to yell at Kon.  When Ichigo asks why Kon wouldn't stop he sees a small line of ants and realizes that Kon stopped the Hollow's body from crushing them.  Kon finally shows his inner nobility and explains that he doesn't ever want to see anything ever get killed.</p> *A New Body and Some New Adventures*<p>Shortly after the Hollow is defeated Kisuke and his team show up to retrieve the Mod Soul, but Rukia refuses to let them take it back after hearing about the soul's anguish inside the candy.  Ichigo and Rukia then set out to find Kon a new body.  At first they try to find an animal to put the soul in, but don't want to kill one, and can't find a cat on the side of the road either.  Finally they decide to try a stuffed animal that they find instead.  The two are surprised to find that it works, but are annoyed to find that Kon gains all his annoying personality traits too.  Ichigo is awoken the next morning by Kon and begins to worry that he may bave made a mistake.</p> #Memories In the Rain#<p>While Ichigo and his family set out to spend the day at the graveyard to visit their mother's grave Kon and Rukia tag along to make sure there are now Hollows.  After Rukia confronts Ichigo about the possibility that his mother may have been killed by a Hollow Rukia decides that she may have chosen the wrong time to talk to Ichigo about it.  As her and Kon are about to leave the graveyard Rukia gets a notice from the Soul Society that a Hollow is inbound on the cemetary.  Rukia  leaves to find Ichigo, who is already on his way to find her. Rukia seperates ichigo's soul from his body and realizes that she can't carry his body and help him, so she forces Kon to release from the stuffed animal and take over Ichigo's body.  Rukia helps to move Ichigo's sisters back to a shrine while it rains and then debates as to if she is gonna go to help Ichigo or not.  Kon finally begs on his hands and knees for Rukia to help Ichigo.  Rukia pleads with Kon to stop begging, but kon insist that if Rukia doesn't help Ichigo then he will have to live with Ichigo's family if she doesn't help Ichigo.  Rukia finally takes off and leaves Kon in Ichigo until the battle is over.</p> *More Randomness in Kon's life*<p>After the cemetary adventure Kon decides that he is misunderstood and under appreciated by Rukia and Ichigo.  Kon decides to run away to find a girl who will love him and, this is kinda weird for a guy who have stuffing for his inside I know, take baths with him.  Kon wanders out of the Kurosaki clinic and finds his way to a park where he sees Orihime and Tatsuki.  Kon feels this is the best time to get Orihime's attention and runs down to act like a lost stuffed animal so she will take him home.  Unfortunately Orihime  and Tatsuki are playing a new hybrid game that Orihime created. Kon is slammed by a soccer ball, which is kicked by Tatsuki using her Dragon Bazooka Kick, and then Kon is sent flying from the park as Orihime crushes the ball using a baseball bat.  Finding himself far away and still in need of a new Home Kon notices a cluster of other girls from Ichigo's school walking down the street.  Kon unleashes his originaly scheme and falls just infront of the girls, acting like a lost stuffed animal.  Kon's plan is foiled though as Ryo steps on him.  Kon cries out and realizes that he has made a mistake.  Ryo and the others decide to try and catch him so that they can use him to make money.  Kon jumps up and runs from the girls, only to have Ryo take off after him, bragging about her speed as she is the school's fastest track runner.  As Kon passes one corner he unintentionally catches the attention of Chad, who loves cute objects.  kon manages to lose the two of them somehow and returns to the clinic, where he collapses from exhaustion.  Kon is saved as Yuzu opens the door and sees Kon. Kon thinks that he is saved and begins to enjoy his pampering as Yuzu bath hims and takes him to her room.  That is until Yuzu begins dressing him as a girl and sticky glues a flower to his ear.  Kon eventually makes his way back to Ichigo's room where he is finds out that neither of Rukia or Ichigo have missed him.  They do however attempt to remove the flower and nearly tear off his ear.</p> *Quincy Archer and Battle of the Rubicon*<p>When Ichigo gets involved in a battle the Quincy Archer Uryu Ishida Kon does what he does best, get in the way and does nothing to help.  While Ichigo is running around trying to find and defend his family from the Hollows Kon is sent out to get Rukia's locator.  Kon eventually finds Rukia and instead of getting locator Kon tries to \"snuggle\" with Rukia, who puts him in a submission lock.  When Uryu finds the two he destroys the Hollow they were fighting.  Ichigo shows up to settle the score... with Kon.  Ichigo and Uryu end up finishing their battle against the Hollows while Kon recovers from a knee to the groin.</p> *Soul Society Arc.*<p>Kon isn't seen much while Ichigo and his friends are out in the Soul Society, but he is seen briefly before they leav.  Ichigo finds Kon taped to the back of the toilet after Rukia runs off, complaining about what he had to endure while stuck to the back of the toilet.  Kon is eventually placed in Ichigo's body while Ichigo goes to save Rukia.  Kon gets upset and throws his stuffed animal body, only to gently pick it up and return to Ichigo's bed.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Kon doesn't have much as far as powers go, but he does excel in one area, leg strength.  Kon is a Mod Soul that was programmed to have super strength in his legs, which gives him several other abilities.  Kon can use his leg strength to kick his enemies with enough strength to destroy a Hollow.  He also uses his strength to jump to inhuman hieghts, actually jumps high enough to get into a second and third story window.  Kon even uses his leg's strength to run well beyond the speed that most people can move at, outrunning a high school track star in a stuffed animal body.</p>",

Synergy was the product of their union Synergy thus making her one of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\"> Captain Dynamo's </a>love children.   Cyntia's parents exposed her to the same radiation that gave Captain Dynamo his powers, Cynthia inherited all of her father's special abilities. One of Captain Dynamo's favorite things to do was to fly with Cynthia. <br/> <br/>When the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" slug=\"dynamo-5\"> Dynamo 5</a> were battling the Captain's ally <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46191\" href=\"/quake/4005-46191/\" slug=\"quake\"> Quake</a> (who was off his meds) <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\"> Captain Dynamo </a>arrived to talk him down.  Originally <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43661\" href=\"/myriad/4005-43661/\" slug=\"myriad\"> Myriad</a> was to impersonate Captain Dynamo but he did not arrive until after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\"> Captain Dynamo </a>had stopped <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46191\" href=\"/quake/4005-46191/\" slug=\"quake\"> Quake</a>'s rampage.  Captain Dynamo finally approached Maddie Warner, Dynamo's widow and after kissing the two flew off.  Captain Dynamo brought Maddie to a secret lair belonging to Chrsalis.  It was here that Cynthia revealed herself to Maddie and her mother informed Maddie of Cynthia's paternity.   The duo thought to use this information to hurt Maddie but the widow laughed in the duo's faces.  She then revealed that  Chrysalis was not Dynamo's only lover, nor was Cynthia was not his only child.  Cynthia confirmed this using her telepathy much to Chrysalis' dismay.<br/> <br/>At the behest of Chrysalis, Synergy attempts to kill Maddie Warner. However, Maddie Warner injects herself with a serum, becoming the latest <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46188\" href=\"/whiptail/4005-46188/\" slug=\"whiptail\"> Whiptail</a>. Maddie was able to defeat Synergy, with the help of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" slug=\"dynamo-5\"> Dynamo 5</a>.   Synergy's half-brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43659\" href=\"/scatterbrain/4005-43659/\" slug=\"scatterbrain\"> Gage </a>then used his telepathy to make his sister forget her villainous ways and give her a fresh start.  Maddy leaves her at a school for girls.<br/><br/>Recently a man posing as a priest shot Cythinia in the head (knowing it would not kill her).  The bullet jogged her memory and she is now planning her revenge on her half-siblings.  Father Gideon had Cynthia impersonate people and steal items for a special purpose with the promise that he would help her free her mother.  The two began a sexual relationship and when they stole a special weapon from F.L.A.G. Father Gideon revealed that Maddie Warrner was his mother. <br/> <br/>Gideon's plan was to use the weapon to remove the powers from the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" slug=\"dynamo-5\"> Dynamo 5</a>.  Cynthia was able to do this easily by shape shifting into Maddie and then used the weapon.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43664\" href=\"/scrap/4005-43664/\" slug=\"scrap\"> Scrap</a> managed to give her a great deal of trouble but Cynthia used in on her while she was trying to save an innocent trapped under a car. <br/> <br/>Several miscalculations however caused the plan to go south.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43661\" href=\"/myriad/4005-43661/\" slug=\"myriad\"> Spencer</a>, being half alien, was stronger and more agile than a normal human and was able to break his bonds and free one of his sisters.  Briget was the first to get free but found she no longer had super strength.  When Synergy was about to kill her sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43663\" href=\"/slingshot/4005-43663/\" slug=\"slingshot\"> Olivia</a>, Bridget's eye beams manifested and sent the distured girl flying.  As the others powers began to kick in she was able to hold her own against her siblings (as she was in full control of her powers).  However Spencer convinced her to use her telepathy on Michael to see if he was being honest.  She did so and found out that Michael had no intentions of helping her free her mother.  She knocked the fake priest out and fled.<br/><br/><br/></p><a href=\"///\"> </a> <h2>Powers</h2> <p>Synergy inherited the abilities of her biological father, Captain Dynamo, and was exposed to the same mysterious radiation that gave him his powers. These powers include flight, super strength, invulnerability, telepathy, shape shifting and vision powers.</p>",

    "deck": "Genkai is a character from the manga/anime Yu Yu Hakusho. Genkai is a powerful psychic and mentor to Yusuke Urameshi. She is also the creator of several powerful techniques including the energy orb.",
    "description": "<p>The old Genkai first comes to Yusuke's attention in his second Spirit Detective case, in which he was to stop a demon named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46443\" href=\"/rando/4005-46443/\" slug=\"rando\">     Rando</a> from learning Genkai's Reikou Hadouken fighting style. Genkai was holding a tournament because of her old age, and the knowledge of her techniques were to go to the winner. After a bit of a bumbling ordeal, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45374\" href=\"/yusuke-urameshi/4005-45374/\" slug=\"yusuke-urameshi\">    Yusuke</a> managed to defeat Rando and become Genkai's pupil. It was the beginning of a very tempestuous teacher-student relationship. They constantly trash talk each other, and Genkai will frequently beat up or otherwise humble Yusuke, but deep down Yusuke respects Genkai and Genkai recognizes the untapped potential in the Spirit Detective...and the fact that it takes just the right situation to coax it out of him. It's from Genkai that Yusuke enhances his Spirit Gun and learns the Shotgun technique, among others.</p><p>Genkai re-emerges during the Dark Tournament, first by training Yusuke for an additional three months. Then, a mysterious masked fighter emerges to fill out Yusuke's team of fighters. Yusuke assumes from the stature and size that it's Genkai, but a brief glimpse under the mask during a melee with Dr. Ichigaki's team throws the initial assumption for a loop. Under the mask, the fighter looked young and rather attractive.</p><p>But in the late stages of the tournament, Genkai reveals herself to Yusuke and reveals the secret of that change in appearance. When one exerts his or her spiritual utmost, the body changes to accommodate, and Genkai's prime was when she was in her twenties (that's the lady we saw earlier). She joined the team because the Dark Tournament is the perfect venue for Yusuke to fully mature his spiritual powers and reach his own peak. It happened already during the tournament when a dire situation made Yusuke attempt Genkai's ultimate attack, the Spirit Wave (and he pulled it off, too). She really didn't want to enter. She'd been there once before, even won it back when she was partnered with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46049\" href=\"/toguro-ototo/4005-46049/\" slug=\"toguro-ototo\">  Toguro</a> (the same Toguro who practically forced Yusuke to enter the current tournament). The two of them have a history, which makes the last phase of the Dark Tournament all the more interesting.</p><p>Genkai will entrust Yusuke with the sum of her spiritual energy. From here out, Genkai will rely on what little energy she has left...as well as any she can tap from her opponents. Without the energy for her Spirit Wave techniques, she falls back on another batch of techniques known as Spirit Reflection, which rely on synchronizing with the enemy's spirit energy and tapping into it, using it against them. So even without the bulk of her power, she ensures Team Urameshi's entry into the finals, using Spirit Reflection to defeat Shishiwakamaru and good-old-fashioned martial arts to down Suzuka. But she knew that she wouldn't be in the finals herself. This is because she had to face the Younger Toguro, her close friend turned bitter enemy, before the finals began. And without her spirit energy, it was no contest. Yusuke tries to intervene, but is only there in time for Genkai to die in his arms.</p><p>But Genkai gets a new chance at life when Team Urameshi wins the Dark Tournament. They wish for Genkai to return to the world of the living. This will have a strange influence on Yusuke and company, however. Because with the upcoming Makai Tournament, Genkai will train a number of fighters from the Dark Tournament. They, in turn, will enter the Makai Tournament as rivals. <br/></p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>As Genkai herself puts it \"Ive put myself through hell to make my body strong enough to handle my Spirit Wave orb\" Genkai is a renouned human psychic and martial arts master. Her style called the Spirit Wave refers to two separate special moves and her personal hand to hand combat style. Even in her old age and without her orb she can hold her own with B-Class Demons as see when she battle Younger Toguro while he was using 80% of his power. Genkai has a profound understanding of how the Spirit World works and knows of demon world. conversely her name is known to almost every apparition and has been hunted for turning down a wish at the previous Dark Tournament.  <br/>Signiture Moves <br/>Kiai Cannon: Genkai summons an invisible barrier of spirit energy that sned sanybody she wants flying back with a lot of force. <br/>Spirit Gun: Like Yusuke, Genkai knows how to fire the Spirit Gun from her index finger by focusing her energy into the finger. <br/>Spirit Shotgun: Genkai taught this move to Yusuke, She charges her fist with spirit energy and fires a large number of small blasts with a large spread. Useful against multiple weak enemies. <br/>Spirit Wave Purification: A chanting move where Genkai stabs her energy into an opponent to cure them of various illnesses and possessions. This only works if the opponent is naturally good, if evil this move destroys them. <br/>Spirit Wave Orb: An orb comprised of Spirit energy compressed into the smallest space. Her training allowed her to create this and is the way she passes on her style by giving Yusuke this orb. <br/>Spirit Reflection Blasts: Genkai locks on to the spiritual wavelength of her opponent and steals a portion of that energy using it to fuel a blast. <br/>Spirit Cuffs: A training m,ove that makes the target need to use 100% muscle and 100% spirit energy all the time to even walk. Genkai used this on Yusuke to help him prepare for Younger Toguro. <br/>Spirit Healing: Genkai uses her energy to heal someone. This can even heal broken bones.  <br/>Paralyzing Touch: Genkai can paralyze an opponent with a simple touch. <br/>Spirit Barrier: Genkai can summon a barrier of energy to block attacks. <br/>Soul Return: Genkai can manipulate souls and return them to their original body. <br/>Spirit Wave: Genkai's signiture move where she uses her entire body as a focal point for her spirit energy. This causes her to revert to her 20 year old self as a side effect while she is fighting.<br/><p><br/></p>",

    "description": "<p>Naraku was a human thief named, Onigumo.  He was seriously burned and couldn't move.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46211\" href=\"/kikyo/4005-46211/\">  Kikyou</a> found him and took care of him.  He began to have twisted desires for her and wanted a new body.  So he offered his body to hundreds of demons to eat.  They all joined to become the new and improved Naraku.  After Naraku was born, he was jealous of Inuyasha and Kikyou's relationship.  He attacked Kikyou in Inuyasha likeness, leaving her with a fatal wound.  He then attacked <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45371\" href=\"/inuyasha/4005-45371/\"> Inuyasha</a> in Kikyou likeness.  His plan was to make Kikyou and Inuyasha believed that they were betrayed by the other, and to have Kikyou kills Inuyasha with her own hand.  He thought that Kikyou would then use the jewel to save herself.  Inuyasha will be out of the picture, and he will have both Kikyou and the jewel for himself.  Of course, things didn't go as he planned.  Kikyou chose to die and took the jewel with her.  That left him with nothing (poor Naraku).  50 years later, he found out that the jewel has returned, so he's now on a mission to get it again and making life a living hell for everybody else.  He later found out that the real Kikyou was brought back to life.  He loves her, he hates her, he's afraid of her spiritual powers.  He wanted to kill her, but couldn't hurt her because of his human heart (talk about a thin line between love and hate).  So he is searching for ways to get rid of his human heart and all that unnecessary feelings for Kikyou.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Kikyo was a priestess in charge of keeping the Shikon Jewel safe.  Meaning that she had to live a very solitary life.  When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45371\" href=\"/inuyasha/4005-45371/\" slug=\"inuyasha\">   Inuyasha</a> came to steal the jewel from her, she didn't kill him, just pinned him to a tree with her arrows.  He then followed her around, and the two begin to fall in love.  They planned to use the jewel to turn Inuyasha human.  The jewel will disappear and Kikyo will be free from protecting it.  Then she and Inuyasha could live together.  But thing didn't go as they planned, on her way to Inuyasha, Kikyo was attacked by \"Inuyasha\" and was seriously injured.  Inuyasha on the other hand, was attacked by \"Kikyo\", while he was waiting for her.  He thought she betrayed him, so he came to the village to steal to jewel.  He then ran into the real Kikyo.  She shot him in the heart with her arrow and sealed him off.  She died on the same day and her body was burned along with the Shikon Jewel.  50 years later, she was brought back to life by a demon who planned to use her to find the jewel shards. When Inuyasha saw her, he called out her named, forcing her soul out of Kagome's body and back into her.  She then attacked him out of anger that he had betrayed her.  After Kagome woke up, the soul escaped from  her body and back into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45492\" href=\"/kagome/4005-45492/\" slug=\"kagome\"> Kagome</a>. She got away with a little bit of her soul, and then fell over a cliff. At first, her plan was to take Inuyasha to hell with her, but after she found out the truth that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46210\" href=\"/naraku/4005-46210/\" slug=\"naraku\">  Naraku</a> was responsible for her death, her goal shifted toward destroying Naraku. Overall, she is still much in love with Inuyasha.</p><p>   After she sot the arrow that bound Inuyasha to the tree she asked her little sister to burn the shikon jewel with her so she knew it will never fall into the wrong hands again...or so she thought.<br/></p>",

Frank Blacksmith (An ex Gun turned Military commander) gave the order to hunt and arrest the guns. After Tom Noir's \"Death\" The remaining members decide it's time to act, they take to the street fighting both the Military and the elements that war cause. Later they return to their base, and they are attacked by Frank Blacksmith's new guns, who kill Dominic Hyde in the process.<br/><p>Kathryn is not well liked by the other members of her team.

As far as her powers go, there may be something feral about Kathryn Artemis. During her transformation, her eyes become red and catlike and her helmet takes on a wildcat shape. Her wildcat logo are on the front and back of her enhanced red and black motorcycle outfit. (Feral is listed in her powers for now but it is speculation at the point of Issue no. 2's publication.) As far as her other powers, there's no listing for \"super bike\" per se, but \"Gadgets\" is a broad category as is \"Implants\" so that seems like the best places to include her.</p><p>Her agility with the bike is impressive as she weaves through bullets or perhaps has a force field inherent in her gun enhancements. However when faced with having to defend herself against the US Armed Forces, her marksmanships takes out the entire platoon while she is not even scratched.</p><p>Kathryn Artemis' enhancement activation code word is: <b>Miyamoto</b>.</p>",

Dominic Hyde goes on Tv, to assure the media that John Horus and the Seven guns are not working together, however, A group of soldiers fire on Artemis, and she fired back slaughtering most of them, this prompts the air force to shoot at Angel One and Tom Noir, who just happen to be airborne, Activating her powers Angel destroyed the planes and the pilots with it causing a massive uproar in the media. When Angel and Tom reach the HQ, they all decide on whats the best plan of action, Tom goes off, appearing to surrender, but is fired on and \"Killed\". This enrages Dominic, who decides to take back their city fighting both the U.S and John Horus. Frank Blacksmith deploys his own Super enhanced team to raid an old Weapons dump that the guns had previously owned, and the two groups erupted in a fight, Dominic Hyde was killed leaving the three Woman: Angel One, Artemis and Zoe alive. In the end They find out that Tom killed Frank Blacksmith and John Horus.</p><p>Angel One's enhancements include more than a standard gun enhancement. In a flashback during Issue no. 2, Angela explains the implants called \"floaters\" which allow for her flight/levitation. The floaters are bound between the bone and muscle and are powered by the energy that her body produces naturally. The floaters work through a magnetic process creating a diamagnetic field and is stronger in places like cities where there is a lot of metal under the ground.</p><p>Angel One's gun activation code word is: <b>Daedalus</b>.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2> Jin the Wind master is one of the<a data-ref-id=\"4060-46237\" href=\"/team-masho/4060-46237/\" slug=\"team-masho\">         Shinobi Sect</a> members who operate in Demon World. The Shinobi Sect operates in complete secrey and their arts are taught from master to apprentice. Shinobi are expected to uphold their masters traditions though the current Shinobi, including Jin, long for the freedom of the open air in Human World. Of the members of the Sect Jin is good friends with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46229\" href=\"/toya/4005-46229/\" slug=\"toya\">         Toya </a>the Ice Master. Jin is considered the most powerful member overall being an upper C Class Demon though he left the actual strategy to team leader <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46236\" href=\"/risho/4005-46236/\" slug=\"risho\">       Risho</a>. Due to the teams desire for freedom they decided to break the Sects rules and enter the Dark Tournament. The prize being a wish from the winning team and the Shinobi's wanted Hanging Neck Island as a base of operations. <br/><h2>The Dark Tournament</h2>Team Masho, as the Shinobi Sect is called, enters the Dark Tournament with hopes of winning Hanging Neck Island itself as a safe haven. After winning their first match Team Masho went up against <a data-ref-id=\"4060-46145\" href=\"/team-urameshi/4060-46145/\" slug=\"team-urameshi\">      Team Urameshi</a>. Jin took point with Yusuke to determine the rules of the match, Jin suggested one on one fights till both teams were out of members. With that Jin then retreated to his own side and let his other teammates go first. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46230\" href=\"/gama/4005-46230/\" slug=\"gama\">     Gama </a>would lose to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45993\" href=\"/yoko-kurama/4005-45993/\" slug=\"yoko-kurama\">    Kurama</a>, and then Jin's friend Toya also lost to Kurama. After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46235\" href=\"/bakken/4005-46235/\" slug=\"bakken\">   Bakken </a>beatdown an unconscious Kurama causing Yusuke to kill him with some bone shattering punches, it was Jin's turn to fight. While Yusuke figured he needed his anger at Bakken as a motivation to beat down Jin, Jin joked around and got Yusuke in a good mood wanting a fare fight. Jin explained his mastery of Wind and the match was underway.. Jin immediately flew as high as he could to taken t]in the sights of the great open air.During the actual fight both Jin and Yusuke gave their all and at the end of the fight it was Yusuke's Spirit Wave vs Jin's Double Tornado Fist with the Spirit Wave sent Jin flying into the tournament stands. Jin then fainted losing the fight though he gained a friend in Yusuke. After his match Jin and Toya befriended Chu and Rinku from another Dark Tournament team that Team Urameshi defeated and gathered to watch Yusuke's fight with the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46049\" href=\"/toguro-ototo/4005-46049/\" slug=\"toguro-ototo\">  Younger Toguro</a>. Jin and the others aided the groups escape when the Dark Tournaments arena was set to self destruct by Sakyo. <br/><h2>Three Kings Saga</h2>After the Dark Tournament Jin and his new friends remained together as a group. They were approcehed bu Kurama to go through training under Genkai so they could serve as a special strike force for the one of the Demons Worlds three kings, Yomi. Genkai's training pushed Jin and his friends to low S-Class power levels. When Kurama presneted the group to Yomi that allowed him to become Yomi's second in command. Once Raizen, one of the three kings, died and his descendent Yusuke inherited the the kingdom. Yusuke went to Yomi's kingdom to discuss what to do Jin and the group were placed behind a fake wall to ambush Yusuke if he tried anything. Once Yusuke proposed the Makai Tournament, Jin, Kurama, and the others burst from the wall and offer to participate in the tournament. Jin then went on to train. Once the day had finally arrived Jin was able to get past the preliminary round though he would lose his first one on one match against Sogetsu, an old sparing partner of Raizen. After that Jin was seen cheering during Yusuke's match against Yomi. Once Yusuke lost the match and was hospitalized for a couple of days, Jin and the others were their to tell Yusuke what happened at the end of the Demon World tournament. Jin then went on to start training for the next tournament. He was seen gathered three years later along with the others ready to fight.<br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Jin is a master of the wind. He can use the wind to fly though an inherent weakness being a set speed at which he can move. Jin's trademarked move is his tornado fist where he can make a mini torando around his forearm that he uses to slam into the opponent. Jin is usually seen fighting close quarters atleast in his earlier appearences using his spped to dance around the opponent and flying away when it gets to dangerous. Jin can use a wall of wind as a defensive measure against projectile attacks. Later in his appearence Jin as learned atleast one long range attack allowing him to attack from a distance. <br/><b>Signature Moves <br/>Tornado Fist: </b>Jin twirls his arm around and summons a tornado around his forearm. This move is more powerful than it looks since even a glancing blow will send his opponent flying. <br/><b>Double Tornado Fist: </b>Jin twirls both arms and summons two tornadoes for twice the attack.  <br/>Tornado Raid: A video game exclusive attack where Jin shoots a miniature tornado as a projectile.<br/><b>Tornado Fist Explosion:</b> Jin summons his Tornado Fist but channels his demon engery into the wind allowing him to shoot the tornado. Their seems to be an electric component to this attack due to the crackling energy inside the tornado. <br/><b>Wind Barrier:</b> Jin summons a barrier of wind that can deflect projectiles attacks.",

    "deck": "The princess of Hyrule that Link always has to save from the Dark Lord Ganon. Zelda posesses one of the three pieces of the Triforce. The piece of Wisdom.",
    "description": "<h2>ABOUT THE CHARACTER</h2><p>The princess of Hyrule who happens to be a damsel in distress in most of the games except for Ocarina Of Time when she transforms in her alter ego Sheik, a surviving member of the Sheikah clan that looks like a boy, that helps out Link. Ganondorf who holds the piece of Power of the Triforce usually kidnaps Zelda to use for bait to get Link to come to the rescue so Ganondorf can get the other two pieces of the Triforce which would make him unstoppable. However, not everytime he kidnaps Zelda as her name means \"warrior princess\" so she usually fights back. Also if she is kidnapped she somehow gets a hold of Link and aids him throughout his journey.</p><p>What makes her stand out from the rest of Nintendo's princesses is that she takes her duty seriously and cares for her people as in Twilight Princess she even sacrificed her life to a being of the Twilight that was helping Link on his quest. Also In Wind Waker her alter ego Tetra is a pirate tomboy who sails the seas it's been hinted in this game that she's stronger than Link. In the upcoming Zelda game, Skyward Swords, instead of being a princess Zelda will be Link's childhood friend this role was originally played by Saria in Ocarina of Time.</p><h2>APPEARANCES</h2><p>The Legend Of Zelda: (NES, GCN, WII)</p><p>Zelda II The Adventure Of Link: (NES, GCN, WII)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past: (SNES, WII)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Links Awakening: (GB)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Ocarina Of Time: (N64, GCN, WII)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Majoras Mask: (N64, GCN, WII)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Orcale Of Seasons/Ages: (GBC)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda The Wind Waker: (GCN)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Four Swords: (GBA)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Four Swords Adventures: (GCN)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess: (GCN, WII)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Phantom Hourglass: (NDS)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Spirit Tracks: (NDS)</p><p>The Legend Of Zelda Skyward Swords: (WII)</p>",

It was during this meeting that Dark Beast witnessed Lewis displaying his \"mutant powers\". Lewis didn't in fact have mutant abilities, and some of his family (such as Melody and Jebediah) had actually lost their powers in the event known as M-Day, but Dark Beast saw potential in the youth and began experimenting on him. Dark Beast hoped to activate the latent X-Gene, which was surmised to be present in all of the Guthrie's. However, things did not go to plan and Lewis almost died as a result of the experiments - his body badly damaged. Lucinda Guthrie, his mother, discovered what had happened and shot at Dark Beast - chasing him from the premises.</p><p>Lewis Guthrie has not be seen since, but neither Paige or Sam have been shown to be mourning other than the loss of Joshua so it is safe to say that he survived the ordeal.</p>",

While fighting the war, a group of twelve superheroes, including Black Widow, formed when they entered a headquarters of the SS in Berlin. It was a random group with the heroes who were nearest to the building and wanted to check out if they could find anything inside the building to help the war effort. During their inspection of the building, the heroes were trapped by Nazis in a basement and put into cold sleep, for studying after the war. However, things turned out different than the Nazis had hoped. The Axis didn't win the war, and the secret basement was forgotten in time. Nothing was heard from the twelve heroes from that point on. On August the Second, 2008 the basement of the SS bunker was discovered during construction-works on the sight and the heroes were discovered to still be alive, frozen inside their tubes. The Pentagon brought them over to America and defrosted them, asking them to work for the government once again, openly this time as the <a href=\"../../super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Super-Human Registration Act</a> was in effect.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For every hero, it was a major adjustment to wake up 'in the future', more than 60 year after they where frozen. Most of the heroes stayed inside a mansion that had been payed for by the US government. Black Widow hoped that she was forgotten by Satan while she slept, but she was not. Soon she went for her nightly killing missions, bringing Satan the souls of evil men. During her free time, she found a goth bar, where she felt like she belonged somehow. She also revealed her history to <a href=\"../../phantom-reporter/29-46588/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Phantom Reporter</a>, who likes her, but needed to know whether she was good or evil. The two built up a strange but affectionate relationship.</p><figure style=\"width: 711px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2377121\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9774964838256\" data-width=\"711\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:197.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2377121\"><img alt=\"New Costume\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" data-width=\"323\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg 711w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg 485w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg 323w\"><noscript><img alt=\"New Costume\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg 711w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg 485w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/2377121-blackwidow55.jpg 323w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" data-width=\"323\"></noscript></a><figcaption>New Costume</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Not long after that, a disturbing phone-call came in; Black Widow's teammate Blue Blaze had been killed, and it seemed that the lifeless robot Electro was to blame for it. Electro however could only be controlled through a control panel, and nobody was at the panel at the moment that the robot killed Blue Blaze. Eventually, Phantom Reporter brought the remaining Twelve members together to expose the murderer. He revealed that Electro's control helmet revealed to him that Electro had been searching for contact while the twelve slept. It had made contact with the synthetic brain of Dynamic man. This enabled Dynamic Man to control Electro. Richard revealed that Dynamic man used Electro to murder several people including Blue Blade. Dynamic man snapped and destroyed the mansion the Twelve were staying in.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After their confrontation with <a href=\"/dynamic-man/4005-46577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46577\"> Dynamic Man</a>, whom was killed by the remaining members of the Twelve, Black Widow took off for a while to do work for her master.

Satan gave her the gift of immortality, essentially rendering her ageless. Her strength and endurance were increased and she gained the ability to fly, become invisible, alter her appearance and mentally plant suggestions into the minds of others. She was able to regenerate, as well as mystically heal others. She can independently transport herself to and from Hell.</p><h3>The Touch of Death</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Her signature was her most fearsome ability - the power to slay the living by touching their bare flesh. After she touched them, her victims died instantaneously and their souls were sent directly to Hell.

    "description": "<h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Risho was the team capatin for Team Masho during the Dark Tournament and during said tournament he seemed to be at least the second strongest. His high C-Class power gave him advantages over most demons though only meant he was slightly better than average. Risho was a trained demon Shinobi and learned a varitey to hand to hand combat tactics and had a great amount of experience. His trademark was he could control earth for variuos defensive purposes, creating armor from clay that also acted as a weapon. Risho was cold and calculating and would do anything to win.</p><p>Signature Moves</p><p><b>Armor of Clay:</b> Risho would summon a large amount of dirt and rock from the ground and wrap that around himself as an armor. This gave him an increase in defense as well as offense by weighing his blows and adding spikes to his forearms.</p><p><b>Armor of Clay 2:</b> An even thicker coat of armor desinged to be bashed into the opponent at high speed</p><p><b>Meteor Attack:</b> After coating himself with an armor Risho would jump into the air and charge himself with demon energy. Risho would then launch himself like a meteor at his opponent at highspeed doing a great amount of damage. The inherent weakness of this attack was that Risho had to get close to his opponent to smash into them.</p><p><b>Charging Tank: </b>Risho likes to get close in combat so he enhances his physical strength and charges, he only stops if he feels his armor can't withstand or do massive damage.</p><p><strong>Super Strength: </strong>50 tons</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>The Coyote Kid was a man with a love for causing pain wherever he went. He had four constant companions, the spirits of wind, fire, blood and death. His life consisted mostly of going into towns and shooting up everyone who gave him half a reason, but that all changed when he met Elizabeth. They married immediately and The Coyote Kid put up his guns, abandoned the spirits, and took up a life of farming his land and going to church with his wife and two kids. This went on for a few years until one night the zombies of all the men he'd killed came into his house and tied him and his family to a fence. They were lead by a man, or a demon in a man, and under his direction, they took one member of The Coyote Kid's family each night for three nights and ate them. On the third night, when he was all alone and tied to the fence, his spirit friends came back to him. They said they'd give him power and life for as long as he kept hate in his heart, and he said if that was the case, he'd live for eternity. He broke free of the fence, killed the zombies and buried his family. </p><p>He continued to search for the monster who caused his pain, killing any demon, creature or zombie he found along the way. He made Tranquility his home because he had heard that the man who had his family killed, The Host, liked it there, and The Coyote Kid wanted to meet him.</p><p>Eventually The Host returned and Coyote Kid, with a specially made holy bullet, tried to kill him. He failed and the host killed him instead. While the citizens of Tranquility battled The Host, Coyote Kid pleaded with the Sidewinder Spirits for more time and another chance to get revenge. They gave him 15 minutes of life, but that was enough. The Coyote Kid was able to kill The Host and then die himself. Upon his death, the spirits made Coyote one of them. He is now Pain and he'll ride with them forever.</p>",

    "deck": "Dosu was one of the three sound ninja that worked for Orochimaru and infiltrated the Chuunin exams.",
    "description": "<p>Dosu Kinuta was the leader of the Sound ninja team recruited by <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a> to test the power of Sasuke Uchiha, under the false guise of assassinating him. His introductory scene was when he, alongside his teammates Zaku Abumi and Kin Tsuchi, were pointed out by Kabuto as being from a village that had no background or importance in the Chuunin Exams. Hearing the statement, he took it as a direct insult to who he was and what he was doing. With Naruto shouting out that he would \"never lose to these idiots\", he ran forward and attacked Kabuto, proving that he was not someone to be messing with and that Sound ninja could be quite \"vicious\".</p><h2>The Strike</h2><p>Of course, it was later stated that even Kabuto, being the elite Sound nin that he was, was caught off guard by Dosu's attacks, and was unaware that they were actually willing to attack someone. He complimented Orochimaru for picking such willing subordinates for the job.</p><p>For years Dosu had seen <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a> as a father figure and friend, and he was the most powerful Sound genin. Dosu was initially unaware that <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a> had no intention of <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\">Sasuke</a> dying during the Chuunin Exams.</p><p>Dosu and his team ambushed Sakura and the unconscious <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\">Sasuke</a> and Naruto in the second test of the Exams: the Forest of Death. However, they are unable to achieve their goal of killing Sasuke, due to the interference of Rock Lee (who Dosu incapacitated quickly), Team Asuma, and the Cursed Seal-empowered Sasuke. In the process, Kin falls unconscious and Zaku's arms are broken by Sasuke. Dosu retreats and picks up his fallen teammates before conceding to Sasuke's powers and vowing that he wouldn't run next time. It is then that Dosu catches a whiff of Orochimaru's plan, realizing that he and his team were only meant to test Sasuke's abilities.</p><p>In the third round of the Exams, the tournament round, Dosu was put up against Choji. His opponent used the Body Expansion jutsu and charged after him, but Dosu dodged and guided him into the building's wall, where he knocked him out with the Melody Arm. He then proceeds to the Chuunin Exam finals with one goal in mind: to ruin Orochimaru's plans and kill Sasuke himself.</p><p>However, his desire to fight Sasuke overpowers his better judgment. In the month between the Exam tournament's preliminaries and its finals, Dosu attempts a preemptive strike on Sasuke's next opponent, <a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\">Gaara</a>. Dosu cockily challenges Gaara and is swiftly defeated by the inhuman power of the <a href=\"/shukaku/4005-50160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50160\">Shukaku</a>.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Dosu's face was never shown throughout the series because of his bandages. It is never stated whether or not the bandages meant anything to him, and why he wore them, much less why he covered one eye with them. He also wore a long fur scarf which gave him an awkward appearance due to its fuzzy outline. His posture was poor, and he was always hunched over in a primal stance, making him look even more awkward.</p><h2>Character Traits</h2><p>Kinuta's clan was never shown, and as far as we can discern, his eye color was black. He was covered up quite thoroughly as to make him seem more mysterious, maybe, or Masashi Kishimoto just wanted to try a new design. Dosu spoke softly, but when he did, he spoke with force behind his words. He never backed down from anything, other than Sasuke in his curse marked form, and that was only because he was worried about his teammates' safety. He was also clever and intelligent, as shown when he discovered one of Sakura's traps just from her throwing a kunai at a nearby squirrel.</p><p>Dosu stands out from Orochimaru's other minions in that he was one of the few that was able to see through Orochimaru's trickery. He was able to deduce Orochimaru's plans and realized that his team was expendable, which caused him to rebel.</p><p>Despite his harsh demeanor, Dosu was shown to have a protective attitude towards his teammates. He was always looking out for them, even though he had practically nothing in common with them. In the Forest of Death, he showed a fair amount of concern for his two teammates, and he was constantly warning them not to charge ahead recklessly (which they did anyway). He also checked in with his teammates and offered them advice before their respective rounds in the tournament. Later, when Zaku's arms were blown off by Shino, Dosu vowed that he would avenge his teammate and defeat Shino.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Dosu used the mechanism on his arm (the Melody Arm) as an amplifier to fight with, using his chakra to manipulate the sound waves at will. With this technique he was able to make a completely unblockable attack. He could use this sound to confuse and distort an enemy's senses, making it hard for the victim to balance, or even to destroy things (he used sound to destroy a log in the Forest of Death).</p><p>He also had superb hearing; he could detect what someone was writing just by listening to the scratches their pencil was making. He demonstrated this ability in the first round of the Chuunin exams.</p><p>He was skilled enough to be considered an \"elite rookie\" by Sasuke, who compared his power to that of Rock Lee, Neji, and Gaara.</p>",
