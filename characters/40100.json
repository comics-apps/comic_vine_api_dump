    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Owen Krysler was a mutant born in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mega-city-one/4020-55790/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55790\">Mega-City One</a> with the natural abilities of precognition, he was born with an odd eagle-shaped birthmark on his forehead.</p><p>At a young age his family moved out of the city into a settlement in the Cursed Earth. Four years after moving into the Cursed Earth the settlement where the Krysler family lived was attacked by slavers, both of the Judge Child's parents were killed in front of him and he was taken as a slave.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Judge Child was created by <a href=\"/john-wagner/4040-41829/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41829\">John Wagner</a>, <a href=\"/ron-smith/4040-52894/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-52894\">Ron Smith, </a>and <a href=\"/brian-bolland/4040-9976/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9976\">Brian Bolland</a>, with his first comic book appearance being in 2000AD #156 in 1980.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p><strong>The Judge Child Quest</strong></p><p>On his deathbed Judge Feyy, a well respected Precog of Mega-City One predicted that in 2120 a \"Judge Child\" would be destined to save the city from certain disaster. The child would be recognized by an Eagle shaped birthmark on his forehead.</p><p>Taking the prediction very seriously, Chief Judge Griffin ordered Dredd to find this \"Judge Child\", but by the time Dredd had tracked his location to a small settlement in the Cursed Earth, Owen Krysler had already been kidnapped by mutant slavers.</p><p>On the slave market the child was bought by the Filmore Fargo's Brotherhood of Trash (a cult which digs up discarded rubbish from the past - old cans/bottles etc, which are now worth a lot of money). He was supposed to die so that he could help the Brotherhoods leader, Fargo (a man who thought that he was a reincarnated Egyptian Pharaoh), into the afterlife.</p><p><a href=\"/judge-dredd/4005-30061/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30061\">Judge Dredd</a> managed to sneak into the Brotherhood camp as a slave, and almost saved Owen. But he had already been abducted by a member of the Brotherhood.</p><p>This member used the Judge Child for his owns ends, and sold his abilities as a fortune teller - predicting when people would die. Dredd tracked them down, but again was just a little too late, with the child being abducted by the <a href=\"/angel-gang/4060-58349/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58349\">Angel Gang</a> shortly earlier and taken off planet.</p><p>The Angel Gang wreaked carnage on the planet Xanadu, and the Judge Child told them that they would all die. When Dredd finally caught up with them, <a href=\"/pa-angel/4005-82661/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82661\">Pa</a> and <a href=\"/junior-angel/4005-7855/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7855\">Junior Angel</a> managed to escape with the Judge Child, heading to a place called Grunwald's Kingdom, a refuge for robots.</p><p>After a lengthy chase, Dredd caught up with the last surviving Angel gang members. Krysler watched while Dredd seemingly executed Junior, but saved Pa from Dredd so that he could kill him himself, breaking the ledge Pa was hanging from and sending him plummeting to his apparent death.</p><p>After finally reaching the end of his quest and looking into the Judge Child's eyes, Dredd could see only evil looking back at him. Based on intuition alone Dredd decided that the Premonition must have been flawed, and that a child such as Owen Krysler could only bring destruction to Mega-City One, not avert it.</p><p>In the end he decided to leave The Judge Child behind and return to Mega-City One alone. Whatever fate would befall the city in 2120, they would face it without him.</p><p><strong>Destiny's Angels</strong></p><p>After being left on Xanadu for some time the Judge Child, still angry for what Dredd has done to him decides to put into action a plan for revenge that he is certain cannot fail.</p><p>The first thing he decides to do is to free Fink Angel from his incarceration in Mega-City One, and then to raise Mean Machine Angel from his grave on Xanadu, using a potion of his own creation.</p><p>The Judge Child sends the two of them to kill Dredd, and after a short time they meet and decide to team up, first looking for Dredd at his apartment. Dredd being absent at the time, the two Angels decide to kidnap Maria, thinking her to be Dredd's wife, and smash up Walter when he tries to stop them.</p><p>Using Maria as bait to lead Dredd into a trap, the two Angels manage to catch Dredd, but after tricking Mean Machine to set him free Dredd succeeds in killing Fink, and subduing Mean Machine.</p><p>Knowing the Judge Child to be responsible, Dredd orders an attack on his location on Xanadu and the Judge Child is killed by a hail of missiles, the Grunwalder surmising that it wasn't the Judge Child's precognition that showed him his plan's success, but his own overwhelming hope to see Dredd die.</p><p><strong>City of the Damned</strong></p><p>After the Tek-Division create a time machine, Chief Judge McGruder, still wary of Feyy's catastrophic prediction decides to send Judge Dredd, and Judge Anderson into the future to have a look around and make sure that everything seems alright.</p><p>When arriving in the future it becomes clear to Dredd and Anderson that everything is <strong>not</strong> alright. Mega-City One is in ruins, the usually bustling streets are largely deserted, dead bodies can be seen on the ground, and groups of vampires rove the streets feeding on whoever they can find.</p><p>The vampire's Dredd comes across were all previously judges, and when visiting a sector house Dredd runs into a gang of Vampire Judges being led by a Vampiric Judge Hershey. Dredd and Anderson fight their way out of the Sector house and decide to search for answers.</p><p>By watching some historical tapes Dredd discovers that a malevolent being known only as \"The Mutant\" is responsible for Mega-City One's current state. The Creature is powerful, able to manipulate and change reality as it sees fit, the Judges are powerless to interfere, and the Mutant changes them all into frenzied, bloodsucking Vampires as he thinks it to be ironic.</p><p>The two Judges make their way to find the mutant, along the way they come across a group of monsters, and whilst escaping Dredd has both of his eyes gouged out, the two are then separated by a flood.</p><p>Dredd is spoken to by The Mutant using astral projection, and though blind he still decides to make his way towards the monster in the hopes of trying to kill it. When he reaches The Mutant it explains to him that it is, in fact the Judge Child.</p><p>After he was killed, the Grunwalder used some biological matter to clone the Judge Child, but something went wrong, creating a monstrous freak with enhanced Psi powers. Somehow the creature retained the memories and throughts of the Judge Child, so after growing it decided to resume its vendetta.</p><p>After explaining all of this the Judge Child reveals a zombie version of Dredd from his own timeline, and sends it after Dredd, giving him a head start. Dredd and Anderson run into each other whilst running from the Zombie, the two are heading away from the Time Machine, but it turns out that Dredd remembers the location of a teleporter. They use the teleporter to directly teleport into the Time Machine and The Judge Child doesn't have enough time to react before they use the Time Machine to escape.</p><p>Back in the present Dredd is fitted with some new, bionic eyes, and he and Anderson travel back to Xanadu and kill the Mutant before it has time to grow in power and threat.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>The Judge Child is an oracle and can not only predict the future, but also manipulate the turns of events however he sees fit. The Judge Child has also been shown to have other Psychic abilities, such as astral projection, and mind control that only works on the weak-willed. On top of his natural abilities the Judge Child is knowledgeable on other aspects of the occult, able to raise the dead back to life.</p><p>The Mutant is a very powerful reality changing entity, if he thinks something he can make it happen.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Quotes</h3><p>\"I saw a possible future and steered them into it. So what? they deserved to die\"</p><p>\"Curse You, Joe Dredd!\"</p><p>\"I am the Mutant, I am the Doom that was foretold\"</p><h3>Other Media</h3><p>In the 2012 movie, Dredd, there is a reference to the character in the form of a film poster for the fictional movie \"Krysler's Mark\", featuring a child as the central character.</p>",

    "description": "<p>X. Drake used to be a Rear Admiral for the <a href=\"/marines/4060-56572/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56572\"> Marines</a>, but quit because he wanted to be happy with his life. He became a freedom fighter, and gathered a crew of loyal men, calling them the Drake Pirates. He is calm and quiet compared to the other Supernovas, and tried to keep a low profile on Sabaody Archipelago. Drake uses his innate knowledge of the Marines to his advantage, which contributed to his massive bounty of 222,000,000.</p><p> </p><p>X. Drake is a thin but muscular man who has \"X\" markings on his chest and chin; they could either be scars or tattoos. He wars an open blue jacket, and a hat that looks like a raptors skull. He has rather thin arms and legs, which are usually covered in armor. He wears a copper belt buckle with a unique design on it.</p><p> </p><p>Due to the intensive training he underwent to become a Rear Admiral, Drake is very strong, wielding a four-headed axe with one arm. When trying to outrun the <a href=\"/shichibukai/4060-48019/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48019\"> Shichibukai</a>, he leaped over an eight foot tall man and got across a ten mile plain in a couple of minutes. When cornered, he was able to fight <a href=\"/bartholomew-kuma/4005-69027/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69027\"> Bartholomew Kuma</a>, the strongest of the Pacifista, as an equal for a few minutes.</p><p> </p><p>His fighting abilities are enhanced by what is called a rare, ancient, Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a massive dinosaur. In this form, he as able to bite off the head of a government cyborg. However, he was still vulnerable to his former boss, Kizaru's, light blast.</p>",

She was responsible for re-awakening Orion's warrior spirit as well as being involved in a short lived relationship with him after he was ressurected from a brief death and soul merger with the evil Desaad.",
    "description": "<br />Very little has been revealed about the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41471\" href=\"/new-genesis/4020-41471/\"><strong>New Genesis</strong> </a>warrior called Valkyra besides the facts that she is the mother of <strong><a data-ref-id=\"4005-37310\" href=\"/vykin-the-black/4005-37310/\">Vykin </a></strong>of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-25939\" href=\"/forever-people/4060-25939/\"><strong>the Forever People</strong> </a>and the former combat teacher of New Genesis' most formidiable warrior, <strong><a data-ref-id=\"4005-2363\" href=\"/orion/4005-2363/\">Orion</a></strong>. <br /> <br />Early on during Vykin's childhood he and his mother  along with four other young gods and their parents were called before <strong><a data-ref-id=\"4005-5324\" href=\"/highfather/4005-5324/\">Highfather</a></strong>, leader of the New Gods of New Genesis. The young gods and their parents were informed by Highfather that they had been chosen for a special purpose. Each child was given a special <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41473\" href=\"/mother-box/4055-41473/\"><strong>Mother Box</strong> </a>of which they were encouraged to bond with and return with it to Highfather in five years time. Being a warrior, Valkyra trained her son Vykin in combat techniques, but it seemed that the child developed more of a fondness for machines and electronics rather than combat possibly due to bonding with his Mother Box.  At the appointed five year time, Vykin and the other young gods return to meet with Highfather where they spend the next few years receiving special training from him. The things the young gods learned from Highfather lead to their developing a special bond and uniting as the team now known as the Forever People. The time away from with the Forever People plus Vykin's lack of interest in the ways of the warrior caused somewhat of an estrangement between Valkyra and her son. It was only  recently prior to the events of <a data-ref-id=\"4045-48489\" href=\"/death-of-the-new-gods/4045-48489/\">the Death of the New Gods</a>, that Valkyra and her son were reunited.  <br /> <br />Orion and<a data-ref-id=\"4005-4681\" href=\"/desaad/4005-4681/\"> Desaad </a>had manage to kill each other during a recent conflict and when Orion had been pulled back from<a data-ref-id=\"4015-48870\" href=\"/the-source/4015-48870/\"> the Source </a>by Highfather, it was unknowingly with the essence of Dessad within him and the process that lead to the explusion of Desaad from his body left him passive and contemplative. It was at <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21181\" href=\"/mark-moonrider/4005-21181/\">Mark Moonrider's </a>suggestion that Orion go to his old combat teacher, Valkyra, to try and rekindle his fierce warrior's nature. Once the Forever People and Orion reached Valkyra's home located on the southern pole of New Genesis, Valkyra decided a kind of \"shock therapy\" was in order and challenged Orion to combat in a gravity well in the hope that since Orion's mind remembered who and what kind of warrior he was, actual crisis style combat  would rekindle his warrior spirit.  Once they arrived at the combat arena and both donned their combat attire Valkyra unleashed brutal a no holds barred attack against Orion, which he intitially provide no counter attack or defense against. But as the fight progressed, slowly Orion's combat instincts began to kick in and he quickly counter attacked and soon started to gain the advantage over Valkyra. \"The Dog of War\" was back. The fight quickly end when Highfather appeared over the area and commanded they to stop due to his sensing through his link with the Source a threat to the Source and the universe itself.  <br /> <br />After the events of \"Genesis\", Valkyra was absorbed by a weapon left over from the time of the \"Old Gods\" and due to the timely actions of Orion she was freed from the weapon. It was then that both Valkyra and Orion professed to have feelings towards each other that they had developed centuries ago during the years that Valkyra spent training Orion but could not admit to or act upon due to their teacher/student relationship.  Sadly Valkyra and Orion's would only know happiness for a few short weeks. Due to circumstances put into motion by Orion's own mother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55609\" href=\"/tigra/4005-55609/\">Tigra</a>, in order to acheive what she hoped would eventually lead to the final destruction of Darkseid,Orion came into conflict with his half brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4680\" href=\"/kalibak/4005-4680/\">Kalibak </a>who had established himself as ruler of Apokolips in Darkseid's absence due to events that occured during \"Genesis\" that lead to Darkseid being imprisoned with in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42569\" href=\"/source-wall/4020-42569/\">the Source Wall</a>.  Orion sensing a tremor in the universe and guessing that his sibling may be about to do something of a destructive nature travels to Apokolips to confront Kalibak. Kalibak, using a cannon that in theory would be able to shatter the Source Wall thereby allowing him access to the power of the Source, but would also see Darkseid destroyed with the Source Wall, also used one of it's lesser funtions to tap into the power of Darkseid and gains the advantage in combat against Orion. Valkyra gaining insight of the future from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3616\" href=\"/metron/4005-3616/\">Metron</a> travels to Apokolips to the site where Orion and Kalibak engage in battle and witnesses the arrival of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10032\" href=\"/black-racer/4005-10032/\">Black Racer</a> coming to claim the soul of a defeated Orion, but before the Black Racer could reach Orion and claim him, Valkyra hurls herself into his path and sacrifices herself in Orion's place.",

He kept seeing her in his dreams and then discovers her at a party which was thrown by <a href=\"/julie-powers/4005-67141/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67141\">Julie Powers</a>, <a href=\"/stephen-stills/4005-66951/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66951\">Stephen Stills</a>' Girlfriend. He found out that she works for Amazon.ca and orders CDs off of Amazon to have her deliver them to him so they could talk, and eventually asked her out on a date, even though he was still dating <a href=\"/knives-chau/4005-67129/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67129\">Knives Chau</a> (17 years old). It is discovered that Ramona uses something called Subspace doorways to travel, and a convenient path is through Scott's mind, which is why she appears in his dreams.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After their date, in which Scott made out with her and slept in her bed but they did not have sex, Scott invites her to his band, <a href=\"/sex-bob-omb/4060-57618/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57618\">Sex Bob-omb</a>'s show. She appears at the show and watches as <a href=\"/matthew-patel/4005-67133/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67133\">Matthew Patel</a>, her First Evil Ex bursts through the ceiling and begins to engage Scott in a Street Fighter like battle in which Scott defeats Matthew. After the show, Scott and Ramona ride the subway and Scott asks her if they can date, although he is still dating Knives. She then informs him that if Scott wants to date her he has to defeat her seven evil ex's, which he agrees to do.</p><h2>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ramona and Scott are getting more comfortable with dating each other at this point. After Scott breaks up with Knives Chau, Ramona comes over to Scott and <a href=\"/wallace-wells/4005-67128/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67128\">Wallace Wells</a>' apartment to spend time with Scott. She is Back at Scott's place the day after, as she and Scott watch movies starring <a href=\"/lucas-lee/4005-67134/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67134\">Lucas Lee</a>, Ramona's second evil ex in order to study him, but this quickly becomes boring and they start making out and then fall asleep. The next day, Scott introduces Ramona to Sex Bob-omb and <a href=\"/young-neil/4005-67132/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67132\">Young Neil</a>, as they make Vegan Shepard's Pie.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After Scott has defeated Lucas, she walks into a Second Cup and runs into <a href=\"/stacey-pilgrim/4005-67144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67144\">Stacey Pilgrim</a>, Scott's sister who she previously met at Sex Bob-omb's show, and they go to the Toronto Reference Library, where Ramona has to deliver a package. Suddenly, Knives Chau appears out of nowhere and starts engaging Ramona in a fight because she is jealous of her. Ramona, who has no idea who Knives is, defends herself and fights back. She discovers that Knives used to date Scott from Stacey, and just as Ramona starts gaining the upper hand in the fight, Knives flees.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Later, while at a show featuring the band The Clash at Demonhead, of which Scott's ex girlfriend Envy Adams is the lead singer, it is revealed that Ramona's third evil ex, <a href=\"/todd-ingram/4005-67136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67136\">Todd Ingram</a>, is the bassist of the band.</p><h2>Scott Pilgrim and the Infinite Sadness</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ramona accompanies Scott and the rest of Sex Bob-Omb backstage to see Envy and Todd after the show so they can talk about Sex Bob-omb opening for The Clash at Demonhead at their next show. This quickly turns into a fight between Scott and Todd, which Todd wins easily using his Vegan powers. The two sides eventually agree to meet and fight at Honest Ed's the next day to resume the fight, and Ramona and Scott go back to Ramona's house to sleep. She accompanies Scott at the fight at Honest Ed's but no winner is decided as Todd cannot control his Vegan powers and causes Honest Ed's to implode. After this, we learn that Ramona and Todd dated when they were teens and Todd left Ramona to go to Vegan school, an when he came back, he flew up to the moon and flew into it, creating a crater in it to prove his love.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After she cuts Scott's hair, Ramona goes to see Sex Bob-omb open for The Clash at Demonhead. She then gets into a fight with Envy Adams, using a giant sledgehammer which is 2 against girls. Envy eventually gains the upper hand and is about to crush Ramona with her own hammer when Knives intervenes, claiming she only wants Scott to be happy. Eventually, Envy gets back on track with destroying Ramona, and Scott intervenes and pokes Envy in her weak spot, which is the back of her knee. Ramona then tells Envy that Todd is cheating on her with the drummer of The Clash at Demonhead, <a href=\"/lynette-guycott/4005-67145/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67145\">Lynette Guycott</a>, which Envy does not believe because Todd proved his love for her too, by creating a crater in the moon. Ramona tells Envy that Todd did this for her as well and they confront Todd, who is just exiting the restroom with Lynette with Lynette's panties on his head. This turns into a fight between Scott and Todd, and eventually, Scott wins when the Vegan Police take away Todd's powers for eating gelato.</p><h2>Scott Pilgrim Gets it Together</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ramona and Scott have been dating for a few months now, and we realize that Scott still doesn't know much about Ramona, other than the fact that she changes her hairstyle a lot and she is \"mysterious\". He doesn't even know her age, which upsets her a bit, and does not tell her. Later, Scott encounters a mysterious woman who engages him in battle, but disappears quickly after. He then sees the same woman having lunch with Ramona at The Happy Avacado, the restaurant Scott is working at. After a bit of confusion, it is discovered that Ramona and this girl, named <a href=\"/roxanne-richter/4005-67137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67137\">Roxanne Richter</a>, used to date during college, during Ramona's \"sexy phase\" which makes her Ramona's fourth evil ex. Scott, who is not ready to fight a girl yet hides in Ramona's Subspace purse while Ramona engages Roxy in battle, using a titanium baseball bat which is 1 against blonds. They make their way to a Subspace door and start to battle in there, where Roxy quickly gains the upper hand and leaves.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ramona then gets upset at Scott because she thinks that Scott has a thing for Lisa Miller, Scott's old friend from high school who is in town visiting. The day after, Scott is being chased by the mysterious man from before, who turns out to be Knives Dad, and runs to Ramona's place using Subspace, and goes through Ramona's dream. She gets upset at him and is even more upset when she discovers that Scott stayed a Lisa's house the night before, thinking she is losing Scott. Just then, Roxy appears in the doorway and it is discovered that Roxy spent the night at Ramona's. Knives dad eventually catches up with Scott and starts engaging Roxy in battle, but both have no idea what is going on. Scott finally mans up and tells Ramona that he loves her, and with that gains 9999 EXP. and earns a sword, which he uses o defeat Roxy. Knives dad leaves, knowing Scott never hurt Knives. The issue ends with Scott moving into Ramona's house because his lease with Wallace is up, and Ramona finally telling Scott what her age is, which is 24.</p><h2>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The Universe</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Scott and Ramona are at one of Julie's parties, when they run into Ramona's fifth and sixth evil exes, <a href=\"/ken-katayanagi/4005-67139/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67139\">Ken</a> and <a href=\"/kyle-katayanagi/4005-67138/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67138\">Kyle Katayanagi</a>, twins that Ramona dated at the same time. Scott fights one of their robots while Ramona talks with <a href=\"/kim-pine/4005-67130/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67130\">Kim Pine</a> on the balcony. Later, it is revealed that Ramona doesn't really like Sex Bob-omb's music, and Scott is freaked out by it. Later, at Sex Bob-omb's show, Knives confronts Ramona in the ladies room and they fight, where Knives tells Ramona that Scott cheated on both of them with each other.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They go to another one of Julie's Parties and Scott, Ramona and Kim get wasted on Jose Cuervo and then they leave. Later, in bed, Ramona confronts Scott about what Knives said, and Scott tells her that he never cheated on her, but he cheated on Knives with her. They argue and eventually fall asleep. After Scott rescues Kim from the twins and defeats them, he comes back to the house and Ramona thanks Scott for the time they had together and then disappears.</p><h2>Personality and Traits</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ramona is a mysterious figure for most of the series, and not much is known about her past. She sometimes gets jealous of other women who are close to Scott and when she is angry or upset, her head glows and this glow is visible to everyone. She quit smoking after college, but in the fifth volume she is seen to be smoking quite frequently, which could be due to the fact that that she seems more dark and brooding in the volume. She is shown to be good friends with Kim Pine, and seems to truly love Scott.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Movie -</b> In the movie Ramona Flowers is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game -</b> Ramona Flowers appears as one of the four initial playable characters alongside her boyfriend Scott, <a href=\"/stephen-stills/4005-66951/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66951\">Stephen Stills</a> and Kim Pine. Her moves usually revolve around her Subspace Suitcase or her hammer. Ramona has a unique skill where she can pull various items from her suitcase.

    "deck": "Knives Chau dated Scott Pilgrim for a short time before he met Ramona Flowers. 17 years old and a self proclaimed \"Scottaholic\", Knives attempts to win Scott back by becoming more of a hipster.",
    "description": "<p><strong>Precious little life</strong></p><p>Knives met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41186\" href=\"/scott-pilgrim/4005-41186/\">Scott</a> on the bus with her mom and decided they dated after that. Usually she would talk about high school drama and other stuff with Scott. When she first heard Sex Bob-omb she immediately fell in love with the band. Knives then started dressing like a hipster and had her first kiss with Scott. On the night of Scott's performance Knives passed out due to excitement.</p><h3>Vs the world</h3><p>When Knives was on a date with Scott at a CD store, Knives confesses her love to Scott but Scott broke up with Knives ( <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67128\" href=\"/wallace-wells/4005-67128/\">Wallace</a> made him do it). Knives then goes into a depression and stalks Scott and learns that he's dating Ramona. Furious she invites her friend over to help highlight her hair and talks mean things about Ramona. Later while Ramona was delivering a package to a library, Knives attacks her with 2 knives as weapons. Ramona fought back and ended when Knives realized that she saw Ramona at a library and realized that Scott cheated on her with Ramona so she left. She was then seen later at the Clash at the Demonhead (her favorite band) concert while on a date with Young Neil. Knives then learned about how Scott used to date Envy Adams (lead singer) which made her go crazy.</p><h3>The infinite sadness</h3><p>After the show. The whole group were backstage talking with Envy and the band. Knives kept interrupting Envy saying how much of a fan she is but was responded with the drummer punching the highlights out of her hair and kicked out. She was seen later crying outside while being comforted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67132\" href=\"/young-neil/4005-67132/\">Young Neil</a>. On the day Sex Bob-omb was to perform she was sitting in an ally way depressed. Scott came and tried to cheer her up. Knives then revealed that she only dated Young Neil because he sort of looked like Scott. Scott then cheered Knives up and Knives said she still loved him. Later when Ramona was fighting Envy, Knives came and sneak attacked <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67131\" href=\"/envy-adams/4005-67131/\">Envy</a> but also hit a wall leaving her unconscious.</p><h3>Gets it together</h3><p>Knives is seen at <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67141\" href=\"/julie-powers/4005-67141/\">Julie's</a> birthday party at her aunt's beach house and knives broke up with Young Neil. Later Scott found Knives drunk and making out with drunk <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67130\" href=\"/kim-pine/4005-67130/\">Kim</a>. After the party, Knives is at her home taking about how much she doesn't like Young Neil and wonders why a picture of Scott is slashed. Knives is later seen working at the Coffee bean and tells Scott the mysterious man who is trying to kill Scott is actually Knives's father who wants him dead after he figured out he was dating Knives. After that she was seen drunk at a party.</p><h3>Vs the universe</h3><p>Knives was then at one of Julie's parties talking to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-66951\" href=\"/stephen-stills/4005-66951/\">Stephen Stills</a>. Stephen told her about how he was dating Knives and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67127\" href=\"/ramona-flowers/4005-67127/\">Ramona</a> at the same time which made Knives wonder if Ramona knew she was cheated on. During Scott's fight with the second robot, Knives was fighting Ramona and revealed that Scott was 2 timing them both and left.</p><h3>Finest hour</h3><p>Knives is now 18 was talking to Scott at a party. After Scott asks if Knives wants casual sex she says that she is now over Scott but still loves him. She then says she wants to be alone and wants to find herself. Knives and Scott then briefly made out but ended awkward. Later she is seen at the new Chaos theater with her friend who is now a major Envy Adams fan. After the fight Knives is heading off to college and tells Scott that he will always be her Clash at the Demonhead and leaves.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Movie -</b> In the movie Knives Chau is played by Ellen Wong.</p><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game -</b> Knives was originally a stryker that and of the four playable characters could summon each with a different effect. Scott would summon Knives who would then sprout the word \"LOVE\" in big puffy letters that stuns enemies. Ramona summons Knives who is holding a giant teacup. Stephen Stills summons Knives who then throws large daggers across the screen. Kim summons Knives who proceeds tp kiss he for a quick health boost and a stun effect by freaking out the enemies on screen. Negascott ,instead of summoning Knives, summons Negaknives. She was added as a DLC character and now has her own storymode adn her mother Mrs. Chau as her stryker. Her ending depicts her and Scott's wedding. She appears in Scott's ending as his one of three girlfriends after Ramona leaves him alongside Envy Adams and Kim Pine. In Kim Pine's ending her and Kim become a couple to the bewilderment of Stephen and Scott. In Negascott's ending Knives along with the rest of the main cast become slaves.</p>",

    "deck": "A high school friend of Scott Pilgrim and drummer of his band Sex Bob-omb. Kim is very sarcastic and often seems annoyed by Scott.",
    "description": "<h2>So Far in Scott Pilgrim</h2><p>Kim can be described as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41186\" href=\"/scott-pilgrim/4005-41186/\" slug=\"scott-pilgrim\">Scott Pilgrim's</a> first girlfriend who he saved from Simon Lee during high school. The relationship between her and Scott ended when he and his family moved to Toronto. Since, she moved to Toronto and meet up with a much changed Scott and became the drummer of his new band Sex Bob-omb (she was the drummer of his band back in high school <i>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</i>). She is employed at the No-Account video and became a room mate to her co-worker Hollie, which ended when in Vol. 5 she revealed to Scott that she was moving back up Northern Ontario. When she departed she hardly confirmed if she were to come back, he ambiguously apologized for his actions.</p><h2>Relationships</h2><p>Kim is always annoyed at Scott's actions and when someone talks about his previous/ current girlfriend she seems uncomfortable (Neil, and Stephen brought up Envy on some accounts wear she shrunk back and remarked on how pretty she was or when Ramona mentioned her she told her she was the cause of his change, also when bringing up Knives she would bring up a sarcastic remark about how brief the relationship between Scott and her.). She herself revealed to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67127\" href=\"/ramona-flowers/4005-67127/\" slug=\"ramona-flowers\">Ramona Flowers</a> that she does not like to disclose to people that she and Scott had previously dated. Also, it was seen in a dream sequence (which she may have often) that Simon Lee had killed Scott and at his funeral where (it can be assumed) all his past girlfriends were present. She had also had a relationship with a friend named Jason Kim (Scott finds it humorous-Jason Kim &amp; Kim Pine- several times). In addition, while celebrating Julie Powers birthday Scott found a drunk Kim and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67129\" href=\"/knives-chau/4005-67129/\" slug=\"knives-chau\">Knives</a> making out- though it does not seem that she is in fact lesbian contrary to Scott's thinking. It should be noted she shows a strong disliking for many people especially her old room mates.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Movie -</b> In the movie Kim Pine is played by Alison Pill. Kim Pine has a relatively minor role in the movie only being involved in the band parts of the story or where a snide remark is needed. When Sex Bob-Omb is scouted by G-Man (Gideon), Kim signs the band up along with Stephen Stills and Young Neil replacing Scott. They end up playing the Chaos Theatre when Scott breaks in the defeat Gideon. The first run down the band has no real opinion about the fight since they have sold out, but after Scott's extra life run through the band cheers him on with the song which Kim starts by saying \"WE ARE SEX BOB-BOMB AND WERE HERE TO WATCH SCOTT PILGRIM KICK YOUR TEETH IN. ONE, TWO THREE, FOUR.\"</p><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game -</b> Kim Pine is one of the four initial playable characters in the game. Her assist with Knives has Knives come out to kiss Kim to regain some health and freak out the enemies on screen. Kim exists levels via a a smiling star in a nod to the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57738\" href=\"/kirby/4005-57738/\" slug=\"kirby\">Kirby</a> games.Her ending depicts her getting into a relationship with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67129\" href=\"/knives-chau/4005-67129/\" slug=\"knives-chau\">Knives Chau</a> to the bewilderment of Scott and Stephen. In Scotts ending Kim becomes Scott's girlfriend along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67131\" href=\"/envy-adams/4005-67131/\" slug=\"envy-adams\">Envy Adams</a> and Knives Chau once Ramona dumps him. In Stephen Stills ending Kim and the rest of the band hit it big though this is implied to be a dream. In Negascott's ending Kim becomes a slave alongside the rest of the cast to Negascott. In Knives ending she is one of the spectators to Knives' and Scott's wedding.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Envy first appears at the end of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and is then in Scott Pilgrim &amp; the Infinite Sadness and in Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour.</p><p>Envy's real name is Natalie V. Adams and had a some what bad childhood. She was friends with Todd Ingram since she was 11 but Todd moved. In college she was roomates with Julie and in a relationship with Scott Pilgrim. She was also vocals in Scott's and Stephen Stills's band Kid Chameleon. She was known as the nerdy anime chick until she sold all her stuff and used them to buy better clothes. The band she was in got bigger and more popular. She kicked Scott off of drums and onto bass. She then left to Montreal to visit todd and they had an affair. When she returned the band (now hers) got a record deal and left Scott for Todd. After she graduated she started the band Clash at the Demonhead which became really popular.</p><p><strong>Vs the world</strong></p><p>Envy first appeared through a phone call to Scott. She called to talk to him and told him that her and the band are performing in Toronto and Want Scott's band to perform as an opening band. The phone call left Scott in a coma. Later at the end of the book Envy came and performed at Lee's Palace.</p><p><strong>The infinite sadness</strong></p><p>After the show she had Scott and the gang come backstage to chat. Envy talked to Julie and Ramona acting high and mighty. Knives (being the huge fan she is) kept interupting her. So Envy signaled Lynette Guycott to punch Knives and kick her out. Then Scott leaped and attacked Todd but Todd beat Scott in the end. Envy then stopped the fight and postponed it until the next day at Honest Eds. The next day she explained the challenge of going in Honest Eds, head to the back, and fight each other. She also told Todd to not use his powers. The challenge then ended with todd destroying the place with his powers and she postponed the fight again. The day Scott's band is to perform she asks scott for a chat but didn't work out. Then she went to Ramona and messed around with her and says she knows all about her and Gideon. Ramona responds by calling Envy by her real name and they broke out into a fight. Envy fought but was distracted by Wallace's insults leaving Ramona with the upper hand until Wallace went to the bathroom. Envy then gained the upper hand and was going to squish Ramona with her own hammer until Knives came and attacked her but that failed. Then Scott came stopped Envy by poking the back of her knee which was her pleasure spot making her fall down. She then was going to attack Scott until Ramona revealed that Todd is cheating on her with the drummer. Envy refused to believe it because she thinks Todd loves her so much he blasted a hole threw the moon. Ramona then told her Todd did the same thing for her. Envy then found Todd with the drummer's underwear on his head which made her furious. She attacked Todd and kicked him in the balls. Todd responded with a punch and knocked Envy down. Scott came and defeated Todd. Envy now depressed says she forgives Scott and leaves without giving Scott closure.</p><p><strong>Finest hour</strong></p><p>Months later, Envy has become a solo artist and is currently dating Gideon. She had coffee with Scott and told Scott that they broke up because of an argument Scott started. Later she is seen performing her new solo album at the new Chaos Theatre owned by Gideon. When Scott defeated Gideon she finally gave him closure by hugging him. She then said her relationship with Gideon wouldn't last and left.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Movie -</b> In the movie Envy Adams is played by Brie Larson.</p><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game -</b> Envy appears as a mid-boss during World 3 alongside <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67145\" href=\"/lynette-guycott/4005-67145/\">Lynette Guycott</a> for the party. The pair take turns during the fight with Envy using basic kicks and a homing jump kick while taunting Lynette to do most of the fighting. Once they are defeated that triggers a cutscene where Lynette and Envy brawl (probably about Todd cheating on Envy with Lynette) and Lynette loses her bionic arm as she telports away. Envy then disappears with a cloud hanging over her head and leaves $2.60 for the player. Envy appears in Scott's ending, after Ramona dumps Scott he begins dating his 3 ex girlfriends at the same time.

    "description": "<p>Patel apears in Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life.</p><p>Mathew was the only non white non jock in middle school and also had mystical poweres. Ramona Flowers and Mathew teamed up and took out the whole football team and kissed once. Ramona dumped him a few weeks later. He didn't become really evil until high school.</p><p>In Precious little life Mathew sent Scott a email talking about the league and a fight they will have soon but Scott deleted it. Mathew then sent a letter to Scott but he tossed it. On the day of the concert Mathew broke in while Sex bob-omb was performing and attacked Scott Pilgrim. Scott countered and did a 67 hit combo on Mathew. Mathew then summoned demon hipster chicks and fought Scott. Scott and friends teamed up and destroyed the hipster chicks and Scott defeated Mathew. Mathew turned into a handful of coins.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Movie -</b> In the movie Matthew Patel is played by Satya Bhabha.</p><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game -</b> Matthew Patel appears as the first world boss in the game just like the comic book and movie. Compared to the rest of the games bosses he is realtivly easy to defeat. This may be intentional as most 1st level bosses are easy and the game has many video game and anime references. He attacks with standard melee and weak fireball attacks. Once he has taken enough damage he will summon the demon hipster chicks and encase himself in an energy pillar. Once the demons are defeated the fight will resume. Once he is low on health Matthew will summon two more Demon Hipster Chicks who will continually teleport while shooting fireballs in a last bid to defeat the players. Once defeated the players receive $2.10 just like in the comic book.</p>",

He came to Toronto to film another movie. When Scott came to face him, Lucas punched Scott and threw him into a church. They then took a break, Lucas told Scott about his relationship with Ramona. Lucas Lee Dated Ramona in High school. Based on Ramona's description of him in high school he was a greasy haired dork skater who had drama or math class with her. Lucas begged Ramona to date him. Eventually she gave in. They spent most of the time smoking. Ramona eventually left him for Todd Ingram. Lucas then said he would take a bribe but Scott rejected and instead dared Lucas to grind down a long stairway with a skateboard. Lucas took the challenge, he started off easy but he kept picking up more speed untlil he was going too fast to live and was defeated and Scott won by default. Scott earned Lucus's skateboard but it disapeared because Scott couldn't use it.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Movie -</b> In the movie Lucas Lee is played by Chris Evans.</p><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game -</b> Lucas Lee appears as the second world boss right in line with the comic book. The movie set level has the players maneuvering through sets inspired by Aliens, Indiana Jones, Godzilla and others. Once players reach Lucas he simply uses his fist or rides a skateboard dropped by his minions for attack. Once he is defeated Lucas will perform the rail grind that kills him though the rail is much shorter so it makes the scene more humiliating for a pro skater. Lucas does drop the Mithril Skateboard though it cannot be picked up.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>The infinite sadness</strong></p><p>Todd went to the same high school as Ramona and Ramona left Lucas Lee for Todd. They both dated and did bad things until Todd left to become a vegan. He returned and showed Ramona his love by making a hole in the moon. Then Todd left for Vegan academy. Todd then went out with Envy Adams who was his childhood friend and she was so in love with him that she cheated on Scott with him. Envy then left Scott for Todd and they formed the band Clash at the Demonhead as bass which became extremely popular. In the present, the band came to Toronto to place at Lee's palace and to fight Scottt Pilgrim. After the bands first show they all meet up with Sex bob-omb, Julie, Young Neil, and Knives. After hours of Envy talking, Scott finally leaped at Todd but Todd used his vegan powers to throw Scott threw a wall and into a dumpster. Scott tried fighting but Todd's powers were to good. Envy then said they will finish tomorrow at Honest Eds at 1 Pm. When the day came, Todd and scott's objectives were to go into Honest Eds, go to the back of the store, and fight each other until one of them wins. Todd was also told to not use his powers as a handicap for Scott. They then entered and were being terrorized by the low prices. They finally reached the back and Todd made a gun out of household appliances, but the store was too good for him and ended up using his powers to destroy the store. It ended in a tie. Later on the day of Clash of the Demonhead's last show in Toronto. The band was eating in a restaurant and Todd was breaking Vegan rules by eating gelato but justified himself saying \"I''m a rockstar I can do anything\". It also shows that he's having an affair with the bands drummer Lynette Guycott. On the night of the show, Todd is making out with Lynette while Envy is fighting Ramona. Todd finally came out of the bathroom with Lynette's underwear on his head and Envy found out and became very furious. Envy ripped of Lynette's bionic arm and tried hitting Todd with Ramona's hammer. Todd catches the hammer with his powers and tries to calm her down by telling her he loves her and wouldn't hurt her. Envy replies with a kick in the balls which made Todd angry and punched Envy. Scott came and fought Todd, Scott and Todd then had a bass fight but Todd won because he actually knows how to play the bass. Then Crash and the boys come out and create a barrier to protect Scott and give him a chance to land a blow on Todd. Todd then caught Scotts blow and threw against a counter. Then out of nowhere the vegan police showed up and removed Todd's powers because he ate gelato and chicken parmasean. Powerless, Scott then headbutted Todd defeated him. Todd turned into coins and an extra life.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Movie -</b> In the movie Todd Ingram is played by Brandon Routh.</p><p><b>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game -</b> Todd Ingram appears as the fourth world boss in line with his appearance on the comics.

    "description": "<p><strong> <br />Infinite Sadness </strong></p> <p>The first time we see Gideon is when Scott and Todd are racing threw Honest Eds and was inside his mind telling him to use his phsycic powers to destroy the store. Then at the end while Scott's band was performing, Gideon was being interviewed for the documentary of Clash at the Demonhead but he only said \"no comment\" and walked away.  <br /> <br />Other times he was seen in blurry images Wallace showed Scott. <br /> <br /><strong>Finest Hour <br /></strong>Gideon is revealed to be a music producer and night club owner of the chaos theatre. It was also shown that he is currently dating Envy Adams. Later he's shown prepping of the grand opening of the Chaos Theatre for Toronto and Envy Adams solo record. He seems controlling and not caring of everyone else but himself. Later on the grand opening, Gideon sneak attacked Scott but Scott dodged. Gideon then realized that Scott and Ramona weren't dating anymore which made Gideon angry. He then stole the power of love sword, leveling down Scott. He then asked Scott to join the leauge of evil ex's but Scott refused. Gideon then stabbed Scott with the sword killing him. Then Scott came back to life with the extra life he got from Todd Ingram and Ramona joined Scott. Gideon then revealed his plan of putting Ramona in a cryo chamber of Gideon's past girlfriends. Also he revealed he started the Leauge because he got drunk and put a drunken rant on craigslist. He then talked about the glow and how it traps the person inside their mind. Scott and Gideon fought some more and Ramona then decided to use the glow to disappear into subspace but Gideon stabbed her with the sword. Scott then went into Ramona's subspace bag to get inside Ramona's head. Gideon had control over Ramona's head and turned into a giant demon looking monster but turned back into its original form after Scott headbutt Gideon with the glow. Gideon revealed that the glow has no affect on him and cuts Scott diagonaly. Ramona then kicked Gideon out of her head. Back in the real world, Gideon revealed that he has been in both Scott and Ramona's head a lot using the Subspace highway and messed with Scott's memories. Scott gained the power of understanding sword after seeing Gideon snapping at Envy. Ramona also had the power of love sword, so gideon took a sword out of Envy's dress and fought Scott and Ramona. Gideon was defeated and turned into 77,777,777 coins. <br /></p> <h2>Scott Pilgrim Vs.

The pair take turns during the fight with Lynette using her bionic arm for quick punches, long range extendo punches, and by punching through the ground. Once they are defeated that triggers a cutscene where Lynette and Envy brawl (probably about Todd cheating on Envy with Lynette) and Lynette loses her bionic arm as she telports away.

    "deck": "Replicus is the common name for two supposedly identical robots, created by Chuda. They were enemies of Thor. ",
    "description": "<p>The original Replicus was created by Chuda, a humanoid alien scientist. (Chuda was depicted as a rather typical middle-aged, Caucasian male). It had superhuman strength, able to lift at least 75 tons, and was durability. It had speed and durability allowing it to dodge <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\" href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" slug=\"mjolnir\">       Mjolnir</a> when the latter was thrown against it at high speeds. Its fingers produced great heat. Cobalt cables extended from its hands, allowing it to ensnare enemies. Its forehead contained a weapon able to fire powerful blasts. Its one major weakness was its dependence on external power sources. If his supply was cut off, Replicus would collapse to an inert state. <br/> <br/>In \"<a data-ref-id=\"4050-2294\" href=\"/thor/4050-2294/\" slug=\"thor\">      Thor</a>\" vol. 1 #141 (June, 1967), Replicus was introduced as a prototype for an intended army. Chuda intended to create others and spread chaos in the United States. Eventually thousands of Replicus models would conquer Earth for his (unnamed) superiors. But first a test-run was needed. Chuda sold the original Replicus to \"Slugger\" Sykes, a gang leader. It managed to single-handedly perform a bank robbery. Sykes then had it throw out his previous henchmen, deciding their services were no longer needed. <br/> <br/>Replicus performed a crime spree around New York, evading police efforts to stop it. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" slug=\"thor\">     Thor</a> eventually appeared to fight the robot. But it managed to hold its own in the battle. However by this point Sykes learned of Chuda's real plans. The two villains fought each other and crushed into the devices feeding Replicus with energy. They were instantly killed and Replicus was left inert. <br/> <br/>In \"Thor\" vol. 2 #9 (March, 1999), a nephew of Sykes managed to use another extant version of Replicus in a new crime-spree. While it was again invulnerable to police attacks, Thor proved much more effective against it. He demolished the robot with his fists. Then he tracked down and arrested the younger Sykes. Thor commented on no longer holding back in battle even in the presence of mortals. But the second Replicus appeared a mere shadow of its predecessor. <br/></p><h2>Creation<br/></h2>Replicus was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\" href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" slug=\"stan-lee\">   Stan Lee</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\" href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" slug=\"jack-kirby\">  Jack Kirby</a> in 1967 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2294\" href=\"/thor/4050-2294/\" slug=\"thor\"> Thor</a> # 141.",

    "description": "<h2>Appearance</h2><p>Kratos is a hulking and fierce looking warrior. He is mostly seen without a top and with his signature chain swords. His unusual white complexion is the result of a curse an oracle put on him, the ashes of his deceased daughter and wife are affixed to his skin. He also has a scar on his left eye that Ares gave him and a massive one in his chest which his father zeus gave him. He wears sandals and later changes to Hermes' boots for a better advantage in fighting his enemies.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p><b><i>\"Death is my calling. Vengeance my creed.

He will kill anyone who enters his path or need to move on, he has no qualms to sacrifice even innocent mortal to reach his goals. Kratos is not someone to hold a grudge with, as with gods such Ares or Zeus in particular, the latter for making him a monster and brutally murdering his wife and his daughter, and the former for betraying him after he became the new God of War.</p><p>He is not without positive traits: he shows sorrow for having killed his mortal family and is haunted by the memories of it, but frequently turn his angst into anger and hatred for those who directed him to do it. After killing Ares, he discovers that though his sins may have been forgiven he was not eased from the visions that came to haunt him and considered suicide to escape his madness, but as reward from the gods, he ascended as the new God of War, and proved to be more dangerous than Ares himself. The the pain of his memories were turned into hatred because he never asked to become a God. After being betrayed, Kratos desired to destroy Zeus and everything he stood for if any would interfere on Zeus' behalf.</p><p>Despite his thirst for revenge, the only people he truly cared about were his <i>mortal</i> family: his wife, daughter, mother, and brother. As a child, he was very close to his younger brother and once inseparable but the weaker children like Kratos' brother had been cast into the wilderness without a chance to survive. As an adult, he had many women, but he felt truly connected to one who would become his wife, she was perhaps the only person to truly face him without fear. His daughter Caliope also meant a great deal to him as he was willing to renounce his powers to stay in the Underworld with her. Kratos also cared for his mother and had to kill her when Zeus turned her into a monster. The loss of everyone he ever loved fueled an even greater need for revenge to take everything from those who took his life from him: Zeus and the Gods. Also when Kratos encounters his half-siblings it shows that he doesn't want to fight them and just stay out of his way, but will fight and kill them if they force him.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Kratos is the son of Zeus and Callisto. Kratos also has a younger brother named Deimos, Deimos was scarred by his broken house and was captured by Ares. Kratos got a red mark symbolizing Deimos' scar. When the rumors about his sire's identity grew so strong, his mother took Kratos to Sparta and receive training. He quickly become a Spartan general and although his tactics were brutal, they were efficient. But soon he learned that despite all his military power he was no match for Eastern Barbarians, numbered in the thousands, and his men fell one by one. As he was ready to be finished by the Barbarian King, Kratos pledged Ares the God of War and the Furies to save him,and kill his enemies. Kratos exchanged his soul for a victory. There are three blood oaths: the death of his enemy, the death of his enemies and the death of his brethren. Kratos became a living weapon, his swords attached to chains and burned to his forearms. He continued in the ways of war and death for Ares. But Ares deceived Kratos, and in his bloodlust Kratos killed Lysandra and Calliope. He was then cursed by a woman of the village, the ashes of his family forever turning his skin pale.</p><h3>God of War: Ascension</h3><p>The Furies were sent by Ares to find Kratos who broke his oath. 6 months later, Kratos met a Fury/Demigod named Orkos who helped Kratos break his connection with Ares. Orkos told Kratos to go to Delphi to meet Aletheia. Kratos was encountered by Pollux and Castor who took Aletheia's rule. Aletheia was blind since her eyes were ripped out by the Furies. Kratos used the Amulet of Uroborus to destroy and construct surfaces. When Kratos came to Delos, Orkos gave Kratos an Oath Stone in which Kratos can use a decoy to get out of the Furies' traps. After finishing the Trials of Archimedes, Kratos and Orkos were sent to Aegaeon the Hecatonchires. The Hecatonchires was a titan who broke his oath and became a prison for oath breakers. Kratos escaped from the insect infested prison and killed Megaera. He later killed Tisiphone, her pet Daimon and Alecto who can transform into a sea monster. Before the Furies died, they made their son, Orkos their oath keeper. Kratos regretfully killed Orkos which broke his oath and made him remember the tragedy made on Calliope and Lysandra. He put Orkos' corpse where Calliope and Lysandra's were.</p><p> </p><h3>God of War: Chains of Olympus</h3><p>Kratos did various tasks for the gods for 10 years. One task included that Kratos must help Helios defeat Morpheus, Atlas and Persephone. The death of Persephone led to Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders. Atlas stated that both he and Kratos will meet again.</p><h3>God of War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186363\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18924/1186363-932295_20060508_screen009.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6750418760469\" data-width=\"597\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 597px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18924/1186363-932295_20060508_screen009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186363\"><img alt=\"Kratos wearing the God of War armour\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18924/1186363-932295_20060508_screen009.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18924/1186363-932295_20060508_screen009.jpg 597w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18924/1186363-932295_20060508_screen009.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18924/1186363-932295_20060508_screen009.jpg 382w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" data-width=\"382\"></a><figcaption>Kratos wearing the God of War armour</figcaption></figure><p>Kratos' last task from Poseidon was to kill the Hydra. The torment of what he had done to his family still haunted him. He wished for forgiveness and sought out Athena.</p><p>Athena and the other gods have become troubled by Ares and she offers Kratos forgiveness if he kills the God of War. Eventually, Kratos finds Pandora's Box and with it's power he is able to kill a god. However, the Box contained the evils of the Great War and infected the other gods. Athena put hope to help Kratos kill Ares. But when he goes to claim his prize, Athena forgives him, but this does not make him forget his past. Kratos attempts suicide, but is saved by Athena. Without Ares, the gods have decided that Kratos will be the new God of War.</p><h3>God of War: Ghost of Sparta</h3><p>Before Kratos actually became a god, he had to find Deimos. Kratos sunk Atlantis which made Poseidon upset. Kratos found Deimos at the Domain of Death. Kratos and Deimos killed the owner of the land named Thanatos. Deimos later died. He was dug to his grave by the Grave Digger (Zeus). The Grave Digger said \"Only one remains\". Kratos is now a God of War.</p><h3>God of War II</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1163983\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58339/1163983-god_of_war.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.125703564728\" data-width=\"533\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 533px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58339/1163983-god_of_war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1163983\"><img alt=\"Kratos overlooking the Temple of the Fates to change his destiny\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px\" data-width=\"852\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58339/1163983-god_of_war.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58339/1163983-god_of_war.jpg 533w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kratos overlooking the Temple of the Fates to change his destiny\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58339/1163983-god_of_war.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58339/1163983-god_of_war.jpg 533w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px\" data-width=\"852\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kratos overlooking the Temple of the Fates to change his destiny</figcaption></figure><p>As a god, Kratos assists the Spartan army and does not associate himself with the other gods, which angers them. Finally, while trying to destroy Rhodes, Zeus intervenes. Zeus gives life to the Colossus of Rhodes and tricks Kratos, telling him how to defeat the giant. Kratos puts all his godly energy in the Blade of Olympus, but it is taken from him by Zeus, who kills him. The titan Gaia helps Kratos escape from Hades and tells him to find the Fates to change his destiny. When he finds them, they cannot do as Gaia says and Kratos slays them. Using the Loom of Fate, Kratos travels back to when Zeus killed him. He battles with the king of the gods and defeats him, but Athena intervenes, at the cost of her own life.</p><p>Athena tells Kratos that Zeus was trying to break the cycle of the son killing the father and that Kratos is the son of Zeus. This does not deter Kratos from seeking his revenge on Zeus. He uses the Loom once more to go further back in time to the Great War between the Titans and the Olympians. He rallies the Titans to fight with him in the future and kill the gods of Olympus.</p><h3>God of War III</h3><p>Kratos and his Titan allies were attacked by the Gods. After brutally killing Poseidon, he confronts Zeus but is blasted from Mt. Olympus along with Gaia. With his grip slipping, Gaia refuses to help Kratos, stating he to be nothing more than a pawn to serve the Titans, having now brought them to fight Zeus, he outlived his usefulness.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1185854\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18924/1185854-god_of_war_iii_20100114113513333.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.7527950310559\" data-width=\"805\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 805px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18924/1185854-god_of_war_iii_20100114113513333.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1185854\"><img alt=\"Kratos ready for Zeus\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18924/1185854-god_of_war_iii_20100114113513333.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18924/1185854-god_of_war_iii_20100114113513333.jpg 805w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18924/1185854-god_of_war_iii_20100114113513333.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kratos ready for Zeus\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18924/1185854-god_of_war_iii_20100114113513333.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18924/1185854-god_of_war_iii_20100114113513333.jpg 805w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18924/1185854-god_of_war_iii_20100114113513333.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kratos ready for Zeus</figcaption></figure><p>Kratos fell into Hades Realm, where he is greeted by Athena, who had become some sort of Angel and agrees to help Kratos, so can mankind be freed from Zeus's grasp, and told he should extinguish Olympus' source of power, the Flame of Olympus.

This heritage allows him to possess a number physical attributes and powers. Kratos possesses an unknown level superhuman strength. His strength seems to fluctuate according to the situation that requires it. He can go from having enough strength to open certain doors one minute to having the strength to combat beings of massive strength and size the next. His greatest feats of strength include wrestling the mighty Hydra into submission, going toe to toe with Hercules, resisting being crushed between the fingers of the Titans Atlas and Cronos, tossing the Colossus of Rhodes after it attempted to crush Kratos under it’s foot, and overpowering Zeus himself. Kratos also has a decent degree of durability, being able to survive attacks and situations that would easily kill a normal man. Such feats of durability include falling from great heights and walking away unharmed, getting crushed, stabbed, beaten, blasted, and burned by various enemies and traps he’s encountered. Kratos also has the ability to sense incoming danger and react quite fast. Under normal conditions, Kratos has the speed of an Olympic athlete, but when possessing the Boots of Hermes {see Weapons and Equipment}, his speed increases. Kratos has superhuman stamina. In fact, Kratos has never been sown to tire at all. Kratos is a master of weaponry, able to pick up any weapon and use it like an expert. Kratos is excellent in the arts of war, able to execute brutal strategies to win almost any battle. He has shown to be a capable magic user, but only in offensive spells {see Magic}. After Ares' defeat, Kratos became the new God of War. The only power shown as the God of War was the ability to grow in size, but it is implied that Kratos could have done far more. Kratos also possessed the power of Hope, a unique and undefined power that, when tapped into, allowed Kratos to become immune to Zeus’ attacks, and was able to hit Zeus while in an ethereal form.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Blades of Chaos/Athena/Exile</h3><p>Kratos' main weapons. A large pair of axe-like swords that are attached to chains which, in turn, are attach to Kratos wrists. Allows Kratos to attack at great length with great power and speed. Blades emit flames and can cause explosions. Basically an extension of Kratos body, Kratos has complete control over them and can do an number of tasks with them other than for attacking such as pulling objects and swinging.</p><h3>The Blade of Artemis</h3><p>A large sword glowing with energy. Once owned by the Goddess Artemis, she said that she once used it to slay a Titan. In Kratos' hands it can cleave a man sized ememy in two with one slash.</p><h3>The Blade of the Gods</h3><p>A large sword once used as a bridge. When Kratos was stripped of his powers and weapons by Ares, Kratos used this large weapon to bring the mighty god to his knees and ultimatly kill him.</p><h3>The Gauntlet of Zeus</h3><p>Forged by Hephaestus to help Zeus imprision the Titans in Tartarus, the massive metal fist amplifies Kratos punching strength to unbelievable degrees. Also emits electricity.</p><h3>Barbarian Hammer</h3><p>A large spiked hammer once weilded by Kratos' nemesis, The Barbarian King. This weapon is slow to used but makes up for it's lack of speed with great crushing power. Can emit waves of energy an summon the souls of the Dead.</p><h3>Spear of Destiny</h3><p>This magical Spear is covered in purple crystals and can also extend it's length. The crystals can be shot out like a shotgun, be placed as bombs, or can turn enemies into living bombs.</p><h3>Claws of Hades</h3><p>Cruel hooks once used by the God of the Underworld himself. Can rip the souls from living beings and summon the souls of the dead.</p><h3>Nemean Cestus</h3><p>A large pair of lion-headed gauntlets.

Can create shockwaves and can break certain objects that otherwise cannot be destroyed.</p><h3>Nemesis Whips</h3><p>Forged by Hephaestus and infused with electricity, these bladed weapons work with speed rather than raw power.</p><h3>The Blade of Olympus</h3><p>Created by Zeus and forged from the Heavens and the Earth, this large golden sword was the very weapon that ended the Great War and defeated the Titans. This powerful weapon glows with blue energy and has the power to lay waste to entire armies in a single slash. Also infused with Kratos' godly power.</p><h2>Magic Abilities</h2><h3>Poseidon's Rage</h3><p>Harnessing the power of sea storms, Kratos can vaporize his enemies with powerful streams of lightning.</p><h3>Medusa's Gaze</h3><p>Torn from the Gorgon Queen's serpentine body, Kratos can harness the power of Medusa's head to turn his enemies to solid stone.</p><h3>Zeus' Fury</h3><p>Granted to him by the King of the Gods himself, Kratos can hurl thunderbolts at his enemies from afar. Can be charged for a devastating blast of lightning.</p><h3>Army of Hades</h3><p>The God of the Underworld granted Kratos command of the Dead. Kratos summons invincible vicious warrior spirits to tear his enemies to shreds.

    "description": "<p>Mopsy was the star of a single panel newspaper strip by writer and artist Gladys Parker, one of the few female cartoonist in the 1930s - 1950s.</p> <p>The panels, which started in 1939,  consisted of Mopsy, an attractive working girl modeled on Parker herself, surrounded by a succession of admiring men and her witty responses to their flirting.</p> <p>Eventually some of these strips were collected in Pageant of Comics, later she was featured in original full-length stories in a comic of her own from St. John starting in 1948. This lasted for 19 issues. Starting in 1955 some of these were reprinted in Charlton’s TV Teens Comics, even though she was not a teenager, and had nothing to do with television.    </p>",

    "description": "<p>As opposed to most of his fellow Smashers, Beauford is a man that really has his act together. Having gotten a football scholarship in college, the man actually took full advantage of the academic facilities. Of course, he's one heck of a football player, too, so when he made it to the N.F.L., Beauford had a full education, one primarily focusing on business and finance, to back him up after his pro career. </p><p>Over time, Beauford came to be good friends with Jack 'Mr. Magnificent' Magniconte, as well as Thomas 'Suicide' Smythe and Dallas 'Dasher' Corbin, three of his fellow Smashers. Beauford was such good friends with this trio that, when Jack developed startling paranormal powers, his so-called 'edge', he joined up with Jack, Jack's wife Darlene, and the other two to form Kickers, Inc. </p><p>The purpose of this group was primarily to serve as an outlet for Jack's sense of personal responsibility, so he could use his incredible powers to help others in need - not just to score touchdowns. Of course, Beauford and his fellow Kickers would help him to do so by accompanying him on investigations into the bizarre, assisting people in the resolution of problems no one else can solve. </p><p>Of course, Beauford had more to offer to this group than his mere physical power; you see, he came up with the idea of running Kickers, Inc. as a sort of non-profit organization, thus gaining the football players one heck of a tax shelter. While they made no money doing their Kickers, Inc. adventuring, Beauford and the guys saved tons of money on their taxes, which more than made up for not getting paid. </p><p>For over a year, Beauford and his fellow Kickers went on one bizarre adventure after another, encountering robotic mini-tanks, would-be sorcerers, paranormal outlaws, and more. However, a particularly pesky C.I.A. operative determined that Jack was more human than human, and tried to induct him into the C.I.A.'s sphere of influence. Refusing, Jack decided to join the Army to serve his country in a way that he chose. </p><p>This kind of left Kickers, Inc. without their primary paranormal muscle, but with paranormals popping up like crazy at about this time, it's likely that the team had more than enough odd jobs to keep them busy. So, despite the lack of Jack, it's most likely that Beauford stuck with the Kickers, Inc. ideal along with Darlene and his fellow Smashers, helping those in need to this very day! </p>",

    "deck": "The wide receiver for the New York Smashers, Dallas 'Dasher' Corbin is also a full-time member of Kickers, Inc., a paranormal investigation firm founded to help people with nowhere else to turn to in regard to their bizarre problems - which he does with style",
    "description": "<p>Like his fellow Kickers, Dallas is a college graduate, though the exact nature of his high level education has yet to be revealed. Unlike Brick Wall and Doll, who use their business and finance acumen on a daily basis for the team, Dallas only seems to bring his high fashion sense to bear on adventures. Most likely, keeping his attitude in mind, he probably didn't go to college for a degree. </p><p>You see, Dallas seems to live for the glory he gains on the football field, and the adulation of his many fans. As such, he likely used his time in college for the express purpose of getting into the NFL. At any rate, he succeeded in getting a place on the New York Smashers due to his excellent performance on his college football team, and as such met up with Jack 'Mr. Magnificent' Magniconte. </p><p>Becoming good friends with the man, alongside Thomas 'Suicide' Smythe and Beauford 'Brick Wall' Wohl, Dallas hooked up with those three Smashers when they, alongside Jack's wife Darlene, formed Kickers, Inc., a paranormal investigation firm that would look into weird problems that people can't solve for themselves. Of course, Kickers, Inc. was also a vehicle for Jack to use his powers responsibly. </p><p>You see, after the White Event, Jack became super-humanly strong and as such, needed something to do with his time besides football - the game wasn't challenging after he began to outclass everybody in the league. Shortly after Kickers started looking into weird issues, Dallas did make one significant contribution to the team - he designed the group's signature blue and white look. </p><p>While the group resisted the idea of a uniform at first, they all eventually came around to it, even Suicide. At any rate, the group functioned well as a team for about a year and a half, after which time Jack had to join the Army to avoid a clandestine attempt by the C.I.A. to recruit him into their ranks. Though deprived of their primary paranormal muscle, the remaining Kickers went on without him. </p><p>Not a quitter by any means, and enjoying the tax breaks that Kickers, Inc. provides him, Dallas likely remained a member of the group after Jack left, and presumably remains a member of the group to this very day. Of course, knowing the man, he's likely done some work on the group's public image, in that the team's look is, like, so eighties. Of course, he wouldn't think that until more recent times... </p>",

    "description": "<p>Thomas didn't start out with a squeaky clean past like his fellows. No, his early years saw him getting involved with a less than ideal crowd, one that wasn't on the up and up. Exactly what Thomas had to do with these folks has yet to be revealed; he may have been a gang member as a youth, involved in various illicit activities, or he might have just been friends with kids who were. </p><p>Regardless, Thomas eventually cleaned his act up, and went to college after he graduated from high school. There, he got into football big time (as opposed to the simple high school play he took part in before), and eventually got himself a nice, cushy job as a running back for the New York Smashers, an up and coming NFL team that was going places. Things were definitely looking up for the man. </p><p>Thomas got along rather well with his teammates, and became particularly good pals with Jack 'Mr. Magnificent' Magniconte, Beauford 'Brick Wall' Wohl, and Dallas 'Dasher' Corbin. They were such good friends that, after Jack developed paranormal powers and decided to use them to help others in need, they decided to team up - with the addition of Jack's wife Darlene - to form Kickers, Inc. </p><p>This group was set up to investigate bizarre mysteries and paranormal occurrences, mostly for those who had nowhere else to turn - and being a non-profit organization, it made a great tax shelter as well. Thomas mostly went along for the ride, enjoying the bizarre adventures the team got mixed up in, though one such mission looked to be a little too dangerous for Thomas' tastes. </p><p>As such, before he went into action on this foray into a hostile foreign nation, Thomas hooked up with a couple of his youthful contacts, and got ahold of a fully functional Uzi 9mm machine gun. Oh, sure, the Kickers had acquired several non-lethal stun rods for use on the job, but these didn't quite seem to cut it for Thomas, who knew what angry men with machine guns would likely do to them if they were caught. </p><p>The gun wound up being useless to him on that mission anyhow, and Thomas decided to abandon it afterwards, sticking to the Kickers' simple stun rods. Of course, things would change soon anyhow, since Jack - the team's main muscle - had to join the Army to avoid a clandestine C.I.A. recruitment attempt. Liking the idea of helping those in need, Thomas stayed on the team even without Jack's help. </p><p> Presumably, the man is with Kickers, Inc. to this very day. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Lady Deadpool is a female version of <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a> from the alternate reality Earth-3010, named Wanda Wilson. Out of a need to belong and feel wanted, she joins the side of a group of rebels fighting against loyalists in the United States (a situation started by factions within the government by fascists and from select states seceding).</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Wanda Wilson was created by the creative team of writer <a href=\"/victor-gischler/4040-55744/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-55744\">Victor Gischler</a> and artist <a href=\"/rob-liefeld/4040-5181/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5181\">Rob Liefeld</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Wanda is a relatively secluded person, not wanting to go out into the sun until her cable goes out. Once outside she is hired by Shamus Onus to protect the face of some \"Rebel's Force.\" Wanda quickly falls in love with the failed actor turned Rebel Leader Charles Randolph, who happens to already have a girlfriend.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1309866-picture_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1309866\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4107883817427\" data-width=\"482\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 482px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1309866-picture_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1309866\"><img alt=\"Lady Deadpool (One-Shot)\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1309866-picture_2.png\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1309866-picture_2.png 482w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1309866-picture_2.png 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1309866-picture_2.png 453w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" data-width=\"453\"></a><figcaption>Lady Deadpool (One-Shot)</figcaption></figure><p>Wanda continues to try and impress Charles one way or another. Lucky for Charles she was there when a very angry man, who had been left by his wife and kids because they wanted to follow the rebellion, decided to assault Charles with his shoe. Wanda is there to intercept the shoe with her face. She lost several teeth in the process but considered it worth it. After she blows the man to \"smithereens\" Charles romantically lifts her from the floor, cementing in Wanda's mind the idea that they're meant to be together.</p><p>Determined to be with Charles, Wanda interrupts an intimate moment between Charles and \"Ginger\", the aforementioned girlfriend, which is then interrupted in turn by General America. Wanda begins to refuse to let that happen but Ginger assaults her with a Taser, rendering her incapacitated.</p><p>General America takes Charles to a secret compound and Onus succeeds in persuading Wanda to rescue him by offering her a ready meal of peach cobbler and shepherd's pie. Of course she takes the job, and ends up fighting General America for her love again.</p><p><a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">General America</a> is leading the loyalists and Wanda heads an assault against forces in Washington D.C. The two have met before - leading to Deadpool 's interference (with <a href=\"/zombie-deadpool/4005-33654/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33654\">Headpool</a>) and the amputation of the General's right arm. As the two meet again, he starts to get the better of her but Deadpool teleports in and helps Wanda take out General America. Deadpool informs Wanda of the plight at hand and because she is so easily sweet-talked into things, she quickly accepts and the two teleport out of that universe. Later, when Deadpool returned to his apartment with Headpool, Lady Deadpool is found playing Guitar Hero with <a href=\"/kidpool/4005-69596/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69596\">Kidpool</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Being the alternate universe version of Deadpool, Wanda Wilson also has incredible athletic ability and fighting prowess. She is skilled with firearms and also has Deadpool's incredible healing factor. It is assumed that she has all the same powers as Deadpool, which include :</p><ul><li>She's an expert in both close and ranged combat weaponry.</li><li>She has a limited immunity to telepathy due to her constantly fluctuating brain cells</li><li>Olympic-level strength, speed, stamina, and agility.</li><li>Lady Deadpool is fluent in several languages, including English, French, Japanese, and Spanish</li><li>Lady Deadpool also has had several personal transportation devices</li><li>Lady Deadpool has an ability often referred to as \"bottomless satchel\", where she can pull guns, explosives, food (usually Hic. brand beer cans) and ammunition, out of nowhere (usually by reaching into one of her pockets, often times pulling out something that was bigger than the pocket itself).</li><li>Lady Deadpool has a very strong healing factor obtained from Wolverine. This healing factor healed her completely from cancer, and grants her the ability to heal any injury within seconds, more complex injuries can take longer. She can even re-grow lost limbs and organs.</li><li>She is one of the few people with enough skill to handle Captain America's shield.</li><li>Her unpredictable fighting style can be advantageous against the likes of Taskmaster, as Taskmaster learns the moves of others using his advanced memory and learns strengths and weaknesses based upon past experience.</li></ul><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Games</h3><h4>Marvel Heroes</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4285593-store_deadpool_ladydeadpool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4285593\" data-ratio=\"2.08\" data-width=\"175\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 175px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:208.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4285593-store_deadpool_ladydeadpool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4285593\"><img alt=\"Marvel Heroes \" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4285593-store_deadpool_ladydeadpool.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4285593-store_deadpool_ladydeadpool.jpg 175w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px\" data-width=\"175\"></a><figcaption>Marvel Heroes </figcaption></figure><p>Lady Deadpool is a playable character in the Marvel Heroes game as a alternate costume for Deadpool.

The wife of <a href=\"/damn-all/4005-68098/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68098\">Damn All</a> and mother of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flying-robert/4005-68097/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68097\">Flying Robert</a>, she and her imaginary family played with Dorothy, told her stories, and taught her to read and write. She was shot to death by Dorothy when she was eleven and they began to tell her stories that she found frightening.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Darling-Come-Home was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grant-morrison/4040-40434/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40434\">Grant Morrison</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doug-braithwaite/4040-7469/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7469\">Doug Braithwaite</a>. She made her first appearance in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doom-patrol-25-imaginary-friends/4000-31495/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-31495\"><em>Doom Patrol </em>#25</a><em>.</em></p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Imaginary Friends</h3><p>Darling-Come-Home and the rest of her family are summoned up by Dorothy Spinner's psionic powers, combined with the presence of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dreamstone/4055-55771/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55771\">materioptikon</a>. She tries to force Dorothy to put on a pair of red shoes, which are a metaphor for growing up, and sings her a song about shoes. She chases Dorothy down when she is rescued by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joshua-clay/4005-54001/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54001\">Joshua Clay</a>. They are defeated when Joshua destroys the materioptikon and Dorothy accepts the need to grow up, and puts on the red shoes, which are now ruby slippers.</p><h3>Who Am I?</h3><p>Darling-Come-Home is summoned up by Dorothy's mind while Dorothy is in a coma. Identifying herself as Dorothy's mother, she speaks to <a href=\"/robotman/4005-4079/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4079\">Robotman</a> about Dorothy's fears and insecurities. She vanishes after warning him that Dorothy's mind may cause bad things to happen.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Darling-Come-Home is a psychic construct. As such, she is functionally immortal for as long as her creator exists, and could presumably continue to exist for as long as the idea of her lives somewhere in someone's mind. She has reality warping abilities, but only so long as she is in proximity to a materioptikon. She can levitate herself. </p>",

His first appearance in comics involved his recruitment of Jenny Swensen into the C.I.A., under the auspices of Project: Spitfire, a small operation meant to curb the growing proliferation of M.A.X. technology throughout the globe. Since her father invented the M.A.X. technology, well, Roth needed her. </p><p> <br/>He put Jenny through her paces, testing her mettle to the ultimate degree, and once she'd passed his tests, Edmund offered her a job. She was kind of wishy-washy about it, so he dropped her and another operative, Jake Travest, into M.A.X.-infested Afghanistan to prove how desperate the Project's job was. Luckily, the two managed to survive the experience (without armor of their own, even)! </p><p>After this little riot, Jenny and Jake joined up with the Project, and Edmund continued to push both combatants into furthering his goals of American supremacy. He continued on with Project: Spitfire throughout the run of Codename: Spitfire and beyond, until the New Universe was canned. It is presumed that, in the aftermath of the War, he is still in charge of the Project. </p><p>Which, in the end, would quite an important agency, what with the massive amounts of paranormals that are appearing across the planet. After all, several governments would try to get their hands on M.A.X. technology to counter the threat that such individuals would present to the global balance of power. And then, Project: Spitfire would have to set them straight, of course...<br/></p>",

Of course, after he built the suit, he accompanied her on the mission, as he wanted to get his hands on the research of Saxon St. John, a bizarre and insane cyberneticist that was experimenting on his neighbors there. </p><p>At any rate, the two Project: Spitfire operatives made their way to the island, and eventually brought down St. John, as the man was crazy enough to let the two into his palace and fight his creations. The Project agents beat the brainwashed cyborgs, and managed to kill Saxon in the process. Of course, Jenny destroyed his computers in a fit of rage after seeing what the man did. </p><p> And after Willy slipped and told her that the government was going to 'confiscate' Saxon's research. </p><p>Willy hasn't seen another comic story since, but as a valued robotics guy, it is assumed that Project: Spitfire maintained his service for future operations. After all, once Jake Travest was captured in the Mark 3 M.A.X. suit in Canada, well, they didn't have anybody else to make or pilot the armor. Willy would have been a prime candidate for both jobs. </p><p> Since, of course, the Project has this unusual habit of putting their lead techs in the direct line of fire constantly... </p>",

Of course, the mission succeeded, and Miss Pollicino was retained to help the Project out on further operations. </p><p>For instance, she put the Mark 3 M.A.X. suit back together after it got trashed in battle with Nicaraguan soldiers, during a mission to determine whether or not the Central American country was utilizing M.A.X. technology. Later, after this operation, she was helping Jenny Swensen to better utilize her Spitfire suit, by assisting in her training maneuvers. </p><p>In addition to this, Miss Pollicino acts as a sort of tactical liaison in all of the Project's missions, whether Jenny Swensen, Jake Travest, or anybody else is wearing the armor. Though the current status of the Project is unknown, it is assumed that Pollicino is still working for them, if not actually wearing the suit on missions.

The intense radiation surrounding and suffusing his body did not tear his cellular structure apart, but changed it. </p><p>Suddenly absorbing vast amounts of the nuclear radiation around him, Dimitri hit his upper limits... and then began to shed the harmful energies. It was at this point that he met the American, Jenny Swensen, who had journeyed there in her experimental, Mark 1 M.A.X. armor! </p><p>She helped Dimitri to cool off, since he was also giving off deadly amounts of heat, by opening a tunnel into an underground river stream. Once he was cooled off, Dimitri told Jenny to bury him in stone, in order to stop his body from contaminating the surrounding area any more. </p><p>Though she didn't want to, Jenny did indeed honor Dimitri's wish, and flew off once she'd entombed the man in the rock that surrounded them. Whether or not this was the end of Dimitri remains to be seen however; he did survive being at ground zero of the Chernobyl incident, after all. </p><p>If his newfound powers could protect him from there, perhaps being buried alive isn't enough to end his life either. As radioactive as the area around him is despite his efforts, it's quite possible that Dimitri's absorption power has been keeping him going to this very day...! </p>",

He became a bounty hunter and eventually earnt the reputation of the galaxy's most highly regarded mercenary, who operated primarily for the financial reward of his missions, particularly after the death of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6344\" href=\"/jango-fett/4005-6344/\" slug=\"jango-fett\">Jango Fett</a>. His closest rival in his trade eventually came to be Jango Fett's son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6354\" href=\"/boba-fett/4005-6354/\" slug=\"boba-fett\">Boba Fett</a>, who also began to build his reputation as a mercenary against the Jedi.</p><p>Bane worked for the highest bidder, caring little for who employed him or the faction that his client represented, as long as he received his pay. His allegiance to his employer was of no matter to him that if he was offered a better fee elsewhere; he had no issues with turning on his original client. His reputation only grew as the war between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems escalated.</p><p>He frequently teamed up with several other bounty hunters and mercenaries in his jobs; among their number was the shapeshifting Clawdite Cato Parasitti, a lethal assassin who shared his allegiance to money. Parasitti subcontracted assignments for him and recruited extra help as he required.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073413-theslightofhand_tcwrhprima.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2073413\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.58670520231214\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073413-theslightofhand_tcwrhprima.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2073413\"><img alt=\"The Sleight of Hand\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073413-theslightofhand_tcwrhprima.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073413-theslightofhand_tcwrhprima.jpg 692w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073413-theslightofhand_tcwrhprima.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Sleight of Hand</figcaption></figure><p>During the war, Bane flew <i>The Sleight of Hand</i>, a Telgorn dropship that he extensively modified himself.

He was contracted to pursue Jedi Master Ring-Sol Ambase, who was setting out on a mission to the planet Kynachi with his Padawan, Nuru Kungurama and a squad of clone troopers. After bypassing the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56739\" href=\"/trade-federation/4060-56739/\" slug=\"trade-federation\">Trade Federation's</a> blockade of the planet and arriving on the Federation-controlled world, Bane recruited a food vendor to identify any strangers in a town on the planet. He provided the vendor with a special comlink that overrode the Federation's frequency jammer, which disrupted communications on the planet. The vendor later contacted Bane to report that Kungurama and three of his squad's clone troopers, who had all been stranded on Kynachi following some sabotage to their ship and were headed with Lalo Gunn to her diner on Kynachi. Complying with Sidious's latest instructions, Bane proceeded to the diner and staged an elaborate deception in order to manipulate the group's actions, summoning four BX-series droid commandos to fake a fight with him at Gunn's starship, the <i>Hasty Harpy.</i></p><p>After the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51783\" href=\"/battle-droids/4005-51783/\" slug=\"battle-droids\">battle droids</a> attacked Kungurama and the clones and were destroyed by the Republic squad, Bane pretended that he had been blinded by a luma grenade where troopers CT-5177 and Knuckles found him lying on the ground. The clones brought Bane into the building, where Kungurama, Gunn, and trooper CT-8863 questioned him on his identity and business. Taking the risk of revealing to the trio that he was a bounty hunter in order to more effectively deceive them, Bane lied and stated that the droid commandos had been trying to arrest him and had opened fire on him when he had tried to run away. When Gunn asked after the reasons for his presence on Kynachi, Bane flatly replied that a job had brought him to the planet, but Gunn, unsatisfied with his vagueness, put one of the fallen droids' E-5 blaster rifles to his forehead and demanded to know how he had bypassed the Trade Federation's blockade.</p><p>Bane stated that he had been hired to break someone out of the KynachTech Industries factory prison and that his client had provided him with a datatape of the facility's schematics and pass codes to get through the Federation blockade. His disclosures earned him freedom from the blaster on his forehead. However, Bane truthfully reported that earlier he had seen the factory's droid guards escorting into the prison four Republic troopers and an unconscious Ring-Sol Ambase. Kungurama, determined to rescue his Master, developed a plan to have CT-8863 build a new droid to break into the prison. This idea was, in fact, the exact plan that Bane had intended for Kungurama to devise. During his time on Kynachi, Bane secretly hired Gunn to ensure that Kungurama and the clones reached the planet Vaced, a task that she accepted for a promised reward.</p><p>Accompanied by the droids, they reconnoitered the prison and Bane then took them to the Kynachi spaceport's Docking Bay 21 to get to <i>The Sleight of Hand,</i> which they had planned to use to escape from the planet once the prisoners were rescued. The four then returned where CT-8863 and Kungurama were assembling the new droid. The unit was successfully reactivated and was renamed Cleaver. With Kungurama, Gunn, the troopers, and Bane posing as prisoners, and Cleaver acting as their droid captor, they were admitted into the facility. Upon entrance, the members of the squad dropped their disguises and confronted the facility's <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56713\" href=\"/techno-union/4060-56713/\" slug=\"techno-union\">Techno Union</a> overseer, Umbrag. As Kungurama cornered Umbrag and demanded information from him, the Overseer inadvertently caused a battle droid to fire its blaster rifle. At the sound of blaster fire, Bane drew his blaster pistols and began a chaotic fight.</p><p>With the others' attention focused on the battle, Bane was able to slip away and capture Ring-Sol Ambase. Bane placed the comatose Ambase in a transparisteel stasis pod to keep him in his near-death condition. Eventually, he returned to the prison with Ambase's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\" href=\"/lightsaber/4055-44097/\" slug=\"lightsaber\">lightsaber</a> and found Kungurama, Gunn and the troopers, who had driven Umbrag away and had been reunited with the rest of their clone squad. Bane lied to the group, saying that he had been unsuccessful in finding his previous quarry. The clones didn't trust him, but Bane gave Ambase's lightsaber to Kungurama with the lie that it was all he had found of Ambase. Thus Bane received Kungurama's thanks before departing, though he refused to give the Padawan his name. Bane used a gravsled taken from the KynachTech factory to transport Ambase's stasis pod and returned to <i>The Sleight of Hand</i> in Docking Bay 21, bringing Ambase's body onto the vessel. Departing from the planet, Bane used his pass codes to bypass several Republic Navy Star Destroyers. After evading the cruisers and activating his ship's automated pilot mode, Bane returned to the main cabin and contacted Sidious, to whom he reported his success. The Sith Lord was pleased with the result and told Bane to deliver Ambase to Bogg V, the fifth moon of the Bogden system.</p><p>He eventually landed on Bogg V near the solar sailer and met with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46932\" href=\"/asajj-ventress/4005-46932/\" slug=\"asajj-ventress\">Asajj Ventress</a>, an agent of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5392\" href=\"/count-dooku/4005-5392/\" slug=\"count-dooku\">Count Dooku</a>. After showing Ventress how to operate Ambase's stasis pod, Bane handed the inert Ambase over to her and completed the transaction. He then received Sidious's next assignment from her and left for the Bilbringi system to secure the Bilbringi Depot, the primary settlement of the system's largest asteroid, Bilbringi VII.</p><p>Sidious gave him one thousand peggats to buy the depot from its owner, Drixo the Hutt, but Bane also took three IG-86 sentinel droids in case Drixo refused to sell her property. Arriving at Bilbringi Depot, Bane was stopped by two <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56704\" href=\"/gamorreans/4060-56704/\" slug=\"gamorreans\">Gamorrean</a> guards at the entrace to Drixo's headquarters. He attempted to bribe them into admitting him to the compound with chips of precious metal. When the Gamorreans demanded more, Bane simply killed them with his silencer-capped blasters, retrieved his metal offerings, and admitted himself to the depot. Proceeding to Drixo's chamber, Bane was intercepted by several of her bodyguards, and he was removed of his blasters and peggat satchel. Speaking with Drixo from the chamber overlooking her pit, Bane conveyed his client's offer to buy Bilbringi Depot for the one thousand peggats. Although Drixo dismissed the bid, she also refused to return the peggats.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073798-830px_cadbane_tcwrh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2073798\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56265060240964\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073798-830px_cadbane_tcwrh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2073798\"><img alt=\"Bane retrieving his blasters from the guards\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073798-830px_cadbane_tcwrh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073798-830px_cadbane_tcwrh.jpg 830w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073798-830px_cadbane_tcwrh.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bane retrieving his blasters from the guards\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073798-830px_cadbane_tcwrh.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073798-830px_cadbane_tcwrh.jpg 830w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073798-830px_cadbane_tcwrh.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bane retrieving his blasters from the guards</figcaption></figure><p>With Drixo remaining uncooperative, Bane had his IG-86 sentinel droids enter the room and and open fire. Bane then also retrieved his blasters from the guards and promptly killed them too. With all of Drixo's guards dead, Bane dispatched the two Theelinservants as well. Although Drixo begged for her life and offered to give Bilbringi Depot to him for free, Bane simply had his droids eliminate her as well, claiming the depot by force. Bane then reported to Sidious the successful capture of Bilbringi Depot, and a pleased Sidious transferred the bounty hunter's payment to his account.</p><h3>Mission from Darth Sidious</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073432-830px_banesidioushh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2073432\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.49638554216867\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073432-830px_banesidioushh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2073432\"><img alt=\"Contacted by Darth Sidious\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073432-830px_banesidioushh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073432-830px_banesidioushh.jpg 830w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073432-830px_banesidioushh.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Contacted by Darth Sidious\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073432-830px_banesidioushh.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2073432-830px_banesidioushh.jpg 830w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2073432-830px_banesidioushh.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Contacted by Darth Sidious</figcaption></figure><p>Bane was eventually hired by Darth Sidious for another ruse, however before he was hired for his initial mission, he had to firstly prove his skills in another mission to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56430\" href=\"/senate-building/4020-56430/\" slug=\"senate-building\">Senate Building</a>. He was to discover the location of Ord Enisence, a Jedi Master whom Sidious wanted eliminated. Blasting his way through the Senate security, Bane uncovered the location of Ord Enisence and killed him. He then moved his body to his apartment in an Underworld Coruscant hotel, where Sidious eventually contacted him again with his real mission; stealing a holocron from the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56425\" href=\"/jedi-temple/4020-56425/\" slug=\"jedi-temple\">Jedi Temple's</a> Archives which was under the protection of Jedi Master; Bolla Ropal. Sidious would use this to unlock the Kyber memory crystal which within it recorded all Force-sensitive infants in the galaxy. Sidious additionally provided the schematics of the Temple.</p><p>In preparation for the operation, Bane subcontracted Cato Parasitti for assistance and prepared his techno-service droid, Todo 360, for the job. Bane thus installed an explosive in the droid. Parasitti and Bane studied Sidious's intelligence file on Ropal together. Despite Sidious's inside information, Bane still required an agent on the inside of the Temple. Parasitti thus assumed the form of Ord Enisence. Bane passed an ear-comlink to Parasitti so that they could maintain contact, and although Parasitti questioned the details of Bane's own plan to break into the Jedi Temple Holocron Vaults, Bane kept a calm demeanor and stated that he would handle it. With that, the bounty hunters proceeded to the Jedi Temple and set their plan into motion.</p><p>Bane and Todo used their rocket boots to reach an unattended overhang on the side of the Jedi Temple, close to the building's roof. At a computer terminal in the Archive Library, Todo was able to locate a weak point in the Temple's energy shield and opened up an aperture. Bane and his droid zoomed in through the breach and entered a ventilation shaft, where they descended into a wide, vertical passage that was being blocked by a set of large, active fans. Parasitti directed Todo to the control board, and the droid deactivated the fans so that he and Bane could slip between their blades. Once Bane and Todo had passed between the blades of one of the fans, the droid accidentally reactivated the fan from a motion-sensing security switch. Before the two could be sucked into and sliced by the blades, Parasitti disabled the fan, saving both of them.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074223-830px_baneholocronchamber_hh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2074223\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.50240963855422\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074223-830px_baneholocronchamber_hh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2074223\"><img alt=\"Bane enters the Holocron Vaults\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074223-830px_baneholocronchamber_hh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074223-830px_baneholocronchamber_hh.jpg 830w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074223-830px_baneholocronchamber_hh.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bane enters the Holocron Vaults\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074223-830px_baneholocronchamber_hh.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074223-830px_baneholocronchamber_hh.jpg 830w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074223-830px_baneholocronchamber_hh.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bane enters the Holocron Vaults</figcaption></figure><p>With the way clear, the pair continued on through the vent system to a shaft directly overlooking the high-security Holocron Vaults, which was being protected by a dense laser web. Although Todo wanted to bypass the grate, Bane stopped him and checked with Parasitti on the vault's security measures. Bane noted a change in his comrade's voice, as the shapeshifting Parasitti had assumed the form of Jedi librarian Jocasta Nu. Hearing the sounds of the Jedi searching for them, Bane impatiently waited as Parasitti deactivated the vault's laser sensor system from her terminal. The instant that the primary laser systems were down, Bane and Todo descended into the shaft leading to the Holocron Vaults. While Bane used his gauntlet to cut through the safe's lock mechanism, Todo deactivated the remainder of the laser beams surrounding the vault's entrance. Bane then directed Todo, with his own hidden intentions, to slice through the wall and cut a passage to the Temple's communication center in order to have him lure the Jedi away from the vault.</p><p>Meanwhile, Parasitti was captured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55028\" href=\"/ahsoka-tano/4005-55028/\" slug=\"ahsoka-tano\">Ahsoka Tano</a> and revealed Bane's objective to the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\" href=\"/jedi/4015-52199/\" slug=\"jedi\">Jedi</a>. Thus losing contact with his inside agent, Bane was unable to access the diagrams that would help him deactivate the lock. He told Todo to go to the Jedi Temple's communication center to pose as a distraction for the Jedi, and once the droid departed, Bane primed a bomb of the same model that he had installed in the droid to break through the vault's lock. Bane was then forced to hide from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\" href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\" slug=\"darth-vader\">Anakin Skywalker</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\" href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\" slug=\"obi-wan-kenobi\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, who were approaching his location and who had also been tipped off by Tano to the mercenary's whereabouts. As the explosive went off, he waited until the pair had followed Todo to the communication center before emerging from the shadows. He entered through the Holocron Vaults' door and proceeded unopposed into the room, where he then extracted the holocron from its holding place. After obtaining the holocron, he donned a Jedi robe and snuck away through the Archive Library. Despite catching sight of a cuffed Parasitti being led away by Tano and Jocasta Nu, Bane did not attempt to rescue her and escaped the Temple, leaving Parasitti in the Jedi's custody and allowing Todo to serve his purpose as a decoy by being destroyed by the explosive that he had installed inside him earlier.</p><h3><span id=\"Exploits_at_Devaron\">Exploits at Devaron</span></h3><p>With hired assistance from fellow bounty hunter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5421\" href=\"/aurra-sing/4005-5421/\" slug=\"aurra-sing\">Aurra Sing</a>, Bane took a fleet of Munificent-class frigates and C-9979 landing craft to mount a surprise attack on the planet <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56410\" href=\"/devaron/4020-56410/\" slug=\"devaron\">Devaron</a>, where Bolla Ropal maintained a Republic base called the Temple of Eedit. Initiating a ground assault on the planet and commanding his armada from his lead Munificent-class frigate, Bane contacted Sing's battle droid squad, Nashtah Team, to check on her progress. Sing reported that she was on the western end of the valley where the outpost was located, but even though she spotted Ropal and had a clear shot at him, Bane ordered her not to shoot the Jedi Master, as he was his target. Instead, Bane told Sing to distract Ropal's Padawan Tyzen Xebec and several clones who had just arrived. In the meantime, Bane left his command ship and moved in to capture Ropal.</p><p>Flying in a Rogue-class starfighter, Bane shot several clone troopers before landing and heading for Ropal's position. Along the way, Bane received word from his command ship's crew that the Republic <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56087\" href=\"/star-destroyer/4055-56087/\" slug=\"star-destroyer\">Star Destroyer</a> <i>Resolute</i> had arrived out of hyperspace and realized that Parasitti had betrayed his target to the Jedi, at which he swore to return the favor. Bane ordered his fleet into defensive formation to stop the <i>Resolute</i> before it could interrupt his task. He found Ropal deflecting blaster shots with his lightsaber and loaded an expensive shot of cortosis ore into his blaster pistol, using it to short out Ropal's weapon. With Ropal disarmed, Bane threw a cord at the Jedi Master, tying his legs together and knocking him to the ground.</p><p>Ropal refused to open the holocron for Bane, so Bane ordered one of his super battle droids shock him and thus rendering him unconscious. Bane took Ropal hostage and loaded him on board a <i>Sheathipede</i>-class transport shuttle and taking him to his command ship. They were eventually ambushed by the <i>Resolute</i>, commanded by Anakin Skywalker. Ordering his battle droid crew to move the ship out of the battle zone and prepare to jump to hyperspace, Bane went to confront Ropal in the holding cell, as only a Jedi could open the holocron and combine it with the Kyber crystal to make it readable. However, the <i>Resolute</i> targeted the frigate's hyperdrive and compromised the ship's power converters, trapping Bane in the system.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074228-bane_tortures_ropal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2074228\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.42571428571429\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074228-bane_tortures_ropal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2074228\"><img alt=\"Bane torturing Bolla Ropal\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074228-bane_tortures_ropal.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074228-bane_tortures_ropal.jpg 700w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074228-bane_tortures_ropal.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bane torturing Bolla Ropal\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074228-bane_tortures_ropal.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074228-bane_tortures_ropal.jpg 700w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074228-bane_tortures_ropal.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bane torturing Bolla Ropal</figcaption></figure><p>Though Bane tortured Ropal with electrical charges, the Jedi Master continued to refuse to unlock the crystal with the holocron. Having no use for an uncooperative prisoner, Bane ordered his droid subordinate to increase Ropal's electrocution to full power, killing the Jedi Master. Bane saw this murder as only a slight setback to achieving his objective, but he still required a Jedi to access the crystal.</p><p>As Skywalker and Tano landed on the dorsal hull of Bane's frigate, Bane refused to send out Vulture droid reinforcements into the battle to the surprise of both his battle droid crew and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5409\" href=\"/nute-gunray/4005-5409/\" slug=\"nute-gunray\">Gunray</a>. Although Gunray demanded that he transmit the information and abandon the plan before the Jedi boarded his ship and stole the holocron back, Bane replied that he could not submit the data, but still intended to let Skywalker and Tano embark his ship in order to get one of them to unlock the crystal with the holocron. Ending his conversation with Gunray, Bane gave orders to his crew, telling them to wipe the frigate's memory, activate the self-destruct sequence, and transfer control of all shipboard functions to his wrist-com.</p><p>Leaving his battle droids to defend the bridge, Bane escaped through a ventilation duct moments before Skywalker, Tano, Clone <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56951\" href=\"/captain-rex/4005-56951/\" slug=\"captain-rex\">Captain Rex</a>, and their clone trooper squad arrived and captured it from the droids. On the frigate's gunnery deck, Bane assembled lines of B1 and B2 battle droids, intending to have them fight and distract the clones while he himself separated the Jedi and led one of them away. With his troops in place, Bane ran through the hallways of his frigate and lured the Jedi and clones to the gunnery deck. Once Skywalker, Tano, and the clones had arrived in the darkened room, Bane revealed his forces by reactivating the lights and ordered the droids to open fire on the Jedi and clones. As a gunfight erupted as planned, Bane secured himself to the floor with his magno-grip boots and increased the fight's stakes by disabling the frigate's gravity generators, and deactivating the artificial gravity. The Jedi and clones rose off the floor, while the battle droids, still magnetized to the deck, continued to fire at them. Bane targeted his blaster fire at Skywalker, who made it past him, and the bounty hunter quickly got out of range of the Jedi's lightsaber slashes. Bane opened fire on the clones, shooting and killing several of them. However, Skywalker soon returned to fight Bane, surprising him from behind and delivering a kick that knocked the holocron out of his grip. Just as Skywalker was about to grab the holocron, the astromech droid <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2594\" href=\"/r2-d2/4005-2594/\" slug=\"r2-d2\">R2-D2</a> reactivated the gravity.</p><p>Bane retrieved the holocron and shot at a trooper still magnetized to the roof, keeping Skywalker occupied with safely lowering the clone to the floor while he himself made his escape. Bane drew Tano after him, and the Padawan fell into his trap. Luring Tano into a dead-end corridor away from Skywalker, Bane cut her off from her Master by closing the hallway's blaster doors. Bane's first laser shot at the Padawan was deflected back at one of his gauntlets, but he managed to deliver a kick that knocked her lightsaber out of her hand. Before he could fire at her again, Tano brazenly grabbed his blaster arm and flipped him to the ground. Bane stopped Tano from retrieving her lightsaber by grabbing her ankle and sending a paralyzing stun charge through her body that knocked her unconscious. He picked up the holocron and placed Tano in self-tightening stun cuffs that had been specially designed for Jedi.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074229-830px_banetorturesahsoka.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2074229\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.42530120481928\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074229-830px_banetorturesahsoka.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2074229\"><img alt=\"Bane electrocuting Ahsoka Tano\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074229-830px_banetorturesahsoka.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074229-830px_banetorturesahsoka.jpg 830w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074229-830px_banetorturesahsoka.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bane electrocuting Ahsoka Tano\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074229-830px_banetorturesahsoka.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/51394/2074229-830px_banetorturesahsoka.jpg 830w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/51394/2074229-830px_banetorturesahsoka.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bane electrocuting Ahsoka Tano</figcaption></figure><p>Once Tano had woken up, Bane stole her Padawan braid jewelry from her as a trophy. Bane then electrocuted Tano and moved her to the frigate's airlock and placed her on the space-ward side of the shield. After receiving word from a battle droid outside the airlock that Skywalker had arrived, Bane activated the airlock's shield, trapping Tano so that she could serve as a bargaining chip.</p><p>Skywalker entered the room to find Tano at Bane's mercy, and Bane demanded that Skywalker unlock the memory crystal, fully prepared to open the airlock to the vacuum of space and send Tano to her death if he refused to do so. With his Padawan's life at risk, Skywalker handed over his lightsaber and used the Force to disassemble the holocron, combining it with the crystal and making the crystal's contents readable.</p><p>Once Bane had taken the holocron, Skywalker retrieved Tano's lightsaber and his own weapon with the Force and made quick work of Bane's super battle droid bodyguards. In retaliation, Bane opened the airlock, keeping the two Jedi occupied while he flew away with his rocket boots through an emergency bulkhead that sealed behind him. Bane made contact with Gunray and informed him of his success with gaining access to the crystal.</p><p>After forcing Anakin Skywalker to unlock it, Bane was sent to kidnap four of the Force-sensitive infants which were listed in the crystal. Eventually, he was captured by Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano after delivering two of the children to Sidious's secret facility on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56941\" href=\"/mustafar/4020-56941/\" slug=\"mustafar\">Mustafar</a>. Bane however manages to lure Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\" href=\"/mace-windu/4005-5395/\" slug=\"mace-windu\">Mace Windu</a> into a trap on his hideout, and subsequently escaped from the Jedi's custody.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>One of the galaxy's most lethal, ruthless, fearsome, and deadly bounty hunters, Cad Bane earned the reputation of the foremost blaster-for-hire during the Clone Wars, filling the position that fellow mercenary Jango Fett had occupied until his death. Quintessentially cold, cruel, calculating, and extremely capable in his line of work, Bane was unscrupulous and had much less moral content than his closest rival, Boba Fett. He completely ignored the morality of his work and often turned upon his own clients if he needed to. His loyalty was ultimately to credits and therefore to the highest bidder. His usual rate was considerable, but so was his reputation, to the point that his quarries knew that nothing would stop him from capturing them. Bane regarded credits with the highest importance, and though he did not pass up the opportunity to demand more pay from his clients when one arose, he was very dedicated to his work if paid the right amount for it, taking on jobs that were considered to be tough, costly,dangerous, and even impossible. If offered the appropriate payment, he did not place any restrictions on the client or contracted quarry, regardless of whether the latter was a person or a possession.</p><p>Crafty, resourceful, vicious, and brutally ruthless, Bane was a clever strategist. Displays of his astuteness included his arrangement for rival mercenary Davtokk to unwittingly serve as a test for his own team of hunters, his wily pilferage of the murdered Denal's armor to ensure his own escape from the Jedi at Devaron, and his ruse for Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi at Black Stall Station that enabled him to make another getaway. He chose to orchestrate his raid on the Senate during guard shift changes to maximize his operation's element of surprise and thus casualties by eliminating the majority of the active Senate security all at once, thereby showing his opponents no mercy. Even when tasked with bounties like the recapture of Ziro, he did not falter in the tenacious and treacherous pursuit of his quarry.</p><p>Bane was tirelessly patient, and it was said that he could not be stopped and would pursue his prey across the galaxy if necessary, no matter how dangerous the mission or the target. He was both respected and feared in his line of work, and he would not let anyone stand in his way. Bane was autonomous as a bounty hunter and did not place his trust in others easily or often, believing that the best way to ensure that a task was completed was to do it himself. Although he did not always operate alone, he usually worked solo, as doing so gave him the freedom of improvisation and more credits that did not have to be split with others. When he recognized that the job was big enough, he employed his fellow hunters for assistance, though he preferred to keep both his methods for selecting comrades for joint operations and his introduction into the bounty business itself obscure to the galaxy at large.</p><p>He proved his skill as a leader while commanding the posse that he formed to free Ziro the Hutt from Republic custody, and his assured manner and brutal methods earned him respect from his underlings. Bane displayed a lack of concern for his accomplices, caring little what happened to his team after they had liberated Ziro, provided that they avoided capture by the Republic. Additionally, when his comrade, Cato Parasitti, was captured by the Jedi during their joint infiltration of the Jedi Temple, Bane did not attempt to rescue her. Instead, he ignored her plight and left her in the Jedi's custody to continue his work for Darth Sidious.</p><p>Bane was smooth and thorough in his jobs and did not leave a mess behind unless he was paid to do so. Despite his penchant for a good fight, Bane preferred to use stealth and surprise tactics to avoid a direct fight when possible. Although he would have enjoyed taking down the likes of Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker and indeed pursued them on several occasions, Bane did not let personal feelings get in the way of his work.</p><h2>Skills and abilities</h2><ul><li>Able to speak Galactic Basic Standard, thus understood Huttese, Jawaese and other languages</li><li>Possessed a \"stoic tolerance\" for pain and Jedi mind tricks</li><li>Skilled in the various forms of the art of combat; known as one of the deadliest beings in the galaxy with a blaster.</li><li>Skilled in unarmed combat</li><li>Adequate starship pilot</li></ul><h2>Equipment</h2><ul><li>A pair of personalized BlasTech LL-30 blaster pistols</li><li>Explosives</li><li>Bola</li><li>Small hold-out pistol</li><li>A customized projectile carbine, used to short out lightsabers with cortosis</li><li>Durasteel ice pick</li><li>Cybernetic breathing tubes</li><li>Durasteel magno-grip boots were equipped with customized Mitrinomon jetpack thrusters</li><li>Wrist gauntlets, which included a variety of control devices, built-in tools, and weapons, including a cable launcher, comlink, data uplink, lanyard, non-lethal contact stunners, a projectile launcher and a flamethrower.</li></ul>",

However, when Casey snatched her glasses back and put them on, she saw the world  through a very different perspective.<br/> <h2>Mayor Story Arcs<br/></h2><h3>Demon Baseball</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1026926-tul_uth2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1026926\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.76640625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1026926-tul_uth2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1026926\"><img alt=\"The Death Of Bill Kinmont\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1026926-tul_uth2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1026926-tul_uth2.jpg 1280w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/1026926-tul_uth2.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1026926-tul_uth2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Death Of Bill Kinmont</figcaption></figure>The players on the visiting team were all demons.  The sky was black &amp; purple.  However, no-one else seemed to notice it! The stranger whom she'd hit with the baseball informed her that he had performed an enchantment on her glasses; that she would see the world as it truly was.  He added that the visiting side had been possessed, and that if the home team lost then it would cost her grandfather his life. Casey rushed into the stadium and insisted on seeing her granddad.  Although the bodyguards refused to let her through (as was the old man's usual rules), she pushed her way through.  Inside his office, her grandfather was distraught.  He explained that he had made a drunken deal with a demon named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67381\" href=\"/tuluth/4005-67381/\" slug=\"tuluth\">   Tul'Uth</a> 30 years previously.   <br/> <br/> Tul'Uth appeared and  bound the stranger &amp; Casey back to back, and began to taunt the stranger.  Tul'Uth recognized <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\" href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" slug=\"doctor-strange\">   Doctor Strange </a>and mocked him for the drastic decline in his powers.  However, Tul'Uth also revealed that the deal with the previous team of Portland Loggers was based on the team who played at the stadium; not on the individual players.  Therefore, on the day that the contract expired he had possessed the visiting team and used magic to cheat, and claim the lives of the home team.  When Bill Kinmont accused Tul'Uth of cheating, the demon grew angry and incinerated the old man right before Casey's eyes.   <br/> <h3>Performing Magic</h3>Tul'Uth left the coach's office, leaving Strange &amp; Casey still  bound.  She cried over her grandfather's still burning ashes, but Strange wouldn't let her grieve.  His hands were shaky, and therefore he couldn't create the correct gesture to cast a spell to free them.  He made Casey flex her right hand into the necessary posture and repeat the magic words he told her to.  It ws difficult for Casey, who was distraught over the death of her grandfather.  As she managed to repeat the last word of the spell, she began to glow purple, and the magical binding around her &amp; Strange disappeared. Strange congratulated her on being a natural.  Casey seemed to ignore him.  She collapsed to the ground and sobbed for her granddad.  She had been his little princess, but suddenly lost her entire world.  When Strange tried to build her confidence and ask for her help to save everyone in the stadium, Casey seemed lost in her grief. <br/> <h3>Still In Play </h3>By the time Casey managed to pull herself together, Strange had put himself into the game of baseball.  He substituted the batter, and made two strikes.  It looked like he was about to make a third strike when Casey interfered. Using the same magical gesture as before, she cast a spell over the ball.  It flew away from the catcher and darted around.  Casey cried to Strange to run as the ball was still in play.  Despite the possessed team's best efforts to stop him, Strange managed to complete a home run and won the game for the home team. The possessed demons disappeared, and the sky returned to daylight blue.  The crowd cheered as Casey ran &amp; leapt into Strange's arms with a celebratory hug.  He showed her the baseball, which was the new prison for Tul'Uth.  She realized that he had manipulated the baseball into hitting him in the face earlier, which he admitted was a little misdirection.  Although he sincerely apologized for what happened to her grandad, Casey left Strange to wash her face. <br/> <h3>Magical Princess </h3>Alone in the ladies bathroom, Casey continued to cry.  She'd taken her glasses off to wash her face.  As she replaced her glasses, she looked up into the bathroom mirror and saw her reflection through the enchanted lenses.  Instead of the fiesty college girl with black hair &amp; midnight blue highlights, she saw a little girl with an emerald green gown with gold embroidery, with a grown on her auburn hair. Casey narrowed her eyes  in determination.  She ran back out onto the pitch and cried out to Strange.  She wanted to know what he'd meant previously when he called her a 'natural'.  However, he had already cast his spell and began to disappear in front of her eyes.  Casey was left standing in the middle of the empty baseball diamond.  By her feet there was the mysterious emblem of Strange's <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55966\" href=\"/sanctum-sanctorum/4020-55966/\" slug=\"sanctum-sanctorum\">   Sanctum Sanctorum</a>, which she didn't recognize.  She was left wondering what to do next. <br/><h3>Magic Abuse </h3>With the knowledge of how to repeat the spell Strange had taught her, Casey began to use the spell to remove real-life irritations.  While in an internet cafe she made a stranger's cellular phone disappear, and later she used it again to remove the clamp from her car.  She had used it several times, and even used it to remove the removal's van that he cousins were using to haul away her late-granddad's belongings. It had been a severe shock to see them turn up at the house, helping themselves to anything they believed to be of value.  She tried to argue with them, to force them to leave since they had never given any time to their grand-father while he was alive.  However, because of problems with his will, they had the property declared a joint family asset and therefore continued to loot his belongings.  Taunted with the title 'Princess', Casey withdrew feeling sorry for herself. Therefore when she saw the removals van parked outside, she decided to make it disappear with the only spell she knew. Casey would only leave the house when it was being guarded by her friend Nissa, who she could see was 'a bad-ass at heart'.<br/><h3>The Search For Strange </h3>Casey used the magical logo left behind in the dirt as a clue, and she began searching for Doctor Strange.  Armed with her glasses that reveal the true nature of everything, she began to meet with other internet users who had responded to her.  However, despite their outer appearances she could see them for the raving lunatics, wannabe casanovas or even a deadly demon. Chosk-Dynn had posed as a handsome blond man in a restaurant to coerce information out of Casey.  At first he explained Doctor Strange's background, and what the title of Sorcerer Supreme meant.  He then grew angry &amp; aggressive when demanding that she give him information on Strange's current whereabouts in return.  However, Casey was terrified &amp; repulsed by the demon's true form.  Chosk-Dynn would have attacked her if Strange hadn't appeared from a nearby table and distracted the demon with salt-water. <br/><h3>Strange Reunion </h3>Away from the restaurant, Strange revealed that she would have found him sooner if Casey hadn't mis-spelt his name when searching on the internet.  Strange was also startled by Casey's continued use of magic.  He had intended for his spell on her glasses to wear off after a few hours, and was shocked to learn that she'd handed the lenses from such important glasses to the clerk in a beauty parlor purely to have them set into more attractive frames.  However, Strange was more alarmed by how Casey could still use his 'Vanishing Spell' when she said that she was \"getting good at it\". Strange hadn't expected Casey to continue using magic.  She was a natural, and it surprised him.  However, because the spell was only meant to be used once, he had never taken the time to explain the repercussions.  The spell wasn't actually a 'Vanishing Spell'.  It was a 'Relocation Spell', which sent the items into a different dimension.  The keeper of that dimension had grown angry with Strange in the past, and therefore Strange made a pact never to use it again.  Because the pact had inadvertently been broken, all the items that Casey had 'vanished' and hideous monsters began to rain down on the city streets. <br/><h3>Another Dimension </h3>Casey tried the only thing she knew, but the spell wouldn't make the monsters disappear.  She asked Strange to teleport them away, but he refused since they had to deal with the mess she'd accidentally created.  So Casey turned her spell on themselves; making herself &amp; Strange teleport to the dimension where she had been sending all the lost items. Instantly the change in gravity &amp; the putrid smell hit her, and Casey threw up.  Strange seemed unaffected and greeted Baroshtok, the guardian of that dimension.  Baroshtok was furious, but Strange managed to calm him.  He introduced Casey as the lost little princess her cousins had treated her as.  He explained that she had lost everything when her granddad passed away, and that despite being lonely she still maintained courage &amp; was seeking new purpose.  The ogre agreed to forgive them, and instantly sent them home. <br/><h3>The Sorcerer's Apprentice </h3>Arriving in a dark back alley, Casey was moved by Strange's description of her to Baroshtok.  She was surprised by how he'd called her brave.  However, he didn't hear her as he was busy throwing rubbish out of his way in frustration at his own lack of power.  Strange apologised, and acted surprised when Casey asked what they were going to do next; implying that they would be together for a while to come.  She was aware that she couldn't unlearn the Vanishing Spell, and that Strange wasn't going to let her walk around causing chaos again. Strange stood up off the alley floor, and re-affirmed what Casey was saying; that magic would run amok unless she focused.  He then revealed the same logo on the floor from the baseball pitch and began a teleportal to New York.  Casey was more concerned about going back to her hotel room to have a hot shower &amp; collect her Vuitton luggage.  However, Strange pulled her into the teleportal.  Casey screamed as she was spirited to New York.<br/>    <br/> <h2>Powers &amp; Skills <br/></h2> <h3>Magic </h3>Although Doctor Strange described Casey as a natural, to date she had only performed the same spell over &amp; over.  However, he obviously trusted her enough to teach her the spell, which she successfully used a second time without any coaching. <br/><h3>Vanishing Spell</h3> Doctor Strange taught Casey a 'Vanishing Spell'.  Although he didn't reveal to her at the time that was what he called it, or the repercussions of repeated use of the spell.  Technically the spell doesn't make things disappear; it relocates items to another dimension.  Casey was able to use the spell on a variety of items including small cellular telephones and something as large as a removals van.<br/> <h3>IT Literate </h3>Casey clearly knows how to use her 3G phone, and as such is also likely to be aware of other modern technology, including computers.<br/> <br/> <h2>Personality</h2>Author <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40724\" href=\"/mark-waid/4040-40724/\" slug=\"mark-waid\">   Mark Waid</a> has described Casey as a stubborn &amp; argumentative college girl who is hard to teach.  She has demonstrated a strong familial love, and loyalty to new friends.  However, she hides behind a brash facade, and can seem rude when she forgets names.",
