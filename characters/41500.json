At the age of 14, Triple H got involved in bodybuilding. He was informed of Killer Kowalski’s school by his work out partner, Ted Arcidi. Ted had a brief wrestling career and was at one time the bench press record holder. Triple H was trained by Killer Kowalski and made his pro debut in 1992. He is currently married to <a href=\"/stephanie-mcmahon/4005-97612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-97612\">Stephanie McMahon</a> and is the son-in-law of <a href=\"/vince-mcmahon/4005-92441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92441\">Vince McMahon</a>. Growing up he idolized <a href=\"/ric-flair/4005-10166/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10166\">Ric Flair</a>, Over the course of his career, he has had a few injuries resulting in being sidelined for a little over a year. He has 14 World titles reigns, still in pursuit of his mentor (Ric Flair) who has 16. He has led D-X and Evolution, which has been very successful. <a href=\"/randy-orton/4005-92434/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92434\">Randy Orton</a>, and <a href=\"/batista/4005-92436/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92436\">Batista</a> have held numerous titles thanks to Triple H. Triple H has won the Intercontinental championship five times, is a three time tag team champion (twice with <a href=\"/shawn-michaels/4005-92440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92440\">Shawn Michaels</a> and once with <a href=\"/stone-cold-steve-austin/4005-48572/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48572\">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a>) and has won the now defunct Europeon Title twice.</p><h2>D-X</h2><p>D-X is short for Degeneration X. The group was founded by Triple H (at the time he was called Hunter Hearst Helmsley), his valet <a href=\"/chyna/4005-48524/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48524\">Chyna</a> and the Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels. They were an anti-establishment group that feuded with the Hart Dynasty (a group that consisted of <a href=\"/the-hitman/4005-63701/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63701\">Bret Hart</a>, Owen Hart, the British Bulldog, Jim 'The Anvil' Neidhart, and Brian Pillman) and Stone Cold Steve Austin. After Wrestlemania 14, Shawn Michaels left the group after having 'lost his smile' (he actually had a serious back injury). Triple H assumed leadership of the group and increased the ranks of the group by adding X-Pac (who was previously called Syxx in WCW and the 1-2-3 Kid in WWE) and the New Age Outlaws, a tag team that included 'Bad Ass' Billy Gunn (a former member of the Tag Team 'The Smoking Gunns' with his 'brother' Bart Gunn) and 'The Road Dog' Jesse James (he was formerly the roadie for Jeff Jarrett). Later the group added Stephanie McMahon and Torrie. This group tended to feud with Vince McMahon, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Nation of Domination (<a href=\"/the-rock/4005-35745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35745\">The Rock</a>, the <a href=\"/charles-wright/4005-116049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-116049\">Godfather</a>, <a href=\"/mark-henry/4005-92433/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92433\">Mark Henry</a>, D-Lo Brown and Owen Hart). Eventually the group fell apart when Triple H and Stephanie McMahon joined the Corporation. A few years later the two original members, Triple H and Shawn Michaels, reunited as a tag-team and won the unified tag team titles. The duo broke up when <a href=\"/undertaker/4005-48570/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48570\">Undertaker</a> forced Shawn Michaels to retire. The group returns occasionally as a nostalgia act.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>Evolution was a Four Horseman style group that was founded by Triple H and Ric Flair and consisted of them, Randy Orton and Batista. The group slowly fell apart from jealousy and mistrust. First Randy Orton defeated Chris Benoit for the Heavyweight title to become the youngest World Heavyweight Champion ever at the time. Triple H then violently kicked Orton out of the group over his jealousy of Orton having the title. Later on when Batista won the Royal Rumble, Triple H feared that Batista would challenge him for his title, so Triple H attacked him first. Later on, Triple H ruthlessly attack Ric Flair hoping to put the legend out permanently.</p><h2>Quasi-Retirement</h2><p>Currently Triple H is out of action. Triple H was defeated by <a href=\"/brock-lesnar/4005-95843/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-95843\">Brock Lesnar</a> via submission, breaking his arm again. There is much speculation that his in-ring career may be over. On the August 27th episode of Raw, Triple H announced he was unsure of his future, although on an article on WWE.com, it was stated that the speech given that night was in fact a farewell speech. Several months later Triple H returned to the ring and viciously attacked Brock Lesner. This was in retaliation for Lesner's attack of Vince McMahon (Triple H's father in-law and boss) which forced McMahon to have hip replacement surgery. They then had a No Holds Barred match at Wrestlemania. Triple H defeated Brock Lesner by pinfall. At Wrestlemania 31, Triple H wrestled against <a href=\"/sting/4005-63696/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63696\">Sting</a>, who finally had joined WWE. Triple H won, thanks to interference by his former teammates from D-X.</p>",

Eleven years since a fortunate stroke of luck sent the young woman tripping over a dead zombie, and out of the grasp of a dozen blood-thirsty ghouls. Barbara was there when Ben was mistakenly shot by the search and rescue team the following morning. She had hoped to bring help to the farmhouse, but instead brought even more death and destruction. Now, in 1981, Barbara and a rag-tag band of survivors have secured themselves inside of a compound fortified by chain-link fences and barbed wire. Barbara still struggles with nightmares of the horror and violence of that evening so many years before, unable to put the past behind her, and move on.</p><p> </p><p>Following a routine scouting mission in a nearby town for food and supplies,</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093405-lastscan2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093405\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4132492113565\" data-width=\"317\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 317px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093405-lastscan2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093405\"><img alt=\"Barbara the Warrior\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093405-lastscan2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093405-lastscan2.jpg 317w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" data-width=\"317\"></a><figcaption>Barbara the Warrior</figcaption></figure><p>Barbara and her group discover that the living dead have used themselves as as a ramp, enabling them to climb atop one another in order to enter the compound. There is nothing but devastation as far as the eye can see, and Barbara's group proceeds to eliminate the zombies. They find that the remaining survivors barricaded themselves inside of the compound's mess hall, and turned their weapons on themselves, to avoid being eaten alive. It is almost too much for Barbara to bear, and she points her pistol to her temple, preparing to end her life. Before she can pull the trigger, however, Barbara hears the cries of a little girl hiding atop a statue in what used to be the compound's \"town square\", and rushes to the child's aid.</p><p> </p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093888-b2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093888\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.72715736040609\" data-width=\"788\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 788px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093888-b2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093888\"><img alt=\"Laura Is Murdered\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" data-width=\"788\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093888-b2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093888-b2.jpg 788w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1093888-b2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Laura Is Murdered\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093888-b2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1093888-b2.jpg 788w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1093888-b2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" data-width=\"788\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Laura Is Murdered</figcaption></figure><p>With little left to lose, Barbara informs the survivors that they are heading to a compound in <a href=\"/washington-dc/4020-55685/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55685\"> Washington D.C.</a>, where it is rumored by survivor Dr. Peter Cooke that there are drugs that can slow, and even stop, the infection.

She has a rather slender and somewhat tall body marked with scars and stitches from her time as a human experiment. However, Shiro does not appear to have the extreme sensitivity to sunlight that most people afflicted with albinism suffer; this is perhaps a side effect of the experiments she underwent.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When the Shiro persona is dominant, she wears a skintight jumpsuit decorated with several red spirals resembling bulls-eyes, and a small neck brace. Whether the brace is necessary or just an odd fashion choice is unknown. The brace could be a collar, not dissimilar to those worn by the other inmates at Deadman Wonderland. When Shiro's personality is replaced by that of the Wretched Egg, her clothing is concealed by armor based off Aceman, a cartoon superhero from her shared childhood with Ganta.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p>",

    "description": "<h3>History </h3> <h3>Before Season 1 </h3><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb38587/common/skins/common/blank.gif\"/>Jason was born to Mr. and Mrs. Stackhouse a few years earlier than his sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-68507\" href=\"/sookie-stackhouse/4005-68507/\" slug=\"sookie-stackhouse\">Sookie</a>. When he was 11 years old both his parents died in a flash flood, causing him and his sister to have to move in with their grandmother Adele Stackhouse. When Jason was 18, he moved back into his child hood home, even though his gran wanted him to stay with her. Jason left high school and did not go to college as he failed to earn a scholarship from playing football, he got a job on the road crew where he is Supervisor and became friends with René Lenier, Hoyt Fortenberry and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71912\" href=\"/lafayette-reynolds/4005-71912/\" slug=\"lafayette-reynolds\">Lafayette Reynolds</a>. Jason also began to date Dawn Green although he stopped calling her after he got  <h3>Season 1</h3> <p>While having sex with Maudette Pickens, Jason becomes rough and starts to choke her and she falls unconscious, Jason then runs out of her apartment leaving Maudette tied up, she was found dead later the next day. Believing he had killed her Jason spent the next day worried and wondering when the police would come for him. </p> <p>After the police found the sex tape of Jason and Maudette they questioned Jason and he admitted to killing her believing he had choked her to death, however at the end of the tape Maudette unties her self and laughs after Jason left her apartment, showing he didn't kill her. After spending the day believing he had killed someone and thrown his life away Jason sought comfort with Dawn Green, his former girlfriend. </p>The two began to have sex again, After Jason discovered that Dawn had had sex with a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55796\" href=\"/vampires/4015-55796/\" slug=\"vampires\">vampire</a> he was at first disgusted at Dawn but stopped criticizing her in order to have sex with her. The two began to have a relationship for around a week until one night when Jason was over he could no longer get an erection and Dawn threw him out of her apartment threatening him with a gun at the time. Jason went to Lafayette to buy viagra so he could maintain an erection however Lafayette said instead of Viagra he needed V because it would work better. The next day Dawn was found dead by Jason was the prime suspect in the Bon Temps murders as he had just had sex with both the victims before their deaths.  <br/>Jason was arrested and while in the cop car he realized he had V on his person which was illegal so he drank the whole vial, however more than one or two drops will cause adverse effects. While in the police station Jason developed an enhanced erection which would not go down, he began to panic as Andy demanded he came out of the bathroom Tara came to Jason's aid and demanded if Andy could not charge him with anything he had no choice but to let him go. Jason went to the hospital and was given the antidote to V overdose, blood drained out of his penis. The next big event for Jason was the death of his gran and his new found addiction to V.  <p>While looking for a new place to buy V Jason found himself in Fangtasia were he met Amy a young woman who was also a V addict, although like Jason did not think of herself as one. The two began a relationship and for several weeks were very happy, this is until they ran out of V and resorted to kidnapping Eddie Gauthier for his blood. Jason bonded with the vampire and they became friends, the vampire then manipulated Jason into letting him go, however Amy staked the vampire before he could kill Jason and Amy. Jason was very upset by this and told Amy that they were no longer going to do V, Amy agreed and they threw it all out, apart from enough for one more high. While they were high on V, Drew Marshall killed Amy because he thought she had sex with vampires for their blood. </p> <p>Jason thought he had killed her while on his V high and confessed to her murder along with Maudette and Dawn. Once it was revealed that Drew Marshall was the real killer, Jason was let go. He was still distraught and confused by the events which that had happened to him. He sought answers about his recent experiences from the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57243\" href=\"/fellowship-of-the-sun/4060-57243/\" slug=\"fellowship-of-the-sun\">Fellowship Of The Sun</a>, a vampire-hating church. </p> <h3>Season 2<a href=\"http://trueblood.wikia.com/index.php?title=Jason_Stackhouse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb38587/common/skins/common/blank.gif\"/></a></h3> <p>Jason joins the Fellowship of the Sun. Realizing his potential, the leaders of the Fellowship tell him about the Light of Day Institute, a \"Leadership Summit\" for the church's most reverent members. He also meets a man named Luke, and the two become friends. After Sookie gives him the inheritance from their Uncle Bartlett (which is more than enough for the L.O.D.I. summit) he joins the church and quickly becomes the best member, not only with his show stopping performance in a mock debate but also with his great accuracy with a paintball gun. During a meeting, he reveals his sister's relationship with a vampire and his friendship with Eddie, as well as the emotional stress caused by Drew \"René\" Marshall to his life. He leaves the meeting, but is followed by Sarah Newlin, the wife of the Church's leader Steve. She explains that she once thought vampires were good too, and she understands how he must feel. </p>As Jason becomes better, Sarah Newlin becomes even more attracted to him, eventually allowing him to sleep in her house and giving him a hand job in the bath tub . Jason and his friend Luke, who is becoming jealous of him, are told to build a giant cross, which Luke says is for making a vampire \"meet the sun\". During this time, Sookie is captured and thrown in the dungeon, deeply upsetting Sarah. She confides in Jason, and the two have sex in the church . The next day, Sookie's real identity is revealed to Steve, and he takes Jason into the woods with the drill sergeant. He tells the sergeant, Gabe, to kill him, but Jason quickly overpowers and defeats the sergeant when he learns that his sister is being held captive. to reclaim his town the church. It is after nightfall when Sarah finds him, having been told of his supposed treachery by Steve. She shoots him with a paintball gun (which he first believes is real, then thinks that he has been brought back to life). She then shoots him in the groin, causing him to fall in pain. However, when she calls his sister a whore, he becomes enraged and knocks away Sarah, stealing her vehicle and returning to the L.O.D.I. with paintball gun in hand. <br/> <p>At the L.O.D.I., Godric has been freed, but Eric offers himself in his place. Jason bluffs his way into the Church, saying he is a highly trained vampire killer called in for the toughest jobs. He knocks out the guards and continues into the main church, where Steve has a gun to Sookie. Jason shoots the gun out of Steve's hand with his paintball gun, and then shoots Steve in the head, causing him to fall over. The other Dallas vampires then appear and end the standoff. </p> <p>Later at the Dallas vampire nest, Jason receives recognition as a hero. He also apologizes to Bill and Sookie for joining the L.O.D.I.. While at the nest, he sees Luke walk inside and is immediately suspicious. However, Luke pushes him away and into the other room before detonating the bombs strapped to his chest. Jason is not harmed in the explosion, as he was in the kitchen. He is later in his hotel room and sees that Steve (on TV) still has a mark where Jason shot him in the head, and that his marriage isn't as strong as it once was. He also helps to comfort his sister. </p>Sookie, Bill, and Jason return to Bon Temps to find the town in chaos. Hearing that San and Andy are in trouble, Jason goes to Merlotte's to help them, and tricks the townsfolk into thinking he is the god they worship. He pretends to smite Sam, who turns into a fly with his clothes on scaring the townsfolk along with Jason and Andy. After Sam's escape, Jason and Andy ignoring Sam’s advice that Maryann cannot be stopped with violence, they go to the police station to arm themselves. They advance on the crowd outside Sookie's house with an arsenal of weaponry, but become quickly entranced themselves.  <p>After Maryann's death, a distraught Eggs holds Andy Bellefleur at knife-point begging to be arrested. Andy tries to explain that all of his actions were not of his own free will, but Jason, seeing the hold-up from afar, does not realize what is happening and shoots Eggs. Jason is afraid after realizing he killed Eggs, but Andy takes his gun, wipes it off and tells Jason to leave and that \"he was not here and he didn't see anything.\"  <br/></p>   <h3>Season 3 </h3>Andy sends Jason home while he talks to the Police and takes the blame for Eggs death, and later sneaks into Jason's house, and tells him that he must be the Jason everyone expects him to be, which means picking up chicks. Later that day, Jason does just that, bringing two girls back to his house. Every time he looks at them, he pictures them with bullet holes in their heads, which means he can't perform. The girls leave in a rush after Jason explains that \"it's not you, it's just I keep picturing you both with big 'ol bullet holes in your foreheads\".  <p>The next day Jason visit's his sister and they clean the kitchen Sookie tells Jason about the werewolves and the fact she feels helpless about Bill's disappearance. Jason tells her she doesn't have to worry that he thinks Andy might be able to help. Andy takes Jason to Merlotte's, and as they sit a glowing story about Andy comes on the TV. A drunken Jason stands up and toasts Andy. Jason seems upset that Andy is being treated like a hero for taking credit for his murder. Andy tells Jason he thinks he has potential. Jason tells Andy he is his best friend. Later that night Andy drives Jason home from the bar. He gets a call that a meth lab is being busted and takes Jason along. At the scene Jason spots a strange woman in the woods. He asks if she is okay and she disappears. Jason walks back to the car and ends up tackling one of the drug dealers.  </p>In light of his performance at the meth bust, Jason decides he want to become a police officer. To pass the written test for the job, he has Hoyt quiz him, but the preparation isn`t going well. The next day, while \"working\"on the road crew, Jason falls asleep in his truck and has an anxious nightmare about taking his test. Even worse, he wakes up to Hoyt`s screams after his friend finds a headless body in the ditch they`re digging. After work, Jason heads over to Merlotte`s where he offers his support to Tara, wishing he could just come clean about his responsibility for Eggs`death. At Merlotte's, Jason learns about Kitch Maynard, the town's cocky high school quarterback who is poised to break all of Jason's records. During Bud's retirement party, he introduces Andy as the new acting chief of police. Jason and Kitch have a run-in where Jason warns the youngster that down the road he will be replaced by the next hotshot. Jason tells Andy he wants to be made a cop immediately, and threatens to tell what really happened to Eggs if Andy doesn't comply.  <br/>Andy gets Jason a job at the police department as a receptionist. Jason is completely bored by the job and proceeds to try and entertain himself while using office supplies. Andy tells him to go wash the cop cars. Jason sees the same woman from the meth bust driving a truck pass the police department. He jumps into a car and follows her and eventually pulls her over. He is only in his pants with a pair of sunglasses. He tries to convince her that he is a cop but she doesn't buy it. He tells her his name and asks for hers. She tells him her name is Crystal Norris. He tells her that he will be at Merlotte's that night but she tells him she can't go and drives away without a ticket.  <p>Jason goes to Merlotte's after work and waits there for her. Andy tells him that he can be a cop as soon as he takes the test. Jason is extremely reluctant to take the test because he's afraid he'll fail it. Andy tries to encourage him but Jason ends up walking out of Merlotte's. He sees Crystal and they sneak off to a secluded area next to a lake or pond. They make out and flirt but eventually Crystal says she can't do it and runs off. The next day, Jason finds out where she lives and brings her flowers. She pretends she doesn't know who he is and Jason finds out that she is engaged to a low-life. He leaves and goes to Merlotte's, where he is almost crashed into by Sam Merlotte. Jason then spots Kitch Maynard having sex with a girl in Kitch's car. Jason gets Kitch out of the car and threatens him yet again. </p>Jason is very bummed out about Crystal being engaged and he speaks to Hoyt, his roommate, about it a day or so after he had found out. Hoyt told him to ask the meth dealer at the jail about Crystal. Jason likes this idea and he goes to the jail to talk to the drug dealer. Jason finds out that Crystal is the dealer's cousin but he gets nothing more out of the dealer. The dealer tells him that he can get all of the information if he gets some meth for the dealer. Jason goes to Lafayette to get some meth but Lafayette refuses. Their conversation is cut short when Tara calls Jason and tells him that Sookie is in the hospital. Jason and Lafayette leave for the hospital together.  <p>Tara tells them that Bill is the one who attacked Sookie and that Sookie doesn't have a blood-type, therefore her body won't accept any blood. While Jason is visiting, a woman tries to convince him to pull the plug. Jason says that he is not responsible, despite the fact that he is the next of kin. Lafayette chases her off though. Jason tells Tara and Lafayette that Sookie has never been to a hospital before, unlike himself. He admits that she wasn't even born in a hospital because his mother was a procrastinator. Jason and Tara plead to an unconscious Sookie, asking her to stay with them, and Lafayette prays over her. </p> <p>When night falls, Bill arrives and offers to help bring Sookie back. Tara and Lafayette don't want him there but Jason let's Bill give Sookie his blood. Tara objects to this but Jason tells her that it is his decision. They all fall asleep in the hospital room, including Alcide. Bill remains at Sookie's side and waits for her to wake up. When she does, she screams. Later on, Jason goes to the aide of Hot Shot. He knows Crystal is a werepanther now, and he knows the DEA is going to bust their makeshift town apart. He arrives at Hot Shot, but when the people don't leave, and Crystal has no choice to, Jason stays behind to help them alone. </p> <h2>Notable Skills &amp; Abilities <a href=\"http://trueblood.wikia.com/index.php?title=Jason_Stackhouse&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb38587/common/skins/common/blank.gif\"/></a></h2> <p>While Jason did not inherit powers as his sister,he does carry the blood of his fae ancestor, which makes him more attractive to women and gay men. As a former football star, Jason is very athletic - he's tough and usually will win in a fight. He proves he is capable of shooting a paintball gun, pistol or rifle with great accuracy. He is also quite brave and outspoken. </p>",

    "deck": "Tara Mae Thornton has been Sookie Stackhouse's best friend since childhood,and the cousin of Lafayette Reynolds. Tara is a strong-willed person who has had to deal with a multitude of abuses in her life. She formerly worked for Sam Merlotte as a bartender at  Merlotte's, Now a MMA Fighter.",
    "description": "<h2>History in the Southern Vampires Series</h2><p>In Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampires series, the base material for the HBO Alan Ball hit, which is the basis for these comics, Tara is Sookie's best friend since grade school.  In the books, she's white, her only involvement with the vampires was in book 3 she got involved with a vamp which she cut off after seeing what they're really like.  She runs a dress shop, is married to J.B. DuRone and has twin babies.  And she had no relationship to Lafayette.  Her only involvement with the shapeshifter/werewolf society was a brief fling with Sam, when he was her boss.</p><h2>History in the True Blood Universe</h2><h2>Season 1</h2><p>Tara's home life has been less than perfect. As a child, she would often stay at Sookie's grandmother's house, in order to escape her abusive, alcoholic mother, Lettie Mae. As an adult, Tara finds herself taking care of drunken Lettie Mae on a regular basis, so she decides to leave her mother and move in with her cousin Lafayette Reynolds. That is, until she finds web cams hidden in his bathroom. Tara then moves into a small room at the Bon Temp Motel.</p><p>She moved back in with her mother to help \"cure\" her of a demon she claims to be controlled by. The two travel to nearby woods where they encounter Miss Jeanette. The woman claims she can heal Lettie Mae and begins a demon exorcism. Soon after, Lettie Mae believes her demons have been expelled; and, fearing her own are getting the best of her, Tara has an exorcism herself. Tara soon believes she is also cured. Tara visits a Pharmacy and discovers Miss Jeanette working as a clerk.</p><p>She realizes she was a sham and a con-artist and goes off the deep end. Driving drunk one night, she swerves to miss a nude woman and a pig in the road; she is arrested by Officer Kenya Jones. Tara's mother refuses to bail her out of jail and kicks her out of the house. Maryann Forrester arrives at the Bon Temps Police Station and not only makes Tara's bail, but also offers her a place to stay at her immaculate house<u>.</u></p><h2>Season 2</h2><p>Tara stays at Maryann's temporary home for about a month. Then Tara moves in to Sookie's house until she can get fully squared away with her problems. When the real owner of the estate comes back from Peru, Maryann leaves the estate and convinces Tara to let her stay at Sookie's house.</p><p>A few days later Tara and Eggs are sent on a two hour drive to a nearby town to pick up a part for the house's broken water heater. On the way there, Eggs somehow knows what is coming around the next turn and he tells Tara to stop the car so he can investigate. They enter the woods and keep going for about a mile. They see a small area where large rocks are arranged in a circle. Eggs begins to freak out knowing he's been there but having no recollection of actually being there.</p><p>He soon notices blood covering some of the rocks. (He was most likely there during one of Maryann's orgy parties.) They soon leave the area.</p><p>The following night, Tara and Eggs return to the Stackhouse residence and discover the house littered with trash and a trail of clothes. They follow the trail which leads them to an orgy being hosted by none other than Maryann. Tara appears interested at Maryann's vibrating and dancing before both her and Eggs are taken under her control. When Sam is brought with the help of Daphne, Tara convinces him to just 'give in' to Maryann's influence before joining the crowd in dancing wildly ( Hard-Hearted Hannah).</p><p>The following day, Tara and Eggs regain consciousness on the couch and have no memory of what took place last night, except for finding the trail of clothes. While they're watching a movie, Maryann returns to Sookie's house with bloody feet and a dead rabbit. She asks Maryann about the mess and tells her that she cannot do whatever she wants in Sookie's house but Maryann distracts her with her compliments.</p><p>Now at Merlottes', Arlene interrupts Tara and Eggs kissing and they retreat to the bathroom to talk in private, only to find Lafayette putting on his makeup. After he leaves, Arlene informs Tara that she blacked out and has no memory of last night (also theorizing that she raped Terry, her boyfriend) and Tara realizes that she also cannot remember what happened. Andy comes in, with a broken arm and a fury that he's saving for Terry, and shouts at the bar patrons, knowing that he saw them last night and that they turned Bon Temps into \"Orgy from Hell\" before leaving. The bar patrons laugh at his seeming-to-be crazy action although Sam is the only one that knows that Andy is telling the truth.</p><p>Tara remains at Merlottes with Lafayette who is predicting her future with cards. Eggs abruptly comes in, shaken and worried. He informs her that he blacked out again (this is because Maryann takes Eggs under her control so she could use him to kill Daphne and cut out her heart). Tara takes Eggs home while Lafayette remains suspicious of Eggs.</p><p>In an attempt to make Eggs feel better, Maryann makes a hunter souflee (a dish with the main ingredient being Daphne's heart) for them. Eggs and Tara eagerly inhale the delicious meal before Maryann begins using her influence on them again, causing one another to mercilessly and delightfully slap and punch each other.</p><p>Tara and Eggs, with multiple bruises, enter Merlotte's and Lafayette instantly notices his cousin's bruises. He automatically blames Eggs when Tara says she cannot remember (which she can't) though Lafayette isn't buying it. Lafayette are about to engage in a fight but Tara leaves with Eggs. Eggs, Tara, and Maryann are then playing a no-rule game of poker when Lafayette and Lettie Mae interrupt. They demand for Tara to come with them but Tara refuses. Maryann then takes control of Tara again and while she is fighting her mother, Lafayette is fighting Eggs. Seizing the opportunity, Lafayette grabs Tara and stuffs his screaming cousin into his car before him and his aunt take Tara to his house .</p><p>Tara begins to chant the words Maryann was thinking and saying earlier in Season 2 which annoys Lafayette enough to slap his cousin. Lettie Mae and Lafayette blame themselves for Tara's involvement with Maryann's powers before Lafayette calls Sookie, who is back in Bon Temps and in her house to find Tara, to come to his house to help Tara. Both her and Bill leave, though not before confronting Maryann who has claimed Sookie's house as her own.</p><p>Sookie and Bill arrive at Lafayette's house and they use their combined powers to release Tara from Maryann's supernatural influence. Sookie also sees the recent chain of events Tara engaged in while Sookie was in Dallas. Tara, now free from Maryann's powers, cries for her mother and embraces both Lafayette and her mother before realizing that Eggs is still in danger. When she attempts to make a run for it, Lafayette stops her.</p><p>Tara tactfully uses her mother's faith in Jesus to her advantage and is able to leave for Eggs. When she arrives at Sookie's house, she finds Eggs still under Maryann's influence and tries to convince him to leave with her, although Eggs appears confused. Maryann then confronts Tara and tells her that she summoned her to Bon Temps by Miss Jeanette's ritual. This ritual, though not meant to be real, actually called the maenad to the town. Tara, resenting Maryann's kindness and pleading for Eggs and her release, annoys Maryann to the point where she'll simply regain control over her. This proves to be unsuccessful since Tara is concentrated on her and prevents her influence from possessing her. This, however, doesn't last long when Maryann punches Tara which breaks her focus and she is under her control again. That same night, Sookie returns to her house to search for Tara and finds both Tara and Eggs decorating a nest with an ostrich egg in the center. Sookie screams upon seeing Lafayette also under Maryann's control .</p><p>Tara appears to be a bridesmaid for Maryann along with Arlene and Jane Bodehouse. Tara also places the ostrich egg into the space on the statue of meat. When Sookie destroys both the egg and knocks over the statue, Maryann begins vibrating again and is mentally hurting the possessed Bon Temps residents before the angered maenad chases Sookie into the woods. Once Maryann is killed by the plan Sam and Bill orchestrated, everyone is no longer under Maryann's control. Tara tries to calm down a confused and scared Eggs, who's hands are bloody. Tara apologizes for allowing Maryann to move in and tells Sookie of her reasons but Sookie assures her that they're family.</p><p>The next day, the bar patrons are talking about their suspicions of last night but everything else seems to go back to normal. Later that night, Eggs confronts Andy with a murder weapon (a large hunting knife that's the same one he used on Miss Jeanette, Daphne Landry, and Sam Merlotte). He received this information with the help of Sookie's telepathy. Eggs begins getting violent and Jason fires his gun, fatally shooting Eggs in the head. The gunshot is heard and the bar patrons, along with Tara, go out to see the commotion. Tara instantly breaks down at the sight of Eggs and begins crying and shouting in denial .</p><h2>Season 3</h2><p>After Eggs Talley is accidentally killed by <a href=\"/jason-stackhouse/4005-68625/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68625\">Jason Stackhouse</a> after Maryann's death, Tara becomes increasingly distraught and depressed. After finding out that Sookie used her telepathy to help Eggs remember what he did during the blackouts that Maryann caused, Tara was at a point close to choking Sookie with her bare hands. Only by Lafayette's interference, Tara was prevented from killing her best friend. After Lattie Mae invited a preacher to console Tara during her ordeal, Tara their first tryst.</p><p>However, while Lattie Mae was distracted, Tara proceeded to swallow several bottles of pills in a attempt to commit suicide. Soon, Tara gets involved in a love affair with vampire Franklin Mott.</p><p>He saved her from two rednecks in Merlotte's parking lot and the two have sex. Franklin glamors her for information about Sookie and then takes her to Jackson, Mississippi and keeps her hostage in the King's mansion. Tara escapes by bludgeoning Franklin's head with a mace. Tara and Sookie escape the mansion together but split up so Sookie can find Bill and Tara can find a car. While she's trying to find a way to get off of the property, she meets Alcide for the first time.</p><p>She and Alcide get his truck and find Sookie in the \"slave quarters\". Tara thinks Bill is officially dead but Sookie explains that he would look like Lorena (who was a puddle of goo at that point). Tara is disgusted by what she sees while Sookie starts to removed the silver manacles and chains from</p><p>Debbie Pelt walks in with a hand gun and points it at Alcide. Alcide tries to talk Debbie down but fails after Sookie calls her a bitch. Tara speaks to Sookie telepathically and tells her to do something to distract Debbie. Sookie says no at first but Tara encourages her and Sookie screams. Debbie becomes distracted and Tara attacks her and slams her against a wall, because Tara drank so much vampire blood her stamina and strength were enhanced. Alcide grabs the gun just as Cooter comes in.</p><p>After Alcide locks Debbie in the shack, Tara and Sookie roll Bill up and carry him out to the truck. Sookie stays with Bill in the back while Tara and Alcide get into the front. As they are leaving, Alcide runs over another wolf. Tara is surprised by this. After they get out and are a ways away from the mansion, Alcide tells Tara to breath. Eventually they pull over so Alcide can relieve himself and Tara checks on Sookie. Sookie never answers to Tara's bangs on the back door of the truck.</p><p>Tara opens the back of the truck and is shocked to see that Sookie is unconscious and bleeding. Tara kicks Bill out of the truck and she cradles Sookie while Alcide closes the door and drives off without Bill.</p><p>Tara and Alcide wait in the waiting room of the hospital and eventually are told by a doctor that Sookie is in a coma and does not have a blood-type. Tara calls Jason to tell him about Sookie and When Jason and Lafayette arrive, Tara tells them that Sookie was attacked by Bill and that she has no blood-type. Eventually Bill arrives at the hospital and Tara is livid and shocked.</p><p>When Jason decides to let Bill give Sookie his blood, Tara objects but Jason tells her that it is his decision. After a while, Tara falls asleep against Jason while they wait for Sookie to wake up.</p><p>After Sookie recovers, Lafayette takes care of Tara and asks her is she still has suicidal tendencies. Tara reveals that she has never realized how much she wants to live. She remains troubled after her experience with Franklin and argues with Sookie about Bill. Back at <a href=\"/merlottes-bar-and-grill/4020-56630/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56630\">Merlotte's,</a> she spills a bottle of Tru Blood which triggers a memory of Franklin. Sam finds her crying and hugs her, and warns Tommy not to approach Tara.</p><p>Tara then finds comfort in Sam Merlotte again. He reveals to her that he is a shapeshifter. He then tells her that there are ways of escaping your life. She then proceeds to leave but not after seeing her mother, seeing Sookie and cutting off all her hair.</p><h3>Season 4</h3><p>It is revealed that Tara is now living in New Orleans and has become a boxer. Tara is now in a relationship with Naomi, a woman and fellow boxer. While in bed together, Tara receives a text from Lafayette saying Sookie is home.

She is best known as the goddess, who on being snubbed by the gods on mount Olympus sought revenge by rolling a golden apple into among the inscribed “Kallisti” (To the Prettiest One) which led to a conflict between three goddesses about which one of them should get it. This led to Zeus passing the buck to the human Paris to make the choice, which eventually led to the Trojan War. </p><p> </p><p>After this she appears in few other myths. </p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><p> The goddess Discord/Discordia however has made quite a few appearances both in comics, in various adaptations of the Iliad, as a super heroine who sometimes helped Diana, the Huntress in her series in the 40s in Yellowjacket Comics, as a regular villainess (under a different name) at Marvel and DC, some independent comics written by Discordians (modern day “worshipers” of Discordia) and as a recurring animation character on the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Nick is a detective from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-47879\" href=\"/coast-city/4020-47879/\" slug=\"coast-city\">Coast City</a>. He recently transferred to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\" href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" slug=\"gotham-city\">Gotham City</a> and works alongside <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\" href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" slug=\"james-gordon\">Commissioner James Gordon</a>. He has only been in Gotham for a short period of time and has already had a shocking number of arrests and convictions. They call him \"St. Nick\" because he is the best Christmas present the Commissioner has ever gotten. He is kind of like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1701\" href=\"/batgirl/4005-1701/\" slug=\"batgirl\">Batgirl</a>'s Commissioner Gordon and has somewhat of a romantic interest in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\" href=\"/oracle/4005-5368/\" slug=\"oracle\">Barbara Gordon</a></p><h2>Creation</h2><p>He was created by Bryan Q. Miller in 2010</p><h2>Major Arcs</h2><p><strong>Crime doesn't Clay</strong></p><p>In Gotham's financial district, Detective Nick Gage acts as the police negotiator while talking to Mr. Griswald, the crazed husband who is held up in his van. Gage tries to talk Griswald down and have him come out of the van. Unfortunately, Gage's task force comes under unsuspecting fire and the SWAT team is called in to retaliate. As the SWAT team approaches the van, Griswald throws a petrol can that bursts causing everything and everyone to go up in flames. Gage was in safe distance from the explosion and spots Griswald running from the van.</p><p>Gage still tries to convince Griswald in turning himself in but Griswald refuses to acknowledge Gage as they make their way to the roof of a building. The pursuit ends when Griswald has no adjacent roof top to jump to and Gage holds him at gunpoint. However, Griswald seems unfazed by the gun as he causes himself to explode into a mountain of clay. The explosion sends Gage flying off the building but as he fell, Stephanie swoops down to save Gage. The duo glide down to a nearby alleyway until Proxy informs Batgirl by via comm link that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9589\" href=\"/clayface-karlo/4005-9589/\" slug=\"clayface-karlo\">Clayface</a> has made his way to Gotham's Bank &amp; Trust.</p><p>After a huge scuffle with Clayface, Steph and Karlo end up outside the bank because of an explosion. When the smoke clears, Stephanie awakes unharmed since Clayface's body absorbed the impact of the explosion but she also discovers that there is another version of herself. Gage's task force doesn't know who to apprehend until one of the Batgirls orders Det. Gage to shoot the other Batgirl. Fortunately, the real Batgirl simply gave Gage the go ahead to fire at her. Gage soon realizes that only Clayface would ask him to shoot somebody. Clayface is exposed and Stephanie uses a batarang filled with liquid nitrogen to freeze Clayface. Clayface is sent back to Arkham Asylum while Det. Gage reveals the real reason why Clayface wanted to get inside the bank's vault.</p><p><strong>The Slipstream Lesson</strong></p><p>During the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74770\" href=\"/slipstream/4005-74770/\" slug=\"slipstream\">Slipstream</a> robberies, Gage arrives at Branch 19 of the Gotham Bank and Trust where a bizarre crime scene has just been committed. Stephanie eventually appears at the scene as Batgirl. Gage informs Batgirl that this is the third unusual bank robbery this week. The only damage to the bank was at the front door and the vault door. Gage and Batgirl also review the security feed from the bank’s closed circuit television. They soon recognize a blurry image that set off the pressure censor alarms in the bank.</p><p>They both figure Slipstream, a servant of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58280\" href=\"/the-reapers/4060-58280/\" slug=\"the-reapers\">Reaper</a> gang, intentionally set off the alarms to mock the decisive duo after their last encounter with the shadowy speedster. The security feed also reveals that Slipstream only stole a couple thousands of dollars and left millions more behind. Steph is curious as to why Gage is making this particular case a personal matter. She asks Gage if this case has anything to do with the murder of his ex-partner's son Nelson Flitwick. Gage just brushes off Steph's suspicions and leaves the crime scene. After Steph apprehended Slipstream, she hands Slipstream over to Det. Gage but Gage as well as Steph notice that Slipstream doesn't seem at all concerned that he is going to Blackgate.</p>",

Despite appearing seemingly dopey and slow-witted when performing his role, he is actually very perceptive. His appearance is based off of the male player character of Diamond and Pearl,    Lucas. His name is often shortened to Dia, but is also called by his full name, Diamond, by Pearl when the latter is unusually serious.   <br /> <br /><u>His Pokémon: </u><br />Munchlax <br />Bastiodon <br />Torterra <br />LickiLicky <br />Drifblim   <br />Mammoswine</p>",

Akatsuchi shows great concern for Ōnoki and offers to carry his luggage when his back gives out, Kurotsuchi however hassles Ōnoki for being too stubborn to retire and choose a successor. On the way to the Land of Iron, they asked him about where they were going and he explained that the Land of Iron is a neutral country but has a powerful military consisting of Samurais rather than Ninjas.</p><p>At the Kage summit, Ōnoki was a bit of a trouble maker, giving everyone a hard time, especially <a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\">Gaara</a>. Here it was revealed that Ōnoki had used <a href=\"/akatsuki/4060-45002/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45002\">Akatsuki</a> many times in the past, and blamed the Raikage for needing to do so since the Cloud village had been increasing their military power. When it was revealed that <a href=\"/danzo/4005-62677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62677\">Danzo</a> was trying to manipulate the vote to become the leader of their alliance, he and Danzo had a small conversation. Danzo explained that <a href=\"/the-first-hokage/4005-49812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49812\">Hashirama</a> united the clans to form the villages to stabilize the lands, and now he's trying to bring together the villages to stabilize the world, a world that Akatsuki threatens to destroy and he has to stop. Ōnoki told him that ideals take time to flourish and that he should had been more patient because in his haste, despite his good intentions, had only succeeded in created mistrust and hate. Danzo replied that he doesn't care what anyone thinks of him as long as something gets done. Ōnoki himself however was put in his place by Gaara.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1095692-14_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1095692\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.68339768339768\" data-width=\"518\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 518px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1095692-14_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1095692\"><img alt=\"Versus Sasuke\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1095692-14_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1095692-14_2.jpg 518w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/378/1095692-14_2.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1095692-14_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Versus Sasuke</figcaption></figure><p>While Raikage and his body guards were off fighting <a href=\"/sasuke/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\">Sasuke</a>, Kurotsuchi wanted to go watch since Sasuke was the one that killed <a href=\"/deidara/4005-44957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44957\">Deidara</a>, but Akatsuchi opted to stay behind and tend to Ōnoki. Sasuke eventually found himself in the Kage's room and <a href=\"/fifth-mizukage/4005-67912/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67912\">Mizukage</a> said she'd handle him, Ōnoki decided to not interfere. <a href=\"/zetsu/4005-45020/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45020\">Zetsu</a> however had secretly infected all of them with one of his jutsu, saving Sasuke from Mizukage. They all freed themselves of Zetsu's trap and Ōnoki proceeded to try to kill Sasuke, <a href=\"/tobi/4005-45000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45000\">Madara</a> however teleported in and saved the unconscious Sasuke. Madara revealed his plans to unite the world, which confused Ōnoki; he once fought Madara and knew first hand of what he was capable of, saying that Madara should have the power to do anything he wants and wondered why Madara was being so sneaky, to which Madara revealed that his fight with Hashirama left him weakened.</p><p>After Madara left, Ōnoki decided to join the alliance with the other Kages. He wanted to put <a href=\"/killer-bee/4005-56686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56686\">Killer Bee</a> and <a href=\"/naruto/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\">Naruto</a> on the front-lines in order to combat against Madara's collection of <a href=\"/legendary-bijus/4060-54828/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54828\">Bijū</a>, however the others disagreed, saying that's what Madara probably wants so he can capture them and that they have to keep the <a href=\"/jinchuuriki/4015-55835/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55835\">Jinchūriki</a> safe. After leaving the summit, Kurotsuchi advised to kill the Jinchūriki so that Madara couldn't get the last two Bijū, but Onoki remembered what Gaara said to him and decided not to.</p><p>At the meeting Ōnoki agreed that the best place to hide Naruto and Killer Bee would be in the Cloud village on their hidden island. But later when the whereabouts of the jinchūriki are compromised, it's discussed what should be done. It's decided that only a small elite team should go as not to openly reveal their location and Ōnoki volunteers himself to go. Gaara tries to go himself, but Ōnoki insists and sets out with Kurotsuchi and Akatsuchi after giving them his ability to fly.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470192\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66924564796905\" data-width=\"517\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 517px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470192\"><img alt=\"In Wait\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg 517w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"In Wait\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg 517w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/378/1470192-3145277.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>In Wait</figcaption></figure><p>As Kabuto and Deidara closed in on the island turtle that Naruto and Killer Bee are on, they are intercepted by Ōnoki whom ambushed Kabuto and punches a hole in Kabuto's chest, but it's Deidara's clay clone which explodes. However it wasn't the real Ōnoki either, it was an Earth Clone made by Akatsuchi. While they're engaged, Kabuto reveals that he has made a bigger, more powerful clone of Manda which finds and attacks the island turtle. Deidara detonated some of his clay bombs beneath the island turtle trying to make it topple over, but it didn't. Kabuto went off to find Naruto and Killer Bee while Deidara kept the others busy, but Kurotsuchi chased after Kabuto. Ōnoki prepared to use an immensely powerful Dust release jutsu against Deidara, but is stopped by Akatsuchi whom reminds Ōnoki that he'd kill the island turtle. Deidara takes the opportunity to attack with a clay bomb, but Akatsuchi blocks it with one of his stone golems.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470194-3148517.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470194\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1690544412607\" data-width=\"349\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 349px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470194-3148517.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470194\"><img alt=\"The Terrifying Tsuchikage\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px\" data-width=\"547\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470194-3148517.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470194-3148517.jpg 349w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Terrifying Tsuchikage\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470194-3148517.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1470194-3148517.jpg 349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px\" data-width=\"547\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Terrifying Tsuchikage</figcaption></figure><p>Ōnoki and Deidara then engage in an aerial battle, one which Akatsuchi cannot keep up with, and Ōnoki comments on how he always hated how Deidara would sneak off and attack. Once they're far enough away, Ōnoki attempts to use his jutsu again, but Deidara is unsummoned after Kabuto escapes. Ōnoki returns to talk to the others and they reveal that Kabuto captured Yamato. This makes Ōnoki unsettled but they ensure him that Yamato won't reveal any information, Ōnoki however replies that Yamato won't be able to resist Madara's power.</p><p>As the war progressed, news came to light that Kabuto had resurrected <a href=\"/muu/4005-75680/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75680\">Mū</a>, the Second Tsuchikage and the one who taught Ōnoki Dust jutsus. BothŌnoki and Tsunade agreed that he was the only one who could stop Mū. During the course of the battle, Ōnoki strained his back too much and needed assistance from Gaara. Despite this, Mū was gaining the upper hand until one of Naruto's Shadow Clones arrived to help and they momentarily defeated Mū. Ōnoki and Gaara moved onto confront the <a href=\"/second-mizukage/4005-76567/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76567\">2nd Mizukage</a> whom proved to be even more challenging, especially since Ōnoki didn't have enough chakra to use his Dust techniques anymore. Thanks to Gaara's cleverness, they were able to finally defeat the 2nd Mizukage. To their surprise, Mū was not yet defeat... but more shocking than that was the sudden arrival of <a href=\"/madara-uchiha/4005-80827/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80827\">Madara Uchiha</a>, leaving the alliance to wonder who the masked man really is. During a short confrontation, Madara resorted to trying to wipe out all of his opponents with an asteroid. Ōnoki succeeded in stopping it, but was unable to stop the second one which wiped out most of the division and left him greatly injured. The arrival of Tsunade, Ay, and Mei however tipped the odds into the alliance's favor against Madara...</p><p>The Five Kage then told Naruto to go after the other Madara while they stayed behind to take care of the reanimated Madara.</p><h2>Powers/Abilities</h2><p>Ōnoki has shown the ability to use Earth jutsu, using a jutsu called \"Rising Earth Core\" to move a section of the ground up or down, \"Rock Fist\" where he covers his hand and arm in rocks for improved striking power, \"Rock Clone\" where he creates duplicates of himself using stones as a medium, \"Stone Golem\" in which he creates a giant humanoid statue to attack or defend. He also has \"Added Weight Rock\" and the more powerful \"Super Added Weight Rock\" which increases the weight of whatever he touches. He has shown the ability to fly by currently unknown means, and can make others fly by touching them; this could be related to his jutsu \"Light Weight Rock\" and the more powerful \"Ultra Light Weight Rock\" where he can make things lighter by touching them. He can also combine Earth, Wind, and Fire to use a bloodline limit called Dust release (Jinton). He has used one Dust jutsu so far: \"Detachment from the Primitive World\", which destroys the molecules of whatever it hits.</p>",

In order to do so, she killed Lobo's then current girlfriend and became his lover before feeding his beloved Space Dolphin's to the unwitting Lobo. The realization of what had transpired, left Lobo broken and seemingly ended his career.</p><p>Bling Bling then had Lobo hired to assassinate Nabob Abui, the ruler of Y'Abbah Dhabba Dhu. After killing the Nabob, Lobo became the new Nabob and was forced to stay on Y'Abbah Dhabba Dhu. Bling Bling then tried to kill Lobo, in order to get control over the planet and its Coproma 37 deposits which are needed to build intergalactic power chips. However, in direct combat she was no match for Lobo who refused to kill Bling Bling and instead just ripped half of her face off, believing that killing Bling Bling would be more merciful than forcing her to live with a disfigured face.</p>",

He was also one of the Reich's top assassins.He lived in the United States for some time already when he received a mission that would change history forever.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Heinz Kruger was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america-comics-1-meet-captain-america/4000-107870/\">Captain America Comics issue 1 </a>(1941). He was one of the first villains form Marvel Comics, and also one to have perished as one of the first. Although he is not often seen in comics, his actions have caused Captain America to be the only true Super Soldier to date.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Mission</h3><figure style=\"width: 281px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2590318\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2590318-kruger.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.7935943060498\" data-width=\"281\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:179.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2590318-kruger.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2590318\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2590318-kruger.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2590318-kruger.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One day, his sources told him he was to kill<a href=\"/abraham-erskine/4005-43681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43681\"> Professor Erskine</a> if the rumors where true that the scientist had created the<a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\"> Super-Soldier Serum</a>. He was told that this would blow his cover and almost certainly mean he would not escape alive. The days before the assasination, Kruger was in a conflict with himself. He wanted to serve his country and make his wife and children proud of him, but he did not know if he could do it. Living in America for so long, he found out that Americans where not that different from his people. They all wanted to be loved and live a good and honrable life. Eventually, Kruger refused to follow his newfound feelings and accepted the assignement. It was then that Kruger, as his American alter ego Fredrick Clemson, joined a few high-ranking American army officers to the Super-Soldier Project. There he was one of the few witnesses to see the birth of Captain America. As Kruger found out the Serum worked, he shot at Captain America and professor Erskine with a gun he had concealed, killing the professor. In his attempted escape, Kruger fell on one of Professor Erskine`s machines where he was electrocuted and died. His actions had made it so that the Super-Soldier Serum died with it's creator, Professor Erskine.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Captain America: The first Avenger</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1651100-thbrthrth.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1651100-thbrthrth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"Kruger versus Captain America\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1651100-thbrthrth.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Kruger versus Captain America</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the movie, <i>\"</i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>\" (2011),<b> </b>Kruger is one of<a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\"> Red Skull'</a>s top assassins and is played by <b>Richard Armitage</b>.</p>",

While the rest of Exiles use exotic weaponry, Ching trusts in his regular handguns in combat. He was the only Exile to question <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a>'s de facto leadership, finding the Skull's ambitions in conflict with his own. Finding no support from the rest of the Exiles however, Ching had no choice but to accept Red Skull's rule. He later attempted to shoot <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America </a>in the back but was prevented from doing so by the Red Skull.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>General Ching was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1968 and first appeared in <em><a href=\"/captain-america/4050-2400/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2400\">Captain America </a></em>#103. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Anita is an otherwise normal girl dragged into <a data-ref-id=\"4015-52203\" href=\"/demons/4015-52203/\" slug=\"demons\">demonic</a> behaviour after a teenage prank goes wrong and kills her best friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-63356\" href=\"/jennifer-check/4005-63356/\" slug=\"jennifer-check\">Jennifer Check</a>. She had been friends with Jennifer since a young age.</p><p>She is based off the character from the movie <a data-ref-id=\"4025-668\" href=\"/jennifers-body/4025-668/\" slug=\"jennifers-body\">Jennifer’s Body</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The movie character was written by Diablo Cody and her likeness in comic is therefore based off of Amanda Seyfried. Her only appearance was in the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-27556\" href=\"/jennifers-body/4050-27556/\" slug=\"jennifers-body\">graphic novel version of the movie</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Although she plays the usual character type which is personified in many high school stories (the nerd that doesn't understand her own beauty), she does show some more depth through the story as more than a pretty face.</p><p>She shows some curiosity into her own sexuality by <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55788\" href=\"/homosexuality/4015-55788/\" slug=\"homosexuality\">passionately kissing</a> Jennifer at one point.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Her sole appearance was in the novelization of the move Jennifer’s Body and thus her story there is almost identical to the of the movie. her best friend is Jennifer Check who is described as a sweet girl that likes to party hard. Despite her prudish nature she is talked into going to a bar with Jennifer. Once there they meet a band named Low Shoulder. A fire breaks out seemingly by accident and Jennifer is abducted by the band leaving Needy wondering where she has gone. They subsequently sacrifice her to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21893\" href=\"/satan/4005-21893/\" slug=\"satan\">the devil</a> as they needed a virgin for the rite. Due to the fact that she is not a virgin (in any sense) she becomes possessed by a demon. She goes to Needy’s house to kill her but then finds that she cannot go through with it. She starts to kill people in rapid succession including Needy’s boyfriend, Chip Daniels. After figuring out what is happening Needy kills Jennifer but is bitten by her in the process and has the demonic powers transferred to her. She goes back to seek vengeance against the band members and kills them all.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Anita is an otherwise normal person until possessed by the demon when she gains typical supernatural powers – heightened strength, durability and enhanced speed.</p>",

It is said that she was the the sentient being that created the <a href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\">Infinity Gems</a>, it is also said that she might be older than the current universe. At a moment in her history she committed a form of suicide and transformed herself into six very powerful gems, the <a href=\"/infinity-gems/4055-41041/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\">Infinity Gems</a>. Each of the gems possessed an incredible and different power, which the wielder of that gem would acquire.</p><p>The vampire known as <a href=\"/rune/4005-14977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14977\">Rune</a> tried to reunite the Infinity Gems into the entity known as Nemesis. He traveled to the Marvel Universe to take possession of the Infinity Gems that were in the custody pf the <a href=\"/infinity-watch/4060-25623/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25623\">Infinity Watch</a>. The <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> was sent to battle Rune and prevent Nemesis's resurrection by the <a href=\"/living-tribunal/4005-6811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6811\">Living Tribunal</a>. The Silver Surfer managed to blast one of Rune's hands in which he held five of the six Infinity Gems. The last Infinity Gem was the <a href=\"/soul-gem/4055-55645/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55645\">Soul Gem</a> and was on Rune's forehead. The five Infinity Gems were scattered throughout the Ultraverse.</p><p>Soon after <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> traveled to the Ultraverse and gained possession of the six Infinity Gems. Then the <a href=\"/elders-of-the-universe/4060-41142/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41142\">Elder of the Universe</a> <a href=\"/grandmaster/4005-32735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32735\">Grandmaster</a> came and challenged Loki to a bet, where they would have to wager their Infinity Gems. Loki with his six Infinity Gems and the Grandmaster who wagered his seventh known as the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ego-gem/4055-57718/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57718\">Ego Gem</a> (which was possessing the <a href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\">Eternal</a> Sersi). Both selected teams from both the Marvel Universe and Ultraverse. The Grandmaster picked the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> from the Marvel Universe, while Loki picked the <a href=\"/ultraforce/4060-41810/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41810\">Ultraforce</a> from the Ultraverse. Eventually Loki won this interdimensional wager by using his Reality Gem.</p><p>When Loki and Sersi came into contact, the seventh gem fused with the other Infinity Gems, recreating the original form of the Infinity Gems, Nemesis. As the living embodiment of the Infinity Gems, Nemesis could achieve virtually anything just by simply willing it.</p><p>She was weakened by the sentience the gems had achieved during their time as individual entities and Nemesis was defeated by the combined efforts of the Avengers and Ultraforce. </p>",

    "deck": "Lady Gaga is a famous pop music star who appears in Blue Waters Comics Fame. She is a international success and currently has four albums out, also a collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett.",
    "description": "<p>Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta who's known by the media and fans as her stage name Lady Gaga.Stefani was born in Yonkers, New York with her Italian parents Cynthia whose maiden name was Bissett and her father Joe Germanotta. Whenever Gaga was bad when she was a young child her mother use to sit her near the piano as a punishment hoping Gaga would eventually play. Back then Gaga was a very spiteful little girl so it took her awhile to finally decide to learn the piano but once she finally decided to play it at the young age of 4 years old. When Stefani was 14 years old her mother would take her to clubs so Gaga could play songs with her high school band which was a Led Zepplin cover band. At the age of 17 she was accepted a place in the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. During her second year of Tisch Gaga dropped out as she felt as she could teach herself about art. She started to perform in the Lower East Side of New York club scene. This is where everything changed for Stefani as she met her mentor Lady Starlight who helped Stefani transform to Lady Gaga.</p><p>Lady Gaga is now known as a controversial figure in the music industry due to her outstanding unusual outfits and her songs that touch many subjects the audience are sensitive about such as sex, media, and fame. How did Lady Gaga become a professional singer? You can thank Akon due to him signing her up to a record company. Shortly after this her debut album The Fame was released in October 2008. The album broke dozens of records including for being the number one album for 12 consecutive weeks. Her crazy, electro/retro alternative pop fashion sense was drawn from inspirations like Grace Jones, David Bowie and Elton John. Her fashion sense has attracted more attention than her music, and Ms Gaga now even has her own Fashion house: The Haus Of Gaga.</p><p>Her second album: The Fame Monster, is a deluxe edition of The Fame that includes eight new songs such as the hits \"Bad Romance, Telephone, and Alejandro\". This era deals with the dark side of the fame and where fans called her 'Mama Monster'. 'Dance In The Dark' talks about the fear of a girl having sex with the lights on as she's embarrassed of her body. 'Speechless' was written to convince Stefani's dad to get open heart surgery so it was dedicated to him and her grandfather. 'Teeth' talks about the fear of sex and 'So Happy I Could Die' talks about a fear of alcohol. The whole concept of this album is fear and men.</p><p>Then, her third and current album that's out \"Born This Way\" is an inspirational album that talks about politics, spirituality, and religion. This is her first album that has different music elements besides pop such as heavy metal, rock, disco, and opera. Gaga got more musical control on this album than her previous ones and RedOne is one of the producers again of this album just as he was for The Fame and Fame Monster. At the 2011 Grammy's Lady Gaga thanked Whitney Houston for inspiring her for Born This Way as Gaga would picture her sing it. Madonna and Bruce Springsteen also have inspired her album majorly with the beats and lyrics. On June 1st Born This Way became the fastest selling album of 2011 so far proving that Lady Gaga will stick around a lot longer than what people expected. The album has sold over 5 million worldwide and still counting so far.</p><p>Lady Gaga is also an actress with appearances in <em>Machete Kills </em>and in the 2015 season of <em>American Horror Story</em>.</p><h3>Albums</h3><p>Red and Blue (2006)</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1936835\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99265/1936835-lady_gaga_red_and_blue_something_crazy_lyrics.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.95\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99265/1936835-lady_gaga_red_and_blue_something_crazy_lyrics.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1936835\"><img alt=\"Only about 1,000 of these copies got out.\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/99265/1936835-lady_gaga_red_and_blue_something_crazy_lyrics.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99265/1936835-lady_gaga_red_and_blue_something_crazy_lyrics.jpg 640w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/99265/1936835-lady_gaga_red_and_blue_something_crazy_lyrics.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Only about 1,000 of these copies got out.</figcaption></figure><p>The Fame (2008)</p><p>The Fame Monster (2009)</p><p>Born This Way (2011)</p><p>ARTPOP (2013)</p><p>Cheek to Cheek (2014)</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Singles (including promotionals)</h3><p>Just Dance</p><p>Poker Face</p><p>Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)</p><p>Beautiful, Dirty, Rich</p><p>Christmas Tree</p><p>LoveGame</p><p>Paparazzi</p><p>Dance In The Dark</p><p>Speechless</p><p>Your Song (featuring Elton John)</p><p>Bad Romance</p><p>Telephone</p><p>Alejandro</p><p>Born This Way</p><p>Judas</p><p>The Edge Of Glory</p><p>Hair</p><p>3-Way (featuring The Golden Rule)</p><p>You And I</p><p>Marry The Night</p><p>Applause</p><p>Do What U Want</p><p>G.U.Y.</p><h3>Fun Facts</h3><p>Her nickname 'Gaga' came from Queen's song 'Radio Gaga'</p><p>Lady Gaga was a brunette until she was mistaken for Amy Winehouse then she dyed her hair blonde</p><p>In 2005 she appeared on MTV's reality show 'Boiling Points'</p><p>Gaga studied with Christina Aguilera's vocal coach</p><p>Lady Gaga's sister Natali appears in the music video 'Telephone' as the brunette in the cell with Gaga</p><p>Gaga writes songs every day and usually has hundreds of songs left over from albums that she decides to keep out</p><p>She's been in an on and off relationship with Luc Carl for many years in fact You and I was written about him</p><p>She was suppose to be the opening for Michael Jackson's tour 'This Is It' as he was a big fan of her</p><p>Diagnosed with borderline positive Lupus wears wigs due to possibility of losing hair due to it (?)</p><p>She's making her own foundation that her mother is helping her with called \"Born This Way Foundation\"</p>",

He therefore created The Second and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-68722\" href=\"/third-of-the-fallen/4005-68722/\">Third of the Fallen</a>; demons of equal power to The First who would form a three-way standoff for eternity, with none of them daring to seize full control of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\" href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\">Hell</a> lest it be destroyed in civil war. While other triumvirates also reined during this time, including one featuring <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24232\" href=\"/lucifer-morningstar/4005-24232/\">Lucifer</a>, the First, Second and Third of the Fallen held the true balance of power.</p><p>After discovering that he was dying of lung cancer, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3329\" href=\"/john-constantine/4005-3329/\">Constantine</a> sold his soul to The Second of the Fallen. However, he also sold it to the First and Third as well. Knowing that they wouldn't risk war in Hell, he then slashed his wrists, forcing them to heal him completely.</p><p>The stalemate remained until The First (whose existence predated Hell) found out that the Second and Third were not his equals, but merely extremely powerful demons with major weaknesses. He then killed them both, breaking the stalemate and allowing him to go after Constantine. The remains of the Second and Third were then transformed by a mysterious third party into the Twin Blade.</p>",

    "description": "<p>After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27431\" href=\"/first-of-the-fallen/4005-27431/\">The First of the Fallen</a> was created, God realized that he needed to make something to keep The First in check. He therefore created <a data-ref-id=\"4005-68721\" href=\"/second-of-the-fallen/4005-68721/\">The Second</a> and Third of the Fallen; demons of equal power to The First who would form a three-way standoff for eternity, with none of them daring to seize full control of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\" href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\">Hell</a> lest it be destroyed in civil war. While other triumvirates also reined during this time, including one featuring <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24232\" href=\"/lucifer-morningstar/4005-24232/\">Lucifer</a>, the First, Second and Third of the Fallen held the true balance of power.</p><p>In the 1980s the Third of the Fallen was summoned by Anette, a friend of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3329\" href=\"/john-constantine/4005-3329/\">John Constantine's</a> who wanted her boyfriend, Seth, to be punished for abusing her. The Third then took on Annette's form and castrated Seth. When she realized what damage she had caused, Anette killed herself.</p><p>After discovering that he was dying of lung cancer, Constantine sold his soul to The Second of the Fallen. However, he also sold it to the First and Third as well. Knowing that they wouldn't risk war in Hell, he then slashed his wrists, forcing them to heal him completely.</p><p>The stalemate remained until The First found out that the Second and Third were not his equals, but merely extremely powerful demons with major weaknesses. He then killed them both, breaking the stalemate and allowing him to go after Constantine. The remains of the Second and Third were then transformed by a mysterious third party into the Twin Blade.</p>",
