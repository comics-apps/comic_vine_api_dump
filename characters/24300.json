Young Frankenstein was finally able to pull himself back together in Albania, and is now walking on the bottom of the Ionian Sea with a need for revenge.<br/><br/>He is one of the imprisoned heroes forced to fight in the Darkseid Tournament. He manages to make it to Round Two of the tournament where he is eventually beaten by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12694\" href=\"/hardrock/4005-12694/\" slug=\"hardrock\">Hardrock</a>, who rips his limbs off.

In this timeline, the villain known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9945\" href=\"/lord-chaos/4005-9945/\" slug=\"lord-chaos\">Lord Chaos</a> rules the world with tyranny. Battalion is the second in command of a team named the \"Team Titans\". This team was created to defeat Lord Chaos and restore the peace and freedom of the world. However, this timeline was overridden by later actions, so it no longer exists in this form. </p><p>Battalion's real last name was Lyons, but his first name is unknown. He was a concert pianist, living a happy life with his wife Essie and their two children, until Lord Chaos outlawed all music. When Lyons refused to comply, Lord Chaos decided all of Lyon's genetic line were clearly contaminated, and had his wife and children slaughtered in front of his eyes</p>Lyons vowed revenge against Lord Chaos and everything he represented, and soon joined the rebellion as Battalion, where he earned a reputation as the \"drill sergeant from hell\". Soon after that, he joined the Team Titans, a resistance force against Lord Chaos's reign. Battalion worked closely with the Nightwing of the future (later revealed not to be a future version of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\" href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" slug=\"dick-grayson\">Dick Grayson</a>) to train the brave young warriors to achieve their true potential.<br/><br/><h2>Back to the past</h2><p>One day, the leader of the Team Titans sent the team on a risky and dangerous mission to travel 10 years into the past and kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4913\" href=\"/donna-troy/4005-4913/\" slug=\"donna-troy\">Donna Troy</a> before she could give birth to Robert Long, the future Lord Chaos.</p><p>Their time travel was successful, but Donna's own teammates the New <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\" href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" slug=\"teen-titans\">Teen Titans</a> prevented her from being killed. However, even though she gave birth to Robert Long, the two Titans teams were able to work together to change the future and prevent Lord Chaos' reign. </p><h2>We did it...now what?</h2><p>After the mission was acomplished, the Team Titans were trapped into the past, with no way to return to a future no longer existed. Despite their attempt to murder her, Donna Troy let them stay in her New Jersey farmhouse while they tried to figure out how to fit into this timeline. </p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Erased from history</h2><p>Battalion started to develop feelings for Donna Troy, but before their relationship had a chance to develop,Â  the time crisis of <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40782\" href=\"/zero-hour/4045-40782/\" slug=\"zero-hour\">Zero Hour</a> revealed that their future had never truly existed.</p><p>It turns out that the being known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12940\" href=\"/monarch/4005-12940/\" slug=\"monarch\">Monarch</a> (previously called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3574\" href=\"/hawk/4005-3574/\" slug=\"hawk\">Hawk</a>) had created a false future and set himself up as the real leader of the Team Titans so that he could train young metahumans as an army of sleeper agents in order to help him rule the entire timeline. </p><p>In Zero Hour, Monarch (now called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2030\" href=\"/extant/4005-2030/\" slug=\"extant\">Extant</a>) absorbed the power of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10029\" href=\"/waverider/4005-10029/\" slug=\"waverider\">Waverider</a> and used it to take advantage of the incoming time crisis, using the Team Titans and the rest of his army to try to keep the world's heroes from preventing the time crisis. However, his plan failed; the heroes won, and all the parallel and false timelines were erased from existence.</p><p>The only three Team Titans to survive were<a data-ref-id=\"4005-5307\" href=\"/terra/4005-5307/\" slug=\"terra\"> Terra</a> II, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3587\" href=\"/mirage/4005-3587/\" slug=\"mirage\">Mirage</a>, and <span>Deathwing</span>, who turned out to be from the present timeline. Extant had erased their memories to make them part of his army. </p><p>Battalion, however, was erased from history; not only does he no longer exist, but he never truly did. </p><p>It is unknown whether the current DCU timeline will produce a Battalion of its own.</p>",

    "deck": "A hero that was raised as a normal human in Metropolis. Former teammate of Superboy in the Ravers, this young hero has the item known as H-Dial which grants him the powers of several heroes.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Hero Cruz was born and raised in the city of <a href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis</a>. Almost all of his life was ordinary, and it continued that way until the day that he was caught in trouble.</p><p>That day would be a turning point since he found a complete arsenal of weapons from the villain known as the <a href=\"/scavenger/4005-69998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69998\">Scavenger</a>. Between those weapons was the Achilles Vest, Hero Cruz decided to take it and left the rest of the weapons there.</p><p>It appears that the Achilles Vest was a <a href=\"/magic/4015-55759/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55759\">magical</a> item that granted it's wearer a great amount of invulnerability. Using that power he became the newest and possibly the most powerful member of the \"Event Horizon\". The Even Horizon was known to be one of the most important and powerful intergalactic raves in the universe.</p><p>The rave was very similar to one from earth, however it also had their differences and rules. In that rave were people from different places around the world, the galaxy and even different dimensions.</p><p>The only request that the intergalactic rave had for new members was that they must had at least one power. After Hero Cruz joined the rave he quickly made new friends with the other members.</p><p>Hero Cruz was part of a team with members of the Event Horizon, his teammates were <a href=\"/sparx/4005-12666/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12666\">Sparx</a>, <a href=\"/half-life/4005-12664/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12664\">Half-Life</a>, <a href=\"/kaliber/4005-12667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12667\">Kaliber</a>, <a href=\"/aura/4005-12668/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12668\">Aura</a> and <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a> (Kon-El). Along with Superboy and the rest of the team they traveled to various planets and had dozens of adventures.</p><h2>H-Dial</h2><p>It was <a href=\"/christmas/4015-55951/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55951\">Christmas</a> season, and Hero Cruz decided to invite all his teammates (The Ravers) to his home so that they could all spend Christmas together.</p><p>It was at this time that Scavenger discovered that someone has taken the Achilles Vest. Trying to find it he used his powers to teleport to where the Achilles Vest was, he appeared inside of Hero Cruz's house and thought that it had been Sparx who had taken the Achilles Vest. He decided to kidnap her and also took the Achilles Vest. After this the rest of the ravers went to save her.</p><p>Hero Cruz (Depowered), Superboy and Aura decided to go and free Sparx. It was during this attempt that Scavenger captured <a href=\"/superboy/4005-1686/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1686\">Superboy</a> and Aura. When it looked like nothing would save them, Hero Cruz took a dial with his name written on it. He put it and he immediately was transformed into different heroes one after the other.</p><p>One of them was the hero known as Human Justice, he outsmarted Scavenger making him to free both Superboy and Aura. After that Scavenger decided to escape, this let Hero Cruz to keep the dial for himself, he later named the dial as the \"<a href=\"/h-dial/4055-31963/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-31963\">H-dial</a>\"</p><p>Soon after that, Hero Cruz would leave the vest, he started to use his new powers granted by the H-dial to fight crime. The H-dial's ability was to make Hero Cruz become one of several heroes. Every hero was totally different to the other ones with also different powers.</p><h2>Hidden secrets</h2><p>Some time later, Hero Cruz's partner in the ravers Sparx would start to fall in love with Hero Cruz. Hero started a relationship with her using one of his hero transformations. However every time that Hero changed back to his real form he wouldn't feel any attraction to Sparx, in fact he would start to feel uncomfortable to be around her.</p><p>Hero Cruz decided to break his relationship with Sparx and reveal to her the reason of that. He revealed to Sparx that the reason he didn't feel attracted to her was because he was \"<a href=\"/homosexuality/4015-55788/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55788\">gay</a>\". This took Sparx by surprise and she needed a long time to accept it.</p><p>It was also discovered that the reason that one of his transformation was in love with Sparx was because the transformations are apparently manifestation of what he desired. Having a close friendship with Sparx was what made one of his transformations fell in love with Sparx.</p><p>While this was happening the predecessor of Hero Cruz as the owner of the H-dial, <a href=\"/vicki-grant/4005-55335/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55335\">Vicki Grant</a> had just moved to <a href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\">San Francisco</a> when she joined a band known as \"The evil children of the sun\". That band were able to make Vicki Grant become evil. That was what lead to her rush and salvage attack against Hero Cruz when they first met, however thanks to the H-Dial who remembered it's last master, she was purified and was freed from any bad influence she had thanks to the H-Dial. She decided to stay with Sparx's family until she was fully recovered.</p><h2>No more a Raver</h2><p>Some time after this the leader of the Event Horizon (Kindred Marx) would decide to disband the rave. Soon After that Hero Cruz left the team and went back to earth.</p><h2>Teen Titans</h2><p>After that the five founding titans (<a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Nightwing</a>, <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a>, <a href=\"/donna-troy/4005-4913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4913\">Donna Troy</a>, <a href=\"/roy-harper/4005-3404/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3404\">Arsenal</a> and <a href=\"/tempest/4005-2382/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2382\">Tempes</a>t) decided to form a new titans group. Each one of them nominated another candidate for membership, Hero Cruz wasn't offered membership tough.</p><p>Some time later, Beast Boy decided to revive Teen Titans West under the new name of Titans L.A., along with Bushido, Matt Logan, Bumblebee, <a href=\"/flamebird/4005-3577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3577\">Flamebird</a>, <a href=\"/beast-boy/4005-3586/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3586\">Beast Boy</a>, Captain Marvel Jr., Terra and <a href=\"/vox/4005-35124/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35124\">Herald</a>, Hero Cruz was a member, however the team didn't last.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>By dialing H-E-R-O on the mythical H-dial, Hero Cruz can transform into a different super-powered hero. Hero Cruz has learned to concentrate on a specific power when dialing, and manifesting that power in his new superhuman guise.</p><p>Hero has also surmised that the transformations are something of a psychological manifestation of the dialer. Thus, his friendly platonic affection for Sparx manifested as romantic feelings in one of his guises. Likewise, Vicki Grant's horrific transformations were linked to her poor self image at the time.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Origin</h2><p>Jason Hart (The Protector) was a student that went to a normal high school, he was a good student and also was good in sports, that without talking about his great sense of what was right and wrong. Everything was ok until the day that he discovered that his little cousin named Ted had tried drugs and apparently he was quickly becoming an addict.</p><p>Jason Hart would tell his family about this in an attempt to save his little cousin of drugs, he thought that talking with his parents the young Ted would be able to understand that drugs are bad and that they would ruin their life. Altough the family did talk to Ted he did not care about what they said; how it was illegal, how it ruined his health or how could it even kill him. The reason behind Ted's lack of trust in his family was because he thought that they did want to harm him so he decided to stay in drugs, making his cousin look for a desperate way to stop him.</p><p>Jason Hart would then remember that his little cousin was obsessed with comic books, so he decided to take a hero costume and the codename of the \"Protector\". This was an attempt of him to make Ted listen to him so he would leave the drugs, because altough he wouldn't listen to his cousin Jason Hart's advice maybe he would hear the advice of a superhero like the protector.</p><p>However something unexpected happened and Jason Hart (The Protector) would be forced to battle drug dealers to save his cousin Ted as the superhero he pretended to be. Soon after that Dick Grayson (Nightwing) would learn about this accident and decided to make Jason Hart an honorary member of the Teen Titans thanks to his great sense of right and wrong and how he defended the inocents from the criminals. Nightwing didn't stop there tough, he also decided to train Jason in terms of hand to hand combat that made him able to become a real superhero if he wanted.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Betty Barstow, the secretary to private detective Dan Hurley, is on her way to a costume ball when she decides to investigate a crime her boss didn't want to look into. She's wearing a superhero-style costume and when she encounters crooks and uses her jiu-jitsu skills to beat them, she comes off as a superheroine, and so she decides to make a practice of fighting crime. In the modern era she was brought back. In Invaders she was shown using recently-acquired armor to help <a data-ref-id=\"4060-25865\" href=\"/invaders/4060-25865/\">The Invaders</a> against the Battle-Axis during World War II, for which she was made an honorary member of the Invaders before becoming a founding member of the current V-battalion. She is still active with V-Battalion today but is suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Her creation isn't totally clear. She was created in part by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-43671\" href=\"/harry-sahle/4040-43671/\">Harry Sahle</a>, but others may have had their hand in, as well.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br /></h2><p>Bombu is an alien from an immortal (or unimaginably long lived) race. He made earthfall long ages ago in the Amazon jungle. His mission was to gather intelligence for a future invasion of the Earth. To disguise himself, Bombu took over a native village and became its \"witch doctor\". When a plane crash deposited two outsiders into his village Bombu demonstrated his magical powers, and later \"conjured\" a storm. Ironically, Bombu died by being struck dead with a lightning bolt from his own storm. The two men then discovered that the âtribal maskâ Bombu wore was actually... HIS REAL FACE!</p><h2>Powers<br /></h2><p>Bombu's magic was undoubtedly the result of technology so advanced as to be indistinguishable from \"magic\".</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br/></h2><p>After the Spanish Conquest of the New World, a lone tribe of Aztecs fled and hid themselves away successfully. They developed a set of magical paints that when used, it made whatever was painted real.</p><p>Frank Johnson, a comic artist was gifted the paints by the lost tribe. In return he travelled to Mexico and, on the wall of an ancient temple, painted the being that would be known as Zzutak. It was to be used by the tribe to conquer the world, now that a talented artist had imagined such a beast, the tribe would be armed with an army of such creatures to be manufactured by their paints! Realizing that this was their evil scheme all along, Johnson painted another monster and the two battled, destroying both.</p>",

Diablo came to Earth to the Sierra Madre mountains to conquer the world. Diablo is very similar to Kraggoom, and the two may be of the same species, or from the same basic type of species in the same way that in the Marvel Universe there are different offshoots of genus Homo or at the very least hominids.</p><p>One key difference between Kraggoom and Diablo is that Diablo is a cretinous moron; fooled by a simple cigarette lighter being blown out into believing that all Earth people had the power to snuff out beings like him. Hm. Perhaps he is not a moron but had some other urgent reason to flee back to the fifth dimension. Both Kraggoom and Diablo first appear on Earth at roughly the same time- \"centuries\" ago according to Diablo, the sixteenth century AD for Kraggoom.Â  <br/></p><h2>Creation<br/></h2><p>Diablo was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\" href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" slug=\"jack-kirby\">             Jack Kirby</a> in 1960 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2007\" href=\"/tales-of-suspense/4050-2007/\" slug=\"tales-of-suspense\">            Tales of Suspense</a> # 9.Â Â    <br/></p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs<br/></h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-22523\" href=\"/xemnu/4005-22523/\" slug=\"xemnu\"> </a></p> <h3>The Hulk<br/></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1835028-538276_d3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1835028\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1835028-538276_d3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1835028\"><img alt=\"Â Diablo smothers the Hulk with his smoky body. \" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1835028-538276_d3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1835028-538276_d3.jpg 208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px\" data-width=\"208\"></a><figcaption>Â Diablo smothers the Hulk with his smoky body. </figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-22523\" href=\"/xemnu/4005-22523/\" slug=\"xemnu\">  Xemnu</a> the Titan learned that Earth was visited by several alien beings that possessed various powers and abilities but the United States Government wanted to keep the existence of extra-terrestrial visitors top secret.

Xemnu would unleash these deadly beings on one of his oldest foes, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\" href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" slug=\"hulk\">    Hulk</a>. Diablo, the demon from the fifth dimension was the first to attack the Hulk. The gamma giant's punches would pass harmlessly through the smoky body of Diablo. The Hulk is caught in the powerful grip of Diablo and is smothered by the demon's body. Hulk gets weaker but manages to escape when he burrows underneath the ground to escape. The Hulk would disperse Diablo's body from the wind he created with several hand claps. Â  <br/></p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<br/></h2><p>Diablo is a behemoth made out of smoke and possesses superhuman strength, durability and resistance to injury. Diablo is impervious to firearms and explosives because they pass harmlessly through his body. However, Diablo can physically touch and grab solid objects where he normally suffocates his opponents with his smoke. <br/></p>",

Each drop of his blood regenerated into a new Lobo, and a wild hoard of Lobos ravaged Apokolips, fight each other until only one remained and the defacto Lobo. Unknown to him, one drop of blood formed into a smaller, weaker clone. This clone knew he was not the strongest and hid on Young Justice's space ship to keep himself from being killed.</p><p>The clone felt he was weak and did not deserve the name Lobo. He finally shook his depression when his teammate <a href=\"/secret/4005-1682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1682\">Secret</a>, telling a story said \"So Lobo here took it as a challenge.\" The clone proclaimed that he liked that and would henceforth be named Slobo. He became the team's mechanic and maintained a strong bond with <a href=\"/empress/4005-1684/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1684\">Empress</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, Slobo's genetics proved to be problematic and his body began to degrade, causing him to weaken and go blind. Knowing he would die soon, he sacrificed his life to save his teammate, Secret, from <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a>. Darkseid's omega beams transported Slobo's essence into the future, where he became trapped in his own statue in the headquarters of the 853rd century's Young Justice.</p>",

The Night Shift members agreed to give up their demon-given energies to power up the West Coast Avengers. Misfit and the rest of the Night Shift decided to help the Avengers and they attacked Satannish together.

Tick Tock was crucial in getting them past the guards seeing their next movement. He helped Captain America and the Shroud watch over the guards they captured while the rest go in the building. Tick Tock got away with the Night Shift.</p><p>Tick Tock joined the Night Shift again when they attacked the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\" href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" slug=\"avengers-west-coast\">      West Coast</a> <a href=\"../../avengers-west-coast/65-29075/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Avengers</a>. He helped predict when <a href=\"../../vision/29-1504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Vision</a> would turn solid and defeated him. By selling some of his soul to <a href=\"../../satannish/29-13799/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Satannish</a>, Tick Tock gained powers to slow down time around certain areas. Though <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Doctor Strange</a> eventually saved Tick's sole, he lost the augmented abilities. It is assumed his remaining powers eventually left him on <a href=\"../../m-day/12-41003/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      M-Day</a> when most mutants were depowered by the <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Scarlet Witch</a>. He has certainly not been seen since M-Day, and it appears he left the Night Shift.</p><p>Tick Tock would reunite with the Night Shift when they are hired by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44971\" href=\"/snapdragon/4005-44971/\" slug=\"snapdragon\">      Snapdragon</a> to eliminate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1493\" href=\"/moon-knight/4005-1493/\" slug=\"moon-knight\">      Moon Knight</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9038\" href=\"/echo/4005-9038/\" slug=\"echo\">      Echo</a> in Los Angeles. Tick Tock and the Night Shift fail to kill Moon Knight which would lead to their ultimate demise. Tick Tock and the Night Shift would be confronted by the new West Coast Kingpin, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3229\" href=\"/count-nefaria/4005-3229/\" slug=\"count-nefaria\">      Count Nefaria</a> where he incinerates them for being so incompetent and moronically stupid. <br/><br/></p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Tick Tock could see all possible futures for the upcoming minute. He could also affect the probability of which one would occur. During the time he had sold his soul, he gained the addition ability to freeze time. However he lost this ability once he regained his life. While not confirmed, it is assumed he lost his powers on <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\" href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" slug=\"m-day\">      M-Day</a>.</p>",

He captured Ant-Man and used his serum to become huge. He then launched an attack on the world, but Ant-Man defeated him and turned him back into an insect again. He has, however, returned to fight other Marvel heroes over time, including the West Coast Avengers and Iron Man. He appeared in the final issue of Sensational She-Hulk.</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 1.5', (variously 6\" and 50\")</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 0.35 oz (225 lbs at 6\", 64 tons at 50\")</li><li><b>Eye Color:</b> Black (varies)</li><li><b>Hair Color:</b> none</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Citizenship:</b> None</li><li><b>Education:</b> Self-taught</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Conqueror</li></ul><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>The Scarlet Beetle has a genius-level intellect and can command insects, arachnids, and other arthropods.

    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2>In some traditions Hebe is the third child of the King and Queen of the Olympians, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\" href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\"> Zeus </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13898\" href=\"/hera/4005-13898/\"> Hera</a>. Â In other traditions, she is just the daughter of Hera (without any father). Â In any case, Hera is Hebe's mother and they have a very close relationship. Â In ancient times, Hebe was regarded as the goddess of youth and the cup-bearer of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-44825\" href=\"/olympian-gods/4060-44825/\"> Greco-Roman Olympian gods</a>.Â Â  As theÂ cupbearer to the gods, the recipes for nectar and ambrosia are hers - the Formulae For Immortality. Â She prepares the food and drink of the gods, and disperses it at all Pantheon feasts and celebrations. Â Upon Heracles mortal death, when Zeus cast his mortal shade to the underworld and transformed his godly side into the god <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\" href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\"> Hercules</a>, Hera offered her daughter to Zeus' son as his wife as a sort of apology and expression of godly solidarity. Though Hera and Hercules' relationship would always remain strained, Hebe and Hercules for a time had a blissful marriage. They begot two sons, named Alexiares and Anicetus.<br /><h2>Mayor Story Arcs<br /></h2> <h3>Relationship With Hercules</h3>When Zeus took pity on Heracles and split the divine essence from his mortal shade and raised him up into Olympus as a god, Zeus officiated the marriage between Hebe (Hera's favorite daughter) and Hercules in order to finally make peace with Hera, whose jealous anger plagued Hercules all his life (and actually caused the deaths of Heracles' mortal family and many loved ones). Â Despite the happy beginnings to their marriage (in Olympian terms that was several centuries), the tenuous nature of the Olympian Pantheon drove a wedge into their relationship. Â This was also coupled with Hercule's lust and philandering nature. Â Following an argument between Hercules and Zeus, Hebe tried to intervene. However, Hercules told her that until he put things right with Zeus, she was not to be seen with him. She related this to Zeus, and told him that Hercules had left Olympus.Â <br /><br />For centuries Hebe and Hercules were estranged and never met physically, but Hebe kept an eye on Hercules' activities in the mortal realm. Â Hebe observed as <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55673\" href=\"/olympus/4020-55673/\"> Olympus</a> was assaulted by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\" href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\"> Hulk</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15756\" href=\"/cronus/4005-15756/\"> Cronus</a> and creatures such as the Giants. Â In one of their very few encounters, Hebe brought nectar to Hercules after he had been teleported to Olympus by Zeus to recover from injuries incurred battling the Hulk while shorn of his immortality and half of his strength.<br /><h3>Incredible Hercules</h3> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1233244-hebe_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233244\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.45238095238095\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1233244-hebe_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233244\"><img alt=\"Hebe meeting and greeting Norman Osborn\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1233244-hebe_3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1233244-hebe_3.jpg 924w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1233244-hebe_3.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Hebe meeting and greeting Norman Osborn</figcaption></figure>Â <br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1233245-hebe_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233245\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.63081695966908\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1233245-hebe_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233245\"><img alt=\"Hebe acting as \"Cup-Bearer\"\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1233245-hebe_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66472/1233245-hebe_2.jpg 967w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66472/1233245-hebe_2.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66472/1233245-hebe_2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Hebe acting as \"Cup-Bearer\"</figcaption></figure>Following the death of Zeus and the fall of Olympus at the hands of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44368\" href=\"/mikaboshi/4005-44368/\"> Mikaboshi</a>, all the Greco-Roman gods were forced to live among mortals (including Hebe).Â Â Hera inherited not only Zeus' thunderbolt, but also his shares of the Olympian Gods' corporation in the mortal world, the Olympus Group. Â Hera 'hired' Hebe to be the company's receptionist and her personal assistant. Â In her new role, Hebe still functions as cup-bearer to the gods as she serves <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13898\" href=\"/hera/4005-13898/\"> Hera</a>,Â <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2197\" href=\"/apollo/4005-2197/\"> Apollo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2359\" href=\"/artemis/4005-2359/\"> Artemis</a>,Â <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13905\" href=\"/hephaestus/4005-13905/\"> Hephaestus</a>Â and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2636\" href=\"/pluto/4005-2636/\"> Pluto</a>, their coffee during an Olympus Group meeting. Â After Hebe disseminates the business prospectus, Hera reveals her plans to them - the deaths of the half-breeds Athena and Hercules! Â While Hebe served coffee at the Olympus Group meeting, she accidentally dropped the coffee and this is the first time it is shown that Hebe is not fully adapting to her new life on Earth. Â Next, she is seen in her job as receptionist of the Olympus Group, answering phones, greeting guests, using the computer, and editing documents (all with a great deal of difficulty).Â  During her duty as receptionist, she greets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\" href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\"> Norman Osborn</a> who heavily insults her, yet she appears unfazed (most likely because she does not know who Norman is nor the colloquialisms he uses to demean her). Â <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\" href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\"> Hercules</a> reveals to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\" href=\"/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\"> Amadeus Cho</a> that Hebe collects beanie babies. Â Hebe does seem to enjoy the mortal world, but only certain aspects.<br /><br /><p>After a disappointing meeting with Osborn, Hera orders Hebe to notify the Olympian Gods that the reckoning for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13902\" href=\"/athena/4005-13902/\"> Athena</a> and her friends will be that night.Â  When Hebe asks \"Even Hercules...?\" Hera responds \"No, Daughter... Especially Hercules.\"Â  Hebe then notifies the Olympus Group in addition to Norman Osborn.Â  She lies to Norman Osborn and said that the Olympus Group was rolling out the \"Continuum\" so his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55990\" href=\"/dark-avengers/4060-55990/\"> Dark Avengers</a> would attack the Gods. When Hebe returns home she feeds a number a cats (she calls them \"Fur Babies\") and then displays a shine to her estranged husband, Hercules, stating \"One Day Husband... We Will Be Together Again.Â  You'll See...\"<br /><br />With The Olympus Group and Normanâs pet âheroesâ attacking, Athena, Hercules and Amadeus barely escape by turning the two side against one another, and Hera realizes that she has a traitor in her company (secretly Herculesâ wife Hebe,Â  who has been stalking him for some time now.)Â  Back at the Olympus Group, Hera confrontes Hebe for her treachery.Â  Hebe confessed that she was protecting Hercules as part of her first duty in life - to protect her husband.Â  Hera tells Hebe that her first and only duty is to listen to her mother! Hera then throws HER OWN DAUGHTER OUT A FIFTIETH STORY WINDOW.Â  Hera explains that unquenchable hope is Hebe's curse, as she is the goddess of youth.Â  This is why she is cupbearer to the gods, and the recipes for nectar and ambrosia are hers: For Hope Springs Eternal.Â  Hebe then abandons the Olympus Group in search of Hercules, after fulling regenerating from her relatively minor injuries.Â  Hera then disowns Hebe by saying \"Pathetic.Â  I no longer have a daughter.\" <br /><br /></p> <h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2>Hebe possesses the standard abilities of an Olympian goddess, plus unique abilities as she is the goddess of youth and cupbearer to the gods. She possesses superhuman strength (Class 25), stamina, durability, vitality, healing and functional immortality. Â Since reaching early adulthood she has not aged; she is immune to harm from conventional means of injury and cannot suffer from any terrestrial disease. Should she indeed incur a wound her godly metabolism enables her to regenerate at a superhuman rate of speed. Â She also possesses the innate ability to manipulate magic as all Olympians do, but she has yet to show an proficiency in this area. Â Prior to the destruction of Olympus,Â Â Hebe should have be able to teleport between Olympus and Earth.Â <br />Â <br />In her role as the goddess of youth, she is able to restore the youth and vitality to mortals and animals if they have reached an advanced age.Â Â She is also cupbearer to the gods, and the recipes for nectar and ambrosia are hers - the Formulae For Immortality itself.

She assisted <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a> in a few of his missions where they shared a mutual goals. Initially however she had less than friendly interactions with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" slug=\"x-men\">X-Man,</a> after she was activated from her sleeper role to hunt down and capture <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3160\" href=\"/nitro/4005-3160/\" slug=\"nitro\">Nitro</a> along with two other Atlantean sleeper agents, Paul and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-83857\" href=\"/janus/4005-83857/\" slug=\"janus\">Janus.</a> Nitro was considered an enemy of the Atlantean's after his role in killing Namor's cousin <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2113\" href=\"/namorita/4005-2113/\" slug=\"namorita\">Namorita</a>.

Assisting each other eventually Wolverine got the information he wanted from Nitro and the conflict of interest he had with Amir was resolved.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Amir was created by writer <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42339\" href=\"/marc-guggenheim/4040-42339/\" slug=\"marc-guggenheim\">Marc Guggenheim,</a> and artist <a data-ref-id=\"4040-1678\" href=\"/humberto-ramos/4040-1678/\" slug=\"humberto-ramos\">Humberto Ramos</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41780\" href=\"/carlos-cuevas/4040-41780/\" slug=\"carlos-cuevas\">Carlos Cuevas.</a> She first appears in volume 3 of Wolverine, in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-10809\" href=\"/wolverine/4050-10809/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine #43.</a></p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Some time later a bond between both characters is revealed, Wolverine appearing to confide in Amir. She aided him in a few of his missions, but was ultimately killed during one of them.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Amir has many of the standard Atlantean species traits. Body adapted to living underwater, the ability to breath and function underwater, withstand the pressures, temperatures and living conditions of the sea. Enhanced senses as well. Amir has superhuman characteristics, increased strength, speed, agility, and durability. Whilst under water, she can lift up to 75 tons, but after prolonged periods out of water, that amount is decreased. With a body adapted to withstanding deep pressure under water, Amir can withstand gunshots, and blasts, and is otherwise very durable. She also possesses a healing factor that works best in tandem with exposure to water. Amir uses Atlantean technology to breath on land. As a member of the Atlantean Royal Guard and a sleeper agent, Amir has been trained in various martial arts forms and is a formidable fighter.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Very little is known about Annie Crook, who was born sometime c. 1862. During the 1880s she supposedly worked in a shop in or around Cleveland Street. In April of 1885 she gave birth to a daughter, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62783\" href=\"/alice-margaret-crook/4005-62783/\" slug=\"alice-margaret-crook\">Alice Margaret Crook</a>, whose father was not named at the time. The two were poor and frequently lived in workhouses when they could not support themselves. Annie was eventually institutionalized for recurrent epilepsy. She died in 1920.Â Â Â <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Jack the Ripper</h3>In the early 1970s a man named Joseph Gorman came forward, calling himself Joseph Sickert and claiming to be the illegitimate son of Alice Crook and painter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46907\" href=\"/walter-sickert/4005-46907/\" slug=\"walter-sickert\">Walter Sickert</a>. He claimed that his grandmother, Annie, had secretly married <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30937\" href=\"/prince-albert-victor/4005-30937/\" slug=\"prince-albert-victor\">Prince Albert Victor</a>, then second in line to the throne, and had his mother, Alice. The two were kept in a home on Cleveland Street where the Prince would visit them often, until their affair was uncovered by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30943\" href=\"/queen-victoria/4005-30943/\" slug=\"queen-victoria\">Queen Victoria</a> and the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, who ordered the apartment raided and remanded Annie to an institution under the care of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30940\" href=\"/william-gull/4005-30940/\" slug=\"william-gull\">William Gull</a>, where she was certified insane. He claimed that his mother, Alice, later became Sickert's lover. He claimed that the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> murders were carried out, again by William Gull, to silence <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30941\" href=\"/mary-kelly/4005-30941/\" slug=\"mary-kelly\">Mary Kelly</a> and her friends who were aware of the embarrassing affair and were attempting to blackmail the government with this information.Â Â <br/>Â <br/>This theory, commonly dubbed the \"royal conspiracy\", has been widely discredited for a number of reasons. While it is true that Annie and Alice both existed, and Gorman was indeed Alice's son, he was one of five children born to her and her husband, William Gorman.Â It has been estimated that Alice herself would have been conceived sometime in the summer of 1884, when the Prince was in Germany and thus unavailable to father her. Alice herself later claimed that her father was named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62792\" href=\"/william-crook/4005-62792/\" slug=\"william-crook\">William Crook</a>, which was the name of her grandfather, and has been suggested by some to indicate that she was the product of an incestuous union between Annie and her father, though there is of course no proof of this conjecture.Â Â <br/>Â <br/>It has also been pointed out that no records exist of the marriage between the Prince and Annie, and even if they had married, their marriage would have been invalidated because he had failed to gain the approval of his grandmother, voiding it through the Royal Marriages Act of 1772. As well, the home in which Annie was alleged to have been kept along with her daughter, 6 Cleveland Street,Â had been torn down before April of 1888, and both she and Alice were paupers, with no indication they were receiving money from a wealthy patron. Gorman claimed that Annie was a Catholic, but there is no evidence to support it, and even if it were true it would have simply removed Albert Victor and any children produced by the union from the line of succession, due to the Act of Settlement of 1701.Â Â <br/>Â <br/>There is no indication that Alice and Walter Sickert knew one another, let alone engaged in an affair. Further,Â there is no indication that Sickert knew any member of the royal family, nor that he knew Annie. There is also no proof that he knew the victims of the Ripper, or that they knew each other or Annie. Even if they had known one another, the chances that their story of a royal illegitimacy would have been believed were fairly slim.Â <br/>Â <br/>Shortly after the book putting the claims forward, <i>Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution</i>, was published, Joseph Gorman retracted his testimony and admitted he had fabricated all of it. Nonetheless, the royal conspiracy theory has remained immensely popular, especially in popular fiction, where Annie most notably appeared as the Prince's secret wife in <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's </a><i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\">From Hell</a></i>. She also appeared in the film \"adaptation\", where she was portrayed by Joanna Page.Â ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Walter Sickert was born in Munich, the son of a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56518\" href=\"/denmark/4020-56518/\" slug=\"denmark\">Danish</a>-<a data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\" href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\" slug=\"germany\">German</a> artist. Between 1870 and 1871 he attended first University College School, and then King's College School where he remained until he was 18. Though he at first intended to be an actor, he soon turned to the study of art in 1881, attending the Slade Art School. In 1883 heÂ travelled to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56052\" href=\"/paris/4020-56052/\" slug=\"paris\">Paris</a> and met with Edgar Degas, who heavily influenced Sickert's work and with whom Sickert would remain friends until Degas' death. Sickert soon developed his own brand of Impressionism, utilizing sombre colours and themes that would characterize his later work. In these early years he spent most of his time living in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\" href=\"/france/4020-55778/\" slug=\"france\">France</a>, often with his mistress and, allegedly, his illegitimate son. 1884 was the date of his first show.Â In 1885 he was married, though by 1899 he was divorced, and spent much of his time in Dieppe and <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55737\" href=\"/venice/4020-55737/\" slug=\"venice\">Venice</a>. He was living in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a> at the time of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper </a>murders, and was convinced that he lived in the room once let by the Ripper, as had been suggested to him by his landlady. He created a painting, \"<i>Jack the Ripper's Bedroom</i>\", because of this. This macabre theme would continue on in his later works; after the 1907 murder of prostitute Emily Dimmick, Sickert created a painting Â \"<i>The Camden Town Murder</i>\" based on the event. This painting brought about a great deal of controversy, and ensured attention would be focused on Sickert's later works. Â Â <br/>Â <br/>In 1911 he and several other British painters formed the Camden Town Group, which had been meeting informally since 1905, when Sickert had first returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a>. In 1924 he became an associate of the Royal Academy, and ten years later an academician. Shortly afterwards, however, he resigned the position because of the views of the president on the works of Epstein. In 1941 he was given a solo show of his work at the National Gallery in London. He died a year later on January 22nd, 1942 at the age of 81.Â Â <br/><h3>Jack the Ripper?Â </h3>Sickert was first proposed as a suspect in the 1970s, where he was alleged to have been in some way complicit with the the so-called \"royal conspiracy\". In Jean Overtun Fuller's 1990 book <i>Sickert and the Ripper Crimes</i> was the first to suggest that Sickert himself was the killer. Patricia Cornwell suggested in her 2002 book <i>Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper- Case Closed</i> that she had established a DNA link between Sickert and one of the Ripper letters. This claim has never been conclusively substantiated, and most people view the Sickert theory as relatively weak. There is no solid evidence that ties him to the crime, and he was not considered as a suspect by contemporary investigations. As well, there is some evidence that suggests he was in France at the time of the murdersÂ ",

    "description": "<p> </p><h2>History</h2><p> </p><p> Not much is known about the mysterious Mr. Orr, and that's probably exactly the way he likes it. In his earlier appearances, <a href=\"/oracle/4005-5368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\"> Oracle</a> sent <a href=\"/karate-kid/4005-1269/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1269\"> Karate Kid</a> to see Mr. Orr for answers in treating his condition. Orr has worked for <a href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\"> Lex Luthor</a> in the past and seems to be answering to <a href=\"/desaad/4005-4681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4681\"> Desaad</a>. Mr. Orr runs a black-ops government organization that specializes in military intelligence and combat enhancements. To that end, Mr. Orr created <a href=\"/project-m/4060-56945/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56945\"> Project M</a>, an experimental program using <a href=\"/cyborg/4005-2388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2388\"> Cyborg</a>'s technology to create cybernetically enhanced super-soldiers.</p><p> The project resulted in the creations of the artificially created life force known as <a href=\"/equus/4005-46916/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46916\"> Equus</a>, as well as a group of cybernetically enhanced Wildebeest creatures. Cyborg's childhood friend <a href=\"/ron-evers/4005-62837/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62837\"> Ron Evers</a> became a test subject as well and was fused with a frame of enforced molybdenum steel and special polymers, much like Cyborg. The implants could also be controlled by Mr. Orr, should a subject start to disobey orders.</p><p> </p><p> Evers became an unwilling killing machine and was sent overseas for a series of field tests in the Middle East. After witnessing the atrocities of war, Ron returned to the and attempted to resign his commission with Project M. Mr. Orr rejected Ron's resignation, leaving the embittered soldier to seek revenge against the people who made him a cyborg. After destroying several S.T.A.R. Labs facilities that sponsored Project M, Evers attacked <a href=\"/sarah-charles/4005-5303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5303\"> Sarah Charles</a> and her fiancee, DeShaun, for their role as scientists in the project. Ron's aggressions were halted by Cyborg and the <a href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\"> Teen Titans</a>.</p><p> </p><p> In the wake of this attack, Mr. Orr pulled in Victor Stone from 10 years in the future! This future Victor - known as Cyborg 2.0 - was convinced to help Orr in an effort to preserve his own timeline. To stop Cyborg from exposing the secrets of Project M, Orr organized a team he dubbed the \"<a href=\"/cyborg-revenge-squad/4060-56612/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56612\"> Cyborg Revenge Squad</a>.\" Led by Cyborg 2.0, this group was comprised of <a href=\"/cyborgirl/4005-10884/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10884\"> Cyborgirl</a>, <a href=\"/magenta/4005-10461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10461\"> Magenta</a>, <a href=\"/gizmo/4005-5311/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5311\"> Gizmo II</a>, <a href=\"/girder/4005-5717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5717\"> Girder</a>, <a href=\"/shrapnel/4005-2546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2546\"> Shrapnel</a> and <a href=\"/thinker/4005-23851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23851\"> The Thinker</a> - a team specially designed to take down Cyborg.</p><p> </p><p> The Cyborg Revenge Squad tried to prevent Victor Stone from exposing Mr. Orr's Project M - and that meant executing <a href=\"/the-phantom-limbs/4060-56581/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56581\"> The Phantom Limbs</a>, who were living proof of the program. But Cyborg defeated the Revenge Squad and saved The Phantom Limbs by initiating a backdoor program left by his father. This program made any cybernetics derived from <a href=\"/silas-stone/4005-27660/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27660\"> Silas Stone</a>'s work compatible only with Victor's DNA. Sarah Charles and DeShaun also resigned from the project, setting back's Orr's developments substantially. This put an end to Project M - at least for now.</p><p> </p>",

    "deck": "Equus is a  cyborg mercenary.  He has had run-ins with Superman in the past and  is currently the bodyguard to Mr. Orr.",
    "description": "<p>Equus was a prototype for the OMAC Project, he and Superman combated each other during \"The Vanishing\", where one million people disappeared from Earth along with Lois Lane. The Vanishing occurred somewhere in the Middle East. During his investigation, Supermanâs encounter with Equus was a bit more than he could chew since Equusâ claws were actually capable of slicing through Superman's skin. The fight between them ended when General Nox, a leader of a rebellion that was taking place in the Middle East, deactivated Equus. Nox informs Superman that the King in a certain section of the Middle East used a peculiar device which caused The Vanishing. Superman stands down for a moment until he learns that Nox will execute King along with his family and members of the Kingâs cabinet. Superman tells Nox that the king must stand trial but Nox decides to reactivate Equus. Supermanâs rematch with Equus turned out better when he ripped Equus' right arm, and defeated him.</p><p>Superman then turns his attention to Nox but Equus was down and out yet. Nox was impressed by Supermanâs determination so he orders Equus to stand down but Equus refused to acknowledge Noxâs orders anymore. Equus informs Nox that he was paid to aid the generalâs rebellion just so he can get close to the device. Equus maneuvers past Superman and takes the device from Nox. Equus activates the device and he disappears along with 300,000 more people from the planet. Superman returns to the Fortress of Solitude and learns that the device acts as a Phantom Zone projector but the device transports people to a place called Metropia, a paradise dimension that is an exact opposite of the Phantom Zone. Superman also learns from Emil Hamilton that his colleague Elias Orr made Equus psychotic by enlarging his amygdale in order to subject Equus to cybernetic enhancements. This process that Orr conducted on Equus became common practice for candidates in the OMAC Project. Superman recreates the same dimensional rift to Metropia and discovers the Vanishing victims are being tormented by Equus along with General Zod. Superman defeats Zod and shuts down Equus by exposing structural weaknesses in Equusâ cybernetic enhancements with his X-ray vision.</p><p>Orr rebuilds Equus at a decommissioned Nebraska Air Force base in Fort Halprin. Equus now acts as Orrâs errand boy/ bodyguard. When Orr learns that Karate Kid and Triplicate Girl are near his secret base of operations, Orr is told by his benefactor Desaad, to have Equus kill the two heroes. Equus tracked the heroes to a train that was heading to Benkelman, Nebraska so he severs apart of the railroad in order to cause a derailment. Fortunately, Supergirl was in the area and she managed to prevent the derailment with Triplicate Girl. As for Karate Kid, he defeated Equus when he sliced one of Equusâ arms off with a powerful karate chop. Equusâ arm was reattached by Orr and in response to Equusâ failure; Orr sends a prototype OMAC that resembles Buddy Blank to destroy Karate Kid but this mission turns out to be a failure since Karate Kid returned to his own time with Triplicate Girl. Later on, Orr clones Equus and Wildebeest to create a small battalion that distracts the Teen Titans from aiding Cyborg who was being beaten by the Cyborg Revenge Squad. Cyborg and the Teen Titans were victorious in defeating Orr along with his cybernetic monsters but Equus makes another appearance during Prometheusâ last stand against the Justice League.</p><h3>Powers &amp; Abilities</h3><p>Equus is part of the OMAC project because of this he possesses several powers &amp; abilities such as Superhuman Strength as he has been shown picking up a rail road car with no efforts and wielding it as a melee weapon. He also has a regeneration factor as he can recover from major wounds including severed limbs. Equus also possesses five claws which extend from his knuckles and they are even capable of piercing Superman's skin.</p>",

However even though she was a potential that didn't mean she was going to make a good slayer like the slayer after Buffy Faith she was sick and twisted and could not be helped.<p>She has been kidnapping girls and hunting them calling it a \"foxhunt\" including a newly called slayer.Â <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20097\" href=\"/giles/4005-20097/\" slug=\"giles\">Rupert Giles</a> aware of this fact chose to go down a darker path and decided not try and fix her but get rid of her. Instead of going to Buffy with this or any of the other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41140\" href=\"/scooby-gang/4060-41140/\" slug=\"scooby-gang\">Scoobies </a>he asked Faith to kill her.

Faith makes it pass the security and even acts the part of snooty girl with too much money. However Faith is feeling different about killing Genevieve and even though she has a knife in her hand she pulled from her hair she is nervous about the assassination and soon <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49034\" href=\"/roden/4005-49034/\" slug=\"roden\">Roden</a> Genevieve's irish warlock watcher uses Gargoyles to watch Faith.<p>Unable to do the deed Faith goes outside to get a smoke but while she's their Genevieve sneaks up and joins her. Faith begins to talk to her under an assumed name (Hope Lyonne). She tries to kill Gigi again but this time the Gargoyles show up and stop her. But Faith was able to kill the beast but she passes out after the fight. Roden and Gig take her back to Gigi's home. Roden thinks that she is to dangerous.</p><h2>Kill the Queen</h2><p>Â But Genevieve actually became fond of Faith and wanted her to join her in her bid to become \"Queen of the Slayers\" and kill Buffy not the queen of england like she originally thought. Faith (still under her assumed name) and Gigi become great friend thinking of killing Buffy. The two even take a bath together. During Faith notices that Giles really wasn't sending her on a mission to save the world but just to save Buffy but she wanted to still kill Genevieve.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14661/446065-genfaith.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-446065\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1422319474836\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14661/446065-genfaith.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-446065\"><img alt=\"Gigi vs Faith\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14661/446065-genfaith.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14661/446065-genfaith.jpg 914w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14661/446065-genfaith.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Gigi vs Faith\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14661/446065-genfaith.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14661/446065-genfaith.jpg 914w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14661/446065-genfaith.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gigi vs Faith</figcaption></figure>However Giles soon began to believe he had lost control of Faith and she was really working with Genevieve. Soon Genevieve and Roden used a spell to bring Buffy to them from her base in Scotland. She starts to fight Buffy but loses due to Buffy's better years of training and combat.Â Faith's true identity was eventually exposed after Genevieve made her failed attempt on Buffy's life and Buffy did almost die by Faith's hands during the fight but she was able to calm down and Willow teleported Buffy back whoÂ immediatelyÂ wanted to speak with Giles.Â <p>Genevieve wasÂ devastatedÂ by Faith's betrayal and the two slayers fought. The fight carriers on to the greenhouse while Faith tries to get Genevieve to leave Roden and work with her but she will not listen and is being stubborn. Gig even jams her axe in a tree and tries to take on Faith herself but after a vicious battle and a kick to the stomach Faith accidently impaled Genevieve on her axe. Roden refused to heal her wanting to replace her with Faith and causing her to die.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Powers</h2><p>As a slayer she has all the usual powers of a slayer. She has increased strength and speed enough to kill most types of demons and vampires. She would experience the normal visions that a slayer would have telling her of her past as a member of the slayer line. She was no doubt trained in combat and weapon use by her warlock watch Roden and was seen able to fight Buffy for some time despite her experience and years of practice.Â <br/></p>",

Galactus, being born in the universe before this one, knew of a race of beings that could defeat not only The Adjudicator, but also the Cosmic Tribunal. This race of beings, called the Decimators, lived a thousand universes away and was a completely mindless race of beings that existed only on instincts; instincts to kill. Being totally devoid of thought, the Decimators were immune to the thought powers of the members of the Cosmic Tribunal. Upon learning of the Tribunal's existence; The Decimators set out to destroy them. The Adjudicator sensed his brethren being attacked and teleported to the Tribunal to help fend off the Decimators. Galactus transported himself, The Silver Surfer, and The Fantastic Four to the Tribunal to aid The Adjudicator in his home worldâs battle. With the help of the World Devourer and his \"comrades\", the Cosmic Tribunal defeated The Decimators. The Cosmic Tribunal decided that their decision to eradicate the human race had been in error and left the world to its own devices.</span></p><p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; \"><span><br/></span></p> <p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; padding:0in; \"><span></span></p><p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; padding:0in; \"><span></span><b><span style=\"font-size:18pt; \">Physical Characteristics/Powers</span></b></p> <div style=\"padding:0in 0in 1pt; \"> </div> <p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; \"><span>Estimated at 22,000 feet tall; The Adjudicator is virtually omnipotent.

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>History</h2><p>Two young men calling themselves Thunder and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9545\" href=\"/lightning/4005-9545/\" slug=\"lightning\">Lightning</a> were causing major disturbances in St. Louis with their super-powers. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\" href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\" slug=\"teen-titans\">Titans</a> were summoned to deal with this menace. After a short battle, the Teen Titans learned the two brothers - Gan and Tavis Williams - were searching for their father, Second Lt. Walter Williams. Thunder and Lightning revealed that they are the offspring of American soldier Walter Williams and a Vietnamese mother. As children, they began to manifest strange abilities, controlling thunder and lightning. A wise China man named Chan To urged the brothers to seek out their father - he sensed that was the key to harnessing their sometimes-uncontrollable powers.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-10885\" href=\"/wonder-girl/4005-10885/\" slug=\"wonder-girl\">Wonder Girl</a> discovered that their father had been missing for almost 20 years, following a laboratory accident. The brothers decided to settle at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-30759\" href=\"/star-labs/4020-30759/\" slug=\"star-labs\">S.T.A.R. Labs</a>, where, hopefully, they could learn to control their powers more efficiently.</p><p>A few months later, the Titans and S.T.A.R. Labs tried fruitlessly to find a cure for Thunder and Lightning's powers. At this time, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3584\" href=\"/raven/4005-3584/\" slug=\"raven\">Raven</a> used her soul self to learn more about their missing father through Gan and Tavis' subconscious. Raven unlocked the secrets of their origins: The man who called himself Walter Williams was actually an extraterrestrial; his ship crashed in Vietnam 600 years ago; He returned to the crash site under the guise of Walter Williams to retrieve his spaceship. There, he met and fell in love with the Vietnamese woman who would be Thunder and Lightning's mother. Now, with Raven's help, the Titans and Thunder and Lightning were able to locate the alien father, who was being held prisoner by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-33317\" href=\"/hive/4060-33317/\" slug=\"hive\">H.I.V.E</a>. The H.I.V.E. had been holding the alien prisoner for years, exploiting his knowledge and abilities for their own purposes. Under the H.I.V.E.'s control, the alien attacked the Titans and his sons. The battle ended tragically: Thunder and Lightning were forced to kill their own father. </p><a href=\"///\"></a><h3>S.T.A.R. Labs</h3><p>With their father's blood sample, however, S.T.A.R. Labs was able to cure Thunder and Lightning, allowing them to control their abilities at last. After this, the brothers returned to their motherland. Sometime after this, the brothers returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, still searching for ways to rein in their powers.</p><p>The brothers eventually relocated to the S.T.A.R. Lab located in San Francisco. As Gan and Tavis learned to master their abilities, they also provided security for S.T.A.R. Labs.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h3>Trigon Seeds</h3><p>While stopping a robbery, Thunder and Lightning came into conflict with Raven, whose dark soul had been reborn in the image of her father. Raven was trying to plant the demon seeds of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5310\" href=\"/trigon/4005-5310/\" slug=\"trigon\">Trigon</a>'s unborn children into suitable host bodies. Raven sought out Thunder and Lightning and used their bodies as hosts for these seeds of Trigon. </p><a href=\"///\"></a><h3>Technis Imperative</h3><p>It appears as though Thunder and Lightning were able to free themselves as well. They have since appeared to aid the Titans during their encounter with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">Justice League</a>, who were trying to stop former Titans member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2388\" href=\"/cyborg/4005-2388/\" slug=\"cyborg\">Cyborg</a> (formerly Cyborg, then transformed into Cyberion) </p><p>Freed from the evil influence of the seeds of Trigon, the super-powered Thunder and Lightning have returned to their home country in Southern Vietnam, reportedly to defend it from an unknown alien threat</p><h3><a data-ref-id=\"4050-20239\" href=\"/salvation-run/4050-20239/\" slug=\"salvation-run\">Salvation Run</a></h3><p>Thunder was sent to planet <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55870\" href=\"/hell-planet/4020-55870/\" slug=\"hell-planet\">Salvation</a>. While trying to help the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\" href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" slug=\"martian-manhunter\">Martian Manhunter</a>, he was captured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6129\" href=\"/bane/4005-6129/\" slug=\"bane\">Bane</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\" href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" slug=\"lex-luthor\">Lex Lutho</a>r used him to power the teleporter. Thunder was presumably killed when the teleporter exploded.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Thunder is able to control thunder, which he manifests as rumbling noise, which he can control to varying degrees. Gan also possesses super strength. </p><p>He also shares a psychic link, and is able to communicate telepathically with his brother.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Other Media</h2><p>Thunder appear with Lightning in the teen titans animated series. In the show they are seemingly supernatural brothers who just want to have fun, but they make life miserable for everyone else with their disregard for the safety of others. Their powers are thunderous sound blasts and lightning bolts respectively. When they combine their powers, they can cause rain. Thunder is rather large, has a deep voice, and wears blue samurai armor.</p><p>Slade, tricked Thunder and Lightning into setting fire to some posts which created a giant fire monster bent on destroying the city. It was stopped when Thunder and Lightning joined their powers to make it rain, therefore putting out the Fire.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2><p>Revan was created in the 2003 RPG <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/3030-18741/\"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em></a> video game as the main playable character. His story was expanded upon in the 2005 sequel <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-/3030-8852/\"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords </em></a>and the 2011 novelization <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic: Revan</em>.

The character has become a fan favorite in the Star Wars expanded universe, sporting cameos and mentions in various other works such as the 2006 novelization <em>Star Wars: Darth Bane: Path of Destruction</em> and the 2006 to 2010 <a href=\"/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/4050-18937/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18937\"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em></a> comic series.</p><h2>Character Summary</h2><h3>Early Years and Training</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"Revan had many Masters, Zhar, Dorak, Master Kae before Kae left for the Wars. Toward the end of his training, he sought out many to learn techniques. It is said that he returned to his first Master at the end of his training, in order to learn how he might best leave the Order.\"</em></p> âJedi Scholar Mical</blockquote><p>Revan was believed to have been born 3,994 years before the <a href=\"/battle-of-yavin/4015-45961/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-45961\">Battle of Yavin</a> somewhere in the Outer Rim Territories. He was taken to be a Jedi at an early age and was apprenticed to <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/darth-traya/4005-121183/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121183\">Kreia</a>, who would eventually go on to become Darth Traya.

Revan went on to study under many others alongside his friend <a href=\"/darth-malak/4005-47892/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47892\">Alek</a>, and mastered everything the other masters had to offer as well. He quickly became the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jedi-order/4060-41234/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41234\">Jedi Order</a>'s most promising pupil, much to the caution of the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-jedi-high-council/4060-45051/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45051\">Jedi Council</a> who sensed something deeper.

Eventually, they moved inward and began conquering some of the Outer Rim Territories and <a href=\"/hutts/4060-56806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56806\">Hutt</a> Space. Among the battles included the Battle of Cathar, in which Cassus Fett ordered the mass genocide that almost completely wiped out the Cathar population. Eventually the Senate ordered the <a href=\"/galactic-republic/4060-51880/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51880\">Galactic Republic</a> military, under <a href=\"/admiral-saul-karath/4005-50911/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50911\">Saul Karath</a>, to intervene, causing skirmishes to erupt on numerous fronts. Revan began to call for Jedi intervention in the war, rallying fellow young Jedi to his cause under the banner of the \"Jedi Crusaders\" to end the threat. The Jedi Council, however, condoned Revan's actions, believing the Jedi should not get involved in the war.</p><h3>The Mandalorian Wars</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"The Mandalorian Wars were a series of massacres that masked another war, a war of conversion.

There they experienced a Force Vision that showed them the atrocities committed by the Mandalorians. In outrage, Revan picked up a fallen Mandalorian mask, donned it, and swore that he would not remove it until the Mandalorians were defeated forever. Pressing the Jedi Council's hand, Revan's movement was sanctioned and jumped into space, saving the shipyards of Duro from complete Mandalorian destruction in 3,962 BBY. Following the battle, Revan was named Supreme Commander of the Galactic Republic's military. A master tactician, Revan began pushing back the Mandalorian armies alongside his right-hand man Malak, formerly known as Alek.</p><p>As the war waged on, Revan continued to sacrifice his morals for victory, drawing closer and closer to the dark side. However, the Mandalorians respected him for this, believing that he was worthy advisory and among the greatest military leaders in history. Eventually, Revan came across the world of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/malachor-v/3035-773/\">Malachor V</a>, where he discovered a treasure of Sith artifacts. Revan embraced the dark side willingly, believing that its power was needed for ultimate victory. After studying the teachings of the ancient Sith who came before him, he orchestrated a plot where he would lure the Mandalorians into a great battle above Malachor V, in which he would completely eradicate their armies and seduce his fleet with the terrible energies of the dark side. Revan kept his true plans a secret.</p><p>Later, on the moon of Dxun, a long battle waged between the Jedi, led by Revan and fellow companion <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/jedi-exile/3005-995/\">Meetra Surik</a>. Revan drew out the conflict and put his soldiers in harm's way, believing that the trials they would endure would make them more susceptible to the dark side and easier to corrupt. Following the victory, Revan continued his push, eventually reaching his goal world of Malachor V. There, he split his fleet into two, sending first an army led by Meetra Surik consisting of all of those not loyal to him. Then came his supporters, who turned the tide of the battle. In the chaos, Revan slew Mandalore the Ultimate in single combat, activated a super weapon that destroyed the surface of the planet along with all the remaining Mandalorians, and corrupted the surviving Jedi under his command.</p><h3>The Second Sith War</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"Three years ago, Revan and Malak returned at the head of a massive invasion fleet. Revan had assumed the title of Sith Lord; the hero had become a conqueror.\"</em></p> âJedi Master Dorak</blockquote><p>Following the victory, the galaxy hailed Revan and Malak as the saviors of the galaxy. However, none could have expected what Revan did next. First, he exiled Meetra Surik, now a shattered Jedi after close exposure to the destruction Malachor V, back to the Jedi Council to show them the hypocrisy of their teachings. Then, his fleet parted into the Unknown Regions. Before Mandalore the Ultimate's death, the Mandalorian had revealed that it had not been his choice to go to war with the galaxy, and rather a Sith came to him with a prophecy. Revan and Malak searched for this Sith, coming across numerous worlds before finding the new <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-sith/4060-44460/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44460\">Sith Empire</a>'s hidden capital of Dromund Kaas.

However, Vitiate had been informed ahead of time of the Jedi's plot, and he quickly dominated them with his power. He turned them into servants of his will, christened them as Darth Revan and Darth Malak, and sent them back out to be the vanguard of his fleet and find an ancient factory called the <a href=\"/star-forge/4020-57543/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57543\">Star Forge</a>. Revan and Malak's willpower was greater than he anticipated, however, and they quickly broke free of his control. They found the Star Forge and used it to create a massive army of warships to invade the Galactic Republic on their own wishes. They planned on conquering the galaxy so that they could unify it to prepare it against Vitiate's armies.</p><p>Revan and Malak, with a new fleet and millions of fallen Jedi behind them, suddenly reappeared to the galaxy in 3,958 BBY, forcing the galaxy into the Jedi Civil War. Revan established a Sith Academy on <a href=\"/korriban/4020-57442/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57442\">Korriban</a> to train hopeful recruits, strengthening his army. Due to Revan's familiarity with the enemy's tactics, and the fact that countless worlds joined his cause without a fight due to his actions in the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi and the Galactic Republic were immediately taken aback on the defensive and lost battle after battle. Revan additionally orchestrated the assassination of numerous political figures, including Yusanis of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/echani/3015-2769/\">Echani</a>, and planted his own men in their place. He also instituted a sect of deadly Sith Assassins that would capture and corrupt Jedi mindlessly to the dark side of the Force.</p><p>Darth Malak, however, soon began to have his own ambitions. He viewed Revan as weak and unfit to be the ruler of the Sith Empire. Tension soon escalated into a lightsaber duel where Revan cut off Malak's jaw, forcing him to wear a metal prosthetic jaw. Also realizing that if they did not act quickly all hope of recovery would be lost, the Jedi Council soon after lured Revan and Malak into a trap. <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bastila-shan/4005-56320/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56320\">Bastila Shan</a> and a Jedi strike team infiltrated Revan's capital ship in effort to capture him. Seizing advantage of Revan's momentary distraction, Malak fired upon Revan's ship, nearly killing Revan. Bastila Shan, the only Jedi survivor, healed Revan's injuries and brought him back before the Jedi Council for judgment. With Revan believed dead, Darth Malak declared himself the undisputed Dark Lord of the Sith.</p><h3>Knights of the Old Republic</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"Savior, conqueror, hero, villain. You are all things Revanâ¦ and yet you are nothing. In the end you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone.\"</em></p> âSith Lord Darth Malak</blockquote><p>After the capture of Darth Revan and his transfer back to the Jedi Council, the combined might of the masters used the Force to erase the former Dark Lord's memories. They knew Revan was the only one powerful enough to destroy Darth Malak and the Sith, and thus they planned on recreating him as a weapon to unleash against them. They trained his new identity as a Jedi Knight, forcing him to undergo trials on the hidden world of <a href=\"/dantooine/4020-57743/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57743\">Dantooine</a>. After successfully completing the task, the Jedi Council sent out Revan and Bastila Shan to discover the location of the Star Forge by finding Star Maps located across the galaxy. When all the maps were found, the location of the Star Forge would be revealed to them. Revan was originally unaware of the Jedi's scheme, not knowing he was formerly a Sith Lord.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5113485\" data-ratio=\"0.53125\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.1%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5113485\"><img alt=\"The redeemed Revan in battle.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg 800w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The redeemed Revan in battle.\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg 800w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113485-revan.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The redeemed Revan in battle.</figcaption></figure><p>Revan and Bastila Shan soon assembled a team along their journey as they traveled across <a href=\"/tatooine/4020-45967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45967\">Tatooine</a>, <a href=\"/manaan/4020-57553/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57553\">Manaan</a>, and Kashyyk looking for the Star Maps, helping and killing many individuals along the way. Their accomplishments did not go unnoticed, however, and soon they were captured by Darth Malak and <a href=\"/admiral-saul-karath/4005-50911/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50911\">Saul Karath</a>. In a dramatic showdown, Darth Malak revealed to Revan that he was formerly \"Darth\" Revan, much to the Jedi's surprise. Revan and Darth Malak fought, leading to Bastila Shan's capture by the Sith. Darth Malak had a particular interest in Bastila Shan because she had mastered the rare art of Battle Mediation, which allowed her to boost the power and skills of entire fleets through the Force. Through the power of the Force, Darth Malak quickly seduced Bastila Shan to become his apprentice.</p><p>Revan and his crew continued on their mission, however. They infiltrated the Sith Academy on Korriban and eliminated all enemies there, driving the Sith off the planet for centuries to come. With the final Star Map found on Korriban, Revan traveled to the Star Forge. There, he was confronted first by Bastila Shan, who revealed her new allegiance to the Sith Empire. Revan redeemed her back to the light and the two confessed their love for one another. Revan went on to confront Darth Malak at the heart of the space station. An epic battle between the light and the dark followed, resulting in the defeat of Revan's former friend. In his final words, Darth Malak expressed regret for what he had done. Soon after, the Star Forge itself was destroyed with the Galactic Republic's final fleet, ending the terrible Sith threat.</p><h3>Into the Unknown Regions</h3><blockquote><p><em>âI am Revan reborn, and before me you are nothing.â</em></p> âJedi Master Revan</blockquote><p>Years later, Revan lived with his now-wife Bastila Shan on <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/coruscant/4020-48936/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-48936\">Coruscant</a>. Whereas once Revan had been the Dark Lord of the Sith, he was now officially a redeemed Jedi Master hailed as the \"Prodigal Knight.\" Despite amending his wrongs by destroying the Sith Empire he had created, the Jedi Council still feared his power and despised him. Revan had his own issues, however. Not all of his memories had fully returned, and he began to have visions of a mysterious world shrouded in darkness and lightning. Believing that the fate of the galaxy was at risk, Revan set out alongside his companion <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/canderous-ordo/3005-1852/\">Canderous Ordo</a>, a Mandalorian who served with him against Darth Malak, to find the truth of this lost world. He left behind Bastila Shan, now pregnant with his only son, believing he may not return.</p><p>Revan's adventure soon led him to Rekkiad, where he gave Canderous Ordo the mask of Mandalore the Ultimate. He told Canderous Ordo to resurrect the Mandalorians he had once destroyed because more soldiers may be needed for a great war yet to come. Canderous Ordo would go on to become Mandalore the Preserver and rebuild the clans. Retracing his lost footsteps, Revan then went to the planet of Nathema. The world was completely void of the Force due to a Sith ritual conducted by the Sith Emperor Vitiate centuries prior that granted him immortality. Revan's ship was ambushed by members of Vitiate's Sith Empire. Revan survived the crash landing, but was captured.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5113498\" data-ratio=\"1.0776209677419\" data-width=\"992\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 992px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.8%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5113498\"><img alt=\"Revan beyond known space.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" data-width=\"593\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg 992w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg 890w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg 593w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Revan beyond known space.\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg 992w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg 890w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113498-3532999970-483851.jpeg 593w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" data-width=\"593\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Revan beyond known space.</figcaption></figure><p>Revan was held in a prison on <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/dromund-kaas/3035-3720/\">Dromund Kaas</a>, the shadowy world he had seen in his visions, for years. Unaware to the Galactic Republic and the other Jedi, another Sith Empire lurked beyond known space with thousands of Sith ready for combat. Revan developed a close bond with his captor, the Sith <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/lord-scourge/3005-22342/\">Lord Scourge</a>, eventually persuading him to join him in his fight against the Sith Emperor Vitiate. Revan's former general during the Mandalorian Wars, Meetra Surik, came to the world and freed him. Meetra Surik, also now known as the Jedi Exile, had been on a journey of her own for the last ten years. She had regained her connection to the Force lost during the destruction of Malachor V, and defeated a splinter group of Sith who rose from the ashes of Revan's Sith Empire, led by his former master Kreia.</p><p>Revan and Meetra Surik, with the help of Scourge, devised a plan to assassinate the Sith Emperor. Scourge agreed to him them believing that a war against the Galactic Republic, which Vitiate planned, would result in the total annihilation of their Sith Empire. As Revan and Malak had done a decade earlier, the three confronted the Sith Emperor in his throne room. Revan waged a fierce battle against the dark master but was eventually overwhelmed. With the aid of his companions, Revan healed his injuries and stood again, ready to fight once more. At that moment, Scourge had a vision that revealed the trio would not win in their battle, and rather another Jedi in the future would. In an effort to save his own life, Scourge betrayed the two by killing Meetra Surik, allowing Vitiate to capture Revan once more.</p><h3>Fall into Darkness</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"The Emperor is death - for you, for me, for the galaxy!â</em></p> âJedi Master Revan</blockquote><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5333237\" data-ratio=\"1.2816901408451\" data-width=\"781\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 781px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.2%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5333237\"><img alt=\"Revan freed from his prison.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" data-width=\"499\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest 781w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest 749w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest 499w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Revan freed from his prison.\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest 781w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest 749w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5333237-8881527750-latest 499w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" data-width=\"499\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Revan freed from his prison.</figcaption></figure><p>With his life prolonged by Sith alchemy, Revan was imprisoned in stasis for three hundred years. With the Force, the Sith Emperor ravaged his mind, seeking information and power. Revan resisted his efforts, however, with the aid of Meetra Surik's spirit. Revan also used his unique connection with Vitiate to influence him to postpone the war he had planned for centuries. Eventually, when the time for the Great Galactic War came, Revan then persuaded the Sith Emperor to agree to the terms of the Treaty of Courscant, which still allowed the Galactic Republic to have half the galaxy. When tensions began rising again, an ally strike force freed Revan, believing he could help the war effort. However, during his time in captivity, Revan's mind became consumed by hatred for his captor, and he plotted revenge.</p><p>Following his release, Revan went to the Foundry, a space station similar to the Star Forge he had destroyed so many years prior. With the Foundry, Revan planned on creating an army of war droids that would eliminate trillions of beings with Sith genetic material, believing them all to be abominations. Among the dead, of course, would be his tormentor Vitiate. His plan never came into fruition, for another strike force of the Sith Empire's finest warriors confronted and killed Revan. However, Revan's will was so strong that, in death, his mind split into two. While his light side embraced the Force, a darker side fueled by vengeance against Vitiate overcame death and resurrected his own body from the dead. The dark Revan vowed that he would not die until the Sith Emperor was forever ridden from the galaxy.</p><h3>The Shadow of Revan</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"War is coming. Conflict on a scale we've never seen. Revan has forged an army with a single purpose - to change the galaxy forever. Empire. Republic. We must unite, or fall.\"</em></p> âThe Coalition Strike Force</blockquote><p>Due to Revan's accomplishments, a cult was founded in his honor known as the Order of Revan. Behind the scenes, the returned Revan expanded the cult to a galactic power with thousands of followers. A few years later, Revan revealed himself once more as the group's leader. He believed that all distractions must be swept aside so that the galaxy, and himself, could solely focus on eliminating the Sith Emperor. Revan and his followers tried to create an army of cyborgs fueled by the remains of the Star Forge. However, a joint task force stopped their efforts. Next, they attempted to lure the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire fleets above Rishi so that they could destroy each other and allow Revan to pick off the remaining survivors, thus making his faction the galaxy's sole power. They were stopped once again.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113511-1933185301-maxre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5113511\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113511-1933185301-maxre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5113511\"><img alt=\"\"Vengeance will be mine!\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113511-1933185301-maxre.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5113511-1933185301-maxre.jpg 1280w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111140132/5113511-1933185301-maxre.jpg 960w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111140132/5113511-1933185301-maxre.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5113511-1933185301-maxre.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Vengeance will be mine!\"</figcaption></figure><p>Unfazed, Revan continued his crazed crusade. The Sith Emperor had been slain by a Jedi named the Hero of Tython three years prior, but his spirit remained. Revan planned on resurrecting Vitiate's spirit on Yavin IV so that he could destroy him once and for all. The Galactic Republic and Sith Empire agreed to a temporary ceasefire so that they could end Revan's plan before it was too late, believing that his meddling would only result in Vitiate's return to the galaxy, and thus certain death to all. Even the Sith despised Vitiate, believing their former ruler wanted nothing more than to see the galaxy be consumed to fuel his bid for infinite power The joint factions, led by the Hero of Tython, the current Sith Empire leader <a href=\"/darth-marr/4005-86375/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86375\">Darth Marr</a>, and Jedi Grand Master <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/satele-shan/4005-72030/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72030\">Satele Shan</a>, confronted and defeated Revan. Fueled by all the death waged by Revan's war, the Sith Emperor still returned more powerful than ever before.</p><p>In the spectacle, the light side spirit of Revan that was killed on the Foundry years prior appeared before the part of himself that refused to die. The physical Revan believed he had failed his mission, but the spirit of Revan remarked that they were broken and that they cannot go on until they become whole again. Realizing how far he had fallen and what his struggle for revenge had cost, the darker Revan's anger subsided, eventually agreeing to bind back with his light self, finally finding peace in the Force. In his final worlds, Revan told the coalition forces that they must prepare against the threat that Vitiate posed to all, and prophesied that the darkest days still lied ahead, so to brace for the worst.</p><h3>Legacy of a Legend</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"Who I am is not important, my message is.\"</em></p> âJedi Master Revan</blockquote><p>While Revan's final years were marked with chaos, he was remembered by Sith and Jedi alike as among the most influential, legendary, and powerful figures in history. Revan's triumph over the Mandalorians was even felt thousands of years later when they still found themselves to be shadows of their former selves. Likewise, the remnants of the <a href=\"/rakatans/4060-58962/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58962\">Rakata</a> ended with Revan, alongside the mighty Echani warriors. His leadership and command of the Galactic Republic military made it a legitimate fighting force capable of fighting threats like Vitiate's Sith Empire. Thousands of years after his death, a Sith named himself Darth Rivan based on a corrupt manuscript about Revan. Also, Revan's Sith philosophy and teachings would later be adopted by the infamous Darth Bane, who used his dark techniques to destroy the Brotherhood of Darkness and reform the Sith into the Rule of Two, which led to the rise of Palpatine.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Combat Skills</h3><blockquote><p>\"<i>You, Revan, are the single greatest warrior of this age, and any battle we fight will bring me honor.</i>\"<br />âMandalore Canderous Ordo</p></blockquote><p>Even at an early age, Revan's insatiable hunger for knowledge and mastery over the Jedi arts drove him to be the Order's most powerful champion against the Mandalorian threat. In his prime, Revan was an unstoppable force on the battlefield, a master of multiple forms of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lightsaber/4055-44097/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\">lightsaber</a> combat, and regarded by many as the greatest warrior of his age. He accumulated respect from a vast range of different cultures from the Mandalorians to the Echani - the Rakata to the ancient Sith. However, despite his skills, he was unable to overcome the numerous powerful strike teams that challenged him later in life, nor the conflicts rising and tearing him apart within his very own heart and soul, thus leading to his downfall.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5118755\" data-ratio=\"0.53464499572284\" data-width=\"1169\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1169px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.5%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5118755\"><img alt=\"Revan fighting the Mandalorians.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest 1169w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Revan fighting the Mandalorians.\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest 1169w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest 960w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111140132/5118755-3416601310-latest 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Revan fighting the Mandalorians.</figcaption></figure><p>As a Jedi Padawan, Revan apprenticed himself to many masters, including Kreia, learning everything they had to teach him. He soon thereafter went off to war, demonstrating his skills with blaster deflection as he battled the Mandalorians and their Basilisk war droids, killing so many that he was regarded as \"Revan the Butcher.\" At the end of the war, Revan challenged and slew Mandalore the Ultimate in single-combat. Following the battle, the Mandalorians remarked that if Revan had been born Mandalorian, no one in the galaxy could have stopped them. Despite being the architect of their defeat, they still believed him to be the greatest warrior in the Galactic Republic's history.</p><p>In his adventures exploring the Unknown Regions, Revan slew raiding parties of primitive Rakata, making them believe he was a great warrior sent from the sky to save them. When war between Revan's newly formed Sith Empire and the Jedi Order erupted, it was said that Revan killed many Jedi and Echani in battle. Despite the Echani being butchered, they still respected him for it, believing he had perfected their arts and Battle Precognition. Revan's mastery in the art of Battle Precognition was rumored to allow him to predict attacks before they happened, the course of battles, and the path of entire wars. Yusanis, the greatest warrior of the Echani, was one of the many victims to Revan's blade.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118765-untitled.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5118765\" data-ratio=\"1.404\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.4%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118765-untitled.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5118765\"><img alt=\"Revan triumphant in battle.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118765-untitled.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118765-untitled.png 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Revan triumphant in battle.\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118765-untitled.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118765-untitled.png 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Revan triumphant in battle.</figcaption></figure><p>Following his mind-wipe at the hands of the Jedi Council, Revan was forged into a weapon that would be unleashed upon the Sith Empire he created, focusing on physical training and lightsaber mastery. Across his travels he defeated many enemies, including the famous bounty hunter Calo Nord and the apprentice to Darth Malak, Darth Bandon. During his stay on Korriban trying to locate the Star Map, Revan single-handedly slew two terentatek, the Sith headmasters Uthar Wynn and Yuthura Ban, and then the entirety of the Sith Academy consisting of dozens of Sith acolytes and masters. So thorough was the massacre that it took the Sith three-thousand years to fully reclaim the world again.</p><p>When Revan returned to the Rakata homeworld of Lehon, he and his companions were forced to face a thousand of the One's finest warriors before defeating him as well in battle, protected by four rancors. Revan, with the aid of Jolee Bindo and Juhani, then went into the Temple of Ancients, facing great opposition along the way with many Dark Jedi confronting them, including Bastila Shan. On the Star Forge, Revan fought through armies of Sith war droids, Dark Jedi, and Sith Apprentices in a spectacle that was said to have went on for over an hour before once again defeating Bastila Shan. Without rest, he then killed Darth Malak, a highly accomplished swordsman and master of the Force, ending the Sith Empire.</p><h3>Force Powers</h3><blockquote><p>\"<i>Revan was power. It was like staring into the heart of the Force. Even then, you could see the Jedi he would slay etched on his soul.</i>\"<br />âSith Lord Darth Traya</p></blockquote><p>Revan was the most powerful Jedi of his era. During the Mandalorian Wars, Revan was considered the Jedi Order's greatest champion. After becoming a Sith Lord, Revan's command of the Force grew as he studied the ancient practices of the dark side. Following his redemption, Revan was stronger than ever before, now having a unique understanding of the Force. His mastery allowed himself to open up to both sides of the Force simultaneously, summoning such power that he could then unleash the Force in its purest form. Even after three centuries of imprisonment and torture, Revan's dominance over his contemporaries continued, only ever being truly surpassed by the Sith Emperor Vitiate.</p><p>Revan was a master of telekinesis, utilizing the Force to manipulate the environment and thrash around enemies. On Dromund Kaas, Revan crumbled a stone archway and blew open the large doors to the Sith Emperor's throne room with simple gestures. He then used his power to hurl Vitiate onto the ground. During the battle of the Foundry, Revan called down nearby meteors, pulling them into the Inner Sanctum. Later, on Yavin IV, Revan was capable of wielding two additional lightsabers with the Force, sending them spinning around the battlefield. He also telekinetically incapacitated almost a dozen separate combatants at once, which included Darth Marr, Satele Shan, and Lana Beniko.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5115338-2775688010-13029.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5115338\" data-ratio=\"1.1152416356877\" data-width=\"538\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 538px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.5%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5115338-2775688010-13029.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5115338\"><img alt=\"Revan unleashing his power.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" data-width=\"573\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5115338-2775688010-13029.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5115338-2775688010-13029.jpg 538w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Revan unleashing his power.\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5115338-2775688010-13029.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5115338-2775688010-13029.jpg 538w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" data-width=\"573\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Revan unleashing his power.</figcaption></figure><p>He's also skilled in defensive applications of telekiensis, being capable of forming protective Force bubbles around himself on the Foundry and Yavin IV. In his battle against Vitiate, Revan managed to recover from Vitiate's telekinetic attack that sent him flying across the throne room. With tutaminis, Revan even proved capable of absorbing the dark power of Darth Nyriss, sparing Meetra Surik and Scourge from certain incineration. However, he was incapable of fully defending himself against the fully unleashed lightning of Emperor Vitiate, who scorched Revan with severe burns. Nevertheless, Revan still survived the deadly assault, and quickly thereafter healed his injuries with the Force.</p><p>Many years earlier, Revan overcame the corruptive and draining dark side energies of the Star Forge - a feat that required considerable willpower and Force capabilities. Revan also proved capable of resisting the benevolent influence of Malachor V, the dark energies of Korriban, and the absolute nothingness of Nathema. During his three-centuries of imprisonment and torture, Revan partially shielded his mind from the combined and continuous efforts of the Sith Emperor and the Dread Masters. After his defeat on the Foundry, his darker half willed himself back from the dead to continue his work, presumably holding his body together through the power of the Force, while his lighter half became one with the Force.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118777-revan+prodigal.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5118777\" data-ratio=\"1.36\" data-width=\"225\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 225px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.0%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118777-revan+prodigal.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5118777\"><img alt=\"\"The Prodigal Knight.\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118777-revan+prodigal.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140132/5118777-revan+prodigal.png 225w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"The Prodigal Knight.\"</figcaption></figure><p>Along with established Force defenses and willpower, Revan had great pain tolerance. His resistance to torment made Saul Karath believe that torturing him would be pointless and surprised the former Sith headmaster Jorak Uln. When in prison, Revan used the Force to block out the pain and drugs induced by Scourge, pushing physical human capabilities to the limit. Following his freedom, first death, and resurrection, Revan was capable of enduring a wealth of combat injuries without faltering. Even after being bested by two coalition forces, Revan managed to rise again, ready to continue battle. Thousands of years later, his drug-resisting techniques would be learned and applied by Darth Bane.</p><p>Malachor V and Korriban contained a treasure-trove of Sith artifacts and techniques that Revan studied during the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil Wars. Revan learned to use the Force to slow the minds and bodies of his targets, and replenish his energies by feeding on them. His mastery of Force drain was passed on to his Order's Sith Assassins, and eventually Darth Bane. Revan also learned how to unleash storms of Force lightning, conceal his darkness from the Jedi, drain knowledge from the minds of the Rakata, and personally developed the infamous thought bomb. Later, he showed the rare ability to teleport, using it to escape the Foundry and navigate around the battlefield of Yavin IV.</p><p>Revan had finely attuned senses, frequently experiencing accurate Force visions and being capable of reaching across the entire galaxy to communicate or probe others - a technique he also taught the Sith Assassins. Using such power, Revan called to the Revanite leader Tari Darkspanner from across the galaxy to seek him out. Using telepathy, Revan also learned how to corrupt Jedi to his cause, influencing and breaking their minds with the Force. Revan's skills in the practice were such that he was able to subtly influence the Sith Emperor to postpone the Great Galactic War for three-centuries as he learned about the Sith war effort, and then later persuaded him to sign the Treaty of Coruscant.</p><h3>Other Abilities</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"Revan was one of the greatest military leaders in the galaxy - in history.

Revan's skill as a battlefield commander earned him the undying respect of both the Mandalorian and Echani warrior cultures; the Mandalorians saw him as a supremely worthy foe - one that both embodied their philosophies and showed them their weaknesses. The Echani, on the other hand, believed that Revan represented the epitome of what one could achieve in the arts of war, and that much of his skill was born out of a highly advanced battle precognition.</p><p>During the Jedi Civil Wars, Revan won battle after battle against the Jedi. If not for Darth Malak's betrayal, he would have soon controlled the entire galaxy. Three-centuries later, Revan expanded the small Dromund Kaas-based Order of Revan cult into a galactic-stretching organization with thousands of members. The Revanites were such a threat that the Sith Empire and Jedi Order initiated a temporary cease-fire and coalition in order to bring down Revan. Above Rishi, Revan orchestrated a lot that nearly resulted in the destruction of Darth Marr and Satele Shan's primary fleet, but was foiled by the efforts of the galaxy's finest. He was later pushed back and defeated on Yavin IV.</p><p>Revan spoke and comprehended a variety of languages beyond his native Basic: Mando'a, Binary, Huttese, Shyriiwook, Selkath and that of the ancient Sith. Revan was also a skilled mechanic, exhibiting a natural talent and interest in machinery and droids. Revan constructed the sophisticated assassin droid <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/hk-47/3005-828/\">HK-47</a> on his own after the Mandalorian Wars, and even after losing his memories, he was able to repair the droid and restore HK-47's access to most of his memories and combat protocols. Revan also proved adept at racing swoop bikes after defeating the veteran racer Redros on Taris. He later won both the Arkanis sector and Manaan swoop championships as well during the Jedi Civil Wars.</p><h3>Battlefield Equipment</h3><blockquote><p>\"<i>Revan wore the mask during the Mandalorian Wars, and during his time as Darth Revan. To me, it symbolizes his dark past - a relic from a time before he became the man I loved. I was afraid that if I showed it to him, it might trigger something inside his mind.

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Asajj Ventress is a Dark Jedi from the planet Rattak, and one of <a href=\"/count-dooku/4005-5392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5392\">Count Dooku's</a> <a href=\"/the-force/4015-50253/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\">Force</a>-attuned apprentices. She is a powerful warrior with exceptional combat abilities, and desires most of all to join the <a href=\"/the-sith/4060-44460/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44460\">Sith</a> order. She has many distinctive Sith tattoos and wields twin red <a href=\"/lightsaber/4055-44097/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\">lightsabers</a>. She was under the tutelage of Ky Narec, however when Ky Narec was slain, she joined the dark side because she believed the <a href=\"/jedi/4015-52199/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\">Jedi</a> abandoned Narec, and took up the ways of the Sith.</p><p>Each twelve marks on her head represent the twelve warlords she killed for revenge. She then became the dictator for Rattatak. (which the twelve warlords use to rule.) She was then discovered by Dooku in a gladiator arena. She was the last standing and he found her strong in the Dark Side of the Force. Later, she went with Durge to Ohama-D'un where she wiped out a Gungan colony with a swamp gas. They both knew Jedi would come, and when <a href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\">Obi-Wan</a> came, they ambushed his team.</p><p>She finished off Glaive and <a href=\"/zule-xiss/4005-59520/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59520\">Zule Xiss</a> and almost killed Obi-Wan. Kenobi was saved by <a href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\">Skywalker</a> and Alpha-17. Three months since the Battle of Geonosis, a plot was made between Asajj and the new member of the Separatists, the Jedi <a href=\"/sora-bulq/4005-51781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51781\">Sora Bulq</a>. The plot was to eliminate some Jedi including <a href=\"/mace-windu/4005-5395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\">Mace Windu</a>. In a mock ambush, Asajj wounded Sora and killed Mira. The plot was going good until Mace Windu discovered the truth that Sora betrayed the Jedi Order. Mace Windu finished the duel with a Force Push into a rocky wall.</p><p>Before he could finish him off he sensed that his Jedi friends was in trouble and had to leave that very moment. Asajj almost killed K'kruhk and <a href=\"/sian-jeisel/4005-57930/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57930\">Sian Jeisel</a> when Mace jumped on her back. After a few moments of lightsabers clashing, Asajj escaped in a solor sailor. Kenobi went after Ventress to save the lives of a few Jedi by getting the antidote from her. Asajj captured him but was forbidden to kill him as Dooku instructed. Obi-Wan escaped along with the antidote.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2969921\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132327/2969921-the-jedi-confront-ventress.png\" data-ratio=\"0.80111111111111\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132327/2969921-the-jedi-confront-ventress.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2969921\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132327/2969921-the-jedi-confront-ventress.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132327/2969921-the-jedi-confront-ventress.png 900w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132327/2969921-the-jedi-confront-ventress.png 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132327/2969921-the-jedi-confront-ventress.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Asajj Ventress's home planet is Dathomir, later seen in The Courtship of Princess Leia. In the Clone War era, Ventress returns there to the Nightsisters where it was told she came from there but was taken at an early age. She seeks a male Zabrak to train and to be used as a spy against Count Dooku her now former Master. Savage Opress is empowered by Sith sorcery and later taught a crude usage of the Force by Count Dooku. She then attempts to defeat Dooku with Savage, but once again ends up betrayed this time by her agent.</p><p>Later, Dooku seeks vengeance on Ventress, Mother Talzin and the Nightsisters by sending General Grevious and the Confedarate troops to Dathomir. Ventress holds her own against Grevious, but the driod army overpowers and massacre the Nightsisters, with the exception of Ventress and Mother Talzin. Once again on her own, Ventress decided to resort to the life of a bounty hunter. Her exploits included teaming up with a young Boba Fett, saving Obi-Wan against Savage and his brother Darth Maul, and helping former Jedi Ashoka Tano.</p><p>One storyline told in the earlier Clone Wars comic series was the Obsession 4 part miniseries. This showed Obi-Wan Kenobi obsessed with hunting down and capturing Ventress. As Kenobi continued, it was Anakin Skywalker who played the role of mediator concerned that his Master was slipping close to the Dark Side with his fixation over Ventress. On Boz Pity, Ventress, wounded was attacked by both Kenobi and Skywalker. Once defeated and believed to be dying she was sent to Coruscant, however she was in a Jedi trance and directed the pilot to send her from the Jedis, Dooku and the war. Her whereabouts were unknown after this.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>None knows Azrael origin, not even Azrael himself. The only thing that is known about his origin is that Azrael is an alien being whose spaceship crash-landed sometime in the past over Mount Michelson in Alaska. His ship buryed itself in the frigid Alaskan ice, and it lay undiscovered for an undetermined period of time until scientists from S.T.A.R. labs discovered it, and the cryogenically frozen body of the winged alien being which lay within.</p><p>Using the research of the late scientist Elinore Stone, S.T.A.R. scientists successfully brought the spaceman out of his frozen state and into a world in which he didn't belong. Azrael possesses no memory of his former life, his planet of origin, his mission in space, or his true name. He was revived and soon met the New Teen Titans and Lilith, falling hopelessly in love with her. Lilith reciprocated those feelings only somewhat.</p><p>The Winged Man was tricked by the Church of Blood into thinking that he was Azrael, the angel of Death. Blood's Church eventually fell, and Azrael learned he was duped. It was he who dropped the broken-spirited Brother Blood off at a monastery when the villain's mind was broken by Raven. Azrael vowed to watch over Brother Blood, even in his broken state.</p><p>Azrael later aided the Titans again during the Technis Imperative conflict but has not been seen since that time.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Ariel alien body has natural birdlike wings on his back which allow him flight. He has enhanced agility and utilizes this while in flight.</p>",

    "deck": "Loren Jupiter was the Teen Titan's financer and funder. He is also the father of Titan member, Omen.",
    "description": "<a href=\"/\"> </a><h2>History<br /></h2>Loren Jupiter is a millonaire that through the ages has used his money and intellect to become a man with a lot of influence, he had a son and a daughter however he didn't know any of them until they had reached adulthood. Years later Loren Jupiter would start a government sponsored program whose objective would be to train the teenagers of the United States in order to prepare them to be better adults, a program that would one day convince most of the original <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19081\" href=\"/teen-titans/4060-19081/\">               Teen Titans</a> to join the program, the one member that didn't join was their leader <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\" href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\">              Robin</a> (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\" href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\">             Dick Grayson</a>) as he decided to go to college.<br /><br /><h3>Teen Titans funder...again</h3>Various years after the disbanding of the original team of Teen Titans, Loren Jupiter along with his assistant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12525\" href=\"/lilith-clay/4005-12525/\">            Omen</a> (Lilith Clay) would appear once more in order to fund a new generation of Teen Titans that was formed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13016\" href=\"/prysm/4005-13016/\">                     Prysm</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46408\" href=\"/fringe/4005-46408/\">                    Fringe</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13096\" href=\"/hot-spot/4005-13096/\">                   Joto</a> (Hotspot), <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13015\" href=\"/risk/4005-13015/\">                  Risk</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3575\" href=\"/argent/4005-3575/\">                 Argent</a> and was leaded by a de-aged version of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-34685\" href=\"/atom-palmer/4005-34685/\">                Ray Palmer</a> (The Atom). This team would have several different missions, the one that is more important to mention for Loren Jupiter is when the Teen Titans along with the former founding members (Nightwing, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3404\" href=\"/roy-harper/4005-3404/\">           Arsenal</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4913\" href=\"/donna-troy/4005-4913/\">          Donna Troy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\" href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\">         Flash</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2382\" href=\"/tempest/4005-2382/\">        Tempest</a>) battled and fought <a data-ref-id=\"4005-76366\" href=\"/haze/4005-76366/\">       Haze</a> who revealed to be Jarrod Jupiter, the long lost son of Mr. Jupiter.<br /><br />Together, the two Teen Titans teams were able to defeat the menace of Haze, it was also at the end of this mission that it was revealed that Omen was the former member of the Teen Titans known as Lilith Clay and that she was in fact, Loren Jupiter's ilegitimate daughter. Loren Jupiter would continue to fund the Teen Titans until the team disbanded yet again, after that he would move to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\" href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\">      Metropolis</a> and not be seen after that.<br /><br /><h3>Infinite Crisis?</h3>The writer of the series \"<a data-ref-id=\"4045-40799\" href=\"/the-omac-project/4045-40799/\"> <i>The OMAC Project</i></a>\" Greg Rucka revealed in an interview that originally it was Loren Jupiter who was going to be the guy in charge of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40521\" href=\"/checkmate/4060-40521/\">     Checkmate</a> and the guy behind the O.M.A.C. project and the guy responsible for killing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2054\" href=\"/blue-beetle-kord/4005-2054/\">   Blue Beetle</a> (Ted Kord), however as the story progressed he realized that an evil <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10149\" href=\"/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/\">  Maxwell Lord</a> fit better in the storyline because of his telepathic powers and his connection to the members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-26208\" href=\"/justice-league-international/4060-26208/\"> Justice League International</a>, replacing Loren Jupiter from doing his first appearance since the disbanding of his Teen Titans team.<br /><br /><h2>Possible powers</h2><p>Though no powers have been displayed by Loren Jupiter in any of his appearances, the fact that he has had 2 different children with different mothers and both had psychic powers it is believed that Loren Jupiter has the same powers and that he inherited them to his daughter and son, however there is nothing to confirm or deny this information.<br /></p>",

This character was abruptly canceled after his appearance in Marvel Mystery Comics #3. Some say the reason for this was because American Ace was too politically intense for children, no one however knows for sure if this is true or not. </p><p> </p><p>The character makes one more Golden-Age appearance in pages of The Arrow, a comic published by Centaur Comics, while the story and lead character are the same with the story continuing where it had left off in Marvel Mystery Comics # 2, with him being an air ace involved between two warring European countries, Attania and Castile d'Or, and while drawn the same as American Ace, his name is changed to Lieutenant Lank.</p>",

    "deck": "Shaak Ti is a Togruta Jedi Master who proved herself integral to the Republic efforts in the Clone Wars. Described by Mace Windu as \"beautiful as a flower, yet as deadly as a viper,\" Ti demonstrated wisdom and clarity in battle alongside deadly skill with a lightsaber. She was one of the few Jedi to survive Order 66 but was later hunted down and killed by Darth Vader's secret apprentice, Galen Marek.",
    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shaak Ti was a prominent member of the <a href=\"/the-jedi-high-council/4060-45051/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45051\">Jedi Council </a>throughout the Clone wars. Known for her excellence in <a href=\"/lightsaber/4055-44097/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\">lightsaber </a>combat, she proved herself a valuable Jedi General to the republic. Her feats in the Clone Wars include protecting the growing army of clone troopers in the First Battle of <a href=\"/kamino/4020-55722/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55722\">Kamino</a>, surviving a fight with <a href=\"/general-grievous/4005-44582/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44582\">General Grievous </a>during the Battle of Hypori, and narrowly surviving Order 66 during <a href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\">Darth Vader</a>'s Attack on the <a href=\"/jedi-temple/4020-56425/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56425\">Jedi Temple</a>. After Order 66, Shaak Ti traveled across the galaxy before finding her place on Felucia. She took in an orphan named <a href=\"/maris-brood/4005-49603/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49603\">Maris Brood </a>and raised her in the ways of the force, wary to save her from the dark side. On Felucia she trained until Vader's secret apprentice, <a href=\"/secret-apprentice/4005-49602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49602\">Starkiller</a>, was sent after her. After a defeat at the hands of Starkiller, Shaak Ti flung herself into the Felucian Ancient Abyss.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3>Early career</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a newly appointed Jedi Knight, Shaak Ti took two Padawan learners under her training. She trained her students back on her homeland. Unfortunately, both students were killed shortly after Shaak finished training them. Shaak Ti's Jedi training allowed her to cope with the death of her padawan, Fe Sun, at the hands of the career criminal <a href=\"/lyshaa/4005-64509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64509\">Lyshaa</a>. Shortly after this tragedy, Shaak Ti, assisted by Jedi Master <a href=\"/coleman-trebor/4005-51673/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51673\">Trebor </a>saved <a href=\"/emperor-palpatine/4005-16164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16164\">Chancellor Palpatine</a>'s life from an assassination attempt.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3>Clone Wars</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shaak Ti was part of the Jedi Platoon that rescued <a href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\">Obi-wan </a>at the beginning of the Battle of <a href=\"/geonosis/4020-56447/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56447\">Geonosis</a>. She survived the battle, taken away in a rescue ship that <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/yoda/4005-5396/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5396\">Yoda</a>brought. After the battle, Shaak Ti was appointed as a jedi General of the Clone army of the republic, for the remainder of the Jedi involvement in the Clone wars. Shaak Ti was recognized along with <a href=\"/mace-windu/4005-5395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\">Mace Windu </a>and <a href=\"/plo-koon/4005-5403/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5403\">Plo Koon </a>for her part in a successful mission on Ando, by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. She was awarded a grove of Ch'hala trees which she then donated to the Jedi Temple. <a href=\"/count-dooku/4005-5392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5392\">Dooku</a>'s apprentice, <a href=\"/asajj-ventress/4005-46932/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46932\">Asajj Ventress </a>placed a bounty on Shaak Ti's head, as well as 81 other jedi, throughout the Clone wars.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3>First Battle of Kamino</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shaak Ti was one of the Jedi sent to Kamino after learning of the <a href=\"/confederacy-of-independant-systems/4060-51712/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51712\">Confederacy</a>'s plans to attack the Republic's cloning facilities there. Shaak Ti worked on setting up the planet's defenses alongside Lama Su. Master Ti assissted the other jedi in preserving the life of the growing clones on Kamino, and driving the separatist attackers away from the planet, winning the Battle for the Republic.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3>Battle of Hypori</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As part of a jedi task force, Shaak Ti was sent to Hypori to destroy a large droid factory supplying the Separatist armies. The task force consisted of Jedi Masters: <a href=\"/ki-adi-mundi/4005-5422/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5422\">Ki Adi Mundi</a>, <a href=\"/aayla-secura/4005-5389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5389\">Aayla Secura</a>, K'Krunk, Barrek, and Tarr Seyirr, as well as an army of clone troopers. As soon as the task force's ships came out of hyperspace, their ships were brought down by orbital mines putting the task force behind enemy lines, completely surrounded by the droid army created by the very factory they were sent to destroy. The clone army was wiped out and the seven jedi were left to fend for themselves. Surrounded, the jedi backed themselves into the wreckage of their ship when Grievous approached them out of the droid army. Amongst the wreckage, General Grievous engaged the seven jedi. In the beginning of the battle, Grievous killed K'Krunk, Barrek, and Seyirr, before critically wounding Secura. Ki Adi Mundi and Shaak Ti then managed to hold their own against Grevious until rescued by Republic ARC troopers. Only Mundi, Secura, and Ti made it out alive</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3>Battle of Brentaal IV</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the Republic learned that a separatist stronghold on <a href=\"/brentaal-iv/4020-56453/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56453\">Brentaal IV </a>would be out of commission for a few weeks, they saw an opportunity to secure an important trade planet for the Republic. Shaak Ti was part of a four jedi task force aided by a platoon of clone troopers and a number of air/land vehicles. With Jedi Master Plo Koon commanding the assault from orbit, Shaak Ti led the ground forces in their attack on the fortress. As Shaak Ti and a few clones entered the fortress through its sewers, she noticed that the fortress was, in fact, a separatist prison. The battle outside had created the distraction needed to fuel a jail break on the inside. Master Shaak Ti offered the prisoners freedom if they would assist her in demolishing the fortress. Notable among the prisoners were Jedi Knight <a href=\"/quinlan-vos/4005-5387/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5387\">Quinlan Vos </a>- a friend of Shaak Ti and long thought dead by the Jedi Council - And Lyshaa, the criminal who murdered Shaak Ti's Padawan.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Master Vos left to attack the shield generators leaving Master Shaak Ti and Lyshaa with the responsibility of finding and defeating the Warden of the facility, Warlord Shogar Tok. Despite many attempts by Lyshaa to solicit an attack from Shaak Ti, Master Ti refrained from any hostility. The two proceeded toward Shogar Tok's chambers when Lyshaa turned on Shaak Ti and the pair were suddenly caught in a trap of Tok's that Lyshaa unknowingly sprung. Shaak Ti saved both herself and Lyshaa and the two continued toward Tok's chambers. When they finally reached Tok, Lyshaa turned on Shaak Ti again and shot her in the stomach in an attempt to get on Tok's good side. Shaak Ti used the force to give herself the appearance of being dead while she healed herself, and, when ready, attacked Shogar Tok and Lyshaa. Shaak Ti killed Shogar and offered to spare Lyshaa. However, Lyshaa didn't trust Ti and fled, only to be caught in another trap of Shogar's, this time fatal. With the mission a success, Master Ti was extracted and placed in a Bacta tank to fully heal from her injuries.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3>Battle of Dagu</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Later in the war, Master Shaak Ti and a large complement of clones were taken prison and kept on the planet, Dagu. The prison at which they were kept was run by one of Count Dooku's most skilled Dark Jedi, Artel Darc. Shaak Ti led a prison revolt along with her attachment of clones to free the prisoners and defeat the confederate forces on Dagu. In the end, Shaak Ti struck down Darc, and was rewarded with a medal by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine for her victory.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Galen Marek's List</strong></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shaak Ti was put on Galen Marek (AKA Starkiller's) hitlist for jedi needed to be killed who survived order 66, Shaak Ti was confronted by, and met her unfortunate death in battle with Starkiller at the mouth of a Sarlacc she was defending from being killed by the Empire.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Biography</h2><p>Luminara Unduli was born on the planet Mirial, a cold, dry, and despondent world oppressed by the Trade Federation. She was taken into the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41234\" href=\"/jedi-order/4060-41234/\">Jedi Order</a> at a young age, and so lived through little of the misery known to most <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57990\" href=\"/mirialans/4060-57990/\">Mirialans</a>.</p><p>As a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\" href=\"/jedi/4015-52199/\">Jedi</a>, she dedicated herself to physical disciplines; her patterned tattoos were a traditional Mirialan reflection of this somatic commitment. She trained heavily to improve her corporal prowess, working over the course of years to enhance her flexibility and agility in combat.</p><p>She became a Master in the years prior to the Invasion of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56385\" href=\"/naboo/4020-56385/\">Naboo</a>. Honoring the cultural traditions of her native people, which required that any Mirialan child given to the Jedi Order be trained by Mirialan masters, she took only Mirialans as apprentices. She was a close friend to fellow Masters <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46940\" href=\"/shaak-ti/4005-46940/\">Shaak Ti</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5387\" href=\"/quinlan-vos/4005-5387/\">Quinlan Vos</a>.</p><p>A raveled web of alliances conspired to elevate a small and unimportant world in the Mid Rim, Ansion, to a position of profound strategic significance as the Separatist Crisis threatened to split the Galactic Republic. Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, the Jedi Council dispatched <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46941\" href=\"/luminara-unduli/4005-46941/\">Luminara</a> and her Padawan, Barriss Office, to the previously galactically insignificant world, where they were met by Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\" href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> and his apprentice, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\" href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\">Anakin Skywalker</a>. The four Jedi were charged with forestalling any incipient local separatist movement.</p><p>Their mission was made difficult by the cultural division which gripped Ansion: one part of the planet's population dwelt in cities and towns and engaged in trade with other worlds in the Republic; the other part lived in a loose confederation of nomadic clans on Ansion's vast, windy plains. The two factions were bitterly mistrustful of one another, and had been in conflict for more than a thousand years.</p><p>Luminara and her Padawan were ambushed not long after they arrived in the modest Ansionian capital, Cuipernam, by employees of Soergg the Hutt, a local crime lord whose services had been retained by the separatists. Cornered against a wall, Luminara sustained a minor blaster graze before Obi-Wan and Anakin arrived and defeated her attackers, who had expected only two Jedi.</p><p>Secure in their persons for the time being, Luminara and the other Jedi proceeded to the Ansionian council building, where they conducted initial negotiations with the Unity of Community Council, which represented the city-dwelling Ansionians. Like Ansion, the council was deeply divided. Roughly half its membership favored the Separatists, having been promised a quick and forceful end to the conflict with the prairie-dwelling Alwari nomads by the Separatist leadership and an escape from Republic taxes and regulations.</p><p>After a particularly unorthodox demonstration of the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\" href=\"/the-force/4015-50253/\">Force</a> on the Armalat delegate Tolut, and a promise of a very favorable settlement with the Alwari, Luminara was able to persuade the Council to provisionally agree to remain in the Republicâso long as the Jedi delivered on her promise.</p><p>The quartet's new focus was interrupted when Barriss was captured by two mentally disabled Ansionian gangsters in the employ of Soergg, Bulgan and Kyakhta. The young Padawan was able to convince her captors to help her escape Soergg's men by offering to heal them of their injuries. Restored to their former selves, the pair quickly aided Barriss in eluding the Hutt's clutches. Unsurprisingly, Luminara located her escaped Padawan before Obi-Wan or Anakin sensed her presence.</p><p>Bulgan and Kyakhta, grateful to and in awe of Barrissâand sensing an opportunityâappointed themselves guides to the four Jedi. Luminara and her colleagues accepted the aid of the Ansonian pair, not least because the two were both outcast members of Alwari clans.</p><p>In short order, the Jedi set out on an expedition to locate the scattered Alwari clans, particularly the Borokii overclan. Luminara, Barriss, their two colleagues and their guides, crossed out of Cuipernam into Ansion's vast prairie, riding on magnificent suubztar animals recommended by Bulgan and Kyakhta as much for their prestige among the Alwari as for the very practical advantages of the beasts.</p><p>As the expedition progressed, Luminara noticed a clear tension between Barriss and the confident Anakin, and discussed the brash Padawan's unusual case with Obi-Wan. On the way, they had to fend off attacks by gairk at a river crossing, and seek shelter from a large flock of suicidal kyren. At the camp of the first Alwari clan they encountered, the Yiwa, Luminara and the others were welcomed, but were required to provide entertainment that evening. After gaining a deeper understanding of the Alwari sense of tradition, Luminara contrived an entertainment that would satisfy the Yiwa. Taking a handful of sand from the ground, she let it fall through her fingers, but <i>against</i> the wind. Turning the stream of sand into a coil with expert manipulation of the Force, Luminara lifted twirling columns of sand around her in glittering spirals. Then she also began to twirl herself, until she was rapidly whirling around with spirals of sand forming a vortex around her as she rose off of her feet into the air. Climatically, the sand was formed into a globe around her as she spun in mid-air. Her dizzying performance completed, she returned to her place among the other Jedi amid the Alwari equivalent of applause. Even her companions were impressed by this feat.</p><p>Luminara again had cause to worry about Barriss when the Padawan disappeared chasing a Gwurran thief Tooqui. However, the Padawan was found, this time surrounded by rambunctious, inquisitive Gwurrans. Tooqui insisted on coming along with them, and Luminara reluctantly agreed, passing off responsibility for him to Barriss. The Gwurran would prove his worth when he rescued all four Jedi and the two Alwari after the Qulun clan used a scented perfume to send the Jedi to sleep and capture them in order to receive a payment from Soergg. After they escaped with their mounts, Luminara would later save Anakin's life when he was attacked by two predatory shanhs.</p><p>After being led to the Borokii clan, the Jedi were required to retrieve a tuft of wool from the exceedingly rare albino surepp herd animals without modern technology. Luminara went into the herd at night, bouncing off the top of each animal and retrieved the wool. On the way back, she slipped and was knocked unconscious. The other Jedi brought her out of the herd and the negotiations proceeded. The Borokii agreed to the settlement, but the Jedi were required to deal with their traditional enemies, the Januul clan. Under the leadership of Obi-Wan, the Jedi agreed, although Luminara was flabbergasted. When the two clans drew up to engage each other, the Jedi went in between of them and declared their intention to not fight <i>either</i> side. Luminara and the other Jedi then fended off attacks launched against them by both sides, but they parried only weapons, injuring and killing none of the combatants. Stunned, both clans agreed to the Jedi's proposition.</p><p>Returning to Cuipernam to inform the Unity Council, Soergg again tried to ambush the Jedi, who were then aided by an honor guard of both Januul and Borokii clans. Luminara then proceeded to the negotiations, where Ansionâa vital hub of alliancesâagreed to stay in the Republic. Her hard work, research, ingenuity and skill had helped keep a vital world in the Republic.</p><p>Shortly after Luminara and Barris returned from the mission to Ansion, it became apparent that a full-fledged military conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems would occur. Obi-Wan Kenobi was captured by the Confederacy on Geonosis, and Luminara and her Padawan joined Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\" href=\"/mace-windu/4005-5395/\">Mace Windu</a>'s quickly launched rescue mission.</p><p>Luminara and Mace were the vanguard for the approaching Jedi. The pair slipped past the planet's significant anti-orbital defenses and commandeered newly landed TX-130S fighter tanks which they used to destroy Geonosian gun emplacements blocking the way to the arena. When Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Senator <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6343\" href=\"/padme-amidala/4005-6343/\">Padme Amidala</a> were brought to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56447\" href=\"/geonosis/4020-56447/\">Geonosis</a> arena, Luminara, Barriss, and 212 other Jedi revealed themselves to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5392\" href=\"/count-dooku/4005-5392/\">Count Dooku</a>, the leader of the Confederacy, who was personally overseeing the planned execution. A heated but short battle followed; 179 Jedi Knights fell in battle before Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5396\" href=\"/yoda/4005-5396/\">Yoda</a> arrived with the newly-created clone army in several LAAT gunships to rescue the thirty-three Jedi who remained. The stadium was littered with droid parts. Luminara and her Padawan survived; they and the other surviving Jedi joined the battle as military commanders.</p><p>Luminara served as a Senior Jedi General in the Gran Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Units under her command included the 41st Elite Corps and a Republic naval task force. During the war, Unduli commanded a Republic task force during an engagement with a Separatist fleet near the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center that had arrived to assist the Confederate warship Malevolence, which was under attack by Republic forces.</p><p>Four months after the Battle of Geonosis, Luminara led her Padawan to the secret Jedi temple on the icy world Ilum, where the two traveled to complete Barriss's final <a data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\" href=\"/lightsaber/4055-44097/\">lightsaber</a> construction ceremony as a Padawan. Moments after the observance was completed, the two were attacked by invisible Separatist chameleon droids, which had infiltrated the temple in an attempt to destroy the cavern's precious natural lightsaber crystals.</p><p>Together, they were able to halt the droid assault, but much of the temple was brought down upon itself by mines the droids had set before attacking. Luminara and Barriss plunged into the depths of the temple cavern as great slices of rock and small and precious crystals alike plummeted to the ceremonial floor.</p><p>For moments, they were able to elude the stone maelstrom, but even their great powers working in concert were soon not enough to allow escape. The Jedi were trapped. Barriss reached out bodily with the force to halt the falling debris above her, and succeeded, only to glance at her Master, who sat in meditative harmony with the Force and falling stone. The apprentice joined the master in reflective poise, and, together, they calmly held up the crushing vault of stone which piled above them. Eventually, the pair were extricated by the efforts of Master Yoda, who had sensed their battle at a great distance while traveling through space.</p><p>With Offee overseeing an operation on Geonosis, Unduli traveled to Rodia to escort captured Trade Federation Viceroy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5409\" href=\"/nute-gunray/4005-5409/\">Nute Gunray</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-48936\" href=\"/coruscant/4020-48936/\">Coruscant</a> for trial. The Jedi Master was joined by Anakin Skywalker's Padawan, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55028\" href=\"/ahsoka-tano/4005-55028/\">Ahsoka Tano</a>. Aboard the Venator-class Star Destroyer Tranquility, Unduli spearheaded the interrogations of the viceroy, whose denial of information cost Tano her patience. The Padawan threatened Gunray with her lightsaber, and though Unduli scolded the Padawan for using fear as a weapon, the viceroy agreed to \"negotiate.\" Before any information could be gleaned, the Tranquility was attacked by Dark Acolyte <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46932\" href=\"/asajj-ventress/4005-46932/\">Asajj Ventress</a> and a battle droid squad, who had arrived to rescue Gunray.</p><p>After Luminara and Clone Commander CC-1004, nicknamed \"Gree,\" managed to destroy the army of B2 super battle droids, the Jedi Master sensed that Tano was in danger and rushed to meet with her. Unduli arrived to assist the Padawan in confronting Ventress, who was cornered. However, while \"surrendering,\" Ventress activated thermal detonators that she had planted in the Star Destroyer's engine room, crippling the cruiser, and escaped to the ravaged engine room. Although Tano offered to help, noting her past run-ins with Ventress and stating that the assassin was \"too powerful with any one Jedi,\" Unduli unwisely pursued the assassin on her own, leaving Tano to guard Gunray.</p><p>Finding and engaging Ventress in a lightaber duel, Unduli was hampered by a wound to the left eye early in the battle and was eventually trapped beneath several pipes the Dark Acolyte collapsed on her from the ceiling. As Ventress moved to deal the killing blow, the Jedi Master was saved by the timely arrival of Tano, who had decided to disobey her orders in the interest of helping Unduli. The Mirialan accepted the Padawan's help for the continuing duel, but in the end, Ventress escaped with Senate Commando Captain Faro Argyus, who had defected to the Separatists and freed Gunray from Republic custody. Unduli and Tano transmitted the signal of the Consular-class cruiser that the Separatists had used to escape the Tranquility to Jedi Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6330\" href=\"/kit-fisto/4005-6330/\">Kit Fisto</a>, who tracked Gunray to the third moon of Vassek. Unduli apologized to Tano for not taking her advice before the Padawan departed to rendezvous with her own Master.</p><p>Luminara was later sent to Geonosis to help Masters <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5422\" href=\"/ki-adi-mundi/4005-5422/\">Ki-Adi-Mundi</a> and Obi-Wan Kenobi destroy Poggle the Lesser's new droid foundry there. Along with her Padawan, Barriss Offee, she joined Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano in the storming of the droid factory. Whilst she and Skywalker acted as diversions, the two Padawans Barriss and Ahsoka made their way through the vast underground catacombs to destroy the factory.</p><p>Following this, Unduli went in search of Poggle the Lesser, who had retreated into the catacombs of an ancient temple. While she and a trooper searched the temple, a sandstorm prohibited reinforcements from reaching their positions.While communicating with Masters Kenobi and Mundi via hologram, Unduli's clone trooper was killed by the undead hordes of the mysterious Hive Queen Karina the Great. Having been knocked unconscious and captured, the Jedi Master was taken before Karina. Jedi Kenobi and Skywalker came to her rescue; they were not far of when Luminara regained consciousness and wrestled her way out of the zombie's reach, realizing what they were up against,she contacted Kenobi and told him not to come after her but she was cut off as the zombies overwhelmed her. The Jedi disregarded her warnings and continued their search until they came upon Karina's abode where they found Luminara in an energy trap for her to be infested with brain worms. With Kenobi and Commander Cody delaying the zombies and the Queen, Skywalker freed Unduli and the two captured Poggle. Cody and his troops shot down the cave support, burying the Queen and taking Poggle prisoner.</p><p>Five months after the Battle of Geonosis, Luminara Unduli would fight against <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44582\" href=\"/general-grievous/4005-44582/\">General Grievous</a> on the pastoral Republic world Nadiem in the Outer Rim. She was tasked with evacuating a city under threat from General Grievous's approaching droid army, she dispatched a strike team under her padawans Barriss Offee's command to Threadneedle Canyon, a strategic choke point between the city and the Separatist column.</p><p>She had ordered her Padawan to attempt to set off explosives to block the droid army's path, but Barriss, mindful of Luminara's lessons in hiding in plain sight, decided to play dead as the droid army walked past, and then attack them from the rear.</p><p>Luminara's strike team set off their explosives while the droid army was crossing through the canyon, destroying the column entirely. General Grievous' remaining forces were eventually defeated, though Grevious himself escaped Luminara, her army and a blockading naval force commanded by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5404\" href=\"/saesee-tiin/4005-5404/\">Saesee Tiin</a>.</p><p>Soon after departing from Nadiem, Luminara and her Padawan at last parted ways. Barriss had grown much as a Jedi under her instruction, and had little still to learn from her. Following a similar mission on Drongar, Barriss ascended to the rank of Jedi Knight, and they saw little of each other for the remainder of the war.</p><p>Luminara was one of several Jedi generals dispatched to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56700\" href=\"/wookiees/4060-56700/\">Wookiee</a> homeworld of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-45962\" href=\"/kashyyyk/4020-45962/\">Kashyyyk</a> during the Outer Rim Seiges to defend the vital Republic member world from Separatist attack. The Confederacy of Independent Systems desired secret hyperspace routes recorded in the Wookiee archives that could possibly turn the war in its favor, and was threatening to overrun the planet.</p><p>Luminara commanded the first units of the Grand Army to land on the Wookiee homeworld, including the 41st Elite Corps, led by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47048\" href=\"/clone-commander-gree/4005-47048/\">Commander Gree</a>. She was quickly joined by units commanded by Quinlan Vos and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59238\" href=\"/clone-commander-faie/4005-59238/\">Commander Faie</a>.</p><p>Alongside sparse members of their respective clone army divisions, Luminara and Vos, as well as Wookiees led by an elder from the Palsaang tribe, Gumbaeki, infiltrated an encampment of Trandoshans, using the Separatist raiding party as an excuse to capture and enslave Wookiees. They easily and swiftly destroyed the encampment and freed the hairy simians, but an ambushing crab droid pinned down the small force until the Devaronian smuggler, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64128\" href=\"/vilmarh-grahrk/4005-64128/\">Vilmarh Grahrk</a>, a friend of Master Vos, and his young Wookiee friend, Gumbaeki's grandson, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56354\" href=\"/chak/4005-56354/\">Chak</a>, intervened by firing on the droid with their small ship's weapons.</p><p>By the time the primary droid assault was launched, Luminara and Vos had returned to the Republic command base at Kachirho, where they had been joined by Master Yoda. Luminara's 41st Elite and detachments of the 501st Legion, supported by Wookiees, were assigned to fight on the beachfront defending the sea wall and to hold the line until Separatist forces were fully committed. When the droid army committed in full, Yoda gave the word to Luminara to charge the left flank of the droid army. Simultaneously, Quinlan Vos, alongside Chewbacca and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-78163\" href=\"/tarfful/4005-78163/\">Tarfful</a>, was sent across the lagoon to lead an attack on approaching Separatist forces.</p><p>The battle seemed to go back and forth until, despite the best efforts of the combined Wookiee/Grand Army of the Republic defense, Kachirho became in danger of being overrun by the Separatists. The 501st Legion was beaten back by Separatist forces, which advanced on the Kachirho seawall in an attempt to destroy a crucial oil refinery.</p><p>The best efforts of Luminara's soldiers managed to keep the sea wall intact until General Yoda could arrive to push the Confederacy back. With the foiling of this crucial mission, the droid army began to retreat. Luminara turned to the healing of wounded clone troopers and Wookiees as the battle neared its end.</p><p>After the battle dwindled on Kashyyyk, Unduli was surrounded by her troops as she was initiating clean up procedures. While preparing to assist in the healing of the wounded, <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55868\" href=\"/order-66/4015-55868/\">Order 66</a> was transmitted to the clone troopers under her command. Unaware of her imminent danger, Unduli could not even draw her lightsaber before being shot in the chest by the troopers led by the clone Commander Faie. When the Galactic Empire emerged, official records compiled by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53770\" href=\"/emperor-pestage/4005-53770/\">Sate Pestage</a> stated that Luminara was executed because she was a conspirator in the plot to overthrow the Republic.</p><p>Eight months after the execution of Order 66, the Wookiee Chak created a memorial to the Jedi lost on Kashyyyk in one of the high caves. Her image stood above that of Quinlan Vos, and adjacent to Master Yoda's.</p>",

Vulture 2099 is apparently insane, a cannibal (he refers to those he eats as \"corpses\") he wishes to have complete control of the sky and is the leader of a gang known as \"The Freakers\".</p><p>When most of the civilized world is flooded, the Vulture creates a floating boat-colony off the shores of the Savage Land. His new crew is called the 'Wild Boys'. There, he recovers an old associate, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43161\" href=\"/wulff/4005-43161/\" slug=\"wulff\">Wulff</a>, whom his gang torments.</p>",

    "deck": "Sasha Martens and Wiley Wolverman come from opposite tracks.  They like different music, movies, sports, and food.  Yet... there is a chemistry, a spark, something undeniable.  Together they are Hawk & Dove.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Origin</h2><p>Sasha Martens grew up as a \"military brat\". Â Her father, Colonel Michael Martens of the U.S. Air Force, came from a long line of military men. Â When Sasha was a child, she almost died of leukemia but was cured with an experimental drug from the government.<br/></p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-46948\" href=\"/wiley-wolverman/4005-46948/\" slug=\"wiley-wolverman\">Wiley Wolverman</a> also had a strange disease when he was a kid and was cured through the same program. Â Wiley had an unconventional family life; his father Jesse was a nihilist and his mother Polly was a Broadway star.</p><p>When Sasha reached adulthood, she attended a concert of the band named the Doves. Â As a riot broke out, Sasha met a Dove, the band guitarist Wiley Wolverman, and the two departed. Â Sasha and Wiley learned they were both part of the same military experiment and searched for answers at a nearby military base. Â Sasha looked for records to Doctor Thurber Avian's \"Operation Raptor\". Â The two discovered that civilians were used in these experiments. Â Sasha and Wiley encountered a bird/man creature accessing the files, and soon the military police arrived and a scuffle ensued. Â Sasha and Wiley eluded the police and retreated to Wiley's apartment. Â Upon awakening, Sasha and Wiley sprouted wings, which they learned to mentally control manifesting or retracting them into their backs. Â They vowed to track down Dr. Avian as the government started to hunt them as fugitives.</p><p>Sasha and Wiley were captured by Dr. Avian while trying to locate him. Â Avian revealed the government used his research findings (although they declared him insane). Â Most experiments were failures, except Wiley and Sasha, because the godwave energies coincided with their development. Â Avian, now utterly insane, wanted to extract DNA samples from the duo to recreate his formula. Â Sasha and Wiley escaped as Avian's lab exploded. Â Vigilante (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-9952\" href=\"/patricia-trayce/4005-9952/\" slug=\"patricia-trayce\">Pat Trayce</a>) and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2551\" href=\"/vixen/4005-2551/\" slug=\"vixen\">Vixen</a> tracked down <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42865\" href=\"/hawk-dove/4060-42865/\" slug=\"hawk-dove\">Hawk &amp; Dove</a> at the behest of <span class=\"yui-non\"><a data-ref-id=\"4060-40521\" href=\"/checkmate/4060-40521/\" slug=\"checkmate\">Checkmate</a></span>, as unscrupulous Government Agent <span class=\"yui-non\">Freitag</span> dispatched the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40394\" href=\"/suicide-squad/4060-40394/\" slug=\"suicide-squad\">Suicide Squad</a> to hunt them.</p><p>The duo, with the help of Vigilante, Vixen, and Colonel Martens, repelled the Suicide Squad and found a temporary safe haven. Â As Suicide Squad assaulted the heroes, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4920\" href=\"/amanda-waller/4005-4920/\" slug=\"amanda-waller\">Amanda Waller</a> learned of Agent Freitag's duplicity: Freitag planned on using Hawk &amp; Dove as his own personal predators or kill them. Â Waller tried to stop him as he flew off in an exo-suit to retrieve the avian duo himself. Â Freitag very nearly defeated them until Sasha and Wiley were able to establish physical contact, giving them both a power boost able to rip apart Freitag's exo-suit. Â Meanwhile, Waller ordered the Suicide Squad to stand down and bring Freitag into custody. Â Waller offered Hawk &amp; Dove a position working for the government under her auspices. Â Sasha was willing, but Wiley declined working for \"The Man\". Â Wiley confessed his love for Sasha as he kissed her departed.</p><p>Apparently, Hawk &amp; Dove remained partners, as they both appeared in a membership drive for a Titans West Coast team.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Hawk &amp; Dove can manifest wings by mentally willing them to sprout from their backs. Â This enables them to fly. Â Hawk &amp; Dove also possess a sonic shriek ability. Â The duo also experience a boost in powers, increasing their strength, stamina and endurance, when they are in close proximity to each other. Â Sasha is an above-average fighter, having grown up as an \"military brat\" in the Air Force.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Wiley Wolverman had a strange disease when he was a kid and was curedÂ with an experimental drug from the government. Â Wiley had an unconventional family life; his father Jesse was a nihilist and his mother Polly was a Broadway star.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-46947\" href=\"/sasha-martens/4005-46947/\" slug=\"sasha-martens\">   Sasha Martens</a> grew up as a \"military brat\". Â Her father, Colonel Michael Martens of the U.S. Air Force, came from a long line of military men. Â When Sasha was a child, she almost died of leukemia but was cured with the same experimental drug from the government.</p><p>When Sasha reached adulthood, she attended a concert of the band named the Doves of which the band guitarist was Wiley Wolverman. Â Sasha and Wiley met and learned they were both part of the same military experiment and searched for answers at a nearby military base. Â Sasha looked for records to Doctor Thurber Avian's \"Operation Raptor\". Â The two discovered that civilians were used in these experiments. Â Sasha and Wiley encountered a bird/man creature accessing the files, and soon the military police arrived and a scuffle ensued. Â Sasha and Wiley eluded the police and retreated to Wiley's apartment. Â Upon awakening, Sasha and Wiley sprouted wings, which they learned to mentally control manifesting or retracting them into their backs. Â They vowed to track down Dr. Avian as the government started to hunt them as fugitives.<br/></p><p>Sasha and Wiley were captured by Dr. Avian while trying to locate him. Â Avian revealed the government used his research findings (although they declared him insane). Â Most experiments were failures, except Wiley and Sasha, because the godwave energies coincided with their development. Â Avian, now utterly insane, wanted to extract DNA samples from the duo to recreate his formula. Â Sasha and Wiley escaped as Avian's lab exploded. Â Vigilante (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-9952\" href=\"/patricia-trayce/4005-9952/\" slug=\"patricia-trayce\"> Pat Trayce</a>) and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2551\" href=\"/vixen/4005-2551/\" slug=\"vixen\"> Vixen</a>Â tracked down <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42865\" href=\"/hawk-dove/4060-42865/\" slug=\"hawk-dove\"> Hawk &amp; Dove</a>Â at the behest ofÂ  <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40521\" href=\"/checkmate/4060-40521/\" slug=\"checkmate\">   Checkmate</a>, as unscrupulous Government Agent Freitag dispatched the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40394\" href=\"/suicide-squad/4060-40394/\" slug=\"suicide-squad\"> Suicide Squad</a>Â to hunt them.</p><p>The duo, with the help of Vigilante, Vixen, and Colonel Martens, repelled the Suicide Squad and found a temporary safe haven. Â As Suicide Squad assaulted the heroes,Â <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4920\" href=\"/amanda-waller/4005-4920/\" slug=\"amanda-waller\">   Amanda Waller</a>Â learned of Agent Freitag's duplicity: Freitag planned on using Hawk &amp; Dove as his own personal predators or kill them. Â Waller tried to stop him as he flew off in an exo-suit to retrieve the avian duo himself. Â Freitag very nearly defeated them until Sasha and Wiley were able to establish physical contact, giving them both a power boost able to rip apart Freitag's exo-suit. Â Meanwhile, Waller ordered the Suicide Squad to stand down and bring Freitag into custody. Â Waller offered Hawk &amp; Dove a position working for the government under her auspices. Â Sasha was willing, but Wiley declined working for \"The Man\". Â Wiley confessed his love for Sasha as he kissed her departed.</p><p>Apparently, Hawk &amp; Dove remained partners, as they both appeared in a membership drive for a Titans West Coast team.</p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Hawk &amp; Dove can manifest wings by mentally willing them to sprout from their backs. Â This enables them to fly. Â Hawk &amp; Dove also possess a sonic shriek ability. Â The duo also experience a boost in powers, increasing their strength, stamina and endurance, when they are in close proximity to each other.</p>",

She was a member of the scientific team who mutated <a data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\" href=\"/julia-carpenter/4005-16197/\" slug=\"julia-carpenter\">Spider-Woman</a>/Julia Cornwall-Carpenter. At the time she worked for the Commission of Superhuman Activities under <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14860\" href=\"/valerie-cooper/4005-14860/\" slug=\"valerie-cooper\">Valerie Cooper</a>. Sylvie later took a variant of the spider-serum and transformed herself to Arachne. She is a member of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-46952\" href=\"/deathweb/4060-46952/\" slug=\"deathweb\">Deathweb</a> and an enemy of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\" href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" slug=\"avengers\">Avengers</a>. Ironically her archenemy is Julia, the woman she herself empowered.</p><h2>Powers And Abilities</h2><p>Arachne fires both physical and psychic webs from glands in her wrists. However the process is painful to her and she wears special gauntlets which somehow ease her pain. The gauntlets double as weapons, each extending a spike covered in spider-venom. The venom is lethal to humans and victims die within seconds. She is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant.</p>",

During his space flight, Vladimir was bombarded by cosmic radiation and received super-malleable powers similar to Mr. Fantastic. Dr. Vladimir Volkh would become the leaderÂ of the <a href=\"///\">        Bogatyri</a>, a super-powered group of Russians that is fiercely loyal to the Motherland. The Bogatyri named for the \"Valiant Champions of Elder Days\" in Russian folklore are a group of superhuman Russians that infiltrate a Canadian Distant Early Warning base to set motion Operation Polaris where they plan to start a new Cold War and start a deadlier Ice Age to freeze the entire North American Continent. The Canadian base they invaded was developing a prototype of a quick-freeze crystal and these ice crystals multiply and spread very quickly in all directions. The core crystal absorbs heat from the air, imparts that power causing secondary crystals to grow at a rapid rate. Glaciers would form and keep moving south until the entire United States became a continent of ice.Â <br/><br/>Dr. Volkh and his team would come into conflict with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">        Wolverine</a> and members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\" href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" slug=\"avengers-west-coast\">        West Coast Avengers</a>.

However they are saved by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\" href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" slug=\"usagent\">        US Agent</a> and the Scarlet Witch manages to shut down the crystal with her hex bolts. Dr. Volkh and his plans to start a new Cold War is thwarted and the Bogatyri escape in their hovercraft. The current whereabouts of Dr. Volkh are unknown.Â   <br/><h2>Creation<br/></h2>Doctor Volkh was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\" href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" slug=\"roy-thomas\">   Roy Thomas</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42068\" href=\"/dann-thomas/4040-42068/\" slug=\"dann-thomas\">  Dann Thomas</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-7642\" href=\"/dave-ross/4040-7642/\" slug=\"dave-ross\"> David Ross</a> in 1992 and first appeared in Avengers West Coast # 87.Â Â  <br/><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<br/></h2><br/><b> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/838216-dv4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838216\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.125\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/838216-dv4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838216\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/838216-dv4.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/838216-dv4.jpg 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" data-width=\"192\"></a></figure></b><b>Â </b><b> </b><br/>Dr. Volkh has the ability to convert the mass of his entire body into a malleable state.

The event causedÂ irreparable damage to his lungs and limbs but provided him with freakish strength.Â He receivedÂ cybernetic implants in different parts of his body and was named Svyatogor after the mightiest of Slavic heroes.Â He joined the Â <a data-ref-id=\"4060-44522\" href=\"/bogatyri/4060-44522/\" slug=\"bogatyri\">     Bogatyri</a> named for the \"Valiant Champions of Elder Days\" in Russian folklore which are a group of superhuman Russians led by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46953\" href=\"/doctor-volkh/4005-46953/\" slug=\"doctor-volkh\">     Dr. Vladimir Volkh</a>. They infiltrate a Canadian Distant Early Warning base to set motion Operation Polaris where they plan to start a new Cold War and start a deadlier Ice Age to freeze the entire North American Continent. The Canadian base they invaded was developing a prototype of a quick-freeze crystal and these ice crystals multiply and spread very quickly in all directions. The core crystal absorbs heat from the air, imparts that power causing secondary crystals to grow at a rapid rate. Glaciers would form and keep moving south until the entire United States became a continent of ice.Â <br/><br/>After taking over the base, two members of the Bogatyri named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46954\" href=\"/svyatogor/4005-46954/\" slug=\"svyatogor\">     Svyatogor</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42916\" href=\"/morning-star/4005-42916/\" slug=\"morning-star\">     Zvezda Dennista</a> captured <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">     Logan</a> while he was backpacking in the Canadian wilderness. However Wolverine is assisted by members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\" href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" slug=\"avengers-west-coast\">     West Coast Avengers</a> and thwart the Bogatyri's plans for a newÂ Cold War. The team manages to escape in their hovercraft and the current whereabouts of Svyatogor are unknown.Â Â Â  <br/><h2>Creation<br/></h2>Svyatogor was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\" href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" slug=\"roy-thomas\">   Roy Thomas</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42068\" href=\"/dann-thomas/4040-42068/\" slug=\"dann-thomas\">  Dann Thomas</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-7642\" href=\"/dave-ross/4040-7642/\" slug=\"dave-ross\"> David Ross</a> in 1992 and first appeared in Avengers West Coast # 87.Â  <br/><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<br/></h2><br/><b> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/838223-sv3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838223\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.80902777777778\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/838223-sv3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838223\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/838223-sv3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/838223-sv3.jpg 288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\" data-width=\"288\"></a></figure></b><b>Wonder Man vs Svyatogor</b><br/>Svyatogor has cybernetic implantsÂ in different parts of his body and possesses superhuman strength and durability.

He has total authority and jurisdiction over any Watcher who is brought to trial for violating their oath of non-interference.Â <br />Â <br />Emnu was initially the only member of the High Tribunal to vote against sharing their knowledge with other races. He believed that their knowledge was the result of hard work and should not be offered for free. When Ikor's help led to the self-destruction of the Prosilicans in a nuclear war, Emnu was quick to point it out. </p>",

    "deck": "Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Borden was a hatchet murderess revived by Satannish to serve in his Lethal Legion.",
    "description": "<h2>Life</h2><p>Lizzie Andrew Borden was born in 1860. She was a descendant of <a href=\"/winston-churchill/4005-31245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31245\">Winston Churchill</a>. She lived in New England during the late nineteenth century in Fall River, <a href=\"/massachusetts/4020-55745/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55745\">Massachusetts</a>. She was a spinster, who resided with her father, Andrew Borden, and stepmother, Abby Borden. Her family owned the Borden Milk Company. It is rumored that Lizzie, at the age of 32, murdered her parents with a hatchet on August 4th, 1892. The murders, the trial that followed, and scrutiny by the media made Lizzie an infamous celebrity. Lizzie was acquitted of the crimes, however no other suspect was ever tried or arrested for the brutal acts. Following the murders, Lizzie became a recluse, and was not heard from again, until her death from Pneumonia in 1927. She had suffered a year-long bout with illness caused by gall bladder removal surgery, prior to her death.</p><p> </p><h2>Marvel</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/91748-8636-lethal-legion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-91748\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5125\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/91748-8636-lethal-legion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-91748\"><img alt=\"Lethal Legion \" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/229/91748-8636-lethal-legion.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/91748-8636-lethal-legion.jpg 400w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/229/91748-8636-lethal-legion.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Lethal Legion </figcaption></figure><p>After her death, Lizzie was sent to the Splinter Realm of <a href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">Hell </a>controlled by <a href=\"/satannish/4005-13799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13799\">Satannish</a>, which previously belonged to <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a>. Satannish stole Lizzie's soul, along with three others, to form his deadly <a href=\"/lethal-legion/4060-42128/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42128\">Lethal Legion</a>. He intended to use the team to seek vengeance against the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\">West Coast Avengers </a>for defeating him. Satannish promised the Lethal Legion that he would resurrect them if they brought him the souls of the West Coast Avengers. Satannish imbued Lizzie with superhuman abilities, that he could increase or decrease at will. Satannish also replaced Lizzie's right hand with a two-sided axe. Lizzie also used axes as throwing weapons. She later participated in the brutal beating of <a href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\">US Agent</a>, and slew <a href=\"/stella-houston/4005-60579/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60579\">Stella Houston</a>. Houston was <a href=\"/hangman/4005-13956/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13956\">Hangman</a>'s former lover. However, Houston's murder was merely a diversion, so that the other members of the Lethal Legion could abduct <a href=\"/mockingbird/4005-2497/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2497\">Mockingbird</a>, and Lizzie fled from <a href=\"/arachne/4005-16197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Spider-Woman </a>and <a href=\"/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">War Machine</a>. Following her escape, Lizzie rejoined the other members of the Lethal Legion in Satannish's realm.</p><p> </p><p>Satannish used his powers to force the West Coast Avengers into his realm. He, along with the Lethal Legion, succeeded in defeating the team. However, Mephisto, having stolen <a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a>'s form, snuck into the realm, and demanded that Satannish return the souls that he had stolen from him. Satannish stole back the power that he had imbued the Lethal Legion with, in order to defeat Mephisto. Without their powers, the West Coast Avengers easily defeated the legion. Later, Lizzie's soul was destroyed, when both Mephisto and Satannish fought over the souls of the Lethal Legion.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers And Abilities</h2><ul><li>Lizzie's natural physical attributes were modified with magic by Satannish. She was of normal height and weight for a woman her age, who engaged in regular physical activity.</li><li>Lizzie had been fitted with a two-sided axe by Satannish, which replaced her right hand. She also utilized throwing axes as weapons.</li></ul>",

    "deck": "Othon von Salzas was an intergalactic pirate who became the very first Metabaron.",
    "description": "<p>Othon von Salzas lived his life as a space pirate until he met Edna, the woman who would be his wife. The story of their meeting is a mystery, but they quickly fell in love. Othon gave up pirating and moved to Marmola, the planet Edna's family lived on and ruled. Edna's father, Baron Berard of Castaka, never approved of Othon, but he didn't stop his daughter from marrying him. Othon took up his new family's business of carving marble. </p><p>Marmola was a planet made entirely of marble and all the richest men came from around the galaxy to purchase finely cut marble from the Castaka's. In addition to their amazing stone cutting techniques, the Castakas had a secret. In caves beneath the planet was a blue substance called epiphyte that when placed into objects made them defy gravity. The epiphyte was used to transport the huge blocks of marble since the Castaka's didn't use very much advanced technology.        </p><p>One day dignitaries from the Imperial Merchants Guild arrived on the planet and purchased some marble. While it was being cut there was an accident and tons of marble fell on Othon, trapping him. Edna knew it would take too long to cut the marble away so she demanded that her father use the epiphyte to free Othon but Berard said no, refusing to reveal the secret of the epiphyte in front of the dignitaries. Other stone cutters sided with Edna and Berard was overruled. As soon as Othon was freed and learned what had happened he was furious. He knew that revealing their secret would cause an intergalactic war when everyone found out about the epiphyte and decided they wanted it for themselves. When Berard saw Othon's anger he finally accepted him as his son, but the damage had been done.       </p><p>That night, the dignitaries left with their marble and Berard held a meeting. During the meeting he and Othon took out weapons and fought. Berard took a hit to lure Othon into striking range. Berard won but spared Othon, teaching him one last lesson about sacrifice. Following their battle Berard opened his shirt and showed Othon the Castakan birthmark, a glowing white bird in the center of his chest. He said that the mark is passed down from baron to baron and said that it now belonged to Othon. Berard didn't want to be alive when the war for the epiphyte began so he willed the birthmark onto Othon's chest and held his breath until he died.       </p><p>Ten days later, the battle began. Ships from all over the galaxy warred in the skies above Marmola and after a time only the Black Endoguard remained. On the planet, Othon's wife (Edna) and son (Bari) were ready to fight the entire legion of Black Endoguard warriors, an army that numbered over 4500, but Othon told them to wait. He had a plan but his family wouldn't hear it. Othon broke Bari's legs so he couldn't get out into battle but Edna got past him and ran out of the castle to be shot to pieces. After his wife's death Othon told his army the plan. He ordered his army to split into two and take the Black Endoguard from the North and South, and engage that in close combat, the specialty of Othon's people. Othon let his two best generals go into battle and attack from the sides while he went alone to combat them head on. By the end of the battle Othon had killed more than 1500 men with nothing but a dagger. After the fight, Othon paid respects to his lost friends and family and took after his son.</p> <p> A week later the Imperial Couple arrived on Marmola and they worked out a deal to get the epiphyte. Othon was made obscenely rich, was given a new planet, and was gifted with the last horse in the galaxy, which he gave to his son. Bari formed a deep connection with his steed while his legs healed but one night thieves came to the planet and stole it. Bari went after them but Othon didn't think he would catch the criminals since his legs were still weak. Othon took off after them in the dense fog and killed the first three without a problem. The last one was riding away on the horse and Othon threw his spear through its chest and unhorsed the man. Othon drew closer and was horrified to see that he had killed his son. While he was grieving the last thief shot him and destroyed his pelvis. Othon killed him and was only able to make it back to his palace with the aid of his dead son's horse.       </p><p>Othon got cybernetic implants to repair his damaged body (starting the metabaronic tradition of mutilation and mechanical replacements) and spent a large part of his fortune creating the first metabaronic weapons. Filled with suffering and rage after the loss of his son and inability to have another (since his destroyed reproductive organs had been replaced with machinary like the rest of his pelvic area) Othon became a violent and dangerous man. He kept his two concubines although they could not satisfy him, and they were not allowed to speak in his presence.        </p><p>One night Othon heard news that the royal couple's fetus had finally been created (the emperor was sterile so the fetus had to be made in a lab on a far away planet) and that it was being transported to the royal couple. Othon new that if he had heard it then criminals and pirates would have as well and that the fetus was in danger. Sure enough the transport ship was attacked by ships launched from a hidden base disguised as a planet. The Purple Endoguard ships defending the transport ship were outnumbered and while they could hold off the attackers, they couldn't defeat them. The battle went on for weeks and the call went out for anyone with ideas to turn the tide. Othon, a brilliant strategist, had a plan immediately and flew to the golden planet where the royal couple lived. Once he landed the guards tried to stop him because he had come unannounced, but he took down any man who stood in his way and walked straight up to the royal couple. He told them his plan and was given the remaining ships of the fleet and flew to the battle. The other ships were painted to hide in an asteroid field while Othon to his ship to the planet/base and attacked it. When the enemy ships saw their base under attack they flew through the asteroids to reach Othon but where destroyed by the hidden ships. Othon then went to take his place at the head of the ships protecting the transport vessel but he was ordered to go to the back. Insulted, he flew his ship through the armored transport, stole the fetus, and flew off to the golden planet at faster-than-light speeds that no other ship had ever, or would ever, reach.       </p><p>When Othon reached the golden planet and presented the royal family with their child (male and female Siamese twins joined at the back, a prophecy fulfilling child) he was knighted as Metabaron. The royal couple promised Othon a that they would search the galaxy for a gift that would fulfill him.        </p><p>Some time later an imperial vessel landed on Othon's planet. His gift had arrived. Into his castle walked a woman that was to be his wife. The woman was Honorata, a priestess of Shabda-Oud. The priestesses were largely considered whores and witches so Othon was not pleased to see her at first. When he looked into her eyes though, that changed. Othon's concubines pleaded for him to kill her and said she had put a spell on him, but Othon sent them away. </p><p>Othon and Honorata soon fell madly in love but because of Othon's robotic parts, nothing could come of it. One night, during a lunar eclipse, Honorata took Othon to their room and pricked his finger with her nail telling him that he would have a child of his blood...</p><p>Nine months later Othon's servant told him that his concubines had taken Honorata to the top of the palace and were going to throw her off. He took his sons horse and rode to his armory. Loading one of his guns with a dart full of epiphyte, he ran to a ledge where he could see his concubines about to jump with his wife. As they did, Othon shot Honorata. She floated and her would-be murderers fell to their deaths. Othon got in his ship and went to pick Honorata up, but before he could she gave birth in midair. Once they were in the ship Honorata told Othon that she had given birth to a son and they named him <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46973\" href=\"/aghnar/4005-46973/\" slug=\"aghnar\">Aghnar</a>. She also told him that he could never tell anyone that Aghnar was a boy. She then revealed why.</p><p>Honorata had been sent chosen by the other priestesses of Shabda-Oud to be Othon's gift in order to seduce him and have a special child. She had planned on giving birth to a hermaphrodite so it would fulfill a prophecy saying that an androgynous being would one day rule the galaxy. It's father being the most dangerous man in existence would also add to its power. Fortunately, in her time with Othon she had genuinely fallen in love with him and so she gave him the son he had wanted.</p><p>Part of her plan had included kidnapping the child when it was 7 and delivering it to her masters, but now that she loved Othon, they had to figure out a way to protect his child. They settled on keeping the child's sex a secret for the seven years, hoping to have a proper plan by then. That night while they were sleeping, Aghnar started to float out of his crib. As soon as Othon realized that the epiphyte that had save Honorata's life had made his son weightless, he screamed in fury and took up a knife to kill his son, a boy that would never become a real warrior. Honorata was only able to stop him by revealing that the effort that she had used to have the boy had left her sterile, meaning that if he died, there would no chance for Othon to have another son. Honorata clamped weights on Aghnar's legs so he would be grounded and Othon decided to let him live, but said that he could not bear to see his son. Honorata agreed to take him away and train him for the seven years that were assured to them. At the end of that time they would return and Othon would test him to see if he was worthy, and if not, he would kill the boy and himself, ending the line of Metabarons before it started.</p><p>Seven years later, Aghnar and Honorata returned to the castle riding a winged beast and ready for the test. Othon had decided to pit his son against a robo-killer, a nearly indestructible machine with eight blade covered arms. The only way to destroy it was by avoiding the arms and setting off its self-destruct mechanism. The battle lasted for over an hour but Aghnar eventually won. Othon was displeased because Aghnar had used his flying abilities so he devised another test. He put his sons legs in a device that would squeeze them until Aghnar told it to stop. It was horrible test of strength of will and pain tolerance, but Aghnar passed, not protesting once until his legs were completely removed. After the ordeal, Othon grafted robotic legs to his sons body, finally giving him real weight and making him a Metabaron.</p><p>Soon after that, three priestesses of the Shabda-Oud arrived to inspect Othon's son. Aghnar killed all three of them but their ship was still in orbit. The thing was a cetacyborg, a creature made of flesh, magic and technology that was capable of destroying worlds. Othon took his ship to space to fight the monster ship but he found it to be indestructible. The only way he could to see to beat it was to attack from inside of it. He flew inside the beasts mouth and headed for its brain. Even that was nearly impossible though since the cetacyborg's body produced destructive acids capable of eating through his ship. By the time he reached the brain much of his ship had been eroded and he was practically drinking in the monster's acid by the mouthful. He eventually killed the beast and made it out but his lungs had been corroded and he was coughing up blood.</p><p>When Othon returned to the planet he loaded up the Metabunker and was preparing to take his family to another planet when Honorata revealed that she couldn't go with him. The Priestesses had implanted a micro-H bomb in her heart so if she ever betrayed them whatever planet she was on would be destroyed. She knew that it would soon explode but she hadn't wanted to slow Othon down so she hadn't told him about the bomb until right when he was leaving. Othon was forced to take his son and leave his wife, but he vowed to get revenge on the Shabda-Oud.       </p> <p>The Metabunker landed on the planet Perdita, a place with extreme gravity, enormous insects and floating apes. On the planet, Othon told Aghnar that he had spy-needles all over the universe that would tell him where the Shabda-Oud planet was, but it would be ten years before the signals would reach Perdita. That meant that Aghnar had ten years to prepare to face the witches of the Shabda-Oud. At that point, Othon told Aghnar that he would have to kill him. The acid in Othon's body would kill him in a few days but he wanted Aghnar to kill him before then. It would prove to Othon that Aghnar was truly worthy of being the next Metabaron. At first Aghnar refused but when Othon attacked he was forced to defend himself. Aghnar used the mental powers his mother had gifted him to paralyze his father but Othon told him that he had oko mini-bombs implanted all over his body and they would detonate if Aghnar touched him the wrong way. Aghnar reasoned that Othon couldn't have bombs in his brain if he could think properly, so he drove his weapon through his father's skull and killed him.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2><a data-ref-id=\"4005-46973\" href=\"/aghnar/4005-46973/\" slug=\"aghnar\">Aghnar</a></h2>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Unnatural Birth</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-46972\" href=\"/othon-von-salzas/4005-46972/\" slug=\"othon-von-salzas\">Othon von Salzas</a>, Aghnar's father, had been castrated when his pelvis was blasted by a thief, meaning that he could not have children. Aghnar was only born because his mother was Honorata, a priestess of the Shabda-Oud. She had many unexplained powers, one of which allowed her to turn a drop of Othon's blood into sperm inside her body so she could be impregnated. </p><p>Nine months later Othon's servant told him that his concubines had taken Honorata to the top of the palace and were going to throw her off. He took his horse and rode to his armory. Loading one of his guns with a dart full of epiphyte, he ran to a ledge where he could see his concubines about to jump with his wife. As they did, Othon shot Honorata. She floated and her would-be murderers fell to their deaths. Othon got in his ship and went to pick Honorata up, but before he could, she gave birth in midair. Once they were in the ship Honorata told Othon that she had given birth to a son and they named him Aghnar. She also told him that he could never tell anyone that Aghnar was a boy. She then revealed why.</p><p>Honorata had been sent chosen by the other priestesses of Shabda-Oud to be Othon's gift in order to seduce him and have a special child. She had planned on giving birth to a hermaphrodite so it would fulfill a prophecy saying that an androgynous being would one day rule the galaxy. It's father being the most dangerous man in existence would also add to its power. Fortunately, in her time with Othon she had genuinely fallen in love with him and so she gave him the son he had wanted.</p><p>Part of her plan had included kidnapping the child when it was 7 and delivering it to her masters, but now that she loved Othon, they had to figure out a way to protect his child. They settled on keeping the child's sex a secret for the seven years, hoping to have a proper plan by then. That night while they were sleeping, Aghnar started to float out of his crib. As soon as Othon realized that the epiphyte that had save Honorata's life had made his son weightless, he screamed in fury and took up a knife to kill his son, a boy that would never become a real warrior. Honorata was only able to stop him by revealing that the effort that she had used to have the boy had left her sterile, meaning that if he died, there would no chance for Othon to have another son. Honorata clamped weights on Aghnar's legs so he would be grounded and Othon decided to let him live, but said that he could not bear to see his son. Honorata agreed to take him away and train him for the seven years that were assured to them. At the end of that time they would return and Othon would test him to see if he was worthy, and if not, he would kill the boy and himself, ending the line of Metabarons before it started.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>The Seven Years</h2><p>Honorata took Aghnar to the sacred mountain Anasirma. It was a forbidden and dangerous place with deadly chasms and even more deadly beasts. They found a cave of crystals and made that their home. In the cave Aghnar found and befriended a woolly toad and even taught it to speak. When Aghnar turned five, Honorata told him to kill his pet and friend. Before dying the creature asked, \"Why Master?\" and Aghnar responded, \"Duty comes before love.\" Aghnar took his sword and sliced him in two, shedding one tear as he did so. For crying, Honorata whipped him, leaving a scar that would never heal. Using Shabda-Oud meditation techniques, Aghnar learned to control his nervous system and free his body from the tyranny of pain. After this had been mastered, Honorata began to train her son in combat. She fought him at every opportunity, often ambushing him as he did routine chores. He learned never to trust anyone, not even his mother, and eventually he was no longer caught off guard when she attacked. She periodically added more weights to him to build up his strength as they trained. Honorata had superhuman strength as well as psychic abilities and he was forced to fight her every day, learning to use and defend against weapons of the body and the mind. On the day before his seventh birthday Aghnar finally beat his mother. She clad him in armor and gave him a sword, telling him that the next day he would meet his father. Riding a winged beast, Aghnar and Honorata returned to Othon and his castle.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Testing</h2><p>To test Aghnar, Othon had decided to pit his son against a robo-killer, a nearly indestructible machine with eight blade covered arms. The only way to destroy it was by avoiding the arms and setting off its self-destruct mechanism. The battle lasted for over an hour but Aghnar eventually won. Othon was displeased because Aghnar had used his flying abilities so he devised another test. He put his sons legs in a device that would squeeze them until Aghnar told it to stop. It was horrible test of his strength of will and pain tolerance, but Aghnar passed, not protesting once until his legs were completely removed. After the ordeal, Othon grafted robotic legs to his sons body, finally giving him real weight and making him a Metabaron.</p><p>Soon after that, three priestesses of the Shabda-Oud arrived to inspect Othon's son. Aghnar went to meet them acting as if he would show them that he was indeed a hermaphrodite, but he instead attacked them with his claw-tipped prosthesis that were coated in epiphyte, which caused the witches to float, making them easy targets for him. He then faced the Mother Superior in a telepathic duel and after tapping into his motherâs psychic powers, won the battle.</p> <p> After this battle, Othon flew to space to destroy the witchesâ cetacyborg ship but in the battle was forced to enter the living vesselâs mouth and inhale some of its digestive acids, which would eventually kill him. When he returned to the planet he decided they must leave it so the witches donât come back for revenge, but Honorata revealed that she couldn't leave with them because the witches replaced her heart with a bomb and they would blow it up soon for betraying them. Aghnar and Othon left the planet as it exploded and journeyed to another planet where Aghnar would train in secret for the day he could get revenge on the witches of Shabda-Oud.</p> <p>  The Metabunker landed on the planet Perdita, a place with extreme gravity, enormous insects and floating apes. On the planet, Othon told Aghnar that he had spy-needles all over the universe that would tell him where the Shabda-Oud planet was, but it would be ten years before the signals would reach Perdita. That meant that Aghnar had ten years to prepare to face the witches of the Shabda-Oud. At that point, Othon told Aghnar that he would have to kill him. The acid in Othon's body would kill him in a few days but he wanted Aghnar to kill him before then. It would prove to Othon that Aghnar was truly worthy of being the next Metabaron. At first Aghnar refused but when Othon attacked he was forced to defend himself. Aghnar used the mental powers his mother had gifted him to paralyze his father but Othon told him that he had oko mini-bombs implanted all over his body and they would detonate if Aghnar touched him the wrong way. Aghnar reasoned that Othon couldn't have bombs in his brain if he could think properly, so he drove his weapon through his father's skull and killed him.Â </p><h2>Revenge</h2><p>  After killing his father, Aghnar transplanted all his mini-bombs into his own body and began to explore the planet. One day he saw a falling ape and rescued it before it landed on the ground and died. He found that it was sentient and let it take him to its people up in the clouds. Once there Aghnar saw why the ape had fallen. The eldest ape was defending its title as leader by killing its challengers. Aghnar decided to kill the leader and become ruler of the apes because before going up into the sky with the rescued ape, he had received a message from the spy-needles telling him where the Shabda-Oud were but he knew couldnât defeat them and their cetacyborgs on his own and would need an army. After becoming the leader of the apes he told them that he would take them to a new and better place. With the help of the floating apes he took control of one of the cetacyborgs and its pilots, forcing to tell him their secret mission, which was to kidnap Oda, the most beautiful woman in the galaxy in order to produce a hermaphrodite. When Aghnar learned of Oda he instantly fell in love and decided he wanted her as his wife.</p> <p>  Aghnar was able to win the heart of Oda who agreed to help him with his plan for revenge. Aghnar, disguised as a witch, delivered Oda to the Shabda-Oud in order to gain entrance to their base. The plan went wrong when Jejoh, the witchâs invulnerable god was summoned and Aghnar was forced to act too soon. Â  He released the apes to attack the witches while he fought Jejoh, sacrificing his arm in order to kill him. With Jejoh and most of the witches dead, Aghnar fought the elder witches but needed Odaâs help to win. He defeated them and gave the apes a new home, but Odaâs mind was lost in the process.Â </p><h2>A Family</h2><p>After the psychic battle, a mysterious woman appeared and brought Aghnar and Oda to safety. The stranger turned out to be Honorata, who had not died years before but had used her psychic powers to save herself by stopping time for 20 years (her perspective) 5 minutes before the bomb went off so her robots could study the bomb and remove it. With the remaining 5 minutes she had fled the planet and now had returned to her sonâs aid and promised to save Oda, at the cost of her own life. The psycho-surgical operation was a success and Oda was saved. Aghnar and Oda conceived a child but on the day it was born Aghnar discovered that Honorata had actually placed her mind in Odaâs body. In a rage, Aghnar took his gun and blew off his sonâs head. Aghnar advised Honorata/Oda to attach the baby to a machine if she desired to save it (he had only wanted to kill its spirit, which he did by blowing off its head) and that he would come back one day and kill the child. Honorata/Oda vowed to make the child the best warrior ever so he would take his fatherâs place as Metabaron. </p> <p>After leaving his mother/wife and son, Aghnar made the position of Metabaron a mercenary one, demanding to be paid to kill instead of just serving the empire. He took many missions and killed many beings and even whole civilizations until one day, after years and years of murder, he was hired by another galaxy to destroy his home galaxy. To match the threat he posed, Aghnarâs home galaxy hired his son, now called Steelhead, to protect them. </p> <p>The two mercenaries began a fight to the death in space that ranged through all dimensions. Neither could win until Aghnar used his psychic powers to overwhelm Steelhead. In response, Steelhead began to mutilate Honorata/Oda who he had brought with him until Aghnar surrendered. Unable to live anymore, Agnhar killed himself and Honorata/Oda joined him to be away from the monster she created.</p><h2><a data-ref-id=\"4005-46974\" href=\"/steelhead/4005-46974/\" slug=\"steelhead\">Steelhead</a></h2>",

    "deck": "Steelhead was the third Metabaron.",
    "description": "<h2>Unnatural BirthÂ </h2><a data-ref-id=\"4005-46973\" href=\"/aghnar/4005-46973/\" slug=\"aghnar\">Aghnar</a> and Oda were the biological parents of Steelhead, but his birth was far more complicated than that.Â Â Steelheadâs grandmother Honorata had used her psychic powers to put her mind into Odaâs body without Aghnarâs knowledge. When Aghnar found out on the day of Steelheadâs birth, he had a psychic battle with Honorata/Oda and then blasted the head off of his child. Aghnar advised Honorata/Oda to attach the baby to a machine if she desired to save it (he had only wanted to kill its spirit, which he did by blowing off its head) and that he would come back one day and kill the child. Honorata/Oda vowed to make the child the best warrior ever so he would take his fatherâs place as Metabaron.Â  What exactly Steelhead did with Honorata/Oda for the next couple decades is unclear, but presumably she trained him in all the physical and mental skills she knew and taught him to overcome all pain and emotion in order to make him the ultimate warrior. What is known is that she created a head of weapons for him and gave him the name Steelhead.Â <br/><br/> After many years had passed and Aghnar had become a mercenary working with another galaxy to destroy his home galaxy, Steelhead reappeared. He offered to fight his father and protect the galaxy. To prove that he was a match for his father, his first demonstration of power was to use the fire of his spirit to mentally twist and sculpt a large section of the imperial city into a huge flower. Realizing that Steelhead was their only hope, the human galaxy hired him to fight his father to defend them.Â <br/><br/> The two mercenaries began a fight to the death in space that started in a black hole of their creation and ranged through all dimensions. Neither could win until Aghnar used his psychic powers to overwhelm Steelhead. In response, Steelhead began to mutilate Honorata/Oda who he had brought with him until Aghnar surrendered. Unable to live anymore, Agnhar killed himself and Honorata/Oda joined him to be away from the monster she had created.Â Â <br/>Â <br/><h2>Supreme MetabaronÂ </h2>Â Steelhead saved the galaxy but was despised for the methods he had used. He decided he didnât care though and he knew that when the galaxy needed him, they would call for him whether they respected him or not since he was now the single most powerful being alive. He was right and they needed him not long after that. Apparently his battle with his father had split a crack in the universe and otherworldly vampires had come in and started devouring people. Only Steelhead could seal the breach so the empire begged him to save them. He agreed but on only on the condition that he be made Supreme Metabaron and be given the Medallion of High Nobility. The empire agreed and Steelhead sealed the breach and was given the title of Supreme Metabaron. However, he couldnât get the Medallion of High Nobility because it requires the agreement of all planetary ambassadors and Don Nicanor Rosamel de Rokha would never agree. To fix this, Steelhead went to Don Nicanorâs planet where he found him meditating in the Halerce, the oldest tree in the galaxy, surrounded millions of dulcet-voiced Dyukka birds. Without hesistation, Steelhead killed Don Nicanor, destroying the tree and all the birds at the same time. Â He then went to receive his medallion.Â <br/><br/> As Steelhead was about to finally get his medallion, Dona Vicenta, daughter of Don Nicanor, appeared in the royal chambers and accused Steelhead of killing her father. To prevent him from being decorated, she voted against him and attempted to kill herself. Steelhead stopped her, but her words cut him to the core, especially her prediction that he would be the end of the Metabaronic line since without a brain, he couldnât know true love and heâd never have a child of passion like the previous Metabarons had been. Steelhead ordered Dona Vicente to be kept alive on her planet so that he could discover what true love was and one day return and prove her wrong.Â <br/>Â <br/><h2>MelmothÂ </h2>After failing to understand love through ancient texts, Steelhead set out to find someone to teach him and finds Zaran, the last living poet who was said to have died 5000 years ago. Steelhead went through many trials to reach him, but eventually made his way to Zaran, who he discovered had become a living head attached to machines. Since Zaran said that emotions canât be taught, only felt, he and Steelhead decided to merge their organic parts and become a new being. The operation was a success and the poet-warrior Melmoth was born.Â <br/>Â <br/>Of course, Melmoth discovered that he was in love with Dona Vicenta and had to find a way to win her back. He found a way to replace her tree and birds and when they finally spoke to each other, his words seduced her. However, as soon as she found out that the man she fell in love with was the same man she hated, she attempted to take her life yet again with Melmothâs own revolver. To save his love, Melmoth used his psychic powers to stop time and deflect the bullet so it only knocked her out. Â Â Â <br/>Â <br/>While she was unconscious, Melmoth cloned her father in order to obtain forgiveness from Dona Vicenta.Â Â The cloned Don Nincanor was physically perfect, but somehow lost part of his memory. When he was reunited with his daughter his mistook her daughterly love for him as lust and he responded in kind, wanting her for himself. Don Nicanor attempted to rape his daughter but Melmoth stopped him. Don Nicanor rallied his people to attack Melmoth and to prevent Melmoth from killing her father and her people, Dona Vicenta asked her father what he loved most about her. When he said it was her eyes, she ripped them out and gave them to him and only then did he realize that it was his daughter he had been after. Tormented by his own actions, he consented to her marriage to Melmoth and his decoration with the Medallion of High Nobility. <h2>The Return of Steelhead</h2> <p>Melmoth married Dona Vicenta but after their wedding night, she revealed to him her cybernetic eyes and the ugliness of them split Melmoth, with the poet side of him no longer desiring her. At the same time, the planet they were on fell under attack and Steelhead desired to go to battle. With his poet head resisting the fight and his love, Steelhead found no more use for it and blew it off and regained control of his being. Steelheadâs reemergence saved the planet, but also showed Dona Vicenta how ruthless he was and made her begin to hate him. </p> <p>Later, Dona Vicenta revealed that she was pregnant but also diseased. She had conceived twins, but her health prevented her from delivering both. The twins were a boy and a girl but a Metabaron could only be male so Steelhead would have to save that one if he wanted to pass on his title. However, Dona Vicenta said she would only live to raise her daughter. Steelhead secretly had the brain of the boy put into the body of the girl so he could save his clan and his wife, but Dona Vicentaâs health only got worse. To save her, Steelhead used technology to preserve her in a state of near-death.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Barnyard Dawg is a guard dog who is constantly being bothered by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21372\" href=\"/foghorn-leghorn/4005-21372/\" slug=\"foghorn-leghorn\">Foghorn Leghorn</a>. He is always fighting with him although he usually looses. Some of his victories occur when a little chicken hawk comes to get the much larger Foghorn. Foghorn tries to trick it into eating Barnyard Dawg, but the dog ends up getting it to take Foghorn. Most of his fights with Foghorn begin while he is sleeping and Foghorn gets a piece of wood and smacks Barnyard Dawg while he sleeps.</p>",

He is the father of Uatu, who is earth's solar system's assigned Watcher. Ikor was the being that drafted the Watcher's Code of Ethics, requiring that they merely observe the events in the multiverse and forbidding them from interfering in them.Â <br />Â <br />The beings that would become the Watchers reached virtual immortality and acquired god-like powers. Ikor considered it an act of generocity to share their knowledge with less fortunate races, helping them along similar paths. He led the first such mission to another planet. They offered the secrets of nuclear energy to the \"primitive\" Prosilicans (whose technology was about the same as pre-World War II Earth).Â Â <br />Â <br />The various states of planet Prosilicus used said secrets to build nuclear weapons. Warring factions anihilated entire cities with ease, small battles escalating to \"Major Holocausts\". \"Carnage spread from continent to continent\". When Ikor led a second visit to Prosilicus, he only found a hand full of survivors sitting on a nuclear wasteland. Ikor vowed that his race would not interfere again with the fates of others. Leading them to become the Watchers, beings bound to observe record but never interfere. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br /></h2>Ephraim Soles was a prospector, scavenger and occasional thief who made his living in the deserts of New Mexico. At one point Ephraim entered the grounds of an abandoned military base. He was not aware the grounds had been used to test gamma-bombs. He located plant life within the base and used it to cook his meal. He later reached the Defenders' headquarters at Elijah, New Mexico. The Defenders took him in and offered him clothes and a place to spend the night. <br /><br />He was within the headquarters when the radioactive plants eaten earlier resulted in a great transformation in him. He was mutated into a plant-like gamma creature. In his new form he went into a mindless rampage. He had superhuman strength and proved invulnerable to telepathy, ice and bioelectricity. His body developed strong tentacles which acted as additional limbs and reformed after every injury. Flowers grew from the tentacles, containing teeth-like organs which attempted to bite others. Those bitten were infected with the same radioactive plants which struggled to take over their own bodies.<br /><br />While Cloud and Gargoyle seemingly managed to kill Ephraim, the body regenerated. Theorizing the plant creature needed moisture to survive, Iceman used his powers to remove all available moisture from the vicinity of Ephraim. The body finally collapsed and died. Later spores left over from the creature were blown away from the wind, resulting in new mutations.",

He is married to a woman named  Kwan Tai-Fun, better known as<a href=\"../../typhoon/29-21228/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Typhoon</a> whom is his wife and partner in the business. Cutlass has an extremely chaotic personality and often 'shoots first' and askes questions later. During two of his cases, he encountered the Defenders. The first case was when a murder had taken place witch he solved with help from the Defenders. The second case was when he and his wife where hired by an elderly woman to find an ancient statue. It proved to be a very difficult case. The Defenders helped out once again, but the uneasy team met with betrays, half-truths and more. Oliver soon took charge of the Defenders team and told them what to do, him being the only person to have any idea of what was going on. His extreme behavior and bossiness however did cause Beast and Gargoyle to get extremely annoyed by him. The case ended up with Oliver solving it. He parted ways with the Defenders, but not before telling them they where getting better, but where not there just yet, and \"not to call him, he would call them\", frustrating the Defenders even more. He has not been seen since.",

    "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Blowtorch Brand was a minor enemy of the <a href=\"/defenders/4060-26333/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\">Defenders</a>. He was a really slimeball arsonist whose only superhuman ability was an immunity to fire. He tried to pick a bar fight with <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a>, calling her \"baldy\" and setting her cape on fire. He also sexually harassed <a href=\"/cloud/4005-42846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42846\">Cloud</a>. Cloud reacted by forcing all the oxygen from his lungs, knocking him out.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A few days later Brand was setting a factory on fire so that the owner could collect insurance money. Brand discovered the workers were all illegal immigrants from Mexico. Brand was xenophobic and decided to have the workers burn along with the factory, his own improvisation of the plan. He locked them in the burning building and drew a handgun, preventing anyone from leaving or entering the building. When the Defenders arrived, Brand shot at <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a>, Cloud and <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a> but all dodged his bullets. He actually acquitted himself fairly well, considering that he had no real combat training and a fairly standard power. He was eventually knocked out by <a href=\"/valkyrie/4005-6809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6809\">Valkyrie</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Brand was not seen again, until killed by the <a href=\"/scourge/4005-14461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14461\">Scourge</a>.</p>",
