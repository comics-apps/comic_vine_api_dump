The duo appeared on the big screen in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/beavis-butt-head-do-america/4025-347/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-347\">Beavis &amp; Butt-Head Do America</a>, and were overheard in <em>Airheads. </em>Beavis is voiced by series creator Mike Judge, and named for one of Judge's high school classmates, Bobby Beavis.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Beavis comes for the fictional town of Highland, Texas in which he and his friend and hetero life mate Butt-Head live. Beavis is the illegitimate son of a <a href=\"/motley-crue/4060-56033/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56033\">Motley Crüe</a> roady turned drifter, and is intellectually impaired. It is strongly implied that his mother is given to promiscuity, though she never appears in either the animated series or in the Marvel series. Beavis is employed as a fry cook at Burger World, a fast food restaurant. He has a tattoo on his butt of a butt with a butt-shaped tattoo on it. He enjoys petty vandalism, heavy metal music, and lighting things on fire. When Beavis consumes too much sugar and/or caffeine he develops a split persona known as \"<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/beavis-and-butt-head-431-the-great-cornholio/4070-1012/\" data-ref-id=\"4070-1012\">The Great Cornholio</a>.\" While Beavis is often submissive to Butt-Head's agendas, Cornholio is charismatic, once captivating a coffee house full of hipsters during an open mic night and accidentally becoming the focal point of a cult's beliefs. Oddly, when the Cornholio personality is dominant, Beavis seems to get away with verbally or physically abusing Butt-Head. Beavis and <a href=\"/butthead/4005-52038/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52038\">Butt-Head's</a> stupidity often lands them in comical situations people of normal intelligence would never get into.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Butt-Head is a high school student from Highland, Texas. He can be seen always with his friend Beavis. Out of the two, Butt-Head seems to be the smart one... comparatively speaking.</p><p>Butt-Head is completely unaware that he is not cool. His life revolves around TV and nachos. His goal in life if to do stuff that is cool and score with chicks. He is very confident and will approach any woman and ask her to 'do it' with him. This usally results in him getting slapped or punched and sometimes getting his ass kicked by the girl's boyfriend.</p><p>He constantly bullies Beavis, who seems to take it most of the time. Together they get into crazy situations and usually in trouble. He and Beavis have the ability to start chaotic situations wherever they go.</p>",

    "deck": "Ryuk is a shinigami with a Death Note, who supplied his to Light Yagami. He is strange, and likes apples. Throughout the Death Note series he is obligated to follow Light everywhere.",
    "description": "<b><h2>Origin</h2></b>After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48703\" href=\"/light-yagami/4005-48703/\" slug=\"light-yagami\">Light Yagami</a> discovered Ryuk's dropped the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-52041\" href=\"/death-note/4055-52041/\" slug=\"death-note\">Death Note</a>, he spent 6 years as the self declared god of death Kira. But after nearly being discovered by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49256\" href=\"/l/4005-49256/\" slug=\"l\">L</a> time and time again over the years and ultimately discovered by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50923\" href=\"/near/4005-50923/\" slug=\"near\">Near</a>, and shot multiple times by the police, Light discovered Ryuk's statement to be very true \"someday I will write you in my Death Note\" Light found himself victim of the Shinigami he thought to be his ally, Ryuk.<br/><br/>Ryuk also has an obsession with Apples..... and if he does not eat Apples for prolonged periods of time, he has withdrawls. No one is quite sure as to why he loves Apples in such a way but he does regardless <br/> <br/><h2>Creation </h2>Ryuk was created by writer <a data-ref-id=\"4040-57551\" href=\"/tsugumi-ohba/4040-57551/\" slug=\"tsugumi-ohba\">Tsugumi Ohba</a>, and artist <a data-ref-id=\"4040-52040\" href=\"/takeshi-obata/4040-52040/\" slug=\"takeshi-obata\">Takeshi Obata</a> for the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-20261\" href=\"/death-note/4050-20261/\" slug=\"death-note\">Death Note</a> books. A Shinigami, Ryuk is a Death God. Originally Ryuk was conceived to be younger look, more attractive, and essentially a dark haired, mirror of Light, however his development in the creative process, saw him grow larger, and more monstrous. He is meant to have somewhat of a Rock Star look. Another idea that was floating around when creating the character, was that he may be wearing a mask, to hide a much more attractive face underneath.  <br/> <br/><h2>Powers and Abilities </h2>Incredibly long lived, with the ability to fly. Ryuk is a Shinigami. Although his powers are somewhat ambiguous, by virtue of being a death god, its reasonable to assume he has great supernatural power. He can not be harmed by conventional human weapons. <br/> <br/><b><h2>Media </h2>Death Note Movies</b><br/><br/>Death Note: Ryuk intentionally dropped his book in the human world because he was bored, Light Yagami picked up the book and became Kira, executing criminals with the Death Note. Ryuk eventually made his presence known to Light, and took joy in Light's life, especially when Light was nearly caught.<br/><br/>Death Note II The Last Name: Ryuk and Light remained companions at the beginning of this movie, but as the events of a 2nd Kira (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-55452\" href=\"/misa-amane/4005-55452/\" slug=\"misa-amane\">Misa Amane</a>) unfolded, Light and Misa were found out by L, and were forced to give up their Death Notes, later after Light killed the third Kira who had taken ownership of Misa's Death Note, taking it as his own, and Misa claimed Ryuk's Death Note as her own, also making the \"eye deal\" with Ryuk. In the end, when it was discovered that L had written his own name in the Death Note and faked his own death with the help of the Shinigami Rem, Light was revealed to be Kira, and called out to Ryuk after being shot, Light told Ryuk for the fun to continue all Ryuk would need to do is write one more name in the Death Note, Ryuk wrote a name, the name was Light Yagami. Ryuk then revealed an unwritten rule of the Death Note, A human who uses it can neither go to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42470\" href=\"/heaven/4020-42470/\" slug=\"heaven\">Heaven</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\" href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" slug=\"hell\">Hell</a>, and when they die simply cease to exist.",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Riza Hawkeye had a very difficult childhood. Her father was obsessed with alchemy, specifically flame alchemy. He didn't want anyone to learn his secrets about the topic, so he tattooed the transmutation circle and it's runes on Riza's back. A few years later, <a href=\"/roy-mustang/4005-49318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49318\">Roy Mustang</a> became his apprentice and learned his secrets. Soon after he learned everything about flame alchemy, Mustang decided to join the military's <a href=\"/state-alchemists/4060-50153/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50153\">State Alchemists</a>.

The series first began serialization in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/square-enix/4010-3691/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-3691\">Enix's</a> <em>(later known as Square Enix after 2003)</em> <i>Monthly Shonen Gangan</i> on August 2001.</p><p>She first appears in <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i> Volume 1, Ch. 4 <i>\"Battle on the Train\".</i></p><p>Riza's last name is based on an airplane called the Grumman E-2 Hawkeye. This is a common theme where Arakawa has named many characters based off machines. Also, her last name, Hawkeye, refers to her excellent sniping abilities with the sharp eyes of a hawk. There is some speculation behind the meaning of Riza, because in Hungarian it means \"guardian\". It fits her role of guarding to the secrets of the flame alchemy, and her role of protecting Roy Mustang.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Adventures in the East</h3><p> </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Marksmanship</h3><p>Riza Hawkeye is one of the most remarkable sharpshooters in the nation of Amestris. She has remarkable skill with all forms of firearms. From handguns, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Primary weapons are a pair of semi-automatic pistols she keeps in her rear uniform holster.</p><h2>Weapons &amp; Equipment</h2><p>Riza keeps a variety of firearms with her, and she adapts her arsenal to the requirements of any mission.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Anime</h3><p><strong>Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)</strong></p><p>The Fullmetal Alchemist series is the first anime adaptation of Hiromu Arakawa's original manga. It's produced by BONES and first began airing in October 4, 2003. It lasted for fifty-one episodes, and ended in October 2004. The series first began by following much of the original manga story, but would often change events of the continuity. It would eventually diverse from canon to tell its own story. This is partly due to the fact that while the manga was published monthly, the anime was being aired weekly.</p><p>Riza's first anime appearance is in <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i> - Episode 5 <i>\"The Man With the Mechanical Arm\"</i>, which aired on November 4, 2003. Her character in the Japanese series is voiced by Michiko Neya, and the U.S. dub produced by FUNimation is done by Colleen Clinkenbeard.</p><h4>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (2009)</h4><p>The <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</em> animated series is the second anime adaptation of Hiromu Arakawa's original manga. However, the series was only known in Japan as simply <em>Fullmetal Alchemist (</em>鋼 の錬金術師, Hagane no Renkinjutsushi). The \"Brotherhood\" subtitle was only added on for the Western audience to better differentiate it from the first 2003 series. <i>FMA: Brotherhood</i> was designed from its inception to be the true animated adaption of Arakawa's work. It was even set to end only a month after the final chapter of the manga was originally released in June 2010. It's produced by BONES and first began airing in April 5, 2009.</p><p>Riza's first appearance in this series was in in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood - Episode 1 \"<i>The Fullmetal Alchemist</i>\". Her character in the Japanese series is voiced by Fumiko Orikasa, and the U.S. dub produced by FUNimation is done by Colleen Clinkenbeard.</p><h3>Films</h3><h3>Games</h3>",

    "description": "<p>RC-1207 (otherwise known as Sev or Delta 07) is a member of Delta squad. He was the squads sniper and was known for his brutality in the clone wars. Sev was trained by Sgt. Walon Vau. He was one of the first to be deployed to Geonisis along with his squad. <br/>  <br/></p><h3>Geonosis</h3> <br/>His first objective was to eliminate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52921\" href=\"/sun-fac/4005-52921/\" slug=\"sun-fac\">Sun Fac </a>a Geonosian lieutenant. Sev was the first to reach the rendezvous point before his squad did. When Sun Fac tried to escape by a starfighter Sev used his sniping skills to destroy the ship killing Sun Fac. Then him and Delta Squad had to go to the catacombs and destroy a droid manufacturing base. They went threw some problems but got the job done. After that Sev and the rest of Delta Squad went into a Geonosian core ship, split up, sabotaging the ship, stole the launch codes, and escaped before the ship blew up.  <br/> <br/><h3>The Prosecutor</h3> <br/>367 days later Sev and his squad were put on a mission to investigate the Prosecutor a assault ship that had disappeared and suddenly returned. Sev and his squad split up to search the ship in different sections. While gathering information Sev was captured by Trandoshans and was interrogated until Boss and Fixer came to save him. Then him and Delta Squad had to defend the ship against Trandoshans and droids. In the end Sev and his squad stopped the droids and Trandoshans by sealing up the entrances giving them enough time for reinforcements to come. <br/> <br/><h3>Rescue of Omega Squad  <br/> </h3>After the mission on The Prosecutor Sev and Delta Squad were given a mission to go to the Kelarea system and help Omega squad who were trapped in a damaged freighter. Sev and Delta got in and saved Omega.  <br/> <br/><h3>Kashyyyk  <br/></h3>Sev and Delta's mission was to go to Kashyyyk and save Tarfful from the sepratists. So Sev and Delta fought through droids, trandoshans, and even magna guards. After they saved Tarfful a giant seperatist ship was flying over Kashyyyk. So Sev and Delta squad split up in individual turrets and shot down the ship. After that Sev lost radio contact and Delta was forced to leave him. Walon Vau tried to look for Sev but can only say he's MIA.  <br/>  <br/><strong>Personality</strong> <p>Though he inwardly struggled with the concept of living up to Walon Vau, he was outwardly a tough, aggressive individual, usually showing no emotion in his voice; often showing psychopathic tendencies. Although Scorch had the reputation as Delta Squad's comedian, Sev had a grim and sadistic sense of humor, which was more often than not the counterpart to Scorch's jokes. His obsession with counting kills was not groundless; he was set on getting 4,982 kills, one for every commando killed at the Battle of Geonosis. Sev was Delta Squad's  sniper– and was at his best when sighting an enemy in the scope of his DC-17 Sniper Rifle. Like his fellow clone commandos, Sev wore the distinctive Katarn armor, but his suit also had grim, blood-red streaks painted across it. His squad mates, however, sometimes wondered if these disturbing markings were actually paint at all. Regardless of how Sev developed his unique personality, it was generally agreed that he was a supremely efficient fighter.Scorch often joked that his cloning tank had been \"spiked\" which was resulting in his sadistic behavior.    </p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a> <h2>History</h2> <a href=\"///\"> <h3>Origin</h3>Born in the Isle Of Besaid. Growing up to be a professional Blitz player. Taught the teachings of Yevon. 23 years old, 6\"2\".     </a>   <br/><h3>Final Fantasy X </h3>Wakka appeared after Tidus washed up on shore after the encounter with Sin on the Al-Bhed ship where he met Rikku. Wakka threw a Blitzball at Tidus and asked him if he is alright. Tidus amazes Wakka and the others with his skills of Blitzball as Tidus was swimming to shore. When Tidus got to shore he introduced his self and Wakka decided to take him to the village to get something to eat. Tidus felt that he could trust Wakka so he asked Wakka whether or not Zanarknad was destroyed 1,000 years ago. Wakka replies and answers yes. The 2 then walk to Besaid but they end up on a cliff that overlooks a water fall. <p>Wakka then pushed Tidus into the water and he jumped in after him. They then swam and battled a few fiends. Minutes later Wakka headlocks Tidus and asks him to be a member of his team. Tidus accepts and they swim until they get to land. Now with the village in sight they walk all the way down. When they get there Wakka tells Tidus to go to the Crusader’s Tent and to go present his self to the temple summoner. Wakka then showed Tidus how to do the prayer. Tidus does both of his tasks and comes back to Wakka’s house. Wakka offered Tidus a bed since the food wasn’t ready yet. Tidus gladly accepts and he goes to sleep.</p> <p>A temple monk comes in and talks to Wakka about how Yuna and her guardians haven’t come out of the Chamber of the Fayth in a day while Tidus was asleep. Wakka leaves and goes to the temple and Tidus follows after he wakes up. When Tidus arrives and wonders what has happened Wakka starts to explain to Tidus what’s going on. Wakka says that the summoner hasn’t come out in a day. Tidus enraged then runs inside the Chamber of the Fayth without thinking.</p> <p>After Tidus solved the puzzle Wakka comes in and wonders what the heck Tidus was thinking for just barging in. He then explains that there are 2 people below them. 1 of them gets mad easy and who knows what the other’s thinking. They then take the elevator down and the 2 people they meet are less then eager to meet them. One of them walks up to Wakka and wonders why he’s down there. When Tidus speaks though she wonders who he was.</p> <p>When she stopped speaking though the door to the Chamber of the Fayth opened and Yuna emerged from there. She had sweat trickling down her face when she came out. She almost fell down but the other person who was there managed to grab her and help her up. All of them leave the chamber and they go to the temple above them so they can exit to go outside. Once outside Wakka tells Tidus to come over to where he is so he can see Yuna’s first Aeon.</p> <p>Later that night Wakka introduced Tidus to the rest of the team. During that night Wakka introduced the new goal to the rest of the team. When he said what’s our goal and the team responded with the old goal he introduced to them the new goal of victory. For a few seconds the team looked surprised that their new goal was victory but then they got cheerful that for once they were going to try to win. After Tidus spoke with Yuna Wakka offered him a bed and he accepted. </p> <p>When everyone was asleep Wakka was talking to Lulu about Tidus and why he shouldn’t of brought him there. Wakka started to say that he needed there help but Lulu wouldn’t hear of it. She was just tired of hearing Wakka’s excuses. When Wakka went to the Crusader’s Tent he found Tidus up and Tidus wondered who’s Chappu since that name was said in the conversation. Wakka said that Chappu was his younger brother and he died when Sin attacked the year before.</p> <p>Wakka also said that he heard on the first day of the tournament and that’s why he couldn’t focus because Chappu’s death was on his mind. Wakka and Tidus continue their conversation and eventually go to sleep. The next morning when Wakka was with Lulu talking Tidus comes out and Wakka presents him with a new sword. Lulu interupts and says that that was Chappu’s sword. Wakka said that he never used it. The trio then waits for Yuna and they go to the boat. While they were walking though Kimahri attacked Tidus.</p> <p>After the fight everyone explains to Tidus who Kimahri is. The 4 of them then walk to the boat and they get on so they can go to Kilika so Yuna can pray at the temple and so the Aurochs can pray for their victory.</p> <p>On the way they are attacked by Sin but manage to get away. They arrive at Luca and Wakka gives his gratitude to the new maester, Maester Seymour. When the game is about to begin Yuna ask Tidus to come see something. Wakka wants them to hurry up because the game starts soon. Yuna is kidnapped by the Al-Bhed. Tidus, Kimihari, and Lulu go to fight the Al-Bhed to return Yuna.</p> <p>The game begins and Tidus is gone so they play without him. Wakka and the team wins the first first match against the Al-Bheds, and the team wins. After Yuna is rescued Tidus comes back for the game against the the champions. In the last quarter the crowd chants on Wakka's name. Tidus goes back and tells Wakka to play, so he does. After the game they meet Sir Auron. Sin comes to attack Luca, Sin's spawn comes to attack them, they beat it. Maester Seymour summons his Aeon named Anima and fights as well. Sin leaves and the city is damaged. Sir Auron then becomes a guardian and Wakka is flattered for the honor.</p> <p>The team goes to Mi'iHen Highroad, then Mushroom Rock Road, then Djose Highroad, then The Moon Flow. Battling fiends and getting stronger. At the Moon Flow the team rides a Shoopuff and Yuna is kidnapped by the Al-Bhed again. Wakka and Tidus jump into the water to rescue her from the Al-Bhed machina. </p> <p>They arrive at shore and Tidus finds Rikku laying on the shore. Yunagets up takes off her Al-Bhed suit and tells Tidus that she was the one who kidnapped Yuna. Wakka and the gang comes up, Yuna ask Rikku to join the team as an Guardian, she agrees. Wakka is angry that she let someone become an guardian when she doesn't even know her.</p> <p>Together they now travel too Guadosalam, then the Thunder plains. battling fiends and getting stronger and better. Until they get to the Macalania Lake. Where after Wakka and the gang defeat the Al-Bhed again, Rikku is speaking Al-Bhed and tells her Al-Bhed brother that she is an guardian. Wakka is questioning Rikku of why is she speaking Al-Bhed, she tells him that she is Al-Bhed, also everyone knew about it. Wakka is angry why an Al-Bhed is a guardian, Wakka and Rikku have an argument on how Al-Bhed machina created Sin and went against the teachings of Yevon. Rikku argues back on how that is not true.</p> <p>Yuna leaves to go marry Maester Seymour and the gang goes to Maester Seymour in Macalenia Lake. Wakka and the gang figures out how Maester Seymour killed Lord Jyscal and Wakka is in denial and can't believe that it's true, until they fight Maester Seymour and kill him, now they are wanted criminals. They are chased down fought and they come up on a powerful fiend who fights them.  <br/> <br/></p> <a href=\"///\"> <h3>Underneath Macalania</h3>After fighting the fiend, Wakka and the others fall through the ice. They soon come across Sin, who is listening to the Hymn of the Fayth.</a>   <br/><a href=\"///\"> <h3>Kingdom Hearts </h3>In Kingdom Hearts, Wakka is younger just like Tidus. And he still has his love for Blitz Ball. He fights battles with a ball.  <br/><br/></a><h2>Powers/Abilities</h2> <p>Wakka is specialized in flying fiends. His weapon is a blitzball.

After the conflict between his father and grandfather over what to do with Puny Earthlings, Thorgal was cast down onto the Earth in a water-proof capsule and found by the Vikings. He became a foster son of the Viking chief Leif Haraldsson, but never felt fully a Viking. He is the husband of Aaricia and father of Jolan, Louve and Aniel. Has always had a love-hate relationship with gods.</p>",

Yugi see's his deck and gives him Wingd Kuribo card for his deck. The card that was given to him came in handy for the entrance exam's when he dueled Vellian Crowler, an instructor from Duel Academy, to get in. Jaden beats Crowler but was placed in the Slifer Red Dorm, the lowest dorm at Duel Academy. While at the entrance exam he met Syrus Truesdale how was also placed in the same dorm. When Jaden got to the academy he met Chumley Huffington a thrid year Slifer Red student. The school year started off slow but picked up after Jaden started dueling other students and making new friends like <a href=\"/alexis-rhodes/4005-52105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52105\">Alexis Rhodes</a> how at first did not want nothing to do with any one from Slifer Red because she was from the Obelisk Blue Girls' dorm. Other students Jaden encounters are Chazz Princeton - an Obelisk Blue Student, one of Jaden's most favored rivals and owner of various monster types (the famous Ojama trio, the VWXYZ machine monsters &amp; Armed Dragons); <a href=\"/zane-truesdale/4005-53382/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53382\">Zane Truesdale</a> - an Obelisk Blue Student, Syrus' older brother, duelist progeny and owner of the Cyber Dragons; Bastion Misawa - a Ra Yellow Student.</p><p>Jaden's deck mostly contain superhero themed characters called Elemental Heroes, and later he receives alien themed characters called Neo-Spacians after a young duelist named Aster Phoenix beats him in a duel, and loses the sight of his cards. He leaves Duel Academy, but then he finds these new monsters contacting him called \"Neo-spacians\" are going to give him a new deck with new cards to defeat The Light.</p><h2>Deck</h2><h3>Monsters:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2208754\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208754-elementalheroes.png\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"544\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 544px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208754-elementalheroes.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2208754\"><img alt=\"The Elemental Heroes\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208754-elementalheroes.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208754-elementalheroes.png 544w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>The Elemental Heroes</figcaption></figure><p>Elemental Heroes:</p><ul><li>Elemental Hero Sparkman</li><li>Elemental Hero Wildheart</li><li>Elemental Hero Burstinatrix</li><li>Elemental Hero Avian</li><li>Elemental Hero Bubbleman</li><li>Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman</li><li>Elemental Hero Clayman</li><li>Elemental Hero Bladedge</li><li>Elemental Hero Necroshade</li><li>Elemental Hero Wildedge (Fusion of Wildheart and Bladedge)</li><li>Elemental Hero Flame Wingman (Fusion of Avian and Burstinatrix)</li><li>Elemental Hero Darkbright (Fusion of Sparkman and Necroshade)</li><li>Elemental Hero Mudball Man (Fusion of Clayman and Bubbleman)</li><li>Elemental Hero Necro Shamen (Fusion of Wildheart and Necroshade)</li><li>Elemental Hero Shining Wingman(Fusion of Sparkman and Flame Wingman)</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2208756\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208756-neospacians.png\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"544\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 544px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208756-neospacians.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2208756\"><img alt=\"The Neo-Spacians\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208756-neospacians.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208756-neospacians.png 544w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Neo-Spacians\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208756-neospacians.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/2208756-neospacians.png 544w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Neo-Spacians</figcaption></figure><p>Neo-Spacians (Jaden designed them, along with Elemental Hero Neos &amp;

    "description": "<h2> Birth, Early Life and Heliopolis</h2><p>The boy named Kira was to be born to Via Hibiki, in the 55th year of the Cosmic Era, along with his twin sister, Cagalli. In order to test a new type of artificial womb, the twin's father, Ulen, extracted Kira in utero and continued to gestate him in the artificial womb, which, while horrifying Via, successfully created a perfect coordinator in Kira. Following the tragic death of their parents in a murder plot by Rau La Flaga, Kira was adopted by the Yamato family. His sister, Cagalli, was adopted by Orb Representative Uzumi Nara Athha and returned to the Orb Union on Earth.  </p>  <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223777-ky_birdy.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223777\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223777-ky_birdy.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223777\"><img alt=\" Birdy\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223777-ky_birdy.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223777-ky_birdy.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption> Birdy</figcaption></figure> While enjoying his peaceful childhood, Kira met and befriended another child, named Athrun Zala, who turned out to be a fellow coordinator. However, Athrun was forced to leave Heliopolis for the ZAFT controlled PLANTS, and so the two were separated. Nevertheless, before leaving, Athrun built Kira an automaton bird, appropriately named \"Birdy\" as a farewell gift.   <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223765-kira_yamato_age_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223765\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223765-kira_yamato_age_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223765\"><img alt=\" Kira - Aged 13\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223765-kira_yamato_age_13.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223765-kira_yamato_age_13.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Kira - Aged 13</figcaption></figure>  <br/> Years later, Kira lived on on Heliopolis, a neutral colony that had severed ties with both the Earth Forces and the ZAFT, with his friends Miriallia Haw, , Tolle Koenig, Kuzzey Buskirk,  Sai Argyle and, his girlfriend, Flay Allster. At this time, though being good friends with Sai, Kira harboured a secret crush on the good-natured Flay. <br/><p>   </p>  In C.E (Cosmic Era) 71, the colony of Heliopolis was attacked by the ZAFT forces, and Kira and his friends were forced to find shelters to avoid the bloodshed. While evacuating, Kira caught site of an enigmatic young woman, whom he decided to follow, concerned that she may endanger herself.  The two eventually encountered two Earth Alliance Mobile Suits in production, the GAT X-105 Strike and the GAT-X303 Aegis. The young woman entered a hysterical state, collapsing to the ground and cursing her father for building Alliance war machines in a supposedly neutral nation like Heliopolis. Kira assisted the still-in-shock woman to a safety shelter, and after making sure she was safe, quickly searched for another for himself.   <br/>  <br/> During his search, Kira came across a skirmish between a ZAFT soldier and an Earth Alliance female officer. Kira warned the officer of an impending attack by another ZAFT soldier, saving the woman's life, who, after assisting her, revealed herself to be Officer Murrue Ramius. The approaching ZAFT soldier threw Kira into a state of disarray, as he recognised his childhood friend, Athrun Zala, as one of Heliopolis' attackers. Amidst Kira and Athrun's mutual confusion and shock, Ramius attempted to shoot Zala, however she was unsuccessful and Athrun managed to acquire the Aegis and flee. Ramius took Kira with her as she attempted to pursue the Aegis in the Strike. <br/>    <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223811-ky_strike_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223811\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223811-ky_strike_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223811\"><img alt=\" The Strike Battling the GINN\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223811-ky_strike_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223811-ky_strike_2.jpg 640w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223811-ky_strike_2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\" The Strike Battling the GINN\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223811-ky_strike_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223811-ky_strike_2.jpg 640w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223811-ky_strike_2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The Strike Battling the GINN</figcaption></figure> While pursuing Athrun and the Aegis, Kira, Murrue and the Strike were interrupted by a ZAFT Mobile Suit, specifically the ZGMF-1017 GINN, piloted by Miguel Aiman. Murrue attempted to pilot the Strike, but as she had no formal training, the Strike's OS was incomplete, and she was a Natural, her efforts were in vain. After witnessing his friends, and realising they too were in danger, however, Kira seized control of the Strike, reconfigured its Operating System and began to attack Miguel's Ginn. The Ginn, greatly outclassed by the vastly superior Strike Gundam and its Phase-Shift Armor, was forced to retreat. <br/>   <br/> Following the combat, Ramius informed Kira that he and his friends were now privy to an Earth Alliance military secret, that the Alliance had commissioned Heliopolis to develop Mobile Suits for them to combat the ZAFT's superior firepower. In exchange for not killing them, Murrue offered the students a place in her unit, where they would be forced to follow her command, lest they be killed. Kira's role being to pilot the Strike, as Murrue had discerned his identity as a Coordinator, and consequently the only one present capable of using the Mobile Suit. Kira initially refused, but after Mu La Flaga, a member of Ramius' team, reminded Yamato that he was the only one capable of protecting not only his friends, but all of the crew of the Archangel battle ship, Kira agreed. <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223778-ky_strike_destroys_ginn.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223778\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55542168674699\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223778-ky_strike_destroys_ginn.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223778\"><img alt=\"      Kira Destroying the GINN and Killing Miguel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223778-ky_strike_destroys_ginn.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223778-ky_strike_destroys_ginn.png 830w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223778-ky_strike_destroys_ginn.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"      Kira Destroying the GINN and Killing Miguel\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223778-ky_strike_destroys_ginn.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223778-ky_strike_destroys_ginn.png 830w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223778-ky_strike_destroys_ginn.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>      Kira Destroying the GINN and Killing Miguel</figcaption></figure>  <br/><h2>Aboard the Archangel, and Joining the Earth Forces </h2>Eventually, Kira is forced to battle his friend Athrun Zala again, this time outside of Orb Territory. Surprised by the ZAFT forces, the Archangel was forced to take the defensive, and a determined Kira knew that perhaps the only way to save his friends aboard the Archangel would be to kill his friend aboard the Aegis. After taking the Duel and the Buster out of the battle, Kira confronted and defeated Athrun's Aegis. Standing above his fallen friend, Kira was then attacked from the side by Nicol Amalthi, who using the Blitz' signature cloaking system, had managed to sneak up on Kira's Strike. However, the Blitz had sustained significant damaged from earlier in the battle, with Kira having severed its arm off. Nevertheless, Nicol attacked, and Kira, in instinctively parried the blow and struck back. However, this action would result in Nicol's death, as the Strike slashed through the Blitz with its sword, obliterating the Mobile Suit completely. <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223796-ky_na_death.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223796\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223796-ky_na_death.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223796\"><img alt=\" Kira Kills Nicol\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223796-ky_na_death.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223796-ky_na_death.jpg 720w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223796-ky_na_death.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Kira Kills Nicol\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223796-ky_na_death.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223796-ky_na_death.jpg 720w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223796-ky_na_death.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Kira Kills Nicol</figcaption></figure><h2>Skills and Abilities</h2> Despite possessing no formal training, Kira proved himself an exceptionally skilled Mobile Suit pilot, managing to not only defend the crew of the Archangel spacecraft, but also besting many trained Mobile Suit pilots in personal combat, after only using the Gundam for a few minutes. After gaining some experience with the Suit, Kira's prowess only shone further. Despite being armed with only a single Skygrasper for support, Kira was able to battle and defeat, on numerous occasions, the ZAFT Forces, who were using the other four advanced Gundams at the time.  <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223797-ky_strike.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223797\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223797-ky_strike.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223797\"><img alt=\" The Strike AILE, in Action\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223797-ky_strike.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223797-ky_strike.jpg 600w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223797-ky_strike.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\" The Strike AILE, in Action\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223797-ky_strike.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223797-ky_strike.jpg 600w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223797-ky_strike.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The Strike AILE, in Action</figcaption></figure> Kira's piloting ability extended beyond the obvious as well, as he was capable of using the GAT-X105 Strike to not only battle, but decimate, multiple Bakus led by the military genius, Andrew Waltfeld, while in the desert. This was an incredible effort as Kira was able to modify the Gundam's Operating System while simultaneously battling the enemy. His Strike Gundam was specifically designed for space combat, and was never meant to be used on land, particularly not on a shifting landscape like the desert possesses. Kira's ability to compensate for this issue, as well as being able to optimise the performance of his machine, in mid-combat, showed an incredible intuitiveness that was perhaps unrivalled by any other Coordinator.  <br/>  <br/> Kira's skills with computer programming, particularly Mobile Suit's Operating Systems, was not a one-off occurrence however, as he was able to spontaneously modify the existing OS of the Strike after being thrust into it only moments after its activation. Despite having no formal training in Mobile Suit technology, or even any experience with military crafty, Kira was able to perfectly adapt the unit's OS for the situation. Once again, Kira accomplished this in the middle of a skirmish, as well as great emotional conflict, as he had just seen his childhood friend infiltrating his homeland.    <br/>  <br/> Kira's improvisational and adaptive skills were again put on display while the Archangel was on Earth. Despite the Strike not being able to use sustained flight inside an atmosphere, Kira was again able to best the Le Creuset team's Gundams on multiple, while they used special flight platforms. He eventually succeeded in destroying the GAT-X207 Blitz, as piloted by Nicol Amalfi, while simultaneously battling the GAT-X303 Aegis as piloted by his friend, Athrun Zala.  <br/>  <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223792-ky_seed.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223792\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.752\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223792-ky_seed.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223792\"><img alt=\" Kira in SEED Mode\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223792-ky_seed.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223792-ky_seed.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Kira in SEED Mode\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223792-ky_seed.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223792-ky_seed.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Kira in SEED Mode</figcaption></figure> Being a Coordinator, Kira possesses heightened physical and mental capabilities far beyond that of any human. His reflex are sufficient to react to a moments-earlier invisible Blitz trying to pierce his Strike with a spear, and to modify the arc of his blade when battling Yzak Joule in his GAT-102 Duel, in order to spare the pilot's life. Kira was able to subdue an enraged Sai with one hand, despite the latter having a larger and more developedphysique.  <br/> In addition to his standard Coordinator physiology, Kira is able to enter \"SEED Mode\". The \"SEED Mode\", short for <b>S</b> uper <b>E</b> volutionary <b>E</b> lement <b>D</b> estined-Factor,  is an ability that can be attained by both Naturals and Coordinators. While in SEED Mode, the user gains enhanced awareness and peak physical abilities, greatly increasing their fighting ability. While in SEED Mode, Yamato was able to defeat Andrew Waltfeld in his modified Baku with only the basic Strike Unit, Combat Knife and no Phase-Shift Armor, meaning that a single attack could have destroyed the Gundam. <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223791-ky_seed_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223791\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223791-ky_seed_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223791\"><img alt=\" SEED Mode Activating\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" data-width=\"384\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223791-ky_seed_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223791-ky_seed_2.jpg 384w\"><noscript><img alt=\" SEED Mode Activating\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223791-ky_seed_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223791-ky_seed_2.jpg 384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" data-width=\"384\"></noscript></a><figcaption> SEED Mode Activating</figcaption></figure>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/>  <br/><br/><p>  Kira Yamato was not a gundam pilot at first he has was a college student in a space colony called Helieopolis with his friends. That all chaneged when Helieopolis was attacked by ZAFT forces. In the attack Kira would find two prototype mobile suits the GAT-X105 Strike and the GAT-X303 Aegis they were two out of five mobile suits the others being GAT-X102 Duel, GAT-X207 Blitz, and GAT-X103 Buster. When finding the two mobile suits Kira runs in to his childhood Athrun Zala how is now in the ZAFT forces. Both Kira and Athrun are both shocked to see each other. But thing were getting out of hand both of them got into a GUNDAM. Kira got in the Strike and Athrun got into the Aegis. Soon after both Kira and Athrun became enemies.</p><p>After Heliopolis was destroyed Kira found him self on the ship Archangel with his firends and the ship now being under the comand of Murrue Ramius. On the Archangel Kira would meet Mu La Flaga and Natarle Bagiruel as well. Kira would fight to keep the ship safe and all the people on bord it. When the ship tryed let a ship of survivors go down to earth in a fight between the Earth Alliance and ZAFT the ship was destrode by the GAT-X102 Duel it being one of the mobile suits that ZAFT stole in the attack on Helieopolis. Kira tryed to stop it but was not able too. Soon after that Kira would go into SEED Mode when the Archangel became under attack by all three of the stolen mobile suits. SEED Mode made Kira be able to stop all three mobile suit and scaring the pilot of the GAT-X 102 Duel Yzak Joule. </p>  <br/><h2>In Other Media</h2>  Kira, along with his various Mobile Suits (the Strike, the Freedom and the ZGMF-X10A Strike Freedom) has appeared in multiple other forms of media, most notably the many Gundam Seed Manga spin-offs, including <i>Gundam Seed Astray,</i>  and the many video games based on the franchise. Kira Yamato and his Gundams have also appeared in spin-off games, such as the<i> Dynasty Warriors: Gundam </i> and <i>Super Robot Warriors</i>  franchises.  <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223818-ky_dw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223818\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56235294117647\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223818-ky_dw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2223818\"><img alt=\" The Strike in Dynasty Warriors: Gundam\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223818-ky_dw.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223818-ky_dw.jpg 850w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223818-ky_dw.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\" The Strike in Dynasty Warriors: Gundam\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223818-ky_dw.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/2223818-ky_dw.jpg 850w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/2223818-ky_dw.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The Strike in Dynasty Warriors: Gundam</figcaption></figure>",

    "description": "<p>Delta 62 (Scorch) is the Demolitions expert of Delta squad. He was nicknamed Scorch because of a demolition accident that blew off his eyebrows for a long period of time. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Geonosis</strong></p> <p>Scorch was one of the first to be deployed into Geonosis and the first to meet up with Boss. Scorchs main role on Geonosis was to do what he loves, to blow stuff up. After Sev killed Sun Fac, Scorch and Delta went into the catacombs and he destroyed the droids communications jammer and the droid manufacturing base. After that Scorch and Delta went to the core ship where they split up. Scorch fought his way through the droids and sabatoged the ship causing the ship to blow up. After that he reunited with Delta Squad and escaped the core ship with the launch codes.  <br/> <br/><strong>The Prosecutor </strong></p> <p>367 days later. Delta Squad was ordered to investigate the Prosecutor Delta Squads first home. So Scorch and Delta squad split up to search the whole ship. Unfortanatly Scorch was captured by Trandoshans and was put into a holding cell. After he was rescued by Delta Scorch helped Delta Squad by defending the ship against droids and Trandoshans. After they got the barriers to work, reinforcements came and Scorch and Delta left the ship.  <br/> <br/><strong>Kashyyyk </strong></p> <p>Scorch and Delta Squad were sent to Kassyyk for intelligence reasons. Scorch and Delta destroyed Trandoshan camps and saved Tarfful. After that a seperatist crusier came over Kashyyyk. So Delta split up and Scorch took a anti air turret and shot down the crusier. Scorch then reunited with his squad but Sev lost radio contact. Forced to leave, Scorch had to leave the area wishing he could go back for Sev.  <br/> <br/><strong>Birth of an empire </strong></p> <p>When the great jedi purge had begun, Scorch was an Imperial commando in service of the new order. He still replayed Sev's abandonment in his head endlessly, and deeply resented Boss, Fixer, and his commanders for leaving him behind, but forced himself to move on. From then on the comedic joker part of him died and was replaced with a more battle hardened and serious personality.      <br/> <br/><strong>Personality</strong></p> <p>Scorch was generally considered to be the most lighthearted Delta and loved poking fun and annoying his other squad mates. He had an over-developed sense of irony, and was the resident wise guy of Delta Squad, much to the annoyance of some of his peers. But the Clone Wars took its toll on everyone involved; after a rocket attack on the bases' mess hall, Scorch took out his pent up frustration and rage on the bodies of the local rebels who fired the rocket. It only got worse for Scorch. After the squad was ordered to abandon Sev on Kashyyyk, they pulled out against Scorch's pleas, causing him to lash out at Fixer when the Splicer tried to comfort him. Even going as far as saying that Delta squad would never leave a man behind. </p> <p>Scorch carried a large ordnance pack strapped to his back and sported yellow markings on his wrist gauntlets, making him easier to be identified by his squad-mates. Supposedly Scorch got his nickname after a training accident with some ordnance that left him without eyebrows for sometime.  </p>",

When in jail she was attacked by a machine that can take human frome and has been on a killing spree. The machine attacked Masane because of this and the Witchblade awakened and Masane became the new wielder and destoryed the machine with not even breaking a sweat.</p><p>After all that Masane would come to find her self working for the government to help them destroy the machines that escaped six years during the quake called exCons. Soon after that she would face off against two other Witchblade wielders that work for a huge corporation that is trying to over throw the government. In time Masane would come to defeat them but soon after the Witchblade starts to breaking down her body leading to her death which is seen in the. Rihoko would then become the new wielder of the Witchblade.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>The Witchblade</h3><p>Masane wielded the witchblade but used is differently than other hosts. She mostly used its abilities as a blade that grew from her arm or extending her hair in to blades. She never used it's abilities to create wings or gills to breath under water. She also gained a new form of the Witchblade which allow her in this form was increased her strength to new levels. But, because of this new form the Witchblade began to drain her life and evidently caused her death.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><p><b>Witchblade (Anime)</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/141363-144634-witchblade.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-141363\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.385\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/141363-144634-witchblade.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-141363\"><img alt=\"Masane Amaha\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/141363-144634-witchblade.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/141363-144634-witchblade.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Masane Amaha</figcaption></figure><p>The Witchblade anime was co-produced by the Japanese company GONZO and the American comic book company, Top Cow. The anime was not an exact adaption of the Witchblade comic book. However, it is connected to the expanded universe of the Witchblade. The setting of the anime is set in the far future, long after Sara Pezzini was the wielder of the Witchblade. The story follows a Japanese woman named Masane Amaha. She was discovered inside ground zero (A phenomenal disaster) unharmed. Masane unknowingly, had the Witchlade on her wrist after this incident. She was also holding a baby in her arms and had lost all her memory. Six years later, Masane and the baby (Rihoko) returned to Tokyo. They would walk around Tokyo sight seeing for awhile, Masane told Rihoko that if she got lost they would meet each other under the Tokyo Tower.However, when they are having lunch they are confronted by NSWF's Child Welfare Division. The Child Welfare wanted to take Rihoko away from Masane because she was not really her mother, and also because she had no job to support her. Masane would try to take her child back but would end up getting arrested and sent to jail.</p><p>She would then be attacked in jail by a mysterious monster. Luckily for Masane, the Witchblade activated as a reaction to her danger. Masane easily disposed of that monster and escaped from jail right afterwards. However, using the Witchblade used up all her stamina and she collapsed in an ally. Masane would be taken in by a man working for the Douji Group Industries. When Masane awakens, she is met by Hiroki Segawa, the same man who took her in after she passed out. Hiroki takes Masane to his boss, Reiji Takayama. He tells Masane about the Witchblade and its powers, and tells her that it belonged to them. Meaning, since she cannot just take it off, she has to work for them now. Masane continued to decline until Reiji offered her a nice life with her daughter. Masane then agreed, and Reiji briefs her in about hunting the \"Ex-Cons.\" Ex-Cons are monsters that feed on people, and it was the same thing that attacked Masane at the jail. The Witchblade acts differently with Masane when compared to the original American wielders; when activated the Witchblade gives Masane not only a different hair color and style but also an ecstasy-like rush that heightens when she fights.</p><h3>Collectibles</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/2906943-1361653752205.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2906943\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75474083438685\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/2906943-1361653752205.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2906943\"><img alt=\"Masane in casual clothes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34101/2906943-1361653752205.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/2906943-1361653752205.jpg 791w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34101/2906943-1361653752205.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Masane in casual clothes\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34101/2906943-1361653752205.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/2906943-1361653752205.jpg 791w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34101/2906943-1361653752205.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Masane in casual clothes</figcaption></figure><p>The Witchblade anime has also spawned several painted PVC figurines as is common in Japan.

    "deck": "Leader of Republic Commando Delta Sqaud",
    "description": "<h2>Origin<br/></h2>Boss started off exactly the same as his commando brethren. As his training progressed, he consistently ranked highest in his squad for accuracy and all-around fighting ability. He even managed to break Sergeant Walon Vau's arm in training. It was because of these qualities that Vau appointed him as the leader of Delta Squad.      <br/> <h3>Geonosis</h3> <p>Boss took command of Delta Squad in the opening stages of the Battle of Geonosis. The group was flown in separately in gunships where Boss immediately set about turning a platoon of droids into scrap metal. Boss met up with his demolitions expert <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52080\" href=\"/rc-1262/4005-52080/\" slug=\"rc-1262\">  Scorch</a> and the two set about rendezvousing with Fixer and then Sev. <br/><br/>During the closing hours of the battle, the squad was instrumental in ensuring victory for the Republic by eliminating Geonosian lieutenant Sun Fac, destroying an underground jamming device and disabling a droid factory. </p> <p>After the squad disabled the underground droid factory, the commandos were instructed to retrieve the launch codes from a disabled Confederate Core Ship and to destroy it. On their way to the core ship, the Deltas destroyed an anti aircraft bunker. The squad continued their advancement toward the core ship. </p> <p> <br/>Once inside, the squad split up so they could disable certain functions, with Boss tasked with infiltrating the super battle droid storage racks and disabling most of the stored battle droids. He then continued to rendezvous with the squad so they could retrieve the core ship's launch codes. As they progressed, the ship was sustaining massive damage due to the squad's actions, and was on the verge of destruction. The squad barely managed to retrieve the codes and escape through an LAAT/i. The success of the Deltas was later noticed by an important individual.     <strong>  <br/></strong></p><h3>The Prosecutor<br/></h3><p>After victory was assured on Geonosis, the Deltas were deployed across the galaxy. Boss and his commandos became veterans of many engagements. Midway through the war, Delta Squad was tasked with investigating the assault ship prosecutor, the squad's first base of operations, which had reappeared in the Chaykin Cluster after vanishing while defending Republic trade routes near Corellia two weeks prior. </p> <p>The squad entered separate parts of the ship, each having been tasked with retrieving the flight data from the ship's data cores. Boss entered through the torpedo bay tasked with retrieving the flight recorder data from the aft data core. While on his way, Scorch was ambushed by scavenger droids and incapacitated. Boss also encountered significant amounts of these droids after witnessing one kill a surviving clone trooper. </p> <p>Boss encountered several Trandoshans and realized that a small army of them were responsible for the taking of the ship. He managed to get to an overlook position where he could maintain a visual on Sev, who was slicing the datacore's access terminal. After retrieving some of the data, he was ambushed by a scavenger droid, which he destroyed, but was incapacitated by a Trandoshan slaver. Shortly afterward, Boss fell under attack by the Trandoshans, but managed to escape. <br/><br/>Boss retrieved the data from the aft data core, and finished slicing the data from the port core, hoping to gain insight as to how the Trandoshans had managed to take over the ship. Afterward he fought his way to the rendezvous point where he was to meet Fixer. After killing a Trandoshan elite he came to the rendezvous point and was surprised by the site of a battle droid dispenser at the meeting place. After joining with Fixer, the two commandos rescued Sev, who had resisted interrogation. The three then proceed to the detention block to rescue Scorch, who had sliced the core and managed to hide it from the interrogators. <br/><br/>The commandos fought their way to the bridge and destroyed a jamming device that prevented them from communicating with their advisor. The advisor revealed that the Trandoshans planned on selling the ship to the Trade Federation so they could buy battle droids to help them capture Wookiees for the slave trade. He instructed them to destroy the Trandoshan dropship in hangar A, which they managed using Trandoshan rocket turrets. Afterward, a Droid Control Ship arrived, intending to purchase the ship from the now-dead Trandoshans. The squad was forced to fight off droid boarders and disable the hangar force field regulators in the remaining hangars. <br/><br/>Now unable to capture the <i>Prosecutor</i>, the Droid Control Ship opened fire. While the adviser scanned the system for any Republic assistance, Delta Squad fought their way to one of the gunnery stations to return fire. With the help of the Arrestor, the Deltas were able to repel the boarders and destroy the droid control ship.    <br/></p><h3>Kashyyyk</h3> <p>In the final stages of the war, Boss led the Deltas into combat on Kashyyyk, first to rescue the Wookiee commander Tarfful and escort him back to the Wookie. After landing via LAAT/i, the squad proceeded to a Trandoshan prison compound, where the Trandoshans held Tarfful, as well as numerous other Wookiees. The squad infiltrated the compound after killing the patrols and guards outside, but were ambushed and forced to flee further into the compound. The squad found Tarfful, with the help of some captured Wookiees, but General Grievous was interrogating him at the time. Grievous fled after being spotted, but left two IG-100 Magna Guards to kill Tarfful and the Deltas. Delta-38 and his squad destroyed the droids while ensuring the survival of Tarfful. After the rescue, Boss received orders to sabotage the compound. The squad destroyed the landing pad on an upper level, destroying a Trandoshan dropship in the process, rappelling to the lower levels and destroying another landing pad before they were extracted. <br/><br/>Their transport brought the squad to Kachirho where the Separatist army was making its primary advance. Boss and his squad had to detonate the bridge on which the Separatists were making their advance by placing a charge on the central span of expansion joints, thus causing it to collapse. The squad fought its way to the bridge and planted the charge. The detonation of the charge failed, however, and with no charges that could detonate the bridge the squad instead relied on a Wookiee rocket launcher, which they used to destroy the fuel pipeline beneath the bridge. Afterwards they rendezvoused with Tarfful and secured vital munitions for the Wookiee defense. While securing the munitions, the squad fell under the fire of a joint force of droids, Trandoshans, and Geonosians, but defeated this opposition. <br/><br/>Afterwards, Tarfful instructed an elite bodyguard of his to escort the squad to an elevator that would take them to the level where they could man four rocket turrets and cause intense damage to a Separatist cruiser that was attempting to land on the tree they were in. Unfortunately, the escort died almost instantly due to enemy firing, so Boss and the squad had to get there on their own. When the Separatist cruiser started drawing too much power from the cities main power generators, preventing the cities defenses from firing, the squad was forced to activate backup generators. After their ascent to the upper levels, they proceeded to four rocket turrets, leaving one member of the squad to man each one. With the combined firepower of each turret, they demolished the Cruiser, and attempted to regroup at 38's position. Unfortunately, Sev, the squad's marksman, didn't make it to 38's position, and went missing in action. Only a direct order from Master Yoda convinced him to leave without Sev. Despite the loss of their comrade, the Deltas boarded a gunship and were sent back into combat.   <strong><br/></strong></p><h3>Personality</h3> <p>As leader of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47054\" href=\"/republic-commandos/4060-47054/\" slug=\"republic-commandos\">  Republic Commando</a> Delta Squadron RC-1138 AKA \"Boss\" leads his team with a quiet but strong presence. Of his brigade of clones Boss is perhaps the most clone-like, where as the others of Delta Squad seem to have become very unique in their personalities, Boss seems very rigid and military orientated no matter the situation, suggesting he has pursued very little in the way of a personal life outside his duties in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-52264\" href=\"/clone-army/4060-52264/\" slug=\"clone-army\">  Clone Army</a>.</p>",

    "deck": "Delta Sqauds resident Tech Expert. Tends to be anti-social in his off-duty hours, preferring the company of his droid.",
    "description": "<p>RC-1140 also known as Delta 40 or Fixer was Delta squads splicer who could hack any system. </p> <p> <br/><strong>Geonosis </strong></p>Delta Squad was originally deployed on Geonosis, along with most clone troopers in service during the war. Due to complications, the commandos had to be dropped separately. Fixer rendezvoused with Boss and Scorch in a fighter hangar, and when the other commandos needed silent entry or a force field disabling, Fixer always managed to bypass Geonosian security codes and quickly gained a reputation as a miracle technician. After eliminating their first target, the Geonosian Sun Fac, the squad advisor reassigned the squad to eliminate a droid factory underneath the arena, which Theta Squad had attempted to breach without success. Fixer was called upon to disable a shield protecting a Jamming Device so that Scorch could plant a charge. Eventually, the squad disabled the factory, and were airlifted to a new objective. Unfortunately, they met heavy resistance, not least from dwarf spider droid. After disabling an AA turret, the squad was ordered to disable a Core Ship and retrieve the launch codes to halt the Sepratist evacuation. When Delta Squad fought their way in they split up to sabatoge the ship in different areas so the ship would be destroyed. After that Fixer reunited with Delta squad and Fixer downloaded the launch codes and escaped.  <br/> <br/><strong>The Prosecutor  <br/></strong>367 days into the Clone Wars, Delta Squad was deployed to their first home during service, an Acclamator-class Assault ship called the <i>Prosecutor</i>. The ship was infested with mynocks, and several scavenger droids had managed to enter. Fixer had left his squadmates for a faster mission completion; however, Sev and Scorch were incapacitated by Trandoshans. Boss had witnessed Sev being incapacitated, but due to a comm's failure, Fixer did not find out, so carried out his mission as planned. However, he found out in time that two squadmates were down, so rendezvoused with Boss, who had retrieved the data from Sev's target data banks, and together, the two rescued Sev from interrogation running into some resistance from a  Trandoshan Elite, then Scorch from the detention block. Scorch had completed his mission, and the reunited squad fought it's way to the bridge to deactivate a jamming device that was interfering with long range communications. However, the squad then found out that the Trandoshans had hatched a deal with the Separatists. In return for the ship and allegiance to the CIS, the Trandoshans would receive technology. The Deltas then had to fight off a droid incursion, and then aid another newly-arrived Acclamator ship, the <i>Arrestor</i>, in destroying the Droid control ship.      <br/> <br/><strong>Kashyyyk  <br/></strong>Fixer, along with the rest of Delta Squad, was then deployed to the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk. They first come up against well-armed Trandoshans, however Sev sees it as 'textbook Trando camp defense'. However, as they get deeper into the camp, a small fighter flies overhead. Boss asks for an ID, and Advisor identifies it as General Grievous's personal fighter. Boss confirms Grievous's  presence on Kashyyyk, and the Squad then has to endure attacks from the Magna Guards. Advisor orders them to rescue Tarfful, the Wookiee leader. After this has been achieved, the squad is ordered to blow a bridge up which would impair the Separatist invasion. However, after a minor hiccup in the plan, the squad has to use a Wookiee rocket launcher to blow the gas tank beneath the bridge, which impairs the invasion. Then, the Squad aids the Wookiees in destroying several droids while fighting towards the city power generators, to prepare automatic defense turrets. However, there is another hiccup--a Separatist dropship arrives. There were four turbolaser turrets beneath the ship, so Fixer mans one and aids the destruction of the dropship. However, their victory is short-lived--the squad loses contact with Sev, and new orders come in, ordering a retreat. The real objective is then revealed--the Squad was used to prepare a full scale invasion.    <br/> <br/><strong>Personality and abilities</strong>  <br/> <p>Fixer never truly had one expression most of the time like the rest of Delta Squad. Most of the time, he minded his own business or sliced into a computer; otherwise, he was rather quiet and only broke the radio silence to reprimand Scorch or Sev for doing likewise with their banter, save for when accepting an order from Boss or providing his status with other individual tasks. Fixer responded to all his orders with levelheaded professionalism, but expressed clear exhilaration when assigned to a task suited to his area of expertise: slicing.    </p>",

    "description": "<p>Born to Carl and Dr. Gilliam Knute in the year 2105, Deunan Knute was raised up knowing how to pretty much take care of herself in almost any situation, going through constant training with her father.  By the time she reached the age of 17 she entered the Police Academy, and was quickly made a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56019\" href=\"/los-angeles/4020-56019/\" slug=\"los-angeles\"> Los Angeles </a>Police Department SWAT Team just two years after that becoming a specialist in weapon handling, explosive devices manipulations, hand to hand combat, and an excellent landmate pilot. This was mostly thanks to her being a superb athlete with an unparalleled reaction time, reflexes and sharp vision. <br/><br/>Then in the year 2125, at the age of Twenty, World War V unleashed upon the world. Deunan and, her SWAT teammate and lover at the time, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48988\" href=\"/briareos-hecatonchires/4005-48988/\" slug=\"briareos-hecatonchires\">       Briareos Hecatonchries</a> left<a data-ref-id=\"4020-56019\" href=\"/los-angeles/4020-56019/\" slug=\"los-angeles\">   Los Angeles</a> and lived in the ruins of “Badside” where they were eventually found by Hitomi (A solider retrieval expert), and was forced back to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57383\" href=\"/olympus/4020-57383/\" slug=\"olympus\">Olympus</a>. <br/> <br/>Because of the way she was brought up, Deunan ended up joining <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55672\" href=\"/eswat/4060-55672/\" slug=\"eswat\">     ESWAT (Extra-Special Weapons and Advanced Tactics)</a>, which was the anti-terrorist armed forces of the city along with Briareos. <br/><br/>Personality: <br/><br/>Even though Deunan joined SWAT and even went as far as joining <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55672\" href=\"/eswat/4060-55672/\" slug=\"eswat\">    ESWAT</a>, it was said by Masamune Shirow that,<strong> </strong>\"</p><blockquote><p>she didn’t get involved with ESWAT because she has some strong sense of justice or has a particular desire to fight.”</p></blockquote> Also Deunan is always armed, either with a pistol or having multiple knives, she always has something in hand that she can use to kill with and if face to face with danger, and she never hesitates to draw her weapon of choice. However, she never attacks first,  always making her killing(if she kills) in self defense. The reason of her being like this is because she has trust issues thanks to her upbringing  by her father, she was taught to trust no one, and the one’s she does trust, are just a very selected few, including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48988\" href=\"/briareos-hecatonchires/4005-48988/\" slug=\"briareos-hecatonchires\">   Briareos</a>.",

    "deck": "Alexis Rhodes is the best of all the girls at Duel Academy in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX. She has some strong feelings for Jaden Yuki that she wont let anyone know.",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Alexis is friendly, caring, and lacks the condescending attitude that most of her Obelisk Blue peers share.</p><p>In the first season, Alexis grows Interested in Jaden Yuki's dueling skills, after seeing how Jaden drew Monster Reborn and could have won his duel against Chazz. She challenges him to a duel, promising that if he wins, they won't tell, and if she wins, they get expelled. Winning through the use of \"Elemental Hero: Thunder Giant\", she concedes defeat and keeps her word.</p><p>Later she reveals that she has an older brother while visiting the Abandoned Dorm. She gets herself kidnapped by a mercenary hired by Dr. Crowler. Jaden duels and beats him, freeing her. Shortly after this, she and Jaden become closer friends after Crowler once again attempts to expel him and Syrus, this time in a tag duel Alexis is trusted with one of seven spirit keys. Watching Jaden defeat a duelist named \"Nightshroud\" who later turns out to be a brainwashed Atticus (her older brother), she learns that he has no recollection of anything in his past and must beat a revived Titan in order to restore them, which she eventually does. She later also meets her old friend Pierre.</p><p>Later she loses her Spirit Key to Amneal until she is freed by Jaden.</p><p>Near the end of the arc, Chazz confronts her about his feelings and challenges her to a duel. Although making his feelings heard, Alexis shoots down every attempt. She ultimately wins by using \"Cyber Angel Benten\" and thus introducing her \"Cyber Angel\" series.</p><p>After the first season, two major things happen to Alexis. The first event is her finally confronting her brother to a duel (and winning), to tell him to back off and let go of his dream of becoming a pop duo. The second major event is a temporary drastic change of character due to being brainwashed by Sartorius into joining the \"Society Of Light\". She develops a more cold and arrogant personality and throughout this season, struggles trying to free herself from Sartorius' grip and when she finally does, has her memories stripped away in order to suppress it.</p><p>She regains her memories after losing to Jaden in another duel, albeit having no memory of ever joining the Society.</p><p>During the third year, several students come from around the world to study for a while at Duel Academy. In this season, Alexis' role is more or so brought down to watching on the sidelines, but she does help defend the school by battling Duel Ghouls and later comes to Jaden's aid when he becomes persistent in searching for Jesse. After travelling through a dimensional portal, they end up in a totally different dimension. Jaden, nonetheless trudges on. After falling behind, she comes to the conclusion that Jaden stopped caring for her and her friends and is eventually captured by Brron, Mad King Of the Dark World (a Duel Monsters card in our/their real life). She is sacrificed in order to activate the \"Super Polymerization\" card.</p><p>After being freed by Jaden some time after and returning back to Duel Academy, she notices a change in Jaden. Who has become more rude and abrasive. Hoping to make amends, she invites him to a school party and becomes his partner for a tournament.</p><p>Despite winning, she becomes angered as Jaden is flat out ignoring her cards. Due to this, she takes the first chance she got to change partners (in this case with Blair &amp; Hassleberry). But after reminiscing on old times, she takes back the decision and wins the tournament with Jaden.</p><p>Shortly after, Truman begins an assault on the school and she eventually falls and is sent to the World Of Darkness, where is forced into an eternal nightmare until Jaden, once again saves them all. After this she decides to finally become a teacher and hopes to meet Jaden again someday.</p>",

During the time in which Angela was framed and put on trial by another angel known as, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-26040\" href=\"/gabrielle/4005-26040/\" slug=\"gabrielle\">Gabrielle</a>, both Kuan Yin and Anahita went to Earth, captured <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3381\" href=\"/spawn/4005-3381/\" slug=\"spawn\">Spawn</a>, and hid him in their home until they could safely take him to the court house where he could testify on Angela's behalf. Things do not go according to plan for the two Angels, as Spawn is eventually attacked, forcing Angela to assist him and escape to a corner of Hell. Kuan Yin and Anahita worriedly wait for their friends safe arrival. Just as they are about to give up hope, Angela does indeed return, however, it is only to rest for a bit, as she has decided to work freelance.

In exchange for his freedom he under went extreme testing of Darkk's regenerating experiments. All evidence of this disappeared when the town was later destroyed.</p><p>Lastic was the only supermonsters that was not created by Rhazes Darkk.He was created in a lab by a faction of the government as a weapon to combat the threat of Rhazes Darkk and his creations.When he was first relaeased from his lab he was sent after Esperanza. He was also sent after Tenth. After confronting the pair Lastic throws Victor 15 stories resulting in massive blood loss which triggers the Tenth. Lastic calls Victor a disappointing challenge offers Victor the chance to attack him while his back is turned. As Lastic contorts his body, Victor grabs a water pipe from his surroundings. The Tenth returns to his human form due to Lastic temporarily sapping away his power, causing the pipe to fall on Victor. Zorina shoots him in the back only to witness Lastic expelling the bullets back at them. Esperanza then uses her powers to impale Lastic with pipes and cables, where he is left screaming at Victor to finish him off.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>It was stated that Lastic is like a scab, once it heals over it would grow stronger. Every injury he got would heal and would not be as easy to damage next time. Rhazes Darkk has also made it so that he could twist reality, sapping Victor's power and changing him to human form (issue 2 1997).</p>",

Tom realizing what his power now is, transports himself back too. Taking a breather, Tom and Tilly hang out in her apartment. It is soon attacked by Pentagon troops under <a href=\"../../mr-black/29-56034/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Black</a> orders. They blow up this apartment too, and escape. Tilly then leads Tom to a backup hideout.</p><p>Tom is introduced to co-conspirators and is shown the tech hidden there. One machine is called GIMP, an artificial gateway to hell. Tom's next mission is to travel back to hell and talk one guy about Mr. Black. He ends up in the train what he should avoid. After finding out what he wants he releases the info source, and meets the Conductor, Tom thinks that Conductor is the God. Next day is the anniversary of Tom's transformation; he decides to seek out the victims of that man in hell. The killer is now a land owner there, and his wife and children are his insurance. Tom releases them and the killer is taken to seventh circle. Tom considers himself also saved now. Devil has information that Mr.Black tries to take down Hell's stock exchange, thus bringing it all down, Tom must go and save it. But as it turns out it was a setup, Black tried to off Tom and only place to do it would be in hell dimension, with the new guns that he developed. Devil sent Tom there just to make money and raise his stocks. Tom however figured out what game Devil was playing and bought his company's stocks. Tilly takes everyone out to picnic to bond, she hides that one of them is dying in final battle. When night falls; angels, demons and military attack and Tom Judge is smacked in the middle of it. Angels however were on Tom's side for some reason. The demons are killed and the battle won.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/429299-rapture9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-429299\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 700px\" data-ratio=\"1.5285714285714\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/429299-rapture9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-429299\"><img alt=\"Death of Tom\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/429299-rapture9.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/429299-rapture9.jpg 700w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/429299-rapture9.jpg 628w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/429299-rapture9.jpg 418w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"></a><figcaption>Death of Tom</figcaption></figure><p>The Devil's gone nuts and is locked in an asylum. Tom visits him there, and is told of other <a href=\"../../the-13-artifacts/12-55685/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Artifacts</a> that are the greatest force in the universe when brought together, Artifacts mentioned are: <a href=\"../../witchblade/29-18319/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Witchblade</a>, <a href=\"../../the-darkness/29-24347/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkness</a>, <a href=\"../../the-angelus/29-43945/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angelus</a>, <a href=\"../../the-blood-sword/18-55665/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blood Sword</a>, <a href=\"../../the-heart-stone/18-56518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heart Stone</a>, <a href=\"../../the-wheel-of-shadows/18-56430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wheel of Shadows</a> and of course <a href=\"../../rapture/29-56027/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rapture</a>, they are supposed to be God's final message to his own creation. It is the end of days, and it all was planned by Mr.Black. He gas attacks the city and kills thousands of people. It was only a way to get Tom Judge to the city. Mr.Black reveals that he who wields rapture has a say on who rules hell, he wants to rule it, and Tom according to prophecy has to decide on End of Days. Black tells Tom that he has no choice but to select him as a new ruler, then he puts a gun on his head and pulls a trigger. Tom decides to give the Rapture to Conductor in exchange that he takes Mr. Black on a ride to seventh circle, Conductor accepts. But when Tom is handing over the artifact, he appears back on earth still holding it.</p><h3>Witchblade - Signs and Portents</h3><p>Tom meets with Tilly months later and they spend a night together. Tom is hunted by a demoness named <a href=\"../../lachryma/29-57028/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lachryma</a> and he is killed in his apartment, and the Rapture is taken from him.</p><h3>Angelus</h3><p>Tom Judge was in Hell and again became the wielder of the Rapture, however it's currently unknown how he obtained it back.</p><p>He had a small encounter with <a href=\"../../angelus-warriors/65-47421/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angelus Warriors</a> who went to Hell to recover <a href=\"../../the-wheel-of-shadows/18-56430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Wheel of Shadows</a> for <a href=\"../../sabine/29-60875/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sabine</a> and said to them that carrying more than one of <a href=\"../../the-13-artifacts/12-55685/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the 13 Artifacts</a> is a bad idea as they tend to get the bearers killed.</p><h2>Artifacts</h2><p>Tilly Grimes came to Hell, and put Tom on a train out of Hell, Tom wakes up on the train and knows the <a href=\"../../curator/29-15348/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Curator</a>'s address for some reason. He goes to see him and he explains that Tom's return to Earth heralds the joining of 13 Artifacts and that is not a good thing. The 13 artifacts were brought together, and a new world was made by Jackie Estacado.</p><h3>New Universe</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1317753\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 720px\" data-ratio=\"2.4583333333333\" data-width=\"720\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:245.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1317753\"><img alt=\"Returned from Hell\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" data-width=\"260\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg 720w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg 390w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg 260w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Returned from Hell\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg 720w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg 390w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/1317753-tomjudge.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" data-width=\"260\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Returned from Hell</figcaption></figure><p>Tom Judge is an FBI special consultant specializing in paranormal cases and is assigned to a crime scene where the body of a Bulgarian mobster that was killed by <a href=\"/the-darkness/4005-24347/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24347\">Jackie Estacado</a> and <a href=\"/the-darkness/4015-45822/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-45822\">the Darkness</a> and found by <a href=\"/doctor-rachel-harrision/4005-82604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82604\">Rachel Harrison</a>, who is the current wielder of the <a href=\"/the-heart-stone/4055-56518/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56518\">Heart Stone</a>. Also at the scene are <a href=\"/danielle-baptiste/4005-48981/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48981\">Danielle Baptiste</a>, now an NYPD detective, and <a href=\"/detective-gleason/4005-43914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43914\">Patrick Gleason</a>, her partner. When Tom shows up several minutes later, he dismisses Dr. Harrison and explains that he is an ex-priest who works for the FBI and is a special investigator. He gets close to the corpse and uses a form of psychometry to gain insight on the victim’s last moments and sees Jackie in the Darkness form and several on his imps. He receives some ridicule from Baptiste and Gleason and tells them he will visit Estacado “unofficially” as there is no physical evidence linking him to the crime, only the fact that the Bulgarian mop is in a dispute with the Franchetti crime family that Jackie has recently left leaderless and gone legit.</p><p>Tom arrives at the fairly secluded Estacado mansion in New Jersey where he meets Jackie’s wife, <a href=\"/jenny-romano/4005-47571/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47571\">Jenny</a>, and daughter, <a href=\"/hope-pezzini/4005-48639/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48639\">Hope</a>. After briefly speaking to both, he finally meets Jackie and the two converse about the dead mobster. Tom sees a suit of ancestral knight armor that looks like Jackie in his vision, after asking about it, Jackie dismisses Tom and he returns to St. Anne’s Church, which is closed and for sale. While recording his thoughts, he removes his shirt, revealing the scars along his entire abdomen in the shape of the Rapture artifact. He is interrupted by <a href=\"/tilly-grimes/4005-52133/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52133\">Tilly Grimes</a>, who claims to have been looking for him and is wearing the Rapture. Tom grabs it, asking where she got it and has a vision, seeing how the universe is wrong, and remembers his entire life from the old universe, before the <a href=\"/the-13-artifacts/4015-55685/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55685\">13 Artifacts</a> were brought together. Tilly doesn’t understand and thinks that Tom is trying to grope her and she activates the Rapture’s power, causing Tom to back off. Tilly then asks about the scars but Tom avoids the question and leaves to get air, Tilly follows him.</p><p>Tom and Tilly try to makes sense of what is going on in a park, Tom thinks that he might be going crazy and sees Tilly’s appearance flicker between her old universe one and her new universe one. Tilly tells him that being crazy explains what he is seeing but asks him to explain what he is talking about anyway; he tells her about the 13 Artifacts and how there are little things different with the new universe compared to the other, like Tilly having the Rapture instead of Tom. Tom remembers he has Dani’s business card from the crime scene and calls her and asks her about the Angelus. She doesn’t know what they are talking about and as they speak, they are attacked by a man claiming to be <a href=\"/the-angelus/4005-43945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43945\">the Angelus</a>. Tilly turns into the Rapture but is quickly overpowered by them man and the Rapture falls off of her and Tom picks it up and puts it on, saying that it feels right and quickly overpowers the man. As soon as he does, five more people show up, all claiming to be the Angelus. As Tom fights off four of them, learning a new way to use the Rapture’s powers, the last one attacks Tilly but before Tom can rescue her, Dani Baptiste shows up and kills it. After they are sure they are safe, Tom tries to give the Rapture back but Tilly tells him to keep it. Dani asks what is going on and Tom explains that she should be the Angelus, as she was in the old universe and they all go back to the Church; as Tom explains to Dani more about the 13 Artifacts and they brainstorm ideas about why the Angelus is so different, believing that Jackie has somehow changed the world, as Tilly uses her numeromancy to see that Jackie is at the center of everything and Tom decides to pay him another visit.</p><p>As Jackie is driving away from his house to try and fix the situation with the Bulgarians, Tom, in Rapture form, attacks him and destroys his car. Jackie retaliates with a large demon but Tom manages to fight it off and throw his car at him, but it again does no real damage. When Tom accuses him of changing everything, Jackie depowers and tells him why: he didn’t want his daughter, toddler Hope, to die and when he recreated everything, he tried to separate people from their Artifacts and destroy the Angelus but when he couldn’t destroy it, he sent it to multiple hosts to weaken it so it couldn’t fight him and then he explains that he did it all for his family. Jackie then leaves, claiming that the only reason Tom gets a free pass this time is because Tom saved him when they were in Hell. Tom walks back to the car, where Tilly and Dani are waiting for him, the three talk about what is going on before coming up with a plan to restore the Angelus and put Jackie in check by waiting out in the open because the Angelus was seeking the Rapture. Tom gives it to Dani and leaves to draw the Angelus in but it chooses the newly arrived <a href=\"/finch/4005-57289/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57289\">Finch</a> as its host instead of Dani. Tom and Tilly rush back to the scene where it is apparent that the Angelus has taken over Finch’s mind and leaves to destroy Jackie and Tom is furious as this was not what he wants. As the Angelus flies to Jackie’s mansion and attacks him, Tom follows and arrives just in time to stop Jackie from killing Finch and the Angelus. Tom and Jackie get into a heated conversation and the only reason that it does not escalate is because Jackie does not want to fight so close to his family and he claims he has all of the time in the world to settle the score with the Angelus.</p><p>Later, a week after the Bulgarian mobster was found, Tom goes to the hospital ER where Rachel Harrison works to speak with her about the Heart Stone. The pair makes small talk when she finishes with a patient before Tom asks about the Artifact and Rachel claims it is a family heirloom from her grandmother; but when Tom asks if it does anything unusual, Rachel admits that it allows her to see a person’s aura, like what kind of person they are and if they are healthy. Tom explains that it is an Artifact but is interrupted by John Becker, Rachel’s soon-to-be ex-husband, and the two men argue; when John leaves Tom tells Rachel that the Heart Stone seems safe enough and to call him if Jackie Estacado tries to contact her before she has to leave to help a patient.</p><p>Several days later, after Rachel returned to her hometown, Tom and Tilly arrive to tell her that there is no reason Jackie would come after her. He also gives Rachel some light congratulations about getting used to the power of the Heart Stone before Tilly gets a call that Tom is needed in Washington DC to help with a murder case.</p><p>Tom and Tilly arrive at the Lincoln Memorial quickly and get a look at the scene, a man with a hole in his chest at the center of writing that is in the victim’s blood. Tom takes control of the scene and tells Tilly to take the writing down and, along with Tilly’s observance of the murder taking place on a ley line, claims that it is a ritual for something and angers the DCPD detectives on scene and leaving. When the pair is out of an earshot, Tom admits to recognizing the language as the Language of Hell but can’t read the advanced writings, only knowing that it is for a summoning ritual. The next day, Tom goes to the National Cathedral, as it was the victim’s place of employment, and meets the groundskeeper, who is possessed by a demon. The men walk outside and the demon is dismissive of Tom as he is no longer a priest, and reveals his true form before attacking Tom, who changes into Rapture and fights back. Tom is able to quickly overpower the demon and nearly kill it as it is a minor one trying to make a power grab, and it retreats back into the groundskeeper. After getting caught by some security guards and admitting to being an FBI agent, he and the groundskeeper go to the local jail. After the local detectives are unable to get anything out of the man, Tom volunteers to preform and exorcism and is allowed to. When he enters, the demon claims that it won’t work because Tom is not a believer anymore but Tom counters that he believes enough and begins. During the exorcism, the demon tries to fight back but cannot and Tom is able to exercise the demon and free the groundskeeper before telling the cops to get the man a lawyer who can give a good insanity defense before leaving. Tilly confronts him and tells him to do more for the man but Tom says he cannot as the man’s DNA is all over the crime scene and says that the pair needs to return to New York City as they have more important things to worry about, like the Angelus.</p><p>Sometime later, Tom breaks into Danielle Baptiste’s apartment while she and Finch are in the realm of the Angelus. When the two women return, and are less than surprised by his presence, he tells then that he needs the Angelus, and by extension the rest of the Artifact bearers, to put a stop to Jackie Estacado and the universe that Jackie created.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Universe and End of Days</h3><p>Tilly Grimes worked in pentagon; she was cataloging prophecies and used her skill to predict what would happen. She was one of the selected to monitor the Gate of hell entry in Jerusalem, she noticed that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56034\" href=\"/mr-black/4005-56034/\">Mr. Black</a> like know what was about to happen to the soldiers sent there. When people working on the project started to disappear, she then with few of her work buddies stole G.I.M.P (Gyrostatic Internal Matrix Producer) plans and escaped from pentagon. Now she a leader of a rag-tag group who wants to save a world. She later went back to spy on Mr. Black's operation in Jerusalem. On a certain star alignment she went to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52130\" href=\"/tom-judge/4005-52130/\">Tom Judge</a>, who was supposed to find a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56444\" href=\"/rapture/4055-56444/\">Rapture</a> and wield it, and save the world with it. When she found Tom, she told him to wear the artifact, thus fulfilling the prophecy. Next she blew Tom's apartment to cover his tracks. Walking on the down they ended up in same area where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58590\" href=\"/nick/4005-58590/\">Devil</a> dined, Tilly sent Tom to talk to the Devil, avoiding him herself. When Devil sent Tom to Hell to save <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24347\" href=\"/the-darkness/4005-24347/\">Jackie Estacado</a>, Devil came to accompany her. They shared few stories and a few laughs until Tom came back. Tilly and Tom then went to her apartment, she lead him there because Mr. Black had found where she was and was planning an attack. She of course knowing that had moved all the important work to safe location and now she was there just to cover tracks again. Tom transformed and beat up Mr. Black soldiers, apartment was rigged to blow, Tilly and tom escaped to underground. Tilly now showed Tom the secret hideout where her gang lived. They had built themselves a G.I.M.P from the stolen blueprints. G.I.M.P is an artificial gateway to hell. Tilly sent Tom Judge to hell with the machine to collect some info on Mr. Black. Tilly gets a wish to travel to the country to a picnic, but she hides her actual reasons. She predicted a death of one of her friends in crossfire and wanted to make his last moments as good as possible. They hung out until angels and demons arrived to battle over the Rapture. At the end of days, Tilly loses her ability to predict future. Tilly and Tom get separated when he travels to hell to pass on rapture.</p><h3>Witchblade - Signs and Portents</h3><p>Several weeks pass, Tilly has her powers back. Suddenly she gets a call from Tom Judge. They hook up again, Tom confesses that he has some major bad guy on his heels. They spend a night together, and then <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57028\" href=\"/lachryma/4005-57028/\">Lachryma</a> arrives. Tom pushes Tilly out of the window, when she gets back up, Tom is dead, and Lachryma is gone. She then does some quick math with Tom's blood and learned Lachryma's next victim, the bearer of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-18319\" href=\"/witchblade/4005-18319/\">Witchblade</a>. She gets arrested then and meets detective <a data-ref-id=\"4005-18318\" href=\"/sara-pezzini/4005-18318/\">Sara Pezzini</a> in interrogation. Tilly tells Pezzini the story of Rapture and how she could locate this Lachryma with a equipment she has. Because if Lachryma bonded with the Rapture, it would mean destruction in biblical terms. Pezzini believes her, and they go to Tilly's friends. When they get there, they find all the guys dead, one hangs barely on to life. Lachryma is already there and was luring them into a trap. Sara gets into a fight with her, but Lachryma seeing that Great Beast has arrived on earth takes a hasty leave. Sara Pezzini promises to anything in her power to get Tilly proven innocent.</p><h3>Artifacts</h3><p>Tilly also resurfaces after Tom Judge returns from hell to warn the world of the joining of the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55685\" href=\"/the-13-artifacts/4015-55685/\">Thirteen Artifacts</a>.</p><h4>New Universe</h4><p>After the universe is destroyed when all 13 Artifacts come together and the universe is remade by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24347\" href=\"/the-darkness/4005-24347/\">Jackie Estacado</a>, Tilly Grimes has become the bearer of the Rapture; her appearance has also changed, while her hair is still pink, she now has it styled longer and has shaved half of her head bald and sports several tattoos on her biceps and around her belly button. After searching for some time, she finds <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52130\" href=\"/tom-judge/4005-52130/\">Tom Judge</a> in St. Anna’s Church in New York City, where he does not recognize her, but recognizes the Rapture around her neck and grabs it, causing him to remember the old universe. Tilly thinks that Tom is trying to grope her and pushes him away but he gets up, telling her that the Rapture is his and to give it to him but she doesn’t, claiming that it has been in her family for generations and gets angry and turns into the Rapture form before Tom backs off. He does and asks why she is seeking him out and she says that she is a numeromancer, meaning she sees numbers and equations like a language and can use them to know things and predict the future, and that no matter what formula she works with, it always ends up with Tom as the answer and now she wants to know why. Tom answers that he doesn’t know but maybe something else wants them together, like the Rapture, because they both know the power it commands and Tilly reiterates her unwillingness to give it away and Tom agrees. Tilly then asks why Tom has the Rapture scared into his abdomen but he doesn’t answer and goes outside to get some air. They go to a park and Tom starts talking about how something about the world feels wrong but Tilly reassures him that everything is fine but Tom tells her that he sees her as her appearance keeps changing from her current one to what she looked like in the old universe, a phenomenon that Tilly is completely unaware of. Tilly asks what Tom thinks happens since he believes the universe has changed with little things being different, like Tilly bearing the rapture instead of him, and explains the concept of the 13 Artifacts, which Tilly accepts in stride.</p><p>When Tom calls <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48981\" href=\"/danielle-baptiste/4005-48981/\">Danielle Baptiste</a>, Tilly stands by and warns him of an attacking man who claims to be <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43945\" href=\"/the-angelus/4005-43945/\">the Angelus</a>. Tilly changes into Rapture form and is briefly able to overpower the man before he throws her off and slams her into the ground so hard, it severs her connection to the Rapture and Tom picks it up and uses it to quickly kill the man, commenting on how weak the new Angelus is. Tilly is amazed at Tom’s skill with the Artifact and listens as Tom tells her that something is wrong because the Angelus isn’t moving to a new host, and then the two are attacked by five people, all claiming to be the Angelus. Tom starts fighting and Tilly tries to back away from the fight but is attacked by one of the men and he starts to choke her as Tom cannot get to her. Tilly is saved by the timely intervention of Danielle Baptiste, who shoots the man and kills him. Tilly thanks her and Dani reveals that she is a detective, and looking for Tom, who Tilly points out, is still in Rapture form, and Dani almost shoots him. After everyone calms down, Tom tries to give the Rapture back to Tilly, but she tells him to keep it, saying that he is more effective with it that she is.</p><p>The three go back to the church where Tilly uses her numeromancy to try and figure out what Jackie Estacado’s connection is to what is going on. As Tom explains to Dani his theory, Dani doesn’t believe him until Tilly, who goes into a trance-like state to use her ability, agrees with Tom, sayin that no matter what she does, in the grand scheme of things, it all goes back to Jackie, making him the center of everything. The three drive off so that Tom can confront Jackie and Tilly waits in the car with Dani and when Tom returns, she says she thought that Jackie would kill him. The three decide that their next move should be to make Dani the Angelus again. They go to a nearby park and Tilly waits a fair distance away with Tom and calls him out for putting Dani in such clear danger by giving her the Rapture since that is what the previous group of Angelus warrior wanted and Tom says it needed to be done. A flash if light signals that there is a new host for the Angelus but when Tilly and Tom arrive, the host is not Dani, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57289\" href=\"/finch/4005-57289/\">Finch</a>, who was passing by and stopped to talk with Dani. The Angelus, which dominates Finch’s mind, flies off to try and destroy Jackie so Dani, Tilly, and Tom drive after her and arrive right before Jackie is about to finish her off and stop him. After threatening Tom and Finch, Jackie leaves, and Tilly comments that Tom just made a serious enemy before Finch flies off and the rest return to the city.</p><p>A few weeks later, Tilly is with Tom when he checks in with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82604\" href=\"/doctor-rachel-harrision/4005-82604/\">Dr. Rachel Harrison</a>, the current bearer of the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56518\" href=\"/the-heart-stone/4055-56518/\">Heart Stone</a>, and as the other two talk, she gets a call from the FBI saying that they are needed in Washington DC and Tilly drives, making it there in record time. When they arrive at the crime scene, a ritualistic murder at the Lincoln Memorial, and after seeing it, Tilly says that the murder is on a ley line. Tom tells her to write down the markings that have been drawn in blood around the victim. The pair leave and Tilly asks Tom what he isn’t telling her about the crime; he explains that the blood markings are in fact the language of Hell and while he can’t read all of it, he recognizes it as a summoning attempt. The two return to their hotel and Tilly starts trying to translate the language but is frustrated as though the language is number-like, she can’t fully translate it. After several hours, she finally gets it and goes to Tom’s room, where she discovers that Tom is not there, and never was. After Tom finds and arrests the killer, Tilly joins him in the police station and believes that the man has been possessed (he has but there is no evidence other than Tom’s word) and thinks that the man is innocent because the demon is the killer. Tilly watches as Tom is granted permission to perform an exorcism and is successful and leaves to smoke after telling the cops to get the man an insanity lawyer. Tilly angrily confronts him about his casual dismissal saying that he should do more to help the man but Tom responds that the man’s DNA is all over the scene and there is nothing more he can do and they have more important things to do, like finding the Angelus; the two return to New York City.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Tilly is a numeromancer, meaning that she can read numbers and equations like a language. This ability allows her to know things and make associations that are not always clear and it even grants her a glimpses into the future. With it she can see things like names and addresses; the ability is not limited to pure numbers as she was able to translate the language of Hell as it was number-like even though it took a while and was difficult.</p><p>In the new universe she was the bearer of the Rapture Artifact for some time and it granted her the ability to transform into the Rapture, super strength and durability although she was not every effective at wielding it’s power claiming that Tom Judge “…did more in ten minutes that [she] had done in her entire life.”</p>",

The stone infused her with a divine power tracing back to the Garden of Eden and the expulsion of Adam and Eve. She became Lionheart and used her strange magic to defend herself from the evil Blackheart and aid the Coven in battle. <br/> <br/></p><h2>POWERS<br/></h2>The  amber stone she wields give Lionheart access to ancient mystical powers, which she can use to fly, enhance her strength, and shield herself with a magical aura. She can channel her magic through her hands in intense blasts of divine force, or though her eyes in beams of celestial fire.",

It was his scientists who developed the symbiote suits that <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40403\" href=\"/wetworks/4060-40403/\" slug=\"wetworks\">WetWorks</a> team members use in the course of experimenting to create armour which would protect his Vampire soldiers from the deadly rays of the sun. Returning his race to glory is his highest goal.</p><p>Drakken was a prince of the House of Thom, but he wanted more power. For some reason he thought, starting a war with the humans would be a good idea, but this was stopped by WetWorks. He then went for the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51568\" href=\"/blood-queen/4005-51568/\" slug=\"blood-queen\">Blood Queens</a> throne and though he didn't succeed in killing the Blood Queen, he did manage to get the power he wanted. The takeover did not go smoothly. Waering and his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-54547\" href=\"/night-tribe/4060-54547/\" slug=\"night-tribe\">tribe</a> along with WetWorks attacked Drakken, but in the end Drakken won, and the Blood Queen went into exile.</p><p>As the new ruler of the Vampire Nation, his minions started attacking humans once again. He was eventually stopped when he tried to take the symbiotes from WetWorks and take control over the United States. His plan to make Johnny Savoy betray his people and allies backfired and after his plans had been thwarted, he was executed by Savoy.</p>",

    "description": "<h3>Witchblade issues 15 and 17.</h3><p>Tora No Shi's name means Tiger of Death. He likes his hits be as colorful and destructive as possible, he often uses high-explosives and brutality in his kills. Tora was depicted as being a murderer from Hong Kong who was struggling with small time hits. After <a href=\"/ian-nottingham/4005-18323/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18323\">Ian Nottingham</a> temporarily left the employ of Kenneth Irons, Tora moved to NYC in attempts to make a larger name for himself as a killer.</p><p>The public declaration of Kenneth Iron's fall from his building left a temporary void in the criminal power base of NYC. The yakuza saw this as an opportunity to make a move in NYC and to take a larger piece of the criminal pie within the Big Apple. They brought in Tora No Shi and automatically sent him to hit a NYC police department. The attack was successful as he managed to destroy a precinct and murder a few police officers. Tora's trademark of large destruction and chaos was left in the aftermath.</p><p>After the destruction of the precinct the yakuza leader, <a href=\"/takata/4005-103251/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-103251\">Takata</a> begin to question Tora's loyalties after he made a few comments about 'not believing in rank.'</p><h3><a href=\"/family-ties/4045-55772/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55772\">Family Ties</a></h3><p>Tora's next job was hit on the mafia, specifically <a href=\"/the-darkness/4005-24347/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24347\">Jackie Estacado</a>. Tora manages to catch Jackie without the powers of the D<a href=\"/the-darkness/4015-45822/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-45822\">arkness</a>. Even without the powers of the darkness, Jackie is still able to hold his own until the Italian Mafia arrives to capture Tora. Tora betrays the Yakuza, and in a fight orchestrated by <a href=\"/bruce-wilder/4005-58934/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58934\">Bruce Wilder</a> at the New York Metropolitan museum, gets thrashed by the <a href=\"/darklings/4060-47569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47569\">Darklings</a> and killed by <a href=\"/jackie-estacado/4005-24347/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24347\">Jackie Estacado</a> who had the full powers of the Darkness at his disposal.</p><h3><a href=\"/witchblade-blood-relations-1-volume-7/4000-420031/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-420031\">Witchblade: Blood Relations</a></h3><p>Months later, Tora is resurrected by <a href=\"/sonatine/4005-24346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24346\">Sonatine</a>, so members of the Yakuza can use him to exact revenge against the mafia for a series of assassinations. In order to quell the war between the mafia and yakuza, <a href=\"/kenneth-irons/4005-43915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43915\">Kenneth Irons </a>sends <a href=\"/ian-nottingham/4005-18323/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18323\">Ian Nottingham</a> to deal with the situation leading to a melee and hand to hand fight between <a href=\"/ian-nottingham/4005-18323/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18323\">Ian Nottingham</a> and Tora No Shi.</p><p>During the battle between himself and Nottingham they are described as two different people. Tora No Shi is a murderer who kills anyone including innocents, children, and women to get the job done while Ian is a mercenary only harming those whom he is sent to target and maintains a moral code and honor.</p><p>Ian has Tora No Shi defeated but relents and shows Tora No Shi mercy. In return, Tora attacks Ian from behind and then stabs him in the stomach. However, Ian survives the attack due to <a href=\"/excalibur/4055-55696/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55696\">Excaliber</a></p><p>Walking away from Ian, Tora No Shi then attempts to murder <a href=\"/kenneth-irons/4005-43915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43915\">Kenneth Irons</a> at Cautly Towers. Irons manages to taunt Tora and easily evades the first attack. However the fight does not last long as Nottingham appears, seeking revenge against Tora. Another battle ensues, this time Ian destroys Tora by deflecting all of his attacks before throwing the Tiger of Death into a priceless steinway piano. Ian then picks up Tora and makes him beg for mercy before tossing Tora down to the floor like a rag doll while Irons watches with amusement.</p><p><a href=\"/sara-pezzini/4005-18318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18318\">Sara Pezzini</a>, bearer of the <a href=\"/witchblade/4005-18319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18319\">Witchblade</a> arrives at Cautly Towers and finds a defeated Tora No Shi on the floor. <a href=\"/kenneth-irons/4005-43915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43915\">Kenneth Irons</a> offers Tora as criminal who was behind the attacks on various mafia and yakuza bosses in the city. Sara does not make the arrest.</p><h3><a href=\"/witchblade-75-death-pool-finale/4000-102166/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-102166\">Death Pool.</a></h3><p>With Tora No Shi beaten, <a href=\"/kenneth-irons/4005-43915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43915\">Kenneth Irons</a> takes him in as a man servant and personal bodyguard. Tora goes through the process of being implemented and receives transfusions, chemical baths, incantations, and Ta Moka, thus attempting to improve him with a slight increase in strength and agility according to co-creator David Wohl.</p><p>During one of Kenneth Iron's executive board meetings, Tora spots <a href=\"/ian-nottingham/4005-18323/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18323\">Ian Nottingham</a> in open public and nearly craps in his pants. Irons notices Nottingham as well, and then promptly cancels the meeting and brings Tora down to Level 42, an underground facility that provides Tora with training. There Tora battles a pyro-kinetic. Initially Tora is losing the battle but manages to disarm and then decapitates his opponent.</p><p>Still he is no match for Ian Nottingham, who easily kills him, hanging Tora's limp body upside down with the powers of the Excalibur.</p><h3>Cameo and Flashback Appearances.</h3><p>Tora No Shi is the first one voted off during Top Cow's 'Deathpool' storyline for the Witchblade comic from issues 70-75 of Witchblade. According to Top Cow, Tora received the greatest amount of votes to die.</p><p>Tora No Shi makes cameo appearances in Witchblade 100 and 150, during flashback and reflection moments. Tora is seen knocked out on a guard railing as <a href=\"/sara-pezzini/4005-18318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18318\">Sara Pezzini </a>stands over him in issue 100..</p><p>He has not made an appearance since the rebirth of the Top Cow universe following the events of Artifacts.</p><p>Tora No Shi makes a brief cameo in Witchblade Case Files #1, under a file relating to Jackie Estacado, stating that Tora was once a rival of the wielder of the Darkness.</p>",

However this new lease on life becomes troublesome when ghosts begin haunting Jon, slowly growing in number as time passes.</p><p>They began to drive Jon crazy as they all spoke out at once, creating the effect of sinister moaning and hisses. And it was at the point that he was about to completely snap, his guardian came in the form of Wraith, the ghost of his dog. He drove the spirits away, allowing his master of have some peace and rest.</p><p>In time, Jon came to befriend the ghosts when he realized they were friendly and just needed someone to talk to. Some sought out an answer to their questions so they could peacefully go to rest while still others enjoyed being tied to the physical plane.</p><p>Brandi, Jon's boyfriend however was different from the rest, though she chose to remain in the physical world she was not happy about it. She became bitter and depressed, no longer a pleasant person to be around.</p><p>He still talked to her though as he was the caretaker of the Salem Woods Cemetery where she lived, Jon thought it was a pleasant place until the night when all sorts of miscreants show their face. So it was that Jon realized the best way to guard the cemetery would be to scare away its attackers and so he made a costume and had the spirits aid him in his ventures and until last night they had never had any major problems.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Witch War</h2><p>Skeleton Man makes his debut appearance when three men, who were hired by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49421\" href=\"/raven-hex/4005-49421/\" slug=\"raven-hex\">Raven Hex</a> are stealing a coffin from the Salem Cemetery.</p><p>The spirit of this body, sometimes referred to as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52453\" href=\"/the-twins/4005-52453/\" slug=\"the-twins\">The Twins</a>, calls out to the Graveyard Guardian to rescue her corpse.</p><p>So, fully dressed in his costume, the Skeleton Man makes himself known and shouting at the terrified grave robbers he demands they return the coffin to its resting place and leave the cemetery immediately.</p><p>He jumps off from the monument that he stands upon, attacking the men who are becoming terrified at the coming of this ghost, this \"skeleton man\".</p><p>The Graveyard Guardian manages to take out two of the men, beating them mercilessly in his rage.</p><p>However, the third grave robber comes up behind Jon, calling him the \"Cemetery Clown\" and then proceeds to attempt to hit him in the back of the head with a shovel.</p><p>However, the speech causes the Graveyard Guardian to turn around and catch the shovel with his hands, he then rips it from the man's grasp and boots him in the face.</p><p>Leaving the freshly injured man on the ground he turns to face <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53127\" href=\"/kreskin/4005-53127/\" slug=\"kreskin\">Kreskin</a>, who is also holding a shovel and plans to bash the Skeleton Man with it.</p><p>Kreskin brings his shovel down hard, unfortunately it is easily stopped by Jon who blocks it with his own. He then proceeds to fight the foolish man, disarming him and finally hitting him across the face with the handle of the shovel.</p><p>Kreskin and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53128\" href=\"/pierce/4005-53128/\" slug=\"pierce\">Pierce</a> were now cowering on the ground when the Skeleton Man once again says, \"We want you to leave these hallowed grounds.\"</p><p>As the terrified men lay on the ground they ask him what he means about \"we\". It is then that the numerous spirits surrounding their own Guardian reveal themselves, simply driving more fear into the men's hearts and so they flee.</p><p>It is then that The Twins scream in fear when they realize the third man is running off with their body. The Skeleton Man tells them not to worry as he calls forth his ghost \"pet\", Wraith and orders him to attack the man.</p><p>Wraith obviously succeeds in short order and the Fright Knight comes over to once again verbally attack the man. With the Wraith ready to kill the man, it seems the words sink in this time and the Skeleton Man feels he has done his job, as the cemetery is safe from robbers once again.</p><p>But unfortunately for him, this peace does not even last a minute, as when he turns around he is met with ghouls that could only be imagined by the darkest of minds...a trio of energy emanating, living pumpkins, supported by skeletons that enabled their movement.</p><p>The Graveyard Guardian believes himself to be unable to fight back and cowers from the impending doom. Yet his attacker surprisingly bursts thanks to an unseen force and the Skeleton Man looks around to see if he can locate it.</p><p>It is revealed to be a beautiful young woman, wearing a very revealing armor and wielding a mighty sword. She catches his gaze and he watches her battle his foes for some time but when she is thrown to the ground he decides to step in.</p><p>Unleashing his fists of fury on one of the pumpkin monsters he is an easily removed threat. And though it seems that once again it is his end, the woman recovers and saves him from the beast, asking him if he's hurt.</p><p>The selfless man tells her not to worry about him but about the remaining creature, however it teleports out of the cemetery before they can attack, taking The Twins coffin with it.</p><p>The Graveyard Guardian is now angered and saddened at his own failure and pulls off his face mask. He shouts in his rage as he sums up the events of the night but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48685\" href=\"/tarot/4005-48685/\" slug=\"tarot\">Tarot</a> tells him to cool down.</p><p>She touches him and to her surprise feels a spark, as the Lovers tarot card flashes in her mind. He pulls away in surprise asking Tarot if she felt what he had.</p><p>Tarot tells him it was nothing and quickly changing subjects asks him if he's willing to help her in her mission. He agrees to it, as long as it includes getting the coffin back.</p><p>She assures him it will not be an easy task but he refuses to back down saying, \"If they have what I'm looking for, then bring 'em on, I have a bone to pick with them!\"</p><p>In the dawn of October 30, at the Salem Woods Cemetery, flesh and earth are warmed by the sun's first rays of light. However, what it reveals is two heroes, clad in leather, disappointment clearly seen on their faces.</p><p>Tarot tells Skeleton Man that she must care for him, before the infection sets in because of his multiple wounds. But he assures her there nothing serious and that they can wait.</p><p>He then calls Sally and Susan leaving Tarot so that he can talk to the young girls he always puts before himself. With a sad voice he tells them to have the other spirits release the grave robbers as he is sure they must be scared enough by now and will no longer be a threat.</p><p>However, the young girls innocently inquire about their body and Jon tells them that they need not worry, as he and the \"sword lady\" will recover it and be back soon.</p><p>Jon drops to a crouch, supporting his head with his palm. He complains about not feeling so good and Tarot tells him it is because his wounds are magical in nature and only magick can stop the effects of magick.</p><p>She tells him that she has all they need for him in her spell room but they must go there quickly, he tries to tell her he is just fine and is a pretty tough cookie. Yet things don't go according to his plans as his body gives up and his face smashes into the ground as he goes utterly unconscious.</p><p>Picking him up, Tarot smiles as she holds the dazed man, \"You're coming with me...cookie.\" and so Jon and Rowan disappear in a flurry of leaves.</p><p>Somewhere else, two sets of moist lips lunge for one another, obviously belonging to Tarot and Skeleton Man. As they meet, passion can be sensed while the two embrace, Jon holding flowers in his hands.</p><p>Suddenly a skeletal creature with glaring red eyes takes Tarot's place and places its hand on Jon's shoulder, asking him, \"Do you really know what you're getting into, Jon?\"</p><p>Jon screams \"NO!\" in terror as he swiftly sits up in a bed, having just left his most \"real\" dream he ever experienced. Looking around he finds himself shirtless, with some bandages around his abdomen in a room that seems to be all about love and seduction from its statues to its candlelight.</p><p>As his memory slowly clears, flashes of the sword, the cemetery, the dizziness, the poison and most importantly, the woman pass through his mind. He gets out of bed to find answers and finds himself wearing naught but his cheese-decorated underwear.</p><p>Embarrassed, he takes a robe to cover up his shame and begins his excursion through the massive mansion. He finds it to be a maze of flights of stairs and hallways though also a place of great beauty.</p><p>The mansion has forty foot high ceilings, and is filled with both beautiful and creepy statues. But the biggest surprise to Jon was an indoor fountain and the beautiful mermaid statue in its center.</p><p>So it is that his curiosity and desire to find more beauty leads him down a shadowed hallway and when he reaches its end and gazes through the open doorway his eyes are met with the mansion's most beautiful treasure of all.</p><p>He finds himself blessed enough to gaze upon the beauty of the goddess among all women as she emerges naked from the pool. Her smooth skin, perfectly curved form, her appearance is that of both mystery and innocence.</p><p>She looks at Jon flirtatiously as she wraps a towel around her body, leaving a tattoo of a black rose on the back of her left shoulder exposed. \"I'm glad to see you're awake and feeling better.\"</p><p>Awkwardly Jon answers that he is indeed doing better and Rowan tells him that she is glad but he must now follow her to discuss things. As he follows her he asks if she removed his costume and she answers yes, as it was the only way she could tend to his injuries.</p><p>Jon expresses that he was obviously in a deep sleep as he did not notice the removal of his make-up or contacts but Tarot smiles and says she has friends with a light touch, hinting at the fairies fluttering above, unseen to the Skeleton Man.</p><p>As they enter the kitchen, Jon tells her that he does indeed like the mansion and Tarot thanks him saying it has been in her family for generations.</p><p>In the kitchen, the two robed heroes walk, Tarot going to the counter to pour a cup of hot chocolate. While she does this though, Jon begins bombarding her with questions such as her identity, where the pumpkin ghouls are from, why Raven needs to be found, who has The Twins body, and what's with all the talk about magic...finally he asks her, \"are you a magician?\"</p><p>She smiles at him as she says flatly, \"No. I'm a witch.\" Jon seems to go in shock and gasps in surprise as she sets the hot chocolate down before him, encouraging him to have some while she answers his questions.</p><p>He picks up the mug but looks at it nervously and asks Tarot how he's supposed to know its not one of those witch potions so he asks her what it is. Still smiling at him she says its hot chocolate and Jon's palm connects with his face as he feels like an idiot.</p><p>Apologizing to Tarot he tells her its just because he has never met a real witch before. She assures him its quite alright as most people have the wrong idea...however, if they really wanted to know the truth all they'd have to do is ask her and she would gladly share but no one does ask.</p><p>And so Tarot begins the tale of her life, initially interrupted at certain points by a confused Skeleton Man. She begins by introducing herself as a Witch of the Black Rose. Her birth name was Rowan but her magickal name is Tarot.</p><p>Here Jon interrupts to ask her what a magickal name is and she explains it as a name chosen by a witch when she becomes of age. She chose hers based off of a gift granted her by her mother and her sister Raven simply added Hex to her name.</p><p>At this point Jon speaks up again and asks her if Raven is the one they seek and inquires as to why she would be interested in the Sally and Sue's body. Tarot tells him that she fears Raven plans on using it for necro magick so that she may resurrect the dead.</p><p>Jon makes his final interruption before the story begins when he says, \"One of those dark girls, I guess.\" Yet, surprisingly, Tarot backs her sister's behavior up and tells him that he shouldn't judge her too harshly as it was difficult living as a family of witches, especially since it was not done secretively.</p><p>As Jon holds his steaming hot chocolate he gasps after hearing the tale and in astonishment he asks if Raven can actually bring the dead to life. Tarot's mother emerges from the shadows behind Jon and answers his question by saying that with the Forbidden Book anything is possible, however a spell of such magnitude as resurrection would surely create a shock wave in the world.</p><p>Jon turns and walks over to her and greets the kind woman when Tarot tells him, \"Jon, this is my mother.\" At hearing this he turns back to Tarot in shock and asks her if she figured out his name with her witch powers.</p><p>She smiles at his assuming comments, as usual, and tells him that it was actually because she overheard The Twins calling him Jon back at the cemetery. Once again, Jon feels embarrassed at his behavior and tells her he'll try to think before he says anything next time.</p><p>So Jon tries to sum up what he's just learned and asks if all they need to do is, find Raven so they can get both the book and the body and there problems should be solved. Tarot's mother tells him he is correct but adds that it must be done before Samhain, which causes Jon to question her on what Samhain is.</p><p>She tells him Samhain is what we would call Halloween, it is the day that the barrier between life and death is thinnest and so at midnight would be when Raven would logically use her necro-magick. She goes on to say this will end up horrifying the peoples and causing them to begin a second burning of witches.</p><p>Jon sighs as he realizes that Halloween is tomorrow, meaning they have very little time so he asks Tarot, \"Where do we start?\"</p><p>Tarot smiles as she sets her palms on the table, exposing her bare midsection, \"We start with you.\" Jon is horrified and asks why they must start with him and Tarot tells him it is because he is the key to finding Raven, the cards have told her.</p><p>Jon tells her he has no idea how he could locate her sister but his best bet would be going to talk with The Twins and asking them the whereabouts of their body. Tarot is surprised and asks him if he means they can sense their body.</p><p>He tells her that indeed, they can pinpoint the exact location of their body meaning they can lead them to Raven if she is in possession of it. It is then that Jon explains how he became Skeleton Man when Tarot asks him how long he has been able to communicate with the dead.</p><p>After sharing his near-death experience and the origin of his powers, Tarot asks him why the ghosts just don't appear and scare people off on their own but Jon tells her most of them find it difficult to do when he's not there and he believes it to be because of his near death experience. He then tells her that's the conclusion of his story and that now all he needs is his costume and they can hunt Raven down.</p><p>He asks for the location of his room and Tarot tells him not to worry, as Pooka will lead him there. Jon seems a little afraid of meeting Pooka when suddenly the goblin cat flies right into his face and he shouts in surprise, \"You have a flying cat?\"</p><p>Tarot smiles at him asking, \"Doesn't every witch?\" Jon admits he doesn't know and that it's easily possible so regaining his composure he follows Pooka as he leads Jon to his room.</p><p>On October 31, 9:22 PM, a dark force descends upon Salem this night as magic slowly entraps the entire town in its snare, slowly calling in every being to its web, growing larger as they add to its mass but in the silent Salem Woods Cemetery all is at peace when in a magickal moment, the Skeleton Man and Tarot appear, smoke swirling around their lower bodies. Tarot immediately demands that Jon summon The Twins as time is running out, midnight is coming soon and they need the girls now.</p><p>Jon is still caught off guard at how one moment they stand in the mansion and the next they are in the cemetery but Tarot urgently reminds him of what they set out to do and Jon tells her Sally and Susan must be close as their grave is not far off.</p><p>A voice answers Jon's words telling him that The Twins are indeed about and he need not worry. However, then the voice moves on to Tarot and asks her if she is the pretty red head the girls spoke of. It becomes evident that the bearer of this voice, Brandi, does not care for Tarot as she insults her leather armor and then asks Jon what Tarot is doing at the cemetery.</p><p>Skeleton Man exclaims with joy when he sees Brandi and tells Tarot that this is the girlfriend he was talking about, Tarot tells him she assumed as much but Brandi begins some drama, interrupting the mission as she yells at Jon and tells him that she is no longer Brandi. Brandi died in the car accident, now all she is naught but some crypt chick, she has no identity she is just the Crypt Chick.</p><p>She begins to take out her anger at her current state on Tarot when she complains how unlike Rowan she does not even have the sense of touch and feelings of warmth that the witch does, in fact she doesn't even have a body.</p><p>Tarot tells Brandi to keep her out of her endless moaning and rude comments but Brandi responds by mocking Tarot for being sensitive and asks if its the red hair and then asks Jon if Tarot is a natural redhead.</p><p>A dismayed Skeleton Man tries to defend Tarot and tells Brandi that despite what she's been through doesn't mean she has a right to be hard on everyone else. Brandi spitefully tells him that she is Crypt Chick and does not need his sympathy. Finally, she once again asks Jon what Tarot is doing at the cemetery with him.</p><p>He tells her that they have come to talk to The Twins so they can locate their body and Tarot's stolen book. Brandi inquires about the book and Jon tells her it can raise the dead, making Brandi even more curious.</p><p>Tarot steps in and explains the forbidden spell book confirming that some spells within it can indeed raise the dead. Brandi interrupts and asks why they'd make a forbidden book as that obviously means the spells are evil. Tarot says that the book is filled with knowledge and knowledge is never evil meaning that the book can only be used for evil but even if they are sworn not to practice the forbidden spells does not mean they should not study them.</p><p>Suddenly Wraith and The Twins burst on to the seen, speeding for Jon, the Twins ask him whether or not he has their body yet. Before he can answer, his dog leaps upon him and licks him but after calming him down Jon stands in front of the girls once again and tells them they must concentrate on their body and tell him what they see.</p><p>So they do and mention stone walls and floors and a window and outside the window is the tops of trees. Jon begins guessing what they're in when The Tower Tarot card flashes through Rowan's mind causing her to exclaim, \"a tower.\"</p><p>She tells him that it is a long-abandoned tower of high witchery that is kept hidden from the eyes of mortals through the use of sorcery, Jon is overjoyed that Tarot knows of this place and tells her that they can bring The Twins along to locate the exact floor of the body.</p><p>Brandi smiles and says that while they retrieve the body she can keep an eye on the girls and make sure they stay under control. Jon thinks its an awesome idea and welcomes 'Crypt Chick' to the team. Brandi asks Tarot if she has a problem with it and though the tension between the two is thick, Tarot answers, \"No problem.\"</p><p>Deep in the woods of Salem, Tarot and Skeleton Man walk and come to a halt, Jon seems surprised and asks Tarot, \"This is it? I don't see any tower!\"</p><p>She tells him once again that it is cloaked, so that only those who practice magick can see it, but she removes the blindness from his eyes by sweeping her hand over them and then he sees it, a tall, rounded tower with four identical 'skyclad' women holding swords that point to the earth, they stand as high as the tower is tall and provide a magnificent image to the eye of the beholder.</p><p>Jon exclaims his surprise, but Tarot explains to him some of the origins of the tower, also revealing that the reasons for its abandonment remain a mystery to this very day. Suddenly, Sally and Susan appear beside Jon and Tarot, and he is confused yet again because he had thought they were with Brandi.</p><p>They confirm that what he thought had been true but no longer, for she had vanished and they have no idea where she is, but they do know their body is on the top floor of the tower. As if these words brought the dark magicks upon them the earth begins to rumble and Jon speaks the oh so popular phrase, \"I have a bad feeling about this.\"</p><p>As if on command, the ground bursts open as a giant pumpkin-headed golem emerges from it, with leather-winged, smaller pumpkins following in his wake. Tarot and Jon began to lose their balance but they refused to fall, for if they would have as the earth was shifting beneath their feet, losing would have been the only possible outcome.</p><p>As Skeleton Man begins to take out the little pumpkins with a barrage of fists he asks Tarot the plan to which she responds that all he has to do is avoid the teeth and claws, as they are poisonous, meanwhile, she will take out the Goblin Gourd herself. As she does so, Skeleton Man and Wraith continue to battle the winged pumpkin ghouls, in what at the moment seems to be a hopeless cause as the pumpkins just keep coming. Tarot however appears to be faring much better as she wields the Sword of the Goddess like a pro.</p><p>Suddenly some sort of mystical blast, perhaps fire in nature, pours out from the mystical seal Tarot creates in an all-out blast, incinerating most of the Goblin Gourd, and leaving very few pieces to fall to the ground. Tarot, finished with her mission asks Jon if he needs any help, he says no as he is just \"finishing up\", but that if she would like to, she can feel free, and so she pulls a few discs, bearing a symbol resembling the Star of David and throws all of them at once, so that they destroy the flying pumpkins that are attacking Jon, effortlessly doing what he was struggling to do.</p><p>Skeleton Man is quick to compliment the lovely Tarot on her throw but just as quick to return his mind to the mission, and concentrate on getting through the doors, but Tarot, a lot less optimistic than Jon says they are not to go through the front doors, for more minions are likely to await them there, rather, they shall get into the tower with magick.</p><p>So sliding her own arms under his, she flies into the air, bringing him with her until they reach one of the faces near the top of the tower, entering into it through one of the glowing eyes, illuminated by lights from within, and without any barrier to separate the inside from the outside. Tarot appears to be quick to rage as she shouts out her challenge almost immediately, \"Raven! Show yourself, I know you're in here!\"</p><p>Jon suddenly takes a back seat as the two sister's argue about whether what Raven is doing is right or not, but that does not mean he is forgotten as Raven summons two pumpkins which sprout vines that wrap around the limbs of both Tarot and Jon, raising them up in the air, leaving them immobile for Raven sees it best for everyone if they do not leave the tower til everything is done. Tarot continues to shout at her sister, but it is futile, the deed is done, and the two heroes are trapped.</p><p>Raven seems confident that Tarot is wrong, and without waiting for anymore argument, Raven vanishes, leaving a little bit of smoke behind, as she goes off to make mankind pay for what they have done. Jon and Tarot remain entangled, high above the floor of the tower and Jon asks Tarot why she can't just teleport them out with her magick to which she explains that a binding spell keeps her magick from working inside the tower BUT she tells him that they are indeed not helpless.</p><p>Calling Pooka, the winged cat comes to its mistress and she orders it to free Jon first from his bindings, the cat does so with gusto, clawing at the pumpkin that holds him up until its grip is loosened and Jon falls to the floor, landing badly, but none the worse for wear. Than Pooka frees Tarot and she too begins to fall, right into the arms of Skeleton Man who jokingly says, \"I gotcha witchy girl!\"</p><p>Suddenly everything goes still, the smiles slowly fading from their faces and the two stare into one another's eyes, Jon removes his mask, and the lips of the two meet in a wave of passion, Tarot still held in Jon's arms.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Jon is often portrayed as the protector of all spirits of the dead. Yet at the same time he is often seen as weak and in need of protection himself. When you first meet him, he seems like he can hold his own, however that is against ordinary humans like himself.</p><p>Later on throughout the series he often faces foes with mystical powers far beyond anything he can muster, and so he is dependent on his lover, Tarot, to save him. This never seems to be a problem in their relationship though because Jon is a brave man and despite the odds will often try to save Tarot from harm.</p><p>Another recurring trait of Jon is that unlike witches, he is extremely shy about nudity and whenever he catches them skyclad he begins to get nervous and usually looks away and complains, this causes a little rivalry with Raven who thinks it humorous that he is shy around her when she's unclothed.</p>",

Warlock was blasted out of the sky and Autolycus placed him in the brig along with other \"non-productives\" for execution. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14622\" href=\"/matriarch/4005-14622/\">Matriarch </a>contacted Autolycus and subtly ordered him to kill. Autolycus was disgusted by the Matriarch's order, but resolved to follow it nonetheless. However, Warlock and the non-productives broke out of the cell-block, and Warlock single-handedly defeated Autolycus' crew. Warlock and Autolycus faced off, both regretting the need to kill the other. The battle began, and Autolycus got the upper-hand when Warlock hesitated to kill the honorable captain. Autolycus was about to shoot him dead when Warlock's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55645\" href=\"/soul-gem/4055-55645/\">soul gem</a> acted on its own and stole Autolycus' soul, killing him instantly.</p><p>Over the years since, Autolycus appears in most stories that take place within soul world, most often as a mere friendly neighbor sort alongside fellow Universal Church of Truth employee, Judge <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14623\" href=\"/kray-tor/4005-14623/\">Kray-Torr</a>.  Autolycus is first present as part of the welcoming committee there to greet Adam Warlock when he first arrives after his death.  </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2747/638740-kraytr24.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-638740\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66526315789474\" data-width=\"475\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 475px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2747/638740-kraytr24.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-638740\"><img alt=\"Soul World Welcoming committee; Captain Autolcus waving at left, Judge Kray-Tor sitting at right.\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2747/638740-kraytr24.gif\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2747/638740-kraytr24.gif 475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" data-width=\"475\"></a><figcaption>Soul World Welcoming committee; Captain Autolcus waving at left, Judge Kray-Tor sitting at right.</figcaption></figure>The two often joke together.  In Autolycus' most prominent appearance since his physical death, he helps guide the visiting <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\" href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6807\" href=\"/drax-the-destroyer/4005-6807/\">Drax the Destroyer</a> up a mountain to see Adam Warlock.",

It has described itself as the sum of all of Adam's worst impulses, those things that he keeps most suppressed.  The Madness Monster lurked within the \"Door of Madness\" inside Warlock's mind, which was part of the twisted \"clown world\" he experienced due to the Matriarch's brainwashing technology.</p><p>Warlock learned that the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14619\" href=\"/magus/4005-14619/\" slug=\"magus\">Magus</a> had planned for him to submit to madness all along.  Madness was only the first step in transforming Adam's mind into the Magus'.  The encounter with the Monster helped Adam access certain extrasensory powers that he would only fully realize as the Magus.</p>",

At the time Master Meteor had red hair and was missing a white supremium from his supremium collection. Dax led him to a piece of white supremium which reacted strangely with his other colored supremium pieces, dying his hair white and caused him to remember some horrible deeds that Supreme had done to him in his timeline. Master Meteor fled into a portal in order to get revenge on an older Supreme.</p><p>In the present he was summoned again by Darius Dax. Now calling himself Supremium Man he quickly went off to attack Supreme, tracking him with his white supremium. He attacked Supreme's work, only to run into Billy Friday, who caused another strange reaction with his white supremium. The two were fused turning his hair red once more and his white supremium no longer functioning. Master Meteor traveled to the past through a portal unknowingly starting the time loop once more.</p>",
