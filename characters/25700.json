    "deck": "Ryuhou is a member of HOLY and one of the main characters in s.CRY.ed. His cold and detached personality makes him the ultimate opposite for Kazuma. Ryuhou cares for order and peace above all other things.",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Ryuhou was born and raised in a decimated area known as the Lost Ground. In his youth, before become a HOLY member, he was a cautious but kind soul. Born into poverty, he was to be the heir of the vast Ryu fortune of his family. However, his life changed when discovered that he is an Alter. When he encountered a young Mimori Kiryu, he accidentally creates a small crystal, which he gave to Mimori. Realizing that he possesses powerful abilities, he viewed himself as different from others and become cold and distant from others.</p><p>Ryuho and Mimori continued their friendship for around half a year, but soon Mimori had to return back to the Mainland. Not long afterwards. Ryuho's mother, Keika, and his dog, Zetsuei were both killed by an Alter (who he believed was a Native Alter) with a white left arm and a black right arm. In a mixture of anger and sadness, Ryuho created his Alter, a humanoid figure he named after his late dog, Zetsuei Ever since then, Ryuho changed into an empty, entirely callous man who became determined of ridding the Lost Ground of every Native Alter he came across.</p><p>In the beginning of the series, Ryuho was tasked by HOLY to capture Kazuma. He defeated Kazuma easily with little effort. Ryuho felt that he ignited a fire within Kazuma after he escapes HOLY, and since then, the two have became fierce rivals. Kazuma triumphs over HOLY time and time again and eventually comes across Ryuho once again. This time, Ryuho summons the full power of Zetsuei. The two become so obessed of killing eachother, that they lose nearly all sense of reason and their immense power sends the Lost Ground into a second Great Uprising, resulting in Ryuho temporally suffering from amnesia in the process.</p><p>With no knowledge of him being an Alter user, Ryuho decided to aid those in the Lost Ground. Scherice and Urizane, both two of his closest allies arrive to take him back into HOLY, but he does not remember them and swiftly refuses their offer, choosing instead to protect the Lost Ground.</p><p>After a heinous plot set by other HOLY officers, and former allies, Unkei and Kigetsuki, Ryuho's memory is restored after defeating them.</p><p>Disgusted with the actions of HOLY trying bring him back, including the kidnapping of his new friend Kanami (who is also Kazuma's close friend), he dispands from HOLY. However, Kigetsuki launches another attack. After reuniting with Mimroi and Kazuma, both Kazuma and Ryuho are forced to work together and defeat Kigetsuki.</p><p>They soon come to learn that the attack was actually crafted the new commander of HOLY, Kyoji Mujo. Mujo uses a satellite to contact Ryuho and Kazuma and reveals that he was trying to use Ryuho's father, Tairen, in order to gain Ryuho's fortune. Mujo then states that Tairen killed himself in order to protect his son's birthright.</p><p>Afterwards, Kazuma and Ryuho decided to take the fight to Mujo at his altered HOLY HQ. There, Ryuho encountered his former commander, Zigmarl, and they battle. Zigmarl reveals that the Alter that killed his mother was a Native Alter, but actually a being from a parallel Alter dimension, and lied to Ryuho to keep him as a stronger enforcer of HOLY. He also reveals the Alter was looking for Ryuho in order to gain mother and tells Ryuho that he is the cause of his mother's death.</p><p>Consumed with anger, Ryuho unleashes his true power and gains the ultimate form of Zetsuei, Zetsuei Touryudan and kills Zigmarl, though Zigmarl reveals that it was actually his plan hone Ryuho in order to defeat Mujo.</p><p>Ryuho then comes across the Alter that killed his mother, also known as the Crystal Alter, and engages it in battle. However, its power greatly surpassed Ryuho's and eventually killed him. However, due to Scherice using her healing Alter power, Eternal Devote, Ryuho was revived, but not without Scherice sacrificing herself.</p><p>As Kazuma and Ryuho final confront Mujo, he is once again pitted the Crystal Alter while Kazuma dealt with Mujo. Ryuho is no match for the Alter's power, until he transforms in his Zetsuei Touryudan form and defeats it.He then assists Kazuma in defeating Kyoji Mujo for good with their final forms.</p><p>Following Mujo's defeat, Kazuma and Ryuho work together in order to destroy a military Invasion from the Mainland for several months. Though will never admit it, they came to respect each other. They then engage in one final battle to decide who is stronger, pushing their abilities to their limits. After a lengthy fight, the two are rendered exhausted and unconscious.</p><h2>Powers, Abilities, and Transformation</h2><p>Like most characters is the series, Ryuho is an Alter. He is capable of altering matter through intense. He utilzes his abilties in order to his Alter, Zetseui.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2959829-3835044237-Zetsu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2959829\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2959829-3835044237-Zetsu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2959829\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2959829-3835044237-Zetsu.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2959829-3835044237-Zetsu.jpg 640w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111111167/2959829-3835044237-Zetsu.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2959829-3835044237-Zetsu.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p><strong>Zetseui Stage 1(Sealed)</strong>: Ryuho's Alter, named after his deceased doberman.

    "deck": "Jax is a longtime soldier and a member of the US Special Forces. He was tasked with bringing in the Black Dragon Kano and ended up becoming involved with Raiden during the Outworld tournament of Mortal Kombat to save his partner Sonya Blade.",
    "description": "<h2>Pre Mortal Kombat</h2><p>Major Jackson Briggs is known as a very competent soldier, he operates a special branch of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55045\" href=\"/us-special-forces/4060-55045/\">US Special Forces</a> that is setup to take down organized crime syndicates like the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-54221\" href=\"/black-dragon/4060-54221/\">Black Dragon</a>s. Major Briggs and his subordinate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47818\" href=\"/sonya-blade/4005-47818/\">Sonya Blade</a> used an informant named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49431\" href=\"/kano/4005-49431/\">Kano</a> to raid Black Dragon weapons deposits. Later Kano betrayed Jax and Sonya and was revealed to be a high ranking member of the Black Dragons. A lot to Jax's team was killed during his betrayal including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-78104\" href=\"/lieutenant-lance/4005-78104/\">Lieutenant Lance</a>, Sonya Blade's partner. Jax was able to deal Kano an extreme wound by crushing one of his eye sockets. Jax and Sonya were able to place many Black Dragon thugs behind bars. Kano was able to free these members including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62881\" href=\"/jarek/4005-62881/\">Jarek</a>, No-Face, Tasia, and Tremor. The Black Dragons then escaped to a warehouse, Lieutenant Sanchez had them surrounded, but before Jax could arrive on the scene they were wiped out. Jax then equipped a pair of prototype bionic arms for added strength. Once Jax had reached the warehouse he was able to fight and dispatch No-Face in a fight, killing him in the process. Jax followed Kano's trail into the sewers where he was ambushed by Tasia. Her sword skills were no match for Jax's strength. Jax then lost Kano's trail though received word from his intel officer Gemini of a coperate building being used as a Black Dragon front. After raiding the building Jax confronted Jarek and defeated him in combat, though Jarek would live to plague Jax later. After an investigation of the building Jax was lead to the lost city of Sinkiang where he battled the former Lin Kuei Tremor. After killing Tremor Jax discovered a portal to Outworld and was transported to Kano. Kano planned to use an artifact called the Eye of Chitian to further the Black Dragons criminal Empire. After a brutal fight Jax was victorious and used the Eye to teleport back to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\" href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\">Earthrealm</a> and imprison Kano. Kano would escape at a later date and be found by Jax's squad boarding a boat for an unknown destination. Sonya Blade would follow leaving Jax to wonder and worry where his partner went. Both Sonya and Kano became participants in the Mortal Kombat tournament. Jax would soon learn of the other realms.</p><h2>Mortal Kombat 2</h2><p>After the end of the first Mortal Kombat tournament, Jax went looking for clues to the whereabouts of Sonya Blade. He located instead <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49420\" href=\"/johnny-cage/4005-49420/\">Johnny Cage</a> outside the Special Forces headquarters. Jax detained and interrogated him to learn what happened to Sonya. Johnny Cage explained the Mortal Kombat tournament though He did not believe the fantastical story until Sonya sent Jax a video feed telling him that she and Kano were working together to escape Outworld. After apologizing to Johnny for not believing him he let him leave and then arrived to aid Johnny on his set when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49425\" href=\"/kintaro/4005-49425/\">Kintaro</a> came to kill him. Jax would then travel to Outworld to participate in the tournament along with the other Earthrealm warriors under <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49423\" href=\"/rayden/4005-49423/\">Raiden</a>. At the conclusion when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47119\" href=\"/liu-kang/4005-47119/\">Liu Kang</a> defeated Shao Kahn Jax was able to arrest Kano once more though he escaped after they crossed back into Earthrealm. Jax met with his superiors to discuss what had happened. The Military and Government didn't believe the major who called for stronger action against Outworld and tried to warn them of the imminent danger. Jax had to resort to stockpiling weaponry in case Shao Kahn ever again possessed a threat. That day would come a lot sooner than Major Briggs suspected.</p><h2>Mortal Kombat 3</h2><p>Jax was one of the few Earthrealm warriors to be recruited by Raiden to face the invasion of Outworld. Jax outfitted himself with the bionic arm implants once again to increase his strength and overall effectiveness in battle. Jax was forced to hide in the shadows along with, Liu Kang, Kitana, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49422\" href=\"/kung-lao/4005-49422/\">Kung Lao</a>, Johnny Cage, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-65512\" href=\"/nightwolf/4005-65512/\">Nightwolf</a>, Sonya Blade, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-65510\" href=\"/kabal/4005-65510/\">Kabal</a>, Kurtis Stryker, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42244\" href=\"/sub-zero/4005-42244/\">younger Sub-Zero</a>. Raiden protected their souls from Shao Kahn's magic though this did not extend to the body and the group was forced to fight off Shao Kahn's extermination squads. Kung Lao is the first to fight Shao Kahn though he is badly beaten and left for dead. Liu Kang then fights and defeats the emperor restoring Earthrealm to its former state. Jax survives the events and goes on to found the Outworld Investigation Agency with the mission of using science to open portals to explore other realms and to close all portals leading to Outworld.</p><h2>Mortal Kombat 4</h2><p>Later the fledgeling Agency experience trouble when Agent Sonya Blade disappeared while looking for the supposed last member of the Black Dragons, Jarek. Jax had fought and defeated Jarek before though failed to kill him. Jax was worried due to Sonya's failed check ins though learned from Raiden that she became involved in the battle against the fallen Elder God Shinnok and his coup over Edenia. Jax was able to assist after the initial assault and helped drive back Shinnok and his demon minions. Jax and Sonya also located a damaged Cyrax who had become trapped in the Edenian desert. The y repaired him and restored his humanity gaining another ally for their agency. Jax also personally fought and defeated Jarek a second time and threw him off a cliff killing him. Or so he thought, Jarek would survive once again by using his sword to slow his fall by stabbing it into the cliff. Gravely wounded but not dead Jarek used this as a cover to move undetected and plotted revenge against Jax.</p><h2>Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance</h2><p>Years later Jax would recruit another promising member into his agency, the blind swordsman <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53309\" href=\"/kenshi/4005-53309/\">Kenshi</a>. Kenshi sought to eliminate Shang Tsung and used Jax's portal stations to travel to Outworld so he could eliminate the sorcerer for blinding him. Kenshi was given a mission to locate another of Jax's subordinates though this time it was not Sonya Blade who was missing. The cyborg Cyrax had become stranded in Outworld when his wrist portal device had become damaged. During the misson the OIA agency building was nuked by a traitor named Hsu Hao. Hsu Hao was in fact a Red Dragon clansmen working under a man named Mavado. After these events Jax was once again summoned by Raiden to deal with dark forces outside of Earthrealm though this time it was the plans of the sorcerors <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53257\" href=\"/quan-chi/4005-53257/\">Quan Chi</a> and Shang Tsung who had disposed of Shao Kahn and killed Liu Kang. Jax used this trip into Outworld to find Hsu Hao and Jax then tore out the artificial heart device keeping him alive, killing him. Once the Deadly Alliance had reached its goal Jax and his fellow Earthrealm warriors made a final stand against them. Kung Lao and Kitana battled the sorcerers while Jax, Sonya, and Johnny Cage battled the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58434\" href=\"/tarkatan/4060-58434/\">Tarkatan</a> hordes under their command. All five would be slain that day leaving Raiden to battle Quan Chi and Shang Tsung himself. After Raiden lost the fight Onaga, the Dragon King, resurrected himself and proceeded to attack the Deadly Alliance and Raiden. Raiden's self sacrificing blast had little effect and the Earthrealm warriors, Jax included, were resurrected by Onaga as slaves to his will. Jax would later be freed by the spirit of Liu Kang and the soul construct Ermac.</p><h2>Armageddon</h2><p>Jax would later reform the Outworld Investigation Agency and use it has a force to deal with the Black Dragon, Red Dragon, and Tekunin clan lead by the former Lin Kuei cyborg Sektor. During a raid on one of the Tekunin airships Jax and his team were captured and presumed dead since Sonya Blade had received weird readings from Jax's scanners. Jax would later arrive at the battle just outside of the Pyramid of Argus where he joined the forces of light against most of the evil fighters across the realms. Jax would go on to break Quan Chi's leg, though he would be sent flying by Shao Kahn. Jax along with every warrior besides Shao Kahn would die during this fight. Jax was killed by a spear possibly indicating <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70927\" href=\"/hotaru/4005-70927/\">Hotaru</a> to be his killer. Raiden would then send a message back in time in an effort to change the past to prevent Shao Kahn from gaining the ultimate power of Blaze.</p><h2>Mortal Kombat 2011</h2><p>Due to Raiden's interference with the time stream Jax has a notably different role. Jax is first seen being held priosner in Goro's lair during the first Mortal Kombat tournament where he is used as incentive for Sonya Blade to particiapte. After being tortured and beaten Sonya rescues the Major and calls in a helicopter to pick them up. This ride is promptly destroyed by Shang Tsung who forces Sonya to fight Kano while Jax cannot even stand. After Sonya wins Raiden appears and heals Jax's wounds and explains the meaning behind his visions of the future. Jax does not participate in the tournament itself though is witness to the death of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42245\" href=\"/noob-saibot/4005-42245/\">older Sub-Zero</a> as well as Liu Kang's victory over Shang Tsung. After the tournament at the Wu Shi Academy Jax is present when Shang Tsung sends a Tarkatan horde to ransack the temple and force the Earthrealm warriors into a second tournament. jax defeats a number to Tarkatan though is knocked out during the battle. When he awakens he finds Sonya Blade has been kidnapped and immediately jumps to rescue her. Jax due to his impetuous nature is the first combatant to fight in the Outworld tournament by fighting Baraka in Shao Kahn;s throne room. Jax emerges victorious and then travels with Cage and Raiden to find Sonya Blade while Liu Kang and Kung Lao free their Shaolin masters. Once inside the armory Jax has an altercation with Cage that results in Cage getting a black eye. Jax then proceeds to fight and defeat Jade as well as Sheeva to free Sonya. After freeing Sonya, Jax was able to detect high levels of technology in Outworld. Since this could only come from Earth Sonya and Jax traveled to find the source. Surprisingly they found the younger Sub-Zero who was searching for the reason his brother died. After explaining Scorpion was the killer Ermac appeared to challenge the intruders. Jax was the first to setup though this would cost him dearly. Ermac telekinetically ripped both if Jax's arms off. After Sub-Zero defeated Ermac he gave the location of a portal back to Earth for Sonya to take the gravely injured Jax to. Jax would later appear during Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm with his bionic arms. He would restore Cyber Sub-Zero's humanity like he did in the standard timeline to Cyrax.

Kano has gotten the better of Jax thus far, leading the Special Forces into numerous deadly ambushes.

His father was a British diplomat who shot himself over a scandal, and his mother killed herself soon after that. He was sent to catholic orphanage, where he discovered his power. He saw humans true faces, like that the head priest was a vampire and some of the nuns were succubi. He was tormented by other children there, and the workers encouraged them to continue. He committed his first murder at the age of seven. <a href=\"/morgan-gallows/4005-52607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52607\">Morgan Gallows</a> came into his life, and trained Shepherd to be a government assassin. He soon split from Gallows and the government, selling his skill to the highest bidder. Unfortunately he was captured in South America, and was tortured for three months, where is mind snapped. His captors shot him in the head and left him for dead, but survived; the bullet lodged into his brain had somehow amplified his natural abilities.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Purgatori</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He returned to America as The Faithless One, used his ability to smell vampires and other supernaturals and kill them. He also searched answer to a question - is there God? He stumbled upon <a href=\"/purgatori/4005-42482/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42482\">Purgatori</a>, and attacks her, begging for her knowledge on the truth. In a fit of rage, Purgatori tells him the only answers he seeks are with the devil, and she slits his throat. As he lay dying, the Pandora Effect occurred, caused by Evil Ernie bringing Lady Death to earth, and the arcane energy filled him with new lifer and understanding; he became the Savior.</p><h3>The Omen</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/738557-savior.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738557\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.0210970464135\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/738557-savior.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-738557\"><img alt=\"When The Mind Is Strong, The Flesh Is Weak.\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/738557-savior.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/738557-savior.jpg 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" data-width=\"626\"></a><figcaption>When The Mind Is Strong, The Flesh Is Weak.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He started a Church of Divine Ascension (CODA) where most of rejects came; most of them were people with powers and eager to follow him. Savior found out that in one of his homeless centers stays a mysterious girl who has strong powers. Savior sends one of new recruits <a href=\"/crush/4005-60537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60537\">Crush</a> to follow this girl, <a href=\"/vex/4005-51694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51694\">Vex</a>. When she enters a nightclub, <a href=\"/serendipity/4005-53457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53457\">Serendipity</a> creates a distraction, and Vex is lead out of there. His mission was simple, to destroy all of humanity and pave way for those who are 'different', or those mainly influenced by the Pandora Effect and super evolved beings. Savior influences Vex to stay with him, with the intent to use her power to aide him in destroying his enemies, starting with Gallows. He becomes obsessed with Vex's hidden powers, wanting to become one with them, and desires to have her at his side. Vex finally learns her true heritage, blooming with power, and wants to bring chaos into the world on her own. Savior and Vex went to finish off Gallows, but the attack is cut short by <a href=\"/oblivia/4005-52611/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52611\">Oblivia</a>, wielding an amazing power and knocking everyone out. After the blast, Purgatori comes and saves Savior, in return for his loyalty to her.</p><h3>Evil Ernie</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Savior's mission was to con <a href=\"/evil-ernie/4005-41579/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41579\">Evil Ernie</a> to believe that he himself wants Purgatori dead. He tells Evil that they are both part of the prophecy, starting with the Pandora Effect, and proceeds to tell Evil his history. Savior gets Ernie to gather bones from a local museum to aide in a magic ritual to stop Purgatori. He takes Evil to the infamous Manson murder house, where a group of rockers try to contact the dead, and they come across Serendipity. Now realizing he had been conned, all too late, Serendipity entered Ernie's mind, trying to take control over him, but ultimately failed. Ernie's mind was too twisted and Serendipity couldn't stand it. Ernie broke free and fought <a href=\"/slaughterhouse/4005-53464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53464\">Slaughterhouse</a> until Purgatori herself joined them. Purgatori then used her telepathy to search the secret of Ernie's powers. Ernie however ordered his ghouls to attack the building; this didn't work well with Savior and he fled.</p><h3>Armageddon</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When <a href=\"/armageddon/4005-53778/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53778\">Armageddon</a> finally makes his presence known, Savior sees him as the one true God, and brings his followers on a pilgrimage to Armageddon. <a href=\"/suspira/4005-53452/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53452\">Suspira</a> and Savior got into a fight, but Armageddon didn't need any worshipers and killed both of them. After the uncreation wave struck Earth and recreated all eight new worlds; Savior and his idea - CODA survived. Joining with hell lords who now lived on earth, he helped to re-create <a href=\"/lucifer/4005-49221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49221\">Lucifer</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<br />COMIC:  <br />Thrakkorzog first appears in The Tick #11, where the Tick is already in the middle of fighting with Mighty Agrippa (the Roman God of the Aquaduct) so Thrakkorzog reschedules for a better time. <br /> <br />His next appearance is in The Tick Massive Double Summer Special #1 where he joins a super-villian team akin to the Masters of Evil called \"Phalanx of Gloom\". <br /><br />ANIMATED SHOW: <br />Thrakkorzog in the animated tv series differs somewhat from his comic book counterpart.  In the show, he states that he is from \"dimension 14B\" which is also the apartment next door to the Tick.  He speaks very polietly and has a tongue that seems to have a mind of its own and a craving for brains. <br /> <br />In an effort to clone an army of Tick, Thrakkorzog kidnaps Arthur and clones him so that the Arthur clone can retrieve a tissue sample from Tick.  Tick, suffering from a headcold, does not notice the new green-skinned Arthur who only ever says, \"I Arthur\" and eventually end up bringing Thrakkorzog a used tissue with which mucus clones of the Tick are made. <br /> <br />In a climatic roof-top battle, Tick mispronounces Thrakkorzog 's name multiple times, finally inhaling his clone and \"sneezing\" him into Thrakkorzog and knocks them both into a dimensional rift, thus ending the episode.",

    "description": "<p>The Red Scare is an American posing as a Communist super villain. When he encountered The Tick he had been hired by an up and coming hero named The Running Guy. He was supposed to cause some chaos in The City then take a dive to The Running Guy after trading a few blows. However, The Tick mistakes The Red Scare for an actual super villain. The Red Scare, in turn, believes The Tick is the hero he supposed to lose to. The Red Scare thus allows himself to be pummeled by The Tick.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Terror drives a gaint mechanical spider (that can be underwater or on land) that serves as the base of the Evileers. This might be why he is the leader. He was the arch-enemy of Barry Hubris. After Barry lost his name \"The Tick\", he tricked the Terror to launch an attack on the Tick and Arthur. The attack failed. He appeared as an enemy of the Tick in numerous adventures from then on. In <em>The Tick Big Yule Log Special</em> (2001 special), the Terror tricked the Tick and his friends to stay at a ski lodge, where he plotted to ambush them. But before they can start their attack, the Man-Eating Cow attacks them. The Tick found a piece of the Terror's costume in the Man-Eating Cows mouth (implying he got eaten), but the Terror appears in <em>The Tick Big Xmas Trilogy</em>, playing Tiny Tim for the Tick's pagean. It's unknown how the Terror escaped the Man-Eating Cow. The Terror created <em>Terrorcizing <i>, </i></em>a fitness book for older supervillains as himself.</p> <p>==Other Media==</p> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li>The Terror appears on the animated Tick series as an enemy of the Tick. Here he is extremely old (over 150.)<br/></li> <li>He also appears the live-action series, where he nearly dies while fighting the Tick (due his old age), but the Tick saved him (much to the disapproval of his friends).<br/></li></ul>",

So much to the point, he tried to murder  Hand Grenade and the Ant for interrupting his movie. He owns lobotomized dog named Host. It's implied Host being lobotomized might have help / caused his mental state become unstable.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Haseo is an adept rogue capable of wielding multiple weapons unlike other classes in the World R:2. He is a Player Killer Killer formally known as a PKKer. Haseo first experience in the World started casual with two more experienced players IYOTEN and Asta showing him the ropes. Haseo was taught the basics and lead the Beast Temple the goal point upon entering every battlefield. Only instead of allowing the newcomer Haseo gain his prize the experienced players betrayed him.Asta revealed killing newbie players was her prize and struck down the teen. This was Haseo's first experience a player kill. Fortunately before Haseo was finished off he was saved by the enigmatic player he will come to know as Ovan.</p><p>Twilight Brigade</p><p>Haseo began his adventures upon joining the Twilight Brigade, the guild which was led by Ovan. He met others but was mainly focussed on the guild co-leader Shino. Much conflict for the Twilight Brigade came from the rival guild of TaN. The most significant encouter was at the Battlefield of Coiter-Bodher. Here the Twilight Brigade triumphed over TaN. Although Ovan dissappeared in the process and the Twilight Brigade fell apart soon after.</p><p>Shino's Fall</p><p>Haseo and Shino had grown very close and continued to venture the World together. This did not last long as tragedy was soon to fall. While awaiting Haseo at the Hulle Granz Cathedral, Shino encounter the deadly anomally known only as Tri-Edge. Haseo arrived in time to see Shino and a grim figure in red leaving the scene leaving his triangluar signature burned into the altar where the Goddess of the World once rested. Haseo vowed revenge and began the path of the PKKer to grow stronger in order to strike down Tri-Edge.</p><p>Tri-Edge</p><p>Haseo became known as the Terror of Death upon enduring nonstop combat over a matter of six months. All the while searching for clues to encounter Tri-Edge as he reached level 133. Haseo coincidentally save the Harvest Cleric, Atoli from being Pked. She would later seek him out to repay the debt. Haseo is cold and uncaring as killing Tri-Edge and reviving Shino was of his utmost concern. Until he realized that Atoli had a similar character to that of Shino. This awarkward moment was halted upon a private message since to Haseo by none other than Ovan to return to the Hullez Granz Cathedral. Haseo returned to the place where it all began for him. Ovan is present and reveals that Haseo's target was just beyond the cathedral doors. Ovan departed entrusting Haseo to stop the villain and takes his leave without explaining his whereabouts. Haseo would save interrogating Ovan for later as the time had come to face Tri-Edge. Haseo came to face Azure Kite, the one many believed to be Tri-Edge. Haseo irrupted upon the Twin Bladed figure without mercy. Only to fail before Azure Kite's devastating Data Drain which severely damages Haseo's character and sends him back to level 1.</p><p>G.U</p><p>Haseo was restored by Yata and Pi who led Project G.U which was tasked to over see matters of the World. Haseo met Kuhn another player recruited by Yata as they both had the ability of the Epitaph Users. Haseo discovered within him was a power that would allow him to ascend above the average player and rival Azure Kite. Haseo was hesitant at first but a talk from Atoli and reflection on Kuhn's words brought Haseo back. This began the joint quest to solve the problem of the World in the form of AIDA and to discover the exact goal of Tri-Edge/Azure Kite.</p><p>SKEITH</p><p> This is the avatar of Haseo also ironically known as the Terror of Death. Skeith is able to assimilate data even that of other avatars. Skeith under goes the most transformations aside that of Haseo's own advancements due to Job Extensions.</p>",

He was launched into Earth's orbit as part of an experiment at some point during the 1960's, but ended up drifting off into deep space. Somewhere along the line, Cosmo was mutated and developed telepathic abilities, and he wound up arriving in <a href=\"/knowhere/4020-49201/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-49201\">Knowhere</a>. He eventually took the position as head of security of the space station.</p><p>Cosmo has since become the liaison to the new <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\"> Guardians of the Galaxy</a> and assists them in plotting their passport destination and travel to trouble spots in the universe via the Continuum Cortex.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Cosmo was created by writers Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett, and artist Wellinton Alves. He first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/nova-8-knowhere-part-one/4000-117829/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nova Vol.4 issue 8 </a>(2008).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>Cosmo's loyalty to the team was in doubt after a group of <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\"> Skrulls</a> infiltrated Knowhere and destroyed the Continuum Cortex. Cosmo was protecting a group of Skrulls and was accused as a traitor by <a href=\"/adam-warlock/4005-6805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\"> Adam Warlock</a>. Cosmo convinced Adam Warlock to see the truth as he did with <a href=\"/drax-the-destroyer/4005-6807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6807\"> Drax</a> and <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\"> Quasar</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately things became complicated when Cynosure led the <a href=\"/luminals/4060-55950/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55950\"> Luminals</a> into Knowhere to kill the Skrulls, forcing Cosmo to protect the same group of Skrulls. Cosmo would have been killed by <a href=\"/cynosure/4005-57055/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57055\"> Cynosure's</a> energy blast if it wasn't for a Skrull who threw himself to take the hit to save Cosmo. Cosmo was enraged and unleashed a telekinetic blast that stunned both the Luminals and Guardians of the Galaxy. Cosmo used this opportunity to explain and apologize for any confusion he had caused.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2683324-cosmo_guardians_of_the_galaxy_15_cover.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2683324-cosmo_guardians_of_the_galaxy_15_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2683324-cosmo_guardians_of_the_galaxy_15_cover.jpg\"></a></figure><p>After some negotiating failures of the Guardians while trying to convince the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\"> Inhumans</a> and the <a href=\"/imperial-guard/4060-6097/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6097\"> Imperial Guard</a> to stop their <a href=\"/war-of-kings/4045-55758/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55758\"> War of Kings</a>, Cosmo is one of the Guardians taken by <a href=\"/starhawk/4005-2168/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2168\"> Starhawk</a> to the future.

Cosmo is able to telepathically communicate with one of the <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\"> Celestials</a> in the Celestial Engine (a device made by the <a href=\"/badoon/4060-22907/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22907\"> Badoon</a> to stop the spread of the Fault). The message is given and received by Adam Warlock in the past through Knowhere, which is able to communicate with other Celestials in any time period.</p><p>When the alignment of the Celestials in the engine breaks, the Fault consumes them. This should have been the death of Cosmo and the others, but it was not. They ended up being sent adrift in the time stream. As a side effect of this, Cosmo was made much younger into a puppy.</p><p>Only after traveling through several alternate futures are Cosmo and the other Guardians assisted by <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\"> Kang the Conqueror</a>, who restores them to their normal states.

It was there that he met Motoko, with whom he would develop feelings of attraction that would largely go unresolved.</p><p>Batou frequently jokes with Motoko, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49669\" href=\"/togusa/4005-49669/\" slug=\"togusa\">Togusa</a>, the Tachikomas, and practically everyone else, but his serious side becomes much more pronounced when people close to him are hurt or threatened. His short temper is also usually the reason why he does not get the commanding roll in most missions.</p><p>Since joining Section 9, Batou has become Motoko's frequent partner. He is also often teamed with Togusa who he tends to hang out with when not on duty. He also shares an affable relationship with Section Chief, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49670\" href=\"/aramaki/4005-49670/\" slug=\"aramaki\">Aramaki</a>, but is not above questioning orders when tempers flare.</p><p>Batou has a favorite Techikoma (the think tanks that operate for Section 9 and are capable of sentience).</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Batou specializes in boxing and hand to hand combat, but is also an expert in the martial arts generally. He is a great marksman with almost any weapon as well. His most noted feature are his cybernetic eyes which grant him a variety of visual abilities. He also spends considerable time excersizing in order to keep himself in peak physical condition.</p>",

Although the marriage only last for minutes, Lucifer has great respect for her. After she is buried underground, Lucifer was free to take other prides, but he must uphold his arrangement with Leviatha; that he could take as many brides he wishes, but only for one night, after that he usually killed them. Only one pride managed to escape her fate; she was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42482\" href=\"/purgatori/4005-42482/\">Purgatori</a>. She managed that by biting Lucifer, which angered him and he threw her through Nexus of All Things.</p><p>In time Lucifer got bored of his monotonous rule. Then <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53540\" href=\"/matthias/4005-53540/\">Matthias</a> arrived to Hell and he was followed by his daughter. Lucifer taught Hope how he could gain power in Hell, and she became <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1847\" href=\"/lady-death/4005-1847/\">Lady Death</a>. Matthias had managed to gather himself a formidable army and went to war with Lucifer. Matthias lost, but Lucifer wanted to amuse himself by pretending that Matthias won, and took his form. He didn't manage to hold it long though, as Lady Death came to kill her father and saw through Lucifer's illusion. Lucifer and Lady Death fought, and again Lucifer pretended that he lost. Then he cursed Lady Death that she couldn't walk on earth when there is anyone live there. That curse influenced Lady Death to seek megadeath on Earth.</p><p>Centuries had passed and Lucifer's plans to see how Lady Death manages to rule Hell, were interrupted by Purgatori; who had returned and wanted Lucifer essence for herself. Not finding it in Lady Death, she makes a guess that Lucifer is alive. Lucifer then shows himself and is angered that his plans were revealed. He destroys Endless Graveyard and convinced Lady Death to give in her inner darkness, creating <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41346\" href=\"/lady-demon/4005-41346/\">Lady Demon</a>. Then Lucifer pits her against Purgatori for his own entertainment. Purgatori was again thrown through the Nexus of All Things to Earth. Lucifer invites Lady Demon to his bedchamber that night. IN his surprise Lady Death has regained her senses and has her mother's angelic energy to fight Lucifer. Lucifer is thrown to Heaven's Gate, but his not worthy and is destroyed. That started Judgment Era in Hell.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/357263-16912-lucifer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-357263\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.4075\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/357263-16912-lucifer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-357263\"><img alt=\"Resurrected\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/357263-16912-lucifer.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/357263-16912-lucifer.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Resurrected</figcaption></figure><p>Lucifer is recreated by Leviatha, who had returned to Hell and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53537\" href=\"/malady/4005-53537/\">Malady</a>. Lucifer ignores them and returns to his kingdom, but finds it gone; only Lady Death's Endless Graveyard stands. Now knowing that he too has power of creation, he sends Lady Death to Earth and follows her. Lucifer makes his new home in most obvious place, Las Vegas. He opens a casino named Inferno, and every player who enters practically sells their soul. Lucifer presents himself as Mr. Lourde, and he is accompanied with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53461\" href=\"/pagan/4005-53461/\">Pagan</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53460\" href=\"/seance/4005-53460/\">Séance</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53459\" href=\"/asteroth/4005-53459/\">Asteroth</a>.</p><p>Lucifer plans on turning Earth to Hell, and it is already starting in Las Vegas. Lucifer lets Séance create Lucifer Engine. It's a machine that gathers souls, in the Rapture. Lucifer as ever schemer plans on stealing the souls that travel to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42470\" href=\"/heaven/4020-42470/\">Heaven</a>. He succeeds in that, he makes the people think that Heaven has abandoned them, and they curse God with their dying breaths. Then Lady Death attacks Lucifer's fortress, with Asteroth by her side. Lucifer names Asteroth - The Twice-Damned and sentences him to live in shame. When Lady Death summons other 3 <a data-ref-id=\"4060-53571\" href=\"/four-horsemen-of-apocalypse/4060-53571/\">Horsemen of Apocalypse</a>, Lucifer does not retreat... he relocates temporarily. Lady Death again attacks Lucifer, but she is alone this time and he manages to overpower her. With the help of her sword <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55641\" href=\"/apocalypse/4055-55641/\">Apocalypse</a>, Lady Death manages to free herself from the bonds. After Lady Death destroys the Lucifer Engine, Lucifer is stripped most of his powers, and he escapes with Pagan and Séance. He uses the distraction to sneak into the Heaven and sits on God's throne. He couldn't be long there, as Lady Death conquered Heaven and came to destroy the Jehovex Machine. Lady Death saw through Lucifer's deception again and killed him.</p><p>Lucifer was resurrected in the new world after the apocalypse by his most loyal subjects. He first approached Purgatori and raped her, and then he kidnapped her lover <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49085\" href=\"/rakshasa/4005-49085/\">Rakshasa</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51505\" href=\"/bedlam/4005-51505/\">Bedlam</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52607\" href=\"/morgan-gallows/4005-52607/\">Morgan Gallows</a> start to gather heroes who would oppose him.</p>",

He told hawk that the bacteria would only make a large part of population sterile and thus it would end hunger and poverty.  Hawk was OK with this and agreed to drop the payload.  Little did he know that he would be killed in the process.  Unfortunately for Babich Booster Gold interfered with his plan and Babich ended up being the only one killed by his own bacteria</p>",

His whole life was in service, trying to live up to his father's standards and trying to win his approval. It was his sisters, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41476\" href=\"/nyssa/4005-41476/\" slug=\"nyssa\">Nyssa</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4917\" href=\"/talia/4005-4917/\" slug=\"talia\">Talia</a>.</p> <p>When Ra's scheme to use the body of his grandson, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\" href=\"/damian-wayne/4005-42413/\" slug=\"damian-wayne\">Damian Wayne</a>, for his rebirth, Batman beats Ra's within an inch of his life. The White Ghost sacrifices himself so that his father can live on. Ra's al Ghul is reborn in the body of the White Ghost. <br/>  <br/></p> <h3>The second White Ghost </h3> <p>A new white ghost appears tending to the wounds of<a data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\" href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" slug=\"tim-drake\"> Tim Drake</a>, after he was severely injured by the<a data-ref-id=\"4060-57124\" href=\"/council-of-spiders/4060-57124/\" slug=\"council-of-spiders\"> Council of Spiders</a> member<a data-ref-id=\"4005-67927\" href=\"/widower/4005-67927/\" slug=\"widower\"> Widower</a>. He runs the operations throughout the League of Assassins by strategizing and giving out the orders from Ras himself. When Red Robin questioned the White Ghost about his identity, the White Ghost simply replies that there will always be a white ghost which suggests that the title of White Ghost is defined as a loyal figure that has been affiliated with the League for centuries. <br/> <br/>Later on, the White Ghost contends with Michael Lane aka Azrael. Azrael is being manipulated by cult members of The Seven Deadly Sins who quickly transform Azrael into the raw embodiment of deceit or the supposed 8th deadly sin. At the same time, White Ghost breaks into Azrael's room and begins to fight Azraelalong with the other cult members. White Ghost is knocked unconscious and later awakes on a plane. Azrael tells the White Ghost that the cult has ordered him to kill the Pope because the holy patriarch has profound influence on the subject of faith. However, before Azrael can kill the Pope, White Ghost tries to convince Azrael that the power of faith is something to fight for and preserve not to destroy. Micheal acknowledges what the White Ghost is saying and the White Ghost continues by telling Azrael that Ra's al Ghul can offer Micheal the chance to find his true purpose in life. The White Ghost and Azrael work together in killing the seven cult members. As for the White Ghost's offer to meet with Ra's al Ghul, Azrael turns it down because Azrael knows what Ra's al Ghul stands for and Ra's' so called purpose would only conflict with Azrael's growing faith. </p> <p>   <br/></p> <p><br/></p>",

Dr. Kirchner, fascinated by the darkness, convinced jackie to let him live and allow him to study jackie. Dr. Kirchner discovered several abilities jackie never knew he had, and together they developed a powerful narcotic created from the darkness. Using this narcotic, Jackie and Dr. Kirchner deposed the rulers of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55707\" href=\"/sierra-munoz/4020-55707/\" slug=\"sierra-munoz\">Sierra Munoz</a>, took power, and established an inpenetrable fortress created out of the darkness.

She was in line to take over the family's God's Cry School in Kyoto, but left to get married. When Motoko was younger, she walked in on her sister and fiancee in a romantic situation. This scarred Motoko and caused her to leave home and stay at the Hinata House Girl's Dorm. This was also the root of Motoko's irrational hatred of turtles and men.</p><p>Tsuruko at first appears to be a very harsh character. She comes to Hinata House to tell her sister that it's time for her to come home and take over the God's Cry School. Motoko doesn't want to, and makes up a story about being engaged to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49028\" href=\"/keitaro-urashima/4005-49028/\" slug=\"keitaro-urashima\">Keitaro Urashima</a>. When Tsuruko finds out the truth, she easily defeats her sister. She tells Motoko that she is pathetic and forces her to lived as a normal high school student, to Motoko's misery. We catch a glimpse of Tsuruko's motives later, when she secretly tells Keitaro that she wants him to help Motoko defeat her in order for Motoko to be whole again.(Of course, she told Keitaro that if they failed, she WOULD force them to marry). Though it took several attempts, Motoko was finally able to defeat her sister and become a stronger person.</p><p>Tsuruko would later return when Motoko lied to her family about being accepted into Tokyo University. Tsuruko comes to congratulate her, but when the truth comes out that Motoko failed and has been spending her spare time writing tawdry romance stories, Tsuruko angrily attacks her and calls her pathetic. Motoko decides that her sister is right, and decides to leave Hinata House and become a nun. Keitaro follows her, and gives her the confidence she needs to defeat her sister once and for all. Tsuruko's \"molding\" of Motoko continues to make Motoko a stronger person, and causes her to recognize her feelings for Keitaro. With her work finished, Tsuruko returns home and leaves her pet phoenix Shippu to Motoko as a gift.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>Tsuruko appears as a guest at the wedding party. She attacks Haitani for hitting on her.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2><p>Codpiece began as an insecure high school student, whom, when asking an attractive, popular girl out on a date, was denied. Her reasoning was due to his height, claiming he wasn't big enough, but Codpiece believed this to be an insult to his genitals. This insecurity followed him throughout his adult life, resurfacing each and every time he was denied or declined by a girl in any sort of romantic sense. He attempted to find a doctor to do some surgery, but ran away from that after misinterpreting the Doctor's concerns and advice as insults. Codpiece finally 'snapped' when he hired a prostitute and she suggested he 'wear something' to pad the area up. The result was Codpiece creating a power-suit and beginning a criminal spree under his new name -- Codpiece! </p><h2>Creation </h2><p>Codpiece was created by <a href=\"/rachel-pollack/4040-53742/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-53742\">Rachel Pollack</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/doom-patrol-70-the-laughing-game/4000-37740/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-37740\">Doom Patrol #70 - The Laughing Game</a>. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Laughing Game </h3><p>Codpiece begins his villainous rampage by breaking into a high-profile bank, using his power-suit and it's various tools. When attacked by the police he responds with a variety of weapons such as a boxing-glove, an ultra-sound emitter, and a rocker launcher, all stemming from his massive groin-cannon. Succumbing to pride, Codpiece doesn't flee the scene and instead begins to terrorize the city. This catches the attention of <a href=\"/george/4005-67163/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67163\">George</a> and <a href=\"/marion/4005-67164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67164\">Marion</a> -- new members of the Doom Patrol. Their intervention fails to stop Codpiece and instead causes him to become even more destructive and aggressive. Codpiece is finally stopped when <a href=\"/coagula/4005-51572/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51572\">Coagula</a> arrives and uses her melting-touch to destroy his groin-cannon, thus saving the day. </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities </h2><p>Codpiece has no actual super-powers but is a skilled engineer as he was able to design his multi-functioning power suit &amp; groin cannon. </p><h2>Equipment &amp; Weapons </h2><p>Codpiece utilizes a power-suit with a massive groin-cannon. The suit itself was bullet proof and the groin cannon had the following tools/weapons: </p><ul><li><strong>Blaster Cannon - </strong>An explosive cannon blast capable of breaking through concrete walls. </li><li><strong>Boxing Glove - </strong>A cartoon-style gag weapon. </li><li><strong>Rocket Launcher - </strong>A powerful rocket launcher that could launch multiple rockets at a time all with highly destructive capabilities. </li><li><strong>Scissors - </strong>A giant pair of scissors that could cut through bandages. They were not tested on other materials. </li><li><strong>Claws - </strong>A giant set of claws that could grab/throw things. </li><li><strong>Drill - </strong>A precision drill that was used to break into the bank vault. </li><li><strong>Sonic Emitter - </strong>An ultra-sonic emitter that released highly concentrated sound waves. </li></ul><p> </p>",

    "deck": "One of the main characters in the Death Note manga and anime series. L is considered the greatest detective in the world. He is seen sitting in awkward positions and usually eating sweets.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>L was born as Lawliet, and was orphaned at an early age. Thus he was sent to the Wammy House, an orphanage. While at the Wammy House, he met Quillish Wammy, the owner of the Wammy house. He was also known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58384\" href=\"/watari/4005-58384/\" slug=\"watari\">Watari</a> - L's personal assistant. L became famous for his intelligence and amazing deductive abilities, a trait that would prove successful in the future. When L left the Wammy House, Watari went with him. Lawliet took on a job as a detective, and he had solved hundreds of police cases in which the police had dubbed \"impossible\". L was a reclusive character, only (at first) appearing by speaking through a computer (whereas only a mere gothic \"L\" would appear on the screen). Sometimes he would send Watari to speak for him, so Watari also dressed mysterious-like.</p><p>L took on other names to hide his identity, such as Eraldo Coil and Deneuve, using them to solve other cases. He eventually became the best detective the world had ever seen.Soon after, L established a greater reputation for his other aliases both Eraldo Coil &amp; Deneuve making them the second and third ranked detectives in the world respectively.</p><p>L tends to dress very casually, even in settings where some manner of dress would be required for image or respect, such as first meetings or for school. He is almost always seen wearing a long sleeved white t-shirt with blue trousers. His hair is eternally unkempt and he tends to go without footwear, sometimes even outdoors.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>L was created by writer <a data-ref-id=\"4040-57551\" href=\"/tsugumi-ohba/4040-57551/\" slug=\"tsugumi-ohba\">Tsugumi Ohba</a>, and artist <a data-ref-id=\"4040-52040\" href=\"/takeshi-obata/4040-52040/\" slug=\"takeshi-obata\">Takeshi Obata</a> for the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-42264\" href=\"/death-note/4050-42264/\" slug=\"death-note\">Death Note</a> books, and conceived as a super detective. Both creators of the books cite L as their favorite character of the series.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>It becomes apparent during the course of the comic that L is autistic, more accurately he suffers from Aspergers syndrome, as he visibly shows many of the signs. It is perhaps due to this malady that he is as effective a detective as he is. He is shy and reclusive, and finds it very hard to relate to others. He spends long times pondering to himself why others act the way they do while fidgeting with something in his hands, usually a sugar product. Though he claims the amount of sugar he intakes is to 'fuel his thinking' it is more likely that this is another visible sign of his autism, as autism sufferers have a high chance of developing an eating disorder. Another sign of his autism is how he often stacks objects together, usually dining tools or sweets. He is often found creating pyramids of food while he is thinking to himself.</p><p>The last display of autism he shows is his reluctance to open up to others. And it is perhaps for this reason that he never could bring himself to openly come out with his knowledge that Light Yagami was Kira. Being autistic, he found it extremely hard to open up to others, as he could not relate to them. With Light Yagami, he had finally found someone who was on an intellectual level to himself, and over the long time they were together, he was finally able to create a bond with another person. He had finally found someone he was comfortable being around and eventually, he was able to call him a friend.. though he could only do so with his back turned to him due to his unease at social interaction.</p><p>L has always hated losing and even admits it himself in volume 2 of the Death Note manga series. He has also admitted it in the anime. This trait of L is his most child-like trait he has. He is incredibly suspicious of others - leaving him to occasionally going to the \"extremes\" such as planting cameras inside houses of Detective Yagami, for example. As well as being suspicious and hating to lose, L is a very blunt character yet also a liar. He exclaims verbally that his suspicions are only 4% when in reality he believes them to be well over 90% (for example, L's suspicion of Light being Kira). L does not trust anyone except for Watari and is viewed as anti-social and a loner. L also claims that if he doesn't sit in a crouched position that his reasoning abilities drop 40%.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p><b>Kira</b></p><p>Many years had passed since L became a detective, thus revealing a new and difficult challenge for L. The challenge, a mass murderer, known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48703\" href=\"/light-yagami/4005-48703/\" slug=\"light-yagami\">Kira</a>. Before declaring Kira's name, there were numerous heart attacks occurring in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\" href=\"/japan/4020-55746/\" slug=\"japan\">Japan</a>. Soon enough it was no longer considered \"normal\" for so many heart attacks to occur. So, a meeting of the ICPO was called to discover the true identity of Kira, and Watari was sent as L's ambassador.</p><p>Watari brought with him a laptop that linked the police and L for communication purposes. Watari had walked in front of the ICPO and opened up the laptop. Revealing that L has already begun to work on the case before the police were even aware. L's voice began speaking through the computer telling everyone there that he was up against what would most likely be the hardest case he would ever take on, and that he would need the cooperation of the entire ICPO. Once the cooperation was given to L he thanked them. He then asked for the distinct help of the Japanese police, and when they angrily asked why he wanted only the Japanese's help. He announced that he was certain that Kira was either Japanese or was someone who was living in Japan. They quickly asked him why, but he refused to tell them, explaining that they would learn soon enough when he had his showdown with Kira.</p><p><b>Confrontation</b></p><p>After arriving in Japan L sought out to narrow his search for Kira. He arranged for a death row inmate know as Lind L. Taylor to declare his pursuit of Kira publicly. L's plan was to broadcast the inmate among several regions of Japan in hopes that Kira would attack the decoy. Kira, under the impression that the message was world wide...wrote the name Lind. L Taylor in the Death Note. Lind L. Taylor then dies by a heart attack before everyone's eyes. Having played right into L's hands, Kira inadvertently reveals that he is in the Kanto region of japan. Shortly afterwards L, Challenges Kira on air, but without a face &amp;name Kira is unable to do so. Kira, now embarrassed vows to find &amp; kill L.</p><p><b>Dealings</b></p><p>After his\"confrontation\" with Kira, L begins to work with police in the Kanto region of Japan. He observes that, based on the time of the day and the deaths of the criminals, its very likely that Kira is a student with a sick &amp; twisted God complex. L then requests information about how the criminals information was made public. Since Kira is actually Light Yagami son of the chief inspector of the police department, Light was able to keep tabs on the Kira investigation. Light thought it would be a good idea to throw off the investigation by killing criminals in a manner unbecoming of a student. Light knew that L would suspect someone in the police department were Kira due to the drastic change in the method of operation. Lights plan worked but also back fired, as L began to investigate everyone who would have access to the Kira investigation files. L then arranged for the FBI to investigate the police department's operatives.</p><p><b>Pursuit</b></p><p>12 FBI agents are flown in from the U.S to covertly aid L in his search for Kira. Light realizes that in order to take down L he must discover the limits of the death note. Light wanted to know how much control he had over people wrote in the death note,so he beings to experiment. In the experiments, Light had prisoners try to escape or write messages\" L do you know Gods of death Love apples?\" before they died.But, Light was unable to get prisoners to do impossible things like draw L's face, or breaking out of prison and fleeing to France in an hour.Light learned that even the Death Note is not all that powerful.</p><p><b>Tactics</b></p><p>Some time later, Ryuk discovers that someone is tailing Light. That person was FBI agent Raye Penber. Light would later scheme a plan to Kill the agent. Light's plan, not only fooled Raye Penber into giving up his identity but he also managed to get Penber to write the names of all the FBI agents in japan on pages of the death note. Light Made sure that all agents died at the same time so Penbers death couldn't draw attention to himself. The United States withraws from the Kira investigation shortly after. Meanwhile L was still trying to figure out Kira's next Move based on the message \"L do you know Gods of death love apples?\". The following day the media announced the deaths of the 12 FBI agents and there reason for being in japan. The Japanese police were outraged by L's mistrust. This created the turmoil and tension Light wanted within the investigation.</p><p><b>Unraveling</b></p><p>As a result of the deaths of the FBI agents many police officers began to quit. The renaming officers were, Soichiro Yagami, Touta Matsuda, Shuichi Aizawa, Kanzo Mogi, Hideki Ide &amp; Hirokazu Ukita. L then organizes a secert meeting with the remaining detectives. This would be the first time anyone in japan besides Watari would meet L in person. When the detvies get to the hotel that L had been staying in they all introduce themselves by showing their badges and saying their names aloud. This prompted L's signature \"bang, bang\" whilst pointing his index finger as if hold a gun. L then explains to the detectives that Kira needs a face an a name to kill and they shouldn't give out theirs so willingly. L arranges Watatri to give all the six detectives fake aliases and badges. He decided that they will become the Kira task force a covert unit dedicated to stopping Kira.</p><p>The following day Light is asked to drop something off for his Father and the police station. He coincidentally runs into the fiancee of Raye Penber, the FBI agent that Light killed. She is demanding to speak to L and the front desk of police headquarters.This peaks Lights curiosity &amp; through some careful conversation, Light is able to uncover that she has a key piece of evidence that would blow the Kira investigation out of the water. She discovers that Kira is able to control the actions of the victims before death. Light knows his next move is to kill this woman.</p><p><b>Overcast</b></p><p>Light begins to methodically plan a way to get this mysterious woman's name nonchalantly. He quickly succeeds and the woman reveals her name... \"Maki-san\". Light writes down her name on a piece of the death note. Much to Light's surprise the woman seems unaffected by the Death Note. Light is then able to deduce that \"Maki-san\" is merely an alias. Ryuk then annoyingly reminds Light that he can always take the Shinigami eye deal. Light refuses. Light is then able to pull off one of his most impressive feats. He convinces a highly trained former FBI agent that knows Kira needs a name and face to kill, to give up her real name \" Naomi Misora \"... even after she gave him an alias in the first place. Light writes the cause of death will be a suicide, 40 seconds later... the death note takes effect and Misora walks away to take her own life.</p><p><b>Glare</b></p><p>L eventually catches wind of Misora's death. Unlike the rest of Kira's victims Misora died because of a suicide. L thought that was a little suspicious especially because he had worked with Misora in the past. L is able to deduce that Kira was likely among the families that her fiancee Raye Penber was investigating. He sets up surveillance cameras in the Yagami Household.</p><p>Light set a 3 point trap in his room in case someone were to try to enter without him knowing. First he set a piece of paper in the crack of the door . This would rule out the possibly of his sister or mother entering the room as they would likely not notice the paper and leave it on the ground. second he put the led of a mechanical pencil adjacent to the hinge of the door. He did this just to be sure someone entered the room. Lastly he tilted the door handle so if anyone entered and left the room the handle would likely be reset to the starting position.</p><p>Unfortunately for L, Lights trap worked and Light was quickly able to figure out that his entire house was tapped. Light knew he could use this opportunity to prove he wasn't Kira while L was watching. While pretending to study Light tricks the surveillance team by watching the news through a small LCD T.V hidden in a bag of Chips and continues to kill criminals being reported in the news. L decided if Kira were among the families than he wouldn't be able to prove it using the Surveillance. L, removes the cameras form the Yagami household. Light feels that he has won as a result.</p><p><b>Encounter</b></p><p>Despite L not having any reason to suspect Light besides his own intuition<b>,</b> he decides to suspect Light as being Kira. Light, having continued his normal routine... attended a college entrance exam at To-Oh university. While testing Light notices a suspicious looking individual staring at him. The person was L, closely monitoring Light's actions. After the test, it was announced that there were two freshman class representatives both scoring 100% of the entrance exam questions correctly. Both L &amp; Light complete opposites in morality and appearance gave their speeches and sat next to each other in the first row of the auditorium. It was there when L and Kira made their first encounter.</p><p>L starts off by introducing himself to Light as L. This was done for two reasons: If Light were Kira and killed the person who claimed to be L without knowing if it is actually L, he would fall into the same trap set by L with Lind L Taylor. If Light kills L during their first meeting than it's quite obvious that the only person L introduced himself to besides those in the Kira investigation team would be Kira. This puts Light in a situation where he can't do anything but be-friend L. Later on, Light felt humiliated by the preemptive move on L's part.Light soon gathers his composure and realizes that L has no evidence on him and he can use this opportunity to get closer to L, find out his identity and finish him off for good.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>L's most useful ability is his high level of Intelligence, deductive reasoning and intuition. L has displayed these talents multiple times through the story arcs. Some examples would be, L answering every question correctly in an entrance exam for To-Oh University of Law ( トオ 大学). L, deducing that Kira was in japan. L, knowing how to pilot a helicopter intuitively.</p><p>L is an expert in the martial art 'capoeira', and has proven his skill more than once. It is an esoteric martial art that fits L's personality and agility well. It strikes in rhythmic unexpected ways, which is perfect for his personality and way of doing things.</p><p>He is a master detective, and in fact ranks first to third top detectives in the world, due to his fake ID's. He does this in order to safeguard his position: if anyone wanted to know who he is, they would likely contact the second or third world best detective in order to go against the first.</p><h3>Characteristics</h3><p>Gender: Male</p><p>Height: 5' 8\"</p><p>Weight: 130 lbs</p><p>Birth Date: October, 31 1979 ( 1982 in Anime)</p><p>Zodiac Sign: Scorpio</p><p>Death Date: November 5 2004 ( 2007 in Anime)</p><p>Age Line: 24-25</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Death Note (movie)</h3><p>L is depicted in the movie version of Death Note.

After Purgatori had conquered this realm, Satrina became one of her lovers there. Satrina returned after thousands of years to earth and sought out Purgatori in her human disguise. At first Purgatori and her traded a few punches, but then they were taken over by passion and they shared a bed. Satrina asked Purgatori what she believes in and why does she fight. Purgatori answered she believes in power. Satrina wasn't here just to please Purgatori though; she had her own plans. She found one vampire hunter, <a href=\"/karmilla/4005-63851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63851\">Karmilla</a>, and wanted her to attack Purgatori. The hunter didn't fare well however and barely escaped Purgatori. Satrina then visited Karmilla again and made her blood poisonous to vampires again. She arms the hunter with ancient weapons and sends her off again. When Karmilla is defeated by <a href=\"/rath/4005-48612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48612\">Rath</a> and Purgatori, she reveals that Satrina was behind her weaponry and charms. After Purgatori returned from China with <a href=\"/dracula/4005-48636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48636\">Dracula</a>'s fangs, Satrina and Purgatori hatched a plan. Later, Satrina ran to <a href=\"/pope-stephen/4005-49261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49261\">Pope Stephen</a> and pleaded his help from crazed Purgatori. He led her into Vatican's catacombs and from there, into their treasure vault. There Satrina ended her rouse and killed the vampiric Pope. When Purgatori leaves at night, Satrina starts to finalize her plan as well; she summons <a href=\"/gorge/4005-53759/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53759\">Gorge</a>. But things won't go as planned, Gorge does not submit to her, and when Satrina runs to Purgatori for protection; she rips out her heart, as she had learned of Satrina's treachery.</p>",

It is implied that Grace used a chemical formula that she derived from an Orca whale in the aquarium on herself and that this is what caused her to transform into Orca. She is able to easily switch between being Orca and her regular appearance as Dr. Balin .</p><p>Orca then begins a crime spree in <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a> by stealing a valuable diamond called the \"Flame of Persia\" from rogue millionaire Camille Baden-Smythe. After the theft of the diamond, <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> became involved. Orca aims to sell the diamond and use the proceeds to help fund several projects for underprivileged people. After her attempt to sell the diamond back to Camille Baden-Smythe failed, Orca attempts to kill her. Camille's security force shoots Orca several times, mortally wounding her. She begins changing back into Dr. Balin, telling Batman that the only way that she could survive is if he gave her the rest of the chemical formula that turned her into Orca.</p><p>Batman agrees and she drinks the formula. She then reveals that she could never change from her Orca form again and that she will continue her villainous ways. She swims away before Batman could apprehend her. It is revealed that the jewel was then sold to its original owner and that the money was used to build a new recreation center near the aquarium</p><p>Following her first encounter with Batman, Orca is not seen again until she appears as a prisoner in the Slab during the <a href=\"/joker-last-laugh/4045-46441/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-46441\">Joker’s \"Last Laugh</a>\" riots. She is able to escape during the riots with <a href=\"/king-shark/4005-17772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17772\">King Shark</a>.</p><p>Orca is then found dead in the sewers under Gotham City. She appears to have been shot in the head by <a href=\"/two-face/4005-5555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\">Harvey Dent</a>'s gun, although Batman is convinced Dent is not the killer, and her body has been partially eaten by <a href=\"/killer-croc/4005-3725/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3725\">Killer Croc</a>. Orca's husband, Terry was murdered by the <a href=\"/tally-man/4005-25940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25940\">Tally Man</a> while he was being questioned about the disappearance of his wife by Private Investigator <a href=\"/jason-bard/4005-8261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8261\">Jason Bard</a>. During the investigation it is revealed that Orca was working for the <a href=\"/penguin/4005-4885/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4885\">Penguin</a> along with now deceased super-villains <a href=\"/kgbeast/4005-12397/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12397\">KGBeast</a>, <a href=\"/magpie/4005-20999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20999\">Magpie,</a> and the <a href=\"/ventriloquist/4005-5767/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5767\">Ventriloquist. </a></p><p>Someone had contracted Orca and other supervillains to turn on The Penguin and rob one of his storage facilities. Harvey Dent catches them and instructs them to stay loyal to Penguin and to get any information they could about him. Harvey Dent is the prime suspect in their murders, but it turns out that they were orchestrated by the <a href=\"/great-white/4005-9063/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9063\">Great White Shark</a>, who plans on becoming the number one crime boss in Gotham. He manages to kill two birds with one stone, he weakens the Penguin's forces and manages to turn Harvey Dent back into Two-Face.</p><p> </p><h2>REBIRTH</h2><p>She appears in Nightwing Rebirth as an enforcer for a gang. She was also one of the run-offs but she felt unaccepted by them and decided to return to a life of crime. SHe fights with Nightwing but is eventually defeated.</p>",

Her foster parents gave her some of their sweets to try; unfortunately Kanako hated sweets. Her adopted family were decent people, but the only one who seemed to understand her was her new brother Keitaro. As young children, he saw that she liked Hinata House and promised her that one day they would run the inn together. Keitaro would eventually forget this innocent vow; Kanako would not.</p><h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>Kanako was created by Ken Akamatsu and she first appeared in Volume 11 of the Love Hina series. It was always intended that she be Keitaro’s younger sister and her personality stoic. During the design process Akamatsu played with making Kanako look more Chinese, and originally she sported a more mature look, before settling onto a more gothic lolita design.</p><h2><b>Character Evolution</b></h2><p>When she first appeared, while Keitaro was studying archaeology in America, Kanako had a very antagonistic relationship with the residents of Hinata house due to her desire to turn the dormitory back into an inn. After Keitaro returned Akamatsu shifted the focus of the plot from Kanako’s frosty relations with the Hinata residents towards the love triangle of Kanako, Keitaro and Naru. During this time her relations with the residents softened somewhat. By the end of Volume 12 Kanako ultimately chooses to help Naru get together with Keitaro, rather than see her deny her feelings, and lends Motoko some of her clothes after she is defeated by her older sister Tsuruko and chooses to retire from kendo in Volume 13.</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h3>Kanako’s Arrival</h3><p>Kanako appears six months after Keitaro has left to study in America, disguising herself as Naru to learn more about the Hinata residents. After choosing to remove her disguise and stating her plans to revert the Hinata women’s dormitory to an inn and threatening to tear Hinata House down, she earns the ire of the other residents. They stage a protest, but to no avail. Fortunately it turns out that Kanako wasn't demolishing Hinata House, she was just renovating Hinata House before officially opening the Hinata Inn.</p><p>She institutes a bizarre and tyrannical regime that turns the residents against her even more. The only resident who really gives Kanako the benefit of the doubt is Naru. The other residents eventually discover that Kanako has romantic feelings for her brother and, humiliated, she fires all of them and orders them out of the inn. Kistune takes charge of the remaining girls, forming the Hinata Liberation Front, and ousts Kanako in a coup.</p><h3>Retaking Hinata House</h3><p>Kanako and Naru, Kanako’s only friend after the coup, regroup at Haruka’s tea house and begin planning to retake Hinata House. During their conversation Mutsumi appears, letting slip a remark slip about Keitaro's promise girl. Kanako believes that Keitaro’s promise to that girl stole his chance at happiness and, convinced that her brother's promise girl is at Hinata House, threatens to destroy the person whom she considers to have ruined her brother’s life, unaware that her friend Naru is that girl.</p><p>Kanako and Naru (joined by Mutsumi Otohime) manage to retake control of Hinata House. Reasoning that only Kitsune is old enough to be Keitaro’s promise girl, Kanako ties her to a rocket and prepares to kill her. Naru confesses the truth to Kanako to save her friend; Kanako is crushed. She threatens to detonate explosives that will destroy Hinata House once and for all, but the House and its residents are saved by the timely return of Keitaro.</p><h3>The Hinata Annex and Naru’s Flight</h3><p>Naru and Kanako become rivals for Keitaro's affections, despite Naru's protestations to the contrary. Matters are complicated when Keitaro asks Naru to meet him at Hinata House's sealed annex. The annex was notorious for its powerful magic in bringing couples together, causing it to be sealed years ago. Keitaro arrived at the annex and, thinking he was speaking to Naru in the dark, gave his sister Kanako a ring.</p><p>After Keitaro and Naru fail to counteract the Annex’s magic with the magic of their Tokyu University promise, Naru leaves Hinata House and decides to journey north. Kanako accompanies her brother in his attempt to follow Naru, but instead of helping she keeps coming on to him despite his protests. Watching Keitaro while he sleeps, Kanako hears him murmur Naru’s name and realises her brother really likes Naru. Filled with guilt she tries to figure out what to do when Su's Naru detection radar goes off. Kanako follows the radar and attempts to make Naru publicly declare her feelings for Keitaro, but the other girl remains indecisive. When Keitaro and his entourage appears, Kanako bonks Naru on the head and runs off with her, buying her rival time to sort out her feelings.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50049/2483632-lhkanakonaruflight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483632\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.68852459016393\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50049/2483632-lhkanakonaruflight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483632\"><img alt=\"Kanako admits her defeat\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/50049/2483632-lhkanakonaruflight.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50049/2483632-lhkanakonaruflight.jpg 915w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/50049/2483632-lhkanakonaruflight.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/50049/2483632-lhkanakonaruflight.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Kanako admits her defeat</figcaption></figure><p>When Keitaro and his friends find them again, Kanako and Naru disguise themselves as each other. Keitaro runs after Kanako, who is disguised as Naru, catching up with her. He explains to her that he knew she was disguised and thanks her for helping Naru. After discussing his feelings and clarifying that they’re just siblings, Kanako returns the ring to her brother and helps him find Naru.</p><h3>Molmol</h3><p>After Grandma Hina faxes a letter for Keitaro promising to give him Hinata House if he has a wife, Kanako is part of the group (including Shinobu, Motoko, Kitsune and Su) that goes to Molmol to bring Keitaro back and marry him. After Su reveals that she is the princess of Molmol she imprisons Kanako and the other residents in her airship so that she can marry Keitaro. Ultimately Kanako, Su and the other residents decide to allow Naru to have Keitaro.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Kanako Urashima has shown an incredible ability to disguise herself as others and copy their voices and mannerisms; however she is incapable of perfectly mimicking Naru’s smile. Haruka Urashima claims that Kanako inherited this ability from her grandmother. Motoko also calls her the successor to the Urashima Martial Arts. Kanako appears to be skilled in this, holding her own against Motoko in a fight; however Kanako is defeated in her only on-panel battle.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11785/257468-185532-kanako-urashima.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-257468\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75757575757576\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11785/257468-185532-kanako-urashima.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-257468\"><img alt=\"Kanako and Keitaro in Love Hina Again\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" data-width=\"264\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11785/257468-185532-kanako-urashima.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11785/257468-185532-kanako-urashima.jpg 264w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kanako and Keitaro in Love Hina Again\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11785/257468-185532-kanako-urashima.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11785/257468-185532-kanako-urashima.jpg 264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" data-width=\"264\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kanako and Keitaro in Love Hina Again</figcaption></figure><p>Although Kanako didn’t appear in the <i>Love Hina</i> television series, she did appear in the <i>Love Hina Again</i> OVA sequel in a loose adaption of Volumes 11 and 12. Kanako first appears impersonating Naru before revealing herself and taking over Hinata House, however the residents attempt a coup that is only stopped with Keitaro’s arrival. Naru, trying to push the siblings closer together, lets Kanako go to the Hinata annex where Keitaro accidentally proposes to Kanako. After Keitaro admits to Kanako that she will always be his sister, the annex magically calls them to prevent its spell from being broken. Realising that Keitaro is in love with Naru, and after Naru has fought through the magic of the annex to be with Keitaro, Kanako willingly allows Naru and Keitaro to be together.</p>",

Shortly before Love Hina starts she leaves to go on world tour, and when Keitaro arrives he finds that she has left care of he dorm to him.</p><p>Other than a chibi version, she doesn't actually appear in the manga until the final volume. She calls Keitaro and attempts to give Keitaro information about his promise girl. She later haunts Keitaro and Naru as a disembodied voice until finally appearing on Hinata House's roof. She threatens to reveal the truth about their childhood promise, and asks them if they're as unhappy as they appear. This causes Keitaro and especially Naru to realize that they really ARE happy and that they really DO love each other.

    "description": "<p>Relena was born in April 7, AC 180, and is the daughter of Sanc Kingdom rulers, King Peacecraft and his wife, Queen Katrina, who adopted the original Heero Yuy's \"Total Pacifism\" beliefs for Earth. But in AC 182, the Sanc Kingdom was attacked by the United Earth Sphere Alliance, crushing the Peacecraft monarchy. Vice Foreign Minister Darlian, a friend of the Peacecrafts, eventually adopted Relena, and she was renamed Relena Darlian.</p><p>In the year AC 191, 11-year-old Relena attends The St. Gabriel Academy. There, she would meet an unnamed boy . Later on, her home city would be under attack, and she was then held hostage by an unnamed assailant, until she was rescued by Zechs Merquise . Zechs, having abandoned the Peacecraft name, introduced himself as the \"Prince of the Stars\", and walked away. The next day, the unknown boy is gone before Relena could introduce herself to him.  Rumors that spread around the school said that the orphaned boy was part of the attack on a base near the town.</p><p>During a shuttle flight with Vice Foreign Minister Darlian, Relena witnesses a battle between Wing Gundam and a Leo mobile suit. She then went to the Gundam's crash site, and was shocked to discover that the pilot is a boy who is the same age as her. Before she can know who he is, the boy fled the scene, stealing an ambulance. Back at her school, Relena discovers that the new student  was the same pilot whom she met earlier, and later on, she would try to invite Heero to her birthday party, but Heero tears up the invitation, and threatens to kill her.</p><p>Vice-Foreign Minister Darlian was killed in an assassination attempt by Lady Une, and as he lays dying, he tells Relena that he is not her real father, and that her real father is King Peacecraft. She was then saved by Doctor J's  workers, and upon meeting him, she learns the truth about Heero Yuy.</p><p>Relena intervened during a rematch between Heero and Zechs at Antarctica, but Lucrezia Noin told the truth about Zechs; that he is actually her older brother, Milliardo Peacecraft. After that, before they were forced to escape, Zechs asks Noin to protect Relena.</p><p>After the fight, Relena and Noin  moved to the reconstituted Sanc Kingdom. Aside from her regular duties as the ruler, Relena opened a school where she can teach her family's beliefs. She would gain three more students: Heero, Quatre Raberba Winner, and Dorothy Catalonia, the granddaughter of Romerfeller head Duke Dermail.</p><p>Despite it being a neutral nation, the Sanc Kingdom would once again be under attack by the Romefeller Foundation, and, despite the best efforts of Noin, Quatre, Heero, and the Maganac Corps, Relena was forced to surrender to Romefeller and dissolved the country. She was then taken into Romefeller custody, and was given an offer to become the new head representative of Romefeller. Relena accepts, taking on the title as the \"Queen of the World\". In her first act, Queen Relena announces the dissolution of all the national borders, and unifies the Earth as the World Nation. Suddenly, she was shocked to learn that Zechs Merquise is the new leader of the colonial rebel faction, White Fang, and that he officially declared war on the World Nation. After the declaration, former Romefeller leader Treize Khushrenada returns, and asks Relena to resign from her position; she accepts, on the condition that she goes to space to personally confront her brother.</p><p>In space, Relena would confront Zechs and try to talk some sense into him, but he would not listen to her, and was instead held captive inside the Libra, White Fang's space station. She would be found by Heero, and again, they confronted Zechs. After that, Relena was sent to the World Nation's asteroid base, MO-2, where she witnessed the final fight between Heero and Zechs.</p><p>At the end of the Eve Wars, Relena becomes the Vice-Foreign Minister of the new Earth-Sphere Unified Nation. On her shuttle, she sees a teddy bear and a card left by a worker. She discovers that the worker was Heero, and after tearing up his card, she smiles at him. Berg mentions that with the Romefeller Foundation being led by \"that Peacecraft girl\", he will have to act independently from now on. She was the mysterious visitor who is listening to Doctor J's story during his imprisonment.</p><p>Relena is now the Vice Foreign Minister for the Earth Sphere Unified Nation, is abducted by Barton Foundation representatives while attending a meeting at the L3 Colony, X-18999. She meets Mariemaia Khushrenada , who is planning to use Relena's influence with the people for her plans to rule the Earth. During the fight against the Mariemaia Army in Brussels, Belgium, Relena admits to Mariemaia that she gave up the Peacecraft name, and explained that what is needed now is the heart to hope for peace, and that hatred would lead to more hatred. After the battle finally ends, Relena once again resumes her duties as the Vice Foreign Minister, starting the Terra Formation Project, which Preventer Agents Zechs and Lucrezia Noin are working on.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Horatio Strong is naturally stronger than most men, but discovered a strange sea weed called \"sauncha \". This gave him even more superhuman strength. He decided to use his powers for good. The sea weed (actually has extraterrestrial origin) had a drug-like effect on him: it gave him \"severe withdrawal pains \" and made him irrational (to a dangerous level). He went on rampage, but was stopped by <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>. After being in a hospital, he swore to never use the sauncha again and use normal vegetables to keep strong. He became a friend of Clark Kent and Superman (not realizing the duo were the same person).</p>",

    "deck": "Kristopher Roderick has a vast wealth, enough to claim any historical tresure. Recently he acquired the memories of a previous life of Hath-Set. He developed a deep hatred for Hawkman and Hawkgirl.",
    "description": "<p>Kristopher Roderic is the latest descendant of Hat-Set and a resident in St. Roch, Louisiana. One of his distant relatives is Matilda Dunney Roderic, who was responsible for the deaths of Cinnamon and Nighthawk (the reincarnated forms of Katar and Shayera Hol) during the Old West. Roderic has worked with Shadow Thief in the past, by stealing antiquties or contending with the Hawks. <br/> <b> <br/>Hawkgirl vs. Hath-Set</b> <br/>Kendra did some digging around at the Stonechat Museum and she came up with a link to Hath-Set and the Valley of the Kings. It turns out Dr. Jeremiah Whetherington Esq. had procured Hath-Set's canopic jar on August 29, 1928 for the antiquities collection at the Gotham Museum of Archaeology . The jar was found in 1922 during an expedition which was led by a Lord Carnarvon. The jar is carbon dated back to the 4th dynasty. Hawkgirl flies to Gotham City and notifies Batman that she is on her way. She passes by Windemere Children's zoo and notices Batman is beating up some thugs so she makes it to the museum first. Kendra is greeted by Hector and Rosie, members of the night staff who instruct Kendra to head to Dr. Ahmose Rassmussen's office.  <br/> <br/>Dr. Rassmussen became in charge of the museum's library after Jonathan Wesley Sandhurst, Director Emeritus past away. Unfortunately for Batman, a mass of people have gone under some kind of hypnosis. Batman figures its Mad Hatter until the mob starts chanting the name Hath-Set. From what Batman could deduce, these people in one way or another come from Hath-Set's bloodline. These people came from all walks of life like Russtoli's, Arlen's gas station and Barrent's preparatory school. The mob began heading to the corner of Bluebird and 19th street where the museum was located. Batman was outmatched so he calls in Superman to do crowd control. <br/> <br/>Some members of the mob come crashing through the museum's atrium and attack the night staff. As for Kendra, her host Dr. Rassmussen fell under Hath-Set's sway and he is transformed into the Bennu, the great Heron of fire as well as divinity, the phoenix of Ancient Egypt and the soul of Ra. Batman and Hawkgirl had their hands full fighting off the mob in the atrium as well as Dr. Rassmussen while Superman was dealing with the chaos outside.  <br/> <br/>A dozen mob members provoke the Man of Steel to the point where he uses his heat vision to disarm them but he didn't realize that they were playing him for a big set up. Superman's heat vision accidently hits a gas main and the entire front side of the museum is engulfed in flames. The atrium eventually catches fire but the sprinkler system kicks in. Hawkgirl activates a small electro shock from her Nth metal mace which stuns everyone in the atrium. Dr. Rassmussen reverts back to his human form and the mob is finally released from Hath-Set's hold because Hath-Set has a back up plan to get Hawkgirl. <br/> <br/>Lt. Chalmers of the fire department puts out Superman's fiery mistake but Superman makes up for it by transporting injured civilians to Elsbeth Memorial Hospital. When Dr. Rassmussen came to, he gave Hawkgirl an encrypted disc with the information she needed. Hawkgirl heads to Oracle's base at Kord Tower and begins a decryption process on the disc. The disc contains the fabled Turin King's list in Ancient Egyptian hieratic. The list was supposedly made at the museum of Turin and it has an inventory of all the pharaohs in every dynasty as well as a map for every royal tomb in Egypt. The list depicts the reign of Khufu and Hath-Set's short term dominion after Khufu's death.  <br/> <br/>All of sudden, the Willy Nelson ring tone on Oracle's cell goes off. The voice on the cell tells Oracle to put this conversation on speaker. Within a few seconds, Hawkgirl realizes that the voice is Kristopher Roderic's. Roderic wants Hawkgirl to meet him at Mug's Pub in Gotham Bay. Hawkgirl arrives at the location and enters the pub. The pub is filled with descendants of Hath-Set and they all point to a door that leads to the back entrance of the bar. Hawkgirl goes through the doorway and the door shuts behind her. Kendra knows this is a trap but she wants to end Hath-Set's curse once an for all. <br/> <br/>For a moment, Hawkgirl was surrounded by complete darkness until the fire from Egyptian torches light up. The light exposes every surrounding in the room. It seems Roderic has designed the room to be a replica or bas-reliefs of a 4th dynasty temple burial chamber. In the middle of the room, there is a Queen's sarcophagus. The sarcophagus has an effigy or raiment of Chay-Ara and next to the tomb is a decorative box of her most precious possessions. Unfortunately, Hawkgirl wasn't alone in the room. Roderic activates a trigger which opens the sarcophagus then he comes up from behind Hawkgirl and shoves her into the tomb which closes in after her. <br/> <br/>Kendra is claustrophobic but Roderic was kind enough to give her Kendra a tank of oxygen for a long trip. Roderic had apparently transformed the inside of a metal container into the burial chamber. The next day, Roderic has the container placed on the Golden Crane, a freighter that is heading toward Egypt. Roderic convinces the harbor master that the manifest of the container has ancient artifacts from Alexandria which he is returning after Western countries looted it when Egypt was under diplomatic anarchy.  <br/> <br/>Roderic knew that Hawkman wouldn't be too far behind since Oracle would have contacted him already. Hawkman reaches the docks a minute too late. Carter interrogates the harbor master and demands to know which ships are heading to Egypt. The harbor master tells Carter that the Golden Crane is going to Alexandria. Meanwhile, Kristopher takes advantage of Hawkgirl's current predicament by trying to rape her. Fortunately, Hawkgirl uses her feminine wiles to lure Roderic into a false sense of comfort then she knocks him into the sarcophagus and locks it up. Roderic bangs and screams in the sarcophagus but his cries for help are muffled by the waves of the Atlantic Ocean. <br/> <br/> The ship arrives in Egypt and the payload is loaded onto a truck convoy. The convoy heads to the Valley of the Kings, the necropolis of pharaohs which is 450 miles south of Alexandria or Cairo and west of the Nile. The convoy heads up the wadi of the valley's basin. The western side of the valley has fewer tombs than the eastern side but according to the Turin King's list, Hath-Set's tomb is located there along with several others. Hawkgirl prays to the goddess Ma'at that she is not too late to stop Hath-Set from rising from the dead. Hawkgirl flies over the valley and notices a dozen men butchered and the convoy is heading to Hath-Set's tomb.  <br/> <br/>The Egyptian descendants of Hath-Set took the convoy and unloaded its contents then they placed it in a temple. One descendant began to chant an incantation which caused the essence of Hath-Set's canopic jar to enter his mummified corpse. Hawkman appears shortly after Hath-Set was resurrected but Carter is captured by the deviant priest when he conjures a sandstorm. The sandstorm sends Hawkman to an underground stockade and Hath-Set begins to gloat over his enemy's defeat. <br/> <br/>It turns out the reason why Hath-Set killed Khufu and Chay-Ara is because Chay-Ara spurned his affections for him. After killing Khufu and Chay-Ara, Hath-Set prayed to Apophis the Destroyer as well as Ammit the Bone Eater in order to exact his curse. The curse would doom Khufu and Chay-Ara to a cycle of tragic reincarnations. Hawkgirl arrives in order to distract Hath-Set long enough for Hawkman to escape. Carter breaks free of his prison and uses a spear to puncture the priest's head then Hawkgirl splits Hath-Set right down the middle with the same Nth metal sword he used to curse Khufu as well as Chay-Ara. Hawkgirl puts her fears about Hath-Set to rest by setting his corpse on fire. With Hath-Set's body no longer mobile, the priest decides to transfer his essence or ka into Kristopher Roderic and break Carter's museum into pieces. <br/> <br/><b>The Curse of the Maw</b> <br/>Roderic almost had Hawkgirl right where he wanted her but then Khimera comes crashing through the room. Khimera has gone ballistic and she charges at Roderic. Both Roderic and Khimera fall into the portal where the Maw resides. Khimera is destroyed for her failure to kill Hawkgirl and as for Roderic, Hath-Set takes over Roderic's body completely and Roderic's essence is wiped out of existence. When Hath-Set arrives at the other end of the portal, he meets Queen Shrike, Chay-Ara's mother.                                    </p>",
