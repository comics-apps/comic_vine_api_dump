    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Henry Lee Lucas was born in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55726\" href=\"/virginia/4020-55726/\">Virginia</a>, the son of an alcoholic father and an alcoholic and abusive mother. The youngest of nine, Lucas' early life was difficult. His mother was physically and sexually abusive, often making the children watch her have sex with clients, and on a number of occasions forcing the young Lucas to wear female clothing. At the age of ten he was accidentally stabbed in the left eye by one of his brothers. The wound was allowed to fester for several days, became infected, and necessitated the removal of the eye, which was replaced by a glass prosthetic. His father died when he was thirteen, and he dropped out of school soon after, fleeing his home and drifting around Virginia. During this time he began to engage in criminal activities and deviant sexual behaviour. His first alleged murder took place in 1951 when he was 15, when he claimed to have murdered a teenage girl who resisted his sexual advances. He was arrested in the summer of 1954 for a number of burglaries and thefts, for which he was sentenced to four years. He served three years before escaping. He was recaptured, and spent two more years in prison, released in early September of 1959. <br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2>After his release he travelled to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56282\" href=\"/michigan/4020-56282/\">Michigan</a> to stay with a half-sister. There, in early 1960, he met his mother, with whom his relationship was not good. He assaulted her in mid January of that year, precipitating her death. He claimed self-defence, but was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to twenty to forty years in prison, of which he served ten before being released. After his release he travelled south, travelling throughout the area and taking various odd jobs. He engaged in a number of relationships, but all of them ended badly, often as a result of his violence and sexual depravity. In 1975 he met Ottis Toole, who shared Lucas' homicidal urges, in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55740\" href=\"/florida/4020-55740/\">Florida</a>. The pair spent some time there, at which point Lucas met Toole's 12-year-old niece Becky Powell, with whom he established a sexual relationship. He and Powell eventually left the area for <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55822\" href=\"/texas/4020-55822/\">Texas</a>, where he found work as a roofer and later caring for an elderly woman. Powell was unhappy in Texas, however, and requested she be allowed to return to Florida. The couple left the employ of the elderly woman, but did not make it far before being taken in at a religious commune, where they spent some time before Becky insisted she be allowed to leave. Lucas agreed and the pair left the commune heading for Florida. Powell was never seen alive again. Lucas returned to the commune, where most people believed the story that Powell had left him. The elderly woman for whom he had worked did not believe the story however, and Lucas killed her. <br /> <br />Lucas was arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm in June of 1983 in Texas. He was held for several days in conditions that he later claimed were inhumane and designed to elicit a confession. He confessed to the murders of Powell and the elderly woman a few days later. He was taken to trial for these murders the fall of that year, and plead guilty, though there was no solid evidence aside from his confessions that tied him to either murder. In open court he alluded for the first time to being responsible for what he claimed was hundreds of murders up and down the country. This confession was seized upon, and numerous police departments began to contact him and the police department holding him. A task force was established to deal with his confessions and to facilitate the closure of cases across the country. On the strength of these confessions a total of 213 murder cases were closed, in addition to one case that had initially been ruled a suicide, though he at some point confessed to or was suspected of over 600 murders. Because of these confessions Lucas enjoyed unprecedented freedoms and comforts in the custody of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56605\" href=\"/texas-rangers/4060-56605/\">Texas Rangers</a>. Around this time the veracity of his confessions came under fire, as a number of his confessions were riddled with incorrect information, or else evidence suggested that it was impossible for him to have committed them. Despite these lingering questions, he was convicted of 189 total murders, one of which resulted in a death sentence. He was held on death row in Texas for several years before his sentence was commuted by the office of then governor <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4660\" href=\"/george-w-bush/4005-4660/\">George W Bush</a> in 1998. He was moved into the prison general population following the commutation, where he spent the remainder of his life. He died of massive heart failure on March 13, 2001. He was 64. <br /><h2>In Other Media</h2>As a notorious serial killer, Henry Lee Lucas has featured in a number of films, television shows and books, many of them documentary or biographical in nature. He appears in a number of documentary films including <i>Acts of Violence</i>, <i>Death Diploma</i>, and <i>Murder by Numbers</i>. He also appears in the television series <i>American Justice</i>, in the episode \"Myth of a Serial Killer\", and in an episode of A&amp;E's <i>Biography</i>. He appears in the 1986 film <i>Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer</i>, where he is played by Michael Rooker, and in the 1996 sequel to that film, <i>Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Part 2</i>, where he is played by Neil Giuntoli. He also appears in the 2009 film <i>Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas</i>, where he is played by Antonio Sabato, Jr. ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Richard Ramirez was born in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55822\" href=\"/texas/4020-55822/\">Texas</a>, the youngest of five children of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55820\" href=\"/mexico/4020-55820/\">Mexican</a> immigrants. He was a friendly and happy child, but suffered from two serious head injuries, once at the age of two and once at the age of five. His father was physically abusive, and as a child he suffered from fairly severe epileptic attacks. In his youth he was heavily influenced by an elder cousin who often told graphic stories of his time in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55927\" href=\"/vietnam/4020-55927/\">Vietnam</a>, and frequently showed the young Ramirez gruesome pictures. At the age of twelve he was present when this same cousin shot his wife, close enough to be splattered by some of her blood. As a teenager he was involved in illegal drugs, as well as petty theft.  <br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2>Ramirez committed his first murder in July of 1984, breaking into the apartment of an elderly woman, stabbing her to death. He left a fingerprint behind at the scene, but it was not then useful in identifying him. He next killed one woman in her house, shooting another in the garage of the house. Only an hour later he attacked another woman, dragging her from her car and shooting her several times. The woman who had been shot in the garage survived, and was able to give a description of him. Ten days later he invaded the home of an elderly couple, shooting the husband and wife and mutilating the wife's corpse post-mortem. He left behind footprints at the scene. He then went a month without killing, before invading the home of another couple in May. He shot the husband, and assaulted and raped the wife, though he did not kill her. This was followed in the end of that month by an invasion of a house belonging to two sisters, both of whom he beat with a hammer, killing one and injuring the other. He also left a number of satanic symbols at the scene, drawing a pentagram in lipstick on the thigh of the deceased victim, as well as on the wall. He committed his next attack the following day, breaking into the house of a middle aged woman and her young son, raping and sodomizing her before tying the mother and son together and leaving both alive. July saw a massive escalation of his actions, killing five and assaulting a further four. In early August he shot a couple in the head, though both survived. Two days later he shot a man and raped the man's life. After this he left the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56019\" href=\"/los-angeles/4020-56019/\">Los Angeles</a> area, where he had been operating up to this point, and travelled to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\" href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\">San Francisco</a>, where he killed a man and assaulted the man's wife. From San Francisco he headed south, breaking into the apartment of a young couple. He killed the man and raped the woman, before fleeing in a car that he had stolen. He was spotted leaving the scene by a teenager, who noted the license plate. When the ditched car was found, a fingerprint was found as well, and Ramirez was finally tied to the killings. Unaware that he had been identified, he left the area via bus, travelling to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55753\" href=\"/arizona/4020-55753/\">Arizona</a>. Upon his return to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55716\" href=\"/california/4020-55716/\">California</a> he was recognized by a number of citizens. He fled the area and attempted to steal a car, but continued to be recognized. He was chased through the streets by an angry mob, who eventually caught and attempted to kill him. He was rescued from the crowd by the police, who took him into custody.  <br />  <br />Ramirez's trial was long and difficult, as many jurors were terrified, especially after one of their number was murdered in an unrelated incident during the trial. He was found guilty of fourteen burglaries, thirteen murders, eleven sexual assaults, and five attempted murders in late September of 1989. In early November of that same year he was sentenced to death. In 1996 he married Doreen Lioy, who had begun contact with him shortly after his arrest. He is currently being held on death row at San Quentin State Prison, awaiting the administration of the death penalty. <br /><h2>In Other Media</h2>As a notorious killer, Ramirez has appeared in a number of films, books and television series, most of them biographical or documentary in nature. He appears in the 1989 television movie <i>Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker</i>, where he is played by Gregory Cruz. He appears in the 2002 direct-to-video <i>Mass Murder</i>, where he is played by Chris Stack. He appears in the 2002 television movie <i>The Night Stalker</i>, played by Omar Alexis, and in the 2002 film <i>Nightstalker</i>, played by Bret Roberts. He also appears in A&amp;E's <i>Biography</i> series, and in <i>The New Detectives: Case Studies in Forensic Science</i>, in the episode \"Fatal Compulsion\" wherein he is played by Mark Hyde",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Judias Buenoano was born in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55822\" href=\"/texas/4020-55822/\">Texas</a>, the daughter of an itinerant farm worker. Her mother died when she was only two, and she and a younger sibling were sent to live with their grandparents. Sometime after she returned to live with her father, now residing in Roswell, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55784\" href=\"/new-mexico/4020-55784/\">New Mexico</a> with his new wife. Buenoano's life with her father and stepmother was extremely unhappy, as she was physically and economically abused. At the age of fifteen she lashed out, scalding two stepbrothers and attacking her father and stepmother. She was sent to jail, where she spent sixty days before being sent to a reform school at her own request. She remained there for a year before returning to Roswell, where she worked as a nurse's aide. In 1961 she gave birth to an illegitimate son, and the following year married an <a data-ref-id=\"4060-44417\" href=\"/us-air-force/4060-44417/\">Air Force</a> officer who adopted the boy. They had another son in 1966, and a daughter the following year. The family moved to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55740\" href=\"/florida/4020-55740/\">Florida</a>, where Buenoano opened a child care centre while her husband was stationed in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55927\" href=\"/vietnam/4020-55927/\">Vietnam</a>. <br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2>Only a few months after her husband's return he fell ill of a then-unidentified affliction, succumbing in mid September of 1971. Buenoano waited only a few days before cashing the three life insurance policies she had on him. Soon after her house burned down, netting another large insurance payout, and she moved to Pensacola. There she met another man with whom she became romantically involved. Around this time her eldest son began to cause problems for Buenoano, and she eventually had him psychologically evaluated and placed in foster care. In 1977 her house in Pensacola burned down, and, after collecting the insurance money and her son from foster care, she moved the family to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55782\" href=\"/colorado/4020-55782/\">Colorado</a> to be with her current lover. In early January of 1978 her lover fell ill, but the cause of the illness was unknown, and he recovered sufficiently in the hospital to be sent back home. He collapsed two days after returning home, and died five days later in hospital. In June of 1978 she returned the family to Florida. In 1979 her eldest son joined the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-44415\" href=\"/us-army/4060-44415/\">army</a>, and began displaying symptoms of poisoning, including paraplegia. He was quickly invalided from the army, and returned home to his mother, now reliant on leg braces and a prosthetic device on one arm. In May of 1980 he went to a lake with his mother and a younger brother. Buenoano rented a canoe and took the children out into the middle of the lake, where the boat tipped. Buenoano and the younger boy made it to shore, but the eldest son drowned, weighed down by the braces and prosthetics. She collected several insurance policies on her son, and though insuring agencies and police became suspicious of her, she was able to collect a great deal of money. Around this time she opened a beauty parlour and became involved with a wealthy man. In October of 1982 she took out a large insurance policy on the man, and by December of that year he began to experience dizziness and vomiting as the result of vitamins she was giving him. Though he noticed the relationship between the vitamins and the sickness, he did not leave Buenoano. In June of 1983 Buenoano planted a car bomb in his car, which went off when he attempted to start the car. He barely survived the attack, which finally drew police attention to Buenoano.  <br /> <br />Her lies began to quickly unravel, and in late July she was arrested. Evidence was found throughout her house and her past, and she was charged with the first degree murder of her son in January of 1984. Her two other victims were exhumed soon after, both found to have arsenic in their systems. Her trial for the murder of her son began in late March of 1984, and was convicted nine days later, receiving a life sentence. At this time she was also convicted for her insurance frauds. In October she went to trial for the attempted murder of her final boyfriend, for which she was convicted after a three-day trial and sentenced to twelve years, served consecutively. Her final trial began in the October of 1985, for the murder of her first husband. The trial lasted a week, after which she was convicted, and in November she was sentenced to death. She was held on death row for several years, before exhausting her appeals. She was executed in the electric chair on March 30th, 1998, the first woman to be executed in Florida since 1848, the third to be executed in the States since 1976, and the first to be executed by electric chair since 1957. She was 54.  <br /><h2>In Other Media</h2>Buenoano appeared in the Discovery Channel's television series <i>Deadly Women</i>, in the episode \"Dark Secrets\"",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Dean Corll was born in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55738\" href=\"/indiana/4020-55738/\">Indiana</a>, the eldest son of a strict father and an overprotective mother. His parents divorced when he was seven, and his father was drafted into the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-44417\" href=\"/us-air-force/4060-44417/\">Air Force</a>. His mother moved the children to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55833\" href=\"/tennessee/4020-55833/\">Tennessee</a> so that they could remain close to their father, and eventually the pair reconciled. Corll was a shy and sickly child, and though compassionate he did not seek out social relationships with others. In 1950 a heart defect due to an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever was diagnosed. That same year his parents remarried, and the family moved to Pasadena, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55822\" href=\"/texas/4020-55822/\">Texas</a>. Three years later, however, they were divorced again. Corll continued to be in the custody of his mother, but remained in contact with his father. Soon after the divorce his mother remarried, and she and her new husband opened a candy shop in the small town in Texas where they now lived. Corll began working there, as well as remaining in school, where he attained fairly good grades, graduating from high school in 1958.  <br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2>After graduation he continued to work for his mother and stepfather, moving along with them to Houston, where they opened a new candy store. Two years later he moved to Indiana, where he lived with his grandparents for a further two years before returning to Texas, working in the candy store and eventually moving in above the shop. By the next year his mother had again divorced, and Corll was given more power in the company, granted the title of vice-president. This was also the first time that allegations against Corll surfaced: a young male employee informed Corll's mother that Corll was making inappropriate sexual advances. These allegations were ignored. He was drafted into the US Army in August of 1964, serving in various forts for the next ten months before applying for and receiving a hardship discharge in June of 1965. He returned to work as the vice-president of the candy company, and around this time the company moved to a location directly across from an elementary school. Corll gained a reputation for giving free candy to the children who attended the school, especially teenage boys. His flirtatious behaviour when it came to young teenage boys began to be noticed. Despite this, many children congregated in the factory, where he had installed a pool table. It was in 1967 that he first became friends with David Brooks, then twelve years old. The pair became very close, eventually developing a sexual relationship at the urging of Corll, who paid Brooks for sex. In 1968 the candy factory closed and his mother moved to another state. Corll took up work as an electrician.  <br /> <br />Corll abducted and killed his first victim in late September of 1970. He picked the 18-year-old up while he was hitchhiking, and later sexually assaulted and asphyxiating him. At some point after this murder he was interrupted while assaulting two boys by Brooks. He was able to buy Brooks' silence with a car, and late offered the boy $200 for each teenage boy he was able to lure to Corll's residence. Brooks took him up on the offer despite being aware that the boys he lured would be killed, and lured two fourteen-year-old boys to Corll in mid December of 1970. Both boys were raped and strangled. This pattern continued into 1971, with a total of six victims being taken that year, and with the notable addition of torture to the modus operandi. In late 1971 Corll met Elmer Wayne Henley, a friend of Brooks' who he ultimately decided would make for a good accomplice. He offered the boy the same rate for luring victims as Brooks; Henley's first abduction probably took place in early February of 1972. Between March and November of that year, Corll abducted, raped, tortured and murdered a further nine boys. In or around late May, Henley began to actively assist in the murder, shooting and strangling victims. He killed his first victim of the new year in February of 1973, taking a five month break before suddenly embarking on a spate of murders between early June and early August that claimed between seven and eight lives.   <br /> <br />On August 7th of 1973, Henley brought a young man to Corll's house with the intention that the teenager should become the next victim. The pair briefly left the house after drinking and huffing paint fumes for several hours, and encountered a fifteen-year-old girl who had left her house due to her abusive father. Henley invited her back to Corll's house. When the trio arrived at Corll's home in the early hours of August 8th, Corll was furious, but eventually calmed down and offered them alcohol and marijuana, watching the three teenagers pass out. The three awoke to find themselves bound hand and foot. Henley was able to talk Corll into releasing him by promising to participate in the torture and murder of the two teenagers tied up in the other room. Corll ordered Henley to rape the girl, while he himself began assaulting the boy. After a brief talk with the girl, Henley suddenly picked up Corll's gun and pointed it at Corll, who taunted Henley by saying he would be unable to pull the trigger, and began to advance on the teenager. In response, Henley shot Corll once in the forehead, then a further three times in the shoulder and twice in the lower back. The impact of the shots sent Corll out into the hallway, where he died. He was 33.  <br /> <br />Corll committed a confirmed total of 28 murders, with speculation that there are more murders that can be attributed to him. Henley and Brooks are currently serving several life sentences.",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Albert DeSalvo was born in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55745\" href=\"/massachusetts/4020-55745/\">Massachusetts</a>, the son of a violent alcoholic who was physically and sexually abusive, beating his wife and often forcing the children to watch him have sex with prostitutes. DeSalvo was a troubled child, and at an early age took to torturing animals and engaging in petty larceny. His first arrest came at the age of twelve, when he was arrested for battery and robbery, and sent to a reform school for a further charge of robbery, from which he was paroled the following year. He was returned to the reform school two years later after stealing a car. Following his release at the age of 17 he joined the army, from which he was honourably discharged. While stationed in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\" href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\">Germany</a> he met a German woman named Irmgard, and married her. He re-enlisted after this first discharge, and was eventually court-martialed. Despite this, he was honourably discharged again. He had returned to America by this point, and continued to have brushes with the law, including a charge for sexually assaulting a child which was eventually dropped. He moved his family to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56311\" href=\"/boston-massachusetts/4020-56311/\">Boston</a> in 1956. <br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2>In Boston he established a ruse in which he posed as a fashion photographer and asked young women to allow him to take their measurements in order to see if they would fit the requirements for a modelling contract. This ruse was fairly successful, and he was able to have sex with a number of his victims; at this point he gained his first nickname: \"The Measuring Man\". He also began breaking and entering, for which he was arrested several times. In 1961 he was arrested again, and gave an unsolicited confession to the Measuring Man assaults. He was ultimately sentenced to eleven months, and released in April of 1962. In mid-June of 1962 the first Boston Strangler murdered occurred, with the sexual assault and strangling of a 55-year-old woman. Between this point and early January of 1964 a further 12 women were murdered in a similar way, most of them sexually assaulted in their homes, strangled with an article of clothing and then posed. The ages of the victims ranged between 19 and 85. After the final known Strangler victim was discovered, DeSalvo began a different series of crimes, becoming a serial rapist identified as \"The Green Man\", dressing as a workman and randomly selecting female victims. Using this ruse he would gain entry to the house of the woman and sexually assault them. He was first identified in relation with these crimes in late October of 1964, and was arrested soon after. After being arrested, he confessed to a number of the Green Man rapes. He was sent to a mental health facility, where he confessed to a cellmate that he was the Boston Strangler. Initially declared competent to stand trial, he began claiming that he was experiencing hallucinations, and was promptly returned to the hospital, where he was declared incompetent. He continued confessing to the cellmate, who alerted his own lawyer. The lawyer asked DeSalvo a series of questions to ascertain his guilt in the case of the stranglings. DeSalvo hoped to translate his involvement to the crimes into fame and wealth. He began confessing to police after receiving a guarantee that the confessions would not be used against him. Despite this, police were unable to connect DeSalvo to the crimes with anything aside from his word. Because of this, he never went to trial, and to this day no one has ever been convicted for the stranglings.  <br /> <br />DeSalvo was tried for the Green Man cases, however, with the trial beginning in January of 1967 and concluding eight days later. He plead not guilty by reason of insanity, but was found to be both sane and guilty. He was sentenced to life in prison. In February of 1967, while awaiting transport to prison, he escaped from the mental hospital along with two other inmates. He made it to the city of Lynn before being recaptured the next day. He was sent to a maximum security prison, then called Walpole, now Cedar Junction. Prison life was not easy for him. He got involved in the production of women's jewelry in order to make money, specializing in chokers. However, he was a walking target among the other inmates, many of whom hated him. He was stabbed to death in his cell on November 25th, 1973 at the age of 42. His murder remains unsolved.<br /><h2>In Other Media</h2>Albert DeSalvo has had a prominent place in popular culture, most of them assuming his guilt for the stranglings. He appears in the highly fictionalized 1968 movie <i>The Boston Strangler</i>, where he is played by Tony Curtis. He also appears in spirit in the episode entitled \"Strangler\" from the the television series <i>American Gothic</i>; he is played by Gareth Williams. A waxwork figure of him comes to life and sings along with a number of other killers in the television series <i>Psychoville</i>, episode \"Joy\". Killings based on the stranglings feature in the 1995 film <i>Copycat</i> and the <i>Rizzoli &amp; Isles</i> episode \"Boston Strangler Redux\". Songs based on or referencing him include \"Midnight Rambler\" by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56045\" href=\"/rolling-stones/4060-56045/\">The Rolling Stones</a>, \"Dedicated to Albert DeSalvo- Sadist and Mass Murderer\" by Whitehouse, \"Boston Strangler\"  by Church of Misery, and \"God Bless\" by Combichrist",

His younger sister was born while his father was fighting in the war; it is possible she was the product of rape, which Chikatilo may have witnessed. The war years marked Chikatilo's first experiences with brutal violence, witnessing the effects of Blitzkrieg, and found himself both terrified and excited by the violence. He was bullied severely by fellow children throughout his childhood and adolescence due to his social awkwardness, especially around girls. He discovered his chronic impotence in his teens, finding he was able to climax only while attacking a young girl. Though an intelligent child, his grades were not sufficiently high to attend university. In 1957 he joined the military, serving for the compulsory three years of military service and leaving in 1960. Three years later he married, having two children between 1965 and 1969. In 1971 he obtained a degree in Russian literature through a correspondence course, and began teaching.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Chikatilo moved to the small town of Shakhty in September of 1978. Two months later he committed his first murder, luring a 9-year-old girl to a house that he had secretly purchased. He attempted to rape her, but found himself unable to do so. She struggled, and he strangled her, then stabbed her numerous times, finding himself able to achieve sexual release only while stabbing her. He became obsessed with this feeling of release, and strongly felt the urge to repeat it. Despite this, he was able to hold off on committing another murder for three years, before committing his second in September of 1981. He beat and strangled the girl, mutilating her postmortem. Also in 1981 he was fired from his job as a teacher due to complaints that he was molesting students of both sexes, and became a supply supervisor. This was followed by another long break, before he committed his third murder in June of 1982, again using a knife to stab and slash the victim to death. After this he began to devolve rapidly, killing six in the six month period between June and the end of the year. At this point he began to finalize his victim type and modus operandi. He approached children of both sexes, generally runaways and vagrants, as well as adult female prostitutes. Most victims were stabbed or slashed to death, though he still occasionally beat or strangled them. Frequently he gouged the eyes of victims. After the glut of killings in 1982, he did not kill again for six months. Once he had begun again, however, he killed five victims in a four month period. During this time, suspicion did not fall on him at all; indeed, another man was convicted and eventually executed for Chikatilo's first murder. By this point, however, police had begun linking the deaths together, and the investigation became intensive. Despite this, Chikatilo committed two more murders by the end of the year. Between January and September of 1984 he killed fifteen more people. He drew police attention to himself for the first time in September of that year when he was seen attempting to lure women away from a bus station. He was found to be in possession of a knife and rope, among other suspicious materials, as well as matching the physical description of the suspect. Despite this, the evidence was not considered sufficient to hold him, and he was released.</p><p>He was later convicted of stealing from his job, however, and was sentenced to a year in prison, of which he served only three months. During his time in prison 23 of his murders were officially attributed to a single killer, and police began to suspect that he had moved out of the area, due to the sudden cessation of the killings. Following his release he did not kill for over seven months, committing another murder at the end of July of 1985, killing again the next month. The investigation into the murders again intensified, with a psychological profile produced and police officers and army officers stationed at train and bus stations. Because of this, Chikatilo did not commit any murders for the whole of 1986. By 1987 he was not able to resist the urge to kill, but was cautious to kill only three times, with each kill occurring outside of the jurisdiction in which the manhunt was ongoing. This was followed by three further murders in 1988, losing the cautiousness that had characterized the previous year, and five further murders in 1989. Nine victims were killed in 1990 before the police developed a snare technique, attempting to funnel the killer to one of the three least-used stations on his typical hunting ground. In early November of 1990, Chikatilo was spotted while leaving the scene of his final murder. An undercover officer noted blood on his cheek, and grass stains on his clothing. The police officer noted his name, and when the body was found a few days later he was placed under surveillance. During the surveillance he was noticed attempting to lure several women and children. He was arrested on November 20th.</p><p>He denied committing the murders for several days, during which he was interrogated by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40823\" href=\"/kgb/4060-40823/\">KGB</a>. Eight days after the interrogation began, the psychologist who had created the initial psychological profile of him was brought in to question him. Two hours later, Chikatilo confessed to 36 of the 38 murders that had to that point been linked to him. He also confessed to a further 20 murders that had to this point gone unconnected to the case. In total he was charged with 53 of the 56 murders to which he had confessed. Chikatilo was found to be mentally competent to stand trial in October of 1991. His trial began on April 14th, 1992. During the trial Chikatilo behaved erratically and inappropriately, exposing himself in the courtroom, shouting, and singing. He recanted his confessions to six of the murders, and requested the judge be removed, as he felt that he was prejudiced against him. Despite his frequent attempts to interrupt the trial, it concluded on August 9th, and he was found guilty of 52 of the 53 murders on October 15th. He was sentenced to death. An appeal and request for clemency were denied. He was executed on February 14th, 1994 by a single shot to the back of the head. He was 57.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p>Chikatilo appears in a number of nonfiction books, as well as a fiction book entitled <i>Child 44</i>. He also appears in the 1995 television movie <i>Citizen X</i>, where he is played by Jeffrey DeMunn. The 2004 film <i>Evilenko</i> is loosely based on the case, with the character based on him played by Malcolm McDowell.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Wayne Williams was born and raised in a Northwestern <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56333\" href=\"/atlanta/4020-56333/\">Atlanta</a> suburb, the son of two teachers who doted on him. He was a fairly intelligent child, and performed well in school. He was fascinated with journalism and radio broadcasting, eventually establishing his own small independent radio station in his parents' backyard at the age of 16, as well as developing an interest in becoming a music producer and promoter. He also became friends with many of the employees of the local radio stations. He attended university for a year, but dropped out. As an adult he found work as a freelance photographer and promoter, and lived with his parents, often spending their money on his quest to find the next big musical group. <br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2>On July 21st, 1979, a young African American boy, aged 14, went missing while on his way home from a skating rink. On the 25th one of the boy's friends, also 14, similarly went missing while on his way to a movie theatre. Both boys' bodies were recovered in a wooded area on the 28th; one had been shot and the other was probably asphyxiated. The next child disappeared on September 4th. Unlike the first two, which had been ruled by the police as drug-related, his death was harder to explain. His body also took longer to recover; he was found in mid-November, by which point another boy had already been abducted. This fourth boy was the first to receive notable media coverage, due to his mother's public pleas for his return. His body was discovered in early November, strangled to death. His discovery incited a measure of public interest in the resolution of the case, though at the time the deaths were not considered connected. There followed a period of inaction on the part of the killer, who did not reemerge until March of the following year. In early March of 1980 the first female victim vanished; she was found six days after she disappeared. She had been asphyxiated like several of the other victims, but her body was displayed in a way unlike the others, tied to a tree with panties in her mouth. The next boy to disappear attracted little police attention, despite allegations from a possible witness about seeing the boy being forced into a blue car, possibly by a white man. There followed an increase in the rate at which the killer operated, as between May and July he killed six more children, including abducting another female victim from her home while her parents slept. The abduction of the female and the possible transportation of the final July victim across state lines, as alleged by a phone call received by a relative of the victim, got the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55443\" href=\"/fbi/4060-55443/\">FBI</a> involved in the case. A further murder occurred in August, with a further four taking place between September and November. January and March saw six more murders, a further escalation, but also a shift in the modus operandi: the victims were getting older. Several adult victims followed, abducted in March and April, all five were over 20 years of age. They were followed in May by another teenaged victim, and the final adult victim, a 29-year-old man.  <br /> <br />Williams first became implicated in the case when he was spotted driving over a bridge and acting in a suspicious manner. Police officers nearby reported hearing a loud splash as he drove over the bridge, as though he had thrown something into the river. He was stopped and questioned, giving false information to the officers. He was given a polygraph test which ended up being inconclusive, which only heightened suspicions, as did the presence of a book on how to defeat polygraph tests in his house. Fibres found in his house were found to be consistent with many fibres found on various victims. Several people who knew Williams claimed that they saw him with scratch marks during the time of the murders that could have been consistent with a struggle, believed to be marks left behind by victims. Williams was arrested in late June for two murders, those of two of the adult victims. Williams maintained his innocence throughout these proceedings. Further polygraphs indicated deception, and Williams' stories about his activities were found to be false. His trial began in early January of 1982, during which many witnesses placed Williams with or near various victims. Williams took the stand in his own defence, but was belligerent on the stand, distancing himself from the jury. The trial ended in late February; Williams was found guilty of both murders and sentenced to two life terms, to be served consecutively. He was later declared to have been conclusively responsible for at least 23 of 29 Williams continues to maintain his innocence, and there has been some controversy about whether or not he was actually responsible for the Atlanta murders. Some argue he was responsible for some but not all, while others believe he committed none. Currently he is held to have been responsible for most if not all, but investigation is ongoing. <br /><h2>In Other Media</h2>Wayne Williams has received a great deal of media attention, mostly documentary or biographical in nature. The 1985 television mini-series <i>The Atlanta Child Murders</i> features a sensationalized version of Williams' story, with Williams portrayed by Calvin Levels. He appears in the conspiracy-centric television movie <i>Who Killed Atlanta's Children?</i> wherein he is played by Cle Bennett. Williams himself appears in a CNN documentary, <i>The Atlanta Child Murders</i>.  ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin  </h2>Aileen Wuornos was born in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56282\" href=\"/michigan/4020-56282/\">Michigan</a>, the daughter of a divorced mother and a father who had been imprisoned for sex crimes against children at the time of her birth. In early 1960, when Wuornos was four, her mother abandoned her and her elder brother, leaving them in the care of their maternal grandparents. Wuornos' life was not happy with her grandparents. From an early age she was sexually and physically abused by her grandfather, an alcoholic. By the age of eleven she was engaging in sexual activity with fellow students in exchange for various items, including food and cigarettes, as well as engaging in a sexual relationship with her brother. She often ran away for brief periods of time, before eventually being returned home. At fourteen she was raped by an older man, and impregnated. Her child was given up for adoption, and she dropped out of school a few months later. Her grandmother died around this time, and by fifteen she had been thrown out of her childhood home. She turned to prostitution to support herself, and lived a mostly transient life in the woods around her childhood home.   <br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2>Wuronos' first criminal charges came three years later, when she was charged with a variety of crimes in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55782\" href=\"/colorado/4020-55782/\">Colorado</a>. Two years later she was in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55740\" href=\"/florida/4020-55740/\">Florida</a>, where she met a fairly wealthy man almost fifty years her senior. The pair soon married, but their marriage was troubled, as Wuornos was volatile and occasionally violent, hitting her new husband with his own cane and eventually getting herself jailed for assault. Her husband filed a restraining order against her, and when she was released from prison she returned to Michigan, where she was again arrested for her violent behaviour. Her brother died around this time, leaving her $10,000. Her marriage was officially annulled at this time. In 1978 she attempted suicide by shooting herself in the abdomen. By 1981 she had returned to Florida, where she robbed a convenience store with a gun. For this, she was sentenced to three years in prison, of which she served only about a year. Over the next three years she continued to commit a series of petty crimes. It was around this time that she met Tyria Moore at a gay bar in Florida. The pair instantly became inseparable, and began living together, mostly as transients. Wuornos supported both of them with prostitution, while Moore worked as an occasional motel maid. Though happy with Moore, Wuornos was unable to control her violent tempers and addictions.  <br />  <br />In late November of 1989 Wuornos committed her first murder, killing a man who had picked her up. She shot him several times and dumped his body in a wooded area, later claiming that she had killed him in self-defence. After the murder she returned home to Moore, who she immediately confessed to; Moore later claimed that she did not believe the confession. She did not commit another murder until May of 1990, and between then time and November of that same year she killed a further six men. Each time her modus operandi was similar: she would pick a man up either while acting as a prostitute, a hitchhiker, or pretending to be a stranded motorist. She would then shoot the man, often several more times than necessary, and take all of his money, and occasionally small, pawnable items. Police suspicion first fell on her in early July, when she and Moore were spotted dumping the car of one of the victims. Her place as prime suspect was strengthened by the location of a number of items belonging to the victims that had been pawned by her, as well as her fingerprints being found in the abandoned cars. Wuornos was arrested in early January 1991. She confessed to the murders a week after being arrested, following intense prompting from Moore, who was asked by police to convince Wuornos to confess.  <br /><br />Wurnos' trial for the murder of her first victim began in early January of 1992. She plead self-defence, claiming that the victim had raped and tortured her. She took the stand in her own defence, but alienated the jury with her violent temper. Just over a week after the trial began, Wuornos was found guilty of first-degree murder. In late March of 1992 she plead no contest to three of the murders, and guilty to the final two in June of 1992 and February of 1993; she was not tried for the fourth murder, as his body was never found. She received death sentences for all six of the murders for which she was tried. She later recanted her claims that all of the victims had raped her, though claimed until her death that the first had. In 2001 Wuornos, who had grown weary of life on death row, petitioned the court for the right to forgo her automatic appeals and be allowed to die. She was judged mentally fit to be executed, and her request was granted, with a date for her execution set for October of 2002. In her final year of life she complained of poor treatment by prison staff, and in the months leading up to her death she began to make increasingly paranoid assertions about \"sonic pressure\" being used to make her appear crazy. Aileen Wuornos was executed by lethal injection on October 9th, 2002. She was 46. <br /><h2>In Other Media</h2>As one of the most infamous serial killers in recent memory, Aileen Wuornos has featured in a number of books, films and television series, most of them biographical or documentary in nature. Two documentaries, <i>Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer</i> and <i>Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer</i>, were directed by Nick Broomfield, who interviewed Aileen extensively while she was in prison. In the 1992 TV movie <i>Overkill: The Aileen Wuornos Story</i> she is played by Jean Smart. In the 2003 film <i>Monster</i> she is played by Charlize Theron. She has also featured in A&amp;E's <i>Biography</i> series, and in an episode of the Discovery Channel's <i>Deadly Women</i> series, in the episode entitled \"Predators\". An opera based on her life, entitled <i>Wuornos</i>, premiered in 2001. A book about her, entitled <i>Lethal Intent</i>, was released in 2002. ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Charles Starkweather was born in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55757\" href=\"/nebraska/4020-55757/\">Nebraska</a>, the son of a respected working class family. His family life was good, but his school life was difficult; he had a mild congenital defect that misshaped his legs, as well as a speech impediment, both of which drew the bullying of fellow students. He also suffered from severe myopia that went undiagnosed for most of his early life, and had a major effect on his ability to learn in class, which frustrated him. In high school he became much more troubled, and began to bully other students using his physical strength. Around this time he also developed an obsession with actor <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3938\" href=\"/james-dean/4005-3938/\">James Dean</a>, connecting to his portrayal of a disaffected teenager in the film <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>, he began to emulate Dean in action and dress. At eighteen he met the 13-year-old Caril Ann Fugate, with whom he became infatuated. He dropped out of school and sought employment at a warehouse near her school so he could visit her after school. He was thrown out of his family home after allowing Fugate to drive his father's car, which she crashed into another car. He then quit his job at the warehouse and took work as a garbage collector. During this time he began to develop a nihilistic view of life, frequently expressing the view that dead people were all equals.<br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2>At the end of November 1957 he attempted to purchase a gift for Fugate from a gas station. The attendant refused to allow him to buy the toy on credit, enraging Starkweather, who left. He returned the following day in possession of a shotgun and entered the store twice, each time purchasing a small item before leaving. He returned to the store a third time and held the attendant at gunpoint, obtaining $100 from the register before forcing him into his car and driving him to a remote area. There, after a brief scuffle during which the attendant was accidentally shot in the knees, he shot him in the head, killing him. He went to Fugate and confessed his crime, though claimed that someone else had killed the attendant. She did not believe him, suspecting he had shot the attendan, but remained in a relationship with him nonetheless. Just under two months later, in late January of 1958, Starkweather went to visit Fugate. Finding her not at home, he instead encountered her mother and stepfather, who ordered him to stay away from Fugate. Enraged, he shot both, then strangled and stabbed Fugate's two-year-old half-sister. Fugate returned home to find her family slaughtered, and assisted Starkweather in hiding the bodies, then wrote a note advising visitors to the house that they should not enter because the occupants of the house had the \"flue.\" They remained in the house for seven days, fleeing ahead of the arrival of the police, contacted by Fugate's grandmother. The pair fled to the farmhouse of a family friend, who was shot by Starkweather, later claiming self defence for the otherwise apparently motiveless killing. The pair then left the farmhouse, and were soon forced to abandon their vehicle after driving it into mud. They were picked up by two teenagers, who they forced to drive to a secluded location and shot, with Starkweather claiming he killed the boy while Fugate shot the girl. They stole the couple's car, and drove to a wealthy area in their hometown of Lincoln. There, they entered the home of a wealthy businessman, where they found the man's wife and maid. Starkweather later claimed that Fugate was responsible for stabbing both women to death, though he admitted to shooting the businessman when he arrived home. After killing the man, they stole some jewelry and his car, fleeing the state and travelling to Wyoming. Needing to ditch the car, as it was too flashy, they spotted a travelling salesman sleeping in his car. Rousing him, they then killed him, with Starkweather claiming that Fugate delivered the killing blow, and stole his car. However, the car had a push-pedal brake, and as they attempted to drive away Starkweather, unfamiliar with it, accidentally stalled the vehicle. While attempting to restart the vehicle he was approached by a passerby who offered to help. Starkweather threatened the man with the rifle, and the pair struggled, which was put to a stop by the arrival of a deputy sheriff. At this point Fugate fled the car, calling for assistance. Starkweather fled from police in the businessman's car, but gave himself up after the back window was shattered by a bullet and he believed he had been shot, when in fact he had been wounded by the glass from the window.  <br /> <br />Immediately after his arrest, Starkweather claimed that Fugate had been a hostage, and had been an unwilling accomplice. However, in the time leading up to his trial he modified his account greatly, eventually claiming that she was totally complicit, and had committed some of the murders. Starkweather was only charged with one murder out of the eleven total committed during the spree. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was executed by electric chair in the early hours of June 25th, 1959. He was 20-years-old. <br /><h2>In Other Media</h2>Starkweather's case has been extremely influential in pop culture. Notable films based on the case include <i>The Sadist</i>, <i>Badlands</i> and <i>Natural Born Killers</i>, while films explicitly featuring his case include <i>Starkweather</i>, where he is played by Brent Taylor, and the TV movie <i>Murder in the Heartlands</i>, where he is played by Tim Roth. His story was also the basis for an episode of the television series <i>Criminal Minds</i>, entitled \"The Thirteenth Step.\" He appears in the books <i>Outside Valentine</i> and <i>Not Comin' Home to You</i>, as well as having several characters based on him throughout the works of <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41925\" href=\"/stephen-king/4040-41925/\">Stephen King</a>. He is the central character of the song \"Nebraska\" by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58789\" href=\"/bruce-springsteen/4005-58789/\">Bruce Springsteen</a> and the song \"Badlands\" by Church of Misery. ",

After both Sinestro and <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a> travel to the enslaved planet with a plan to free Sinestro's people, Sinestro observes a young woman stand up to her slavers. This woman is Arsona, a former officer under Sinestro while he was a Green Lantern for the first time, shows no fear standing up to Sinestro's former Corps. Seeing that her life is in danger, a normally calm and collected Sinestro abandons his plan, and charges in head first to save her. This eventually leads to both he and Hal being captured, and thrown into prison, while the Sinestro Corps figures out what to do with them. In a cell with his people, Sinestro is berated by Arsona about what he did to her people. In an effort to help them liberate themselves, Sinestro manages to create multiple Green Power Rings for the Korugarians, but under Arsona's lead, they attempt to turn the rings on Sinestro for revenge. Despite learning that the rings Sinestro created won't harm him, Arsona still tries as hard as she can to kill Sinestro with a blast from the ring, not leaving a scratch on him. Defeated, Arsona is brought to tears in the wake of still being powerless against her former dictator. Sinestro then convinces the Arsona to help him free Korugar. This time she helps using her new Green Lantern ring to make enough of a distraction for Sinestro and Hal Jordon to shut down the <a href=\"/sinestro-corps-power-battery/4055-55901/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55901\">Sinestro Corps Power Battery</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Nowhere Man, or Mason, is the product of his parents attempt at creating a baby that the Omnimind could not read. Mason's father changed his mother's DNA so that she would bear a child that would be immune to the virus that connects everyone to the Omnimind.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Nowhere Man is the creation of writer <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42339\" href=\"/marc-guggenheim/4040-42339/\" slug=\"marc-guggenheim\">Marc Guggenheim</a> and artist <a data-ref-id=\"4040-56313\" href=\"/jeevan-kang/4040-56313/\" slug=\"jeevan-kang\">Jeevan J. Kang</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h4>Chapter One</h4><p>Nowhere Man/Mason is born on the island of Montag which is a location known as, \"the Omnimind's blind spot\". The people on this island are free to think whatever they want without fear of the Omnimind listening in to their thoughts. Mason's parents developed a way to give birth to a baby that does not contract the Omnimind virus. Nowhere Man lacks the signature facial tattoo that surrounds the right eye of all those under the influence of the Omnimind virus (although he puts fake patterns on his face so as not to alert anyone). These lines on their face act as an antenna that transmits the thoughts of the individual to the Omnimind.</p><p>After Mason is born, his father puts him through a rigorous training regimen to toughen and strengthen him. Mason learns at a young age, through cartoons, the purpose of the Omnimind and how it sacrifices a persons privacy for their own protection. The final test that Mason must pass is to make sure that he is actually immune to the Omnimind virus. In order to do this, Mason and his father boat out, past the confines of Montag, and Mason's father asks him to kill him. Mason's father longs to be with his wife again so it only made sense to him that the test be done this way. If Mason is under the influence of the Omnimind, it would sense the attempt at murder and prevent it. If Mason was free of the Omnimind's influence, nothing would happen. Mason strangled his father to death thus showing that he was immune to the Omnimind virus.</p><p>Mason travels to the city and meets a group of arms dealers that he hopes to purchase a bomb from. These dealers eat pain pills like they are candy because it creates static that makes it hard for the Omnimind to read them. They are suspicious of Mason and believe him to be working for Orion. One of these thugs spits on Mason and manages to smear his fake line patterns. Omnimind immediately alerts authorities that homicidal thoughts are being registered. Before they could arrive on the scene, Mason had killed the thug in self defense while plunging to the ground from the high rise building they were in.</p>",

He reveals that he seeks the blood in order to prolong his life long enough to seek out the member of their family who is attempting to use arcane means to take over the world. Shade sets off to acquire the blood for him, but Caldecott dies before Shade can locate a viable sample.  <br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Caldecott has no known superhuman powers or abilities. He is of above average intelligence, possessing a keen business and industrial sense, as well as being notably charismatic.  ",

    "deck": "Blake was a Sub-Commander within AIM, tasked to retrieve an unknown weapon --Headpool-- from the Savage Lands. Following Deadpool into the Zombiverse to retrieve the \"weapon\", Blake was infected and tossed out of a helicopter by A.I.M. Agent Ashcroft.",
    "description": "<p>After receiving word, from one of their spies, that <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\" href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" slug=\"hydra\">Hydra</a> had made a discovery in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\" href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" slug=\"savage-land\">Savage Land</a> so significant a heavily armed Hydra retrieval team was sent in, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\" href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" slug=\"aim\">A.I.M.</a> placed Sub-Commander Blake in charge of the operation to get the possible weapon before Hydra could. While the A.I.M. double agent --<a data-ref-id=\"4005-5179\" href=\"/dr-betty/4005-5179/\" slug=\"dr-betty\">Dr.Betty Swanson</a>-- kept tabs on Hydra's big find, Blake decided to hire <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\" href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" slug=\"deadpool\">Deadpool</a> to drop into the Savage Lands from an A.I.M. orbiting station, find the possible Hydra weapon and return with it.</p><p>While Blake waited in the orbiting station (while drinking plenty of whiskey), he was informed that Dr. Swanson had missed her check-in and that he might want to assume the worst. Mulling it over, he orders his men the initiate \"The Prometheus Option\"; to lock onto the signal from Betty's watch and fire on it from space, so insure Hydra wouldn't have the weapon instead.</p><p>Deadpool and Dr. Swanson managed to survive and returned to the station aboard a Hydra Shuttle, with the weapon in hand; Deadpool's zombified head from an alternate Earth. Everything seemed to be finished, when the station was attacked by a Hydra shuttle. During the chaos, Deadpool stole his zombie head --<a data-ref-id=\"4005-33654\" href=\"/zombie-deadpool/4005-33654/\" slug=\"zombie-deadpool\">Headpool</a>-- grabbed Dr. Swanson and forced <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45559\" href=\"/bob-agent-of-hydra/4005-45559/\" slug=\"bob-agent-of-hydra\">A.I.M. Agent Bill/Bob</a> to fly them away from the station before it exploded.</p><p>Blake managed to survive in the remains of the station. With most of his men dead, he assembled a small strike team and chased after Deadpool. Blake and his team found Deadpool, Dr. Swanson and Bill/Bob in front of a dimensional portal, as they talked with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10280\" href=\"/brother-voodoo/4005-10280/\" slug=\"brother-voodoo\">The Sorcerer Supreme</a>; who aligned the portal to take them to Headpool's Earth. However, the portal wouldn't remain open for long.</p><p>Blake waited for them to enter the portal, before shortly following after. They eventually found Deadpool... as he was fighting three zombified villains. All of Blake's men, save one, were eaten as he escaped. Blake and his last remaining agent trekked through the wastes of the Zombiverse, until they came across Deadpool yet again. After stealing Deadpool's helicopter, Blake made a deal: a ride for safe passage back through the portal; to which Deadpool agreed.</p><p>On the way, they stopped at the ruins of an airport for fuel. While Deadpool and Dr. Swanson were off chatting, Blake distracted Bill/Bob while his agent hit him over the head with a shovel. Blake then called out that a Zombie posse was closing in, to which Deadpool and Dr. Swanson went charging for a fight. Blake took his chance and snatched Headpool and took off in the helicopter. They didn't get far, before Headpool bit Blakes finger off; infecting him with the zombie virus. Headpool told him that if he wanted to live, he'd go back and get an anti-viral serum Deadpool had obtained.</p><p>Obviously, Blake returned and pleaded for the serum. Though Dr. Swanson and Bill/Bob protested, Deadpool gave Blake the serum and they continued to make their way to the portal. During the flight, Blake began to feel sick and began to change into a zombie. Deadpool revealed that he actually wanted to see how long it took to turn after being bitten. When Blake asked him what he drank, Deadpool also reveals that he had way too much to drink and really had to go.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83730/2158575-sub_commander_blake_4_zombie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158575\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.7013782542113\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:170.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83730/2158575-sub_commander_blake_4_zombie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158575\"><img alt=\"Pushed to his death\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83730/2158575-sub_commander_blake_4_zombie.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83730/2158575-sub_commander_blake_4_zombie.jpg 1306w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83730/2158575-sub_commander_blake_4_zombie.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83730/2158575-sub_commander_blake_4_zombie.jpg 564w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" data-width=\"564\"></a><figcaption>Pushed to his death</figcaption></figure><p>As Blake cursed Deadpool and threatened how he was going to eat him, A.I.M. agent <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84722\" href=\"/ashcroft/4005-84722/\" slug=\"ashcroft\">Ashcroft</a> --who'd been with Blake since the beginning-- pushed him out of the helicopter to his death.</p>",

This drew the attention of both Blockbuster and <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Nightwing</a>.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Margot and her sister <a href=\"/aliki-marceau/4005-81958/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81958\">Aliki </a>are acrobats from <a href=\"/france/4020-55778/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\">France</a> and at one point were the featured performers of Cirque Sensationnel.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Her first appearance was in <a href=\"/nightwing/4050-5755/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5755\">Nightwing</a> #32 in 1999. She was created by <a href=\"/chuck-dixon/4040-41486/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41486\">Chuck Dixon</a> and <a href=\"/scott-mcdaniel/4040-2218/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2218\">Scott McDaniel</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>As the older of the two, Margot is the de facto leader of their small group. She generally provides the leadership for the two and allows them to stay focused on their jobs.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>The first appearance of the sisters was in <a href=\"/bludhaven/4020-55771/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55771\">Bludhaven</a>, having chosen to go up against the criminal operation of <a href=\"/blockbuster/4005-8263/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8263\">Blockbuster</a> for their scores. This drew the attention of both Blockbuster and <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Nightwing</a>. They would later join <a href=\"/alex-luthor/4005-24087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24087\">Alexander Luthor</a>’s <a href=\"/secret-society-of-super-villains/4060-40433/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40433\">Secret Society of Super Villains</a>. They were also later recruited by <a href=\"/cheshire/4005-2537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2537\">Cheshire</a> to help destroy the <a href=\"/secret-six/4060-38149/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-38149\">Secret Six</a>. They were initially able to subdue <a href=\"/deadshot/4005-5763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5763\">Deadshot</a>, but were later almost killed by him, although he decided not to kill them as his daughter was present.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As with most of the <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham</a> based characters, the two have no super powers. They are extremely skilled acrobats and gymnasts though, and their ability in these fields also transfer well to hand-to-hand combat and thievery.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Animation</h3><h4>DC Super Hero Girls</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5740779-double+dare.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5740779\" data-ratio=\"0.6138147566719\" data-width=\"637\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 637px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.4%\" href=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5740779-double+dare.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5740779\"><img alt=\"Double Dare Twins in DC Super Hero Girls\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5740779-double+dare.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5740779-double+dare.jpg 637w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/5740779-double+dare.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5740779-double+dare.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Double Dare Twins in DC Super Hero Girls</figcaption></figure><p>The Double Dare twins make their debut in Episode 9 of Season 2 \"Doubles Trouble\", fighting Katana and Supergirl.
