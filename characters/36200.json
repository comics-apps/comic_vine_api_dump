    "description": "<p>Joseph Chandler was born c. 1850. He was originally a carman, but joined <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56630\" href=\"/scotland-yard/4060-56630/\" slug=\"scotland-yard\">Scotland Yard</a> in 1873. By 1888 he was an Inspector for the Metropolitan Police serving in H division. On the morning of September 8th, 1888 he arrived in Hanbury Street where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62794\" href=\"/annie-chapman/4005-62794/\" slug=\"annie-chapman\">Annie Chapman</a> lay murdered. He had been standing at the corner of Hanbury Street and Commercial Street at about 6:10 that morning, when several men ran by him heading away from Hanbury Street and told him another murder had been committed. He arrived at the scene at about 6:13, alerted Scotland Yard, called for reinforcements and the Divisional Surgeon, Dr. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62946\" href=\"/george-bagster-phillips/4005-62946/\" slug=\"george-bagster-phillips\">George Bagster Phillips</a>, and covered the body with loose sacking. At about 6:40 after the body had been examined and was being removed, Chandler and Phillips searched the yard, discovering the contents of her pockets which had apparently been arranged purposefully, as well as a torn envelope bearing the seal of the Royal Sussex Regiment, among other things. At about 6:45 he was involved in interviewing at least one witness, John Richardson. At about 7:02 he arrived at the mortuary, took a description of the deceased's clothing and departed again. On September 13th he testified at the inquest into her murder. In 1892 he was demoted to Sergeant because he was found drunk on duty. He retired in 1898. In 1901 he was employed as a Watcher for a commercial employer, HM Customs. <br/> <br/>In 1874 he married Martha Harris, with whom he would have 5 children, the last of whom was born in 1892.  He died in 1923 at the age of 73.   </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>George Bagster Phillips was born c. 1834. He was trained in medicine, midwifery and apothecary, and in 1861 became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He was noted as a kind and charming man, well-liked by the public and by colleagues. He was also described as modest and an efficient and skilled doctor.<br/> <br/>In 1865 he was police surgeon for the H division of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56630\" href=\"/scotland-yard/4060-56630/\" slug=\"scotland-yard\">Scotland Yard</a>, which covered <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a>, the district of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> in which he lived. During the early years of his involvement with the police he covered a number of assault and sexual assault cases <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Jack the Ripper </h3>Early in the morning on September 8th, 1888 Phillips was called to Hanbury Street in Whitechapel, where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62794\" href=\"/annie-chapman/4005-62794/\" slug=\"annie-chapman\">Annie Chapman's</a> body had been found. He examined the body as it laid at the scene of the crime, and several hours later at the postmortem. He claimed the time of death was some time around 4:30, though this was contradicted by eyewitness testimony. He diagnosed her as suffering from tuberculosis at the time of her death, explaining her claims of illness in the days leading up to her death. He was the first to suggest that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> might have some surgical skill or else anatomical knowledge. <br/> <br/>He was next called to Dutfield's Yard in the early hours of September 30th, 1888, where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62791\" href=\"/elizabeth-stride/4005-62791/\" slug=\"elizabeth-stride\">Elizabeth Stride's</a> body lay with her throat cut. He examined the body where it lay and was involved in the postmortem examination. He also took part in the postmortem examination of the murder of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62819\" href=\"/catherine-eddowes/4005-62819/\" slug=\"catherine-eddowes\">Catherine Eddowes</a>, although she had died outside of his jurisdiction, within the district of the City of London. He was invited to join in the examination because of his familiarity with Jack the Ripper's crimes.  <br/> <br/>On November 9th, 1888 he was involved in the postmortem examination of final Ripper victim <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30941\" href=\"/mary-kelly/4005-30941/\" slug=\"mary-kelly\">Mary Jane Kelly</a>. At the inquest into her murder he presented only the basic information in the case, as the verdict was passed before he had to present the more detailed descriptions of her wounds. The passing of the verdict before all information was presented meant that there is continued debate over the exact time of Kelly's murder.  <br/><h3>After the Ripper </h3>In the years immediately following the Ripper murders, Phillips was involved in the investigations into the deaths of a number of alleged Ripper victims. The first such was the July 1889 murder of Alice McKenzie, who had had her throat cut by someone who Phillips believed had some knowledge of how to kill someone swiftly. He did not believe this person was the Ripper. The second was the Pinchin Street Murder, in which a headless and legless torso was found in September of 1889. Phillips did not believe this murder was attributable to the Ripper. The third was Frances Cole, who was murdered in February of 1891. He did not believe this murderer to be the Ripper.  <br/> <br/>Phillips died of apoplexy on October 27th, 1897. He was 63.",

He, along with Detective Sergeant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62810\" href=\"/william-thick/4005-62810/\" slug=\"william-thick\">Thick</a> and other police officers, was among the first to respond to the scene of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62794\" href=\"/annie-chapman/4005-62794/\" slug=\"annie-chapman\">Annie Chapman's</a> murder at 29 Hanbury Street. They arrived at the scene around 7:00 on the morning of September 8th, 1888.  <br/>  <br/>The only other mention of him in official documents is from a year later, when he was involved in the apprehension of a fraudster, Edwin Smith. He appeared in the Old Bailey to give testimony on the matter on the 4th of February, 1889. No other documentation exists of his life. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Joseph Barnett was born c. 1858 and raise less than a mile from the heart of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a>. His father died in 1864, when Joe was six, and his mother abandoned the children soon after, leaving the eldest children to take care of themselves. By 1878 Joe and his three brothers were all working as fish porters at Billingsgate Market, a job which their father had held before them.  <br/> <br/>In April of 1887 he met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30941\" href=\"/mary-kelly/4005-30941/\" slug=\"mary-kelly\">Mary Jane Kelly</a> for the first time, and the following day they decided to move in together. Much of what is known about Kelly was told by Barnett to police after her death. In 1888 they took a room together at 13 Miller's Court. In July of 1888 Barnett lost his job a Billingsgate, ostensibly because he was caught stealing. On October 30th he and Kelly quarreled, and he left the room they shared. He claimed that this fight was because a prostitute, known to him only by the name <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62954\" href=\"/julia-of-13-millers-court/4005-62954/\" slug=\"julia-of-13-millers-court\">Julia</a>, was sharing the room at the time. It was probably at this time that the window next to the door was broken. After this fight he took lodgings in Bishopsgate, but continued to visit Kelly between the 1st and the 8th of November, sometimes giving her money. He left her room for the last time at 8 p.m. on November 8th. Her body was found mutilated in the room at 10:45 the next morning.  <br/> <br/>After the murder Barnett was interrogated for four hours, after which the police seemed satisfied that he was not the killer. It was not suggested that he was a suspect again until almost a century later, when author Bruce Paley first suggested that Barnett was jealous of Kelly and committed the other four murders in the hopes of scaring her out of prostitution, and when this failed, murdering her. Other suggest that he only killed Kelly and mutilated her in order to tie the crime in with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a>, though of the two suggestions this seems the less likely. Though Barnett does seem to have similarities to some of the descriptions of the killer, and matches some aspects of the profile created by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55443\" href=\"/fbi/4060-55443/\" slug=\"fbi\">FBI</a> a century after the crimes, it must be remembered that Barnett was exonerated by contemporary investigation, and appears to have had an alibi for the night of Kelly's murder.</p>",

He worked as a labourer and occasionally in the markets, mainly as a fruit seller. In 1881 he lived at Cooney Street Lodging House, which is where he met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62819\" href=\"/catherine-eddowes/4005-62819/\" slug=\"catherine-eddowes\">Catherine Eddowes</a>. He claimed that he had never known her to act as a prostitute. He himself was noted as suffering from a cough and kidney problems, but to be a kind man of pleasant demeanour. In late September he and Eddowes went to Kent to take work as casual hop pickers, which they often did in the summer. They returned to London on the 28th. As the crop had been bad, they pawned his boots and took beds in separate casual wards, he on Shoe Lane and she in Mile End. They met up again the next day and spent the money obtained from the sale of the boots on food, then parted at around 2 p.m., when Eddowes told him she was planning on travelling to Bermondsey to see her daughter. She was supposed to meet with him again at 4 p.m., but did not show up. He was unconcerned, as he expected her to return to the lodging house later that night. He heard from friends that she had been brought to Bishopsgate station because she was drunk. He was unsure how she had gotten money for the drink, but knew she was occasionally in the habit of drinking too much.  <br/> <br/>He identified her body after learning of the pawn tickets that had been found under her body which identified her as \"Emily Birrel\" and \"Jane Kelly\". He also attended her funeral, which was held on October 8th, 1888. On November 29th, 1888, he was admitted to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a> Workhouse Infirmary to be treated for laryngitis. There is no known further record of him. </p>",

    "deck": "A witness at the inquest into the murder of Elizabeth Stride, and her lover",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Michael Kidney was born c. 1852. He worked as a dock labourer, and lived in Commercial Street. He met Elizabeth Stride around 1885, and the pair lived together for  most of the next three years, though their relationship was quite on-and-off. He also believed she was younger than she actually was, giving her age as between 36 and 38, and believed the story that her husband and some of her children had died in the Princess Alice disaster on the Thames. His relationship with Stride was reportedly quite volatile, as she often went missing for long periods of time due to her drinking, which he claimed totalled about 5 months in the 3 years they spent together. It is probable that their relationship occasionally included violence, as in April of 1887 she charged him with assault. However, she failed to appear in court and the charges were dismissed. Shortly before the murder, in July of 1888 he was sent to prison for three days on charges of being drunk and disorderly, and using obscene language. <br/><br/>He last saw Stride on September 25th, 1888, five days before she died. He claimed they parted on good terms, and she seemed to be sober. He went to work and when he returned she was no longer there. He was not particularly concerned, as she often vanished, and he did not believe she was seeing another man because she liked him best. The day after her murder he got drunk and went to the police station on Leman Street, claiming that if he had been a police officer on the beat where her body was discovered he would have killed himself, and also that he would be able to catch the killer if he was given access to some men, who he would place strategically to catch Jack the Ripper in the act. He did not elaborate further, and had no other information to give. He identified her body in the morgue, and later appeared at the inquest where he testified about the last time he saw Stride.     <br/> <br/>In June of 1889 he was admitted to Whitechapel Workhouse Infirmary to be treated for syphilis. He was admitted again in August for lumbago, and in October for dyspepsia. No further records exist of his life.   <br/><h3>Murderer? </h3>Kidney has been proposed as a suspect in the murder of Stride. Some have suggested that Kidney killed Stride because of a drunken lover's quarrel, citing the marked differences between her murder and those of the other victims, most notably the lack of strangulation and of mutilation. It is then supposed that he simply allowed the murder to be lumped in with the other five. The differences between the murders are cited as the reason why he is not a suspect for the Ripper murders as a whole, since it wouldn't make sense for him to vary his modus operandi so wildly. ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>William Morris was born in 1834, the son of a bill broker from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a>. He was a studious and intelligent child, learning to read well before many of his peers. Though he was delicate in his early life, a move to Woodford Hall when he was 6 gave him numerous opportunities to explore the outdoors. During his time there he became an avid bird watcher. He was taught at home by a governess until he was 9, at which point he was sent to school at Walthamstow. In 1847 Morris' father died, leaving the family well-off, but causing them to leave their home in Woodford Hall for smaller accommodations. Thus they moved to Water House, and Morris began schooling at Marlborough School, where he remained for the next three years. He made slow progress at the school, where his main interest was personal study of architecture, and in 1851 he was sent to live as a pupil with a reverend. He remained there for a year as he prepared for university.  <br/><h2>Character Evolution</h2>In 1852 he matriculated to Exeter College, Oxford. There he met Edward Burne-Jones, with whom he would form a close personal and working relationship. He also became a member of a group known as the \"Brotherhood\" or the \"Pembroke set\", who studied ecclesiastical history and theology together, as well as art and medieval poetry. Morris himself was heavily influenced by the pre-Raphaelite school of art, and also by the growing movement that rejected machine-created works in favour of hand-crafted works. He and Burne-Jones had both intended to become involved in the church, but as they investigated these new ideas they began to turn towards social reform.  <br/> <br/> Morris himself determined to become an architect, and began a magazine in 1856, the <i>Oxford and Cambridge Magazine</i>, that carried articles about social issues, as well as poetry and short stories. He paid for all the elements of publishing the magazine, but was formally the editor for only one issue. The magazine was given up after one year. Also in 1856 he began working in the office of George Edmund Street, where he studied architectural drawing until a friend convinced him he was better suited for art. After 1859 Morris was consumed with the design and construction of a house for himself and his wife to live in. He planned the details of the house down to the smallest element. At the same time he was giving up painting; the last of his paintings are dated from 1862. This house, called the Red House, was completed in Bexleyheath in 1860. The house was decorated almost entirely by works created by Morris, his wife or their friends. In 1861 Morris founded the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. decorative arts firm along with several friends. The firm created stained glass windows, metal work, carpeting, printed fabrics, murals, embroideries and many other decorations. In 1864 Morris suffered a severe illness and was forced to give up his home at Red House in order to remain with his work. They began turning a profit in 1866 as they produced decorations for churches, which had been their original target, as well as domestic settings. In 1867 they were commissioned to create a number of decorative elements for the \"green dining room\" at the South Kensington Museum. In 1874 Morris bought out the other shareholders of the company in order to become sole owner of the now-renamed Morris &amp; Co., a very capitalist move that put him at odds with his socialist friends.  <br/> <br/>Morris' interest in politics did not really develop until the 1870s, and he remained a Liberal until the beginning of the 1880s. In 1883 he became a member of the Democratic Federation, a predecessor to the Social Democratic Federation, and by March he had given a speech on the matter at Manchester, and in May was elected to the executive body of the party. He and Henry Hyndman, who had founded the party, worked closely together as leaders of the party until a split occurred, when Morris formed a breakaway faction, the Socialist League. The mouthpiece of this new faction, <i>Commonweal</i>, began printing his rallying chants and his prose works. In 1886 a further split within his own organization occurred between the more traditional Marxists and the anarchists, with Morris ultimately siding with the anarchists and distancing the Marxists. By 1887 the anarchists in the League were overwhelming the socialists. In 1888 most prominent socialists left the organization, and by 1889 the league was entirely an anarchist organization. Morris himself lost the position for editor of <i>Commonweal</i>, but had to continue paying for the costs of printing, to the tune of four pounds a week, a great deal of money at the time. In 1890 he too left the League, though he continued to publicly support socialism and to write articles about the ideology. In 1896 he delivered his final speech, which preached support for the unification of socialists and socialist ideologies, and also distanced himself from the anti-Parliamentary sentiments he had earlier espoused.    <br/> <br/>William Morris died on October 3rd, 1896 at the age of 62. <br/><h3>Personal Life  </h3>In 1859 he married Jane Burden, a woman who he had originally met in 1858 when he hired her to pose as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7828\" href=\"/queen-guinevere/4005-7828/\" slug=\"queen-guinevere\">Queen Guinevere</a> for his paintings. Together they had two children, Jane Alice and May. Their marriage was reportedly an unhappy one, but they remained together until Morris' death, despite Jane's affair with one of William's friends ",

    "description": "<p>Next to nothing is known about the woman known as Julia. The only reports of her existence come from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62949\" href=\"/joseph-barnett/4005-62949/\" slug=\"joseph-barnett\">Joseph Barnett</a>, the lover of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30941\" href=\"/mary-kelly/4005-30941/\" slug=\"mary-kelly\">Mary Jane Kelly</a>. He claimed that Kelly had taken to sharing their room at 13 Miller's Court with another prostitute, known to him only as Julia. He claimed that this sleeping arrangement lead to the quarrel that ultimately resulted in him leaving the room and taking lodging in another building. Reports that the two women were engaged in a lesbian relationship is unsubstantiated either way. Unlike others mentioned in the case, this Julia has never been formally identified, and thus no known documentation exists regarding her life. There have been suggestions that Julia was in fact Julia Venturney, a neighbour of Kelly's, but there is no evidence to suggest the women ever shared a room.  <br/> <br/>In <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's</a> <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\">From Hell</a></i> Julia was depicted as Kelly's lesbian lover, and it was suggested that it was she and not Kelly who was murdered by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a>, while Kelly herself fled to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55907\" href=\"/ireland/4020-55907/\" slug=\"ireland\">Ireland</a>. Like so much else, of course, there is no proof for or against this claim, but conventional Ripper knowledge holds that Kelly was the final victim, not Julia. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Thomas Bowyer was born c. 1825 in Surrey. He had served in the Indian Army sometime before 1888, and was receiving a pension from them. He lived at 37 Dorset Street, Spitalfields.  He worked for John McCarthy, and on the morning of November 9th, 1888 he was sent to collect rent from Mary Jane Kelly, who was several weeks overdue. He was sent sometime between 10 and 10:30 that morning. At first he knocked on the door and, when he received no reply he moved over to the window, which he noted as being broken. He moved the curtains and looked into the room. There, lying on the bed he saw the mutilated body of Kelly. Immediately he fetched McCarthy, who sent Bowyer to the Commercial Street Police Station. He reported the discovery to Inspector Beck, who was on duty there, and then returned to Miller's Court with police officers in tow. Walter Dew, who was in the station when Bowyer arrived, described him as terrified and unable to speak when he first arrived. <br/> <br/>Bowyer testified at the inquest into the murder on the 12th, but provided no new details, aside from clarifying which window he had looked in, as well as saying he had only seen Kelly drunk once before. He also stated in a newspaper interview that he had seen Kelly speaking with a man who had \"peculiar eyes\" on November 7th. <br/> <br/>In 1891 he was registered as a pauper in Shoreditch Workhouse. No further documentation of his life exists.    </p>",

    "description": "<p>Lizzie Albrook was born c. 1868. She resided in Miller's Court, and worked at a Common Lodging House in Dorset Street, possibly Crossingham's. She was a friend of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30941\" href=\"/mary-kelly/4005-30941/\" slug=\"mary-kelly\">Mary Kelly</a>, and claimed to have spent time with Kelly in her room at 13 Miller's Court on November 8th, 1888.

She claimed that Kelly had warned her not to fall into a life of prostitution, a life which Kelly had become involved in to avoid starvation, and also claimed that Kelly articulated her fervent desire to return to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55907\" href=\"/ireland/4020-55907/\" slug=\"ireland\">Ireland</a>. This was the last conversation she ever had with Kelly.

    "deck": "An English painter and friend of Oscar Wilde",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>George Francis Miles was born c. 1852, the son of a rector. He received his schooling at home, where he was taught by his father. By 1874 he had gone to Oxford, though not as an undergraduate, and around this time met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21052\" href=\"/oscar-wilde/4005-21052/\" slug=\"oscar-wilde\">Oscar Wilde</a>, who was his friend as well as rumoured lover. Also during this time he first spotted Lillie Langtry at the theatre, and later the pair were introduced by a mutual friend. He later introduced her to Wilde, as well as other members of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> high society. Langtry posed for one of his paintings, her first experience as an artists model. Miles also painted portraits for Daisy Grenville, Countess of Warwick, George and Ida Sitwell, and the Princesses Victoria, Maud and Louise.  <br/> <br/>The extent of the  relationship between Wilde and Miles is unclear. If the allegations that the pair were lovers is true, then this suggests that Miles was bisexual, as he was known to be interested many of the women, both ladies and working girls, that he painted. In either case he and Wilde shared rooms for a few years after 1878 at Tite Street in Chelsea. Miles paid for the rooms with the allowance given to him by his father, as well as commissions for his work. In the 1881 Wilde is listed as merely a boarder in the house. As well Miles, who had numerous connections in the upper echelons, was instrumental in introducing Wilde to many members of London society. <br/> <br/>In 1887 Miles was committed to an asylum near Bristol, called Brislington House. The exact reasons for his committal are unclear, but was probably neurosyphilis. He remained there for the next four years, until his death in 1891. The cause of death was given as a combination of \"general paralysis of the insane\", pneumonia and exhaustion. He was 39 at the time of his death. <br/><h3>Jack the Ripper </h3>The theory that Frank Miles was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> was first presented in 2008, in Thomas Toughill's book <i>The Ripper Code</i>. However, at the time of the murders Miles was being held in an asylum over 120 miles away from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a>. He had symptoms that included dementia and seizures, as well as disfigurement. The chances of him escaping from and returning to the asylum without attracting notice seem slim. Finally, he matches neither the most widely accepted description of the Ripper, nor the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55443\" href=\"/fbi/4060-55443/\" slug=\"fbi\">FBI</a> profile that has been compiled about the killer. This theory is therefore widely dismissed. ",

    "deck": "Assistant Commissioner (Crime) and Commissioner of Scotland Yard in the late 19th century",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>James Monro was born c. 1838 in Edinburgh, the son of a solicitor. He received his early education at Edinburgh High School, before matriculating to the University of Edinburgh. He also studied at the University of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55686\" href=\"/berlin/4020-55686/\" slug=\"berlin\">Berlin</a>. At the age of 19 he joined the legal branch of the Indian Civil Service, where he would remain until 1884. During his time there he held several positions, including Assistant Magistrate, District Judge, and Inspector-General of the Police for the Bombay Presidency. In 1884 he returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\" href=\"/england/4020-55794/\" slug=\"england\">England</a> and was appointed Assistant Commissioner (Crime) for <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56630\" href=\"/scotland-yard/4060-56630/\" slug=\"scotland-yard\">Scotland Yard</a>. He was also appointed Director of Criminal Investigation, leading the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Unlike his predecessor, he was immediately answerable to the Commissioner.  <br/><h2>Character Evolution</h2>During his early years in office he was mostly involved in operations against the Fenians, who had recently restarted their campaigns in England. To this end he worked with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62801\" href=\"/robert-anderson/4005-62801/\" slug=\"robert-anderson\">Robert Anderson</a>, with whom he formed a close bond. In 1887 the pair succeeded in foiling a bomb plot centred around <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30943\" href=\"/queen-victoria/4005-30943/\" slug=\"queen-victoria\">Queen Victoria's</a> Golden Jubilee, which was their most notable victory over the Fenians. During this time Monro also worked in secret spying operations, eventually getting control of the Special Branch, over the head of the Home Office, and turning it into the United Kingdom's central covert security office.  <br/> <br/>In 1886 <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30942\" href=\"/commissioner-warren/4005-30942/\" slug=\"commissioner-warren\">Charles Warren</a> was appointed Commissioner, despite the favourite for the position being Monro. The two men had never got on, and Warren did not appreciate the need for detective skills.  Also in 1888 Warren refused to accept Monro's friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62960\" href=\"/melville-leslie-macnaghten/4005-62960/\" slug=\"melville-leslie-macnaghten\">Melville Macnaghten</a> as Chief Constable (CID), which caused Monro to resign from his position in September. He was replaced with Robert Anderson. Nonetheless, he was left in charge of the Special Branch, and Home Secretary Henry Matthews gave him the title Head of Detectives, as well as an office in the Home Office. During the height of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> killings, CID officers and especially Anderson, continued to consult with Monro behind Warren's back, a move which was completely supported by Matthews.     <br/> <br/>In November of 1888 Warren, who had been worn down by public criticism and the disdain of his senior officers, resigned from his post. Monro was appointed in his stead, and was immensely popular with the officers of the force, though he was the shortest serving of all Commissioners, with a term of only 18 months. Almost as soon as he was appointed Commissioner he clashed with the Home Office over the number of officers, the quality of the uniforms worn by officers and their salaries. When his Assistant Commissioner died suddenly he supported promotions from below, while the Home Office hoped to put one of their own men in the position. Monro resigned on June 12th, 1890 after bills to increase salary and pension were deemed by him to be too little. His resignation took effect on June 21st, 1890, four days after a bill was passed that met all of his demands. He left the Yard as a hero both among officers and among the press.    After his resignation he returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55919\" href=\"/india/4020-55919/\" slug=\"india\">India</a>, where he founded the Ranaghat Christian Medical Mission. He ran the mission until 1903, when he retired back to England. <br/><h3>Personal Life, Death </h3>In 1863 he married Aberdeen-born Ruth Littlejohn. In June of 1888 he was appointed Companion of the Bath.  He died on January 28, 1920 at the age of 81  ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Melville Macnaghten was born in 1853, the son of the last chairman of the British East India Company. He received his education at Eton, and left school in 1872 to travel to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55919\" href=\"/india/4020-55919/\" slug=\"india\">India</a> on behalf of his father to manage the tea business in Bengal. In 1878 he married Dora Emily Sanderson, with whom he had 4 children. In 1881 Indian land rioters assaulted him, which brought him into contact with a man with whom he would later become close friends, District Inspector General of the Police in Bengal <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62959\" href=\"/james-monro/4005-62959/\" slug=\"james-monro\">James Monro</a>. In 1888 he returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\" href=\"/england/4020-55794/\" slug=\"england\">England</a> to stay, and was offered the post of Chief Constable (CID) by Monro, the Assisstant Commissioner (Crime) at the time. However, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30942\" href=\"/commissioner-warren/4005-30942/\" slug=\"commissioner-warren\">Charles Warren</a>, the Commissioner of Police, opposed the appointment, ostensibly because of Macnaghten's assault at the hands of the land rioters in India, but more likely because he didn't like Monro. On November 9th, however, Warren unexpectedly resigned, and Monro became Commissioner. In June of 1889 Macnaghten was appointed Assistant Chief Constable, and then promoted to Chief Constable in 1890 due to the sudden death of the previous Chief Constable.    <br/><h2>Character Evolution  </h2>In 1900 Macnaghten was involved in the Belpar Committee, which recommended fingerprints be used to aid in the hunt for criminals. In 1903 he was promoted to Assistant Commissioner (Crime). During this time he was involved in several well-known cases, including that of the infamous Dr. Hawley Crippen, who had murdered his wife, and the Stratton brothers, who were the first to be convicted largely on the basis of fingerprint evidence.  <br/> <br/>He was knighted in 1907, and in 1912 appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath. A year before, in 1911, he began to experience health problems. In 1913 he was awarded the King's Police Medal. That same year he was forced by his poor health to retire from policing. He published a memoir, <i>Days of My Years</i>, the next year, and dedicated the next ten years of his life to translating Horace's <i>Ars Poetica</i> from Latin into English verse.  <br/> <br/>He died on May 12th, 1921. <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Jack the Ripper </h3>Macnaghten was not involved in the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> case during the actual time of the killings, between August and November of 1888, but was very interested in the case. In 1894 he produced the Macnaghten memorandum, a secret memorandum in which he outlined the three suspects who he believed were most likely to have committed the murders. His favourite suspect was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30938\" href=\"/john-druitt/4005-30938/\" slug=\"john-druitt\">Montague John Druitt</a>, who he incorrectly identified in the memorandum as a 41-year-old doctor. There is no other contemporary police suspicion of Druitt, and many believe he was suggested only because he had committed suicide around the end of the murders. Macnaghten also made references in his memoir that suggested Druitt was the culprit.  <br/> <br/>He also suspected Aaron Kosminski, a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55922\" href=\"/poland/4020-55922/\" slug=\"poland\">Polish</a> Jew who was committed to an asylum in 1891. There was no contemporary evidence against Kosminski ever, and it has been suggested that Kosminski was suggested more because of anti-semitism than because he was likely the culprit. His final suspect was Michael Ostrog, a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55706\" href=\"/russia/4020-55706/\" slug=\"russia\">Russian</a> con-man and sneak thief. Again, there was little evidence, and indeed some evidence suggests that Ostrog may have been imprisoned in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\" href=\"/france/4020-55778/\" slug=\"france\">France</a> during the Ripper murders. <br/> <br/>Macnaghten's statements in the memorandum, his memoir and in the contemporary press suggest that he believed that he knew the identity of the Ripper at the time, and also that the Ripper had committed suicide shortly after the November 9th murder of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30941\" href=\"/mary-kelly/4005-30941/\" slug=\"mary-kelly\">Mary Kelly</a>. ",

    "deck": "A Scottish doctor and politician who conducted the inquest into the murder of Mary Jane Kelly",
    "description": "<p>Roderick Macdonald was born c. 1840 in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55911\" href=\"/scotland/4020-55911/\" slug=\"scotland\">Scotland</a>, the son of a crofter. He received his education first at Free Church Normal School, then at Glasgow University. He taught at Free Church School, Lonmore before studying medicine. In 1867 he became a Licentiate of both the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. He also became a member of the Inner Temple, one of the four Inns of Court a barrister or judge must be part of. He practiced medicine in the East End of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a>, and worked with the police as a divisional surgeon for the Isle of Dogs.  <br/> <br/>He was a member of the Crofter's Party, and in 1885 was elected a Member of Parliament for Ross and Cromarty, a seat that he held until he stepped down in 1892. In 1887 he was elected coroner for part of East Middlesex. In this capacity he presided over the November 12th, 1888 inquest into the murder of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> victim <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30941\" href=\"/mary-kelly/4005-30941/\" slug=\"mary-kelly\">Mary Jane Kelly</a>. The day after the murder he and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62946\" href=\"/george-bagster-phillips/4005-62946/\" slug=\"george-bagster-phillips\">George Bagster Phillips</a> were employed in sifting through the ashes in the fireplace to determine if there were any burnt organs there, as Kelly's heart was missing. All they found was scraps of woman's clothing.  <br/> <br/>During the inquest itself there was some vocal criticism by a member of the jury about him being in charge, as the murder had taken place in the jurisdiction of another coroner, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62803\" href=\"/wynne-edwin-baxter/4005-62803/\" slug=\"wynne-edwin-baxter\">Wynne Edwin Baxter</a>. Macdonald dismissed this claim, as the body had been brought into a mortuary in his jurisdiction. The inquest only lasted one day, and Macdonald was later criticized for its brevity and for his methods, which did not include speculating on the time of death or firmly establishing the identity of the deceased.  <br/> <br/>Macdonald died of cancer in 1894 at the age of 54. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Elizabeth Prater was born c. 1842 in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a>. In 1868 she gave birth to her first child, Charles Elder. Her second child, Kate Elder, was born in 1869. It is unknown if she was married to the childrens' father, or what became of him. In any case, she married William Prater in 1873. By this point she had possibly borne one child by him, a daughter named Elizabeth who was born in 1872, but who may also have been the daughter of William's previous wife. Prater claimed that she and her husband separated c. 1883. Nonetheless that had at least one more child together, a son named Thomas who was born in 1884. This suggests that the pair may have gotten together briefly after the separation, a supposition supported by their later frequent separations and reconciliations. <br/> <br/>By 1888 she was earning her living as a prostitute in London's East End. She lived above <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30941\" href=\"/mary-kelly/4005-30941/\" slug=\"mary-kelly\">Mary Jane Kelly</a>, at 20 Miller's Court, itself at 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. She reported leaving the court at about 9 p.m. on November 8th, when she encountered Kelly for the last time. The two women briefly spoke, before Prater left to ply her trade, returning to the court at about 1 a.m. the following morning. When she returned she reported waiting in the court for a man she shared the room with to return, and, when he failed to arrive, speaking with John McCarthy, who she claimed was the only person she saw enter the court. After this she went up to her bed. She was awakened between 3:30 and 4:00 by her kitten, Diddles, crawling across her neck. She claimed that at this time she heard a woman faintly scream \"murder\" two or three times. As this was a commonplace cry heard in the area she ignored it. At 5:30 she awoke again and went to a pub, seeing nothing unusual in the court. she returned to the court and went back to sleep, sleeping until about 11 a.m. Unlike other witnesses living in the court she did not report hearing Kelly singing anything during the night until several years later, when she was interviewed by a journalist.  <br/> <br/>By 1891 she and her husband had reconciled, and she was living with him. In 1892 she was back at Miller's Court. They were listed together in 1901, but she was again listed as living in Miller's Court in 1902. No other documentation exists of her life.</p>",

    "deck": "A witness at the inquest into the murder of Mary Kelly",
    "description": "<p>Caroline Maxwell was the wife of Henry Maxwell, a Lodging House Deputy at 14 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. She claimed to have known <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30941\" href=\"/mary-kelly/4005-30941/\" slug=\"mary-kelly\">Mary Jane Kelly</a> for about four months, and that the two women were on speaking terms, though later questioning indicated the two had only spoken once or twice before. In her statement given to police shortly after Kelly's murder on November 9th, 1888, Maxwell claimed to have spoken with Kelly sometime between 8:00 and 8:30 that morning, when Kelly informed her that she was the worse for drink and had recently vomited on the street. After this conversation Maxwell left for an errand in Bishopsgate. As she was returning home she claimed to have again encountered Kelly, some time between 8:45 and 9:00 though this time the two women did not speak. Instead, Maxwell claimed that Kelly was standing outside of a public house, The Britannia, and conversing with a man who appeared to be a porter but who she claimed she would be unable to point out again. She was able to describe Kelly's clothing, which she described as a dark dress, a velvet body and a maroon shawl.  <br/> <br/>Maxwell recounted this testimony at the inquest, which was held three days later on the 12th. Her testimony poses a rather large problem in that that last time she claimed to have seen Kelly was well past two hours after the latest time of death given for Kelly, sometime around 6:15 that morning. It has been suggested that Maxwell may have confused her dates or perhaps spoken to some other woman and not Kelly. This has raised several theories over the years. The first is that the woman with whom Maxwell spoke was the so-called \"Jill the Ripper\", a female killer who has been suggested by some to be the real culprit. It has also been suggested that the killer himself simply disguised himself in Kelly's clothes in order to escape the scene of the crime. The somehow more fanciful version suggests that it was some other woman, for instance one of the two who were noted to have shared the room in the days leading up to the murder, and not Kelly who was murdered on November 9th. This suggestion implies that Kelly had some reason to want the general public to believe that she was dead. This version was portrayed in <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's</a> <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\">From Hell</a></i>, in which Mary escaped the royal/ <a data-ref-id=\"4060-51206\" href=\"/freemasons/4060-51206/\" slug=\"freemasons\">Masonic</a> conspiracy and returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55907\" href=\"/ireland/4020-55907/\" slug=\"ireland\">Ireland</a>. Others have suggested that the doctors may have incorrectly determined the time of death. Her testimony was discounted by contemporary police and remains hotly debated. There is no conclusive evidence or supporting testimony that substantiates Maxwell's claim.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Almost everything known about Dr. Morgan Davies comes from the man who accused him of murder, R.D. Stephenson. What can be ascertained about Davies aside from the claims of Stephenson is that he was born c. 1854, probably in Cardigan in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55926\" href=\"/wales/4020-55926/\" slug=\"wales\">Wales</a>. He was trained as a surgeon in Aberdeen. By 1881 he was living in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a>, and unmarried. He was working as a House Surgeon in an unknown hospital. By 1891 he had married Margaret Julian, probably in 1890, and they had set up a home in Aldgate along with two young girls, aged 15 and 8, described as his niece and step-daughter, respectively. By this point he was a Registered General Practitioner. By 1901 he and his wife had had three children, one girl and two boys, and employed one servant.    <br/> <br/>In late December of 1888 R.D. Stephenson named Davies as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a>, claiming that he and the doctor frequently discussed the case. He alleged that the doctor had suggested that the killer was impotent without some sort of strong sexual stimulus, such as sodomy, and that the doctor himself was a woman hater. On at least one occasion he claimed that Davies had acted out the murders, showing how the Ripper had sodomized a victim then, in a frenzy, murdered and mutilated her.  <br/> <br/>There is no evidence that Davies was questioned at the time, or even suspected by the police. Despite what Stephenson seemed to believe, none of the victims were sodomized. Aside from idle speculation, if indeed he even was that involved in the case, there seems to be no evidence tying Davies to the case. He is widely disregarded as a suspect.</p>",

An unregistered mutant, the young man who would become known as Quill fled from government officers, afraid of incarceration or even execution (it is unknown whether he used his powers to commit a serious crime that would warrant such a punishment or if he was just paranoid). Captain America and his partner, Battlestar, interceded and helped government agents apprehend Quill. He claimed he was not a mutant, but received his powers from an accident.

Hearing that the Original <strong><a href=\"/jim-hammond/4005-12605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12605\">Human Torch</a></strong> had gone amok, he was surprised to be informed by one of his men that the grass around the pool was burning.Sardo assumed it was the Human Torch and quickly put on a diving suit and found the Torch laying on the bottom of his pool. He managed to put the the Torch into a large tube, then had his men haul the Torch and tube out. The Torch was still partially active and assumed that these men were helping him and wanted to be friends. Sardo instead brought the Torch to the Acmen Warehouse, Inc.(a business that refused to pay him protection money), placed inside the warehouse. Sardo threw a wrench at the tube shattering it and when the Torch`s body hit air it burst into flame .This caused the warehouse to ignite and be destroyed. When the Torch questioned why would his friend cause this destruction, he then realized for the first time that Sardo used him for a criminal act. The Human Torch flew back to Sardo estate and burnt his mansion, defeated Sardo`s henchmen and went to arrest Sardo himself. Sardo had hid in a bomb shelter but the Human Torch melted an opening. Trying to stop the Torch Sardo threw a bottle containing sulphuric acid, but it exploded from the heat of the Torch`s body and killed Sardo instead .</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-849111\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/849111-sardoht3.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.93632958801498\" data-width=\"267\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 267px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/849111-sardoht3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-849111\"><img alt=\"Capturing Sardo`s Men\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/849111-sardoht3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/849111-sardoht3.jpg 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\"></a><figcaption>Capturing Sardo`s Men</figcaption></figure>",

Lucio was given to two Greek freedmen (Aniceto and Beryl) and then continue their studies with two scholars of the time: Chaeremon of Alexandria and Alexander Ege, through which the young student developed his own philhellenism.<br /><br />In 49 Agrippina Minor married the emperor Claudius, who was his uncle, and obtained the withdrawal of the exile of Seneca, in order to use the words of the philosopher as a new tutor to the son. Furthermore, as the young Lucius showed more affection for her aunt Domizia Lepida, Agrippina for jealousy, made charges of plotting against the Emperor and obtained by Claudio's death sentence. On this occasion, the eleven-year-Lucio was threatened and forced by his mother to testify against her aunt.

Nero accused the Christians living in Rome. Anywhere from two hundred to three hundred Christians were put to death.   <br /><br />He was then accused, after death, of having caused the fire himself. Despite the reconstruction of events is uncertain and many aspects of the matter is still controversial, the iconographic image of the emperor playing the lyre from the highest point of the Palatino while Rome burned is widely regarded as outdated and unreliable. On the contrary, even the emperor opened his gardens to rescue people and had incurred the hatred of the nobles by sequestering huge quantities of food to eat. On the occasion of the reconstruction work, Nero and those new-looking building regulations designed to curb the excesses of speculation and draw a new urban plan, which is still based on the city. After he regained the fire destroyed a large area, by achieving the pharaonic building complex known as the Domus Aurea , his personal residence, which came to include the Palatine, the slopes of the Esquiline (opium) and part of the Celio, for an extension of about 2.5 square miles (250 hectares).<br /><br /><h3>Travel</h3><br />In 65 pisoniana conspiracy was discovered (so named by Gaius Calpurnius Piso), and the conspirators, including Seneca, were forced to commit suicide. The same fate also Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. At that time, then, according to Christian tradition, Nero ordered the beheading of St. Paul and, later, his crucifixion. <br /><br />In the same year, Poppea, Nero's waiting for the second died due to a pregnancy-related accident. According to Suetonius, however, Nero would have divorced her to marry Messalina Statilia and Poppea, retired at her villa at Oplontis, near Pompeii, would have died in 79 during the eruption of Vesuvius. <br /><br />In 67, the emperor traveled between the islands of Greece, aboard a luxurious galley on which amused the guests (among them all dumbfounded notables of the cities visited and tax of Rome, including Athens) with performances, while in Rome , Ninfidio Sabino (Tigellinus colleague, who had taken the place of the conspirators pisoniani) was acquiring the consent of the Praetorian Guard and senators. <br /><br />Before leaving Greece, Personals, putting themselves at the center of the stage isthmus at Corinth before the celebration of the Panhellenic games, the decision to restore freedom to the poleis, eliminating the provincial government of Rome. <br /><h3>Foreign Policy </h3><br />Under Nero, the king of Parthia Vologeses I put on the throne of the kingdom of Armenia Tiridates his brother, the late 54. This convinced Nero that was necessary to start preparations for war in view of an impending military campaign. Domitius Corbulo was sent to quell the skirmishes between local people and small group of Romans. In fact there was a real war until 58 AD After the conquest of Artaxata in 58 and the city of Tigranocesta, in 59, placed on the throne of King Tigranes IV shares, 60. The new king was not very favorable influence of the Romans and his brother Tiridates was replaced in the same 64. He died as the last outbreak of war and Nero was able to claim the title of Imperator (Pacator) crowned in Rome Tiridates The King and inaugurating the same time, the celebrations for the anniversary of the first three hundredth anniversary of the closing doors of the temple of Janus (236 BC) to the ecumenical peace achieved in the whole empire. Nero did mint a coin on which the obverse is his image with a crown proudly bearing the inscription: \"IMP NERO CAESAR AVG GERM\" on the back and the temple of Janus \"in camera\" with the words: \" PACE PR Ubiq PARTAIANVM CLVSIT SC. For the first time, therefore, an emperor of Rome boasts the title of Emperor. During his principality continued the conquest of Britain, although in 60-61 years was interrupted by a rebellion led by a certain Boudicca. <br /><h3>Death and burial</h3><br />Gaius Julius Vindex, governor of Gaul Lugdunense, rebelled after the return of the emperor in Rome, Nero and this led to a new wave of repression: among others, the general ordered the suicide Servius Sulpicius Galba, then governor of the Hispanic provinces. He, given no other alternative, declared his allegiance to the senate and Roman people no longer recognize the authority of Nero. Lucius Clodius also rebelled then Macero, commander of the legion III Augusta in Africa, blocking the supply of grain for the city of Rome. Nimfidio bribed the Praetorian Guard, who rebelled in their turn to Nero, with the promise of money by Galba. Finally, the Senate deposed him and Nero committed suicide on June 9, 68 which, they say, was helped by the freedman Epaphroditus. <br /><br />Nero's body was cremated and his ashes deposited in an urn of porphyry, surmounted by an altar of Luna marble. The burial site was the tomb of Domizi, under the present basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo.     <br /><h2>Requiem: Chevalier Vampire</h2> <br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890162-12943872678510.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1890162\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"2.0964285714286\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:209.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890162-12943872678510.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1890162\"><img alt=\"    The proud Roman Emperor of antiquity...\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890162-12943872678510.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890162-12943872678510.jpg 280w\"><noscript><img alt=\"    The proud Roman Emperor of antiquity...\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890162-12943872678510.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890162-12943872678510.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\"></noscript></a><figcaption>    The proud Roman Emperor of antiquity...</figcaption></figure>  When Nero died, he was resurrected in Hell (another name for Resurrection) as a vampire because of his astonishing cruelty in life.

He laments over the fact that he has only one organic arm and thus cannot play the lyre to the tune of Dracula's victims roasting on the crucifixes outside, which is no doubt a reference to his concert during the Great Fire of Rome. Oddly, he resembles <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47174\" href=\"/dr-frank-n-furter/4005-47174/\">Doctor Frankenfurter</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"4050-19149\" href=\"/rocky-horror-picture-show-the-comic-book/4050-19149/\">Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>. Nero displays a strong sadist personality in that he wants to violently maim and/or torture the Archaeologist responsible for relaying messages back and forth from the Hierophants to Dracula. This almost comes voluntarily, as Dracula displays little (if any) quality of concern for the Archaeologist. After Dracula gives the order to have the Archaeologist's mask permanently nailed to his face for dishonoring his presence, Nero is seen taunting the Archaeologist while he crawls around on the floor in agony.<br /> <br /><h3>Powers and Abilities </h3> <br />     <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890163-12943873889772.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1890163\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1071428571429\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890163-12943873889772.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1890163\"><img alt=\"A sadist, just as he was in life     \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" data-width=\"364\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890163-12943873889772.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890163-12943873889772.jpg 364w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A sadist, just as he was in life     \" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890163-12943873889772.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70198/1890163-12943873889772.jpg 364w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" data-width=\"364\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A sadist, just as he was in life     </figcaption></figure>    It can be assumed that Nero has inherited most, if not all, of the powers that define a traditional vampire. He has received a Dark Kiss along with the rest of Dracula's favored vampire allies, allowing him to retain his youth. As in life, he seems to be an immature clown obsessed with the pain of others. ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2> <p><br/> <br/>As a child in Macau Giancarlo Caranzo’s mother is killed by a thief known only as Palos “Eel,” and he vows to do anything necessary to find him and take revenge.</p> <p>Taken in by his mother’s friend Alessandro he does this by training to become not just a thief and safe cracker himself, but also an acrobat and martial artists. </p> <p>When he begins his career in crime tries to attract his “inspirations” attention by also taking the alias of Palos. </p> <p>The new Palos however is not truly into committing crime and so only robs from villains and true thieves, seeing to it that the money gets back to the victims, as well as performing other good deeds.</p> <p>Eventually he earns the name Palos on his own merits because like an eel is he is hard to catch, and if caught impossible to hold onto. </p> <p>As time goes by he comes to the attention of, and joins a spy network know as Neptune, working for them he discovers the truth about the death of his mother, who his real father is, and the identity of the original Palos all of which are  far different from what he has believed since a child.</p> <p>He also begins to find that what he has been told about Neptune is also a lie. </p> <p><u><b> Palos: thief/hero in the night</b></u></p> <p>Created by writer Virgilio and artist Nestor Redondo in 1961 the Eel started out in the anthology komik Tagalog Klasiks in 1961 as a simple thief with a heart of gold, his run done he was replaced by other story lines such as another Virgilio / Redondo creation, masked vigilante Gagamba “Spider,” both of whom prove so popular that several movies are made about both.</p> <p>Eight years later Redondo starts his own komiks company called Aries and gives the duo komiks dedicated to their adventures (a rare event for comics in the Philippines where such magazines are usually anthologies.) it’s in Palos Komiks that his story becomes more complicated. More films are made with one showing the two facing off against each other. </p> <p>Running for a little less than a two years the Eel disappears again, however it seems he’s to slippery for oblivion as he has recently returned again as a super-spy in a new television series in the Philippines starting in 2008.<br/> <br/>Whether his sometimes adversary Gagamba will also return remains to be seen.<br/><br/></p> <figure data-align=\"center\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/853303-palos_komik_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-853303\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"1.2076124567474\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/853303-palos_komik_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-853303\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/853303-palos_komik_cover.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/853303-palos_komik_cover.jpg 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></a><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><br/>",
