    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Born and raised in the city of Far Madding, Cadsuane travelled to the White Tower at <a href=\"/tar-valon/4020-56275/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56275\">Tar Valon</a> when she was fifteen and her ability to channel was discovered. She spent six years there as a Novice, and a further five as an Accepted before attaining the shawl. After being raised <a href=\"/aes-sedai/4060-57985/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57985\">Aes Sedai</a> she joined the Green Ajah, and soon after left the Tower to travel. In the Black Hills she met an elderly wilder named Norla, who humbled Cadsuane and instructed her. She also set Cadsuane a series of tasks for which she gained a series of angreal and ter'angreal. After leaving Norla, Cadsuane travelled the world, facing and defeating twenty male channelers, more than any other known woman, including those of the Red. She quickly attained legendary status among the other Aes Sedai, but actively resisted their efforts to elevate her to a position of power, refusing to be raised Sitter for the Green twice, or to be raised to head of the Green Ajah. When rumours began to circulate that she may be raised Amyrlin, she left the tower for ten years. She retired from the Tower twenty-five years before the Aiel War, travelling to Ghealdan where she grew roses with her surviving Warders. </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Cadsuane was created by <a href=\"/robert-jordan/4040-28136/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-28136\">Robert Jordan</a> for his book series <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, making her first appearance in the seventh book of the series, <i>A Crown of Swords</i>. She made her first appearance in comics in <a href=\"/robert-jordans-the-wheel-of-time-new-spring/4050-26541/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26541\">Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time: New Spring</a> #6, written by Jordan and <a href=\"/chuck-dixon/4040-41486/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41486\">Chuck Dixon</a> and Illustrated by <a href=\"/harvey-tolibao/4040-44854/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44854\">Harvey Tolibao</a>. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>New Spring </h3><p>During the <a href=\"/aiel/4060-56461/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56461\">Aiel</a> War, Cadsuane returns to the Tower from her self-imposed retirement. There, she encounters the newly-raised Moiraine Damodred, who suspects that Cadsuane may be of the Black. Somehow learning of the coming of the <a href=\"/rand-althor/4005-57750/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57750\">Dragon Reborn</a>, Cadsuane dedicates herself to preparing for his arrival. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Cadsuane is a very powerful channeler, one of the most powerful in at least a millennium. She is a gifted leader and possesses a powerful personality, with a gift for bending others to her will. As a channeler, her lifespan is greatly expanded compared to regular humans. However, as an Aes Sedai and thus bound by the Three Oaths, her potential lifespan is shortened.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>She possesses a collection of hair ornaments consisting of angreal and ter'angreal that, worn together, create something called a paralis-net, the exact nature of which is unknown in her Age. At least one of the ornaments is a well, allowing her to draw on saidar even in an area that is otherwise shielded, while another allows her to detect men who are channelling. </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Literature</h3><p><b><i>The Wheel of Time</i></b> </p><p>Cadsuane was originally created for the <i>Wheel of Time</i> series of books. She has thus far appeared in eight books in the series.</p>",

Yet no specific writer has ever been identified with such a name, of which the first known mention appears in an aside in a versified chronicle of weekly happenings that appeared regularly for several years, Jean Loret's <i>\"La Muse Historique\"</i>, collected in 1650. His remark, <i>...comme un conte de la Mere Oye</i> (\"...like a Mother Goose story\") shows that the term was already familiar.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Thayer Jost was the financier of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-5701\" href=\"/doom-patrol/4060-5701/\">        Doom Patrol</a> for a short time because he was envious of the metahuman condition. Jost believes in corporate sponsorship is a way to pay for costs (Jost's expenses that is). As much as Jost resented metahumans, he found the Doom Patrol profitable for a time. Jost even financed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-73022\" href=\"/botfly/4005-73022/\">       Amanda Beckett</a>'s research on Botfly larva which transformed her into Botfly and in turn Jost supplied Beckett with vagrants to experiment on. Jost also created a corporate funded team called the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58240\" href=\"/front-men/4060-58240/\">      Front Men</a>. The Front Men consisted of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-38958\" href=\"/the-animal-vegetable-mineral-man/4005-38958/\">          Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man</a>, Botfly and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-73021\" href=\"/porcelain-doll/4005-73021/\">     Porcelain Doll</a>. Jost recruited AVM Man by alerting the police of his location in order to test out Dr. Larsen's potential. Jost has been following the public's shifting opinion on heroes ever since <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\" href=\"/the-blackest-night/4045-55766/\"> Blackest Night.</a></p> <p>Jost then became the CEO of MSE which stands for Mister Somebody's Enterprises. After the Doom Patrol relocated to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56600\" href=\"/oolong-island/4020-56600/\">          Oolong Island</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50155\" href=\"/mr-nobody/4005-50155/\">    Mr. Nobody</a> transformed into Mr. Somebody and has taken possession of Jost's body. Mr. Somebody (Thayer Jost) embodies capitalism whereas Mr. Nobody used to represent Dadaism and anarchy. Jost is driven by Mr. Somebody to murder <a data-ref-id=\"4005-65066\" href=\"/the-toy/4005-65066/\">   the Toy</a>, a former member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55721\" href=\"/brotherhood-of-dada/4060-55721/\">  Brotherhood of Dada</a> because Mr. Somebody wanted to kill off any remaining connection to Mr. Nobody's past.      </p> <p>Jost also reduces Danny the Street into a single brick. Jost then lures the Doom Patrol into a trap where he has them fight the Front Men in front of various reporters, giving the impression that they had been attacked without provocation.  His plan to control the populace through the media by swaying their opinions becomes cemented when the Doom Patrol kills Jost and Mr. Somebody escapes.  </p>",

    "deck": "A young girl from Kansas who became an honorary, and eventually, full fledged member of the Doom Patrol. She has the ability to bring her imaginary friends to life.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Dorothy Spinner was given up for adoption by her biological mother at birth. Dorothy was then adopted at a young age by a mid-western couple who lived on a farm. Due to a facial deformity, Dorothy had an ape-like appearance, her face had strong ape-like features and her arms were incredibly hairy. Due to this she was constantly the target for bullying, thus, she was kept at home, isolated from the rest of the world. It was in her isolation that she discovered her power - the ability to bring her imaginary friends to life. Dorothy eventually came across the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/doom-patrol/4060-5701/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5701\">Doom Patrol</a> and was given the title of honorary, and then full, membership.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Dorothy Spinner was originally created by <a href=\"/paul-kupperberg/4040-44124/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44124\">Paul Kupperberg</a>, <a href=\"/erik-larsen/4040-4801/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4801\">Erik Larsen</a> and <a href=\"/james-sanders-iii/4040-12645/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-12645\">James Sanders III</a>. She made her first appearance in <a href=\"/doom-patrol-14-order-and-doom/4000-30258/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-30258\">Doom Patrol #14 - Order and Doom</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/grant-morrison/4040-40434/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40434\">Grant Morrison</a> would then go on to redefine the character and bring her on as a leading lady during his run on the Doom Patrol.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Order and Doom</h3><p>The first appearance of Dorothy Spinner - her farm becomes the battleground between the Doom Patrol, <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/power-girl/4005-4915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4915\">Power Girl</a> and Pythia. A young Dorothy, inspired by her heroes, the Doom Patrol, wound up joining the fight and prove instrumental to Pythia's defeat, finding her weakness. It was because of this that the Doom Patrol made her an honorary member.</p><h3>The Butterfly Collector</h3><p>A new Doom Patrol is in the works and Dorothy Spinner is recruited by <a href=\"/the-chief/4005-35126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35126\">The Chief</a> to serve as a member of the Doom Patrol's secondary outer-team.</p><h3>Imaginary Friends</h3><p>Dorothy and <a href=\"/joshua-clay/4005-54001/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54001\">Joshua Clay</a> are left at the Doom Patrol HQ while the rest of the team is away. Joshua was dealing with a device known as the <a href=\"/dreamstone/4055-55771/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55771\">Materioptikon</a> which had the power to externalize one's subconscious. The device wound up amplifying Dorothy's powers which resulted in three of her former imaginary friends - Damn All, Darling Come Home and Flying Robert - returning to life and forcing her to relive an old memory, suffering from her first period. With Joshua's help she was able to overcome the psychological hurdle and sent her imaginary friends away.</p><h3>Musclebound/The Men From N.O.W.H.E.R.E.</h3><p>Dorothy and the rest of the Doom Patrol team up with a new friend, <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/flex-mentallo/4005-24979/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24979\">Flex Mentallo</a> and <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/danny-the-street/4005-64958/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64958\">Danny the Street</a> to take on the <a href=\"/men-from-nowhere/4060-57172/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57172\">Men From N.O.W.H.E.R.E.</a> and find out what lies in the sub-sub basement of the Pentagon, known only as the Ant Farm. It just so happened that the Men From N.O.W.H.E.R.E. wanted to utilize the powers of the man who created Flex Mentallo, <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/wallace-sage/4005-69982/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69982\">Wallace Sage</a>, to summon a being known as the Telephone Avatar. In order to stop this Dorothy contacted an entity known as <a href=\"/candlemaker/4005-65306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65306\">Candlemaker</a> who wanted to use Dorothy and her powers as a gateway to the real world, promising Dorothy that he'd take down the Men From N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and the Telephone Avatar if she let him out. Dorothy did so and the Candlemaker held true to his promise, as when Dorothy woke the Telephone Avatar was dead, but the true test would come when she had to face the monster she released.</p><h3>Planet Love</h3><p>With the Candlemaker unleashed the world faces ultimate destruction. Dorothy and the Doom Patrol work together with <a href=\"/willoughby-kipling/4005-65315/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65315\">Willoughby Kipling</a> to locate the entity and send it back from whence it came. Kipling informs the rest of the crew that the Candlemaker is destroying not the world, but the world's soul, thus causing everyone it's affecting to go insane. During the assault from the Candlemaker the Chief is decapitated and Joshua Clay is killed, but, with help from Crazy Jane, Willoughby Kipling, William Magnus and a revitalized Rebis, the Doom Patrol is able to defeat the Candlemaker and extinguish it's flame.</p><h3>Sliding in the Wreckage</h3><p>Dorothy faces the real world now that the Doom Patrol has dissolved. She finds herself an apartment but is plagued by visits from African spirits who want Dorothy to join them. She refuses and fights back, using her own imaginary version of the Doom Patrol. Eventually she is reunited (and saved by) the real Robotman and the two of them go on to become members of a new, revitalized version of the Doom Patrol.</p><h3>The Teiresias Wars</h3><p>The renewed Doom Patrol is thrust into a war between the Teiresiae and the Builders. Dorothy somewhat aids the group with her Imaginary Friends and together the Doom Patrol saves the world yet again.</p><h3>Masquerade</h3><p>Regressing in her mental stability, Dorothy once again summons the African Spirits. It turns out that they're rooted in emotional and physical insecurities that led to Dorothy getting bullied for when she was younger. With aid from the Doom Patrol and the Violet City Witch Coven, Dorothy is able to overcome her fears and sends the African Spirits away for good.</p><h3>Death</h3><p>Dorothy had ventured out with <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/coagula/4005-51572/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51572\">Coagula</a> and Robotman on a camping trip, but it turned out that the two of them had found Dorothy's biological mother and planned for them to meet. Dorothy, unable to handle this news, unleashed an enormous amount of power that results in the death of Coagula and puts her in a coma. While in the coma she is put on life support; however, she is eventually taken off by Robotman as he believed it was for the best - resulting in her death.</p><p><strong>Doom Patrol - Young Animal</strong></p><p>Dorothy Spinner returns as a member of The Doom Patrol.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Dorothy had the power to create imaginary friends and bring them to life in the real world. Often times these imaginary friends were inspired by those close to her, and, if under enough mental stress, could cause more harm than good.</p><p>Some of her most common imaginary friends whom she used in battle were Dark As The Morning, Paddle The Sky and Pretty Miss Dot.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Abraxas is the counterpart of <a href=\"/eternity/4005-11332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11332\">Eternity</a> and the embodiment of destruction. He was kept in check by <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> by devouring planets to keep the energies of holding him intact. Shortly after the events of <a href=\"/galactus-the-devourer/4050-9110/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9110\">Galactus: The Devourer</a>, Abraxas was released and immediately sought to destroy not only <a href=\"/earth-616/4015-40920/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40920\">Earth-616</a>, but all parallel realities as well. Though he was fully capable of collapsing universes by warping the walls of dimensional space<b>,</b> he was in need of the <a href=\"/ultimate-nullifier/4055-40946/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40946\">Ultimate Nullifier</a> for it was the only thing that could possibly stop him<b>.</b> However, the only person on Earth who knew its location on <a href=\"/galactus-ship/4055-55839/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55839\">Galactus' Worldship</a> was the <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> since he was the person who located it within Galactus's ship in Fantastic Four v1 #48. Abraxas killed an alternate reality Galactus, and sent his head to Earth-616 for the Fantastic Four as a sign of warning. Later, an alternate reality <a href=\"/captain-universe/4005-27193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27193\">Captain Universe</a> showed up to <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> as a request of Eternity to show him what Abraxas was capable of. It is then that we see Abraxas standing over tens of dead Galacti (presumably he had defeated then in combat) and giving Reed Richards a warning that he is coming. So then, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> sought out the <a href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\">Watcher</a> who had forgotten who he was due to Abraxas. Though the context behind this was never shown.</p><p>After <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a> gathered heroes to fight the minions of Abraxas on the moon, the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> was killed by micro-organisms as he attempted to defend the Watcher from them. It was discovered that he possessed only part of the coordinates to the Ultimate Nullifier, which was split between the minds of three other Human Torches in alternate universes. After finding these alternate Human Torches, and passing on the information to the Human Torch of Earth-616, the Fantastic Four found the Ultimate Nullifier. However they were betrayed by the alternate version of <a href=\"/frankie-raye/4005-11605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11605\">Nova</a>, who worked for Abraxas.</p><p>After Nova gave Abraxas the Ultimate Nullifier, <a href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Franklin Richards</a> and <a href=\"/valeria-von-doom/4005-18247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18247\">Valeria Von Doom</a> found out that Galactus wasn't dead, but inside the heart of Eternity. They restored Galactus but burnt out their powers. Galactus then recalled the Ultimate Nullifier from Abraxas' grasp. Galactus said that the Ultimate Nullifier was actually part of him. Due to interference from Nova, the Ultimate Nullifier fell to Mr. Fantastic, who realized that the only way to destroy Abraxas was to destroy and then recreate reality using the Ultimate Nullifier. After he did; everyone who died, including the Silver Surfer, was brought back to life. Franklin Richards was left without any power, Valeria Von Doom was replaced with a new baby inside the womb of the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a>, and the Watcher was returned to normal.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Abraxas is a <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel</a> comic book character created by writer <a href=\"/jeph-loeb/4040-40472/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40472\">Jeph Loeb</a> and artist <a href=\"/kevin-maguire/4040-1785/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1785\">Kevin Maguire.</a></p><p>Abraxas first appeared in <a href=\"/fantastic-four-annual/4050-2129/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2129\">Fantastic Four Annual #31</a> released in 2001.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Abraxas had near-limitless cosmic power, enabling him to traverse and manipulate dimensions at will, restructure matter, and manipulate energy on a vast scale.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11123/111235221/4591591-images+%282%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4591591\" style=\"width: 176px\" data-ratio=\"0.86931818181818\" data-width=\"176\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11123/111235221/4591591-images+%282%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4591591\"><img alt=\"Abraxas showing off incredible power \" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11123/111235221/4591591-images+%282%29.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11123/111235221/4591591-images+%282%29.jpg 176w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px\" data-width=\"176\"></a><figcaption>Abraxas showing off incredible power </figcaption></figure><p>Abraxas has shown incredible power.

This caused a rift between the two which would never be repaired. Valeria was born in Latveria, to the Gypsy tribe known as the Zefiro, the same tribe as Victor Von Doom. This small stroke of fate would shape her, and indeed, the lives of her entire family and loved ones.</p><p> </p><p>She is the only known daughter of <a href=\"/boris/4005-8108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8108\">Boris</a> friend of Victor's parents and later the assistant of Doctor Doom. When they were young, Valeria was Victor's only friend among his tribe. By that time, the deaths of his <a href=\"/cynthia-von-doom/4005-47843/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47843\">mothe</a>r and <a href=\"/werner-von-doom/4005-47841/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47841\">father</a> have already made Victor a bitter and driven person, and though he used his ingenious devices to protect the tribe of which he had became a de facto leader, he was nevertheless feared by his fellow gypsies. This didn't matter so long as Valeria was with him. They were happy together and it seemed that love was soon to blossom between the two.</p><p>This all changed when Victor, seeking to flee Latveria, accepted an invitation to work for the American military and went to the USA. He severed all ties with Latveria and his tribe, Valeria included. It is unknown what happened to her at this point of her life, but soon Victor once again started to affect them indirectly.</p><p> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Troubled Friends</h3><p>After <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Victor Von Doom</a> experiments in America failed and he he fled the states. <a href=\"/baron-sabbat/4005-15593/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15593\">Baron Sabbat</a> anxious and under pressure to find and deliver Victor to the KGB, began to persecute the gypsies, believing they knew where he was. KGB did find out Doom's hiding place, but was unable to make him work for them, because they had nothing he wanted, and his intellect and devices made it impossible for them to force him.</p><p>Determined to acquire Doom, they made a plan to use Valeria against him. They made an arrangement with a member of Valeria's tribe who was supposedly a fortune teller, and he made a prophecy to Valeria that Victor is in terrible danger. He also supplied her with his location and urged her to go and find him.</p><h3>Reunion</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1045574-vic1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1045574\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.53410404624277\" data-width=\"865\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 865px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1045574-vic1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1045574\"><img alt=\" Happy reunion\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27500/1045574-vic1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1045574-vic1.jpg 865w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27500/1045574-vic1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption> Happy reunion</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1045575-vic2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1045575\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.69614512471655\" data-width=\"441\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 441px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1045575-vic2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1045575\"><img alt=\" Valeria threatened\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" data-width=\"441\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1045575-vic2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1045575-vic2.jpg 441w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Valeria threatened\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1045575-vic2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1045575-vic2.jpg 441w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" data-width=\"441\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Valeria threatened</figcaption></figure><p>Valeria found Victor in a small eastern European town, scarred, bitter and brooding over his failed attempt to free his mother from hell, on the edge of loosing his sanity.

However, Valeria was saved by an intervention of a member of a long forgotten buddhist sect who had been monitoring Doom as well. This, however, was the final straw.

This was now Doctor Doom, an imposing figure clad in armor and demanding of respect and obedience to him. She did not understand his desires for domination, and could not stomach the being he has become, and left him once and for all.

I chose science over sorcery. And I wanted chose again. Thus, I made a pact. I conjured a cabal of nether demons who claimed they would make me the magician I could have been... and greater besides. But as is too often true demons, there there was barter involved. One condition. I had to sacrifice something of indescribable value. Something irreplaceable. Something only you could give me. Farewell my love. Dear, dear Valeria. I will miss you more than any will ever imagine... but I will always hold you close to me.</i></p><p>A said ending to a good woman.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h4>Dr. Doom become a hero</h4><p>In another universe where Doom didn't gain his scar, as he asked Reed for help, and freed his mother soul, become a hero, and freed his country he reunited with Valeria and was to marry her. In their wedding day, Mephisto who was angry at Doom for freeing a soul from his domain, took Valeria but offered Doom a deal to free her, if Doom gave his soul to him he will release Valeria and the world will lose all the good he can do in it or he would allow him to take her and Doom would be free to do good in the world. Doom tearfully chose the later, but would do what his counterpart of Earth-616 did, in an attempt to save is mother, he would fight Mephisto army and if he won his love would be free. However, every time he try Doom never won and Valeria would remain a prisoner of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a>.</p>",

Ohnn decided to try to recreate <a href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\">Cloak</a>'s powers for the superhuman. But there was a malfunction on the machine and Ohnn found himself in a dimension called the Spotworld. Using one of the portals, Ohnn returned but found himself covered with spots. These spots were actually portals to the Spotworld.</p><p>At this time <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>, along with <a href=\"/black-cat/4005-1479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\">Black Cat</a>, decided to investigate Fisk's lab. Ohnn fought them using the name \"The Spot\". Spot managed to score his first victory against the two of them. But Spider-Man returned later and defeated Spot, destroying his confidence.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Spot was created by <a href=\"/al-milgrom/4040-3259/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3259\">Al Milgrom</a> and <a href=\"/herb-trimpe/4040-3439/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3439\">Herb Trimpe</a>. He first appeared in 1985's <i>The Spectacular Spider-Man</i> #94.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>After his first defeat at the hands of Spider-Man, Spot lost much of his self-confidence, resulting in many humiliating losses over the years and regrettably making him a joke to much of the superhuman community.</p><p>After being trapped in Spotworld for an indeterminate amount of time however, Spot grew progressively less sane. Coupled with a desperate drive for vengeance against a crime-lord for hospitalizing Ohnn's estranged son, Spot returned from Spotworld much more driven and dangerous then before, now having no qualms about taking lives. He has since gone from being a small-time crook to a nigh-inescapable hit-man.</p><p>Only time will tell though if Spot will manage to gain a lasting reputation beyond that of a joke.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Several years later, Spot reappeared in the <a href=\"/legion-of-losers/4060-52900/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52900\">Legion of Losers</a>. Spider-Man tricked two members of the squad to turn on the rest of the team and defeated them.</p><p>Later, <a href=\"/the-gideon-trust/4005-18257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18257\">The Gideon Trust</a> forced Spot into opening a portal to <a href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\">The Negative Zone</a>. They were hoping to use its resource for their own gain. But the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> happened to be trapped in the Negative Zone and defeated the Gideon Trust. Spot seemed to have died in the process.</p><p>Spot actually survived the last battle and was put into a super prison called the Cage. He teamed up with a group of villains led by <a href=\"/tombstone/4005-3161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3161\">Tombstone</a>. Spot snitched on Tombstone, but Tombstone still managed to use Ohnn to escape, and then broke Spot's neck.</p><p>Spot later appeared trying to contact a close friend, <a href=\"/slyde/4005-3780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3780\">Slyde</a>. He was upset that <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">Hydra</a> was killing off lesser super-villains. When Spot met Slyde, he found him dead with <a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra</a> and <a href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\">The Hand</a> standing over his body. Spot was captured and taken to join the Hyrda's army of super-villains.</p><h3>MODOK's 11</h3><p>Spot later joined <a href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\">MODOK</a>'s villainous team, <a href=\"/modoks-11/4060-44594/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44594\">MODOK's Eleven</a>. He betrayed the team for a large payoff, but his employer the <a href=\"/the-mandarin/4005-3530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3530\">Mandarin</a> trapped him afterwards in the world the Spot had first obtained his powers.</p><h3>Marked - Spot's Return</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128053-spt2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1128053\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2756183745583\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128053-spt2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1128053\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128053-spt2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128053-spt2.jpg 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" data-width=\"283\"></a></figure><p>The Spot was trapped in his own anti-dimension and had no idea which was the route out. Occasionally he could project his image back to our world and tried to contact some of his old cronies at the <a href=\"/bar-with-no-name/4020-57305/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57305\">Bar with No Name</a> but that attempt was unsuccessful. The Spot was going mad but found peace when he concentrated on his son, Wyatt Ohnn. One day, the Spot was able to return back to our dimension and discovered his son was hospitalized after a drive-by shooting. The man responsible for his son's condition was a Russian crime-lord named <a href=\"/dmitri-ivankov/4005-61518/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61518\">Ivankov</a>. From that day forth, the Spot spent every waking moment on the perfect method of vengeance and revenge. Spider-Man was spying on Ivankov and his gang during a possible weapons transaction. Ivankov's men were systematically killed by a dimensional hopping assassin and Spider-Man realized it was the Spot. Ivankov pleaded for Spider-Man's help so the web-slinger did his best to fight off the Spot. Parker's spider sense was unable to warn him of incoming danger because the Spot started his attacks from another dimension. The Spot was able to grab Ivankov and throw him into one of his portals. Ivankov emerged outside of <a href=\"/seattle-washington/4020-57170/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57170\">Seattle's</a> Space Needle and was descending to his doom. Spider-Man saved Ivankov by webbing his feet and pulling him back through the portal. Spider-Man webbed his left arm to Ivankov's right arm and stood his ground against the Spot. He told the Spot that he was not going to let him kill anyone and staked his life on that statement. The Spot stood there silently until he pulled out a package from his chest cavity. The Spot presented that package to Spider-Man and disappeared. Inside was the book, Treasure Island and it was the same book that he use to read to his son every night before his accident. Spider-Man delivered the book to Wyatt's hospital room and his mother found it. Ivankov would be placed in the psychiatric unit of Bellevue Hospital after his incident with the Spot. Ivankov was hysterical and would be in constant fear of the Spot.</p><p>Spot's most recent appearance was in 2011's Daredevil #1 written by <a href=\"/mark-waid/4040-40724/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40724\">Mark Waid</a>. In the issue, Spot is about to interrupt a wedding when <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a> intervenes. The two fight it out with Daredevil eventually winning.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128054-spt7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1128054\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.82368421052632\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:82.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128054-spt7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1128054\"><img alt=\"The Spot with a great counter move.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" data-width=\"380\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128054-spt7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128054-spt7.jpg 380w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Spot with a great counter move.\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128054-spt7.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1128054-spt7.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" data-width=\"380\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Spot with a great counter move.</figcaption></figure><p>Being exposed to the Spotworld has bleached Ohnn's skin white and dotted it with warps in space. These spots can transport things or people to another area by way of another spot and passing through the Spotworld. Ohnn can also teleport himself or extend parts of his own body over various distances as defined by his spots. He also has the ability to move the spots all over his body or even taking them off and placing them somewhere else. He can even suspend the spots in mid-air.</p><p>Spot cannot however throw an unlimited number of his space warp spots, as he primarily draws on the ones on his own body. Spider-Man for instance was able to defeat Spot when his body was mostly white. Spotworld does have an infinite number of spots though, from which Spot can retrieve them should he wish to do so.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><p><b>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610)</b></p><p>In this reality, the only information about the Spot is that he is a man named Frank, who works for <a href=\"/roxxon-oil/4005-30339/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30339\">Roxxon Oil</a> Industries.

A young Hal Jordon was there too, watching his father's test flight. Carol and Hal talked, and found that they both wanted to be pilots when they grew up. Tragedy struck however, and Hal's father' plain crashed.</p><p>Years later, a grown woman, Carol's father had retired from running his company and left it to Carol to run. Prior to that, Carol had been fulfilling her dream of being a pilot, but she gave that up to run the company becasue she felt it was her responsibility.</p><p>Two years after she assumed control of the company, she went to a meeting at Arden Air. She was making a deal to buy the company from <a href=\"/ken-arden/4005-61662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61662\">Ken Arden</a>. Hal Jordon, who still blamed Carol's father for his dad's death (Carl Ferris had skied on materials to cut costs on the plane Hal's father had been flying that day), was working there.</p><p>There was a test flight flying out of Arden that day, and it went wrong. Hal, in his debut appearance as Earth's Green Lantern, saved the flight. Carol saw the whole thing, and was immediately smitten with him, much to <a href=\"/hector-hammond/4005-10210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10210\">Hector Hammond</a>'s consternation. Hammond, one of Carol's employees, had been trying to get Carol to agree to go out with him for some time, though Carol had continually refused him.</p><p>A week later, Carol was having trouble keeping her company afloat becasue some of the people who would have given her design contracts didn't respect her the way they had her father (presumably becasue she was a woman and, at that time, there was more than a little gender prejudice going around about things like women running businesses). For the same reason, she was getting a lot of resignations from former Arden employees who didn't like the change in leadership.</p><p>At the same time, Hammond was exposed to something and mutated into a highly disfigured telepath. When Hal came into her office to throw in his resignation with the rest (though, in his case, it had more to do with the grudge her still had against her father). Carol let him vent a little about his grudge, but then asked if he wanted to fly again. Hal had just recently crashed a test flight (when he'd gotten his Green Lantern ring) and prior to that, he had a real reputation as a risk-taker and a hot-head. Ken Arden had only kept him on becasue he'd known his dad. No one wanted to hire him either, just like no one seemed to want to fly for her. Hal took the job.</p><p>Hal flew his first test flight for Carol the next day, and when he landed the plain, Hammond attacked, intent on his feelings for Carol. Hal saved her though, but disappeared afterward mysteriously.</p><p>A couple days later, Hal showed up at Carol's house at night and demanded to see her father. It was then reveled that Carol Ferris was sick, dying really. Carol told Hal that the guilt he had about his father's death had eaten him up inside over the years. Hal and Carol made a real connection that night, Hal telling Carol he was so sorry for what she was going through, and that she wasn't alone.</p><p>From there on, Carol ran Ferris Aircraft with just Hal Jordon and <a href=\"/tom-kalmaku/4005-19066/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19066\">Tom Kalmaku</a> as her employees. Hal asked her out on a date, but Carol just smiled and said \"Oh Jordan, everyone knows. I don't date employees\". She went on to make her company into a success.</p><p>Note: This origin story is somewhat different, and more completely told, that the one told in the 1959-1960 Green Lantern books.

He thinks they're all bad news, mostly becasue of his horrific experience with Parallax. Carol disagrees though, saying what if the entities are like the different Corps, some good and some bad?</p><p>From there, the group splits up. Carol goes after the Predator, Hal after Ophidian, and Sinestro and Atrocitus go after The Butcher.</p><p>Carol tracks The Predator to Las Vegas, Nevada, where she gets a message through her ring from <a href=\"/queen-agapo/4005-58459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58459\">Queen Aga'po</a> of the <a href=\"/zamarons/4060-39176/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-39176\">Zamarons</a> that she needs to find her quarry soon, becasue the Star Sapphire Corps central battery is losing power. Unbeknownst to Carol, Aga'po has been giving the battery her own power, her own immortal life-force and beauty, to keep it going since the Black Lanterns destroyed the previous power source the battery used. Aga'po is planning to use The Predator as the new power source, but cautions Carol that The Predator is dangerous and violent. Carol, whose been possessed by The Predator in the past when her heart was broken by Hal once upon a time and she had lost faith in love, doubts what Aga'po says about the Predator being violent by nature is true, but none the less continues her mission to find it.</p><p>What she finds though, is <a href=\"/larfleeze/4005-58504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58504\">Larfleeze</a> in a casino making trouble becasue of an all you can eat buffet he's spotted. That's when The Predator makes it's appearance, having possessed a man named <a href=\"../../abraham-pointe/29-73358/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abraham Pointe</a>. Abraham was a shy loner type who had a crush on a kind and pretty woman named Lisa who worked at that casino. He'd been coming to that casino and taking her picture for a long time, but had never believed in himself enough to think that someone as good and amazing as her would return his feelings.</p><p>The Predator, attracted to his despair and wanting to heal it, possessed him and brought him to Lisa, but basically charged in like a bull in china shop while doing it. Carol fought the possessed man, trying to get him to stop, believing that The Predator was being driven by the man it had possessed, and not the other way around. The Predator was just too powerful though, but not really interested in fighting her back that much.

That's when Carol figured out what was going on. She talked to the possessed man, calmed him down, told him that we all want to be loved and that it was okay to feel that way, then she kissed him and The Predator left him.</p><p>Having achieved her objective, the Zamarons teleported Carol, The Predator, Hal, Abraham, and Larfleeze to Zamaron.</p><p>On Zamaron, Aga'po and the other Zamarons wanted to put The Predator into their central power battery to stop it's power from fading away, and to keep The Predator contained so it wouldn't be a danger to others. Carol argued that The Predator shouldn't be locked away, that it seeks out hosts that don't know what love is in order to heal them. That the damage done is the fault of those hosts who take a rocky path towards discovering their path towards love, and not due to any violent intent on the part of The Predator. After all, a heart that does not believe in love is a lonely one, prone to acting out it's sorrows, frustrations, and pain.</p><p>Further, she says that they don't even need The Predator to power their battery, that none of the other Corps use anything save belief to power their batteries (though it's worth noting that, in the case of the Red Lanterns, that is not actually true, becasue they use the blood of the guilty for that purpose). Queen Aga'po takes Carol's words to heart, and pronounces that Control is right. She goes to the central battery and gives it the remainder of her life and her power in an act of faith in the power of love. With her last words, she names Carol as her successor as queen. With Aga'po's gift, the power battery blazes with new life and power and the Star Sapphire Corps are saved.

Carol defined them, telling them that she was on a mission to save a lost love, and wasn't that what the Star Sapphire Corps was all about?

In space, she can generate an interstellar space warp to travel between solar systems at great speed.</p><p><strong>Energy Blasts, Shields, and Constructs</strong>: She can fire energy beams with destructive power, generate energy shields for defense, and create energy constructs that can take the form of anything she can imagine. The power of these is proportional to her ability to tap into and believe in the love within her heart.</p><p><strong>Sapphire Crystals</strong>: She can surround others in a prison of sapphire crystal to show them what they love most, as well as bring out the love that may be buried in their hearts.</p><p><strong>Heart Tethers</strong>: A heart tether can bring her to someone she loves or guide her to where love is threatened out among the stars.</p><p><strong>Teleportation</strong>: She is able to teleport herself and others on an interstellar scale, provided she can harness enough love to power it. (Example: She once teleported Hawkgirl and Hawkman from Zamaron back to Earth.)</p><p><strong>Healing</strong>: She can use the power of love to heal even normally fatal wounds (as she did once for Queen Mera). Conceivably, she could also even bring someone back from the dead (as fer fellow Star Sapphire Corpswoman, <a href=\"/miri-riam/4005-57913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57913\">Miri Riam</a>, did once).</p><p><strong>Heart Prophecies</strong>: She can use her power to look into someone's heart and show them a vision of their future.</p><p><strong>Emotional Control</strong>: Carol, having had more experience with the power of the Star Sapphire than almost anyone save, perhaps, for the Zamarons, has a comparatively high ability to harness love's power and not be carried away or overwhelmed by it as some others may be.</p><p><strong>Other Star Sapphire Corps Abilities</strong>: Other members of the Star Sapphire Corps have demonstrated a few other abilities, or variations on Carol's established abilities, that Carol herself hasn't yet used.

The Zamarons sent a telepathic signal to him, telling him where she would be, and, having been showed up once, Hal was eager to have a second battle with her. He waited in ambush and trapped her in a green energy cage, but Carol simply teleported herself free. They fought a duel of energy beams and shields. It seemed they were fairly evenly matched, when Hal detected that there was a transmission being sent to her and surrounded her in an energy field that cut off the transmission. Free of the Zamarons' influence, Carols stopped fighting him and passed out.</p><p>Hal dropped the force-field, and the Zamarons teleported her back to their ship. They told her that because she lost, she wasn't worthy to be their queen after all. They took away her memory of their encounter and left. Hal found her and took her back home.

When Hal was helpless before the apparitions she'd made, she dissolved them into mist.

For some reason, possibly because she was still so troubled over Hal/Green Lantern's having destroyed her airplane, costing her that 9 million dollars, and having stormed off without any explanation (breaking things off between them in truly spectacular fashion), the part of her subconscious mind that held her Star Sapphire persona made the association between the Green Lantern Bar and Green Lantern himself, causing her to hallucinate that the bomber, who looked at least generally like Hal, was Hal, and that Superman had killed him. The Star Sapphire part of her took over and swore vengeance on Superman for murdering the man she loved.</p><p>Her Star Sapphire gem, formerly kept in a museum in Coast City, was coincidentally on loan to a museum in Metropolis. And, more coincidentally yet, had accidentally made it's way into the possession of <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a> (star reporter of the Daily Planet and Superman's long-time love-interest). Carol/Star Sapphire tracked the gem mentally to the <a href=\"/daily-planet/4020-55695/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55695\">Daily Planet</a> building and, once she was close enough, called it to her mentally. Clark Kent confronted her and she blasted him away, not knowing he was actually Superman in disguise. It turned Clark into a ballistic projectile that snapped an elevator cable. Clark was able to use his powers to save the people in the elevator. Meanwhile, outside, Star Sapphire was making a spectacle of herself, hoping to draw Superman out to face her.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4023556\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5293453724605\" data-width=\"886\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 886px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4023556\"><img alt=\"Star Sapphire easily defeats Superman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg 886w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Star Sapphire easily defeats Superman\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg 886w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4023556-s261-2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Star Sapphire easily defeats Superman</figcaption></figure><p>Superman did indeed show up, and turned out to be no match for her. She knocked him down with her power beams and fastened her star sapphire gem around his neck with a necklace. That done, she was able to use the gem to control his mind and make him bow down before her to kiss her boot. Then, in the first truly amoral and villainous act she'd ever done as Star Sapphire, she commanded Superman to kill a building full of people so that everyone would see him for the monster she saw him to be. [note: This take on Star Sapphire's character is wildly different than anything portrayed about her in the past, though it could be explained away by the recent traumas in her past. She was crippled, put in a wheel chair, made to feel helpless, then the man she loved had a literally explosive bout of temper and left her without any real explanation. She had also, not that long ago, learned the truth about herself even having Star Sapphire as an alter-ego, the effects of that revelation unknown but potentially damaging to her mind if she tried actively to bury, suppress, or fight against that part of herself. The Zamarons, presumably, might not have foreseen or accounted for that when they implanted the Star Sapphire persona within her.]</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4023557\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5949177877429\" data-width=\"669\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 669px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4023557\"><img alt=\"Green Lantern alive after all\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg 669w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Green Lantern alive after all\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg 669w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg 480w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4023557-s261-3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Green Lantern alive after all</figcaption></figure><p>It was only Lois Lane who was able to stop her from making such a terrible mistake. Lois dressed up as Star Sapphire (she'd had the costume on loan from the museum at the time) and confused Superman into flipping over in the air so the necklace would drop off. [note: How Lois was able to do this wasn't explained, nor why Carol/Star Sapphire couldn't simply command the gem to stay where it was mentally when she'd only moments before done something just like that in summoning it to her in the first place. One could, however, presume surprise on the part of Carol and some programming glitch in the gem itself, keyed to the specific physical appearance of it's mistress, as the explanations for why Lois's unlikely ruse actually worked. As for why Lois had the Star Sapphire outfit, the explanation was that she'd been given it by the museum curator for research purposes on a story she was doing about the gem, though, obviously, that explanation is either more than a bit thin or more than a bit kinky.]</p><p>With Superman free, Star Sapphire teleported herself away and swore to return and carry out her vengeance another day.

Carol sat with him while it happened and went to the funeral with him. There was another menace for Green Lantern and Green Arrow to fight, and that helped Hal get his spirits back up some. Later, Carol, Dinah, Hal, and Oliver got together at her place to spend the evening together.</p><p>Hal left a day or two later to go get back to his trucking job, but no sooner had he gone than a creature made of something that looked like glowing rocks or earth attacked Carol's home, causing a good deal of damage and pinning her legs under the wreckage. Carol used the radio that Hal had given her, mercifully near by, to call him to come and help her. Hal was able to shore up the damage and get Carol out from under the wreckage she'd been trapped under, but the strange creature got away in the process.</p><p>Hal took some of the powdered concrete that the creature had left behind and went off to give it to his friend <a href=\"/ray-palmer/4005-34685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34685\">Ray Palmer</a> (The Atom) to analyze so he could hopefully figure out what was going on.

Presumably Carol would have found that out at some point during or after this whole ordeal, though it was never mentioned when/if she did.</p><p>Note #2: In Green Lantern/Green Arrow #110, when Hal and Oliver were commiserating over his and Carol's breakup and Dinah overheard what Oliver said about Carol, Dinah took Carol's side and it actually caused Dinah to break up with Oliver over it too...

Carol flatly turns him down. Saying that it's never been about that with them. It's always been about what's right, about helping people. She tells him that, no matter what he's done as Parallax, she still believes in him. Still believes he's a good person at heart.</p><p>They kiss one last time and Hal goes off, successfully reigniting the son, and giving his life in the process.</p><p>In the aftermath, she attends his funeral and gives a eulogy. Saying that their relationship had had it's ups and downs, and they'd broken up several times, but that in the end, she felt that Hal was true to her. That in the end, Hal had been true to everyone.

She is shown to have no control of her body when the Star Sapphire entity emerges, and is unaware of her transformations. Star Sapphire terrorizes Hal Jordan and <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>, and subsequently kidnaps and frames an English reporter named Georgette Taylor for her crimes in order to divert suspicion from herself.</p><p>After Batman and Hal rescue Georgette, Star Sapphire attempts to open a portal to Zamaron that will allow the planet's military to arrive on Earth in order to conquer it. While Batman battles the Zamaron soldiers, Hal pleads with Carol and eventually convinces her to return to her senses. After she does so, she expels the Star Sapphire from her body and loses all of her memories from her time as the entity's vessel. Carol was voiced by Rachel Quaintance while Star Sapphire was voiced by Vicki Lewis.</p><p> </p><h4><a href=\"/justice-league/4075-47/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-47\">Justice League </a>/ <a href=\"/justice-league-unlimited/4075-57/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-57\">Justice League Unlimited</a> (2001-2006)</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3819641\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3819641\"><img alt=\"Carol as Star Sapphire in Justice League Unlimited\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.png 1280w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Carol as Star Sapphire in Justice League Unlimited\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.png 1280w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/3819641-snap-2014-05-13-22h25m45s109.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Carol as Star Sapphire in Justice League Unlimited</figcaption></figure><p>Although never specifically identified as such the character of Star Sapphire appears in numerous episodes of the animated series Justice League Unlimited, and often as the member of the <a href=\"/injustice-league/4060-22672/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22672\">Injustice League</a>.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Cobweb is an immortal demon of the Mindscape and has haunted the Mindscape since times immemorial, before recorded time. In doing so, he became the prime enemy to the valiant Sleepwalkers, a race of guardians for the Mindscape.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Cobweb was created by <a href=\"/bob-budiansky/4040-10224/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-10224\"> Bob Budiansky</a> and <a href=\"/bret-blevins/4040-5102/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5102\"> Bret Blevins</a> in 1991 and first appeared in <a href=\"/sleepwalker/4050-4600/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4600\"> Sleepwalker</a> # 3.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Enemy of the Sleepwalker</h3><p>Cobweb was a menace to the Mindscape for many years, and had more recently encountered one of the strongest Sleepwalkers he had met. In trying to escape from this Sleepwalker, he entered the mind of a human from earth named Rick Sheridan. While Sleepwalker followed, Cobweb again left the mind, and trapped the Sleepwalker. This caused Sleepwalker to remain inside the mind of the young human man.</p><p>Not much was heard from Cobweb again until it was revealed that he had planned an invasion on earth, along with many of his demons, at that time looking like other Sleepwalkers. With the help of other heroes such as the Avengers, Sleepwalker managed to defeat Cobweb.</p><p>Some years later, Cobweb was seen again in a flashback when Rick Sheridan was contacted by the Fantastic Four to help against demons coming from Franklin Richards' dreams.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>His body does resemble a living web. He has enhanced human agility, reflexes, stamina and speed. He demonstrated superhuman strength, able to lift at least 10 tons. His body is elastic and malleable. He can elongate his body and limbs to an unknown degree. He has demonstrated an ability of creating duplicates of himself, though they remained connected to each other by web-threads.</p><p> </p><p>Cobweb feeds on mental energy and the madness of others is the main source of his power. He is a master of illusion, leaving victims unable to distinguish between dreams and reality, truth and lies. Manipulating them towards madness. He can probe minds for information (memories, thoughts and images).</p><p> </p><p>He has demonstrated an ability to physically enhance others or heal them from lethal wounds. Whether he uses illusions to exaggerate the extent of his abilities on these fields is unknown. He can uses technological means to teleport his minions.</p>",

She was very talented and had a bright future. It was also the place where Alyssa would meet fellow student <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rick-sheridan/4005-18284/\"> Rick Sheridan</a>. The two started dating not much later.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Alyssa Conover was created by <a href=\"/bob-budiansky/4040-10224/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-10224\"> Bob Budiansky</a> and <a href=\"/bret-blevins/4040-5102/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5102\"> Bret Blevins</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/sleepwalker/4050-4600/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4600\"> Sleepwalker</a> issue 1 (1991).</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Major Story Arcs</h2><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Relationship</h3><figure style=\"width: 264px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3026777\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114734/3026777-alyssa+conover+1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.9128787878788\" data-width=\"264\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:191.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114734/3026777-alyssa+conover+1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3026777\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114734/3026777-alyssa+conover+1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114734/3026777-alyssa+conover+1.jpg 264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" data-width=\"264\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The relationship between her and Rick became complicated when Sleepwalker's presence caused Rick sleep problems. This all became even worse when rival <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/whitney-cooper-iii/4005-18301/\">Whitney Cooper III </a>made the scene. Slowly he tried to lure Alyssa away from Rick. This eventually worked out, because of Rick's constant lack of attention to her, letting Alyssa feel that Rick did not want to see her. Eventually the couple broke up, but remained friends and still liked each-other very much.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Alyssa later became a victim of Cobweb's plans when he sended the criminals known as the Chain Gang into her mind. One of the members, Uplink, took control of her mind and tried to get her to kill Rick, Sleepwalker's host. Luckily, Alyssa was stopped by Sleepwalker and soon returned to her own self.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The precense of Sleepwalker did have a profound effect on Alyssa, she started fearing him, not knowing why he kept appearing near her so ofter and what his intentions where.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Death</strong></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It was reported by Rick Sheridan that Alyssa had died during a car crash, unrelated to any superhero fights.

    "deck": "Rick Sheridan was a happy, healthy college student whom became the host of the alien Sleepwalker",
    "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Origin</h2><p>Rick Sheridan was a happy, healthy college student with a promising future in film. He had recently left the home he grew up in to live alone in the big city of New York, with his loyal pet, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rambo-the-dog/4005-18285/\">Rambo The Dog</a>. Even though Rick left, his parents and little brother where still a big part of his life. Rick eventually found a place to live, rent-free, in the building of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-epstein/4005-18308/\">Mr. Epstein</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mrs-epstein/4005-18309/\">Mrs. Epstein</a> as long as he would be the superintended for the building. He even found a girlfriend in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alyssa-conover/4005-18283/\">Alyssa Conover</a>, a fellow student from his college. Things looked up for Rick. All that changed when an eerie creature began appearing, first in his dreams... and then later in the real world. Every-time Rick woke up, he saw television footage of a strange creature roaming the streets at night. It was the same creature from his dreams! Now, his life in shambles, Rick is afraid to sleep... afraid he'll release the mysterious being known as Sleepwalker.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Creation</h2><p>Rick Sheridan was created by <a href=\"/bob-budiansky/4040-10224/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-10224\"> Bob Budiansky</a> and <a href=\"/bret-blevins/4040-5102/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5102\"> Bret Blevins</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/sleepwalker/4050-4600/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4600\"> Sleepwalker</a> issue 1 (1991). With the publication of Sleepwalker, a long dream of writer Bob Budiansky was finally fulfilled, as he had the plans for Sleepwalker as early as the late 1970's.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Major Story Arcs</h2><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Host for an Alien</h3><figure style=\"width: 942px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1951627\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1951627-sleepwalk2.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.531847133758\" data-width=\"942\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1951627-sleepwalk2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1951627\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1951627-sleepwalk2.png\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1951627-sleepwalk2.png 942w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101073/1951627-sleepwalk2.png 480w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1951627-sleepwalk2.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Rick eventually discovered that the alien Sleepwalker was truly within his mind. In order to find out why the creature was inside his mind, and what his intentions where, Rick tried to communicate with him by writing and through an old tape-recorder. Sleepwalker would emerge when Rick was asleep, and would communicate back to Rick, whom would find the messages as soon as he woke up. Through this, Rick understood that Sleepwalker was a protector for the good, but was trapped inside Rick with no way out. The presence of Sleepwalker took it's toll on Rick, as he soon started to fail classes, and the relationship with his girlfriend Alyssa Conover soon got strained. This all became even worse when rival <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/whitney-cooper-iii/4005-18301/\">Whitney Cooper III </a>made the scene. Slowly he tried to lure Alyssa away from Rick. This eventually worked out, because of Rick's constant lack of attention to her, letting Alyssa feel that Rick did not want to see her. Eventually the couple broke up, but remained friends and still liked each-other very much.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Infinity Gauntlet and Death</h3><p>Rick, along with 50 percent of all beings in the Universe was instantly wiped from existence by Thanos, the Mad Titan after he got hold of the Infinity Gems. Sleepwalker however was released at the time of Rick's death and fought, alongside many other heroes, to stop Thanos. This eventually worked out, and all beings whom had seemingly died where returned to life, including Rick, whom could not remember anything.</p><h3>Sleepwalker slays Rick?</h3><p>Sleepwalker seemingly betrayed Rick during an invasion of what seemed to be other Sleepwalkers. Sleepwalker had walked up to a sleeping Rick and asked his fellow Sleepwalkers if he could be the one to kill his old host. Many heroes thought for some time that Sleepwalker had turned evil, but this was far from the truth. As it turned out, Sleepwalker had not 'slain' Rick, but actually stored his essence inside a mystical blade, having Rick to appear dead. He was however soon recovered after the invasion was averted. Later, Cobweb attacked again, but Sleepwalker defeated him for good, banishing him. Sleepwalker seemingly died afterwards. It was soon revealed that Sleepwalker did not die, he was only trapped inside Rick Sheridan's mind.</p><h3>Return</h3><p>Some years later, Sleepwalker is seen again back in the real world while he is investigating the damages of an explosion perpetuated by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ringmaster/4005-3803/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3803\">Ringmaster</a>. He however got sucked back again in Rick Sheridan's mind when Rick woke up. This apparently meant that Sleepwalker had found a way to leave Rick's mind once more when Rick fell asleep.</p><h3>The Initiative</h3><p>Some years later, Rick was recruited for the 50 States Initiative, an initiative for every American state to have it's own superhero team. Rick, having registered with the government, was put into a team with Machine Man and Arana, under the leadership of Ms. Marvel. He was given a special suit with a way to instantly fall asleep, which caused Sleepwalker to emerge when the time was needed. During his time with the Initiative, Rick confined in his teammates that his ex-girlfriend Alyssa Conover had died during a car-crash.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Fantastic Four</h3><p>Some months later, Rick Sheridan was recruited by the Fantastic Four in order to help repel an invasion of demons caused by Franklin Richard's dreams. Rick, seemingly very depressed and still mourning Alyssa's death, did however accept the invitation to help. He notified the heroes that he knew they did not come for him, but for Sleepwalker.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Psyko was the result of a merger between a <a href=\"/mindspawn/4005-18288/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18288\"> Mindspawn</a> and a human, respectively named N'ogskak and Jeremy \"Romeo\" Roscoe. The Mindspawn were creations of <a href=\"/cobweb/4005-18282/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18282\"> Cobweb</a>, resembling Sleepwalkers and having similar powers. N'ogskak was first seen as member of a small group of Mindspawn who actually thought themselves Sleepwalker's brethren. Presumably resulting from a brainwashing experiment of Cobweb or an enemy of his. Either way they joined <a href=\"/rick-sheridan/4005-18284/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18284\"> Rick Sheridan</a> (in Sleepwalker's body) in combat against Cobweb.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Psyko was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bob-budiansky/4040-10224/\">Bob Budiansky </a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bret-blevins/4040-5102/\"> Bret Blevins </a>and first appeared as N'ogskak in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sleepwalker-22-mindfield-part-4-beyond-life-and-de/4000-52027/\">Sleepwalker issue 22 </a>(1993). He first appeared as Psyko in Sleepwalker issue 28.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Becoming Psyko</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">N'ogskak turned up next as one of Cobweb's minions. Leading an invasion force towards Brooklyn. Sleepwalker challenged his former ally for leadership of the Mindspawn. N'ogskak was defeated. The Mindspawn were soon defeated thanks to the combined forces of Sleepwalker and the Avengers. They retreated back to the Mindscape. Forgetting N'ogskak behind.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He soon merged with Roscoe, becoming Psyko. His chosen host was already a serial killer with mass murderer aspirations. Psyko had all of Sleepwalker's abilities, plus the additional ability to inflict insanity on anyone hit with his own warp beams, literally driving them crazy just by looking at them. The monster began spreading mass insanity across New York.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He was faced with Sleepwalker and Spectra but proved durable to their attacks while his own powers affected them. He was eventually defeated by an overwhelming attack.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Some years later, Psyko was seen again in a flashback when Rick Sheridan was contacted by the Fantastic Four to help against demons coming from Franklin Richards' dreams.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The rarely seen natural form of the Mindspawn is vaguely insectoid with multiple eyes (5 to 7 per average) and relatively small stature (between 4 feet and 4 feet, 6 inches). In Sleepwalker-like forms their green humanoids with enhanced human agility, reflexes, stamina, speed and clearly superhuman strength and durability. The average specimen seemed to be afle to be able to lift c. 10 tons, placing them around Spider-Man's class strength-wise.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Their eyes give them superhuman vision, able to see wavelengths invisible to the human eye. Their eyes projected warp-beams able to alter the shape and durabilty of physical matter. They can possess humans and feed on the mental energies of their targets.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Psyko had a high-degree of durability to both physical and mental attacks. He demonstrated super-strength, easily lifting armored vehicles with several passengers. He had a unique to spread around madness for a variety of effects. Humans affected demonstrated murderous intent, a tendency to duel and (for some reason) largely harmless delusions. He could intentionally alter the perceptions of opponents though they maintained a degree of free-will.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Selena Slate was a laboratory assistant to <a href=\"/dr-charles-warren-fong/4005-69190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69190\"> Dr. Charles Warren Fong</a>. The two were experimenting on a synthetic diamond. Unknown to Fong, Selena had personal problems. Her boyfriend Garth was a drug addict who had trouble financing his habit. Selena, madly in love with him, agreed to steal the diamond. Hoping it was worth enough to keep Garth happy.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Spectra was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bob-budiansky/4040-10224/\">Bob Budiansky </a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bret-blevins/4040-5102/\"> Bret Blevins </a>and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sleepwalker-13-color-blindnespart-1-blinded-by-the/4000-52018/\">Sleepwalker issue 13 </a>(1992).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Becoming Spectra</h3><p>Unexpectedly, the diamond had an effect on <a href=\"/sleepwalker/4005-7601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7601\"> Sleepwalker</a>. Its light attracting him like a moth to a flame. With the alien hovering around in the lab, Selena had problems concentrating on her work. While Garth hesitated to burglarize the place. Selena figured that Sleepwalker only appeared at nights. Arranging for Garth to enter the lab during daytime.</p><p>Their plans turned wrong because of Sleepwalker's increasing addiction to the light. He arrived earlier than expected and became violent in his attempt to get to the diamond. In the general confusion, Fong set up an illusion of himself getting shot by Garth. Selena was angry and hurt, figuring Garth had broken his promise that nobody would get hurt. In an impulsive moment, Selena touched the diamond with bare hands while it was still connected the lab's power grid. A flow of energy passed through her body. Transforming her into Spectra, an energy being.</p><p>Spectra quickly grabbed the diamond and Garth before fleeing. However, her physical transformation was soon followed by an emotional one. She re-evaluated her beloved boyfriend and viewed him in a new light, as a \"good-for-nothing junkie\". She rejected him and then blasted him with solid light. Then she was confronted with another junkie, Sleepwalker still searching for the diamond. They fought intensely before Spectra discovered her own light had hypnotic effects on him. He was left hallucinating in a drugged state while Spectra flew away.</p><h3>Becoming a Hero</h3><p>Spectra resurfaced later as a vigilante most critical of Sleepwalker's faults, real and perceived. Meanwhile, he was more interested in kissing her. The two did team-up against <a href=\"/psyko/4005-18286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18286\"> Psyko</a>. The villain tried to manipulate them into killing each other. He failed.</p><p>Some years later, Spectra was seen again in a flashback when Rick Sheridan was contacted by the Fantastic Four to help against demons coming from Franklin Richards' dreams.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Powers<b> </b></h2><p> Spectra has superhuman agility, speed and the power of flight. Her body is effectively a living rainbow of energy, generating light at different frequencies and for a variety of effects. Among other things, her various light frequencies could burn through solid steel, cut through artifacts, overheat of chill the air around her, produce solid light with physical effects, project images, hypnotize and attack the nervous systems of others with waves of pain.</p><p> </p><p>She can cause hallucinations specifically to Sleepwalker and certain frequencies of her light are addictive to him. Whether she can cause similar effects to other individuals is unknown.</p>",

All four men felt a flow of intense energy and each one gained superhuman abilities. Some police arrived and Willis ripped a metal door of its hinges and used it to hit some officers.
