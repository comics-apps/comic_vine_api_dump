During questioning, however, Inquisitor learned the location of other Jedi, Niebur Boton.

He then questioned Inquisitor Pasiq regarding Sonta's whereabouts, but she no new leads.</p><p>The next day, at the headquarters of Imperial Intelligence, the Inquisitors began to look for Sonta by studying the camera and the media feeds. He was approached by Isard, who complained that Inquisitorius's parameters were too broad, and took a lot of intelligence resources. Later, Inquisitor Pasiq found a news report, including a pair of Omwati who had been attacked the night before and was rescued by a trio with seemingly superhumanability. Tremayne had no doubt that the trio were indeed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58397\" href=\"/drake-logaan/4005-58397/\" slug=\"drake-logaan\">Lo'gaan</a> and his comrades, so Tremayne began to plan a trap.</p><p>He wanted to sent the residence Omwati, but does not take into account the presence of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52797\" href=\"/boushh/4005-52797/\" slug=\"boushh\">Boushh</a>, a bounty hunter of the Black Sun, who had been responsible for the elimination of Kodo Finn Tremayne's troops stormed in, capturing the Bounty Hunter and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41234\" href=\"/jedi-order/4060-41234/\" slug=\"jedi-order\">Jedi</a>. However as Tremayne came in, Sonta escaped by jumping out a nearby window in the same way ashe did in the previous month. Frustrated again, Tremayne returned to his quarters to meditate.</p><p>While meditating, he saw Prince Xizor hitting on Inquisitor Pasiq. Xizor began to tell the truth about Tremayne's past events that not even Tremayne was aware of, including his first name. Xizor said he was aware of the search for failure. Xizor blackmailed Tremayne into giving him information about Vader.</p><p>Later Tremayne was bourght before Xizor,where the Falleen Prince had a gift for the Inquisitor.

During low altitude Assault Transport to the site, they came only to see it torn apart by explosives. Pasiq said that the Padawans had perished in the explosion, but Tremayne sensed them leaving the ship.</p><p>As Ekria jumped from the speeder, inquisitor ordered Bly to continue hunting Lo'gaan. As Lord Vader was about to leave from Platfrom NL1922 for a trip to Tepasi. Lo'gaan tried to attack vader, but the bodyguards of the Dark Lord Noghri were able to stop him. Tremayne apologized for his failure, but Vader did not care, instead just commanded the inquisitor to find the girl. However he failed, Ekria escaped to Tepasi. There both Lo'gaan and Ekria are believed to have been killed.</p><p><b>Arden Lyn and promotion</b></p><p>Tremayne along with other inquisitor, Ameesa Dary, were recruitedby the Grand Inquisitor Torbin Laddinare to assist in the capture of Arden Lyn,an elderly woman, who has been alive for over 25,000 years. She was also Teras Kasi's master, and proved more than a match for both junior inquisitors. Dary died during the fight, and Tremayne suffered serious injuries the hand of Lyn. As Torbin intervened in the fightby a severing Lyn's arm, Tremayne moved to kill, but the Grand Inquisitor had odered that Palpatine may have a use for the old warrior. however treymayne never forgot the damage Arden layn caused him.</p><p>Tremayne was eventually promoted to the elevated position of the Grand Inquisitor, and was rumored to be one of the emperor's right hand man. In fact, he was only answered to most respected advisers of Palpatine, Grand Inquisitors, but of course Palpatine himself, and Darth Vader.Since losing to Lo'gaan on the slave ship in previous years,Treymayne's lightsaber skills has increased highly. Treymayne ended up being feared throughout the Outer Rim territories, and be became infamous as a master torturer. However, the Imperial Intelligence are more than adequate for interrogation, so Tremayne spent most time looking for potential Dark Side Adepts. He soon found them in isolated communities in the form of shamans. Tremayne also had no qualms about foreign recruit who were Force-sensitive to his cause. That success soon led him to believe that he would one day rise to the position of the Grand Inquisitor.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13569/1101738-jerec_tnr.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1101738\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13569/1101738-jerec_tnr.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1101738\"><img alt=\"Jerec\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13569/1101738-jerec_tnr.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13569/1101738-jerec_tnr.jpg 500w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13569/1101738-jerec_tnr.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jerec\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13569/1101738-jerec_tnr.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13569/1101738-jerec_tnr.jpg 500w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13569/1101738-jerec_tnr.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jerec</figcaption></figure><p>While few Jedi were incorruptible, there were those who were easily manipulated to fight for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-16164\" href=\"/emperor-palpatine/4005-16164/\" slug=\"emperor-palpatine\">Emperor</a>'s cause.

No evidence or proof is needed when using LAACDoc and Moff, generals, prefects and the like could not stop those who have chosen until the investigator has come to question, and Vader supported Tremayne.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758348-jovan_vharing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1758348\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3888888888889\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758348-jovan_vharing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1758348\"><img alt=\"Jovan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-width=\"360\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758348-jovan_vharing.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758348-jovan_vharing.jpg 360w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jovan\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758348-jovan_vharing.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758348-jovan_vharing.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-width=\"360\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jovan</figcaption></figure><p>Although often mocked his master tactics and modus operandi but Tremayneas had often imitated the command style of Vader. He does not tolerate failure or delay on board the ship, and executed the officers who do not fulfill their duties to perfection. He executed Captain Nolaan and has steadily went through the eliminating all who had been Nolaan's friends except Vharing Jovan. Vharing replaced Nolaan as captain, but during an expedition through the area of space known as Nharqis'I, a calculation error has occurred. Leeds Lieutenant intercepted what he thought was a rebel transmission as Vharing was asleep, and called TIE bombers to destroy the source of the transmission.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758438-tie_bomber.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1758438\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.59166666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758438-tie_bomber.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1758438\"><img alt=\"Tie-bombers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/96875/1758438-tie_bomber.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758438-tie_bomber.jpg 600w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/96875/1758438-tie_bomber.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tie-bombers\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/96875/1758438-tie_bomber.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96875/1758438-tie_bomber.jpg 600w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/96875/1758438-tie_bomber.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tie-bombers</figcaption></figure><p>However, the atmosphere of Qlothos ravaged the missiles of the TIE Bombers, which led to death of more than sixty Imperia citizens on the Planet. Tremayne, after hearing this, Vharing was called to Tremayne's \"interview\" room. Vharing left waiting outside the room for a long time, shaken with fear. After three hours of waiting, Vharing was allowed to come in the room only to end up having his neck broken by Tremayne. Soon Tremayne remined all under his command what waits them if they do not follow his orders.</p><p>Many years later, Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin tried a coup d'etat, and seized the Emperor Palpatine inthe Imperial Centre with the help of former right hand of the emperor, Arden Lyn. Tremayne helped Lord Vader and Maarek Stele to thwart to stop the attempt, as the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47455\" href=\"/admiral-thrawn/4005-47455/\" slug=\"admiral-thrawn\">Grand Admiral Thrawn</a> was given the order to hunt down Zaarin, Tremayne was given to the task to find Lyn. The inquisitor was still bitterabout the beating he had received years before by Lyn,but was unable to find or kill her.</p><p>When an inquisitor named Adalric Brandl turned rogue and left the Empire, Tremayne was sent to capture him. He was able to catch Brandl, and inflicted a wound in the hand of the fugitives, but the fugitive escaped to Najiba. Soon after, Brandl was captured by Etnam's flagship. Tremayne was Contacted Etnam, who was willing to allow Tremayne to \"interview\" Brandl. However, Brandl has managed to fool Etnam and fake his own death before Tremayne arrived.</p><h2>Powers and abilities</h2><p>Originally Tremayne's greatest asset was his ability to exploit opportunities, other than his actual capability to use the Force. While he was able to defeat his fellow inquisitors into battle, it was hard for him to get <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58397\" href=\"/drake-logaan/4005-58397/\" slug=\"drake-logaan\">Drake Lo'gaan</a>. He also defeated humiliatingly by Arden Lyn. In the following years he improved his dueling skills to the point that he thought was very adept. His skills would serve him well against Darrin Arkanian, but once again failed him when he faced Corwin Shelvay.</p><p>Tremayne turned more skillful and was the able to extract information on the prisoners. <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45742\" href=\"/empire/4060-45742/\" slug=\"empire\">Empire</a> and intelligence COMPNOR were generally quite effective in dealing with those prisoners, but in special cases they delivered to their Inquisitorius the quarries. Moving away from the more cruel interrogation style of his master, he often playing a psychological fear with his victims before he began the interview. he would often portray himself as the victim's \"friend\" and lead them in a delicate debate to loosen their tongues and allow himself to collect the relevant information. If that failed he would move to a more \"persuasive\" ways that would usually kill or seriously wound the subject. Tremayne was notorious for being master of torture, and very few were able to survived his \"interrogation\".</p><p>Tremayne was also infamous for his ability to convert adherents to the cause of Inquisitorius. He managed to locate <a data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\" href=\"/the-force/4015-50253/\" slug=\"the-force\">Force</a>-sensitive individuals in the far away worlds. Would never pass up the opportunity to convert someone, and portrayed joining the Inquisitorius as an attractive option for his victims.</p>",

Although she appears youthful, she was born sometime around 1957, and youthfulness is just one of her many gifts. Elsa's one and only goal is to live on the Moon, her home, the one place where she can feel safe and although she had worked so hard to attain it, when she finally got there she found Lucifer Morningstar waiting and he sent her packing, giving her a mission of destroying all the devil-worshipers her father had created. She leaves angrily because she knows her powers are nothing next to his and begins to seek out her Trinity.<br/><br/>Enlisting the help of her boyfriend and her girlfriend, she has them perform with her a sex ritual that allows her to locate her maiden, Sook, whom she then takes with her, planning for the two of them to return to the home she lived in, decades ago. Elsa and Sook are attacked soon however by General Filson, who is flying a craft her father had created many a year ago, they succeed in escaping him but only when Sook uses a massive amount of power. Eventually they arrive at the house which they find is now inhabited by Nikola Draconis, a porn producer, Elsa falls in love with him as if under a spell and the two go to bed with one another only to be interrupted by Sook.<br/><br/>Than new problems come to hand as they realize Nikola is the villain, but they are saved, oddly enough by Lucifer who tells Elsa she should get back to work, than he leaves and she returns to her mission, joined by Helen and Kara, the 4 use their powers to get to New Mexico where there target, Filson, is waiting for them, as he needs Elsa to perform a spell that will seal his power, the two need to have intercourse. She is helpless to stop him and begins to age but help comes in the form of her two newfound friends and she manages to escape Filson, returning to the Moon, at ease because she realized Lucifer did this to help her, not to hinder her, for on the journey she had reconciled with a friend, something she thought she would always have had to live with.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Sook Lee is introduced as a Korean immigrant to the United States living in Dallas, Texas. When we first see her she is with her boyfriend, Chip, a young man who seems to be very intent on getting inside her pants. But she wants to do something else, take her father's car and go driving, for a thrill ride. He eventually gives in and she assures him nothing bad ever happens to her...the two get in an accident. She is later revealed to have been unharmed, due to her \"magics\" but he is hospitalized and no longer able to play football causing everyone to hate Sook, except for him.<br/><br/>He comes to realize she is a witch, and ends up falling madly in love with her, she does her best to help him but eventually she is pulled away from all of this when Elsa Grimston comes to her house, and tells her she is the maiden of the Trinity, and that Elsa will teach her how to control her magics better. Sook agrees and the two disappear, reappearing in Alta Delta, California where Elsa lived over 40 years ago.<br/><br/>They enter the house to find Nikola Draconis, a porn producer of sorts, the experience at his house ends up stealing away Sook's innocence as well as having her encounter some other magic users who make her go through a terrible experience. From that moment on she seems capable of using her powers, and changes her look, the downside is that she also seems a lot more empty on the inside. In the end, she, Elsa, Helen and Kara do what they were meant to do and succeed, Lucifer's mission being completed.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>When masters of the troops die in the clone wars we see Zonder, Drake Lo'gaan and Ekria group together as a small team with new leaders; Aayla Secura and Barriss Offee. Erika being a skilled swordsman aided Secura in a rescue mission of one of the new leaders, Barriss Offee, but ran into heavy fire. Ekria, alone, managed to escape and returned to Zonder and Lo'gaan to form a small trio and survived, against all odds, in the Great Jedi Purge (a war).</p><p>It was no surprise that the three would encounter trouble in this war, but ho would have guessed that Darth Vader himself would have kidnapped one of the three; Lo'gaan. Ekria fought bravely to rescue him. Ekria rescued him successfully in a tight squeeze and following this event she used her astute knowledge (and hacking skills) to erase all data of the trio from all databases so the 3 would never be threaten by such forces again.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Ekria is a character created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-57471\" href=\"/paul-ens/4040-57471/\" slug=\"paul-ens\">Paul Ens</a> for the Star Wars Expanded Universe and did not appear in the films. She first appeared in the Evasive Action Web-Comics. She is based on Ens' favorite Star Wars character Zakarisz Ghent, a character from the Thrawn Trilogy who is also a Barolian. Ekria isn't a main character and therefore it is hard to trace any of her appearances, apart from the Star Wars Encyclopaedia.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>She is said to be an attractive female with various gadgets and weapons such as laser pistols and laser rifles. She has excellent swordsmanship with her lightsaber and her being a jedi its no surprise she has Telekinesis. She has astute knowledge along with excellent technique with an arsenal of weapons.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Ekria has virbrant purple hair with supposed brown eyes and often wears a cloak in a greenish-gray color. Her height is 5ft7 and weight is approximately 85lbs.</p>",

Kil'jaeden apprehended the fleeing orcish shaman Ner'zhul and enacted the blood pact he had previuosly sworn. The demon lord totally destroyed the orc's body and trapped his spirit along with a suit of armor and the runeblade Frostmourne in a block of ice atop the frozen throne at the bottom of a rift inside icecrown citadel in the continent of Northrend. The Lich King was given power over the undead. The dreadlords lead by Tichondrius were assigned to be the jailors of The Lich King.</p><p> </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Lich King character was created by Blizzard Entertainment as a villain and major faction leader for their Warcraft video game series.</p><p> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Scourge of Lordaeron</h3><p>Soon after that the invasion of the human kingdom of Lordaeron begins The Lich King sends one of his necromancers named Kel'thuzad to infect the granaries throughout Lordaeron. Arthas Menethil, the young crown prince of Lordaeron and a Knight of the silver hand is assigned by his father King Terenas Menethil to investigate the infections along with the young sorceress Jaina Proudmoore. As the party investigates they arrive upon a village preparing to defend against the undead inavasion. Seeing they are vastly outnumbered Arthas sends Jaina to his mentor Uther the lightbringer for reinforcements and prepares to defend the village with his small band of warriors. As the defenders are about to be overwhelmed, Uther and Jaina arrive with reinforcements to save the day. Next, the party marches towards the city of Stratholme. Upon arriving, they discover that the entire city has been infected by the dreadlord Mal'ganis and the population is turning into undeads. Arthas decides to cull the entire populace, however some of the knights including Uther and Jaina refuse to slaughter their countrymen. This leads to Arthas to disband and dismiss the Kinghts of the silver hand. Then, Arthas proceeds with the culling and fights back the undead. Arthas succeeds in sacking the entire populace but Mal'ganis escapes to the icy continent of Northrend. Arthas decides to follow the dreadlord to Northrend and takes the army with him. At Northrend, Arthas retrieves the powerful runeblade Frostmourne and uses its power to kill Mal'ganis and extract his vengeance. However it is revealed that the Frostmourne belonged to the Lich King and all the venets were being orchestrated by him all along. He wanted Arthas as his champion death knight.</p><p>Months later a fully corrupt Arthas returns to Lordaeron amidst a hero's welcome. However he murders his father in the throne room and starts the invasion of Lordaeron on behalf of the Scourge. Arthas then raises his dead steed \"Invincible\" and proceeds to kill his former comrades including his mentor Uther.</p><h3>The Second Invasion</h3><p>After the conquest of Lordaeron, Arthas and his forces invade the elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas. Although he is met by heavy resistance from Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner his forces gradually push towards the capital city of Silvermoon. Arthas finally defeats and kills Sylvanas but as a punishment for her insolence he raises her back as a banshee to do his bidding. He then defeats King Anasterian Sunstrider with minimal effort and his undead army razes Silvermoon to the ground. Arthas then resurrects the necromancer Kel'thuzad as a Lich using the power of the Sunwell.</p><p>The pair then travels to Dalaran, the mages' seat of power. Although met with valiant resistance, the Scourge fights through the magical defenses and kills the Archmage Antonidas. Kel'thuzad uses the Book of Medivh to summon the demon lord Archimonde to Azeroth and thus the spark the third demonic invasion of Azeroth.</p><h3>The Frozen Throne</h3><p>After the defeat of the demon lord Archimonde at Mount Hyjal by the combined forces of humans, orcs and night elves, Arthas returned to Lordaeron to reclaim his throne. He chased away the three demonic Dreadlords ruling Lordaeron and crushed the human resistance along with Sylvanas and Kel'thuzad. However, Arthas has a painful seizure during the battle and feels his power diminishing and hears the Lich King calling out to him.</p><p>Arthas' powers continue to dwindle while Sylvanas breaks free from the Lich King's control and attends a meeting with the dreadlords to ambush and kill off Arthas. As Arthas fights off the dreadlords but he is ambushed by Sylvanas and her banshees. Kel'thuzad arrives just in time and chases away the banshees.</p><p>Soon after, Arthas receives a mental cry from the Lich King who tells him to return to the Frozen Throne and defend it against the night elf Illidian who was been empowered by the demon lord Kil'jaeden to destroy it and his naga followers .Arthas gathered his army and headed for Northrend. After a desperate race against time, Arthas faced Illidian at the foot of the Frozen Throne in a climatic battle. After he soundly defeats the Illidan, Arthas ascends the Frozen Throne and shatters the Lich King's icy prison to become one with the Lich King.</p><p>It is later revealed that Arthas deemed Ner'zhul's spirit to be too weak and suppressed it to become the dominant personality of The Lich King.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Kara's story starts out on a plane, making out with her boyfriend, the teen singing sensation, Osiris, God of the Dead (not actually the God of Death, just his stage name) but suddenly the plane goes out of whack and begins to plummet, thankfully no one is harmed as the plane does not crash. From that point on, Kara is revealed to also be a singer, but she's just the opener for Osiris on their tour and often booed off the stage because nobody really wants to hear her. A quirk about her traveling is that her mother, a sorceress of sorts travels with them, serving Osiris with her mediocre magics. <br/><br/>Anyways, while at one concert, Kara is knocked off the stage into the ground where a young man encourages his friend to rape Kara, she freaks and her magic begins to show itself as her stuffed cat shows its own mystic ability and devours the young man with a slew of cats.<br/><br/>Eventually this leads to a journey of Kara discovering her \"Witching\" as she is followed around by the ghost of the boy who was told to rape her (but never actually wanted to). Kara leaves her mother and boyfriend when she finds them having sex together, although her mother says its just part of a spell (which is true, although Osiris probably doesn't see it that way). Kara starts to become her own woman, though she finds her past brought to her whenever people recognize her for her bosoms that seem to be so renown.<br/><br/>Finally, Kara ends up alongside her mother, Helen, at the former house of Henry Grimston where they join Sook and Elsa. All of them, minus Helen, end up in New Mexico where there purpose is to be fulfilled. Kara and Sook are initially taken prisoner, by Osiris nonetheless, but they both escape and help Elsa defeat the General, and Kara parts with her cat, begging the question as to whether she retains any of her abilities.</p>",

He is the action hero star of 'Bush Ranger' made it to #1 in the US, Australia and Europe, receiving over $100 million dollars at the box office. <br/><br/>At the premier party the law finally caught up with him. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\">   Peter Parker</a> was there because <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\" href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" slug=\"mary-jane\">  Mary Jane</a>'s producers were distributing the movie in the US. Instead of going in he transformed into Megawatt and fled, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\"> Spider-Man</a> followed. Spider-Man defeated him but he escaped the police and ran to Australia again. <br/><br/>Because of his star power, Koolabar paid for their top lawyers to defend him.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Cleavon Twain grew up in Louisana and wanted to be like his brother <a href=\"/cody-twain/4005-87648/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87648\">Cody</a>. Despite his brother's admiration, Cody didn't particularly like Cleavon and even killed his dog in front of him when the animal bit him. The two brothers fell apart as time went on and Cleavon became a mercenary for hire known as Vassal. He was hired by <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> to do criminal activities on his behalf and was equipped with gear designed by Osborn, including a giant energy-powered battle axe and a early proto-type of Osborn's own goblin glider. He adopted the name Headsman and set out to help Osborn gain control of the criminal underworld.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Headsman was created by <a href=\"/kurt-busiek/4040-41741/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41741\">Kurt Busiek</a> and <a href=\"/pat-olliffe/4040-21610/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-21610\">Pat Olliffe</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/untold-tales-of-spider-man/4050-5562/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5562\">Untold Tales of Spider-Man</a> #8.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Headsman was introduced and pretty sharply forgotten among the incredibly large and memorably rogues gallery of <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>. It was until <a href=\"/andy-diggle/4040-42437/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42437\">Andy Diggle</a> brought the character back as a member of Norman Osborn's <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a> team during <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a> that he became anything more than a Z-list Spider-villain. While with the team, he acted as the Green Goblin from time-to-time and was one of the more \"heroic\" members of the team. He however didn't receive the chance to truly redeem himself in the eyes of heroes as he was killed just prior to <a href=\"/siege/4045-55985/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55985\">Siege</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Burning Down the House</h3><p>Following the Secret Invasion, Norman Osborn assumed control of the country's security. He brought together a team of mercenaries to act as a secret wet-works squad. He recruited his former assosciate Headsman to the team to impersonate the Green Goblin and attack Air Force One. Osborn was using Headsman to help convince the public that Norman Osborn and Goblin were not the same person.</p><h3>Magnum Opus</h3><p>Headsman next mission was to hunt down the mercenary <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a> and silence him since he was a constant thorn in Norman's side. After a seemingly endless game of Cat and Mouse, the Thunderbolts caught Deadpool and Headsman delivered a decapitating blow to him while he was on his knees. Alas, again Deadpool returned alive due to his healing factor.</p><h3>Widowmaker</h3><p>In their next mission to recruit <a href=\"/mister-x/4005-15623/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15623\">Mister X</a>, Headsman was told by <a href=\"/ghost/4005-17638/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17638\">Ghost</a> that he had saved his life twice. When he questioned Ghost about the second time he learned that during his first mission with the team Osborn had purposely given him a faulty Green Goblin glider, since Osborn considered him disposable and a loose end.</p><p>Upon Mr. X joining the team, he mocked Headsman on multiple occasions and even defeated him after provoking Headsman to fight him. The tensions between the two men were high and when the team were ordered to execute <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a> and <a href=\"/songbird/4005-3281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3281\">Songbird</a>, Headsman (as well as Ghost and <a href=\"/paladin/4005-10584/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10584\">Paladin</a>) turned on their team-mates. Headsman was again defeated by Mister X and only seconds away from being killed by him when Ghost again saved his life.</p><h3>Siege</h3><p>The Thunderbolts were sent on a mission to capture the <a href=\"/agents-of-atlas/4060-40959/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40959\">Agents of Atlas</a>, Headsman befriend his team-mate <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/eric-ogrady/4005-6774/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6774\">Ant-Man</a> when Headsman began pondering his past and his current life. As the Thunderbolts fought against Atlas, <a href=\"/nuke/4005-41866/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41866\">Scourge</a> had his mind tampered with by <a href=\"/the-uranian/4005-2153/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2153\">Marvel Boy</a> and had the mental command placed in his mind to kill Norman Osborn on sight.</p><p>While on their jet on the way back, Osborn gave the Thunderbolts a briefing for their next mission through a hologram message. Nuke, following Marvel Boy's mental command, shot at the hologram - the bullet travelling through it and hitting Headsman in the head, killing him.</p><h3>Heroic Age</h3><p>Follwoing Headsman's death, Ant-Man paid a visit to Cody Twain and told him of his brother's final days and his actions with the Thunderbolts and his desire to do something better with his life. Ant-Man gave Cody his brother's Headsman gear as Cody was left to ponder if he should follow in his brother's footsteps.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Headsman is a well-trained fighter with great muscle strength. He flies a prototype version of Norman Osborn's Green Goblin Glider and uses a energy-powered battle axe which is powered by a circuit on his back.</p>",

This suit contained his bio-helium that formed part of his internal organs. This gas also served to keep him aloft. His suit also helped him to move about at, at minimum, directed motion hovering speed, probably faster. However, once breached, the suit and head became floppy. It may be that the suit did not match his cherubim features.<br />He was four-fingered (including a \"thumb\") and had yellow skin and matching yellow eyes (plus white pupils), with gray-blue hair and a thick gray-blue tuft of hair at the top of his head. He had light blue vomit.</p>",

They did that for awhile until that one night when their lives changed forever. As they attempted to rob another store, they bumped into a stranger who was unfortunate to be there and forced him to surrender the goods. As the biker chicks pointed their guns to his head, little did they realize they were interrogating the <a href=\"/riddler/4005-3718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\">Riddler</a> who too was breaking in to the same store and was at the start of his criminal career. Before this, The Riddler was actually looking for some thugs that he could hire to do his bidding (But failed miserably) and after seeing these two \"kindred souls\", he saw potentials with these girls and immediately hired them. He named them Query and Echo.</p><p> </p><h3>Skills and Abilities</h3><p>Query has great combat skills and agile, much like Echo too<b> </b></p><p> </p><h3>Continuation and Additional Info</h3><p>Query has not appeared in any new Batman issues for a long time. Very little is known about Query due to her limited appearances. She and Echo did however made a short comeback in the DC Comics: Origins Card game created by Upper Deck Entertainment.

They did that for awhile until that one night when their lives changed forever. As they attempted to rob another store, they bumped into a stranger who was unfortunate to be there and forced him to surrender the goods. As the biker chicks pointed their guns to his head, little did they realize they were interrogating the <a href=\"/riddler/4005-3718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\">Riddler</a> who too was breaking in to the same store and was at the start of his criminal career. Before this, The Riddler was actually looking for some thugs that he could hire to do his bidding (But failed miserably) and after seeing these two \"kindred souls\", he saw potentials with these girls and immediately hired them. He named them Query and Echo.</p><p> </p><h3>Skills and Abilities</h3><p> </p><p>Echo has great combat skills and agile, much like Query too. </p><p> </p><h3>Continuation and Additional Info</h3><p>Echo has not appeared in any new Batman issues for a long time. Very little is known about Echo due to her limited appearances. She and Query did however made a short comeback in the DC Comics: Origins Card game created by Upper Deck Entertainment. Their card number is DOR-076.</p>",

    "description": "<h4>Disney version:</h4><p>Megara sold her soul to Hades in order to save her boyfriend's life, but instead he repayed her by running away with another woman, and leaving Meg in the possession of the god of the Underworld. Meg is thus determined to never fall in love with anyone ever again. Hades uses her as a main device in his plot to defeat Hercules, and offers to give her freedom in return for finding out Hercules' weakness. She finds herself falling in love with Hercules instead, though she doesn’t want to admit it, and tells Hades that Hercules has no weakness.</p><p> </p><p>Hades eventually realises that Meg is actually Hercules' weakness. He strikes a deal with Hercules; to give up his strength for 24 hours, with the promise that a chained Meg will be safe. Hercules agrees, as Hades spitefully reveals that Meg was working for him all along. His heart broken, Hercules loses the will to fight the Cyclops Hades turns upon him. Determined to help and save her love, Meg finds Pegasus and finds Phil, persuading him to come back and help Hercules regain his confidence once again.</p><p> </p><p>After Hercules manages to defeat the Cyclops using his wits, Meg sees a pillar collapsing and pushes Hercules out of the way. Instead, she gets crushed by the pillar. Meg got hurt, which breaks Hades' contract. Hercules also regains his strength once again, and Meg finally admits her love for Hercules. Hercules makes a promise to Meg that she will be okay, and leaves her in Phil's care while he goes to stop Hades taking over Mount Olympus.</p><p> </p><p>After saving Olympus, Hercules races back to be with Meg, but arrives seconds after she died. Hercules then makes a trip to the Underworld, and rescues her soul, which brings her back to life and makes him a True Hero. Meg and Hercules then travel to the gates of Olympus where Meg watches Hercules enter the gates. Being mortal, she cannot follow. However, Hercules realizes that he wants to be with Meg, and gives up his chance to be a god on Mount Olympus in order to live a mortal life on Earth with her. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Eary Life</h2><p>Bentley's first memories are that of Happy Camper Orphanage not knowing who his parents were, and if they were alive or dead and if alive where. Well Bentley was the first at the orphanage and that is where Sly, Bentley and Murrary met. They soon became like family. Soon the 3 realized that their skills meshed perfectly together and they soon became The Cooper Gang.</p><p>As the yrs went by Sly and Murrary grew bigger and more muscular while he just grew height wise and only by just a bit.</p><h3><span id=\"Sly_Cooper_and_the_Thievius_Raccoonus\"><i>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus</i></span></h3><p>The 3 throughout their adventures encounter the members of the Fiendish 5, each time Bentley concocts a plan to get them through each mission against the 5 members.</p><p>When Sly was dying from the Poison Gas, Bentley hacked the system and saved his life.</p><h2>Sly 2: Band Of Thieves</h2><p>In this one Bentley goes on his first mission and becomes the Team's resident Demolitions expert. In this one he also has greater strategy. As opposed to his being timid in the 1st one he is now on the field working to get the Clockwerk parts.</p><p>When the team is captured by the Contessa he is the only member around and he saves them singlehandedly. After that he fights and defeats Rajan amongst other things.</p><p>Unfortunately at the end his legs are broken and Murrary carries him away.</p><h2>In Between Sly 2 and 3</h2><p>Sly and Murrary recover Bentley from the hospital. Bentley says how he feels like he is a burden to the team to which Sly says no and they take him back to their HQ.</p><p>Murrary later on leaves to learn the Dream Time from the Guru and this upsets the team greatly. Bentley also builds and improves his wheel chair turning his weakness into a new strength which greatly enhances manuverability, thief skills, and combat.</p><p>He was also with Sly when he heard about the Cooper vault and this became his new obsession and he is the one to tell what they need in the new recruits.</p><h2>Sly 3: Honor Amongst Thieves</h2><p>The First thing they do is get Murrary back in the gang and then they travel to the Outback where they free it from the miners and save the Guru. After Guru joins Bentley determines they need a RC specialist and so they travel to Holland where they recruit Penelope.</p><p>Bentley next says they need a Demolitions Expert and so they travel to China to get the Panda King...when Sly said no to his joining Bentley insisted he was needed. After saving the Panda King's daughter they travel to Blood Bath Bay where they repay a debt to Dimitri Lousteau and after the debt is paid he joins the gang.</p><p>Soon after they go to do the Cooper Vault Job and after various missions Sly fakes Amnesia and Bentley and the Gang split.</p><p>Bentley and Penelope stayed together rebuilding the Cooper Vault and improving its security and he is at the end seen writing in the Thievius Raccoonus, showing that Sly thinks of him as a equal and that he thinks of Bentley as his equal.</p><p>At the end he is seen building a time machine,</p>",

The Confederacy implanted her with neural dampeners so her psychic power would lessen and be more controllable for the Confederates. During her time as a confederate ghost she was forced to killed hundreds of people.</p><p>Later in her life she would be saved by a Rebel leader called <a href=\"/arcturus-mengsk/4005-62236/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62236\">Arcturus Mengsk</a> who found her on a remote outpost where she was being experimented on by confederate scientists. She willingly joined his resistance group called Sons of Korhal where her combat skills would help his cause greatly in taking down the Terran Confederacy.</p><p>Later still, Mengsk became power hungry and abandoned Sarah on the world, Tarsonis, which was infected by the Zerg. This would mark the end of her human part and begin her current role as a Zerg hybrid.</p><h4>From Human to Zerg</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/622064-zerg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-622064\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.656\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:165.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/622064-zerg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-622064\"><img alt=\"Her Hybrid form\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/622064-zerg.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/622064-zerg.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>Her Hybrid form</figcaption></figure><p>The Creature that decided to keep Kerrigan and use her great power was none other then the Overmind the Ruler of all Zerg(now dead). The Overmind found out about her high psychic power and so the Overmind intergrated her into the collective of the Zerg Swarm. With her body infused with Zerg DNA her powers were augmented and her doorment powers were released which made her lead many victories for the Zerg. In her time as the one of the Overminds commnaders she was planning for power over the swarm this would be soon realised when the Overmind was killed by the Protoss Tassadar on the planet Aiur. She then manipulates the Broods of the overmind and Cerebrates which lead her to gain great amounts of power. The only ones oppsing her were renegade Cerebrates trying to create a new overmind.</p><p>In the time of the Overminds death Sarrah Kerrigan began her violent rampage of ceasing control of Zerg forces killing those who got in her way she found out about a new Overmind so she manipulates the Protoss forces into helping her enliminate the new Overmind. This plan was interupted though because a new force called the UED (United Earth Directorate) took control over the new Overmind and now had power over half of Kerrigans forces but, this did not stop her. She would form a allience with the Protoss, her previous savior Arcturus Mengsk(Ruler of the Dominion) and one of the people who served with her and loved her was <a href=\"/jim-raynor/4005-62240/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62240\">Jimmy Raynor</a> to stop the UED. They did eventually stop them where Kerrigan betryed them and attacked them and took over the Zerg forces there. She would be confronted by this group again and would defeat them all this made her Ruler of all Zerg and shows how power her intellect is.</p><p> </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Kerrigan was created by Blizzard Entertainment as one of the main protagonists for their popular RTS game Starcraft.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Superhuman Strength</p><p>Superhuman Speed</p><p>Regenerative Healing Factor</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Video Games</h3><p><strong>StarCraft</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/637184-starcraft_front_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637184\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.97906976744186\" data-width=\"430\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 430px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/637184-starcraft_front_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637184\"><img alt=\"First Game\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" data-width=\"430\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/637184-starcraft_front_cover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/637184-starcraft_front_cover.jpg 430w\"><noscript><img alt=\"First Game\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/637184-starcraft_front_cover.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30515/637184-starcraft_front_cover.jpg 430w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" data-width=\"430\"></noscript></a><figcaption>First Game</figcaption></figure><p>In the first Starcraft Game we are introduced to the Character of Sarah Kerrigan and are shown her journey from being a Ghost to becoming the \"Queen of Blades\".</p><p><strong>Starcraft 2</strong></p><p>In the second Starcraft game the main antagonist runs into Kerrigan at several occasions as they race to collect fragments of an ancient Xel'naga artifact that is later re-assembled by Jim Raynor and used to un-infest Kerrigan during an all out assault at the Zerg home planet of Char.</p><p><strong>Starcraft 2: Heart Of The Swarm</strong></p><p>In this expansion you take on the role of Kerrigan as she struggles with her newfound humanity, eventually some hard decision's will have to be made to decide the future of the zerg or perhaps the entire world.</p><p><strong>Heroes Of The Storm</strong></p><p>The Queen Of Blades will be a playable character in this MOBA style game.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Murray is a strong, muscular but slightly round hippopotamus who serves as the getaway driver and later team tough guy and fighter for the game's title character. He met both Sly and Bentley when the three of them were growing up in the Orphanage. Murray's driving skill came from his job as a pizza delivery boy, during which he hotwired cars and was eventually fired for dropping too many pizzas.</p><p>Murray is quite large and has an enormous appetite. He is depicted as a weakling in the first game, and unbelievably strong in the second game. Murray is by far the strongest of the Cooper trio, and arguably is also the most battle ready of the three. Murray is also known for saying some of the series' most hilarious lines (i.e. \"Another barrier stands before you. Fear not, I shall bend it like the truth!\") and having a peculiarly strong love of his Van, the team's getaway vehicle (he cried after it floated away in Sly 2 and was unstoppable in his quest to bring it back in Sly 3), having worked on it, throughout his life. Murray throughout the games wears a blue t-shirt that looks a bit too small for him, and a light blue scarf to go with his driver motif and no pants. In the second game and on Murray dons a marroon mask over his head and matching fighting gloves over his hands when donning his \"The Murray\" persona in battle. Murray also appears to wear thick rim glasses...although they could also be goggles or perhaps a strange hybrid of the two. Goggles would certainly go with his driver motif and he shows in Sly 3 that he doesn't really need glasses like Bentley does.</p><p>Murray seemed more chubby and laid back in Sly 1 and although still rotund by the second game and on, looked considerably tougher and a bit more muscular. Murray is officially listed as being 20 years old during the first game, and since the second takes place two years after Murray would be 22 by the time of <i>Sly 2</i> and 23 by the time of the third game.</p><p>Although he is generally a very nice guy, Murray has shown that he has quite a bit of repressed anger. Whether this is due to his experiences in the orphanage or something else is never explored in any of the games. This is highlighted during Episode 4 of Sly 2, where the Contessa points this out. This is also evident by his violent outbursts when any of his friends are harmed, and could also be a reason for his decision to leave the team due to feeling responsible for Bentley's injury at the end of Sly 2. Although this is quelled seemingly by Sly 3 due to his time with the aboriginal Guru, Murray still seems quite comfortable with his hot-blooded inner rage when he needs it.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>Fulgore's appearance in the first <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct/3030-18484/\">Killer Instinct</a> is the Type-01 model. His design seems to be heavily based off of an old English <a href=\"/knights/4015-56092/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56092\">Knight</a>. His head and face resemble that of a knight's helmet and mask, his red eyes slanted into a death glare and no nose or mouth, though he seems to be able to make grunts and screeches. One of the most dominant \"knight\" appearances is the feather-like extension protruding from the back of his head, as seen with most knight's helmets with feathers. The rest of his body is humanoid, having random circuitry and electrical tubing coming out of his neck and torso that powers his massive strength and intelligence.</p><p>Fulgore receives a slight design overhaul in <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct-2/3030-21952/\">Killer Instinct 2</a>/<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct-gold/3030-10614/\">Gold</a> as the Type-02 is activated. He retains a mostly similar, physical design, though he's slightly more sleek and slim, his armor appearing much sharper and polished, with streaks of metallic blue lining his arms, torso and legs. Yellow highlights and designs are also present on his chest. His metallic blades are now comprised of energy rather than metal. This is to show this Fulgore is a new, improved model over the original.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3879448\" data-ratio=\"1.8461538461538\" data-width=\"650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:184.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3879448\"><img alt=\"Fulgore Artwork (2013)\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/105264/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.png 650w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/105264/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.jpg 520w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/105264/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.jpg 346w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" data-width=\"346\"></a><figcaption>Fulgore Artwork (2013)</figcaption></figure><p>Fulgore again receives a strong overhaul to his design in <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct/3030-42896/\">Killer Instinct (2013)</a> as the formidable Type-03. His face is sleeker and more menacing, but mostly appears virtually identical to past versions. His body appears much more mechanical than the previous incarnations - joints, gears, circuitry, wires, and tubes are exposed along his entire body and back of his limbs. His mass is also distributed in an even more drastic manner, having thinner legs and a larger chest and arms. When his chest plates open, his orange, nuclear reactor core and a stamp that reads \"Mark 03\" are revealed. His plasma blades are also much longer and sharper in design, made more for stabbing this time than slashing.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Killer Instinct</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968918-fulgore_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968918\" data-ratio=\"1.2830188679245\" data-width=\"265\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 265px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968918-fulgore_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968918\"><img alt=\"Type-01 model\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968918-fulgore_5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968918-fulgore_5.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\" data-width=\"265\"></a><figcaption>Type-01 model</figcaption></figure><p>A prototype cybernetic soldier developed by <a href=\"/ultratech/4060-62030/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-62030\">Ultratech</a>, Fulgore was entered into the Killer Instinct tournament as a final test of its combat capabilities. Once its abilities are proven, mass production will begin. One of Ultratech's latest creations and possibly the most dangerous to date, Fulgore is the first in a planned series of cybersoldiers boasting state-of-the-art armouries, worked at feverishly over the last few years by a particularly erratic Ultratech genius and his team of Asian engineers. Dark rumors abound as to where the prototype's human parts originated - the kind of rumors nobody dares voice. The rumors say the human parts originated from a human organ harvesting operation based in Moscow. Before the Fulgore Mk.I model is even finished, the scientists are already working on an upgrade: and to prove the prototype's ultimate worth, it is entered into the tournament with orders to destroy all opposition.</p><h3>Ending</h3><p>The combat test of the Fulgore series assault cyborg has been a success. Mass production can now take place. After years of research, a weapon of awesome power is in the hands of Ultratech. The dawn of a robot controlled empire will soon begin. The first prototype model, Fulgore 1, is deactivated and placed in a museum. The only humans left to view it are now slaves.</p><h3>Killer Instinct 2</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/610359-killer_instinct_3_fulgore.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-610359\" data-ratio=\"1.078125\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/610359-killer_instinct_3_fulgore.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-610359\"><img alt=\"Type-02 model\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" data-width=\"593\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/610359-killer_instinct_3_fulgore.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/610359-killer_instinct_3_fulgore.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Type-02 model\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/610359-killer_instinct_3_fulgore.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15317/610359-killer_instinct_3_fulgore.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" data-width=\"593\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Type-02 model</figcaption></figure><p>The advanced and deadlier successor to the original Fulgore cyborg destroyed by <a href=\"/jago/4005-58351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58351\">Jago</a>. Activated after the time jump, its final Ultratech commands are executed... find Jago and kill him. Even before the Mk. I prototype in the vastly expensive Fulgore project was completed, the scientists at Ultratech were working frenziedly on an updated version. When the original met its match at the hands of Jago, its creator was enraged and set about beating a single directive into the Mk. II’s circuitry, turning it into a single-minded predator and an even more deadly foe than its predecessor. Unfortunately for Jago, not even the time jump has the power to stop it now.</p><h3>Endings</h3><h4>Kill Jago and <a href=\"/b-orchid/4005-58309/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58309\">Orchid</a></h4><p>Defeating Gargos has opened the way towards a new and more Robot controlled Ultratech.

Fulgore's task lies incomplete and his deadly nemesis is still alive. The error of sparing his nemesis is soon apparent. Jago tracks down Fulgore for a final confrontation.

Fulgore's failure and destruction at the hands of Jago and Orchid has sealed the fate of Ultratech.</p><h3>Killer Instinct (2013)</h3><p>Protocols reactivated. Enhanced system bootstrap complete.

The retrieval of this Fulgore unit’s brain core must be approached with EXTREME CAUTION. Multiple self-destruct and defensive mechanisms have been implemented to keep this brain core from falling into the possession of enemy corporations and/or rogue states. Unit S4.Q4NT.YX-003 is a unique model and is highly adaptable. DO NOT attempt to place its brain core in another unit that is not equipped with Ryatmag™ slot-lock as S4.Q4NT.YX-003 has been known to exhibit rebellious behavior.</p><p>Failure to follow directives contained in the FM-L documentation can lead to dismemberment, internal organ failure, chronic illness, brain damage, and death. Failure to keep FM-L information confidential will lead to heavy fines, confiscation of personal property, termination, and imprisonment in an Ultratech private prison complex.</p><h4>Step 1</h4><p>Make certain that the damaged Fulgore unit is completely inactive. Suggested tactic: Approach the unit slowly wearing full regulation Class 20 body armor with Ultrafine© deflection shield in “Max” position [see Part 102b-k: tactics for approaching apparently deactivated units of all types].</p><p>WARNING! If this Fulgore unit’s Targeting Light suddenly activates at a range of 2.5 meters the technician has two options:</p><ol><li>Evacuate area at full speed (Note: this action is problematic if technician is wearing regulation body armor.)</li><li>Depress EMP burst immediately (Note: this will fully incapacitate the unit’s electrical functions but may trigger the unit’s lithium battery powered Reflector, i.e. energy shield. Reflector will remain active for up to 18 hours. Prolonged exposure to the shield’s low frequency emission may cause one or all of the following: internal bleeding, psychotic hallucinations, depression and damage to the spleen.)</li></ol><p>If unit’s Targeting Light does not activate during approach, then proceed to Step 2.</p><h4>Step 2</h4><p>Locate cyborg’s back head plate recessed access panel #2 (matte black finish with hexagonal incised marking) and verify serial number S4.Q4NT.YX-003.</p><p>Using the proprietary barrel nut wrench [#7] with extension [#5], turn clockwise on all nuts marked with the UT symbol.</p><p>Wire Cutting:</p><ul><li>Use wire cutters to cut all red wires inside access box.</li><li>Cut the thicker yellow wire first, then proceed to cut the black wire, leaving the second fatter yellow wire attached.</li><li>If the blue “burnout” wire has not been melted, and it is still connected to the port marked “C-L9,” leave it UNCUT. If this wire is jiggled the S4.Q4NT.YX-003 unit will self-destruct immediately [see Appendix Xx1.7 for Close Proximity Explosion Survival Statistics and Standard Practices].</li></ul><p>Suggestion: Do not speak, hum, or breathe loudly during the cutting of wires: this Fulgore unit’s vibration detector is set to maximum and may initiate unexpected “Defensive Rollout Maneuver” [classified] of all remaining cyborg parts.</p><p>WARNING! Beware of random Plasma Storm burst from unit’s claws. If plasma burns through Class 20 body armor, then:</p><ul><li>Call for immediately evac and</li><li>Depress “Cooling Gel” feature on wrist control pad (Note: if wrist control pad is compromised initiate manual cooling gel application protocol.)</li></ul><h4>Step 4</h4><p>Place neodymium magnet (Ryatmag™) unlocking key in unmarked heptagram-shaped slot (see Appendix Y: Visual Dictionary of Unusual Slot Shapes) to unlock brain.</p><h4>Step 5</h4><p>Depress Ryatmag™ key with force exceeding 20kp (44lb) until neodymium magnet is flush with slot edge. WARNING! If Ryatmag™ was not placed precisely with star’s line-up marks on slot’s edge in Step 4, the Fulgore unit will let forth a single burst of its Devastation Beam [see Appendix Z4,8.73: Field Tech Beneficiaries and Funeral Arrangements Supplementary Tables, Full Time Employees (FTE) Only].</p><h4>Step 6</h4><p>Once the Ryatmag™ has been secured inside the slot the Fulgore unit’s brain is ready to be placed in its Ultrafoam™ carrying case for transportation.</p><p>Case will automatically lock with quantum-encryption code. Do not attempt to open case as self-destruction will occur. Proceed immediately to Pinnacle and deliver directly to Repurposing Lab (Sub-level 21x). [See: Access to undisclosed levels of Ultratech.]</p><p>Suggestion: Do not pick up small children for two weeks after handling brain core [see “Radiation Exposure handbook”].</p><h4>Step 8</h4><p>Don’t forget to fill out your FM-L Completed Task Report (CTR) and rate the efficacy of this manual’s section!</p><h4>ADDENDUM:</h4><p>Testing on unit S4.Q4NT.YX-003 has revealed that its eye beams were misaligned and not traveling all the way to the intended target. Laser reticles can be re-aligned in the field using the simple procedures outlined in section FM-L part 1004b—2039b pp 347-867 and FM-L Appendix 2 (2nd revised edition).</p><h3>Endings</h3><h4>Kill Fulgore, Don't Kill Orchid</h4><p>SYSTEM MALFUNCTION. KILLING BLOW ABORTED. How can a machine know mercy? Fulgore cannot ignore his imperative to destroy but human \"memories\" interfere with his machine logic. Unable to digest the echoes of a fighting spirit, Fulgore attempts to process his true nature.</p><h4>Kill Orchid, Don't Kill Fulgore</h4><p>PROTOTYPE. APPROVED. Echoes of a lost humanity have been purged from Fulgore's systems. The sum of what remains is a merciless machine, driven to destroy. Without a cycle spared to savor his victories, Fulgore begins a search for his next adversary.</p><h4>Kill Orchid and Fulgore</h4><p>Thousands of Fulgores have been created, only to be destroyed, remade, and improved upon... But this one is different. Individuality and independence now race through his circuits. Still a killing machine, Fulgore rejects his coded imperatives and ponders his next target.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Fulgore</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Height</strong>: 6'5\"</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 550 lbs</li><li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Evil</li><li><strong>Race</strong>: Cyborg</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>While there have been several different Fulgore designs created by UltraTech, they all carry similar weaponry and fighting styles. Impressive athletics, and attacks with his arm-mounted quad plasma blades that can cut through almost any metal with temperatures over 30,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Fulgore has also used a variety of energy-based weaponry, these include firing lasers from his eyes, emitting energy bursts from his plasma claws, a reflective barrier, and teleportation/some form of cloaking device.</p><p>Fulgore can change his head into a turret-like gun or change into a battle machine and shoot the opponent repeatedly.</p><p>A new addition to the third Fulgore model of Killer Instinct (2013) is the nuclear reactor core attack. Fulgore can now gradually store power by standing back and exposing the core inside of his chest. A large and powerful laser beam can also be fired from this core.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Video Games</h3><h4>Killer Instinct</h4><p>Fulgore is a playable character in the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct/3025-1017/\">Killer Instinct video game series</a>. He was voiced by Kevin Bayliss in KI and KI2 and by Jean-Edouard Miclot KI 2013.</p><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>In <i>Killer Instinct (2013)</i>, one of Chief <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/thunder/4005-78049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78049\">Thunder</a>'s endings reveals that Ultratech has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkjz84TkUc\" rel=\"nofollow\">plundered the mind</a> of his younger brother, Eagle, in order to create the artificial intelligence needed for the Fulgore Mark 03. The 5th chapter of the Killer Instinct Novella, titled \"ARIA For Noomorph\", details how ARIA utilized Eagle's brain wave patterns as a base for the cyborg's AI system, transferring them into Ultratech's most advanced Type-03 model.</li><li>Kevin Bayliss, an artist of the original Killer Instinct, claimed in his Twitter hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/killerinstinctfacts?f=realtime&amp;src=hash\" rel=\"nofollow\">#killerinstinctfacts</a> that Fulgore's sounds were created by mixing synth effects with pig squeals. They explicitly wanted him to not have a human voice, so they settled on robotic screams instead.</li><li>Fulgore's name maybe a shortened version of Belphegor (due to character size). Belphegor is demon of invention and seduces human beings to invent ingenious inventions in order to get rich (and ultimately become lazy and greedy). This mirrors what Ultratech is trying to do with Fulgore, an invention to allow Ultratech to be powerful and rich and have enough financial power to make unrest throughout the world.</li></ul>",

Instead of being vaporized like the others, his body became super heated and burst into flames. He was used as a way to train others for the Killer Instinct tournament. Eventually he forged a friendship with the alien named Glacius and turned against Ultratech. Though Glacius survived the rebellion, Cinder sadly did not, Cinder never got the cure he desired for his living inferno, but he did receive the death he was willing to settle for.</p>",

When the Oans began to tell the Zamarons that they were being naive and irresponsible that love could save the universe to which Aga'po along with her sisters told the Guardians that their problem was that they had decided to suppress emotion. During the debate, the Queen stated that the Green Lantern Corps would never have been formed had they not felt love after which she stated that she pitied the Oans for their attitude on showing no emotion.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Aga'po later told them that by abandoning emotions, they were falling into the grip of fear and grief. As the argument continued, the Queen of the Zamarons decided not to hear anymore and that she had enough of the Oans.</p><figure style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3854757\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3854757-aga%27po02.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.44791666666667\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3854757-aga%27po02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3854757\"><img alt=\"watching the Oan delegation depart Zamaron\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/3854757-aga%27po02.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3854757-aga%27po02.jpg 1920w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132823/3854757-aga%27po02.jpg 960w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/3854757-aga%27po02.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>watching the Oan delegation depart Zamaron</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">She later, however, showed a different part of the Star Sapphire base after the suggestion was made by Guy Gardner. There, she showed the conversion crystals which held captured female Sinestro Corpsmen such as Fatality, Karu-Sil and Kiriazis. When the Guardians showed further concern, Aga'po disagreed their comments stating that each of the members of the Sinestro Corps had a hole in their hearts which needed to be filled. She later expelled the Guardians from Zamaron after they refused to hear the Zamarons and Aga'po told them that their Green Lantern Corps center would not hold in the future. As the War of Light continued, the Sinestro Corps under the command of their leader Sinestro attacked Zamaron in order to reclaim their captured corpsmen.</p><figure style=\"width: 862px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3854755\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3854755-aga%27po-miri02.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.89211136890951\" data-width=\"862\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3854755-aga%27po-miri02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3854755\"><img alt=\"inducting Miri Riam into the Star Sapphire Corps\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/3854755-aga%27po-miri02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3854755-aga%27po-miri02.jpg 862w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/3854755-aga%27po-miri02.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"inducting Miri Riam into the Star Sapphire Corps\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/3854755-aga%27po-miri02.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/3854755-aga%27po-miri02.jpg 862w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/3854755-aga%27po-miri02.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>inducting Miri Riam into the Star Sapphire Corps</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There, they entered into battle with the Star Sapphires where Aga'po revealed that Carol Ferris had developed an immunity towards the Star Sapphire and that she was able to use its power without being consumed by it.

Whilst they managed to remain on their home-world and their Central Power Battery survived, it was greatly weakened without the undying love of Khufu and Chay-ara as well as the Predator Entity. The former pair provided a power that was everlasting and it was deemed by the other Zamarons to recover their remains once more. However, Queen Aga'po decided that was not to be as their remains took years to fossilize and that the bodies were now tainted by the Black Lantern Power Rings.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This left the only option being the recovery of the Predator Entity. In order to ensure the continued operations of the Star Sapphires, Aga'po began siphoning off her own immortal beauty to keep the Star Sapphire Central Power Battery temporarily lit.

They were stopped by the Star Sapphire of 2814 herself namely Carol Ferris who stated that the Zamarons did not need to imprison the Predator Entity but instead rely on faith in love to empower the Central Power Battery. But the Zamarons intended to take the Predator by force until Queen Aga'po saw the wisdom in Ferris's words.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Thus, she urged her sisters to listen to her whilst Aga'po drained whatever energy remained within her and placed it within the Star Sapphire Central Power Battery thus refueling its power. Her last words and command to her subjects was the elevation of Carol Ferris to the position of Queen after which Aga'po perished as she turned to dust.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><figure style=\"width: 252px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2741403\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120284/2741403-queen_aga_po___new_52.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3769841269841\" data-width=\"252\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120284/2741403-queen_aga_po___new_52.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2741403\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" data-width=\"252\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120284/2741403-queen_aga_po___new_52.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120284/2741403-queen_aga_po___new_52.jpg 252w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120284/2741403-queen_aga_po___new_52.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120284/2741403-queen_aga_po___new_52.jpg 252w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" data-width=\"252\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Leadership:</strong> She has been the queen of her people for untold thousands of years.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Appearance Manipulation:</strong> She has appeared in many guises over time.

Rise of the Manhunters, Queen Aga’po is the Queen Zamaron who can harness the energy of love and the sapphire violet power from the sapphire power battery. Initially she asks Hal Jordan the Green Lantern to help her defend her world from the invading forces of the Manhunters who are intent on siphoning off the violet energy to use in their dominion of the green will energy. Later she becomes possessed by the Willhunters Manhunter worms and turns on Hal, and Hal has to fight her.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">To defeat Queen Aga’po, one must know her various moves, which include a fast attack that will chop Hal Jordan to bits. Avoid this attack at all costs. This attack is avoided by being far away from Queen Aga’po and avoiding being crystal frozen by the Queen. Next she can throw down a circle of freezing crystal attack. Avoid this by dodging out of the way as soon as the yellow ring appears. Next defeat her warriors fast, using the storm of mace, and machine gun construct.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Queen Aga’po will send in her soldiers about three to four times and jump into the air safely away from Hal’s attacks. Destroy the Queen’s soldiers, and when the queen comes back into the arena, aim the machine gun construct at Aga'po and fire continuously. There should be ring surge energy left to do one ring surge power. Use this wisely, preferably at the end of the fight when Hal Jordan’s health points are very low.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Once Queen Aga’po is defeated, the game continues into fighter jet mode, with Hal flying through space and launching missiles and ammunition at the various Manhunters and Willhunters. This will culminate in the Manhunter ultra at the end. This fight is easy in Hal Jordan mode for dodging but the attack is weak. Conversely, when Hal turns into a jet, the dodging ability is less, but aim for maximal power against the Manhunter ultra.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Next up, the green lantern rise of the Manhunter walk-through continues with the entry into the Violet Hall.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Defeating the Zamaron Defender</strong></p><figure style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4246913\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4246913\"><img alt=\"The Zamaron Defender appears\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg 1280w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Zamaron Defender appears\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg 1280w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4246913-5248551430-maxre.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Zamaron Defender appears</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Aga'po summons the Zamaron Defender to defeat the Green Lantern Hal Jordan.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Green Lantern Defeating the Zamaron Defender tactics is based on knowing the various movies of the Zamaron Defender.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Zamaron Defender has the following moves. It can use a wide area hand swipe to floor Jordan. Next it can summon two Willhunters to attack Jordan. The Willhunters can spit out bolts of energy which Jordan has to dodge. Ironically, this is the time when the Zamaron Defender will be at the weakest, so launch lots of Gatling Gun attacks at the Zamaron Defender. Next the Zamaron Defender can claw her hands into the ground and cause electricity arcs to vibrate between her hands. Jump into the air and dodge this. The Zamaron Defender can also slam her hands into the ground, causing a mini earthquake and then causing crystals to erupt from the ground. Dodge out of the way by jumping and hiding in the right hand corner of the arena fight. The Zamaron Defender can also cause roofs of the cavern to fall onto the ground. Again dodge out of the way. Next the Zamaron Defender can summon swirling Willhunters to swarm Jordan. Jump into the air to avoid this. The one attack which Jordan has to avoid at all costs is the energy bolt which is launched from the Zamaron Defender's mouth. This will take away a lot of Jordan's energy if it hits, so dodge out of the way at all costs.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For counterattacks on the Zamaron Defender, use the missile launcher construct initially, and then follow this up with the Gattling Gun construct when the attack is over. With patient, perseverance and skills, the Zamaron Defender will be defeated.</p>",

    "deck": "Formerly Ryan Choi (Atom)'s girlfriend, Jia eventually hooked up with Chronos and became known as Lady Chronos.",
    "description": "<p><a href=\"/ryan-choi/4005-2352/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2352\">Ryan Choi</a> met Jia at a dance club after he gotten his schoolyard bully expelled from college for plagiarizing. Alvin Edward Qianfan was a young member of the Triads who had big ambitions but he had no patience for his studies so he would force Choi into doing his homework. Choi outsmarted Alvin but Alvin eventually got his revenge by beating Choi nearly to death. Jia put an end to Choi's torment by telling Alvin that she would be his girl if he left Choi alone. Alvin agreed to Jia's terms and Choi was left with a broken heart. </p><p>Choi finished school and went to <a href=\"/ivy-town/4020-55825/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55825\">Ivy Town </a>to begin his career as a professor in physics while Jia married Alvin. Alvin remained a low level Triad member and he would often take his drunken rage out on Jia. Eventually Jia gathered her courage in order to put Alvin down like a rabid dog. One night, Alvin slept off his latest drinking binge and Jia took a shovel to Alvin's head repeatedly. Alvin's skull was completely caved in and Jia buried his mutilated body in an unmarked grave. </p><p>Unfortunately, Alvin didn't stay dead for too long because of <a href=\"/blackest-night/4045-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\">Blackest Night</a>. Choi gets a distressing call from Jia because she is being terrorized by Alvin but Jia fails to mention its Alvin's corpse who is stalking her. Choi heads to Kowloon, <a href=\"/hong-kong/4020-55799/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55799\">Hong Kong</a> and he gets a text from Jia stating that she will meet him at his university. When Choi arrives, he finds Jia and his father being held captive by a Black Lantern version of Alvin. Alvin tells Choi that if he kills Jia the same way she killed him then Alvin will let Choi's father go. </p><p>For a moment, Choi feels hurt because Jia's only reason for calling him was just so he could defend her from Alvin. Choi had hoped he would be a knight in shining armor but Jia didn't need Choi's company until she was in a situation that she couldn't handle. However, Choi put his hurt feelings aside and vanquished Alvin by using a series of size altering body blows. Alvin continues to taunt Choi while divulging some troubling news about Jia. </p><p>When Alvin started abusing Jia, she went looking for men who would defend her against Alvin but each man was too much of a coward to stand up to Alvin because of his involvement with the Triads so she took it upon herself to kill Alvin. Choi didn't want to hear anymore of Alvin's bile so he grabbed a lit lantern and threw at Alvin. After Alvin's corpse burned up, the <a href=\"/black-power-ring/4055-55739/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55739\">black ring</a> around his finger flew away and Jia displays her gratitude by kissing Choi but Choi pushes her away.</p><p>Choi tells Jia that he will not be her fall guy and Jia understands Choi's anger. Jia admits she used Choi simply because she knew about his recent fame as a superhero but she also confesses that deep down inside, she once loved him as more than just a friend. When Choi left Hong Kong, Jia began dating a mysterious librarian at Choi's college. She soon finds out that this librarian is the time altering thief Chronos. Jia automatically joins forces with Chronos and she decides to help him in his latest conquest against the Atom. for her own reasons.</p><p><b>Atom: Small Wonder</b></p><p>Choi begins to realize that prolonged usage of the Atom belt can cause one to shrink. Choi fears he will lose equilibrium unless he finds the source of this anomaly in his blood. Choi calls in Panda Potter to help with this endeavor. Choi has developed a diminution mapping engine that will enable him to observe the nucleus of his blood cells. Choi primarily wants to investigate the white corpuscles for any signs of radiation poisoning or tachyons since the belt has endured temporal exposure from dimensional rifts. </p><p>Unfortunately, the mapping engine was miscalibrated and Choi's blood sample became a matter displacing rift. Potter tells Choi to run before got sucked into the rift. Choi didn't want to but he knew that Potter trusted him in finding an answer to stop the rift. Choi exits his house but the rift continued to expand in size. As Choi takes a moment to breath, he is approached by city council member Matt Wilson who has brought a news crew with him. Wilson confronts Choi about his involvement with Ivy Town's recent chaos for the past couple of months. Before Choi could answer, the rift swallowed his home and made its way to his next door neighbor Amanda. </p><p>Choi makes his way through Amanda's home and finds her holding for dear life as the vacuum of the rift increases. Wilson and the news crew are sucked into the portal and Choi tries to maintain a firm grasp of Amanda but it wasn't enough. Amanda falls into the portal and Choi follows in after her. For a moment Choi was unconscious then he wakes up and finds himself floating on a hunk of wood in a crimson colored ocean. Choi is convinced at this point that his blood contains tachyons, particles which move backwards. It would seem tachyons are not only connected to the theory of time travel or dimensional rifts but they also apply to Choi's physiology which would explain his loss of inches. </p><p>As Choi gathers himself, he comes under attack by a pod of monstrous tapeworms. Choi rides the tapeworms to avoid getting eaten then he realizes these tapeworms can fly. Choi is soaring through the air on this tapeworm until he finds a island in the sky. Choi jumps off the tapeworm and uses his bangstick to repel the creature back into the depths of the crimson ocean. Choi theorizes that his blood combined with the dimensional rift has created this unusual dimension and the tapeworms must have undergone some erratic evolution when they were plucked from Earth. On the island, Choi finds the people who were sucked into the rift. Panda explains to Choi that time moves rather fast as compared to Earth's reality. A second on Earth seems like a couple of months in this dimension. </p><p>By this time, Wilson has made himself leader of the islanders and Panda has started a relationship with Amanda, Choi's neighbor. Wilson tells the islanders to expel Choi from the island because he has injured the tapeworm and they will come back in numbers as a form of retaliation. Unfortunately, Wilson was right and the tapeworms began their assault. Choi uses his bangstick to keep the tapeworms at bay while Panda tries to convince Wilson into helping Choi. Wilson refuses to listen to reason and impales Panda with a shard of glass. Choi hears Amanda scream so he slows down the tapeworms' pursuit by causing a mountainside to come crumbling down thanks to his bangstick. </p><p>Choi finds Amanda crying over Panda's lifeless body and sees Wilson making a hasty exit. Choi catches up to Wilson and begins to beat him repeatedly. Unfortunately, a tapeworm comes crashing through but Choi dodges the tapeworm and watches as it devoured Wilson. Choi felt a deep sense of gratification that his friend had been avenged but then a temporal rift opens. The rift teleports the tapeworm first then it transports Choi to the same future that he went to when he tried to help Teddy Hyatt. Choi finds himself at the mercy of Lady Chronos. Choi also notices the tapeworm has evolved even further. It now possesses appendages which enable it to walk but Wilson's mind has become the force that drives the creature.</p><p>Lady Chronos reveals that she is Jia and she invites Choi to join her in this new future. Jia asks Choi to forgive her since she used him in Hong Kong but Choi refuses to forgive or join her. Choi finally sees how deviant Jia can be. First, she seduces men into helping her kill her abusive husband Alvin and when that doesn't work, she kills Alvin herself. Afterwards, Jia used Choi to kill Alvin during Blackest Night and now she is willing to betray Chronos, her latest husband for Choi. Jia of course, is angered by Choi's spite so she tells Wilson to kill him.</p><p>Wilson and Choi fight for awhile until <a href=\"/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\">Booster Gold</a> comes crashing through this alternate timeline. Booster saves Choi by giving him a few capsules of sulfuric acid. Choi throws the capsules into Wilson's mouth and Wilson begins to dissolve from the inside. Booster takes Choi back through the timestream that he traveled. Booster and Choi rescue the wayward people from unusual dimension then they head back to the present time on New Earth.</p><p>When the portal opens, Choi finds a dozen news crews surrounding the crater that used to be his home. He also discovers Dwarfstar posing as the Atom and claiming he did all he could to save the missing citizens. Choi walks up behind Dwarfstar and pummels him to the ground. Dwarfstar is once again ridiculed by Choi but now on live television. Unfortunately, Chronos and Lady Chronos come through a temporal rift to rescue Dwarfstar. Lady Chronos asks Choi to spare Dwarfstar because Rudine is her son.</p><p>Choi reluctantly agrees and lets Dwarfstar stumble away in shame with the Chronos couple. When all was said and done, Choi asks Booster how he knew about his current predicament. It turns out Ray Palmer has been observing Choi's recent exploits and called in Booster when things were going awry. Choi tells the news crews that he is responsible for this latest mishap and he will accept the consequences. Booster of course, takes the initiative by grabbing Choi from prison and teleporting him to the future because Lady Chronos is wreaking havoc in Booster's present time.</p><p><b>Booster Gold: Stars in Your Eyes</b></p><p>Her romantic entanglements with Ryan Choi, Chronos and now Booster Gold, have caused her to remain undecided on where her allegiances lie. She was last seen helping Booster Gold defeat Starro's temporal conquest of the past and the future. After a brief kiss of passion between her and Booster, Jia returns to Chronos' side as they travel down the timestream once again. Starro iodine</p>",

    "description": "<p>La Bruja (The Witch) is a sorceress of presumed Mexican origin. She slept with Satan to seal a deal with him. As a result she could stay immortal, as long as she managed to absorb the life force, memories, emotions, and dreams of men. Something which she accomplished with a single kiss. She and her daughter resided on a hill house, somewhere in the Sierra Madre mountain range.</p><p>The locals offered her a weekly human sacrifice (determined by lottery), in exchange for her protection and assistance with their daily lives. When Jackie Estacado stopped in the town to get gas for his motorcycle, the locals attacked him. Planning to use the stranger as their sacrifice for the week. But La Bruja's daughter decided to recruit him for her own purposes. If her mother died, the girl would inherit all her powers. So she hired Jackie to assassinate her mother.</p><p>Jackie prooved completely outclassed in the resulting strength. Her superhuman smell enabled her to detect her daughter's scent on him, easily deducing his purpose. She shape-shifted her legs to an octopps-like form and then jumped him. La Bruja demonstrated vast superhuman strength, superior to his own. Continuing with demonstrating her telekinesis, first to seal his mouth and then to levitate him above the ground. She finally claimed his kiss and his soul.</p><p>The powers and memories of Jackie proved poisonous to La Bruja, killing her instantly. Before returning to Jackie.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Biography</h2><p>A <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57660\" href=\"/selonians/4060-57660/\" slug=\"selonians\">Selonian</a> from Selonia, Zonder was a force-sensitive being, and was one of several children. He was eventually brought into the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41234\" href=\"/jedi-order/4060-41234/\" slug=\"jedi-order\">Jedi Order</a>, and although he was adept at telekinesis, he was not particularly skilled at <a data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\" href=\"/lightsaber/4055-44097/\" slug=\"lightsaber\">lightsaber</a> combat. During the Clone Wars, Zonder was apprenticed to Jed Knight <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48318\" href=\"/barriss-offee/4005-48318/\" slug=\"barriss-offee\">Barriss Offee</a>. Offee, a healer, was sent to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56940\" href=\"/felucia/4020-56940/\" slug=\"felucia\">Felucia</a> along with her new Padawan to work as a healer to the natives who had been injured in the recent Republic attack on the world. Since Felucia was a Confederate world, Zonder and Offee had to work undercover, posing as relief workers, operating without the help of their lightsabers. While healing one day, the pair spotted Shu Mai, a key figure in the Confederate leadership, and Offee believed that the capture of such a figure would be a great boon to the Republic's cause. As the pair secretly attempted to contact the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45051\" href=\"/the-jedi-high-council/4060-45051/\" slug=\"the-jedi-high-council\">Jedi Council</a> on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-48936\" href=\"/coruscant/4020-48936/\" slug=\"coruscant\">Coruscant</a>, they were set upon by a detachment of enemy battle droids.</p><p>Departing their hut swiftly, Zonder urged his master to stay where she was. Evading the enemy blaster fire, he dropped a slab of stone on the B1 battle droids, to the delight of Offee. The pair then began their dash to the executive landing platform, where there was a transmission facility. Along the way, they were confronted by droidekas, prompting the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\" href=\"/jedi/4015-52199/\" slug=\"jedi\">Jedi</a> to split up. Leaping to higher ground, Zonder was soon faced with Hunter-Seeker droids, which he promptly destroyed. The resulting explosion, however, threatened to kill two nearby Gossam children, forcing Offee to stop her evasion of the enemy droids and save the innocent bystanders. As a result, she was captured, and urged Zonder to stand down. He complied, and the pair were taken into Confederate custody.</p><p>They were held at the nearby Nigkoe Detention Facility for some time, until a task force led by General <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5389\" href=\"/aayla-secura/4005-5389/\" slug=\"aayla-secura\">Aayla Secura</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47045\" href=\"/clone-commander-bly/4005-47045/\" slug=\"clone-commander-bly\">Commander CC-5052</a> broke into the facility and freed Offee and Zonder. Helping them was the Padawan <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58405\" href=\"/ekria/4005-58405/\" slug=\"ekria\">Ekria</a>, who, in trying to find the group a way out of Nigkoe, realized that they wouldn't be able to descend from the facility, as there was a considerable staging area for Confederate troops below. Zonder and CC-5052, known as \"Bly,\" concurred in thinking that the best option for their escape would be to ascend the building. Picking up Offee and Ekria, Zonder leapt to the top of Nigkoe, while Bly and Secura rappelled up. Bly then destroyed the facility's shield generator, allowing the 327th Str Corps to descend and pick the group up.</p><p>Offee requested that she and Zonder be able to collect their lightsabers and personal effects from the facility, while Secura revealed that Coruscant had fallen under attack by the Confederacy. Despite the situation, she insisted that they capture Mai before leaving for the capital, hoping to extract any information as to the Confederate plan from the leader of the Commerce Guild. The Jedi made their way to Mai's compound near Kway Teow, and, after eliminating the perimeter guard, were taken towards the compound itself by Bly and his men, who were riding BARC speeders. Along the way, the group was harried by vulture droids, but they were in turn covered by Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighters.</p><p>The speeders did not last for long, and as they were destroyed by the pursuing fighters, the Jedi jumped into a nearby river. The river ran through to a waterfall, at the foot of which was a hidden entrance to the compound. Making their way cautiously through the corridors, Secura put Ekria to work at a nearby terminal. The young Padawan quickly discovered that Mai had in fact already departed Felucia, much to Secura's frustration. After Ekria let Bly and his troops into the facility, she was able to bring up a HoloNet News feed, which reported that the Confederacy had been driven away from Coruscant, due largely to the efforts of Generals <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\" href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\" slug=\"obi-wan-kenobi\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\" href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\" slug=\"darth-vader\">Anakin Skywalker</a>, whom Zonder greatly admired.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Zonder detected a strange smell, and Bly reported that there were toxins permeating the compound. Ekria's slicing had prompted a count-down sequence for the building's self-destruction, and Secura urged everyone to leave the compound posthaste. There was no door for them to escape through, but the hulking Zonder simply burst through one of the walls, allowing them to reach safety before the ensuing detonation. Many clone troopers died in the explosion, but more disturbing to Secura was the fact that their presence had triggered the release of poisonous biological agents into the planet's entire water supply. According to the group's calculations, within four days all water on the planet would be poisoned, resulting in a potentially massive loss of life.</p><p>Secura believed, however, that the crisis could be averted if they could capture several key water treatment facilities. She contacted Jedi Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\" href=\"/mace-windu/4005-5395/\" slug=\"mace-windu\">Mace Windu</a>, requesting more clones, and he agreed, sending Stass Allie to deliver them. Along with the reinforcements came Padawan <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58397\" href=\"/drake-logaan/4005-58397/\" slug=\"drake-logaan\">Drake Lo'gaan</a>, who was the apprentice of the late <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48070\" href=\"/roron-corobb/4005-48070/\" slug=\"roron-corobb\">Roron Corobb</a>. In the proposed strikes on the treatment plants, Secura sent Zonder, Ekria, and Lo'gaan to the city of Jiaozi, while she and Offee attacked separate locations. They were joined by the clone trooper Galle. While scouting the defenses, Ekria noted that there were sentients guarding Jiaozi's plant, preventing them from simply shooting everything. Zonder suggested biting some of them, but Lo'gaan came up with another idea.</p><p>Zonder bellowed, creating the loudest noise he possibly could, putting the defenders on the offensive. The Padawans then attacked, until Lo'gaan loudly gave Galle the order to retreat. As the clones ran away, the defending troops gave chase, leaving the facility largely unguarded. The few Gossam that did remain were easily intimidated by Zonder, who rounded them up, and had them direct the others to the control room. Ekria then quickly shut down the facility, preventing the toxin from spreading through it. The Selonian couldn't raise Offee or Secura while in the room, however, and so Ekria patched the cameras located in the clone troopers' helmets through the main viewscreen.</p><p>She then detected a priority signal coming through for Commander Bly from Coruscant, but she was not able to decrypt it, initially. Meanwhile, on the clone cameras, the Padawans, to their horror, were met with the sight of Secura being gunned down by her own men. The message was then decrypted, and it revealed that Bly had been given \"<a data-ref-id=\"4015-55868\" href=\"/order-66/4015-55868/\" slug=\"order-66\">Order 66</a>,\" a term that the Padawans were unfamiliar with. Shortly thereafter, they received a transmission from Supreme Chancellor <a data-ref-id=\"4005-16164\" href=\"/emperor-palpatine/4005-16164/\" slug=\"emperor-palpatine\">Palpatine</a>, urging them to return to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56425\" href=\"/jedi-temple/4020-56425/\" slug=\"jedi-temple\">Jedi Temple</a>, as the war was apparently over. Switching to Galle's camera, they found that he was closing in on their position, to Lo'gaan's great concern.</p><p>Zonder, Ekria, and Lo'gaan were able to evade Galle and made their way to Coruscant, now called \"Imperial Center.\" Palpatine had seized power and made himself Emperor, replacing the Republic with a Galactic Empire. In the wake of Order 66, the Jedi had all but been wiped from the face of the galaxy. Nevertheless, the trio managed to eke out an existence on Imperial Center—Zonder in particular was able to hunt in Imperial City's lower levels for food. Meanwhile, Ekria sliced into the Jedi Temple's archives, and erased the Padawans' existence from them. She believed that there were other Jedi who had survived, and that they would return to Imperial Center to liberate the people of the galaxy from Palpatine's Empire. Lo'gaan disagreed, but the group agreed that they would not make any public displays of using the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\" href=\"/the-force/4015-50253/\" slug=\"the-force\">Force</a>, lest they bring down the Imperial authorities upon themselves.</p><p>Lo'gaan decided to venture into the Uscru Entertinment Distrit to cheat, using the Force, at a game of divot, in order to obtain some credits. Zonder observed the game from nearby, in case of trouble. Sure enough, it came, when a Toydarian playing noticed that Lo'gaan was but a child, and he was apprehended by the Nalle triplets. When a disgruntled Jokhalli drew his blaster in an attempt to kill Lo'gaan, Zonder burst forth from his position, freeing his comrade. They departed the room, but were spotted by Imperial <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56620\" href=\"/stormtroopers/4060-56620/\" slug=\"stormtroopers\">stormtroopers</a>, forcing them to flee. As they neared the Outlandr Club, Lo'gaan believed they were safe, until they came across yet another set of stormtroopers. Ekria, however, arrived to liberate them, allowing them to escape. As they did so, however, Lo'gaan utilized the Force to knock back incoming stormtroopers, to Ekria's chagrin.</p><p>At her urging, Zonder and Lo'gaan set out to find legitimate jobs at Employment Center DA4176, which was meant for non-Humans only. Lo'gaan was approached by members of the Sub-Adult Group, who separated him from Zonder, as Lo'gaan was a Human. Alone, the Selonian found a job as a construction worker, helping rebuild Imperial Center following the prior Battle of Coruscant. However, he was to be shipped off-world in several days to the Emerald Splender Estates on Byss, where some benefactors of the Clone Wars were having a \"luxury housing emergency.\" He met up with Lo'gaan and Ekria after claiming his job—Lo'gaan had succeeded in entering the Sub-Adult Group. Ekria was unsure, however, as the Sub-Adult Group was a subdivision of the Commisson for the Preservaion of the New Order, which was dedicated to protecting the Empire against those who opposed it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ekria had located a new place of residence for the trio, an apartment that was considerably more upscale than their previous hideout. Shortly afterward, Zonder boarded the craft bound for Byss, and shared a room with a Gotal, an Ithorian, and a Gran. Before departing, however, Ekria burst into their room sporting makeshift armor, informing him that the ship was a slave ship. She insisted that they leave, but Zonder would not depart without the other non-Humans aboard the craft. Destroying the astromech droids that were serving drinks, the Selonian announced that he was a Jedi, and that everyone aboard was being unwittingly lured into slavery. His point got through to some of his fellow non-Humans, and they joined him and Ekria in leaving the ship.</p><p>Before they could make it off the craft, however, the group was confronted by three Inquisitors—Halmere, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75144\" href=\"/gwellib-ap-llewff/4005-75144/\" slug=\"gwellib-ap-llewff\">Gwellib Ap-Llewff</a>, and Lanu Pasiq—who each had their blasters drawn. Halmere specifically demanded that Zonder come with them, while Pasiq ordered the other non-Humans back to their cabins. The Selonian responded by biting Halmere's arm, while Pasiq opened fire on Ekria. The Padawan was able to deflect the blast, but the non-Humans were inspired. They attacked the Inquisitors and subdued them, before stormtroopers arrived and opened fire. The group found shelter within the ship and was joined by Lo'gaan. Zonder, however, noticed that the ship's engines were starting up, and Lo'gaan informed them that all the primary exits were guarded. Ekria, figuring out an exit strategy, led them to the ship's cargo bay. There, they found a Bantha-ll cargo skiff, allowing the group to escape. Lo'gaan, however, had other business to attend to, and he returned to the ship. He came back sometime later, and the trio were able to relax back at Ekria's new apartment.</p><p>Following the slave ship incident, Zonder, Lo'gaan, and Ekria became crime fighters in Coruscant's underground, and took on the code names of \"Paws,\" \"Spike,\" and \"Blue,\" respectively. One night, they witnessed the Nashtah Gang accost an Omwati couple, Kodo and Aleema Finn. The trio, donning makeshift costumes, fought off the gang, but Kodo was wounded by a departing adversary. Inspecting the wound, a flesh burn, Zonder had Ekria call for a medic, before the trio departed the scene. Later, while Zonder and Lo'gaan defended a local vendor from a pack of thugs, Ekria informed them over their comlinks that she had discovered that Kodo Finn had been branded with the symbol of crime syndicate Black Sun.</p><p>As Zonder urged the vendor to call the local authorities, Lo'gaan requested the Finns' location from Ekria, so they could warn them of Black Sun's involvement. She provided it, and so Lo'gaan and Zonder began traveling to 662 Gasgor Valley. Making their way up the side of the Finns' building, the two Jedi entered through the window and sat down with the Omwati couple, attempting to determine whether or not they knew if Black Sun had any cause to target them. At that moment, an explosion rocked the room, and the bounty hunter Boushhh entered. Lo'gaan ordered Zonder to take the Finns away and told him that he would meet up with them later.</p><p>Ekria rendezvoused with Zonder and the Finns, and Lo'gaan joined them later, having battled both Boushh and Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne at the apartment. Realizing that Black Sun wanted Kodo dead, Lo'gaan questioned the Finns, and discovered that he had been tinkering with Xizor Transport Company docking assignments for the Tagge Company. The Xizor Transport Company was owned by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51359\" href=\"/prince-xizor/4005-51359/\" slug=\"prince-xizor\">Prince Xizor</a>, an ambitious Black Sun captain. The Finns decided that they wanted to leave Imperial Center and forge a new life, but Lo'gaan would hear none of it, insisting that they confront Xizor directly. Zonder joined him, and took the Finns along to the Xizor Transport Company headquarters, with Ekria in tow.</p><p>Making their way through the facility, the group battled droidekas and Xizor's bodyguards, before entering the prince's office. There, Xizor himself was waiting for them, initially believing that the Jedi had brought the Finns in to collect the bounty on their heads. Instead, Ekria claimed that the Finns would provide the prince with information of the Tagge docking plans, in exchange for immunity in departing Imperial Center. Another condition was that they would never return to the galactic capital, or Xizor would be free to have them killed. The group were then free to leave, although the prince had placed tracking devices on the Jedi. They discovered the ruse, however, and placed the devices on a trio of rodents. Ekria supposed that they would not be able to live in peace until they faced down Inquisitor Tremayne, but Lo'gaan disagreed, believing that their quest would not be over until they confronted Tremayne's master, the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader.</p><p>Eventually, Zonder was somehow captured by Xizor's agents. Rendered unconscious, the prince transferred custody over him to Inquisitor Tremayne, who began torturing him. The Inquisitor tried to convince the Selonian that his friends were not coming to rescue him, but Zonder, demonstrating his ability with the Force, picked up the nearby Inquisitor Pasiq with telekinesis, and claimed that he was not desperate, merely hungry. At that moment, Lord Vader himself entered the room, having been disturbed by Zonder's earlier screams. The Dark Lord inspected the Selonian's lightsaber and personal communicator, the latter of which he activated, to Tremayne's surprise. With the images from the torture chamber now being transmitted to Lo'gaan and Ekria, Vader had Zonder released from the torture apparatus and gave him his lightsaber.</p><p>Zonder did not fear Vader, but he realized that he would not survive the forthcoming duel with the Dark Lord, due to his sub-par skills with the lightsaber. The two clashed blades, but as Zonder leapt to dodge the Dark Lord's attacks, Vader threw his saber, striking the Selonian in the shoulder. Moving in to attack, Zonder was quickly out-fenced by Vader, who struck him across the midsection, before decapitating the Selonian. Zonder's body was later recovered by Ekria and Lo'gaan, who buried him on Selonia, after they faked their own deaths on Tepasi.</p>",

    "deck": "The Tracker was the son of international criminal Athena and mobster Lorenzo Rossetti, Nico became part of his mother's Network In Gotham City, he assumed the identity of the Tracker, a vigilante pursuing the Rossetti family's interests. He wore a demonic-looking costume and was assisted by Doctor Excess' performance-enhancing drugs.",
    "description": "<p>Nicholas Kazantkakis aka the Tracker attacked the Rossetti mob as a demonstration of his mother’s hatred for Caesar Rossetti. Gabriel Rossetti, Caesar's grandson, has taken over his grandfather's operations by expanding into drug trafficking. Tracker killed the mobsters by emitting an electrical charge into their bodies. Fortunately, Batman saved Santos, one of Rossetti's men named. As a means of gratitude, Santos agreed to be Batman's eyes and ears in order find out who would have a personal vendetta against the Rossetti mob. Nicholas returns to the Zephyr Building in Midtown Gotham. The Zephyr Building is actually a secret hideout for the Court of Owls. Nicholas tells Doctor Excess, the Court's physician, about his opinion of the Batman. Nicholas believes Batman fights crime because he finds danger exhilarating but the doctor tells Nicholas not to underestimate the seductive allure of risking one's life. The doctor believes that the Batman's crusade on crime in Gotham stems from a deep-rooted psychological trauma during his childhood and he possesses an obsessive compulsion to save lives even though some don't want to be saved. After their discussion,the doctor injects a synthesized compound composed of electrum into Nick's body thus making him somewhat invulnerable to being injured or killed.</p> <p>The next day, Bruce attends another meeting at Wayne Enterprises because the board is deciding whether or not to keep Bruce as CEO of Wayne Enterprises. Celia Kazantkakis tries to convince the board that Wayne Enterprises would be nothing without a Wayne at the helm. Delilah Wagner who is the proponent of Bruce's removal believes his social life as a boy billionaire could pose as a disastrous liability for the company's reputation. Even though Bruce was cleared for his involvement with Vesper Fairchild's murder, he was still being scrutinized by the press. Delilah believes that Bruce's peculiar notoriety makes the stockholders and business partners uncomfortable. Delilah gives Bruce a written ultimatum which dictates that if he refuses to resign from the company then she will put in a vote of no-confidence in front of the shareholders. Celia convinces Bruce to consider Delilah’s request as a formality. The board knows Bruce has let Lucius Fox handle the day-to-day responsibilities of the company but Lucius's condition after his near fatal stroke has left him unable to carry on. </p> <p>Bruce had feared that Wayne Enterprises would be vulnerable of a takeover but not from inside his own company. Lex Luthor was counting on this vulnerability when he hired David Cain to implicate Bruce as Vesper's murderer. Bruce hired Delilah to keep other corporate sharks at bay but eventually he knew that Delilah would pull a stunt like this. However, Bruce was more concerned about the Tracker's motives for attacking the Rosettis. Bruce has been studying the Tracker's movements for the last two months. The Tracker apprehended Rossetti's family accountant Bertis Delgado. The Tracker also killed Clement Wellman by feeding him to his dogs in Little Moscow. According to the testimonies of those who survived the Tracker's bust at a crystal meth lab, they described Tracker as something demonic.</p> <p>On the other side of the city, Gabriel Rossetti makes his way to his car but his driver Ruiz is nowhere to be found. Suddenly, Ruiz is dropped on the windshield of Rossetti's car. Rossetti and his men open fire on the Tracker. The Tracker knocks out Rossetti and his crew then he makes his escape with Rossetti's brief case. Fortunately, Batman has been observing Rossetti's movements in the likely event that the Tracker would show up. Doctor Excess uses the surveillance feed throughout Gotham to keep in contact with Tracker by via comm link. The Court managed to acquire the service of two techno savvy criminals named the Technician and Bugg which allowed the Court to have eyes and ears throughout Gotham. Doctor Excess tells Nicholas not to engage the Batman. The Tracker takes the doctor's advice and makes a quick getaway by discharging an electrical pulse at Batman.</p> <p>Rossetti decides to seek outside help in order to combat the Tracker. Penguin recommends the Technician who has a fetish for collecting several things that predate Gotham's beginnings. Things that range from the World Fair in 1941 and the Technician refurbishes them. However, the Technician refuses Rossetti's offer to take down the Tracker and instead gives Rossetti a business card in the form of a playing card. The Technician recommends that Rossetti contract the Suicide King.</p> <p>During Dumont Hotel benefit gala at Wayne Enterprises, Delilah threatens the mayor that Wayne Enterprises will take their business elsewhere unless the city can provide a greater incentive. Bruce arrives at the gala but he is accosted by a drunk named Roger Sloane. Sloane tells Bruce that he must speak with him but the gala security removes Sloane before he could utter another word. Celia pulls Bruce away from his date at the gala in order to speak with him. Celia confides in Bruce to fight for control of Wayne Enterprises because she feels Bruce's mother would be disappointed in him if he didn't. She continues by bringing up her past and how she met Bruce's mother.  </p><p>Forty years ago, Celia was the guardian at the Copper Street orphanage. Celia's mother ran the orphanage until she passed away and Celia continued on afterwards. Celia met Martha Wayne when Celia was being harassed by a developer named Stanford Whitaker. Whitaker wanted to buyout the entire neighborhood which included the orphanage so he could build high-rise apartments. Martha has been combating Whitaker at City Hall and she finally beat him by getting City Hall's approval to make the entire neighborhood an historical landmark. Celia was grateful for Martha's efforts and Martha took Celia out to celebrate at a local club called Chat Noir on Avenue B. It was here that Martha met Denholm Sinclair who was an affiliate of Caesar Rossetti. Celia tried to warn Martha but Martha wouldn't listen so Celia took it upon herself to confront Sinclair and tell him to leave Martha alone. Sinclair viewed Celia’s defensiveness as a charming form of envy. Sinclair agrees to leave Martha alone and decides to woo Celia with his masculine charm.  </p><p>Sadly, the victory of saving the neighborhood was short-lived because the orphanage was burnt down to the ground. The evidence against Whitaker was circumstantial but he was eventually convicted for arson by the jury thanks to Martha Wayne’s testimony as well as Celia’s. Unbeknownst to Bruce, Celia had held back on what truly happened at the orphanage. Martha eventually found out that Celia had burnt down the orphanage in order to collect the insurance money and Whitaker was the perfect patsy. Martha confronted Celia about the orphanage but Celia didn't acknowledge Martha’s accusations. Instead, Celia wrote off Martha's anger as petty jealousy because Sinclair courted Celia rather than Martha. However, Celia knew Martha's political pull in Gotham so she decided to leave the country by returning to her ancestral home in Greece. Celia plays off of Bruce's emotions by she regrets not being a part of Bruce's life after martha was killed. </p> <p>Meanwhile. the Suicide King pays the Rossetti house a visit. The Suicide King shows off his talents by taking out some of Rosetti's men. Suicide King then introduces himself to Gabriel Rossetti who is impressed by the king's ingenuity. Gabriel deems Suicide King worthy enough to be a part of his organization. The Suicide King tells Gabriel that he can eliminate the Tracker if Gabriel signs over 20% of the Rossetti's family business to him. Gabriel reluctantly agrees Suicide King’s offer because he wants the Tracker dealt with sooner rather than later.  </p><p>Bruce goes Lucius Fox to get his impression on Celia. Lucius informs Bruce that Celia made her fortune in textiles throughout Europe but now her main source of income is real estate. She later married Porter Endicott, a Spanish national and took over his corporate position of power when he passed away. Lucius views Celia as a tough business woman but a humble person nonetheless. Batman later meets with Santos to gather more Intel on who the Tracker is and why he has a vendetta against the Rossettis. Santos informs Batman that Gabriel Rossetti has hired the Suicide King to take out the Tracker. Both Gabriel and the Suicide King have set up a bogus money drop in order to lure the Tracker out into the open.  </p><p>As Batman makes his way to money drop, he contacts Oracle. Bruce asks Oracle to find out who the Tracker's point man is because he recalls the Tracker was speaking to someone through a comm link. Oracle uses her decryption software to decipher any irregular transmissions that could be linked to the Tracker and Doctor Excess thereby giving her a digital trail to follow. Oracle also brought up some interesting information on Delilah Wagner's business methods. Oracle gave this damaging information to the stock exchange commission which will indict Delilah for fraud and insider trading.  </p><p> Batman also contacts Tim Drake and instructs him to investigate Roger Sloane. Batman wants to find out why Sloane was so anxious to speak to Bruce Wayne. Tim discovers that Sloan has outdated press credentials and he was once an award-winning Boston reporter until his editor learned that he was fabricating his sources. It turns out Sloane has been obsessed with the recent events that have been occurring at Wayne Enterprises. Sloane has documented a pattern that could possibly be a conspiracy. His conspiracy starts with Bruce's decision to leave the country then Wagner's ascension at Wayne Enterprises and finally the untimely death of Porter Endicott. Tim believes Sloane was trying to make up for the slander and libel that he printed at his bugle and he wanted to rejoin the media's good grace by reporting a fantastical new story. Unfortunately, Mister Fun, one of Celia's associates, disposed of Sloane before Tim got to his apartment. Mister Fun removed any incriminating evidence that could be linked back to Celia and dumped Sloane's body in a nearby dumpster.  </p><p>Batman arrives at the money drop as does the Tracker. Both the Tracker and Batman watch as Gabriel Rossetti gives a brief case full of money to Arturo Zamora. Batman informs the Tracker that he is being set up and the Tracker says \"It's the other way around.\" Tracker shocks Batman with his tazer talons then the Suicide King makes his entrance. Suicide King pretends to fight off the Tracker in order to gain Gabriel's trust. Suicide King stuns the Tracker and the Tracker falls twenty stories off a rooftop. Batman attacks Suicide King for what he did to the Tracker. Batman deduces that the Suicide King's fighting style is Asano Nitobe. Batman almost defeats Suicide King until the Tracker returns and knocks out Batman. Suicide King is amazed that the Tracker actually survived his fall.  </p><p>Suicide King tells the Tracker to abort their mission in killing the Batman. Batman overheard their conversation as he staggered to his feet. Batman finally realizes that the Tracker and the Suicide King are running a shakedown operation by gaining Rossetti's trust thereby allowing them to infiltrate his organization. Doctor Excess tells the Tracker to retreat back to their base of operations but the Tracker refuses. Batman activates a signal jammer to cut off Doctor Excess' communication with the Tracker. During their heated confrontation, the Tracker and Batman collide with a stack of metal pipes and steel beams. Both the Tracker and Batman must jump off the rooftop to avoid the plummeting mass of metal. Batman manages to save himself with his grappling claw but he was unable to grab Nicholas in time. Batman descends to the bottom and finds the Tracker buried in a heap of metal beams. As Batman pushed the beams away, he could see that the steel pipes had impaled the Tracker. Batman removes the Tracker's mask and is shocked that the Tracker is Nicholas, Celia's son.</p> <p>The next day, Delilah Wagner is taken into custody for her crimes and Bruce informs Celia that she is the new CEO of Wayne Enterprises. Celia had anticipated on Bruce’s affections toward her and his reasoning for making her Delilah’s replacement because she knew her manipulations on Bruce's emotions would work. Her victory of becoming the new CEO of Wayne Enterprises was short-lived when she heard that her son had died. Mister Fun removed Nicholas’ body from the County Morgue because Celia knew that if the coroners examined Nicholas’ body then they would have found Doctor Excess' electrum compound in Nicholas' bloodstream.  </p><p> Unfortunately, Freeway, Celia's right hand man, was unable to procure the Tracker's stealth suit from the hazmat team who arrived at the crime scene. It turns out that the hazmat team wanted to analyze the Tracker's suit because it's parts of a new procedure that began after Vox’s armor destroyed half of a building in Gotham last year. It was Celia's last wish to have her son cremated thereby destroying any evidence of Doctor Excess' electrum compound. It would seem that Nicholas was the first step in perfecting Doctor Excess's electrum compound because the Court of Owls wanted to utilize this compound and make more Talon enforcers. The Talons would be near unstoppable but they would also be replaceable.  </p><b>Court of Owls</b> <br /><p>Celia is still a member of the Court of the Owls. She was present when Talon who was later revealed as Dick Grayson's great grandfather, was beaten by the Batman. Celia is no longer able to walk but she is escorted in wheelchair by an unknown Court member.   </p>",

    "deck": "Robert Bruce Banner Jr. is the son of The Incredible Hulk, the adopted stepson of The Hooded Man and is Second-in-Command of The New Defenders.",
    "description": "<p>.Hulk Jr. is the son of the</p><p><a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Incredible Hulk</a></p><p>from an alternate reality. He was raised as his own by the <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Hooded Man</a> (Wolverine from the Old Man Logan storyline).</p><p>Hulk Jr. is a brilliant scientist like his father and the protege of <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a>. But things were bleak in this reality, Earth was dying and so were it's people. Under the command of the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a>, Hulk Jr. was able to construct a time machine to send himself and the <a href=\"/new-defenders/4060-55735/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55735\">New Defenders</a> back in time in order to create a better time machine with resources from the past. Then with that energy they could take the remaining six billion suffering people of their planet back to the past as well.</p><p>Before they could go back, <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> came to Earth. Hulk Jr. and the New Defenders attacked and subdued Galactus, though with great loss of life, and brought Galactus back to the past with them to power their time machine.</p><p>Once in the past, Hulk Jr. set up his machine and the New Defenders captured the <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> to help power the machine. The <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> intervened and reprogrammed the device, sending all the refugees to an artificial planet known as <a href=\"/nu-world/4020-55680/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55680\">Nu-World</a>. Hulk Jr. and the New Defenders went with them to be the super heroes of that world.</p><p>Right after the team changed their name to the <a href=\"/fantastic-force/4060-18869/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-18869\">Fantastic Force</a>, they were attacked by what Hulk Jr. believed to be his mother. He left with her and found out that she was <a href=\"/betty-ross/4005-3445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3445\">his mother</a> (only what he didn't know was that she was driven insane by becoming the Harpy and was from an alternate timeline). She was able to imprint on him and make him turn against his teammates.</p><p>Wolverine would not fight his son, so <a href=\"/natalie-x/4005-57713/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57713\">Natalie X</a> turned on his berserker rage. They kept each other occupied until <a href=\"/psionics/4005-57712/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57712\">Psionics</a> used them to knock each other out. When Hulk Jr. awoke, the team was in battle with the remaining <a href=\"/hysteries/4060-57935/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57935\">Hysteries</a>, a team created by an insane <a href=\"/gaea/4005-15778/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15778\">Gaea</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> then siphoned the gamma radiation from Hulk Jr. to minimalize the threat he posed. Without his Hulk form, which he was brilliant in, he was far superior mentally. It would seem the gamma was making him dumber than he really was.</p><p>With his new found intellect, Rob was able to make a device to transport the Hysteries back to their proper timelines. He then used one of Reed Richards' time devices to go back to their dying Earth (with Wolverine, who Gaea had reduced to a walking skeleton). Back on their original world, Gaea gave Rob his gamma powers back, thus reducing his intelligence. In order to save both worlds, Wolverine stayed behind to help Gaea get her sanity back. He and Rob said their goodbyes and Gaea sent Hulk Jr. back to Nu-World.</p><p>Things went wrong though and the sun of Nu-World collapsed into a black hole. This caused time to accelerate and the people to revolt and wage war.</p><p><a href=\"/lightwave/4005-57714/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57714\">Lightwave</a> and <a href=\"/alex-ultron/4005-57812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57812\">Alex Ultron</a> took control of the world and used <a href=\"/natalie-x/4005-57713/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57713\">Natalie X</a> to control as many of the populace as they could. Although not fully explained, it would seem Hulk Jr. have moral objections to this and he was taken prisoner.</p><p>When the <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> and the <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> came to Nu-World for a visit, Thing was captured as well. Hulk Jr. was rescued with the Thing where he punched and killed Lightwave's daughter <a href=\"/psionics/4005-57712/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57712\">Psionics</a>, who was attacking them. Hulk Jr. remained behind saying he had unfinished business with Lightwave.</p><p>Hulk Jr. would eventually become the <a href=\"/maestro/4005-7865/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7865\">Maestro</a>.</p>",

As the years passed, the people of Feron began to rely on their Lantern's service as an indispensable part of their society. The Green Lantern was constantly informed of danger through a system of alarms designed to alert the protector whenever disaster struck.</span></span></span></p> <p><span style=\"COLOR: windowtext\"><span><span>Yet, despite his presence, the Green Lantern could not stop war from raging across the globe. After many had died, the Green Lantern further strengthened his role as his planet's premier protector by dictating terms of peace to the warring armies. For decades after, the Green Lantern was relied on by the people of Feron for his judgment and guidance. </span></span></span></p> <p><span style=\"COLOR: windowtext\"><span><span>When the time came for the Lantern to retire from the Corps, Feron was buzzing with speculation as to their champion’s successor. The people had come to rely on and expect the services of a Green Lantern and all were anxious to find out the identity of their next emerald warrior. </span></span></span></p> <p><span style=\"COLOR: windowtext\"><span><span>However, before he retired, the elderly Green Lantern of Feron made a surprising request of the masters he had long and faithfully served. The Lantern asked the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-universe\">Guardians of the Universe</a> to issue an order making Feron off limits to the next protector of his space sector. The Guardians understood that their veteran deeply regretted how dependant and helpless his people had become, having relied on his power to solve their world's problems for so very long. Although they felt this measure was drastic, the Guardians honored the Lantern's request and made Feron off limits to that sector's next protector.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"> </span></span></span></span></p> <p><span style=\"COLOR: windowtext\"><span><span>The people of Feron were stunned by this decision. Fear soon took hold as the people rioted in the streets. The Green Lantern of Feron simply flew home to his wife, Miranda, looking back with hope that someday the people of Feron would regain the self reliance he had helped them to lose. </span></span></span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span><span>It is unknown whether or not the Green Lantern of Feron had reenlisted following the reformation of the Corps or if he has chosen to remain retired. To date, the fate of Feron has not been reported but, for reasons unexplained, he is currently presumed deceased.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>**Gion's story is very similiar to that of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49714\" href=\"/wissen/4005-49714/\" slug=\"wissen\">Wissen</a>.  One can only wonder if the two Lanterns knew each other, protected neighboring sectors, or simply lived by similiar morals and ethics**</i></span></span></p>",

That all changes when she is given the Omnicle, a machine made by Alexander Graham Bell that not only lets her see and hear, but gives her super-human strength and agility that she uses to protect President McKinley.<br/><br/>However, the Omnicle was later destroyed. Dr. Bell tried to repair it, but so far it just doesn't work anymore. Helen went back to College. Exams. Studying. The same quiet life she used to have.<br/></p><h3><br/></h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \"><strong>Powers</strong></span><br/>Invented by Alexander Graham Bell, the remarkable power the Omnicle has granted Helen is merely a side benefit. Using light and sound, this device forms new pathways through Helen's damaged brain, allowing her to see and hear as we do. These re-routes may pass through some unknown primeval region in the mind, which may account for Helen's Herculean Strength and agility when the Omnicle is activated.<br/><br/>The Omnicle also grants Helen \"Soul Sight,\" in which she sees a dark aura around those with a mind to commit malace. Those who are pure of spirit appear bathed in a heavenly glow.<br/><br/>The Omnicle was originally intended to cure blindness and deafness for all, not just Helen. Dr. Bell has been unable to replicate the effect on any other deaf and blind patients. It seems Helen is unique.<strong><br/></strong>",

    "description": "<p>As the war between the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57545\" href=\"/super-skrulls/4060-57545/\" slug=\"super-skrulls\">Super-Skrulls</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\" href=\"/asgardian-gods/4060-41205/\" slug=\"asgardian-gods\">The Asgardians</a> raged, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6139\" href=\"/beta-ray-bill/4005-6139/\" slug=\"beta-ray-bill\">Beta Ray Bill</a> boastfully shouted towards the Skrull Vessel asking if these warriors were the best ones The Skrulls had to offer. Their response to his overconfidence was a Super-Skrull unlike any other that had come before her. Indeed The Godkiller was unique, she had undergone extensive gene-altering surgical proceedures to not only gain the combined powers of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7235\" href=\"/thundra/4005-7235/\" slug=\"thundra\">Thundra</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4943\" href=\"/titania/4005-4943/\" slug=\"titania\">Titania</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14536\" href=\"/volcana/4005-14536/\" slug=\"volcana\">Volcana</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28854\" href=\"/battleaxe/4005-28854/\" slug=\"battleaxe\">Battleaxe</a> but also have the ability to wield Bill's stolen Hammer, <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40972\" href=\"/stormbreaker/4055-40972/\" slug=\"stormbreaker\">Stormbreaker</a>, which The Skrulls had, through a combination of science and sorcerery, split apart and reforged into twin Axes.<br/><br/>Having seen what The Skrulls did to his Hammer, Beta Ray Bill challenged The Godkiller to a duel, but in moments both Bill and many other Asgardians learned who the superior combatant was. As The Godkiller beat Beta Ray Bill, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7201\" href=\"/balder/4005-7201/\" slug=\"balder\">Balder</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-33600\" href=\"/warriors-three/4060-33600/\" slug=\"warriors-three\">The Warriors Three</a> simultaneously and single-handedly without even so much as breaking a sweat, a newborn Human baby named Faith was born in nearby Broxton. The Godkiller was able to \"smell\" the newborn's birth in the midst of war and immediately focused all her thoughts on reaching Broxton and ripping the Humans to shreds. Tossing Beta Ray Bill aside The Godkiller began making her way off of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\" href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" slug=\"asgard-marvel\">Asgard</a> while Bill, Balder and The Warriors Three gave chase.<br/><br/>But upon reaching the spot where Bill dropped <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\" href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" slug=\"mjolnir\">Mjolnir</a>; The Godkiller was confronted by Donald Blake. Knowing full-well what he would turn into if she allowed Blake to grab Mjolnir she began planning her next attack only to find herself thrown off-balance by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3513\" href=\"/volstagg/4005-3513/\" slug=\"volstagg\">Volstagg</a> who gave Donald the distraction and time needed to transform into his alter-ego: The Mighty <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" slug=\"thor\">Thor</a>. Infuriated by Volstagg's interferance The Godkiller began beating Volstagg to death with the Stormbreaker Axes but as she did so she forgot that Thor had entered the playing field and was promptly smacked in the face with Mjolnir. The conflict raged once more and as it did <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3512\" href=\"/fandral/4005-3512/\" slug=\"fandral\">Fandral</a> drove his sword into The Godkiller's chest which Thor hammered down even further in causing The Godkiller great pain.<br/><br/>Nevertheless she took the pain in strides, laughed and put Stormbreaker back together. She spun it around, made the hammer overload and flung it into the Heavens where if it hit Broxton; Stormbreaker would explode like an atomic bomb, killing everyone who lived there. Thor was able to keep Stormbreaker from doing so however and returned it to Bill. Together Thor and Bill tricked The Godkiller into going directly under Asgard which they then dropped on top of her. When Thor and Bill rose Asgard back into the air all that was left of The Godkiller was green slime. The threat to Broxton and Asgard was over and no one would ever hear from The Godkiller ever again.</p>",
