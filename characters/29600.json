He was able to create what he called the Perfect Strategy Mind, which was a mental state that allowed him to consider a vast number of factors and devise the perfect solution.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Leaving K'un-Lun, he involved himself in the events that would be known as the Second Opium War, siding with the Chinese against the British and French armies. He used his Perfect Strategy Mind to come up with a plan for the battle at the Taku Forts in 1860. He believed it was flawless, but he also believed it would be his final battle. He was prepared for that as it would be the perfect death. However, things did not happen as he planned. His forces were all killed, and he was captured alive.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bei Bang-Wen was created by Ed Brubaker and Matt Fraction and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-immortal-iron-fist-3-the-last-iron-fist-story-/4000-106628/\">The Immortal Iron Fist issue 3 </a>(2007).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Prisinor</h3><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5756/405822-124306-bei-bang-wen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-405822\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5756/405822-124306-bei-bang-wen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-405822\"><img alt=\"Leading the charge\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5756/405822-124306-bei-bang-wen.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5756/405822-124306-bei-bang-wen.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Leading the charge</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bei Bang-Wen was taken to a prison in India where he was brutalized and forced to work as slave labor. He protested none of this, feeling he deserved all of it and worse for his failure at the Taku Forts. Even if he wanted to fight back, he felt cut off from the chi of Shou-Lao. He had no power. In prison, he met another man with a very similiar story. Vivatma Visvajit was also a warrior whose power came from a mystical source, from the god Shiva, and he too felt cut off. He failed to protect his emperor and was sent here much like Bei Bang-Wen failed and came to this place. Together, they resolved to orchestrate a massive prison break and go help Vivatma's exiled emperor. It not only gave Bei a purpose but the means to find his perfect death again.</p><h3>Burma</h3><figure style=\"width: 383px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5756/405825-21109-bei-bang-wen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-405825\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.11227154047\" data-width=\"383\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5756/405825-21109-bei-bang-wen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-405825\"><img alt=\"Crippled by shame\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5756/405825-21109-bei-bang-wen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5756/405825-21109-bei-bang-wen.jpg 383w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5756/405825-21109-bei-bang-wen.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Crippled by shame\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5756/405825-21109-bei-bang-wen.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5756/405825-21109-bei-bang-wen.jpg 383w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5756/405825-21109-bei-bang-wen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Crippled by shame</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The two warriros traveled to Burma and found the place the exiled emperor was supposed to be imprisoned. This was not the case. The entire story was a trap to lure the two holy warriors to this place, set by a woman creature called Tiger Jani. She wanted to consume their special life-forces. Realizing his emperor was dead, something released in Vivatma's mind. It was a feeling of closure that let him get over his feelings of shame for failing his emperor. WIth that, his power unlocked. Bei joined in the fight, but received a mortal wound from Tiger Jani. Vivatma finished her off and used his power in combination with Shou-Lao's chi inside of Bei to heal him. Bei had also let go of his guilt and shame of failing and found his power reawakened.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Before leaving Vivatma, Bei used his Perfect Strategy Mind to devise a way Vivatma could help his people by becoming the new emperor and giving the people something to hope for. Bei then left, journeying all the way back to K'un-Lun. He relinguished his role as the Iron Fist and returned the chi of Shou-Lao to its source so the Iron Fist cycle could begin anew. He then went on to live a full, academic life in the mystical city, marrying and having thirteen sons. But his legend and the book of the Iron Fist says that Iron Fist Bei Bang-Wen died in the mud of the Taku Forts and lived from 1827 to 1860.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>In Other Media</h2><figure style=\"width: 223px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364473-images.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1364473\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0134529147982\" data-width=\"223\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364473-images.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1364473\"><img alt=\" Bei Bang-Wen in MUA2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px\" data-width=\"223\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364473-images.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364473-images.jpg 223w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Bei Bang-Wen in MUA2\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364473-images.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62398/1364473-images.jpg 223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px\" data-width=\"223\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Bei Bang-Wen in MUA2</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bei Bang-Wen is an unlockable costume for Iron Fist in the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions of <i>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.</i></p>",

Even her Hollow mask was a damaged, cartoonish skull. She has large incisors and a horizontal crimson-line that runs across her face, under her eyes. She also has a large scar between her eyes. Unlike any other Hollow that has been introduced in the story, her personality was very innocent. She was afraid of Ichigo, believing that Shinigami were evil. She has a childish style of speech and talks with a lisp. Eventually, she begins to bond with Ichigo after she forces him to play several games of tag and rides on his back as he heads for the Hueco Mundo castle of Las Noches.</p><h2>Major Story Arc</h2><h3>Hueco Mundo Arc</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3080315\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3080315-m7_bleach_ch291_09.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.7495183044316\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3080315-m7_bleach_ch291_09.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3080315\"><img alt=\"Nel transforms to save Ichigo\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3080315-m7_bleach_ch291_09.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3080315-m7_bleach_ch291_09.png 519w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/3080315-m7_bleach_ch291_09.png 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3080315-m7_bleach_ch291_09.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Nel transforms to save Ichigo</figcaption></figure><p>Nel Tu had was running about the deserts of Hueco Mundo playing when she met Ichigo Kurosaki and his friends. She led them to Las Noches, since they were there to save their friend Orihime Inoue. The group had to separate as they got deeper inside, and Nel tagged along with Ichigo. She watched as Ichigo fought with Dordonii Alessandro Del Socacchio, and saved him using her Double Cero. Dordonii turned his wrath on Nel, but Ichigo defeated him using Hollowfication. On Ichigo's request, she healed Dordonii's wounds with her healing saliva.</p><p>After <a href=\"/ulquiorra-cifer/4005-51716/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51716\">Ulquiorra Cifer</a> defeated Ichigo, Nel was crying over Ichigo's dead body when <a href=\"/grimmjow-jaegerjaquez/4005-51667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51667\">Grimmjow</a> arrived with Orihime to heal Ichigo. Nel blamed herself, becasue he had spent so much of the fight protecting her. As Grimmjow and Ichigo proceeded to fight, Nel scolded Orihime for being scared of Ichigo's Hollowfied form instead of cheering for him. Almost immediately after Ichigo's victory, they were attacked by Nnoitra Jiruga and his Fraccion, Tesla Lindocruz. Nnoitra revleaed her identiy of being the former 3rd ranked Espada, but she had no memories of it.</p><p>Just as Ichigo was about to be slain by Nnoitra, Nel suddenly returned to her humanoid form to rescue him.Her speed was still far too great, and Nnoitra forgot about her Double Cero. Nel was poised to with this fight with ease after she released her zanpakutō, but she suddenly transformed back into a child before giving the final blow. Nnoitra kicked Nel about as he taunted her and forced her to watch as she brutalized Ichigo. They were rescued by the appearance of <a href=\"/kenpachi-zaraki/4005-42566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42566\">Kenpachi Zaraki</a>, and Orihime healed her wounds.

Nel, still in her child form, rushed to the Human World to find Ichigo because Hueco Mundo had been overrun by a powerful army of Quincy called <a href=\"/vandenreich/4060-59345/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59345\">Vandenreich</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>As a former high ranking member of the Espada, Nel has an immense Spiritual Pressure (reaitsu) and strength. With a single hand she can stop and opponents Cero attack with ease. Some of her strengths do vary depending on which form she is currently in. Her adult form being the obviously stronger one. Still, some of her adult abilities do remain in the child form and it also has a few unique ones, as well. As with most character in the <i>BLEACH</i> series, Nel also possesses extraordinary skill with her own zanpakuto.</p><h3>Neliel's Child Form Techniques</h3><ul><li><b>Healing Saliva</b>: A trait that seems unique to her child form is a healing drool. With it, she can heal some injuries. She vomits it out by reaching into her throat and massaging her uvula.</li><li><b>Sonido</b> <strong>(響転/ソニード, <em>Sonīdo</em>): </strong>Nel can use a simplified version of the Hollow skill called Sonido, but she calls Super Acceleration (超加速, chōka soku). This allows for increased speed to avoid attacks. This is a technique she also has an adult, but at far less speed and skill.</li><li><b>Cero Double </b><strong>(重奏虚閃/セロ・ドーブル, <em>Sero Dōburu</em>):</strong> The Double Cero is a technique that Nel retains from her adult form. She can swallow an enemies energy based attack, increases the power by adding some of her own, and firing it back at the attacker. The consequence of this attack is that she becomes exhausted right after using it.</li></ul><h3>Neliel's Adult Form Techniques</h3><ul><li><b>Sonído</b><b>:</b> The Sinido that Nel can use is a speed technique that is similar to the Shimigami's Flash Step (瞬歩, <i>shunpo</i>). This allows the Hollow to move at extremely fast speeds that makes them seem to disappear form sight and flank enemies from behind. Nel's proficiency with this technique is such that she was able to carry Ichigo and appear to lose no speed.</li><li><b>Cero Double:</b> Using the Double Cero, she can swallow an enemies energy based attack, increases the power by adding some of her own, and firing it back at the attacker. Unlike her child form, this attack has no negative side effects and is even more powerful.</li><li><b>Hierro</b><strong> (鋼皮/イエロ, <i>Eero</i>):</strong> The Hierro is a technique that is unique to the Espada. The user condenses their Reiyoku<i>(Spirit Power)</i> to cause their skin to become as hard as steel armor and can block an attack from a zanpakuto. It's a powerful skill that allows for hand-to-hand combat with an armed opponent. The limit of the Hierro is dependent on the users Reiyoku. Nel's is strong enough to where she could kick away Nnoitra's own zanpakuto with no injury to herself.</li></ul><h2>Weapons &amp; Equipment</h2><h3>Zanpakutō</h3><p>Neliel's <a href=\"/zanpakuto/4055-42856/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42856\">zanpakutō</a> is named Gamuza (羚騎士/ガミューサ, gamyuusa). It has a green sheath and the tsuba is in the form of two crescent moons. The blade is in the shape of a basic katana. Similar to the Shinigami's <a href=\"/bankai/4015-50695/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50695\">Bankai</a>, the Espada and other Arrancar have what is called a Resurrección (帰刃 (レスレクシオン). They are released by a verbal command of the Arrancar. Neliel's command is Declare (謳え, <i>utae</i>) The extent of Gamuza's abilities have yet to be revealed. She has not used the Gamuza in an extended battle outside of releasing it to fight with Nnoitra. The released form of a Arrancar's zanpakuto reveals partially what their original Hollow form was before they were transformed into an Arrancar. Neliel's release transforms her into a centaur, and she has shoulder armor.</p><h4>Resurrección</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3079844\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.96112115732369\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3079844\"><img alt=\"Nel Tu's Resurrección form \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg 1106w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nel Tu's Resurrección form \" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg 1106w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47703/3079844-bleach_276_ms.bleach_296_pg04_05.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nel Tu's Resurrección form </figcaption></figure><p>Neliel's release command is \"Declare...

Stark ironically comes off as somewhat lazy. He spends most his time asleep or being assaulted by his only Fraccion <a href=\"../../lilinette/29-58654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Lilinette</a>. He was supposedly friends with the 9th Espada <a href=\"../../aaroniero-arruruerie/29-56442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Aaroniero</a> but gave little reaction to his comrade's reported demise. He can be compared to Soul Society's <a href=\"../../shunsui/29-54541/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Shunsui</a>  who shares Starrk's mannerisms towards fighting as a last resort. He  keeps his number hidden underneath the glove on his left hand.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><h2>Appearance</h2> <br />Starrk is a tall male with blue-grey eyes and shoulder-length brown hair. The remains of his hollow mask appear as a fanged bottom jaw positioned around his neck. His hollow hole is located on his sternum, right beneath the jawbone around his neck. His Espada number is tattooed on the back of his left hand, which he conceals with his glove. He wears a white Espada uniform with a black sash around his waist, similar to a matador. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><h2>Personality</h2> <br />Starrk is very unenthusiastic and aloof. He is lazy and is often found sleeping. He is the Primera Espada, but he shows reluctance to take a leadership role. He allows the 2nd Espada, Barragan, handle the leadership of the Espada. Despite being very powerful, he dislikes violence and will try to talk his way out of a fight. He is not interested in the events going on around him, but he is very observant and analytical. He is fairly similar to Shunsui Kyoraku in personality.<br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>Hueco Mundo/Karakura Showdown</h2><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/855865-stark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-855865\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/855865-stark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-855865\"><img alt=\"Learning about a companions death\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/855865-stark.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/855865-stark.jpg 640w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/855865-stark.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/855865-stark.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Learning about a companions death</figcaption></figure>The first real appearance of Starrk is during the meeting between the Espada, Ichimaru Gin, Kaname Tosen and their leader Aizen who had summoned them all. This meeting deals with the sudden appearance of Ichigo, Chad and Uryu who have come to save Orihime. It is in this meeting that we first get a understanding of Starrks personality as he asks everyone to be quiet as he is tired. Starrk is next shown sleeping after the death of the 9th Espada. His fraccion proceeds to attack him...Showing us their brother and sister like relationship. Starrk though seeming bothered by the death of Aaroniero tells Lillynette want she wants him to do...A reaction that his Fraccion is not to happy with. After the defeat of Grimmjow and Nnoitra Staark was given orders to recapture Orihime. <br /><p><br /></p> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/855901-stark_and_orihime.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-855901\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.565625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/855901-stark_and_orihime.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-855901\"><img alt=\"Starrk retaking orihime\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/855901-stark_and_orihime.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/855901-stark_and_orihime.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Starrk retaking orihime\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/855901-stark_and_orihime.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/855901-stark_and_orihime.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Starrk retaking orihime</figcaption></figure>Starrk makes fools of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42566\" href=\"/kenpachi/4005-42566/\">      Kenpachi</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\" href=\"/ichigo/4005-42468/\">      Ichigo</a> by instantly recapturing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43019\" href=\"/orihime-inoue/4005-43019/\">      Orihime</a> after just rescuing her from the clutches of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54364\" href=\"/nnoitra/4005-54364/\">      Nnorita</a> and his Fraccion Tesla.

None aware that Stark wants to put on a facade while others battle to the death. During a nonchalant skirmish Stark calls Shunsui on his holding back after claiming wanting to engage in actual combat.  <br /> <br />He reveals keen observation in pointing out Shunsui can fight with both hands but only using one of two swords. Stark truly wanted to little to no fighting at all.

Starrk removes his glove and reveals himself to be the primera. Something that does not surprise the 8th division captain in the slightest. The two procede to fight in which Starrk is surprised and also annoyed on how Shunsui is able to dodge all but one of his attacks. Starrk bares witness to the bankais of Hitsugaya and Soifon.....Suprised by their power and wonders if all captains have a bankai of such strength. Wanting to see his opponents bankai.....Starrk reveals that him and Lillynette are one in the same and the two combine to reveal their Ressurection. Now armed with two guns Starrk attacks Shunsui with cero's. Though the captain refuses to release his bankai. Not happy Starrk fires a barrage of cero's at Shunsui. Luckily for the captain his best friend Ukitake negates the attack and returns it to Staark. In just a few more moves he is able to determine how Ukitake's shikai works. Right before Starrk is able to fire 1000 shots Wonderweiss turns up with a large hollow, which surprises Starrk. <br /><br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/862976-07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-862976\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 750px\" data-ratio=\"1.4693333333333\" data-width=\"750\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/862976-07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-862976\"><img alt=\"Starrk finishing off Shunsui\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" data-width=\"435\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/862976-07.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/862976-07.jpg 750w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/862976-07.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/862976-07.jpg 435w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Starrk finishing off Shunsui\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/862976-07.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/862976-07.jpg 750w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/862976-07.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/862976-07.jpg 435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" data-width=\"435\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Starrk finishing off Shunsui</figcaption></figure>During the suprise visit of Wonderweiss, the young arrancar quicks deals a fatal blow to captain Ukitake by impaling him from behind with his hand. Suddenly before Wonderweiss can do any more damage Shunsui appears behind Wonderweiss and prepares for attack.

Starrk comments that the arrival of Wonderweiss means Aizen has grown tired. Recently Wonderweiss has fredd Harribel, Barragan and the three former captains. Just as all hope seems lost the vizards arrive. <br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/900172-42_367v2_mmasb_13.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-900172\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 768px\" data-ratio=\"1.4973958333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/900172-42_367v2_mmasb_13.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-900172\"><img alt=\"Starrk Vs Two Superheroes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\" data-width=\"641\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/900172-42_367v2_mmasb_13.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/900172-42_367v2_mmasb_13.png 768w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/900172-42_367v2_mmasb_13.png 641w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Starrk Vs Two Superheroes\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/900172-42_367v2_mmasb_13.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/900172-42_367v2_mmasb_13.png 768w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/900172-42_367v2_mmasb_13.png 641w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\" data-width=\"641\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Starrk Vs Two Superheroes</figcaption></figure>After the vizards deal with the gillians that the large hollow releases from its mouth. Starrk is confronted by the duo of Love and ose, who comment that Starrk is strong. Upon removing their masks, Starrk comments that should they really be removing their masks. Love says that they are superheroes and that their masks only last for a maximum of 3 minutes.  <br /> <br />After the fall of barragan at the hands of Hachi, Starrk comments that he finds it horrible that Aizen did not utter a single word, for Barragan, but turning towards Rose and Love, he goes on to say that it is not within their nature to avenge each other. After his comrades death, Starrk seems to be unaffected by his fallen comrades demise. Love states, that after someone dies, it becomes a battle of revenge, but Rose seems to think Starrk is not the type to look for revenge. Love then states, that what makes Starrk so scary, as noone can be that detatched. With his back turned to his opponents, Starrk is attacked by Love, who reveals his shikai. Starrk quickly retaliates by shooting at Love, only to have his cer's blocked. Being attacked he manages to dodge Love's attack, and appear right behind him. Though he is not so lucky with the second attack, and is knocked to the ground. Lying on the ground, Lilynette asks why he is just lying there, that isn't he going to get revenge. She then calls him pathetic.  <br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/943272-12_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-943272\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 642px\" data-ratio=\"0.90965732087227\" data-width=\"642\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/943272-12_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-943272\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/943272-12_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/943272-12_1.jpg 642w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/943272-12_1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/943272-12_1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/943272-12_1.jpg 642w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/943272-12_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure>Starrk then again says he is not the type to seek revenge, and that he believes Aizen wont save them. Starrk goes on to say that his opponents are strong, and that he just doesen't care anymore. That if they keep fighting someone else will die. He then says he wants to go home and sleep, which Liylnette resonds to in anger. She says that he is number one and that he should start acting like it. Lilynette goes on to say that Starrk has just been acting cool and not even trying, and the reason Aizen made him number one is because he believes in his strength. She says that if he doesen't want to see his friends die, he should fight. Stark says she is right. He gets back up, and is again attacked by Love, but blocks the attack. Love asks if Starrk was grieving, and Starrk resonds by saying something like that. Love goes on to say he thought holows have no hearts, which Starrk resonds by saying, Look who's talking you look like a hollw yourself with that mask. Love then dons his hollow mask, and attacks Starrk with shikai's special ability. <br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-943259\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1019px\" data-ratio=\"0.48577036310108\" data-width=\"1019\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-943259\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg 1019w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg 1019w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg 960w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/943259-18_19_4_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>Love then takes off his hollow mask, and states that Starrk has once again dissapeared. And he wonders were his opponent has went. Rose shocked and looking to the sky, says he is above you. Love to looks up, with shock, and says what the hell is that. It then shows Starrk, standing in front, of what looks like a large pack of wolves. <br /> <br />Starrk used the wolves to attack Love and Rose. Both of them don their masks. Rose release his Zanpakuto. They try to attack but nothing happen. Two wolves bite down on Love and Rose. The wolves explosion both love and rose can't fight back. Starrk tell them \" If you make a run for it I won't chase you.\" Then Love tell him \"Don't make me laugh.\" Starrk is abount to kill both of them only to be attacked from behind by Shunsui. After realazing he got stabbed by Shunsui, he retreats quickly and tells Shunsui how he held such a ridiculous power when they fought (hiding in the shadows and being able to attack from them), Shunsui states that his sword wasn't in the mood of playing that game (Kageoni), then he reveals to Starrk that his shinkai ability is to make childrens game real, after hearing this Starrk quickly dodges another shadow based attack from shunsui, and heads for the sky, shunsui pursues him and starts attacking him with another game (Irooni), the rules are you say a color, and that color is the one you cut, Starrk dons Spiritual dual Blades to battle Shunsui, Starrk gets cut in his arm, but notices it not a deep cut like he felt. Starrk instantly realizes the rule of the game. Shunsui said Grey and slashed Starrk wrist, which is gray, but it wasn't that deep, so he concluded that becuase Shunsui did not had grey in his clothes, the cut was not that deep. When Shunsui told Starrk that it was his turn, Starrk said White and attacked Shunsui and severely injured him with a deep blow to his back (Starrk main color is White and Shunsui has a White Shinigami robe so the attack is more fatal). Shunsui quickly acknowledges Starrk's analitical mastermind and says to him that he is a real strong opponent, the two continue to fight, during this Starrk starts to remember how weak he wanted to be all the time, he wanted to be with other hollows but they all died when he was near him, he then says to himself that he divided himself into 2 being so couldn't be alone, and he says how he always envied the weak, he wanted to be weak, or to fight someone as strong as him, he still continues battling Shunsui but  Shunsui removes his cape and says Black (shinigami robe is complete Black, making the attack more powerful) and cuts Starrk from waist to chest (like and uppercut). Starrk starts to fall from that last slash, and starts to remember the first time he met Aizen. A deep wound which reaches to his hollow hole makes his chest explode in blood, now falling he apologizes to Aizen for not paying his debt, he recalls his Espada Comrades (except Yammy), then recalls when he divided into two beings and asking Lilynette's name, later stating that they would stick together forever, after that last memory he falls to the battleground of the Fake Karakura Town imploding into it.  <br /><p><u><b><br /><br /><br /></b></u></p><h2>Powers and abilities</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-854809\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 835px\" data-ratio=\"0.6874251497006\" data-width=\"835\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-854809\"><img alt=\"A lazy Cero\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg 835w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A lazy Cero\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg 835w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/854809-stark_cero.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A lazy Cero</figcaption></figure>As he is the primera Espada in Aizen's army. Starrk has powers and skills above that of any other Espada shown thus far....With the possible exception of Yammy. Being the number one Starrk has an incredible high spirit power...So high that he forbidden to release it in los noches..As such power could lay waste to it. When he was first shown....His only ability shown was that of Sonido...Which like flash steps is a high speed movement. In Starrks case this movement is incredibly fast. He was able to capture Orihime without Ichigo and Kenpachi noticing him..And take her away before either could hit with their attacks. He can keep up with Ukitake and Shunsui...Two of the strongest captains in the series. Starrk is also a great swordsman and a tactical fighter. This is shown when after only seeing Ukitake's special ability 3 times..He was able to figure out its nature of attack. He can also use the other typical Arrancar abilities such as Cero which he can fire from his body...Without taking a battle stance....And garganata which allows him to travel across dimenions. <br /><p><br /></p> <p><u><b>Ressurection</b></u></p> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844517-starkll.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844517\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 556px\" data-ratio=\"1.0863309352518\" data-width=\"556\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844517-starkll.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844517\"><img alt=\"Los Lobos\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px\" data-width=\"589\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844517-starkll.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844517-starkll.jpg 556w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/844517-starkll.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Los Lobos\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844517-starkll.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844517-starkll.jpg 556w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/844517-starkll.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px\" data-width=\"589\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Los Lobos</figcaption></figure>To get a clearer understanding of Starrk's release form.....We must first look at his Zanpakuto. Which appears as a regular katana much like most zanpakuto's that have appeared in the series. Both the sheath and the guard of zanpakuto appears as a pewtrid yellow. So far all the other Espada...And the Arrancar have their ressurection forms....Sealed in their zanpakuto. Starrk is unique though. As his own release form is instead sealed inside his fraccion...Lillynette..Though she is in fact his other half. As they split once they became Arrancar. This resurrection is known as Los Lobos....Or The Wolves. Its command of release being Kick About. In this form Stark wields two decorative guns...Which is in fact Lillynette who is still able to communicate. His outfit also changes drastically and he increases in over all strength. Starrk's guns are capable of firing Cero's.....Even able to unleash a barrage and claiming he can shoot 1000 shots at once.   <br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1052762\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 972px\" data-ratio=\"1.2777777777778\" data-width=\"972\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1052762\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px\" data-width=\"751\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg 972w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg 960w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg 751w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg 972w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg 960w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052762-wolves_attack.jpg 751w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px\" data-width=\"751\"></noscript></a></figure>In this form Starrk's hierro also increases granting him a vast increase in durability. He took a direct hit from Love's shikai and only mustered a half hearted ow. Even being stabbed from behind by Shunsui did not derail his battle prowess. His greatest power is the ability to split his and Lillynette's soul and summon a pack of wolves. The wolves take on a flaming appearance that can instantly regenerate. These wolves are able to explode when coming in contact with their enemies. The explosive force is great enough to make Love nd Rose notably exhausted and worn out.  <br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1052764\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 974px\" data-ratio=\"0.9958932238193\" data-width=\"974\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1052764\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg 974w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg 974w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg 960w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/1052764-starrk_s_sword.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>Finally Starrk has shown he can create two blades formed out of spiritual energy. These blades are just as strong as any normal blade, perhaps even stronger due to Starrk's amazing spiritual power. He used these blades to combat Shunsui's dual shikai. <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><h2>  Relationships </h2><br /> <br />Starrk is one of those characters, who does not interact with the other charaters as much as some, especially in his own ranks. Though he does not seem to care about his fellow hollows, appearing laid back, and detached when they are killed. However Starrk does care for his fellow hollows, but the same cant be said for Aizen. Though he likely respects Aizen, he does not care to much for him. Starrk also has a better relationship, with the shinigami than the other hollows do, in particular Shunsui. Their personality, and way of doing things make them a lot alike.  <br /> <br /><u><b>Lilynette</b></u> <br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844532-stark14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844532\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 649px\" data-ratio=\"0.95069337442219\" data-width=\"649\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844532-stark14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844532\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/844532-stark14.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844532-stark14.jpg 649w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/844532-stark14.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/844532-stark14.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/844532-stark14.jpg 649w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/844532-stark14.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure>The most notable relationship that Starrk has in the series is between him, and his fraccion, later revealed other half Lilynette. The two share a deep bond, clear as the two were once one hollow. There relationship, can be viewed as a typical, brother younger sister one. Starrk who is often sleeping, and relaxing, would often get surprise attacks from Lilynette, hitting him, and trying to motivate him, in particular doing something about his comrades deaths. Though she often attacks Starrk, it is clear she cares for him, and respects him and his power greatly. She is willing to do what she is told, if she knows its the right thing to do. Out of all the people Lilynette is perhaps the only person to motivate Starrk, into showing his true power, and to avenge the fallen. <br /> <br /><h2>Aspect of Death</h2>Each Espada represents and aspect of death, which are the 10 reasons human die, Starrk's aspect of death is <strong>Loneliness</strong>, this represents his battle style, which refers on how strong he becomes when he fuses with his other (Lilynette), when he becomes one he extremely powerful, but as stated by him he hates ''this pain in the ass release'', maybe because he is alone.

    "description": "<p>Luigi Mario is the brother of acclaimed plumber <a href=\"/mario/4005-54941/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54941\">Mario Mario</a>. Luigi is known for his tall, slender physique and his green outfit with the \"L\" on his cap. Luigi can jump higher and is faster than Mario, yet Mario is known as the hero of the family, even though Luigi often does as much work as Mario.</p><p>While Mario made his first appearance in <em>Donkey Kong</em>. Luigi made his first appearnce in the 1983 game <em>Mario Bros</em>. He would later achieve fame along with Mario in the much more famous 1985 game <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. </p><p>Luigi became the first rate hero when he went into a haunted house, in order to save Mario, and sucked up all the ghosts with a vacuum given to him by a mad scientist named Professor E. Gadd. </p><p>His love is for princess Daisy, princess <a href=\"/princess-peach/4005-55485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55485\">Peach's</a> sister.</p><p>He appears in most Mario games by Nintendo and some as a playable character. Notable games he HASN'T appeared in include Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.</p><p>Luigi is taller than Mario and can jump further as he has longer legs, but he also has worse traction.</p><p>Luigi's has a mustache just like Mario!</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Unassisted by any caps, Luigi has the ability to shoot fireballs from his hand which gravity has no effect on at all. He can also jump higher and run faster than his brother Mario. Luigi's upper-cut jump can also light an enemy on fire if he is standing directly next to him, referred to as the \"Pow.\" It has been shown that Luigi is more powerful than Mario, but simply lacks the courage and confidence to reach his true potential. </p><h2>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</h2><p>Luigi is the dreamy, comical man this time round in brawl. You have to unlock him to play him in any type of brawls, making him one of the only two characters to be unlockable in all three SSB games, the other being Jiggylpuff. His new title in Brawl is \"every one's favorite guy in green!\". </p><p>Here is his list of moves:</p><ul><li>Standard Special move (B)= Fireball</li><li>Side Special move (side B)= Green Missile</li><li>Up Special move (up B)= Super jump punch</li><li>Down Special move (down B)= Luigi Cyclone</li><li>Final Smash= Negative Zone</li></ul><p> </p>",

    "deck": "An evil enemy of Mario. He is Mario's rival and his greedy doppelganger. He first appeared in Mario Land 2, and stole the show to create Wario Land, which evolved into Wario Ware. He has a brother named Waluigi.",
    "description": "<p>Wario is the evil doppelganger of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54941\" href=\"/mario/4005-54941/\"> Mario</a> and appeared in the comic \"MARIO vs WARIO\". Although his comic appearances are far and few, Wario has shown his strengths in the Wario Land series, and even created a video game developing company in the WarioWare series. He also appears as a new playable character in Super Smash Bros Brawl, where he can be played as in his WarioWare attire or his plumber garbs. He often teams up with Waluigi, Luigi's evil double, but the exact relationship between the two mischief makers isn't clear.</p><p><br /></p><p>Despite where or what series in which it may be, Wario's powers typically revolve around his herculean strength. (As an example, note that Wario typically punches and pile-drives his foes where as Mario sticks to stomping.) His power is immense to the point that, for two games in the Wario Land series, he was virtually invincible, eliminating all possible \"game-overs\". In Wario World, Wario's list of moves were nearly all beat-'em-up tactics, save for the obvious jump and run.  Some other skills he has displayed are as follows:</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Rushing through solid surfaces such as brick without taking any damage.</li><li>Using various power-ups in a manner similar to Mario.</li><li>Using certain types of enemy attacks to his advantage, such as using fire to become a blazing juggernaut, or transforming into a zombie/vampire.</li><li>Eating a clove of garlic to become Wario-Man, a state in which his speed and agility are enhance immensely and attains the power of flight.<br /></li></ul>",

She lived a satisfying life style as the mobster's wife until she had an extramarital affair, which Frankie ultimately discovered. Her husband then tortured and killed her lover while forcing Lauren to watch. This event was so traumatic, that it left her in catatonic like state for the rest of her life. It was later discovered that her daughter, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50729\" href=\"/appolonia-franchetti/4005-50729/\" slug=\"appolonia-franchetti\">          Appolonia</a>, also witnessed the cruel act that caused her mothers state. Vowing revenge against her father, Appolonia attempted to summon the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43945\" href=\"/the-angelus/4005-43945/\" slug=\"the-angelus\">         Angelus</a>, however, the entity chose Lauren over Appolonia.   While the Angelus entity, which normally completely takes over its host, allowed a portion of Lauren's personality to exist. This was evident by the fact that she still considered Appolonia to be her daughter. However, this eventually ended what Lauren decided to finally give herself to the Angelus, allowing to completely supplant her will.  <br/> <br/>After a number of confrontations with her with her adopted nephew, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24347\" href=\"/the-darkness/4005-24347/\" slug=\"the-darkness\">        Jackie Estacado</a>, the current bearer of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24347\" href=\"/the-darkness/4005-24347/\" slug=\"the-darkness\">     the Darkness</a>, Lauren was killed when Appolonia herself stabbed her mother with the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-47001\" href=\"/spear-of-destiny/4055-47001/\" slug=\"spear-of-destiny\">    Spear of Destiny</a>.  Lauren, now herself again tried to warn Jackie, Appolonia and Patience that the Angelus would seek a new host (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-43829\" href=\"/magdalena/4005-43829/\" slug=\"magdalena\">  Patience</a>) but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43945\" href=\"/the-angelus/4005-43945/\" slug=\"the-angelus\"> </a>failed to do so in time.  However Patience was able to expel the ancient force and it left to find a new host.   Before dying Lauren wept tears of joy that her  suffering was finally allowed to end and she was genuinely happy to see both her daughter and Jackie one final time before passing away.",

However, whilst putting them in place Mouse was discovered by Imperial Troopers who were extremely wary and suspicious of what he was doing, they ordered him to take off his helmet. And as they stod staring at him dumbstruck, he made a run for it towards the maintenance tunnels. Despite the troopers finding him and gunning him down, Mouse was sill able to trigger some of the diversionary explosives, something which secured success of his companions.</p>",

That is because only television shows and movies are considered canon for Star Trek. This being a comic website there are many things here that are not canon. So unless it is contradicted in film it should be listed as part of the character biography.</p><p>Part of O'Brien's early career was in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58369\" href=\"/cardassians/4060-58369/\" slug=\"cardassians\">Cardassian</a> War aboard the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56804\" href=\"/uss-rutledge/4055-56804/\" slug=\"uss-rutledge\">U.S.S. Rutledge</a> and it shaped him greatly into the man he became. Through a chance life and death situation he found that he had a skill for engineering. He also built a real dislike/hatred for the Cardassians. This dislike/hatred for Cardassians is something he struggled with for decades after the war. After the war O'Brien was stationed on the Flagship of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56645\" href=\"/united-federation-of-planets/4060-56645/\" slug=\"united-federation-of-planets\">Federation</a> and had a role in it's first mission and many more afterwards.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1900358-star_trek_vi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1900358\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3141592920354\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1900358-star_trek_vi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1900358\"><img alt=\"A Married Couple\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1900358-star_trek_vi.png\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1900358-star_trek_vi.png 226w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-width=\"226\"></a><figcaption>A Married Couple</figcaption></figure><p>The character of O'Brien was created during the Star Trek: The next Generation Television show. His character however evolved very slowly unlike many other characters. He was first seen in the pilot episode of the show but had no name attributed to him. His rank and title changed as well as the series went on. By the fourth season however O'Brien had a name and some minor characteristics that were sprinkled about as the show had gone on. Most importantly was that he was a non-commissioned (non-com) officer.</p><p>Being a non-com O'Brien represented all the enlisted personal on the show. He was also a family man who actually was allowed to marry and have a family on the show and have them be a regular part of the series. This was especially true when the character became one of the main characters in the next Star Trek show, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9).</p><p>Since O'Brien wasn't originally suppose to be a main cast member he was allowed to grow as a character. In Next Generation he got married and had his first child. When DS9 started the whole family of characters became a part of the show.</p><p>Another part of his evolution that was not a smooth transfer was his rank. The show the Next Generation never really dealt with non commissioned crewmen and the rank insignia was not well established for these ranks. O'Brien even wore the rank of Lieutenant and was even called one on the show. Most the time however he was referred to as chief. It was not until about halfway through the Deep Space Nine series that his rank insignia was clearly established.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21859/448239-ds9_free.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-448239\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.76589595375723\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21859/448239-ds9_free.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-448239\"><img alt=\"Miles and Bashir\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21859/448239-ds9_free.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21859/448239-ds9_free.jpg 692w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21859/448239-ds9_free.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Miles and Bashir\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21859/448239-ds9_free.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21859/448239-ds9_free.jpg 692w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21859/448239-ds9_free.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Miles and Bashir</figcaption></figure><p>Once O'Brien transferred to the Enterprise his life really began to grow as he met and married Keiko. Miles and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-63086\" href=\"/keiko-obrien/4005-63086/\" slug=\"keiko-obrien\">Keiko O'Brien</a> also had their first child Molly O'Brien who was born during a crisis situation that resulted in the Tactical Officer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21619\" href=\"/worf/4005-21619/\" slug=\"worf\">Worf</a> delivering the child. The new family was only together a short time before Miles was assigned to the O'Brien Space station.</p><p>Keiko was not real happy on DS9 and only found a purpose when she opened up a school. O'Brien himself had a hard time at first. The technology on the ship was part Cardassian, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57482\" href=\"/bajorans/4060-57482/\" slug=\"bajorans\">Bajoran</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56645\" href=\"/united-federation-of-planets/4060-56645/\" slug=\"united-federation-of-planets\">Federation</a> so it was a very complicated system to work with.

The irony in this is they became the very best of friends and were virtually inseparable as they served together. Bahsir was there for Miles during his darkest times.</p><p>No time was darker for O'Brien than when he was sentence and convicted to a crime of espionage that he didn't even commit. Not only was he sentence but he served about twenty years in prison. What O'Brien did not know was that his incarceration was imposed upon him by an alien technology so that O'Brien did not age or even spend any real time in prison but his mind felt that he did. O'Brien couldn't even adjust to time on the station. He became haunted by the image of his friend and cell mate he had killed because he believed he was stealing food. He was so bothered by it that he tried to kill himself and it was Bashir who convinced him to live.</p><p>O'Brien and Keiko would go on and have another child and after the Dominion War, Miles would go back to planet earth to teach engineering at <a data-ref-id=\"4060-51128\" href=\"/starfleet/4060-51128/\" slug=\"starfleet\">Starfleet</a>. This was an odd move for him as he loved to work on challenging problems and seemed to have a need for action. It is likely that he will not be there long.</p>",

    "deck": "Lady Bullseye is an assassin that works for the Hand. A former sex slave of the Yakuza, she escaped after Daredevil's enemy Bullseye infiltrated and slaughtered the gang. His martial prowess served as the girl's inspiration.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Not too much is known about Lady Bullseye. As a teenage girl, she was one of many female sex slaves of the Yakuza in Tokyo being used, tortured and broken. While being held captive in a cell with other female slaves, she witnessed the assassin known as <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\"> Bullseye</a> at work. He infiltrated a Yakuza warehouse where he systematically slaughtered numbers of soldiers. When she saw him in action, she had never seen anything so beautiful. She remembers the violence brought upon by Bullseye so vividly and remembers the joy she beheld from her cage while these men were getting killed. She was able to grab a set of keys from a dead soldier and escape from her cell. A Yakuza soldier ordered her back into her cage but she just slashed his neck with the key and watched him die. She vowed from that day on, no man would touch her without permission.</p><p>Years later she was called upon by Lord Hirochi of the Hand and she chose the name of Lady Bullseye for reasons of her own. The Hand is currently at war with itself and Lord Hirochi does not want all he has plan and achieved to fall into ancient feuds. He hired Lady Bullseye as an outsider to help end this conflict. within the group.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lady Bullseye was created by writers <a href=\"/ed-brubaker/4040-41468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41468\"> Ed Brubaker</a>, <a href=\"/marko-djurdjevic/4040-41682/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41682\"> Marko Djurdjevic</a> and <a href=\"/clay-mann/4040-46574/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-46574\"> Clay Mann</a> in 2008. She was originally inspired by Lady Snowblood, a manga femme fatal who was set on a task of vengeance for the murder of her family. Lady Bullseye was introduced into the comic book world in <a href=\"/daredevil/4050-6209/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-6209\"> Daredevil</a> # 111.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Hand</h3><p><a href=\"/lady-bullseye/4005-55499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55499\"> Lady Bullseye</a> is currently employed by the <a href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\"> Hand</a> and follows the command of Lord Hirochi. Lady Bullseye and the Hand are currently targeting several of New York's skilled fighters including Carlos LaMuerto aka the <a href=\"/black-tarantula/4005-8669/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8669\"> Black Tarantula</a> and <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\"> Danny Rand</a>, the Immortal Iron Fist. Lady Bullseye has observed these two fighters from a distance while they are attacked by the Hand ninjas. These skilled fighters are being \"tested\" by the Hand for reasons unknown at this time. Carlos and an old enemy of the Hand named Master Izo are led to an area by some ninjas. They discover more pictures on a wall that reveal more targets. Their is a picture of <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\"> Wolverine</a> crossed out by a red X and other fighters like <a href=\"/shang-chi/4005-12716/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12716\"> Shang Chi</a> are revealed.</p><p>Lord Hirochi wants Matt Murdock to be kept away from their business before they can risk exposure. Lady Bullseye took matters into her own hands by framing <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\"> Daredevil</a> for murder after killing two street thugs and forcing a witness to tell the police and media that Daredevil was the killer. She tells Lord Hirochi that Matt Murdock was too close to those Hirochi wanted tested and had to be distracted. She then promises on her life that she would make certain that Murdock is prepared for the gift Hirochi and the Hand will bring him. Daredevil would meet Lady Bullseye on a stormy night on a building rooftop. After a brief skirmish, she reveals to Daredevil that her and the Hand are targeting Murdock's family and friends. Daredevil is suddenly surrounded by numerous ninjas and is attacked. Master Izo would soon arrive and help Daredevil take out the ninjas. Lady Bullseye has escaped to take care of another issue. A friend of Matt Murdock named <a href=\"/white-tiger/4005-1925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1925\"> Angela Del Toro</a> aka the <a href=\"/white-tiger/4005-1925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1925\"> White Tiger</a> would be one of Lady Bullseye's latest victims. She comes home after a long night and comes across Lady Bullseye and some ninjas. Lady Bullseye stabs White Tiger through the chest, apparently killing White Tiger.</p><p>It was later revealed that the Hand turned White Tiger into one of their 'puppet' and soon they went after Black Tarantula who also was turned after being killed.Eventually Daredevil faced and battled Lady Bullseye who revealed that all of this was just a trial, test to have Daredevil as the new Supreme Leader of the Hand.</p><p>Days later after being attacked by the Hand, Wilson Fisk aka. The Kingpin of Crime returned to New York City to end their and for a short period of time he even teamed up with Matt Murdock alias Daredevil.Turned out that Lady Bullseye was hired by the Owl who was rescued from prison and now worked for the Kingpin.After a brutal fight with Daredevil-Owl-Lady Bullseye and the Kingpin of Crime, Kingpin and Lady Bullseye flee from the scene.</p><h3><a href=\"/shadowland/4045-56114/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56114\"> Shadowland</a></h3><p>During the \"Shadowland\" story arc, Lady Bullseye is still working for Wilson Fisk as his right hand.</p><h3>Elektra</h3><p>Lady Bullseye, along with various other assassins, is hired by the Guild of Assassins to kill <a href=\"/cape-crow/4005-101482/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-101482\">Cape Crow</a>, a retired assassin. She clashes with <a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra</a>, who is trying to protect him, and Elektra defeats her after a close fight. Left for dead, Lady Bullseye is then captured by <a href=\"/bloody-lips/4005-101919/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-101919\">Bloody Lips</a>, another assassin, who is able to absorb people's abilities by eating parts of them. He eats part of Lady Bullseye and absorbs her abilities.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4212654-screen+shot+2014-11-10+at+9.51.26+am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4212654\" data-ratio=\"1.9019607843137\" data-width=\"255\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 255px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:190.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4212654-screen+shot+2014-11-10+at+9.51.26+am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4212654\"><img alt=\"Her new gaseous form\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4212654-screen+shot+2014-11-10+at+9.51.26+am.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/4212654-screen+shot+2014-11-10+at+9.51.26+am.png 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px\" data-width=\"255\"></a><figcaption>Her new gaseous form</figcaption></figure><p>He brings her along in his ship as he follows Elektra to the Arctic. Elektra defeats Blood Lips and Lady Bullseye escapes from the ship into the cold of the Arctic. At death's door from her fight with Elektra, being partially eaten by Bloody Lips, and being in the Arctic with no cold weather gear, she calls on the Guild of Assassins to rescue her.</p><p>They bring her back to their base and heal her, but since she has no money, she agrees to pay by allowing them to inject her with an experimental treatment that gives her new powers.</p><p>Now able to turn into gaseous form, she once again confronts Elektra, but Elektra is able to trick her into turning solid and seemingly kills her.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Lady Bullseye is an assassin highly skilled in hand to hand combat. She has been trained in many forms of martial arts and is skilled with various weapons from the East. She also has the ability to remain extremely calm under stressful conditions. Daredevil has a hard time anticipating her moves and gauging her speed because she remains so calm.</p><p>She was given the ability to turn all or parts of her body into gaseous form by the Guild of Assassins. She can change from one state to the other very quickly. However Elektra was able to wound her by inhaling part of her face, so apparently she must retain all of her molecules.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Games</h3><h4>Marvel: War of Heroes</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4969663-lady.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4969663\" data-ratio=\"1.252380952381\" data-width=\"210\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4969663-lady.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4969663\"><img alt=\"Marvel: War of Heroes\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4969663-lady.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4969663-lady.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\"></a><figcaption>Marvel: War of Heroes</figcaption></figure><p>Lady Bullseye appears in several cards in the mobile card game Marvel: War of Heroes.

    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2><p>Kazuya Mishima was born to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58965\" href=\"/heihachi-mishima/4005-58965/\" slug=\"heihachi-mishima\">Heihachi Mishima </a>and Kazume Mishima. His mother Kazume was a kind and nurturing woman, but his father Heihachi was the ruthless CEO of the Mishima Zaibatsu. When Kazuya was born, Kazume immediately died. Heihachi grieved for his wife and wanted to raise his son to be strong and unyielding. However, Kazuya became a kind and frail boy and that was not satisfactory for Heihachi. Heihachi decided to throw Kazuya off of a cliff to toughen him up, as lions throw their cubs off a cliff and raise the ones that survive. Kazuya had survived, but only through a deal with Devil and was scarred on his chest for life. As a result of this, Kazuya would become more cold and distant and hone his karate skills to lethal effect. He won karate tournaments, one after another, as the only one to ever take him to a draw was the American Judo fighter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59551\" href=\"/paul-phoenix/4005-59551/\" slug=\"paul-phoenix\">Paul Phoenix.</a> He did this for 16 years until Heihachi announced the King of Iron Fist Tournament. Kazuya, aged 26, entered the tournament to take down his father and settle his feud. Along the way, he fought his adopted brother Lee Chaolan and defeated him. It would be Kazuya who would face Heihachi in the final round, right on the same cliff Kazuya had fell off when he was ten. Father and son clashed and it would be Kazuya who would be the victor. He then dropped his father off the cliff in the name of revenge and took control of the Mishima Zaibatsu.  </p><h2>Creation </h2>The character of Kazuya Mishima, is first introduced in the popular fighting video game franchise Tekken. Kazuya Mishima was the original protagonist of the Tekken franchise and much of the core root of the games story line originate and includes him. His first appearance was in the first Tekken game, and since then he has gone on to switch from protagonist and antagonist with each games release. He appears in the <a data-ref-id=\"4010-2960\" href=\"/namco-bandai/4010-2960/\" slug=\"namco-bandai\">Namco Bandai</a> produced comic <a data-ref-id=\"4050-21510\" href=\"/tekken-forever/4050-21510/\" slug=\"tekken-forever\">Tekken Forever #1</a>. <br/><br/><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><h3>King of Iron Fist 2</h3><p>When Kazuya ruled the Mishima Zaibatsu, he did so with corruption. He involved drug trafficking, animal smuggling, and assassination. Kazuya, now 28, had everything a young man could want, so he then decided to announce the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2. He hired the Irish assassin <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59558\" href=\"/anna-williams/4005-59558/\" slug=\"anna-williams\">Anna Williams</a>, sumo wrestler <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59556\" href=\"/ganryu/4005-59556/\" slug=\"ganryu\">Ganryu,</a> and Muay Thai kickboxer Bruce Irvin to work for him as bodyguards. He had fingers in many pies and several enemies in this stint. WWWC officer Jun Kazama was sent to arrest him for animal smuggling. Hong Kong police detective Lei Wulong was to investigate his corruption. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59559\" href=\"/nina-williams/4005-59559/\" slug=\"nina-williams\">Nina Williams </a>was hired to assassinate him. Kazuya wanted the mystical amulet of Michelle Chang's tribe, so he had Ganryu kidnapped her mother and caused her to participate. He had also arranged for Dr. Geppetto Boskonovitch to be kidnapped, which is why Jack-2 and Yoshimitsu got involved; Jack-2 wanted an upgrade while Yoshimitsu wanted to rescue the doctor. Most of all, Heihachi had survived the cliff fall and had trained for two years to defeat his son. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58966\" href=\"/jun-kazama/4005-58966/\" slug=\"jun-kazama\">Jun</a> had made contact with Kazuya, but could not help being drawn to him and got pregnant because of him. Later in the tournament, Heihachi and Kazuya would once again lock horns. This was a different outcome; although Kazuya had the Devil powers on his side, Heihachi emerged victorious. He then decided that his son was too dangerous and dropped him into a volcano while regaining the Mishima Zaibatsu.</p><h3>King of Iron Fist 4</h3><p>21 years later, Kazuya's remains were taken in by the cutting-edge technology firm G Corporation and he was revived. Kazuya let the researchers conduct research on him to find out more about his Devil Gene and he later heard about of King of Iron Fist 4. Kazuya knew it was a trap orchestrated by Heihachi to draw him and his own son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51617\" href=\"/jin-kazama/4005-51617/\" slug=\"jin-kazama\">Jin Kazama</a> out. He decided to enter anyways to defeat his father and take the other half of the Devil Gene from his son. Once again, Kazuya would face Heihachi in the final round, but lost again. Heihachi would then take Kazuya to see Jin in the Hon-Maru temple. Kazuya would use his Devil powers to knock out Heihachi and then challenged his chained-up son to a battle. Jin broke loose and the two squared off. Kazuya would lose the fight along with Heihachi who had also tried to challenge Jin. Jin spared the both of them and flew off on his wings.</p><h3>King of Iron Fist 5</h3><p>When Kazuya and Heihachi awoke from their beatings, Jack-4 robots started bursting in. Father and son would then fight together against the robots for a short period of time. But when Heihachi began to tire, Kazuya betrayed his father and threw him into a Jack-4 detonation while he himself flew away in Devil form. Knowing that the Jack-4 units came from G Corporation, Kazuya vowed revenge against the firm's betrayal by entering the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5.</p><h3>King of Iron Fist 6</h3><p>Although Kazuya did not win, he did find out which branch of G Corporation betrayed him and killed them all, becoming the head of the company. It would then be a corporate battle between him and his son Jin (who had usurped the Mishima Zaibatsu). The world viewed him as good while Jin was shunned because of his world conquest. Kazuya uses this to his advantage for his own world domination plans and he would start by putting a price on Jin's head while entering his son's King of Iron Fist Tournament 6 to increase the odds of his son's silence.  </p> <br/><h2>Powers and Abilities </h2>Kazuya Mishima is an seasoned and veteran fighter who employs a fighting style known as Advanced Mishima style Fighting Karate.  <br/> <br/><h2>Other Media </h2> <h3>Movies</h3><b>Tekken (2010) </b><br/> Released in 2010 Kazuya is featured in the movie <a data-ref-id=\"4025-814\" href=\"/tekken/4025-814/\" slug=\"tekken\">Tekken</a>  in a main role. Kazuya Mishima is portrayed by well known actor Ian Anthony Dale.

He is the largest member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56071\" href=\"/espada/4060-56071/\" slug=\"espada\"> Espada</a>. He has long bushy sideburns, a thin ponytail and a bald ridged cranium. He has orange eyebrows and red markings underneath his eyes. He wears the arrancar uniform, but his jacket is always left open, revealing his muscular chest. His hollow hole is located on his chest. The remains of his hollow mask appear as a jawbone which rests on his chin. His Espada number is tattooed on his left shoulder. When Yammy transforms into his released state, the number changes from 10 to 0. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><h2>Personality</h2> <br/>Yammy is shown to be brutal and arrogant. He is the biggest of the Espada, but not the brightest. He relies on his brute strength and not tactic on the battle field. He seems to derive pleasure from killing and hurting others. Yammy seems to have no regard for his allies, referring to them as trash on occasion. He does seem to have a degree of respect for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51716\" href=\"/ulquiorra-schiffer/4005-51716/\" slug=\"ulquiorra-schiffer\">  Ulquiorra</a>, who acts as his instructor and enforcer when they are out on missions together.<br/><p> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/></p><h2> History</h2><p><br/></p><h3><u>Arrancar Arc</u></h3> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863760-06__.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-863760\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.464\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863760-06__.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-863760\"><img alt=\"Yammy and Ulquiorra\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/863760-06__.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863760-06__.jpg 750w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/863760-06__.jpg 480w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/863760-06__.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Yammy and Ulquiorra</figcaption></figure>Yammy Rialgo is one of the many arrancar in Sosuke Aizen's army, and one of the few espada in which he holds the rank of deecima. The spanish for the number ten. Yammy makes his first official appearance during the arrancar arc. In which him and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51716\" href=\"/ulquiorra-schiffer/4005-51716/\" slug=\"ulquiorra-schiffer\">         Ulquiorra</a> seemingly fall from the sky. Their decent causes a large crater to appear in karakura town. Something which attracts the attention of many of the citizens nearby. This is the first major appearance of the Espada though they are not known as such until later on. During their arrival Ichigo and soul society become aware of their sudden arrival. Yammy comments that he had visited the human world a few times with his mask on and that it is still boring. He also comments on the lack of spiritual energy. This prompts an an annoyed reaction from Ulquiorra in which yammy apologizes...Showing just who is in charge. All the while the two are surrounded by people who Yammy thinks is staring at him....Despite them seeing nothing. Annoyed Yammy sucks out their souls. Only Tatsuki is able to survive the attack from Yammy. <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863803-ichigo_vs_yammy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-863803\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863803-ichigo_vs_yammy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-863803\"><img alt=\"Yammy vs Ichigo\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/863803-ichigo_vs_yammy.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863803-ichigo_vs_yammy.jpg 640w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22021/863803-ichigo_vs_yammy.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/863803-ichigo_vs_yammy.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Yammy vs Ichigo</figcaption></figure>Thinking because <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47778\" href=\"/tatsuki-arisawa/4005-47778/\" slug=\"tatsuki-arisawa\">          Tatsuki</a> survived his gonzui, tat she was a strong spirit and the person that him and Ulquiora had been sent to scout. Ulquiora tells him differently and that she is just trash because she was close to fainting just being near Yammy....Who then decides to kill her. Yammy is then stopped by the sudden appearance of Chad and Orihime. Chad engages Yammy in a fight which the espada makes short work of, as he crushes Chad's arm with little effort. Yammy then has a fight with Orihime after she returned to save Chad. In the fight she reveals her unique abilities....But is powerless against Yammy's strength who crushes Tsubaki. Just as Yammy is about to kill her.....Ichigo shows p and saves Orihime. It becomes aware that the person they had come to scout was Ichigo. Yammy immediately attacks but his attack was easily stopped by Ichig's bankai. Yammy then has is arm cut off by Ichigo. After this Ichigo's hollow starts to show...Causing Ichigo to force it back. This gives Yammy an opening and he procedes to beat Ichigo and Orihime. <br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863844-uruhara_vs_yammy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-863844\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863844-uruhara_vs_yammy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-863844\"><img alt=\"Kisuke Vs Yammy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/863844-uruhara_vs_yammy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863844-uruhara_vs_yammy.jpg 400w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/863844-uruhara_vs_yammy.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kisuke Vs Yammy\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/863844-uruhara_vs_yammy.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22021/863844-uruhara_vs_yammy.jpg 400w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22021/863844-uruhara_vs_yammy.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kisuke Vs Yammy</figcaption></figure>Just before Yammy can do any more damage to Ichgo. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43021\" href=\"/kisuke-urahara/4005-43021/\" slug=\"kisuke-urahara\">        Kisuke Urahara</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47126\" href=\"/yoruichi-shihouin/4005-47126/\" slug=\"yoruichi-shihouin\">       Yoruichi Shihoin</a> save up to put a stop to his attack. Overconfident Yammy attacks the pair but he is easily tossed aside by Yoruichi. Deciding to attack again.....Yammy is yet again defeated by Yorichi who knocks him down. Getting angrier by being handled so easily by Yoruichi. Again he attacks her but only this time he attacks with a cero but the attack is stopped by Kisuke who uses benhime to launch an attack. Ulquiorra then steps in and stops it. Yammy is then hit by Ulquiorra and told that he stands no chance against either of Kisuke and Yoruichi in his current state. The two arrancar then retreat back to Hueco Mundo. Back at Hueco Mundo Yammy has his arm reattached and tests it out by attacking the girl who had reattached it. Yammy along with Grimmjow, Wonderweiss and Luppi are sent back to the living world to launch an offensive. Yammy engages Toshiro in a fight but Luppi soon takes over and fights, leaving Yammy with no opponent. Yammy is then shown watching over Wonderweiss who is playing with the dragonflies. Later on during the fight between Luppi and the shinigami Kisuke arrives. Yammy then attacks Kisuke, wanting revenge from their last encounter. The fight is one which Yammy again seems to be losing.

    "deck": "Szayel Aporro Granz is a character in the manga and anime Bleach. He is the 8th Espada in Sosuke Aizen's Army of Arrancar. His Zanpakuto is called Fornicaras.",
    "description": "<h2>Appearance</h2><p>Szayel Appro Granz is the 8th ranked Espada in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42859\" href=\"/sosuke-aizen/4005-42859/\">Sosuke Aizen</a> 's army of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47805\" href=\"/arrancar/4060-47805/\">Arrancar</a> . He is a extremely smart, Planing his traps down to the finest little detail in order to capture specimens for his experiments. The remains of his Hollow mask make up the frame of his glasses.</p><h2>Past</h2><p>Szayel seemed to work from the shadows. He was an Espada that lost his status among the originals. Szayel was a key factor to aiding Nnorita in the exile of Neliel. He used his research to develop a device to create a false image of Nnorita that threw Neliel off-guard. He was also the one that ripped off the masks of Neliel's Fraccion Pesche and Dondochakka. Over time he would gradually regain his status as an Espada.</p><h2>Hueco Mundo Arc</h2><p>Szayel defies Aizen's orders to stay put while Ichigo and friends roamed free. He dispatched the Exequias handle the trespassers. Aizen excused his actions as Szayel claimed his actions in goodwill in eliminating a likely threat. He would ultimately decide to face Renji and Ishida in a room of his design. The pair manage to deal significant damage to the Espada. Fortunately Szayel took getting hurt into his analysis and developed means for instant regeneration. Renji and Ishida were basically helpless as Szayel transformed in his released state.</p><p>Szayel engages Renji Abarai and Uryu Ishida in battle, during the course of which he nullifies each of their abilities and damages them enough to be in a non-combative state. Just as he loses interest in them and is about to finish them off, Mayuri Kurotsuchi arrives to help them. Being of equal scientific and analytical ability as Szayel, Mayuri is able to render all of Szayel's abilities useless. Following his next death at the hands of Mayuri Kurotsuchi, Szayel reconstituted himself inside the womb of Nemu Kurotsuchi and was puked up in the same released form he had died in albeit with Nemu's genes added to the mix now.</p><p>But what he did not realize is that using her body to reproduce a clone of his original he had inadvertently inherited the various poisons within Nemu's bloodstream, which had been placed there in the event of something like this happening, including the \"Super-Human\" poison, which enhances every aspect of a single being to the point where one second seems like one century to him.</p><p>With his physical body unable to compensate for his over-enhanced state, Szayel ended up effectively paralyzed. Mayuri stabbed him through his hand and heart and broke the blade off, leaving Szayel to suffer for what seems as an eternity to him, while begging for a quick death.</p><h2>Hell-verse</h2><p>Quickly following his death at the hands of Mayuri Kurotsuchi, Szayel found himself in the Hell-verse or \"Hell\" as it is more commonly referred to alongside fellow Espada Aaroniero Arruruerie. Szayel, who was somewhat disappointed that Aaroniero's tank didn't crack, began egging him on and eventually provoked a violent response from Aaroniero who pulled out his Glotenira and was preparing to consume Szayel when the pink-haired Espada asked him why he was going to ignore the question he had posed earlier concerning where they were.</p><p>Szayel then offered an alternative solution: to stop trying to kill one another and figure out where they are together. Aaroniero didn't buy it and got into an argument concerning that just because Szayel had once been the Octava he was more powerful than Aaroniero who had been the Nouveno. Aaroniero rebutted by saying that Szayel's power was only greater when he was in his laboratory deep within Las Noches, then, just seconds before their fight could truly begin, a prisoner named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74616\" href=\"/shuren/4005-74616/\">Shuren</a> appeared and told them where they were and what their current situation was.</p><p>After thanking Shuren for jogging his memory, Szayel attacked him in an attempt to learn of a way out of the Hell-verse, which Shuren replied there was none. Shuren then explained that in order to survive the Hell-verse both he and Aaroniero would have to listen to him. It was then that Shuren's subordinates Taikon, Gunjou and Garogai appeared, all of them hideous and monstrously power human-like beings. Shuren then demanded that the three instruct their \"guests\" on how to be satisfied with their current situation. From behind Szayel, a furious post-release Aaroniero appeared and attempted to devour the eerily smiling and incredibly overweight Taikon only to be obliterated by his spiritual pressure in the process.</p><p>With everyone distracted, Szayel released his Zanpakutou and attempted to perform a Gran Rey Cero on Shuren only to be destroyed by his own power when Shuren's reiatsu caused the Cero to detonate in Szayel's hands, obliterating him in the process as well.</p><h2>Spirits are Forever with You</h2><p>During the course of the novel <em>Spirits are Forever with You</em>, a clone of Szayel known as Cien Grantz appears and battles the shinigamis of the Soul Society. He's revealed to be the 100th Arrancar convinced to be the the real Espada, but he later learns the truth of his origins by Mayuri. This form of the character possesses a Segunda Etapa and the 100 tatoo under his left eye-ball. The novel takes place in the timeskip between the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56251\" href=\"/arrancar-saga/4045-56251/\">Arrancar Saga</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56797\" href=\"/tale-of-the-lost-agent/4045-56797/\">Tale of the Lost Agent</a> , but its canonicity (as well as Cien) is debated.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Szayel has a several of methods of analyzing his opponent's abilities, such as studying the damage they cause to their past opponents. Once he has enough information on his opponents skills, Szayel can nullify their abilities, making him almost immune to their attacks.</p><p>In addition to the immunities gained from studying his opponents, Szayel created his own Fracción, his personal entourage of Arrancar. He has personally modified each of them so that when he needs to, he can heal any of his wounds by eating one of them.</p><h3>Zanpakutou</h3><p>Szayel's Zanpakutou is Fornicaras. Szayel releases his Zanpakuto by swallowing it. His body then swells up to enormous proportions and then explodes, revealing Szayel's released form. In his released form, Szayel has a pair of wing-shaped appendages from his back while his lower body transforms into a flock of long tentacles. Blood looking liquid drips from his clothes and fingertips. In Szayel's released state, When droplets of the liquid dripping from his body touch an opponent, a copy of them is created that uses their own abilities against them.</p><p>By wrapping an opponent in his wing like appendages, Szayel can create voodoo dolls of them. Any damage done to the dolls' internal organs is done to the original. His final ability, called \"Gabriel\", allows him to be reborn if he is injured beyond repair by impregnating an enemy. He then eats his way out of their body, killing them in the process.</p>",

She was mute because of torment, and was beat up constantly by her captor. But one day a Claymore named <a href=\"/teresa/4005-55901/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55901\">Teresa</a> sensed his yoki and killed him. The next day Clare started to follow Teresa. Teresa didn't take kindly to Clare even resorting to kicking her because she grabbed her cape. Later Clare was still following Teresa even for days without food or sleep. She eventually caught up when Teresa was resting. But Teresa knew she was there and tried to scare her off but still had no affect. Later a couple of thieves came by to rob Teresa and tried to grab Clare but she cut of his arm. Eventually the rest of the band found out what she was and left her alone by order of their boss. Clare still continued to follow Teresa even jumping off a cliff to keep up with her.</p><p>Passed out from the impact of the fall Teresa fells sorry for her and takes her with her and feeds her, eventually she gave her a name. Later the thief Teresa injured came back and tried to rape her but Clare came by and tried to protect her but to no avail it only made the thief go after her until Teresa stopped him. Later Clare finally speaks asking if she was hurt, and saying was she followed her. She even tells Teresa says she is always in pain and that she had the same eyes she did. Finally learning why Clare followed Teresa started to open up towards Clare. Eventually Teresa buys Clare new clothes and tries to give her to a family. But refuses to stay until Teresa convinces her how unsafe it is to be with her and that she will visit her. Eventually the Theives they met earlier come to the village Clare is at and kills most of the people.</p><p>After figuring out why the thieves were in the area Teresa came back and found Clare Unconscious and being dragged by the thief that tried to rape her. In a furious rage Teresa killed the thiefs and breaking the rule Claymores live by ''to not kill humans only Yoma's''. She is eventually ordered to be executed but escapes with Clare. The orginization sends a team to kill her but to no avail are able to beat her until one of the members sent to kill her named Priscilla goes berserk. Until gaining control of herself asks Teresa to kill her. But she lied and cut off her hands and eventually her head. Then Priscilla awakened and Killed the rest of the group only sparring Clare. Clare upset grabbed Teresa head and went looking for a member of the Orginization asking to put Teresa's blood in her thus turning Clare into a Claymore.</p><h3><strong><u>Life as a Claymore</u></strong></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19151/406439-49347-clare.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406439\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19151/406439-49347-clare.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406439\"><img alt=\"Clare Claymore #47\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19151/406439-49347-clare.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19151/406439-49347-clare.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Clare Claymore #47</figcaption></figure><p>One day Clare is sent on a mission to exterminate a Yoma in a village.

But learning that Claymores were forbiden to enter the city she had to hide her appearance and sneak into city. She then met the client and learned the yoma was killing and eating priests in the church, she was thinking the yoma was posing as a priest and told him she will kill it later. She then asked the priest if he could take care of Raki for her. Later that night she went to the church to find the yoma but was being blocked by two warriors named Galk, and Cid. Seeing she was a Claymore they thought she was responsible for the killings in the church. So after a scuffle Clare heard someone being attacked in the church. Racing there see encounters the Yoma which has just finished off a knight, started to attack it. It was too strong for her to battle without her sword as she had only two knives. Galk and Cid arrived to save her. But it overpowered them too. Galk was about to be killed but Clare took the blow instead of him. Calling for help soldiers come marching in and Yoma retreats deeper into the Church. The next day Clare was recoperating from her wound Raki met with the priest and two knights. Raki also learned that Clare asked the preist to watch him for her. Later that night Clare was healed up and began an investigation on the priests still alive. After inspecting each one of them she found out that were all human meaning it was somewhere else. Raki was waiting for Clare in the basement, Looking at one of the mummy's he saw a day ago inspects then tunrs around to look else where. A few seconds later the mummy starts to crawl out of it casket and starts to regain his form. Seeing that the yoma was disguised as a mummy it started to attack Raki. Clare then arrives to save Raki but is still weak from her injury tries to attack the yoma. Eventually Galk and Cid come to help her. Raki feeling useless goes to the statue he has been carrying and throws it to Clare which reveals to be her sword. With her sword back Clare is able to finish off the Yoma but by doing so uses to much aura and starts to awaken. Clare then asks Galk to kill her and says sorry to Raki. Raki then hugs Clare and says he can't live without her so I die with you. Clare hearing this regains control of her body mysteriously. The next day Clare and Raki prepare to leave and say goodby to Galk and Cid. Cid then comes up and gives Clare a goodby kiss. Seeing this Raki kicks him and starts to argue again with each other seeing that Clare smiles.</p><h3><u>The Slashers</u></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886364-2g4xa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2886364\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5934065934066\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886364-2g4xa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2886364\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" data-width=\"602\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886364-2g4xa.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886364-2g4xa.jpg 728w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886364-2g4xa.jpg 602w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886364-2g4xa.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886364-2g4xa.jpg 728w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886364-2g4xa.jpg 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" data-width=\"602\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Rubel then comes and tell Clare about her mission and says that yoma was not a Voracious Eater that is just a normal yoma.

Raki asks her why they were treating her horible she then tells him the Claymore ranks, and that she is the lowest one # 47. She tells Raki he can't come with her as it would be dangerous, and promises him she will be back. The team then sets off for the mountains. Later they take rest in a cave from the rain. Still teasing Clare because of her rank. Clare tries to fight back but Miria challenges her to test her strength. Eventually losing to Miria, Clare lays in the rain. The next morning they head off further into the mountains they then encounter a traveller who then tells them about the yoma only to find out he was the yoma. After trying to kill it they find out it was a awakened being. The Awakened one knocked out Clare while the others were trying to kill only to have it heal itself fast. It eventually incapacitated Helen, and Deneve. Miria was the only one active to kill it but it began to be to mcuh for her. Clare finally woke up and started to approach it. The awakened one was surprised how brave she was to come in front of it. When it attacked Clare doged it and was able to hit him. Miria then figured out Clare was reading its yoki and found out were it limbs were going to hit next. After figuring out it tricks Clare and Miria finished off. After the battle they checked on Helen and Deneve to see if they were alive. After talking about their battle Miria told them about the Organizations conspiracy. They all found out they were given this mission because they all were close to awakening. A few miles away a Claymore Galatea and Ermita were observing them from a far, and reading their emotions. Deneve then showed them how fast she could heal without awakening. Ermita then told Galatea to leave after hearing of what Deneve was doing. Deneve recovered her injury on her arm. Miria then told her she was folish for doing that. After Galatea left Clare sensed her movements and Galatea then sensed her. After their conversation Miria showed them the symbols of the top five Claymores and told them they are very loyal to the orginization, and warned them of Claymore #4. After that Clare left to met up with Raki.</p><h3><strong><u>Separation</u></strong></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886548-430_34_mpczw_claymore_v07_025__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2886548\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5196451204056\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886548-430_34_mpczw_claymore_v07_025__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2886548\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px\" data-width=\"631\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886548-430_34_mpczw_claymore_v07_025__1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886548-430_34_mpczw_claymore_v07_025__1_.jpg 789w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886548-430_34_mpczw_claymore_v07_025__1_.jpg 631w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886548-430_34_mpczw_claymore_v07_025__1_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886548-430_34_mpczw_claymore_v07_025__1_.jpg 789w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886548-430_34_mpczw_claymore_v07_025__1_.jpg 631w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px\" data-width=\"631\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Clare was then given another mission to kill another Awakened one. She and Raki strated off for the location. She was to be teamed up with a Claymore. When she arrived she met her fellow teamate and was attacked by her. After seeing her ally attack her she tought of Miria's words about Claymore No. 3. She was looking for her symbol to prove her wrong only to find out it was true. The Claymore saw what she was looking at and asked where did she here about her from. The Claymore then revealed her name to be <a href=\"/ophelia/4005-55543/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55543\">Ophelia</a>. Raki then tried to help only to be a plaything for Ophelia. She then sliced off Clare's legs and went to torture Raki. Ophelia then decided to play a game with Raki after striked her shen then began to put more force in her slashes. After a few minutes of torture a little girl apperaed of of nowhere. Raki then warned her about Ophelia only to see that see is a awakened one. Clare then rushed to reatach her legs and help raki but the awakened one layed waist to the buildings. Clare was succesful in getting Raki out of the way only to have Ophelia trick her into helping her and throwing Raki to the awakened one. Clare was beaing held down by Ophelia to prevent her from saving Raki after finally braking free Clare rescued Raki and hurried out of the village to keep Ophelia from Raki. Ophelia was then left to deal with the Awakened one and finsihed it off. After escaping and getting far from Ophelia she told Raki to leave. Raki was hesitant to leave Clare alone but she kissed him and told him \"I promise you... I won't die. I'll live...and I'll find you\". Raki then left and Clare headed in another direction to lure Ophelia the other direction. Ophelia then caught and began to fight with Clare again. Clare proved to be no match for Ophelia so she began to ry and read her aura only to see she is too fast. Clare then tried to give her a sneak attack but got her arm cut off in the process. Rushing to get away Clare was hurrying to reatach her arm only to have Ophelia catch up again. Ophelia then told her that due to her rank she is to weak to reatach her arm or grow antoher. So then she sliced Clares arm into pieces to prevent her from healing it. Clare then tried to defend her self only this time to get her hand cut off. Ophelia was about to finish her off until a old Claymore named <a href=\"/irene/4005-55905/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55905\">Irene</a> came and saved Clare.</p><h3><strong><u>Training</u></strong></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886368-mis7h.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2886368\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5412087912088\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886368-mis7h.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2886368\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" data-width=\"622\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886368-mis7h.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886368-mis7h.jpg 728w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886368-mis7h.jpg 622w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886368-mis7h.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886368-mis7h.jpg 728w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886368-mis7h.jpg 622w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" data-width=\"622\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After passing out from her ordeal Clare awoke in a bed and was bandaged up and her hand was reattached. Irene then came in to bring her food. Clare asked how long she was a sleep Irene then told her to rest and get energy. Clare refused and said she had to go. Irene then came behind and shoved her head into the bed and told her \"If you value your life so little then I will be happy to kill you right here\". She told her Ophelia is still alive and is looking for her. After their conversation Irene told her to think about her situation. Irene went outside and used her sword to see if she could preform her Quick Sword. Clare then came outside and Irene was suprise to know that Clare was the child traveling with Teresa many years ago. Clare then asked if she encoutered Priscilla. Irene asked is she thinking of going after her and showed her what Priscilla did to her. Clare was shocked to see Irene was missing her left arm. Irene then told her she went into hiding and was not using her yoki so she would not be found by the orginization. Irene then gives back her sword and tells her she will teach her the Quick Sword. Clare proved to be succesful in learning the Quick Sword but was going to need more time and training. After her training Clare went to bath and was given a new uniform. Irene then told her it was her's. Clare then asked if Teresa's death was her fault. Irene tells her It's true in one sense due to her traveling with her strength declined. She contuined to tell she could have finished off Priscilla then and there but she hesitated and due to her heart losing her toughness. Irene then told her in all her time she always showed her cryptic smile but with Clare she was more peaceful. Hearing this Clare broke down in tears. Irene then told Clare \"to live you staying alive is the only proof that Teresa existed\". The next day Clare was still long away from learning the Qucik sword so Irene cut of her shoulder and then cut of her left arm and gave it to Clare. Clare was shocked and Irene told her it's a parting gift. She then told her she will start regenrating a new arm only to lie to her. So Clare attached her new arm, and told her she will return it to her. After Clare left Irene a Claymore named Rafaela came to kill her due to Irene leaving the orginization. While Clare was walking she sensed a huge amount of Yoki and encountered Ophelia again only this time she awakened. Clare found out she did not know she awakened and began to attack Clare. Ophelia thru Clare into a lake and was holding her down in the lake. Then she realised she awakened and blame it on Clare. Clare was able to cut off Ophelia arms until her new arm started to reject her. Ophelia then realised what was going on and sent her reaming human parts to the end of her tail and challenged Clare to finish her off before she heals or Clare awakens. Hearing this Clare used the Quick Sword and made her way through Ophelia's body only to start slowing down Ophelia then called to her and she came back into her senses. Clare finally reached Ophelia's remaing body and she was hesitant to finish her off, but Ophelia told her it was alright. FInally freeing Ophelia from her anguish Clare then started on her quest to look for Raki.</p><h3><u>The WItches Maw</u></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886536-430_48_emsee_claymore_09_071.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2886536\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.6\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:160.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886536-430_48_emsee_claymore_09_071.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2886536\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-width=\"600\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886536-430_48_emsee_claymore_09_071.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886536-430_48_emsee_claymore_09_071.jpg 750w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886536-430_48_emsee_claymore_09_071.jpg 600w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886536-430_48_emsee_claymore_09_071.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2886536-430_48_emsee_claymore_09_071.jpg 750w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2886536-430_48_emsee_claymore_09_071.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-width=\"600\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Clare went to the town of Hanel after killing Ophelia, disguised as a man. There she came across Rakel, a severely wounded Claymore. Rakel told Clare of how her team leader Jean and two other Claymore have been captured and tortured, begging Clare to go and save them. Clare promises to do so just as Rakel dies. She headed to the cave and easily fought off a large collection of Yoma. After killing them all, she entered the Witch's Maw and was attacked by Dauf, an Awakened Being. She fought with Dauf, while trying to get past him to save Jean. However, she could not beat Dauf. It is then that Galatea appeared. Originally sent to retrieve Clare, Galatea agreed to help after being trapped in the cave. Galatea held off Dauf while Clare went to save Jean. When she reaches the chamber, one of Jean's companions was dead, while Jean had almost awakened. She was shocked to discover that Jean still kept her mind after her body transformed. Attempting to imitate Galatea's Yoki Manipulation, she managed to pull Jean back to her human form, though saying that she was not very good at it and probably could not do it again. Jean pledged her life to Clare before the two returned to help Galatea. Together, the three Claymore managed to defeat Dauf but could not kill him when Riful, the Abyssal one of the West, interfered. Riful rewarded Clare's efforts by telling her where Priscilla is, before leaving with Dauf. Galatea allowed Clare to continue her journey, while Clare and Jean left to continue the search for Raki. Clare objected to Jean stubbornly following her, saying that the debt was already repaid since Jean's example of extreme willpower made her Quicksword even better. She had to abandon her search for Raki when Rafaela and Rubel managed to catch them. She learned that Raki had been captured by a slave-trader and reluctantly accepts her orders to go to the North.</p><h3><strong><u>The Northern Campaign</u></strong></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-435806\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.3900293255132\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-435806\"><img alt=\"Clare beginning to awaken\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-width=\"690\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg 1364w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg 690w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Clare beginning to awaken\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg 1364w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19859/435806-clare_picture_11.jpg 690w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-width=\"690\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Clare beginning to awaken</figcaption></figure><p>Clare was one of the 24 Claymore chosen to fight in the Northern Campaign. She was put into Flora's team by Miria, along with Lily (#18 , Wendy (#30 and Karla (#39 . During the first battle, Clare helped Flora kill an Awakened Being, changing Flora's perception of her power. After the first battle, Flora challenged Clare to a fight in order to determine whose attack was quicker ; Flora's Windcutter attack or Clare's Quick Sword. In the end, it was determined Clare's attack is quicker, though less accurate. Flora passed the title of \"Fastest Sword amongst the Claymores\" onto Clare. During the second battle, Rigardo managed to critically wound Jean, causing Clare to forget her orders to protect Flora. Due to this, Flora was cut in half by Rigardo. Enraged over the death of her friends, Clare managed to awaken parts of her body without losing her human mind. After managing to control these parts of her body, she manages to kill Rigardo, however, she ran into trouble reverting back to normal. She asked Helen to kill her at first, before the critically wounded Jean sacrificed herself to save Clare, fulfilling her vow to serve Clare for the rest of her life. This successfully allowed Clare to change back, though she was distraught at Jean's death. She is one of the seven survivors along with Miria, Helen, Deneve, Cynthia, Tabitha and Yuma.

She learned to repress her aura completely during the seven years she was there. She also learned the Windcutter move since using her Quicksword used too much Yoki to be used without being tracked down. After saving Clarice, Nina and their team from Awakened Beings, she travels to a town with Yuma and finds a slave trade prison. She finds clues of Raki being there and having escaped which gives her new hope that he is alive. She requests that she travels south and fights Miria to settle it. In the end, all of the survivors travel south. After travelling away from the North, she, Miria, Helen and Deneve rescue the four soldiers that had ran into Riful of the West. Clare remains behind after the other three escaped. By saying that she'd 'consider' joining Riful, Clare questions her about the status of the Abyssal Ones. After finding out all the information she needs, she makes her escape. After learning that Galatea and Rafaela are no longer a part of the Organization, she accompanied the other six South. While passing Rabona, they sensed the aure of an awakened being. Once they entered the city they ran into Galatea and helped her by defeating Agatha. Clare was the first one to reveal herself and used <strong>Windcutter</strong> and <strong>Quicksword</strong> effectively to defeat Agatha. Afterwards, she learns from Sid that Raki passed through the city with a girl. She, Yuma and Cynthia leave Rabona together to find Raki. After leaving Rabona, she and the other two decide to investigate a town where three Claymores and apparently two members of the organization had gathered. They were sent to kill an awakened being but it proved too strong for them. Clare and the others knocked them out so they wouldn't reveal them to the rest of the orginization. Clare effectively defeated the Awakened One that was hiding there but, in revealing herself, she ran into Rubel.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2081006-clare47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081006\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56818181818182\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2081006-clare47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081006\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2081006-clare47.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2081006-clare47.jpg 704w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2081006-clare47.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2081006-clare47.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2081006-clare47.jpg 704w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2081006-clare47.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Like all Claymores Clare possess strength, speed, and reflexes far greater than that of any human:Clare has been able to slash the water 40 times while seemingly not moving,she has been able to fight faster then the humans eye could and even Claymores. She has been able to rip the cell door off a holding cell and has been able to toss her very heavy Blade meters in the air,also she has left huge craters behind the impact of her blade. She also possess vast regenerative capabilities and resilience, allowing her to survive normally-fatal injuries such as evisceration and limb loss. When she uses abilities her eyes usually turns from silver to gold. Clare also has the ability to sense yoki due to having Teresa's flesh put in her. Due to her weak rank see was not strong until she lost her arm when battling Ophelia, and gained Irene's arm. But she learned how to us Irene's Quicksword ability. She eventually learned how to awaken different parts of her body when she was battling Rigardo. But she lost control and started to awaken. Jean then helped her regain her senses and form by sacrificing her life to restore Clare.</p><ul><li>Clare was the only Claymore in history to have fought uising partially awakened limbs. In this form, she gains incredible speed and enhanced striking ability, amplifying her strike capability. This partially awakened form was enough to hold its own against Priscilla,  a being that exceeds even the Awakened beings. She was on the verge of complete awakening when one of her comrades sacrificed herself to pull back Clare. Since then, she has been seen unable to even partially awaken. Jean had created a mental block in Clare to prevent the process. </li><li>Clare is regarded as weak by Claymore standards, but is actually specifically trained to fight yoma and awakened beings. She has displayed this ability by being able to read the yoma presense of average awakened beings and reacting to avoid critical strikes while her fellow warriors in the double and single digits were unable to react and do the same. </li><li>Quicksword: This technique has easily become one of Clares signature attack styles. The form was invented and used Quicksword Irene, and works by rapidly awakening and releasing all Yoki in the sword arm and rapidly vibrating to give rise to the sword technique. The awakening is not permanent. Clare however was finding it difficult to utilize the technique due to the berserking nature of her Youki. As a parting gift, Irene cuts off one of her arm for clare to use, as Clare had previously lost one in combat. </li><li>Windcutter: A technique similar to quicksword but slower. Clare quickly subtitutes to using this technique as it required less use of Youki as more use of Youki pushes a warrior to awakening.</li><li>The seven year time skip sees Clare and the others gaining an ability to completely supress Youki while having the ability to sense them. Their ability gets enhanced enough for them to sense Youki from miles away. This is also what helped the \"Seven Ghosts\" as they were known, to stay hidden for so long. </li><li>Claymore: This standard weapon for the warriors has never been damaged, rusted or broken due to age or in a conflict with the Awakened beings. It is believed this unbreakable and indestructible alloy comes from the mainland where a war wages between Dragons and humans. Not even beings the level of Priscilla has been seen capable of breaking one of these swords known as Claymore. </li></ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Backstory</h2><p>Raki's family was killed by a yoma, and later killed his brother Zaki and took on his form to eat and kill more people in their town. The town eventually called for a CLaymore to exterminate the yoma. Raki then met the Claymore named Clare. He followed and asked her questions and eventually took a liking towards her. Later that night he found out the horible truth that his brother has been dead and a yoma was posing as him. It then tried to kill him until Clare came in and killed it. Raki in shock Clare left him alone and left. Eventually Raki left his village to find Clare. He found himself in a sandstorm where he past out from the heat. Later he awakes and is in a hotel. He leaves to the front desk finding out a Claymore saved him and brought him to the hotel. Going to look for the Claymore thinking it's Clare he finds another Claymore. She tells him she rescued him from the desert and asks if he is okay. He later figures it out that she is not a real Claymore due to her calling her self one (Claymores don't called themselves by the name from which he learned from Clare). With it act discovered the yoma resorts to killing Raki until Clare arrives and kills the yoma. Wondering why he was there he tells her what happened and asks to go with Clare. Thinking it sounds unsafe Clare asks if he can cook, and he replys gladly.</p><h2><strong>Travelling With Clare</strong></h2><p>Raki Officially, became Clare's 'Cook' (even though she barely eats). He goes with Clare to the holy city of Rabona disguised as Clare's little brother so she could do her job without being suspicios. At Rabona Raki carried a statue that had within it her Claymore.

    "description": "<h2> History</h2> <p>Nanao is notable for being in  8th Division when she was a little girl, and enjoyed being read to by former lieutenant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54803\" href=\"/lisa-yadomaru/4005-54803/\" slug=\"lisa-yadomaru\">           Lisa Yadōmaru</a>, something they did regularly each month around the time of the first. Eventually between the period when Lisa was forced to hide alongside the other transformed <a data-ref-id=\"4060-46640\" href=\"/vizards/4060-46640/\" slug=\"vizards\">           Vizards</a><a data-ref-id=\"4060-46640\" href=\"/vizards/4060-46640/\" slug=\"vizards\"> </a>and the present day, she worked her way up from being Shunsui's subordinate to his lieutenant.</p><h2> Soul Society Arc  </h2><p>Nanao is first seen when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43020\" href=\"/yasutora-sado/4005-43020/\" slug=\"yasutora-sado\">        Yasutora Sado</a> makes his way to the  Eighth Division’s offices. She was talking to<a data-ref-id=\"4005-54541\" href=\"/shunsui/4005-54541/\" slug=\"shunsui\"> </a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-54541\" href=\"/shunsui/4005-54541/\" slug=\"shunsui\">        Shunsui Kyōraku</a>, who was teasing her, calling her “Nanao-chan!” (\"Little Nanao!\" in the English Dub) which she hate s. She later spreads flower petals so that Kyōraku can make his grand entrance. But as usual he starts teasing her and she gets mad at him and dumps the rest on him. During the fight between Kyōraku and Chad she stays out of the picture, and then receives a message from the    Onmitsukidō, informing her of the murder of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42859\" href=\"/sosuke-aizen/4005-42859/\" slug=\"sosuke-aizen\">        Sōsuke Aizen</a>. She runs to Kyōraku to tell him, and then as they turn to leave, she notices that Chad, who has been cut by Kyōraku, is not dead. She asks permission to deliver the finishing blow, but Kyōraku says no and instead tells her to take him to the    Fourth Division <u>.</u> </p> <p>Much later, during the day of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46355\" href=\"/rukia-kuchiki/4005-46355/\" slug=\"rukia-kuchiki\">        Rukia Kuchiki</a>'s execution, she finds Kyōraku at his usual spot up on a roof. She puts up once again with his teasing as she tries to hurry him to the Sōkyoku Stand. As he asks her what he should do, she tells him that no matter what she thinks or advises, he would still do what he wanted to. “Don’t worry,” she also said, “I will stay several steps behind you, so as not to get caught in trouble, but I will follow.” After the failed execution, Nanao follows Kyōraku and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47122\" href=\"/jushiro-ukitake/4005-47122/\" slug=\"jushiro-ukitake\">        Jūshirō Ukitake</a> to the place where they could battle Yamamoto without getting anyone else implicated. She then describes the spiritual pressure that is Yamamoto, but while trying to take out her Zanpakutō, she is caught in Yamamoto’s stare and is suffocated by his spiritual pressure. Kyōraku breaks the eye contact to save her, and brings her to a safer spot. She then realizes that it is not only difficult to win against Yamamoto even with two Captain's on their side, but it is next to impossible <br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Appearance</h2>Nanao is a youthful girl with black hair normally kept pinned back, she has blue eyes and wears glasses. She notably resembles <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54803\" href=\"/lisa-yadomaru/4005-54803/\" slug=\"lisa-yadomaru\">Lisa Yadōmaru</a>, a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-46640\" href=\"/vizards/4060-46640/\" slug=\"vizards\">Visoreds</a> and the person who preceded her position as the 8th Division Lieutenant. The resemblance is likely intentional on her part, as she is hinted to have greatly respected Lisa before she became a Visored, when Nanao was a child first joining the Gotei 13.<p><b>Real Name: </b>Nanao Ise<br/><b>Birthday:</b> July 7<br/><b>Height: </b>5'4\"<br/><b>Weight: </b>106 lbs <br/><b>Rank: </b> Lieutenant of the 8th Division, Vice-President of the Shinigami Women's Association</p>",

He takes great pride in his experiments and the things he has created (such as his daughter <a href=\"/nemu-kurotsuchi/4005-55539/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55539\"> Nemu</a>) and condemns the concept of perfection. He has made extensive modifications to his body: his left arm can extend like a grappling hook, form a scythe by pulling out his ‘ears’, and even replacing his organs with dummies. Mayuri has little regard for life or allegiances, readily turning his own subordinates into human bombs on one occasion. </p><p> </p><p>Due to their opposing views on life, as well as multiple other factors, Kurotsuchi is often considered Uryu Ishida’s nemesis. In the past, the potential danger he posed to Soul Society led to his imprisonment when he joined the <a href=\"/soul-reapers/4060-42599/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42599\"> Soul Reapers</a>; it is noteworthy that, in the prison he was held in, he was the only one considered dangerous enough to warrant a separate cell from other prisoners as well as restraints. Kisuke Urahara, upon becoming captain of the 12th Division, recognized his potential as a scientist and released Mayuri to help him with his research and to assist him in running his newly-started Shinigami Research Institute. In return, Urahara promised him the Division and position as President of the Research Institute if anything were to happen to him. To a certain degree, Kurotsuchi holds a grudging respect for Urahara and his skills. </p><h2>Appearance</h2><h3> </h3><p> </p><p>Mayuri's appearance looks kind of like a skull, this is because he wears make-up every day. His fingernails are blue and, with the exception of the fingernail on his right middle finger, are all short. Mayuri is revealed to have blue hair and golden brown eyes when without make-up. He also wore a white hat with two ends that point to his right and a large purple scarf around his neck. His painted his whole body, even his face and hands, has been painted black and white. It has been shown that he has to repaint it every morning because he takes it off before he goes to bed.</p><p>Mayuri's looks have changed since his initial appearance: his ear attachments have become shorter and rounder, his chin has a longer attachment which makes look like an Egyptian pharaoh , his teeth have become a golden color, and he doesn't wear a hat anymore. His hair is also styled into \"horns,\" which when viewed from the front looks much like a Pharaoh's crown, and his face paint has been painted differently with two black stripes running down his face. He still doesn't state why he changed all of this but it is probably based off of his won preference.</p><p> </p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Mayuri Kurotsuchi is a researcher and makes himself seem like a mad scientist. By his early actions during the Ryoka Invasion, he is displayed as one of the most sadistic and cruel Shinigami. He sees everyone and everything not as a living being, but as an object to be researched—including himself.He has little respect or regard for most others, and was even willing to turn his own men (who were not aware of his plans) into living bombs in an attempt to capture Uryu and <u>Orihime</u><a href=\"http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Orihime_Inoue\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> for experimentation <u>. </u>He also withheld vital information about the bounts from the other Shinigami in order to capture one as a research subject for himself.</p><p>It is known that Mayuri's favorite food is pike fish, and that he does not like onion. One of his free-time activities is reading every character published in <i>Seiretei Communication</i>. He himself publishes a serialization in the journal, titled \"Effective Medication for the Brain\", which apparently contains detailed instructions on preparation of medicine and their application. Surprisingly, it is highly popular among the readers.</p><p>In battle, Mayuri likes to play with his opponent, torturing them little by little until they can hardly stand. This was shown in both the fight with Uryū and his Espada counterpart Szayel. Every time he fights he uses it as an experiment testing himself and his opponent little by little. He also uses it as an opportunity to implant microbes or other things in case they get away. Before engaging, though, he will make extensive research on his possible opponents to tilt the chance of winning to his side.It is seen that when he is busy reading in the library with a note on the door saying, \"Enter and Die.\"</p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><p>Little is known about the early history of Mayuri, except that 110 years ago he was the only prisoner in the Maggots Nest who was considered dangerous enough to necessitate confinement in a small prison cell, chained to the wall by his ankle. He would, however, one day be visited by Kisuke who was seeking his genius to become vice-president in the newly thought-of Shinigami research Institute , a request that would automatically get him out of there. At first Mayuri refused, until Kisuke began teasing him with the fact that he had nothing to tinker with down there and that, as vice-president, he would inherit everything should something happen to Urahara.</p><p>9 years later Mayuri was seen with Kisuke Urahara and Hiyori Sarugaki walking through the Seireitei when they were greeted by 5th division captain Shinji and his lieutenantAizen. Mayuri showed a distaste for Shinji as he refused to call Mayuri by his full name and only called him by his first, which was too familiar for Mayuri's liking. He seemingly was uninterested in the conversation between Urahara and Aizen who was explaining that the 9th Division had been sent on a special investigation to find out what was happening with the disappearances in the Rukongai.</p><p> </p><p> During her brief time as a member of the institute, Hiyori served as a lab manager, which resulted in clashes with Mayuri, who was then 3rd Seat &amp; Vice-President of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute, over who had more authority under the Captain. The two constantly got into an ongoing argument about whose in charge, prompting Hiyori to call in Urahara. He explained to her that with the disappearances occurring he had created a new type of Gigai. Before Hiyori could respond they were interrupted by the arrival of Todo , the 6th Seat of the 9th Division. Urahara agreed to send a researcher over to the investigation site as per the request of captain of the 9th Division. Urahara elected Hiyori to go to the site, to which she became irritated and asked why he couldn't send someone less important. He questioned if she should continue being a lieutenant prompting Hiyori to attack him, though he simply dodged her. Though reluctant Hiyori gave in once Urahara explained that she was the only one that he could trust with the task.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After an incident that got Urahara and Tessai banished and other captains such as Shinji and the current vizards hollowfied, Mayuri later succeeded Urahara in leading the Research and Development Institute as well becoming captain of the 12th Division of the Gotei 13 .</p><p>He also experimented on Quincy , including Soken Ichida , Uryū's master and grandfather, in his studies. He believed that upon Sōken Ishida's death the Quincy had been entirely wiped out, and was disappointed to learn that Uryū was a Quincy because he considered his study of the Quincy complete and did not want any further Quincy specimens.</p><h2>Soul Society Arc</h2><p> </p><p>Mayuri is present at a meeting of the Gotei 13 captains which is was called so that Captain Gin can explain his suspicious actions. Gin, being one of the thirteen captains, should have had no trouble destroying Ichigo and his friends. Gin merely chalks it up to a mistake on his part. Though Mayuri and Kenpachi argue over the possibility of Gin purposefully letting them go, which eventually becomes an argument between the two until they are silenced by Captain-Commander Yamamoto.</p><p>During the invasion of Soul Society, Mayuri attempts to search for the ryoka and use them as test subjects. During the search, Mayuri tries to interrogate Ikkaku while he is healing in the 4th dicision headquarters. Ikkaku refuses to tell him the details of his fight. Disturbed that Ikkaku has nothing to offer, he states that he will need to be punished for his behavior, though Mayuri is then stopped by Zaraki who asks him since when does he have authority over the members of other divisions. Mayuri quickly leaves.</p><p> </p><p>He eventually meets up with Uryu and Orihime , whom he tries to capture using his own squad members as bombs. After Mayuri blows up the last of his men, he sees Orihime's defensive <i> </i> technique that has protected her and Ishida from the blast. Ishida turns his sights on Mayuri, who is now interested in studying Orihime because of her shield, asking if she would like to be his research subject. Mayuri, not paying any attention Ishida, continues to add incentives to Orihime to become his subject by giving offers he normally wouldn't. Mayuri then notices Ishida standing next to him pointing a bow, and tells him that he is pretty fast for a Quincey . Mayuri then states that they are a rare breed and he hasn't seen one alive for many years, but he notes that he has no interest in the Quincy as he finished studying their kind some time ago. When this causes Ishida to question who he is, Mayuri is taken aback at the idea that Ishida and his friends would invade without doing their homework and at the very least they should know who the captains were. Mayuri then gives his name, rank and position, realizing what they are up against, Ishida tells Orihime to run for it as he takes on Mayuri. Not about to lose a test subject, Mayuri extends his arm to catch Orihime but it is shot off by one of Ishida's arrows.</p><p>Mayuri is disappointed at the state of his extension arm and detaches it from his body much to Ishida's surprise. He then takes out and uses a tube with a green substance which instantly regenerates his arm further surprising Ishida. He then goes on to say that it really doesn't matter if Orihime got away he can always track her down and the sooner he does the sooner he can begin testing. Ishida fires his spiritual arrows at him though Mayuri dodges the first couple of shots and then uses Shunpo to maneuver to a nearby roof. Mayuri makes note that Ishida has been using an advanced Quincy technique similar to Shunpo. Mayuri states that, though he can use Shunpo to counter the technique, it is tiresome to use and he can't have Ishida moving all over the place, thus he resolves to kill him. Mayuri then releases his Shikai and before Ishida can counter with a spirit arrow he is stopped by Mayuri's lieutenant Nemu who blocks him causing them both to be injured by Mayuri's attack. Mayuri is livid that Nemu had let go of Ishida after the attack, and hits her as she begs for forgiveness. </p><p> When Ishida protests at Mayuri's treatment of his own subordinate, Mayuri claims that she won't die from her injuries as he created her body himself and tells Ishida that she is a construct entirely of his making and therefore his \"daughter\". Mayuri then turns his attention back to Ishida so that he can finish him off. He then tells Ishida not to dare try and tell him how to treat her, but Ishida still screams out in protest only to realize that his arm is paralyzed. Mayuri proceeds to tell him what the special ability of his Zanpakutō is, and then stabs Ishida in his arm once again causing him to scream out in pain. Mayuri then tells Nemu to kill him but then realizes that she is paralyzed because of the attack as well and stomps on her again. Ishida screams that he should stop, prompting Mayuri to question whether his philosophy has to do with the <i>Quincy pride</i> that his people where always talking about before they died.</p><p>Ishida questions him on what he is talking about and Mayuri details how once he studied the Quincy (though his studies seemingly only included every horrible and cruel way possible, more akin to torture) and had ended his study years ago, he detailed that before dying they would always swear on the pride of the Quincy. Ishida listens on in absolute shock as he hears of the butchering of his people. Mayuri then offhandedly reveals that he was the one who orchestrated the death of Uryū's grandfather, Soken and even shows him a image of his grandfather.</p><p> </p><p>Ishida is enraged by the truth of his grandfather's death and swears to kill Mayuri on the pride of the Quincy. He then uses an advanced and rare Quincy technique which allows him to control his paralyzed body like a puppet. Mayuri notes that he had never actually seen the technique in any of the 2661 Quincy he studied and is surprised that someone so young can use it. Mayuri then takes out his hidden Kusarigama and resolves that since he is starting to find Ishida interesting, he will keep him alive to study as well. But much to Mayuri's surprise, Ishida removes his sanrei glove to gain the power to defeat the captain.</p><p> </p><p>Mayuri is utterly surprised as he has never seen this technique before and is unsure of what even happened. He then notices that Ishida is absorbing the surrounding structures, then deduces that since everything in Soul Society is made of spirit energy, he is absorbing them and turning them into strength. Mayuri then tells Ishida that he has gone far beyond the limits of Humans, but Ishida's only response is the creation of a complex bow construct with which he fires a spiritual arrow, which Mayuri dodges. To his surprise, Ishida appears from above and shoots him, causing a large explosion. Ishida offers to spare Mayuri if he apologizes to everyone and never appears in front of him again. He threatens to shoot him with a spiritual arrow three times stronger than the last shot if he does not. The previous arrow grievously injured Mayuri, having destroyed his left arm. Now enraged, he insults Ishida for his cockiness and declares that he could match his power, and releases his Bankai. Mayuri explains that the poison his Bankai releases would surely kill him, though Ishida states that his arrow will reach Mayuri long before his Bankai's fatal poison can be released. Mayuri sends his bankai creature charging at Ishida, who fires his arrow, splitting it in half and shooting a hole through Mayuri's stomach.Despite the fatal injuries, Mayuri still lives and much to Ishida's surprise, stabs himself in the throat with his Zanpakutō, allowing him to use its ability to turn himself into liquid so that he could escape, seeping into the cracks of the area.</p><p>Later, he hears of the announcement of Aizen's treachery after reforming, but upon being asked by Nemu he refuses to get involved, saying that he is not interested.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Zanpakuto</h2><p> </p><h3>Zanpakuto</h3><p>Ashisogi Jizō is the name of Mayuri's Zanpakuto, the hilt is pink and he has a modified hook on the front so it would hang off of his waist band. He is the only captain so far that wears his sword in front and not on the side. His sword has many different Abilities. </p><h3>Liquid Form</h3><p>When Mayuri stabs himself with the sword he instantly turns into a green slime which makes him unable to attack and nobody can attack him this is used when he is about to die. He also loses any body modifications that he had when he reforms. </p><h3>Shikai</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111241744/4731459-9516833509-50605.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4731459\" style=\"width: 337px\" data-ratio=\"0.74777448071217\" data-width=\"337\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111241744/4731459-9516833509-50605.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4731459\"><img alt=\"Ashisogi Jizō\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111241744/4731459-9516833509-50605.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111241744/4731459-9516833509-50605.jpg 337w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px\" data-width=\"337\"></a><figcaption>Ashisogi Jizō</figcaption></figure><p>The name of Mayuri's Shikai is Ashisogi Jizō. Mayuri's shikai is very unique since it has 3 spikes points and the guard looks like a baby's head with it's hands together in prayer. Two of the spikes are crooked while the middle blade is longer and a little straighter. The hilt has leaf like fragments that point out more then they did in it's sealed form. But it has one good abilities. One is when he stabs someone they become paralyzed within a few seconds but they can still feel pain. </p><p> </p><h3>Bankai</h3><p>The name of Mayuri's Bankai is Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō. His bankai does not actually change his sword but it manifests a huge monster caterpillar with a babies head. It has arms and a halo around its head. It has many different techniques that can kill the opponent the most used would be its poison breath which can cover a large area and is almost impossible to dodge and anyone who breathes would die in minutes. There is an antidote but only Mayuri, Nemu and the captain of squad 2 have it. Even if you don't breathe it can go through the pores in your skin. The only known way that has been shown to stop it was to blow it away with a strong reiatsu. If you get too close to Jizo it can produce numerous swords from its chest which can impale anyone too close. Since it is so big it can ram into people and kill them. It can also eat the enemy if it wants to. Also if Jizo ever attacked Mayuri it would self-destruct back into its sealed form. </p><h3>Abilites</h3><p>Since Mayuri is a captain he has great spiritual power. Also since he is the president of the Shinigami Research Institute he is very smart and tactical person. This is shown when it only took him an hour to figure out how the 8th espada abilities worked. He has made many modifications to his body such as an extending arm a scythe that comes from his ear, and being able to blend in with the environment. It has been stated that he is the most proficient with kido in the whole soul society. He is also descent in all other techniques such as flash step and swordsmanship. This does make him one of the weaker captains but his intelligence and preparedness makes up for it during battle.</p>",

While in the forest, she regressed into a child-like state, remembering her brother and the One-Horned Monster that ate him. Her anger over his death, coupled with the severity of her wounds, caused her to awaken. While wandering through the forest, Ophelia met Clare once again. Ophelia was initially unaware of her own awakened state and attacked Clare, looking to eat her. The battle eventually led to a lake, where upon seeing her own reflection in the water, began lamenting her current state. Taking advantage of her momentary weakness, Clare destroyed both of her arms.</p><p>Ophelia and Clare continued battling, with Clare gaining the upper hand, due to Ilena's borrowed right arm. However, Ophelia knew that Clare was reaching her limit and that her borrowed arm was from Ilena. She also knew that Clare could not control the arm's power and would lose as a result. But in a twist of fate, knowing that she could not get revenge against the One-Horned Monster in her current state, Ophelia allowed Clare to kill her. Before dying she entrusted her will to Clare.</p><h3>The Phantom and the Wicked Warrior</h3><p>(Note: This takes place prior to her other appearances.)</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3063985\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5206043956044\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3063985\"><img alt=\"Face of a monster\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg 728w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg 420w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Face of a monster\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg 728w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3063985-3011105-9695833851-gclay.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Face of a monster</figcaption></figure><p>Ophelia is seen with the handler Ermita, overseeing a yoma hunt, involving <a href=\"/miria/4005-55912/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55912\">Miria</a>. They were speaking about Miria's phantom technique and her promotion to No. 8, when Ermita asked why Ophelia was not participating in the fight, despite being leader of the yoma hunt. She replied that she was only interested in hunting Awakened Beings and that these yoma could easily be handled by the group without her. She then left into the forest after sensing a presence.</p><p>She later appeared leading an awakened hunt, with Miria in company. While they were walking to the target area, she told Miria a story about meeting a warrior in the woods, who was reaching her limit. The warrior gave Ophelia her black card, so she could give to a handler. Instead, Ophelia, disgusted by the warrior's weakness, ripped apart the black card, condemning the warrior to awaken.</p><p>Before Miria could make sense of the story, the Awakened Being attacked. Ophelia defeated the creature single handily. Only afterwards did Miria realize it was her old friend Hilda. Overcame with grief, she began to awaken. Excited by the notion of fighting Miria as an Awakened Being, Ophelia did nothing to stop this. However, Miria managed to stop the transformation, much to Ophelia's dismay.</p><h2>Personality</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3012656\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5631868131868\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3012656\"><img alt=\"Not so nice lady\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" data-width=\"409\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg 614w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg 409w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Not so nice lady\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg 614w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3012656-7727514347-Claym.jpg 409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" data-width=\"409\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Not so nice lady</figcaption></figure><p><strong>\"</strong>At that time. I noticed a lone warrior coming up to me. Her breathing was faint. She was approaching her limit as a warrior, a condition in which she could awaken any time. She handed me her black card and asked me to give it to the next black cloak I saw. But the hilarious part was, the person she really wanted to entrust the card with was very close. Yet she couldn't even sense her aura anymore. That was too fucking ridiculous. So I tore the card to pieces and threw it away on the spot.<strong>\"</strong> - Ophelia, on telling Miria a 'funny story'.</p><p>Ophelia was a sociopath, who found great joy in the suffering of others. To many people, she appeared to be a kind and light-hearted individual, who was quite whimsical. However, this was merely a facade. To the unlucky few, who were forced to team up with her, they quickly learned of her true nature. Ophelia was, in fact, a monster. She was a sadist, who enjoyed torturing others, often referring to it as 'fun' and 'games'. She became delighted when her victims fought back and found pleasure in their vain attempts at escape. She held no regard for human life, having hinted to killing humans, and even fellow warriors. Her view of morality was nonexistent. She was incapable of feeling guilt, remorse or shame. She took no responsibility for her own callous behavior. She, instead, blamed her victims for their own predicament, citing their own weakness as the sole reason for their suffering.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3013277\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5467032967033\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3013277\"><img alt=\"She be crazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg 620w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg 413w\"><noscript><img alt=\"She be crazy\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg 620w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3013277-0150652211-Claym.jpg 413w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\"></noscript></a><figcaption>She be crazy</figcaption></figure><p>During fights she appeared to be quite rash and reckless, disregarding the safety of herself and others. She would impulsively jump into battle, forcing her companions to act without her. During battles, she often mocked her victims, laughing at how they were weaker than her. Ophelia was also an extremely blood lusted individual, who loved the thrill of battle. Despite these traits, Ophelia was quite intuitive. She was able to kill an Awakened Being by playing dead and deduced that Clare faked her own death by the way she fell into the river.</p><p>Like many sociopaths, Ophelia suffered from a low tolerance to frustration and could not control her violent temper. She would burst out in anger whenever someone interrupted her 'fun' and 'games', as noted when Raki and Ilena interrupted her when she was 'playing' with Clare. Also, Ophelia seemed to despise people who try to sacrifice themselves in order to protect others, particularly weaker individuals. This stemmed from a misinterpretation of her brother's sacrifice to save her life, possibly because the truth of it was too painful for her to accept.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3099877\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5631868131868\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3099877\"><img alt=\"Broken mind\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" data-width=\"409\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg 614w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg 409w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Broken mind\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg 614w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099877-2682646068-Claym.jpg 409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" data-width=\"409\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Broken mind</figcaption></figure><p>When Ophelia awakened, she was initially unaware of her new state of being. Due to her innate hate for Awakened Beings, she subconsciously denied having awakened. Instead, she attributed her increase appetite as being normal and saw nothing weird in wanting to eat human entrails.</p><p>In her awakened state, Ophelia's personality traits were greatly magnified. Her manic state before awakening was increased to full-blown mania. She displayed signs of hyper-aggression, fixation and recklessness. She became so one-track minded in her attempt to kill Clare that she disregarded her own physical well being, resulting in the loss of both her arms and massive bodily trauma. Any form of self control she had prior to her awakening was lost, and she became a victim of her own neuroticism. In the end, she suffered a severe psychotic breakdown, and chose suicide over her current state of existence. Only by dying, did she finally regain her long lost humanity.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Hybrid Physiology</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3014229-2452520300-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3014229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.528013582343\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3014229-2452520300-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3014229\"><img alt=\"Head twisting\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3014229-2452520300-Claym.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3014229-2452520300-Claym.jpg 589w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3014229-2452520300-Claym.jpg 418w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Head twisting\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3014229-2452520300-Claym.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3014229-2452520300-Claym.jpg 589w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3014229-2452520300-Claym.jpg 418w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Head twisting</figcaption></figure><p>Ophelia had many abilities derived from an energy called yoki, which she gained from becoming a half-human, half-yoma hybrid. However, her abilities were considerably more enhanced than the average warrior. Like all warriors, Ophelia possessed increased strength, speed, durability, agility and reflexes. She could take extreme amounts of blunt force trauma, such as falls from great heights and heavy impacts. She was quicker than the average warrior and had, on numerous occasions, been able to catch her opponents off guard with her speed alone. She was fast enough to catch Clare, despite the latter having a significant lead. She also possessed a healing factor that allowed her to recover from harm. The full extent of her healing factor was never displayed, but it allowed her to continue fighting, despite her neck being broken and her head twisted 180 degrees.</p><p>In addition to all the abilities listed above, Ophelia, like all warriors, could augment her abilities by releasing yoki. By doing so, Ophelia could increase her speed and strength, thereby raising her physical output. This yoki could also be used to increase her healing factor, allowing her to heal from more severe wounds that her body normally would not be able to. This increase in her abilities was not permanent and would return to normal levels when she reduced her yoki output.</p><p>For more information on yoki or the abilities which all warriors of the Organization possess, please view the following <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/warriors-of-the-organization/4015-56205/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56205\">page</a>.</p><h3>Rippling Sword</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3064054\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5934065934066\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3064054\"><img alt=\"You can't give yourself a nickname\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" data-width=\"401\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg 602w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg 401w\"><noscript><img alt=\"You can't give yourself a nickname\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg 602w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3064054-9822579172-Claym.jpg 401w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" data-width=\"401\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can't give yourself a nickname</figcaption></figure><p>Ophelia invented this sword technique by swiftly vibrating her arm. The vibrations then travel to her sword causing it to undulate and appear as though it was rippling. This optical illusion makes it extremely difficult for an opponent to block the attack, as one cannot read the sword's movements in advance or effectively guard against the technique. When Ophelia used it against Clare, she was unable to block the technique, despite being able to read Ophelia's movements. Every time Clare raised her sword to block the incoming attack, the sword would 'snake' around her blade as though it simply went around it. However, this technique is not infallible. When Ophelia used the technique against Ilena, it was easily blocked by her quick sword. Exactly how this sword technique works remains a mystery.</p><p>One could hypothesize that Ophelia's rippling sword bypasses an enemy's defenses by quickly changing the course of her blade's movement at the last moment. When her enemy raises her sword in defense, Ophelia's vibrating arm quickly changes the direction of the blade, creating the illusion of it bending around the enemy's blade.</p><p>Jealous at how many of her fellow warriors had special names and epithets, Ophelia stated that she created this technique so that she may be called 'Rippling Ophelia'. Despite this, none called her by this name because Ophelia killed nearly everyone who witnessed her using this technique. Instead, due to her violent nature, she was infamously called the 'Blood-Smeared Wicked Warrior'.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\"

form</figcaption></figure><p>After awakening, Ophelia gained a large serpentine appearance. The upper-half of her body remained humanoid in shape, while her lower-half resembled that of a snake. The snake part of her body was several times longer than that of her upper body. It was also much thicker than her upper body and appeared to be covered in scales. The upper-half of her body appeared unclothed, as the entirety of Ophelia's breasts were clearly visible. Her arms appeared elongated and vaguely metallic in appearance, along with her shoulders, as though her uniform fused with her body upon awakening. At the end of her arms were exceptionally large hands, and instead of fingers, Ophelia had long sharp claws. Protruding from her back were three sickle like appendages. Two of them were placed in a way reminiscent of wings, with the third one being located directly behind her head, where her ponytail used to be. Due to her reptilian appearance, Ophelia had no hair on her head, instead they were replaced with hair-like appendages, which seemed fleshy in nature. Her face remained, for the most part, the same. She still retained her elf-like ears and overall facial features, though more grotesque in appearance.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3100571-iclaymore_v08c040_fit_for_battle_iv.claymore_v08_020.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3100571\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.93406593406593\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3100571-iclaymore_v08c040_fit_for_battle_iv.claymore_v08_020.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3100571\"><img alt=\"Her alternate appearance\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3100571-iclaymore_v08c040_fit_for_battle_iv.claymore_v08_020.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3100571-iclaymore_v08c040_fit_for_battle_iv.claymore_v08_020.jpg 364w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3100571-iclaymore_v08c040_fit_for_battle_iv.claymore_v08_020.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Her alternate appearance\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3100571-iclaymore_v08c040_fit_for_battle_iv.claymore_v08_020.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3100571-iclaymore_v08c040_fit_for_battle_iv.claymore_v08_020.jpg 364w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3100571-iclaymore_v08c040_fit_for_battle_iv.claymore_v08_020.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Her alternate appearance</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099747-7289462939-Ophel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3099747\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.98449612403101\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099747-7289462939-Ophel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3099747\"><img alt=\"Her awakened appearance\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099747-7289462939-Ophel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099747-7289462939-Ophel.jpg 387w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099747-7289462939-Ophel.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Her awakened appearance\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099747-7289462939-Ophel.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099747-7289462939-Ophel.jpg 387w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099747-7289462939-Ophel.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Her awakened appearance</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Powers and Abilities</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3099901\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5947802197802\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3099901\"><img alt=\"Black Mamba\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" data-width=\"401\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg 601w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg 401w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Mamba\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg 728w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg 601w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137152/3099901-2008502815-Claym.jpg 401w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" data-width=\"401\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Mamba</figcaption></figure><p>In her awakened form, Ophelia gained increased speed, durability, and offensive capabilities. She was capable of moving quickly and was agile enough to dodge attacks, despite her large frame. She was durable enough to block sword attacks with her bare hands and was unhurt by a sword strike to the face. She was skilled enough to use her body to her advantage, using her serpentine tail to trap and attack Clare. In addition to these augmented attributes, she gained some abilities unique to her awakened state. She was able to produce blade-like appendages from her body, when enraged, to attack her foes. Her face also distorts into a monstrous appearance when angry. She also developed the ability to move her vital organs to different parts of her body, making it more difficult to kill her. After moving her vital parts to the tip of her tail, Ophelia displayed the ability to shoot tentacle-like outgrowths from her main body. These allow her to impale her victims in multiple spots and keep them immobilized. Despite having never shown any regenerative capabilities, Ophelia stated to Clare that she would start regenerating if Clare did not kill her.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"left\"

She became so powerful she was known as a Creature of the Abyss. She ruled and lived in the west with her lover Dauf. They were first seeen when trying to recruit Claymores into awakening them and helped them fight against Isley. She would lure them into towns with yoma and capture them and force them to awaken and she if they were strong. If there were not dauf kills them. Eventually Clare figures out their trap and heads to their castle. She then runs into Dauf and Riful she starts to fight him until Galatea arrives and takes over while she saves the reamaining Claymore's. After saving Jeane they there of them team up and try to take out Dauf. Riful takes great interest in watching them battle making her eager to join her. She tells dauf to hurry up and make them awake or else she will dump him. Doing what she says he continues to attack them until they find his weak spot and finish him. But Riful steps in and saves her lover. Clare tries to strike only to ser spit in half and reveal her awaken form. She then tells care who rules the north (Due to asking her about Priscilla). She then takes Dauf and leaves. She is seen later when Isleys hordes start marching towards the west.</p><h2>Seven Years Later</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2855555-riful_profilepicture.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2855555\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1715481171548\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2855555-riful_profilepicture.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2855555\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2855555-riful_profilepicture.png\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2855555-riful_profilepicture.png 478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-width=\"478\"></a></figure><p>Riful has survived her battle with Isley and Priscilla and has been trying to figure out a way to defeat them both. She then tries again to recruit some of the new Claymors with certain talents. But again Clare interupts her plans. After their battle Clare asked her about the balance of power between the Abysal ones. She replied that Priscilla is far stronger than Isley and that there was something amiss between them. She then leaves.</p><p>Riful then set her sights on a Claymore named Renee.

Antoinelle had strict rules and was abusive towards her nephew. Emery was tired of living in a poor lifestyle and wanted to make something of himself. Emery was a mutant that could produce a force field and fire concussive blasts from his hands. Emery was doing small robbery gigs on his own until his Aunt discovered his illegal activities. Antoinelle told him that he was headed in the wrong path but Emery refused to listen and stormed out of their shack.

Antoinelle was distraught when she saw her dead nephew and decided to resurrect him as a zombie to exact revenge on Gambit. Antoinelle was a powerful witch doctor and her resurrection spell brought forth an army of zombies that terrorized the streets of New Orleans. Gambit and <a href=\"/brother-voodoo/4005-10280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10280\">Brother Voodoo</a> tried their best to defend themselves against zombie Emery and the horde of the living dead. Detective Tanaka informs Gambit and Brother Voodoo that Antoinelle was the one responsible for raising the dead so they headed towards her shack in the swamp. Gambit convinces Antoinelle that he wasn't responsible for her nephew's death and that Emery deserves peace than being a member of the living dead.

    "description": "<p>During the early months of the Clone Wars, Fay traveled to the planet Queyta with the Force guiding her, where she met Jedi masters Nico Diath, Jon Antilles, and Knol Ven'nari-loner Jedi like herself. It was with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi who arrived late and told them that his mission was to find an antidote to a deadly swamp gas the Separatist were using in the war located at the factory. As they found the antidote, one by one the Jedi masters fell by the attacks the bounty hunter Durge and the dark Jedi Asajj Ventress, until it was only Obi-wan and her left. As they made their escape, Asajj stabbed Fay from behind. Before she died, Fay gave Obi-wan the strength needed to make it back to Coruscant with the antidote. <br/> <br/>Back at the Jedi Temple, A monument was made for her and the fallen Jedi masters who died.</p>",

    "deck": "A powerful Jedi turned Sith, Ulic was a driving force of the Great Sith War. Ulic was known as both a hero and traitor to the Jedi Order. His connection to the Force was ultimately severed by Nomi Sunrider, after an enraged Ulic killed his own brother.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Ulic was born to revered Jedi Master Lien-Tsai Qel-Droma on the planet Alderaan. Ulic and his brother Car were both very strong in the Force, but at first were denied Jedi training. Eventually they started Jedi training under Master Arca Jeth on the planet Arcania. Joining Ulic and his brother was the Twi'Lek Tott Doneeta. During his training Ulic exhibited considerable skills with both the Force and lightsaber combat. Ulic was the most gifted of Master Arca's students but also displayed a lot of arrogance.</p><p>Some believed this was just how he showed his confidence, but as events later in his life would show, his arrogance would be his undoing. Master Arca was made Jedi watchman of the planet Onderon. When he deemed his students' training complete, he sent them out on their first mission. Ulic and his friends were sent to quell a dispute on Onderon, between the people of Iziz and the attacking Beast Riders.</p><h2>Onderon and Freedon Nadd</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657422-ulic_profile.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1657422\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.68\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:168.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657422-ulic_profile.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1657422\"><img alt=\"Ulic Qel-Droma; Jedi Knight\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657422-ulic_profile.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657422-ulic_profile.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"></a><figcaption>Ulic Qel-Droma; Jedi Knight</figcaption></figure><p>Ulic, Cay and Tott arrived in Iziz, the capital of Onderon and immediately took part in a battle between the people of the City and the Beast Riders who lived in the jungle beyond the city walls. The Princess of Onderon was kidnapped and the three Jedi pursued the Beast Riders into the jungle. Their ship was shot down and after being taken by the Beast Riders, the Jedi troupe uncovered several surprising truths. The first of which was that the Princess intended to leave her people and marry the Prince of the Beast Riders; Oron Kira. In addition, it was discovered that Iziz was the driving force behind the war, rather than the Beast Riders as originally believed. Finally, the Jedi came to realise that the powers of Iziz had become interlinked with the Dark Side of the Force. It was revealed that the former Jedi cum Sith Lord Freedon Nadd had polluted the planet with his Dark Side influence and that the ruling powers were his descendants. The Jedi, Princess Galia and the Beast Riders decided to overthrow the evil Amanoa and bring peace to Onderon</p><p>It was here that the Jedi first encountered the true power of the Dark Side as the Sith Sorceress Queen Amanoa attempted to destroy her aggressors. The fight was eventually ended when Arca Jeth appeared and used his Battle Meditation technique to defeat the forces of Amanoa.

The Naddists were lead by the deposed former King of Iziz, the Sith Sorcerer King Ommin, who despite his incredibly weak physique was very powerful in the ways of the Sith. The King captured Arca Jeth, and was consequently slain by Ulic himself. Then, appearing before the Jedi, was the spectre of Freedon Nadd. He revealed his intended purpose for Onderon, to be a breeding ground for the Sith, and taunted Ulic with the prediction that he would become one of the greatest Sith in the galaxy. Ulic denied this premonition.</p><h2>The Krath and the Descent into Darkness</h2><p>During the Naddist Uprising, a new threat had surfaced. The Krath, a secret society created by the aspiring Sith Satal Keto and his cousin, Aleema, staged a coup overthrowing their parents with their newfound Sith power (gained from amulets found on Onderon during the conflict) and taking control of the Empress Teta System. Despite their youth, the duo proved quite formidable in the areas of Sith Alchemy and particularly in the case of Aleema, the casting of Illusions.</p><p>Ulic took it upon himself to combat this threat in a manner no other Jedi would; he intended to inflitrate the Krath as a double</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657421-ulic_and_nomi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1657421\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0542495479204\" data-width=\"553\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 553px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657421-ulic_and_nomi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1657421\"><img alt=\"Ulic and Nomi\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657421-ulic_and_nomi.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657421-ulic_and_nomi.jpg 553w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ulic and Nomi\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657421-ulic_and_nomi.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657421-ulic_and_nomi.jpg 553w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ulic and Nomi</figcaption></figure><p>agent, learn their secrets and destroy them from within. Ulic's reasoning was that if the Jedi were simply to eliminate the Krath, their methods and powers would forever remain a mystery, and more importantly, a constant threat. However, if Ulic was able to learn the Krath's way, and thus how to overcome it, he would effectively remove the threat of this Sith power for good. Despite harsh protests from his fellow Jedi, Ulic remained fiercely stubborn regarding the matter. The Jedi believed that Ulic's plan was overly ambitious and arrogant, and bordered on dangerous, as he could be very easily seduced by the Dark Side. However, before any decision could be made, the Jedi were ambused by Krath War Droids. In the ensuing battle, Ulic was saved by his Master, only to watch him die almost immediately after. Blaming himself for the death of Arca, Ulic plunged into despair and declared that he would infiltrate the Krath, much to the displeasure of his brother and Nomi Sunrider. Ulic and Nomi had falled in love after the events on Onderon. Before setting out on his mission, Ulic passionately kissed Nomi, assuring her that he would return and would not be corrupted.</p><p>Upon arriving on Cinnagar, within the Empress Teta System, Ulic was immediately noticed by security, his presence looked upon with paranoia and anger by Satal, and interest by Aleema. Ulic soon came upon a public execution, when suddenly an attempt on the life of the Krath leadership was made. Seeing this as an opportunity to gain favor with the Krath, Ulic helped subdue and slay the attackers. Little did Ulic know that the attempt was orchestrated by Aleema in order to test his worth. After meeting the distrustful Satal and alluring Aleema, Ulic was tortured with Sith Chemicals; a Dark Side compound used to strengthen a victim's anger and make them more susceptible to corruption.</p><p>Despite the grueling process, Ulic survived the torture culminating in a burst of Dark Side energy emanating from the captive. It was at this time that Ulic's friends, Tott, Cay and Nomi began to worry about him and decided to try and rescue Ulic. Upon sighting Nomi, Ulic ordered her to be imprisoned, in order to keep up his charade. He later spoke to Nomi, saying that he wished to remain with the Krath for a while longer, so as to learn their secrets. However, this conversation was not secure as Ulic had believed as his treachery was discovered by Satal; who consequently he sentenced two Jedi to death.</p><p>Satal sent an assassin to kill Ulic, but was unsuccessful. An enraged Ulic then confronted his attacker, and blaming him for the death of Arca Jeth, and the attempt on his life, Ulic struck the Krath Leader down. Nomi and the other Jedi escaped, intending to return and rescue Ulic. Ulic however, had become enamoured with Aleema, the two becoming lovers and decided that he wished to remain with the Krath.</p><p>Cay pleaded with his brother to return with them as he loved and feared the path he was on, Ulic was not interested, however, and threatened to murder Cay should he not leave Ulic alone. A distraught Cay and a heartbroken Nomi left Ulic alone to continue his journey toward the Dark Side.</p><h2>Exar Kun and the Rise of the Sith</h2><p>After the intervention of Cay and Nomi, Exar Kun (another Dark Jedi) confronted Ulic in the process of trying to destroy the Krath and recover a Sith amulet in their possession. Aleema was severely injured and Ulic and Exar engaged in a lightsaber duel. Their combined rage released an ancient Sith spirit, who claimed both of them for the Dark Side. Exar Kun was named the Dark Lord of the Sith and Ulic was named as his apprentice.</p><p>Soon Ulic added the Mandalorians to the ranks of his Sith army. He became the leader of the Mandalorians after defeating their leader Mandalore in combat. He led attack after attack on Republic military resources, but decided to choose a very high profile and important target. He led an attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant, but was captured after being betrayed and abandoned by Aleema. He was brought to trial, but freed after the intervention on Exar Kun. He dealt with the treachery of Aleema by tricking her into undertaking a suicidal battle with the Jedi at the Kemplex IX space station.</p><p>Ulic travelled with Exar Kun to Ossus in order to take possession of the Jedi Library. They hoped to gain access to the ancient Sith knowledge stored within its vaults. Ulic was confronted by his brother Cay, and they fought in a fierce duel. In his Dark Side fury, Ulic cut down and murdered his brother. Some part of the Light Side still remained in him, and Ulic was brought to his knees by the horror of what he had just done done. Nomi Sunrider, enraged by Ulic's actions, used the Force in anger and cut Ulic off from the Force. No longer able to access the force, weakened, and realizing all the wrong he had done, he turned on Exar Kun and used what he knew of the Sith lord to help the Jedi defeat him. Ulic led the Jedi to Yavin 4, where they were able to defeat Kun and quell the Sith uprising.</p><h2>Redemption and Death</h2><p>Ulic wandered the galaxy in the 10 years after the death of his brother and then end of the Great Sith War, trying to reconnect with the Force. Losing his ability to use the Force after he murdered his brother haunted him. He was eventually taken to the planer Rhen Var by the pilot Hoggon. Rhen Var was cold but abandoned and Ulic decided to stay and seek peace. Eventually Vima Sunrider would track Ulic down and asked him to train her as a Jedi. Ulic refused on the basis he was cut off from the Force and in no position to teach her as he had been seduced by the Dark Side. Eventually Vima would convince him to train her. Ulic ended up being a good master and in the process was able to find some peace and honor his former master, Arca Jeth.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657423-ulic_shot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1657423\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6025641025641\" data-width=\"936\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 936px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:160.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657423-ulic_shot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1657423\"><img alt=\"Ulic slain by Hoggon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" data-width=\"936\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657423-ulic_shot.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657423-ulic_shot.jpg 936w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/1657423-ulic_shot.jpg 599w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ulic slain by Hoggon\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657423-ulic_shot.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657423-ulic_shot.jpg 936w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/1657423-ulic_shot.jpg 599w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" data-width=\"936\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ulic slain by Hoggon</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually with the aid of Hoggon, Nomi Sunrider tracked down her daughter and confronted Ulic wanting to take Vima home. The Jedi, Sylvar, had followed Nomi to Rhen Var, seeking revenge against Ulic. She confronted the fallen Jedi because she blamed him for the death of her mate Crado during the Great Sith War. The two fought a lighsaber duel and despite no longer being able to use the Force, Ulic held his own. He saw the anger and rage fueling Sylvar and refused to fight further. She swung her lightsaber to strike Ulic down, but stopped herself at the last second. The former Sith and focus of her anger was ultimately the one to make her realize she too was falling to the Dark Side, and Sylvar returned to the light. Hoggon, seeing this as his chance to gain fame and rid the galaxy of one of it's greatest war criminals, shot and killed Ulic. Nomi held the dying Ulic in her arms as he asked for her forgiveness. She forgave him for everything and said that she still loved him.</p><p>Ulic gave Vima a necklace so she would remember his teachings. As Ulic died, he became one with the Force and his body disappeared, something that only happened to Jedi Masters. He found redemption by teaching Vima and finding his own inner peace in the process. He had rediscovered what it meant to be a Jedi and how to serve the Force, even though he had been cut off from it for over a decade. In the end the fallen Jedi and former Sith became a Jedi Master.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657424-ulic_s_death.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1657424\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0823529411765\" data-width=\"595\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 595px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657424-ulic_s_death.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1657424\"><img alt=\"Vima Sunrider cradling a fallen Ulic\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" data-width=\"595\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657424-ulic_s_death.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657424-ulic_s_death.jpg 595w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Vima Sunrider cradling a fallen Ulic\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657424-ulic_s_death.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1657424-ulic_s_death.jpg 595w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" data-width=\"595\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Vima Sunrider cradling a fallen Ulic</figcaption></figure><p>The story of Ulic's fall and redemption would be told to Jedi until the fall of the Old Republic. <a href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\">Anakin Skywalker</a> found a holographic recording of Ulic Qel-Droma during the clone wars.

    "deck": "A puppet created by the Adversary to pose as the conqueror of the Homelands.",
    "description": "<p>The Emperor apparently came from kingdom beyond the farthest shores of Never. The Emperor was apparently ignored by other powers and kingdoms, this was what he apparently used to his advantage. While they ignored him, this helped his strength grow more in power with each battle and conquest. Many Fables have not really seen him, rumors had it he was a woodland sprite and some say he was a god; who had been thrown from the Heavens when his corruptions became too great for his lofty brethren to tolerate. In <a data-ref-id=\"4050-27350\" href=\"/fables-legends-in-exile/4050-27350/\" slug=\"fables-legends-in-exile\">Fables Legends In Exile</a>, some of the Fables believed him to be a type of satyr or Lucifer looking monster.</p><p>However, this was all most likely fabricated to glamorize or make him appear more terrify to his enemies. Unknown to all, but perhaps Lumi, was that the Emperor was really no more than a very well made puppet by Geppetto. He used the Emperor to serve as the mastermind, when in reality it was Geppetto pulling the strings all along. The Emperor was brought to life using an elixir from the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59056\" href=\"/blue-fairy/4005-59056/\" slug=\"blue-fairy\">Blue Fairy</a>, whom Geppetto had knocked unconscious. Due to Pinocchio's constant adventures, leaving Geppetto alone, the Blue Fairy had now put loyalty spells on any of Geppetto's future children, including the Emperor. This is a secret, Geppetto and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47096\" href=\"/snow-queen/4005-47096/\" slug=\"snow-queen\">Snow Queen</a> have gone to great lengths to hide from his enemies and allies.</p><p>During his raise to power, the Emerald Kingdom in Oz was one of the many kingdoms he conquered. One by one, he defeated many including the Great Lion, though many of the Fables when they were in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56139\" href=\"/homelands/4020-56139/\" slug=\"homelands\">Homelands</a> did nothing. This would be a mistake as he eventually began to conquer the Homelands spreading like a plague, most likely with the help of Geppetto's wooden soldiers and goblins. Due to this, this caused the Fables to flee and leave the Homelands for mundane world.</p><p>However this didn't hide them from the Emperor, as Bigby and the others often kept eyes out for spies. Using <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5979\" href=\"/cinderella/4005-5979/\" slug=\"cinderella\">Cinderella</a>, they discovered one of their own, Ichabod Crane had planned to betray Fabletown and join the Emperor. However, he was stopped. In <a data-ref-id=\"4045-56316\" href=\"/homelands/4045-56316/\" slug=\"homelands\">Homelands</a> arc, Boy Blue foolishly attempted to kill the Emperor using the vorpal sword and his magic cape. While he managed to get in and beheaded the Emperor, it was too good to be true. The Ice Queen froze him before he escaped.</p><p>Blue awoke in a cage and much to his surprise, Geppetto was there along with the Emperor's head. And it is there, he discovers the truth about the Emperor and what Geppetto really is. As the day went Geppetto explained how he himself became the real Adversary. Through promises of seeing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7270\" href=\"/red-riding-hood/4005-7270/\" slug=\"red-riding-hood\">Red Riding Hood</a>, Blue gave Geppetto the now apparently dead wooden Pinocchio. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44960\" href=\"/geppetto/4005-44960/\" slug=\"geppetto\">Geppetto</a> revived him with the elixir, this didn't stop Boy Blue's determination to leave. He escaped with Red, but had to leave Pinocchio due to his loyalty spell. Pinocchio was now part of his \"brother's\" kingdom.</p><p>While not much has been shown with either relationship, Pinocchio seemed to go about with his new life. Mostly getting drunk, and often seen wandering away from home. During the Emperor's birthday, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7268\" href=\"/pinocchio/4005-7268/\" slug=\"pinocchio\">Pinocchio</a> tried to be kind and give his father a birthday present. While his relationship with Lumi has never been fully defined, he is often seen consulting with her and was shown most distressed when she was under the affect of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7273\" href=\"/briar-rose/4005-7273/\" slug=\"briar-rose\">Briar Rose</a>'s sleeping curse.</p><p>Unlike the wooden soldiers, the Emperor is shown to have more intellect and is shown to express different opinions. But due to the spell, he's often forced to obey and listen to his father's word. Eventually in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-27335\" href=\"/fables-war-and-pieces/4050-27335/\" slug=\"fables-war-and-pieces\">War and Pieces</a> arc, the Emperor was defeated by Bigby Wolf and the assistance of Prince Charming who sacrificed his life.</p><p>However, his story may not be over yet.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Heggra's Choosing</strong></p><p>Tigra was not <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid's</a> first choice as a wife. He originally married <a href=\"/suli/4005-23444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23444\">Suli</a>. Unfortunatly for Darkseid, <a href=\"/heggra/4005-37501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37501\">Heggra</a> didn't approve of Suli, and hired <a href=\"/desaad/4005-4681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4681\">Desaad</a> to kill her. When the deed was done, Heggra forced her son to marry the woman of her choosing, Tigra.</p><p><strong>With Child</strong></p><p>When Darkseid first went through the Infinity Pits, one of the first things he was going to do was murder his wife. When he was preparing to use his new Omega Beams for the first time, Tigra told her enraged husband that she was with child. Darkseid let her live for this.</p><p><strong>A Lie?</strong></p><p>Long after Tigra had her son <a href=\"/orion/4005-2363/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2363\">Orion</a>, she claimed he was not Darkseid's son. Tigra stated how she only told him she was pregnant to save her own life, knowing Darkseid wouldn't turn down an heir. In this telling, she says she was never truly pregnant when she told this to Darkseid, so she met with a captain of the Imperial Guard. She says the only thing that mattered was that he was handsome and willing.</p><p><strong>Bio-Freeze</strong></p><p>A few months later, Darkseid had other plans for Tigra. In exchange for slaying Suli, he decided to have Desaad kill his mother, Queen Heggra. He figured having a child during this time wouldn't be appropriate, so he had Tigra imprisoned in a Bio-Freeze Pod until he was ready for his child to come.</p><p><strong>Orion</strong></p><p>It wasn't until almost a thousand years later that Darkseid decided he was ready for Tigra to have her son. Tigra went off and had her son as far away from Darkseid as she could. The lackeys who helped her deliver said she never screamed, but hissed, and the baby didn't cry. She killed one of them while giving birth to her son. She named the boy Orion.</p><p><strong>The Trade</strong></p><p>During this time, <a href=\"../../apokolips/34-41470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apokolips</a> was in war with its neighboring planet, <a href=\"../../new-genesis/34-41471/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Genesis</a>. To stop the war, <a href=\"/highfather/4005-5324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5324\">Highfather</a> and Darkseid decided to trade sons. Darkseid gave Highfather Orion for his son, soon to be known as <a href=\"/mr-miracle/4005-5703/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5703\">Mister Miracle</a>. When the word came to Tigra's ears, she came into a rage. To settle her down, Darkseid had Tigra locked up.</p><p><strong>\"Saved\"</strong></p><p>Years later, Orion came back to Apokolips. Quite loyal to Highfather, and wanting answers to his life, he tried to find Tigra. It took him six days of rummaging through the planet to find her. Orion broke Tigra out even though she was reluctant to go. She told him that no matter if her body is free, her soul will never be, for she has witnessed the gentle nature of Darkseid.</p><p><strong>Assassinated</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3193059-orion3p06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3193059\" data-ratio=\"1.1537656903766\" data-width=\"956\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 956px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3193059-orion3p06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3193059\"><img alt=\"Tigra's Death\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/120019/3193059-orion3p06.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120019/3193059-orion3p06.jpg 956w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/120019/3193059-orion3p06.jpg 832w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px\" data-width=\"832\"></a><figcaption>Tigra's Death</figcaption></figure><p>Being jealous of Tigra for being married to Darkseid, Desaad's second in command, <a href=\"/justeen/4005-21185/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21185\"> Justeen</a>, had Tigra assassinated.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Magilla is a big, kind, naive gorilla on sale at Peebles' Pet Shop, run by Mr. Peebles, who has been trying to sell Magilla since he was just a baby. The price for Magilla Gorilla has gone down through time, because no one wanted to buy Magilla. Although he has been purchased temporarily to play on a football team, assist in robbing banks, experimentation, hunting, etc. But there was only one little girl named Ogee who really wanted him for a pet, but never really had enough money, and her parents did not allow it. In each episode of The Magilla Gorilla Show (1964), Whenever Magilla is bought, he is always returned to Mr. Peeble's shop, for various and comedic reasons.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Summary</h2><p>Crazy Eight is a normal man, and a full-time super-villain. He is first seen in <a data-ref-id=\"4000-45467\" href=\"/spider-girl-bedeviled/4000-45467/\" slug=\"spider-girl-bedeviled\">Spider-Girl #2</a> , where he hires a group of militants inside a ware house. He has a showdown with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3365\" href=\"/spider-girl/4005-3365/\" slug=\"spider-girl\">Spider-Girl</a> but manages to get the upper hand the first time. But he isn't so lucky the next time. Spider-Girl becomes familiar with his attack moves and easily defeats him. He is arrested, appearing next in the court-house, when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-18427\" href=\"/mr-nobody/4005-18427/\" slug=\"mr-nobody\">Mr. Nobody</a> shows up to release him. The plan fails when Spider-Girl shows up inside the courthouse. Crazy Eight almost escapes but Peter Parker blocks his way.</p><p>Later, when Crazy Eight is released from jail, he works with the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\" href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" slug=\"kingpin\">Kingpin</a> during a city-wide crime war and gains Mr. Nobody as his partner. He realizes that his brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20116\" href=\"/funny-face/4005-20116/\" slug=\"funny-face\">Funny Face</a> is on opposite sides, working with rival crime-lord <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8673\" href=\"/canis/4005-8673/\" slug=\"canis\">Canis</a> . This brings him to constant verbal showdowns with his brother. Things come to a head when, during a conflict involving Spider-Girl, the 'new' <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57863\" href=\"/gerry-drew/4005-57863/\" slug=\"gerry-drew\">Spider-Man</a>, Mr Nobody, Funny Face and Crazy Eight, when Mr Nobody (aiming for Spider-Man) shoots Crazy Eight in the heat of battle.</p><p>Crazy Eight's death causes his brother Funny Face to turn on his employer, Canis, breaking his mother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54524\" href=\"/angel-face/4005-54524/\" slug=\"angel-face\">Angel Face</a> out of her asylum and waging war on both Canis and the Kingpin, causing the rival crime lord's millions in damages, leading to a temporary end to the war.</p><h2>Powers</h2><ul><li>Athletic moves and hand-to-hand combat skills</li><li>Eight-ball is armed with spikes, buzz-bombs, poisonous gas, concussive blasts, sonic weaponry and electrical jolts</li></ul>",

Lt. Shrieve thought that seeing 'the freaks' and having them put on a scary show would cheer the kids up. The kids were cheered up alright, but he was the butt of the joke, not his team. The kids were wowed by the Myrna and her team and thought they were amazing, while they thought Shrieve was a world-class jerk for calling them names.</p><p>After the show, Myrna and her team visited with the kids one-on one, signed casts, and did their best to cheer the kids up.</p><p>Shrieve left them to their own devices for a little while while he was being briefed on a new mission. Myrna and <a href=\"/elliot-taylor/4005-32377/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32377\">Lucky</a> went walking in the park then, and Myrna saw a couple kissing.

They were sent to investigate some attacks on Allied forces on the pacific ocean. They flew out by plane and were attacked by a large flying dinosaur. Their plane went down, but <a href=\"/vincent-velcoro/4005-32378/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32378\">Velcro</a> managed to kill the dinosaur and they all were able to swim clear of the wreckage before the plane went down.</p><p>It was then a sea monster attacked, but they were saved by J.A.K.E.1 (the first <a href=\"/gi-robot/4005-32422/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32422\">G.I.

Myrna told Shrieve that his panic attack was all in his head, that they had plenty of air, and then told J.A.K.E.1 not to mind Shrieve, that he was raised by hyenas (a joke on her part, as far as we know).</p><p>When they met the ones who'd captured them, they found out they were an off-shot of ancient Atlantian civilization who had founded a civilization of their own called <a href=\"/lemuria/4020-55791/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55791\">Lemuria</a>. Because of Myrna's appearance, they accused her of being one of their ancient enemies, the gorgons. Myrna attempted to use her gaze to turn one to stone, and when it didn't work, she offered that as proof that she wasn't truly a gorgon.</p><p>The Lemurian leader laughed it off, explaining that his people had long ago transferred their consciousness into robot bodies that were impervious to such magic. (<strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Medusa doesn't have the power to turn anyone who looks at her to stone, and this in the only time in her appearances in the Weird War Tales series where it's hinted at that she might be able to do it by will. Whether she could or not isn't known, though in some of her post-Crisis on Infinite Earths stories, she does have an ability that's somewhat similar.)</p><p>A battle ensues, and the team, along with J.A.K.E.1, beats the Lemurians.

Myrna had been reading this article in the paper, about a pilgrimage to the shine at Lourdes, where, in 1858, the Virgin Mary was supposed to have appeared to a peasant girl named Bernadette Soubirous. Hundreds of people make the trip there every year on the 20th of August to pray for a miracle to heal them of their ills. Myrna suggests they should try going as well, since they don't have anything else to do, and the others agree.</p><p>When they get there though, they find the Nazis have taken the pilgrims hostage.

The pilgrims are freed and Shrieve ends up taking his post back as their commanding officer, though, sadly, he's still the same guy with the same old cruel insults on the tip of his tongue.</p><h3>Heroes Come In Small Sizes</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4292751\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292751-medusa-metals.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.91762013729977\" data-width=\"874\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 874px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292751-medusa-metals.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4292751\"><img alt=\"giving away their metals to the blind children\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" data-width=\"874\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292751-medusa-metals.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292751-medusa-metals.jpg 874w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4292751-medusa-metals.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"giving away their metals to the blind children\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292751-medusa-metals.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292751-medusa-metals.jpg 874w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4292751-medusa-metals.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" data-width=\"874\"></noscript></a><figcaption>giving away their metals to the blind children</figcaption></figure><p>(in <a href=\"/weird-war-tales-118/4000-22655/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-22655\">Weird War Tales #118</a>, Dec 1982)</p><p>In their down time, the Myrna and her team take a group of children from a home for the blind on a picnic in the south of Fontainbleau.

Shrieve.</p><h3>Death Smiles Thrice!</h3><p>(in <a href=\"/weird-war-tales-121/4000-22934/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-22934\">Weird War Tales #121</a>, Mar 1983)</p><p>Myrna and her team go on a mission to Holland to take out a windmill the Nazis are using as a missile launching site to blow up Allied fighter planes and end up going up against Nazi robots disguised as regular Nazi soldiers. On the way, they apparently rescue three blond female triplets who claim to be freedom fighters who escaped a Nazi concentration camp. They turn out to be Nazi robots in disguise too though and they attack the team. Myrna blows them up with a grenade and the team completes the mission.</p><h3>Sent Into Space</h3><p>Myrna and her team were sent into space when they would no longer fight.</p><h2>Creature Commandos</h2><p>(in <a href=\"/creature-commandos/4050-28760/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28760\">Creature Commandos #1-8</a> May-Dec 2000)</p><p>A new and different version of Myrna appears in this 8-issue series.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4292844\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4457994579946\" data-width=\"738\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4292844\"><img alt=\"a whole new Myrna\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg 738w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg 442w\"><noscript><img alt=\"a whole new Myrna\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg 738w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132823/4292844-medusa-cc.jpg 442w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\"></noscript></a><figcaption>a whole new Myrna</figcaption></figure><h2>Superman: New Krypton</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4293744\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.34633569739953\" data-width=\"1692\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1692px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:34.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4293744\"><img alt=\"meeting Superman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg 1692w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg 960w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"meeting Superman\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg 1692w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg 960w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/132823/4293744-medusa-newkrypton.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>meeting Superman</figcaption></figure><p>(in <a href=\"/action-comics-872-new-krypton-part-7-brainiac-live/4000-145239/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-145239\">Action Comics #872</a>, Feb 2009)</p><p>In a continuation of Myrna and her team's pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths storyline, <a href=\"/alura/4005-31100/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31100\">Alura</a>, <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>, and <a href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl</a> find Myrna, Lucky, Velcro, Griffith, G.I Robot, and Lt Shrieve in suspended animation, having been taken prisoner by <a href=\"/brainiac/4005-4684/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4684\">Brainiac</a> at some point during their journey among the stars.

    "description": "<blockquote>Backstory</blockquote> <p>Isley was the first of the male Claymores and was ranked #1. Eventually he awakened and became the first Abyssal One. He was most powerful of that generation and was known as The White SIlver King. He has been alive for many years and has seen most of the 48 generations of Claymores. Isley took over the north lands upon gaining status as an Abyssal One. He has a army of the reamaining male Claymores, and had <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56360\" href=\"/rigardo/4005-56360/\" slug=\"rigardo\">Rigardo</a> working for him. Eventually Isley and Rigardo encountered <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56359\" href=\"/priscilla/4005-56359/\" slug=\"priscilla\">Priscilla</a> when she was on her destrutive rampage. They battled her and eventually lost before she was about to kill them Priscilla reverted back to her human form with no recognition of what happened. Isley then reverted and swore allegiance to Priscilla, and since then they have been traveling ever since. With Priscilla his ally he then decided to gather all of his men and started to take make his way to take over the regions controlled by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55550\" href=\"/riful/4005-55550/\" slug=\"riful\">Riful</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56095\" href=\"/luciela/4005-56095/\" slug=\"luciela\">Luciela</a>. Isley then met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55536\" href=\"/raki/4005-55536/\" slug=\"raki\">Raki</a> before heading to the south. Priscilla took a liking to him so Isley decided to let Raki join them until he finds Clare. Isley also took a liking to Raki and decided to teach him how to use a sword. After he took over the reamaining villages in the north Isley made his way to south to battle Luciela. They then began to battle and Isley was gaining the upper hand on Luciela. But she retreated and was later killed by her sister Rafaela. Isley then gained control of the south. Now Isley is making his way to the west to kill Riful.</p> <blockquote>Seven Years Later</blockquote><br/>Isley is found in human form at Helen's hometown. He immediately acknowledges Helen and Deneve even with their Yoki masked. The pair just tried to pass Isley by but he struck Deneve down without hesistation. Isley engages Helen in battle while still in human form. He nearly kills Helen before Deneve recovers to join the fight. The pair ready themselves for a final battle with Isley. They are interrupted by creatures identified as Abyssal Feeders. Isley reveals his true form taking on a horde of the demonic enemy. No matter how many times Isley strikes down the demons they regenerate and long to devour him.<br/><br/><br/> <blockquote>Powers &amp; Abilites</blockquote><br/>Isley is very skilled in using a sword as he was seen teaching Raki how to use one. When he awakens he becomes a jet black centaur with a bow in one arm and a spear in the other. With his bow he can creat living arrows to which he can control where they go.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/435824-isley_picture_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-435824\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4397759103641\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/435824-isley_picture_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-435824\"><img alt=\"Isley as he appears when awakened.\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19859/435824-isley_picture_6.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/435824-isley_picture_6.jpg 714w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19859/435824-isley_picture_6.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Isley as he appears when awakened.</figcaption></figure>",

    "description": "<h2>History:</h2><p>Dawn Blackthorne is the twin sister of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55624\" href=\"/dusk-blackthorne/4005-55624/\" slug=\"dusk-blackthorne\">Dusk Blackthorne</a> and the favorite daughter. She is the polar opposite of Dusk as she can manipulate light while her sister manipulates shadows. Dawn is the member of the family that holds the others together. She is very close to her mother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55629\" href=\"/kitty-blackthorne/4005-55629/\" slug=\"kitty-blackthorne\">Kitty Blackthorne</a>. After a family meeting where she denied being in a relationship with anyone Dawn flies to the apartment of her secret lover that is revealed [to the readers] to be <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5203\" href=\"/celeste-noble/4005-5203/\" slug=\"celeste-noble\">Celeste Noble</a>. She was out one night with an acquaintance and met Celeste and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5206\" href=\"/frost/4005-5206/\" slug=\"frost\">Frost</a>. Dawn is immediately attracted to the beautiful Celeste and after getting her number contacts her and asks her on a shopping date. Celeste agrees as she has very few friends and the two spend the day together shopping.</p><p>After their spree is over Dawn works up the nerve to kiss Celeste but is immediately rejected. Dawn is later surprised to find Celeste Noble once again at her doorstep and is very surprised when Celeste kisses her. The two begin their secret lesbian love affair spending time with one another as they can. Dawn does not like the fact that she has to share her lover with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55524\" href=\"/the-noble-family/4060-55524/\" slug=\"the-noble-family\">Noble Family</a> one bit. They constantly seem to drag her into their business despite the fact that Celeste and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5200\" href=\"/rusty-noble/4005-5200/\" slug=\"rusty-noble\">Rusty Noble</a> are divorced. She also does not like that Frost calls her quite often, but Celeste turns him down most of the time.</p><p>Dawn concocts a plan to split Celeste from the Nobles but it never comes to fruition as Celeste kills her mother after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55629\" href=\"/kitty-blackthorne/4005-55629/\" slug=\"kitty-blackthorne\">Kitty Blackthorne</a> begs her to end her life. Kitty was a shape shifter that is losing control of her animal persona every time she changed. It is hinted that Dawn may have divulged her clandestine relationship with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5203\" href=\"/celeste-noble/4005-5203/\" slug=\"celeste-noble\">Celeste Noble</a> to Kitty but the later does not state this for sure. Dawn arrived just as Celeste decapitates her mother much to Dawn's horror. It is only after the deed is done that Celeste learned that there was a cure for Kitty's condition, but was not aware of this before she died as Kitty herself explained there was no cure. This event terminates Celeste &amp; Dawn's relationship.</p><p>The Nobles and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55626\" href=\"/the-blackthornes/4060-55626/\" slug=\"the-blackthornes\">Blackthornes</a> engage in a fight at the funeral after Celeste arrives to try and pay her respects.</p><h2>Powers:</h2><p>Dawn, like her name implies, the power to emit light, beams of light energy and can fly.</p>",
