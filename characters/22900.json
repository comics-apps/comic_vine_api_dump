    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2><p>Steel Wind used to be a gentle woman from Japan that loved to capture beauty's essence in her paintings. An accidental explosion on board a cruise ship left her near death but she managed to wash ashore a nearby Caribbean isle. Her arms and body horrifically damaged, a mysterious benefactor named <a href=\"/freakmaster/4005-85655/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85655\">Freakmaster</a>, with a team of advanced surgeons replaced her arms with cybernetic parts. She vowed to stay loyal to the man responsible for reconstructing her body.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Steel Wind first appeared in <a href=\"/ghost-rider/4050-2636/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2636\">Ghost Rider</a> #75 in December 1982 and was created by <a href=\"/jm-dematteis/4040-41043/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41043\">JM DeMatteis</a> and <a href=\"/bob-budiansky/4040-10224/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-10224\">Bob Budiansky</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><h3>Contest</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/478685-wi3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-478685\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"2.28\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:228.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/478685-wi3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-478685\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/478685-wi3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/478685-wi3.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></a></figure><p>Steel Wind arrives on a motorcycle at a circus owned by a man named Quentin. Quentin tells <a href=\"/johnny-blaze/4005-6108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6108\">Johnny Blaze</a>, who is employed there as a motorcycle stunt driver, that he is going to be replaced by Steel Wind. Members of the circus oppose the idea and Quentin decides that a contest will take place between Steel Wind and Johnny Blaze. Steel Wind ends up winning the race and Johnny leaves the circus. Steel Wind is cold and distant towards everyone at the circus. A circus performer named Vincenzo wants to know more about Steel Wind and enters her tent. He is in shock when he sees Steel Wind without her gloves. Her arms are metallic meshed with pieces of flesh. Steel Wind walks towards Vincenzo and kills him. Members of the circus begin to hate Steel Wind and confront Quentin about her. Steel Wind arrives on her bike and confronts the crowd. She tells Quentin that he is weak and that she is going to take charge. She warned if anyone plans to cross her, they will suffer and pay a great price. She drives off and suddenly sees Johnny Blaze. He tells Steel Wind that these people stood up for him and now he is returning the favor. </p><p>Steel Wind attacks Johnny Blaze and shoots laser beams from her cycle towards him. A chase ensues and Steel Wind emits a burst of flame from her cycle where it consumes Johnny Blaze. Blaze then transforms into <a href=\"/ghost-rider/4005-4268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4268\">Ghost Rider</a> and continues the fight. Steel Wind manages to knock Ghost Rider onto the ground and then two wires from her hands connect to the cycle's handlebars. She fires two wire-guided grenades towards Ghost Rider and he takes the shattering blast. Ghost Rider then grabs Steel Wind's cycle with his chain and tosses it towards a tree while she is still attached to the handle bars. Steel Wind disentangles herself from the circuitry revealing her cybernetic side. Ghost Rider grabs Steel Wind and lets the hellfire take her body as it burns deeply into her soul. Later, Steel Wind's sister enlisted the help of <a href=\"/centurious/4005-14757/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14757\">Centurious</a> and <a href=\"/reverend-styge/4005-14790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14790\">Reverend Styge </a>to revive her from her comatose state. However, in repayment for doing so they transformed her sister into a cyborg as well, naming her <a href=\"/steel-vengeance/4005-74819/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74819\">Steel Vengeance</a>. Steel Wind was also seen as a member of <a href=\"/superia/4005-25690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25690\">Superia</a>'s <a href=\"/femizons/4060-40960/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40960\">Femizons</a> when they tried to capture <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"/paladin/4005-10584/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10584\">Paladin</a> to stop them messing up Superia's plan to sterilize the rest of the world's females. After Superia is defeated, Steel Wind and <a href=\"/battleaxe/4005-28854/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28854\">Battleaxe</a> track down ex-Femizons <a href=\"/asp/4005-28880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28880\">Asp</a> and <a href=\"/black-mamba/4005-30719/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30719\">Black Mamba</a> at The Bar in New York for a bounty but are defeated.</p><h3>Spirits of Vengeance </h3><p>Returning to the scene of her original crimes, Steel Wind and Steel Vengeance show up at Quentin's Carnival again, where they battle Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. When Blaze and Ghost Rider are teleported away by <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a>, Centurious kills Steel Vengeance for failing to capture them. Steel Wind is sent back to the Carnival again, this time with a horde of summoned demons. During the battle, <a href=\"/vengeance/4005-14759/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14759\">Vengeance</a> (sent by Mephisto) and Johnny Blaze blow off both her arms before a carnival employee Miranda Woods releases an energy blast that incinerates the demons and appears to kill Steel Wind.</p><p>Somehow Steel Wind returns again alongside Centurious and with the <a href=\"/lilin/4060-26662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26662\">Lilin</a> she attacks Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze at the Carnival in a plan to gain the Medallion of Power for Centurious. Defeated again, Lilin and Steel Wind escape through a rift in space. Johnny Blaze later happens upon Steel Wind, missing both her arms, being held at a military base in the Adirondacks. Believing that she can still be redeemed, he refuses her pleas to kill her and takes her back to the Carnival with him where they rebuild her cyborg body. Now allied with Johnny Blaze, Steel Wind helps him defeat Centurious. Johnny stops her from killing Centurious and she rides away, although when she's gone he does the deed himself. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Steel Wind has a degree of superhuman strength because of her cybernetic parts. She is also a talented motorcycle rider. Her motorcycle is equipped with a flame thrower, laser beams, wire-guided grenades and the exhaust pipes can emit a powerful wind vortex. </p><p><b>Physical Characteristics</b></p><p>Height: 5' 9\" </p><p>Weight: 130 lbs </p><p>Hair: Magenta with a white steak</p><p>Eyes: Red </p>",

    "deck": "Walker is an alien death god, infatuated with Mistress Death. When Death spurned his advances, he decided to destroy her.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Walker or his other name known as He-Who-Walks-Across-The-Worlds-Of-Life-And-Death-Like-A-Colossus. Walker was the Death God from a distance galaxy, and unlike our galaxy, he was the only death god there. He eventually came to meet mistress <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a> of our own galaxy and they even had a relationship while she was going out with <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\"> Thanos</a> the Titan. Eventually Walker gave Death the ultimate death, killing every living being in his galaxy. She turned him down at first, the feelings of Walker were sadness and despair. Those emotions turned to anger and hate as he went on his pursuit after Death to seek his revenge. Walker then absorbed the trillions upon trillions of souls he had destroyed. Death eventually talked to Thanos and took his advice and hid in the body of Marlo Jones, a mortal woman. Eventually Marlo and <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Marvel</a> were in a clothing store and that’s where Walker had been and Marvel sensed Walker was evil. This lead him to tell Marlo to as he tried to grab Walker's staff, but it was too cold. Walker explained it to be and extension of himself and it was as cold as death itself.</p><p>Eventually <a href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\"> Rick Jones</a> pushed the jeans rack on Walker and ran out the store. When Walker followed them out of the store, there he met Thanos and they battled. Thanos threw a blast at Walker, as Walker put up a shield with his staff and then took his sunglasses off to fire an eye beam at Thanos. This beam caused Thanos to scream in pain leaving the titan on his knees in a small crater. Captain Marvel soon arrived to shoot powerful blasts at the two, though it did no damage to either of them. Becasue of the ineffectiveness of Marvel's attack, Walker said that Thanos was allying himself with weak people and that he was probably absorbing energy from his ship somewhere. They got another attack from Walker, and he threatened them to reveal her (Death) location or he will take the planet Earth down, molecule by molecule. Walker would then release and attack, destroying the area around him and knocking Thanos and Captain Marvel even further back from their distance. As they talk they return fire, but it does them no good on Walker. A streak of lighting is seen as it came down on Walker coming from the god of thunder himself as he landed and challenged Walker. While <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\"> Captain Marvel</a> tried to warn <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\"> Thor</a> of Walker's power. Then all three, Thanos, Thor and Captain Marvel release an attack at Walker,so strong that it banished him. The three hero’s and Marlo with Death inside her teleported to Thanos' ship. There Thanos explained to Marlo that she was also <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\"> Death</a> herself and that Death took refuge inside her. Then Walker came back into view in his ship behind Thanos' ship, even dwarfing Thanos' own ship. Walker's ship was several miles long and Captain Marvel remarked how it was probably big enough to eat Cleveland.</p><p>Thor and Captain Marvel listen to Thanos' orders to put their powers together, and as they did, Thanos utilized it to teleport the four to a pocket dimension.</p><p>They ended up in the dimension of purgatory. The three hero’s and two girls had teleported as Walker teleported himself to the dimension as well and as he did he instantly attacked Death. He tried to kill her, but he instead took the full blasts of Thanos, Captain Marvel, and Thor, knocking him back, though he came out unharmed. He then easily defeats Thanos and Thor with a blast from his staff. Walker then traps Thanos, Thor, and Captain Marvel in force block. Death then remembers when Thanos explains of how death had no domain in that dimension. Walker then teleports behind Death and explains she can end this if she gives in now, then shows her how he already has the heroes in small shields they were trapped in. He then releases Captain Marvel as he went to attack Walker but Thor screamed him not to but he went along with it anyway and grabbed Walker's staff. As he did, Walker tricked him and made him slam his bands together turning him back to Rick. Rick thought he couldn’t be changed back in another dimension but Walker explained this dimension is basically every place at once He then blasts at Ricks arm freezing it solid. As he told Death to beg, Rick yelled at her not to beg to a guy such as Walker, then Walker swung his staff and broke Ricks ice arm leaving Rick screaming in pain. Mistress Death then summons many spirits from the dimension of purgatory and they all form into Asgard warriors that died from a disease during the time the Fernis Wolf was alive.</p><p>He then gets hit by Lorraine and blasts her with a blast so hard that she is deleted from existence. Then the spirits that Death summoned came and attacked Walker, jumping him while he was distracted. Thor and Thanos got free from their holding while Walker let out a strong blast killing the asgardian warriors, one being one of Thor's old close friends. He then uses his power and starts aging Rick, making him get older by the second. Eventually this is too much for mistress Death to take as she put her hand inside Walker. Thanos then explained to him that Death has no feeling but with her in a human body she had a breaking point, which Walker had reached. He also explained he was never really a threat to Death as well. Walker then said that Death has no domain and Thanos explains back that Death isn’t going to kill him, but set the trillions of souls free he absorbed. The souls are then set free as Walker was left as bones that dropped to the floor.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>Walker has vast strength on a cosmic scale. He has amazing cosmic/mystical manipulating powers which can be used to fire devastating blasts even from his eyes or making shields or just firing blasts. He’s very invulnerable on a high scale, enabling him to take hits from Thanos (while absorbing power from his ship), Captain Genesis Marvel and Thor with out sustaining injury. Also as a death god he is immortal. Walker was powered by the anger and hate of the beings in his galaxy and was feared by them all. He also owns an indestructible staff that looks wooden and a ship several miles long that came with some huge weapons around it. His ship was made of skulls. He also had unlimited strength due to the amount of hatred and souls he had absorbed. He can also control small pocket dimensions. He can also teleport. With all his great vast power it’s said he could do any feat he desired.</p>",

Vincent Carraciola,  the leader of the crime family who took her daughter, blackmails her to  become their assassin. If she refuses to assassinate her targets, then  Carraciola says they'll kill her daughter.</p> <h3>Legend of Suspiria</h3> <p>Some  believe her to not be a real person, just an Italian hit-man fairy  tale. She’s been called the “Boogeyman of Messina.” It is believed that  several stories are passed around the Italian mafia families make her  out to be a deadly assassin mixed in with and some sexual fantasies.</p> <p>While  working for Carraciola, Suspiria assassinated the Camorra family heads  from Naples when they tried to take over the Napolitano wine business.  While working for Vincent Carraciola, she is on a strict retainer and  isn't supposed to leave Italy or take outside jobs.</p><br/><h2>Creation </h2>Suspiria was created by  <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3068\" href=\"/jimmy-palmiotti/4040-3068/\" slug=\"jimmy-palmiotti\">            Jimmy Palmiotti</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42109\" href=\"/justin-gray/4040-42109/\" slug=\"justin-gray\">            Justin Gray</a>.  <br/><br/><h2>Character Evolution<br/></h2> When Suspiria first appeared, she was hired to kill the Punisher. That job ended with the Punisher throwing her off the top of a building and presumed she was dead. Later, she returns to New York City and convinces the Punisher to assist her and return to Italy to take down the people who kidnapped an American senator's son. <br/><br/><h3>Romantic Encounters </h3> In the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-30745\" href=\"/punisher-bloody-valentine/4050-30745/\" slug=\"punisher-bloody-valentine\">            Punisher: Bloody Valentine</a>,  Suspiria and Frank Castle become romantically involved. They bond over  similar circumstances of loosing their families and loved ones.  <br/><br/><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><br/><h3>The Punisher: Red X-Mas</h3> <p>A few days prior to Christmas, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\" href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" slug=\"punisher\">            Punisher</a>, dressed as Santa Clause, kills five Napolitano family men walking outside of Tiffany's &amp; Co in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\" href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" slug=\"new-york-city\">            New York City</a>. The death of Regina Napolitano's husband makes her third husband to die at the hands of the Punisher. On Christmas Eve, Regina concocts a plan requiring $500,000 from each of the five widows to hire Suspiria, her cousin, for a total of 2 million. At first the other women are hesitant, but they are eventually convinced to hire her to kill the Punisher. <br/> <br/>On New Year's Eve, Suspiria sends a video to the police stating she has planted explosives under the streets of Times Square and will detonate the bombs if anything happens to her. She also makes a demand for the Punisher to show up in Times Square or else she will kill a civilian every two minutes until he does show up. She then shoots at least eight civilians before the Punisher arrives.</p> <p>The Punisher locates who he believes to be Suspiria on top of a building with a high-powered rifle. After shooting her with his sniper rifle, the woman falls to the ground. Looking over the dead woman, the police discover that this woman was wearing a wig and was not Italian.</p> <p>Suspiria uses this decoy locate the Punisher and follow him back to a hotel room. Breaking down the door just after midnight, they get into a confrontation. During the fight, she takes Frank off guard by kissing him and then as he's surprised, she bites into his shoulder to break free of his grapple.</p> <p>As Punisher escapes via the fire escape, Suspiria follows after him. Suspiria spots an open window and as she is crawling into the apartment, the Punisher reveals his hidden location and closes the window on her with one of her legs trapped outside. With her stuck in the window entrance, the Punisher shoots her leg, binds her, and then brings her back to his headquarters.</p> <p>As Frank is interrogating her, she offers to tell him who hired her in exchange for a kiss. The next morning, Frank throws Suspiria off the top of a building to land on Regina Napolitano's (the person who hired her) car.</p> <h3>The Punisher: Bloody Valentine</h3> <p>Suspiria spent nine months learning to walk again after she the failed Punisher assassination job. About a year later, she returns to New York City. While taking down some arms dealers bringing guns into the city, she runs into the Punisher. Suspiria convinces the Punisher to go with her to Italy and informs him that she's working to find a Senator's kidnapped son. The kidnappers were using the kid as leverage to bring weapons into the city without being caught. The leader of the kidnappers and arms dealers is revealed to be <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67325\" href=\"/herman-the-german/4005-67325/\" slug=\"herman-the-german\">            Herman the German</a>.</p> <p>Once they arrive at her home in Italy, her former boss, Vincent Carraciola, sends a team after her. He believed that she had switched sides or taken another employer after leaving the country to take a job for her cousin (to kill the Punisher) and the following nine months of rehabilitation where she was away from him.</p> <p>Suspiria and the Punisher disguise themselves as Mr. and Mrs. Joe Delfini to infiltrate a casino where Vincent Carraciola is playing poker. After a fire fight in the main lobby, they burst into the private room where Carraciola says he killed Suspiria's daughter when she left the country last year (her assignation job to kill the Punisher). After Suspria interrogates Carraciola, she kills him with her knife. The two then leave the casino to chase after Herman the German who was also working with Carraciola.</p> <p>They arrive at the airport and board Herman the German's plane to find nineteen handcuffed kids. Just as the Punisher is about to squeeze the trigger and kill Herman, Suspiria knocks him out to prevent the kids from watching the scene. Herman informs Suspiria that her daughter is alive and was sold to a family in Hamburg, Germany.</p> <p>After flying the plane back to New York to return the children into the hands of the U.N. so they can be returned to their families and return the senator’s son, the Italian government pardons Suspiria for all of her assassinations she performed while being blackmailed by Carraciola. In return for the pardon, the Italian government requires her to work for them as a government operative. <br/></p> <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2> <p>Suspiria does not possess any super powers.

    "description": "<p>Grew up with Carl Lucas, now known as <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, and together helped one another to survive. Between the two, Carl had the hands and Willis had blades, and with these expert skills they ran a life of small time crime. Eventually Carl would grow tired of the dishonest life and get a small job, but Willis was just getting started. Willis eventually attempted to move in on <a href=\"/maggia/4060-26082/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26082\">mob</a> territory.</p><p>Carl and Willis were still good friends despite their different turns in life, but all that changed over a woman named <a href=\"/reva-connors/4005-11614/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11614\">Reva</a>. She liked both men, but would come to love Carl. Stricken with paranoia and jealousy, Willis contemplated revenge on his old friend for stealing his girl. Willis framed Carl for narcotic charges, and Reva went back to him since her true love was in prison. As it turns out Willis stole the narcotics from the <a href=\"/maggia/4060-26082/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26082\">Maggia</a>, a big time mob syndicate. They came after Willis, but ended up only killing Reva in the crossfire.</p><p>Years later and Willis was getting closer to the top of organized crime, and now went by the alias of Diamondback. Carl broke out of jail after undergoing a special experiment that left him with steel-hard skin. Now going by Luke Cage, Carl sought revenge on Willis for getting Reva killed and to clear his own name.</p><p>In a climactic fight, Diamondback killed himself by accident with his own exploding knife. Willis fell through a skylight window and landed with his knife next him. The blade exploded as it hit the ground, and just as he got a false sense of safety too.</p><p>He had a henchman named the <a href=\"/gadget/4005-33987/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33987\">Gadget Man</a> who made all his special knives for him.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Willis Stryker, a.k.a.

He informs Cottonmouth that he can either pay a ridiculously high price for the ammo, or ask Diamondback to kill Cage himself, with the latter option requiring Cottonmouth forfeit his territory. </p><p>When Cottonmouth is killed by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/black-mariah/4005-55895/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55895\">his cousin,</a> Diamondback travels to Harlem to kill Cage. He manages to wound him, but the hero escapes. As the series progresses, it's revealed that Willis is not only Luke's childhood friend from back in Georgia, but also his illegitimate half-brother as well. Their father was the town's popular preacher, and he secretly had an affair with Willis' mother. Though Luke and Willis were close as children, their friendship ended when the two of them were arrested. Luke was able to avoid jail time by serving in the military, while Willis was given a lengthy sentence, with the boys' father refusing to help him. This caused Willis to develop a bitter hatred towards Luke, which only worsened when his mother died while he was in prison. This version of Willis is effectively combined with <a href=\"/coldfire/4005-3140/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3140\">James Lucas Jr./Coldfire</a>, Luke's brother from the comics.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5473606-4843549251-diamo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5473606\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"618\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 618px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5473606-4843549251-diamo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5473606\"><img alt=\"Diamondback's Hammer Industries suit\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5473606-4843549251-diamo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5473606-4843549251-diamo.jpg 618w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5473606-4843549251-diamo.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Diamondback's Hammer Industries suit</figcaption></figure><p>Once in control of Cottonmouth's territory, Diamondback sets out to ruin Luke's reputation by framing him for the murder of a police officer.

    "deck": "A freelance mercenary, Mark Hazzard is a West Point graduate with years of combat experience, ranging from his time in Vietnam to his stint as the leader of a hard core mercenary shop. A principled fellow, he's made many enemies in his field over the years.",
    "description": "<p>Mark Hazzard grew up in a rather cold, heartless family. His father always wanted him to be the best at everything he did. While he did rather well in everything he tried, such as football, he was never good enough in his father's eyes, and Mark's father couldn't tolerate this. All the way through military school, at West Point, this 'tradition' of disappointment continued. </p><p> <br/>Events came to a head, however, when Mark's father decided that the woman he loved, the woman he was going to marry, also wasn't good enough for a Hazzard man. That was the last straw, and with that Mark got married, quit West Point, and signed up for several tours in Vietnam (as that conflict was raging at the time). </p><p>During this tours of duty, Mark put his extensive military skills into play, doing all sorts of tricky missions for the U.S. military. Patrols, seek and destroy missions, and even the occasional stint as a tunnel rat were all a part of Mark's work, and he enjoyed it thoroughly. In fact, his three tours in 'Nam helped to form his vast military theory into impressive practical experience. </p><p>Also, Mark assembled a vast array of friends, contacts, and favors to be called in at a future date, as he was about the best there is at what he did, and he often pulled less skilled people's fat out of the proverbial fire. Eventually, though, the war was over, and Mark was shipped home. He couldn't get a job, though, in that nobody would hire vets, so he turned to mercenary work. </p><p>At first, Mark simply served as one of many fighting men in a mercenary company, but over time, Mark grew into a leader of such men, and formed his own merc crew. This crew included such rough and tumble fellows as Mal Rossi and Louis 'Treetop' Barrington. This three man crew grew to include lots of other occasional, part-time help, and their reputation grew. </p><p>Eventually, however, Mark's marriage went bad, namely because his wife forced him to choose between her and his work, and they eventually got divorced. Her new husband, a slime-ball lawyer named Gordon (last name unrevealed), never got on too well with Mark, always feeling that his wife and step-son liked Hazzard more than they liked him - and, of course, it was true. </p><p>As such, Gordon eventually set up Mark to die while on a mission in Iran, hoping he would disappear in that godforsaken desert once and for all. Mark's friends mounted a rescue to save him, and once he got back, Hazzard learned who was behind all of this mess - thanks to some leg-work done by his pal Lincoln Griffin. After dealing with the middle man, one Henri Graymalkin, Mark went after Gordon. </p><p>Already wounded from his encounter with Graymalkin, Hazzard was just slow enough that Gordon managed to plug him several times before Mark bore down on him, strangling him with his bare hands. Though he had finally gotten rid of his unknown enemy, the damage was done, and Mark collapsed in a heap of his own blood. </p><p>Taken to the hospital immediately, Mark nonetheless was too far gone by the time he'd gotten there, and after a long and arduous operation, Mark was effectively dead, being kept alive only by the hospital's life-saving machinery. Scott, Mark's son, told the doctors to turn the machines off, thinking that Hazzard would want things that way, and as such, the doctors let him die, ending Mark Hazzard's tale. </p>",

    "deck": "Garko was a man who transformed into a giant frog monster after drinking a jar of mysterious juice so that he could conquer the world.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>When Garko was first introduced, he was merely a peculiar man who was seen sitting on the fourth-floor ledge of an apartment in Cleveland, Ohio. It was stated that he'd sat there for days on end staring at a jar of juice he held, and occasionally shouting \"I'm gonna conquer the world! You hear me?\" As it turned out, Garko had been trying to decide on whether or not to drink the juice and use its power to conquer the world. At first he wasn't really sure if he really wanted to conquer the world, but he eventually decided it would be worth it since it would allow him to get rid of his enemies. Drinking the juice, Garko was transformed into the monstrous Garko the Man-Frog.  <br/>It was never revealed just what Garko's juice was, how he'd acquired it, or just who his supposed enemies were.<br/><h2>Creation </h2>Garko was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41456\" href=\"/steve-gerber/4040-41456/\" slug=\"steve-gerber\">    Steve Gerber</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-15962\" href=\"/frank-brunner/4040-15962/\" slug=\"frank-brunner\">   Frank Brunner</a>. <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs  <br/></h2><h3>Frog Death! <br/></h3>After becoming the Man-Frog, Garko went on a brief rampage through Cleveland before coming afoul of an enraged <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6803\" href=\"/howard-the-duck/4005-6803/\" slug=\"howard-the-duck\">  Howard the Duck</a>, who proceeded to whack him with a board with a nail in it. It was at that time that the effects of the juice that had transformed Garko went into overdrive, causing him to shrink and turn into a regular, harmless frog. Some police officers then arrived and arrested Howard the Duck, mistaking him for the rampaging humanoid animal that had been reported, and unwittingly ran over Garko the frog with their car.<br/><h3>Creator's Rights</h3>Garko (in his human form) was last seen in a bar in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\" href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" slug=\"hell\"> Hell</a> where Howard the Duck had a few drinks with God. <br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>As the Man-Frog, Garko was a creature of considerable size and strength, proving able to easily crush a car. He also possessed considerable leaping abilities due to his frog nature. These abilities of Garko were short-lived however, as he became a regular frog only a few minutes or so after transforming into the Man-Frog.",

    "deck": "An ex-Navy Seal who became a member of Cyberdata, but was eventually freed and became the leader of Cyberforce.",
    "description": "<h2>Cyberdata</h2><p>After his time as a Navy Seal Dylan was brought into <a data-ref-id=\"4060-51776\" href=\"/cyberdata/4060-51776/\">Cyberdata</a> and they implanted one of their brainboxes to control him. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59294\" href=\"/doctor-corben/4005-59294/\">Doctor Corben</a> started to notice his aggression increasing. This led him to finding the device. Corben removed them from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21923\" href=\"/stryker/4005-21923/\">Stryker</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-24467\" href=\"/cyblade/4005-24467/\">Cyblade</a>, and Dylan first and they became the original <a data-ref-id=\"4060-25321\" href=\"/cyberforce/4060-25321/\">Cyberforce</a>. Later new members joined and Dylan became the team leader.</p><h2>Cyberforce</h2><p>One of the earliest missions of Cyberforce was to rescue a mutant girl dubbed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9151\" href=\"/velocity/4005-9151/\">Velocity</a> from the clutches of Cyberdata. Heatwave saved her multiple times and a love/hate relationship between him and enemy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52086\" href=\"/killjoy/4005-52086/\">Killjoy</a> was developed. Eventually Velocity escaped and joined the team.</p><p>After saving Velocity the team was a little disheveled. Their original base had been destroyed and they had to train Velocity and try and get her sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41824\" href=\"/ballistic/4005-41824/\">Ballistic</a> to join them. One day while Velocity was training <a data-ref-id=\"4005-26501\" href=\"/ripclaw/4005-26501/\">Ripclaw</a> interfered and Heatwave had to take him down,showing one of the earliest signs of leadership. A relationship with Cyblade was also starting to develop.</p><p>Cyberforce's next mission brought them in the path of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-25113\" href=\"/wildcats/4060-25113/\">WildC.A.T.s</a> and it involved the heroes <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12014\" href=\"/warblade/4005-12014/\">Warblade</a> and Ripclaw and the S.H.O.C. agent <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40879\" href=\"/misery/4005-40879/\">Misery</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4060-25321\" href=\"/cyberforce/4060-25321/\">Cyberforce</a> was brainwashed by Misery into attacking the other team. Heatwave fought with WildC.A.T. leader <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12006\" href=\"/spartan/4005-12006/\">Spartan</a> and managed to nearly defeat him before he regained control in time to stop Velocity from killing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11586\" href=\"/zealot/4005-11586/\">Zealot</a>. The teams left on good terms.</p><p>During the events of the Devil's Reign company crossover between Top Cow and <a data-ref-id=\"4010-31\" href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\">Marvel</a>, Heatwave was seduced into becoming <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\" href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\">Mephisto</a>'s lieutenant. As his downward spiral progressed, he came into conflict with his fellow members of CyberForce. They were finally able to break through to him, and he sacrificed his life to stop Mephisto's designs. The members of CyberForce held a memorial, honoring him as a friend and a hero.</p><p>In 2006 the CyberForce title was relaunched, and over the course of the 6 issue mini series it was found that Dylan had been resurrected by the alien ship that had crashed to Earth millennia ago. The race of beings aboard that ship provided the original material for creating metahumans such as CyberForce and the members of Cyberdata's S.H.O.C. teams. Heatwave led a defense against the return of these beings, who were bent on destroying Earth as they considered the existence of metahumans an obscenity to their race. CyberForce was able to repel the aliens, but not without the loss of one of their own, Impact.</p><p>During the CyberForce/Hunter Killer crossover, Heatwave was critically injured during the first attack. Only the quick thinking of previous <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40992\" href=\"/hunter-killer/4060-40992/\">Hunter-Killer</a> member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40980\" href=\"/ellis/4005-40980/\">Ellis</a> were they able to save his life. Velocity was infected with the Ultra-Sapien strain, making her susceptible to control by Cyberdata via her JETT communications device. As a safeguard to keep an eye on the Hunter Killers, Heatwave decided to join their team to help balance the scales of their losses from the battle with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41087\" href=\"/morningstar/4005-41087/\">Morningstar</a>. Ellis joined CyberForce to help keep velocity in check should the dormant virus reactivate.</p><h2>Stryker</h2><p>Over the course of their teamwork <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21923\" href=\"/stryker/4005-21923/\">Stryker</a> and Heatwave have come into conflict many times. Being that Heatwave is a straight shooting military man and Stryker is a guerilla fighter has brought into conflict on leading the team, but what annoyed Heatwave the most was Stryker's double life, while he was with Cyberforce he was also leading the mercenary team Stryke Force, eventually Stryker admitted his faults to Dylan and disbanded the team.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Arides is the result of a <a href=\"/kree-empire/4060-7588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\">Kree</a> project for the creation of super-soldiers. Born to scientists Falzon (father) and Murius (mother), Arides was trained since infancy by the <a href=\"/supreme-intelligence/4005-6096/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6096\">Supreme Intelligence.</a> He was subject to treatment with photo-masons for twenty years, granting him energy powers. His green beam could paralyze enemies, his red beam produced great amounts of heat and his yellow beam was used for concussive effects.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Arides is a <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel comics</a> character created by <a href=\"/doug-moench/4040-42016/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42016\">Doug Moench</a> and <a href=\"/george-perez/4040-2913/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2913\">George Perez.</a> The character first appearing in Inhumans #3 released in 1976.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Inhumans</h3><p>His first mission was to capture his parents who were attempting to flee <a href=\"/hala/4020-56002/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56002\">Hala</a>, disillusioned with the treatment of their son by the military. He captured his father and killed his mother.</p><p>He was later sent on Earth to capture the Inhumans to acquire their services for the Kree military. He was outfited with a battle armor and a jet pack. His wrist bands helped him focus his energy beams. In subsequent battles Arides was presumed kiled when Triton deflected his beams back at him. While the beams did end his existance as a being of flesh and blood, Arides was not dead. He emerged much later as an energy being. He could project heat, light and concussive force at will. He could fly at the speed of light. Energy attacks could harm him as they disrupted his control over his own energies. Initially he wanted to continue with his original mission but when realizing that he was no longer conventionally alive, Arides departed for Hala. He hoped that someone would give him answers concerning his new state of being.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Arides possesses superhuman levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability and energy projection. Skilled and proficient in multiple martial arts Arides is a formidable hand to hand fighter. Arides also possesses the ability to generate and project light, heat and concussive force to powerful levels and effect. In his humanoid form Arides would utilize an armor and jet pack to fly and to channel his powers. In his energy form, neither of these were required, although Arides would use a headband to help maintain stability and physical cohesion.</p><p> </p><p><b>Physical Characteristics</b></p><p>Height: 5' 9\"</p><p>Weight: 19b lbs</p><p>Hair: Black</p><p>Eyes: Amber</p>",

In order to succeed however, Monica also ended up restarting <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M's</a> \"Captain Universe Initiative\", a project designed for the purpose of capturing The Uni-Power and using its power to create an army of Uni-Powered Super-Soldiers. Through the use of a holographic hardlight \"everywoman in crisis\" program, lured <a href=\"/uni-power/4015-44362/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44362\">The Uni-Power</a> of <a href=\"/captain-universe/4005-27193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27193\">Captain Universe</a> into several data-gathering traps. Traps which had given her more than enough data on The Uni-Power to create an artificial variant of it called Uni-Alias. The project was finished over 100 years later when Monica's granddaughter Varina Goddard empowered the Death's Head 3.0 unit with The Uni-Alias and ordered him to kill The United Nations Secretary General Okuda.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-129060\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/129060-169745-death-s-head-3-0.jpg\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.53\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/129060-169745-death-s-head-3-0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-129060\"><img alt=\" Varina Goddard\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/129060-169745-death-s-head-3-0.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/129060-169745-death-s-head-3-0.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"></a><figcaption> Varina Goddard</figcaption></figure><p>Despite being under Varina's influence, the core of Death's Head 3.0 very being was subtly being altered from within by The Uni-Alias.</p><p>Thus did Death's Head mimic its actions and sought to empower the disempowered and unfetter that which was caged within.</p><p>However, he did not come to realize this until the leader of a great revolution whom Death's Head 3.0 had decided to free from the Nu Grazi prison complex instead of the criminal scientist Varina had ordered him to save, was killed by a bullet that had been deflected off of Death's Head's armor.</p><p>Believing all roads to redemption now forever closed to him because of his actions, Death's Head 3.0 fell into darkness and tore the Nu Grazi complex asunder.</p><p>But, as it would later turn out, he was wrong in thinking that redemption was lost to him.

    "description": "<p>Lrrr is the ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8, a planet located about 1000 light years away from earth, allowing them to watch TV shows from our time. When Fry knocked out a Fox broadcasting station back in the 20th century, this resulted in the disruption of the Omicronians signal, prompting an invasion of earth, and the first appearance of Lrrr, and his wife Ndnd. Their demands were that they get \"MacNeal\", the show they were watching (A spoof on the real Fox show Ali McBeal) or they will raise the temperature of the earth by one billion degrees each day. Zapp Branigan delivered them instead President MacNeal, not knowing they simply wanted to see the end of the show. Fry's TV watching ended up saving the day by making up an ending to the show, as he had been watching it, thus diverting the attack from Lrrr. Lrrr was also seen watching \"Friends\", and wondered why the largest one, Ross, doesn't eat the others.</p><p>A second invasion from Lrrr was prompted when the Planet Express crew unknowingly stumbled upon their nursery planet, and discovered what they called \"Popplers\". These turned out to be young Omicronians, and Lrrr demanded that for each of their young that was eaten, they will eat one human. It was eventually negotiated that he just eat Leela, the one that \"discovered\" the Popplers, however after being convinced by a young Omicronian who thought of Leela as it's mother, he was fine with just eating the hippy, Free Waterfall Jr. instead, which then resulted in him becoming stoned. </p><p>A third invasion of earth was prompted on Valentines Day when the Planet Express crew delivered a peace offering of candy hearts. Lrrr found the hearts chalky, and when he found a heart saying \"I wuv you\" he was both confused and infuriated by this concept of wuv, because surely it meant love.</p><p>Lrrr also had bought Fry's nose, or Human Horn on the black market as an aphrodisiac in an attempt to save his marriage to Ndnd. It's revealed by Ndnd that Lrrr has a sensitive side, which she fell in love with after he had cried and nursed a bunny back to health after he had accidentally stepped on it. While attempting to harvest Fry's \"lower horn\" instead of his nose, Lrrr saved Big Foot from a deranged park ranger, and realized that taking Fry's lower horn made him not much better than the ranger, thus rekindling the spark with Ndnd, showing the sensitive side she fell in love with.</p>",

If this is done enough times, the target may even become so frail that they simply cease to exist.  In order to reverse the process, Visimajoris must be incapacitated.  Visimajoris has also shown the ability to shoot magic energy bolts out of his hands or his many eyes.  When Dr. Strange attempted to go to the base of the Creators, Visimajoris was assigned to stopping him.  Visimajoris used his abilities to create 1,024 duplicates of Dr. Strange, each one being so distraught that they could not even move or think.  Visimajoris was about to finish off Dr. Strange when a star that was given human life by the Creators named Apalla flew forth and struck Visimajoris with a blast of her own.  Visimajoris was injured badly enough that Dr. Strange conglomerated back into his normal self and escaped.</p>",

    "description": "<p>History:</p><p>Iron was an orphan who is raised by The Order. Big Daddy later took him in, at the age of 12, and raises him in the Syndicate. Big Daddy comes to love Iron like a son.</p><p>Iron's first mission after going through the rOid 4.0 Super Soldier process was to deliver a message to Dr. Johnson. Johnson was planning to announce he would run for Governor, which Big Daddy wouldn't stand for. Johnson had hired a small army to protect him, and had his building locked down so tight it would take a tank to break in. Iron wipes out his army and breaks into the building without a problem. Johnson's first reponse on seeing Iron is commenting that the scientists he had worked with during the war had completed their dream of making the perfect soldier. Johnson then goes on to introduce Mr. Fong, who is there to protect him. Iron pulls what appears to be a rocket launcher, which instead just pops out Big Daddy's message: \"You can run but you can't hide!\", which is attacked to a rose. Dr. Johnson just laughs since his allergy to Roses isn't life threatening. As Iron pulls the rose out, a bee flies out and goes towards Johnson. Fong, who has sworn to saves Johnson's life in return for saving his granddaughter's, kills the bee; thus repaying his debt. Since Fong is no longer there to protect Johnson, Iron proceeds to cram the rose, with Big Daddy's message attached, into Johnson's mouth. Johnson announces his decision NOT to run for Governor the following day.</p><p>Iron is sent to inform Cardinal Kelvin, the High Priest of the Order, that if he doesn't stop preaching against Gambling, Iron will come back and kill him. Kelvin doesn't budge. As Iron leave the church Detective Manetti, Mayor Flaherty's right hand man, is there waiting to arrest him. Iron proceeds to kill all the cops, except Manetti who escapes, where by basically declaring war on City Hall.</p><p>When Iron returns to Big Daddy, Big Daddy is irate with him. Not only did he fail to get Kelvin to budge, he also declared war on City Hall, and now he's dripping blood on his rug. Iron informs Big Daddy that Kelvin claims he's just retaliating for Joey Petunia's \"tightening the screws\" on the Order. Iron is ordered to take Joey Petunia and Lester the Jester to collect the one million dollars that Chase owes Lester.</p><p>This routine collection turns into a double cross. Joey unloads lead on everyone, including Lester and Iron. Iron's right arm gets blown off and Joey leaves everyone for dead. Between Joey and Manetti it becomes widely accepted that Iron killed everyone at the \"collection\" and kidnapped Angel Chase.</p><p>Dr. Lubicus comes and finds Angel Chase injured and takes her into hiding so she can heal. Angel convinces Lubicus to save Iron as well, since he tried to save her family. Iron spends nearly 3 months in acoma, and wakes to find that Lubicus has given him and Iron right arm, since his has gotten blown off by Joey Petunia.</p><p>Iron finds that Angel has been working at the \"Baby Care Center\" Strip club, in hopes of finding information that will help he get revenge for her family's murder. Iron stops by her work and to start his hunt for revenge.</p><p>Iron's next stop is Giuseppe's, an Italian restaurant that has been a \"Safe zone\" for the syndicate for over 50 years. Chain Gang Charlie confronts him at the front door and Iron is forced to kill him and the two other members of his Chain Gang. Iron informs Big Daddy that he wants out, to which he responds \"The Syndicate is a Family! There is no membership. There is no Out.\" Big Daddy goes on to inform him that the only way he can redeem himself in the eyes of the Syndicate is to remedy his two previous failures. Convince Cardinal Kelvin to stop preaching about the \"so called sins\" of gambling, and to pay the one million dollars of Chase's bad debt that Iron had rendered \"noncollectable\". And he only has 48 hrs to do so.</p><p>Iron goes to get new clothes, and is confronted by Mickey Lightning: Master of Thor's Domain and Nick the Noose\" The on man lynch mob. They inform Iron that Big Daddy has given Joey 48 hrs to \"do business\" with Iron, and so Joey put 100 large on Iron's head.</p><p>Iron returns to Angel and Lubicus, where he finds that Lubicus has been furnishing weapons for both him and Angel. Lubicus and Angel surprise him for his 37th Birthday, with a cake... and a pair of \"Lubicus Specials\" which he specially designed for Iron.</p><p>Iron turns to Cardinal Kelvin and strikes a deal with the Order. Manetti follows Iron as he leaves the church and attempts to arrest him, and fails yet again.</p><p>Iron recruits his friend Mushmouth (Pony Moore) to help him out against the Syndicate.</p><p>Iron gets lured into a trap by Deadpan Louie and Drop Dead Mike and defeats them with the help of the Maiden.</p><p>Powers:</p><p>Iron is the first person to get, and survive rOid 4.0. rOid 4.0 gives Iron the strength, stamina, and endurance of 5 men. The rOid treatment is a carry-over from the Section 67B: Super Soldier program during the war. This program's goal was to create the perfect soldier by augmenting their abilities. Dr. Vonscrunting is one of the seven people involved in the Section 67B program and is the one who put Iron through level 4.0</p><p>Dr. Lubicus designed Iron's metal arm and tied it directly into his central nervous system, so Iron's body wouldn't know the difference. Lubicus also designed the two guns that Iron uses. They hold two 500 round clips and fire at twice the standard rate of fire. They are also equipped with a second barrel that fires a .45 caliber explosive round.</p><p>Iron is the first person known to survive rOid level 4.0, making him the strongest and most resilient man in history.... for now. rOid level 4.0 gave Iron the strength of 5 men, and allowed him to take the punishment of 5 men as well. This has lead to Michael Iron becoming known as the Syndicate's most capable and competent muscle. Frigg and Fragg have both been given 5.0, but have severe brain damage.</p>",

    "deck": "Arimathes is the \"future\" son of Hercules and the Emperor of the planet Wilamean.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Arimathes was born in the 24th century as the son of The Olympian God <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\" href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\">Hercules</a> and a young Wilamean girl named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-35542\" href=\"/layana-sweetwater/4005-35542/\">Layana Sweetwater</a>. Hercules met Layana at Port Anteris and had a brief but loving affair with her. He apparently left Layana not knowing she was pregnant and this not only infuriated her, as it would any woman, it changed her from a sweet and caring person into a hateful and vengefull shrew.</p><h2>The Emperor</h2><p>From his birth Layana knew Arimathes' divine heritage would grant him abilities far greater than any normal man or alien race in the known galaxy, so she raised him to be an Emperor. Backed by his mother's obssessive thirst for power and revenge and his own superhuman abilities, Arimathes rose quickly up the chain of command. By the time he was in his late 20's he had already built a vast empire which he ruled with fear and an iron fist. At some time in Arimathes' thirties Hercules happened upon his throne-world and was recognized immediately by his former love Layana. Over the years Layana had poisoned Arimathes' mind with untruths about his father, so that Arimathes loathed Hercules' very existence. Arimathes sent out a squadron of his best warriors to test Hercules mettle and they were, of course, bested with ease. Upon learning that his son was emperor and that he was loathed by him, Hercules was distraught. The fact that his son hated him was bad enough, but to add to it that he had become an egomaniacal emporer who ruled like a tyrant was more than Hercules could bare. Hercules decided that the only way to reach his son and have any chance of a possible reconcilliation was to humble him in battle.</p><h2>The Battle</h2><p>Hercules issued a public challenge to his son, a one on one hand to hand battle that was to take place on a desolate planet. Arimathes gladly and arrogantly accepted. Hercules realized that besting his son would be no easy task, but he needed not only to best him, but to humble him. So, once on the barren planet Hercules donned a blindfold and told Arimathes he could and would defeat him without the use of his sight. Arimathes was enraged, he thought no one could match his lordly might in a fair fight, much less one in which his opponent had a handicap.</p><p>Hercules insisted and the battle ensued. Hercules first punch sent Arimathes flying into a mountain-side. Arimathes, uninjured talked constantly, bragging of his abilities and his invincibility, \"I am invicible!! How can you resist my power?!\". He said as he lay in a pile of boulders. As he bragged, Hercules unerringly launched a massive boulder directly at his son. Arimathes quickly rose to his feet and obliterated the boulder before it could make impact. With blinding speed Arimathes picked up and hurled an enormous boulder of his own which landed directly on top of the blindfolded Hercules. Arimathes, thinking the battle over, decreed that anyone who stood against him would be destroyed just as his father had been! In mid boast the very ground beneath Arimathes feet erupted knocking him off of his feet. It was Hercules. Hercules goaded Arimathes telling him he had never faced so pitiful an opponent. Arimathes, infuriated by Hercules' remarks rose to his feet \"Now you shall learn why I am Emperor!\" he yelled as he stuck Hercules with a blow \"that would rend a mountain asunder!\"</p><p>Hercules stood unfazed and the two stood toe to toe trading punches. Arimathes continued to brag just as Hercules continued to goad his young son. After calling his mother a \"lying wench\" Arimathes unleashed a punch so forceful that it literally broke the sound barrier!</p><p>Stunned as never before, Hercules was lifted in the air by Arimathes, and then brutally slammed to the ground. Apparently defeated, Hercules lie on the ground and Arimathes, still bragging, raised another boulder above his head with which to finish off his father. Before Arimathes could deliver his possible killing blow, Hercules rose and landed a viscious haymaker directly to Arimathes head. Launched in the air by the blow, it took \"a full six seconds for Arimathes unconscious form to impact abruptly to earth!\" Hercules had defeated his son blindfolded!</p><h2>Reconcilliation</h2><p>Hercules, fearing the worst, sought out his sons body. When he came to Arimathes who was just awakening from unconsciousness he explained to his son how his arrogance and \"wagging tongue\" had been his downfall. He told him \"If you were not so headstrong and egotistical--thou would have defeated me with ease!\" Arimathes realized that if his father had risked his life simply to teach him humility that perhaps all the deragatory things his mother had told him were not true. Arimathes in a show of his learned humbleness and his newfound trust in his father asked Hercules \"Can you teach me what I am lacking father?\"</p><p>Hercules and his son forgave one another and , under the tutelage of his father, Arimathes eventually became a worthy and honorable Emperor.</p><h2>Physical Characteristics</h2><p>Height: 6'6\"</p><p>Weight: 320</p><p>Eyes: Blue</p><p>Hair: Red</p><h2>Strength</h2><p>Born the son of the strongest Olympian God, Arimathes possesses vast superhuman strength. The exact limit to his strength is unknown, but it rivals that of his father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\" href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\">Hercules</a>, and is thus far above the Class 100 level.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Besides his strength, Arimathes has superhuman speed, agility and endurance. He is extremely dense and virtually invulnerable to any and all physical harm. He has proven capable of standing toe to toe with Hercules in combat and holding his own without receiving any serious or permanent injuries.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Arimathes is a natural leader and a brilliant tactician. He has been extensively trained in all the combat techniques of the 24th century. His divine heritage combined with his advanced knowledge and combat techniques makes him an extremely formidable hand to hand combatant.</p>",

There, his cellmate is a Navajo medicine man.  Near death, the old shaman gives Raven a winged harness, hidden under the mattress. The harness was \"treated with a special Indian herb\" that allowed the air to pass through the feathers, and on the downstroke, close together, allowing the wearer to beat the air. When the Indian dies, Raven simply flies from his cell as a guard opens the door. <br/>  <br/>Going on a criminal rampage, Raven meets his match when the Rawhide Kid heads for the Navajo tribe, getting wings of his own, and has a mid-air showdown with the felon.</p>",

When Sora was 4, Ventus' own heart came and merged with Sora's which was the cause of <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/roxas/4005-45589/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45589\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roxas</a> looking like Ventus.</p><p>Sora was a fourteen year old who lived in Destiny Islands. He spent almost all his childhood with his competitive friend <a href=\"/riku/4005-45370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45370\">Riku</a>. Other notable residents from Destiny Islands include Selphie from Final Fantasy VIII and Tidus and Wakka from Final Fantasy X. Sora usually played and fought with Riku and Tidus. One night, a girl named <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kairi/4005-45968/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45968\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kairi</a> arrived and Sora felt something for her. Sora, Kairi, and Riku lived happy in the island, but Sora soon realizes his feelings for Kairi are coming deeper and stronger, as does Riku. Sora and Riku became a little competitive for Kairi´s attention. One day Riku threw Sora a paopu fruit and told him that if two people share it, their destinies will cross and will be together forever. Sora and Riku even had a race to determine who would share the paopu with Kairi.</p><p>Sora, Kairi, and Riku planed to leave the Islands to find and explore new worlds. They built a raft gathered supplies for their journey. One day Selphie spoke to Sora about the paopu fruit, he later spoke to Tidus who told him that Riku whipped them yesterday in the fights and that Kairi would surely stay with him. Sora became jealous and walked towards the secret cave under the waterfall.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618291-erty.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-618291\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.640625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618291-erty.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-618291\"><img alt=\"Sora´s drawing only it didn´t have Kairi´s arm\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618291-erty.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618291-erty.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Sora´s drawing only it didn´t have Kairi´s arm</figcaption></figure><p>Inside the cave, he observed and reminisced on the drawings they all made when they were little, but two were special. The drawings he and Kairi made years ago, Sora drew Kairi and Kairi drew Sora. Sora sat down and started adding something extra to the drawings, a hand extended to Kairi with a paopu fruit, demonstrating for the first time his very strong feelings for Kairi. A man and Sora thought it was a friend and he was ashamed they saw their prove about what he felt for Kairi. The man talked to him about the other worlds and Sora looked kind of worried, but the man vanished. Sora didn´t knew what happened, but he forgot about that day. One night a storm came to Destiny Island where the \"Door\" to the other worlds was opened by beings known as Heartless. The Heartless arrived and began their assault on Destiny Island. Sora saw the storm out of his bedroom window and ran out worried about the raft. When he gets there he notices Riku and Kairi's boats are already tied up there, so he begins to search for his friends. He finds Riku and discovers that Riku has accepted the door as a gateway to more worlds and disappears. By the Door he finds Kairi but something appears to be wrong. That when the Door is blasted open by a blast of wind sending Kairi her falling towards him. He opens his arms to catch her but she vanishes on contact, and he is here told outside. It was then that Sora mysteriously gained the powerful <a href=\"/keyblade/4055-46214/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46214\">Keyblade</a> which he uses to fight his way through the Heartless. Coming upon a giant one, he runs only that world is disappearing, so he turns and fights. Unfortunately, Destiny Island gets destroyed and Sora became lost in an inter-dimensional gateway and eventually lands on a new World.</p><p>The three of them also learn that the villain Maleficent (From Sleeping Beauty) is planning to kidnap the seven Princesses of Heart that will open the door to Kingdom Hearts, the heart of all worlds. They also reunite with Riku for a sort time who then disappears. Riku is tricked into joining Maleficent, who promised to help him find Kairi. Maleficent also convinces Riku that Sora had abandoned him and Kairi for his new friends. When Riku finds Kairi, he cannot locate her heart, and jumps to the conclusion that the heartless have taken it and searches for a way to get it back.</p><p><b><i>Wonderland</i></b></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/600317-162.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-600317\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.83375\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/600317-162.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-600317\"><img alt=\"Wonderland\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27174/600317-162.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/600317-162.jpg 800w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27174/600317-162.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Wonderland</figcaption></figure><p>Wonderland from Alice in Wonderland is the first destination that Sora, Donald, and Goofy land on.

Riku was able to take Sora’s Keyblade away from him, telling Sora that he was just a “delivery boy” and that Riku is the true wielder. Despite Sora choosing light and Riku choosing dark, Riku had a stronger heart then Sora which made him the better wielder. With the Keyblade being in the hands of Riku, Donald and Goofy are forced to abandon Sora and join the new Keyblade wielder. However, Riku then chooses darkness on his own free will, and with Sora choosing light on his on free will, the Keyblade returns to its rightful wielder. With the Keyblade returned to Sora, he battles Riku and would defeat him. This happens when Riku attack Sora to get ride of him. Goofy jumps in front of Riku's dark bast using his shield to save Sora. Riku thinks that Goofy is willing to betray his King in order to save Sora, but Goofy says that he would never betray the King but he wouldn't betray his friends either. As Donald goes over to Sora too Sora tells Riku that its not the size of the heart that matters, but the friends that gives his heart its strength. Thats when the Keyblade abruptly leaves Riku and goes back to Sora.

The door is then revealed to be the gateway between light and dark, and with King Mickey and Riku on the other side. The plan was to close and seal the door from both sides, with Sora being on the light side and King Mickey and Riku sealing it on the Dark side. Sora sees the many Heartless approaching the door on the other side and Riku agrees to close it as he said \"C´mon together\" Sora and Riku close the door, only that if he closes the door</p><p>he would be losing Riku possibly forever.

With their memories restored (Except for the events that happened at Castle Oblivion), they go back to Twilight Town to regroup and find out were they are. The three of them decide to continue their mission to find King Mickey and Riku. In town they meet and learn from Hayner, Pence, and Olette that a person resembling King Mickey is at the train station. There they encounter the Nobodies for the first time (that they know of). They are rescued but the King who tells them to get on the train that it knows were to take them, and leaves before they can say or do anything. As Sora says goodbye to Hayner, Pence, and Olette he sheds a tear but does not know why, probably from the Roxas that is now in him. The three of them on the train head to the tower in Twilight Town where it is the home of Yen Sid, a powerful sorcerer. There they run into Mickey oldest nemesis Pete. Pete is trying to make an army form Maleficent not knowing that she is gone. Sora seeked advice from Yen Sid and would also gain new clothing from the faries named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Sora gains new powers from his new clothing, the magical power is explained to him to be gained from the heart of his and all his friends, giving him the power to change form each having different abilities. The Forms are Valor, Wisdom, Master, Final, and Shadow Form. Each needing Donald, Goofy, and sometimes his friends to help him. The Shadow Form is not chosen but comes up randomly when he choses to change Forms. The three of them set of on their mission to find Riku and King Mickey, and hopefully then to Kairi.</p><p>Learning from Yen Sid that the worlds have still not returned to peace and that there is a new threat in the Organization XIII they set out on another journey to save the worlds from heartless and Nobodies alike. Also, Maleficent is resurrected and is looking for a new Castle to rule from do to the one in Hollow Bastion being destroying and the people taking the world back. She wants revenge on Sora but learns from Pete that there is another group called Organization XIII that has come to power since she has been gone. Now that the doors to the other worlds are doors closed she tries to find other ways of travel.</p><p>First arriving back in Hollow Bastion the group fined it being rebuilt. Leon and the others have started a committee called the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee, that is in charge of the towns protection and rebuilding. They make and give Sora, Donald, and Goofy honorary membership cards as gifts. At the bailey on the edge of town Leon shows them there problem. In the distance is the heartless temporary castle and in between an ocean of heartless soldiers. Along with the new enemy the Nobodies scattered all about away from the heartless. Just at that they hear a voice and the whole group of Organization XIII out of dark portals to stand above and in front of Sora and the others there presence is profoundly ominous. Making their presence known and warning them not to interfere they leave, except one who came done to confront Sora. Sora orders him to move aside, but he only laughs at him. Saying this isn't the kiddy league anymore and he should just run on home. Sora just stands ready to fight glaring at him. The Organization member just laughs again saying yeah he gave me that look to and disappears. The card Yuffie gave him begins to glow and Sora uses the Keyblade on it to open a portal to other new worlds. Hollow Bastion becomes the center of many problems that unfold you are first summoned back by Merlin who has rediscovered Winnie The Pooh’s story book and knowing how close Sora was with him decides to tell you first. Merlin goes out to tell the others but Sora can’t wait and goes into the book to see Pooh Bear at first everything seems to be fine, but Sora gets yanked out of the book when heartless attack. They tear several pages from the book and scattered them across the worlds, Sora quickly goes back to see if Pooh is alright but Pooh has forgotten about everyone. Sora has to return many times to completely restore Pooh’s book. Another group of group of good new is discovered. First Sora, Donald, and Goofy meet up with Cloud again, who is still looking to defeat Sephiroth which he believes once he defeats will get rid of all the darkness in him. The best news is that Leon has found the hidden lab and computer used by Ansem the Wise in his research of the heartless, and that the king is there waiting for them. Sora is so eager to find Riku and learn more about Nobodies. Stitch falls from the ceiling onto the keyboard; Donald jumps up to chase him off. The computer has alarms go off, and the computer says “any further misuse of this terminal will cause the use of forced”. Then Donald takes another causes step setting the alarms off again and the MCP hits them with a beam that digitizes them and sends them into the computer to Tron’s world. They meet Tron in the pit cell. Tron is a defense program used by Ansem called DTD. The MCP is taking control off the whole system. Sora gets back out and finds the password to restore the DTD to its full potential. DTD turns out to stand for DOOR TO DARKNESS. That’s when the king shows up and fills them in on things that have been happening. And that the door to the darkness can only be opened by the princess of heart which makes their names the password. King Mickey orders him to go and give Tron that password, Sora and the others don’t want to leave him because they still have so many questions, but the King promises he won’t be going anywhere he needs to protect the computer. After Tron puts the password in the MCP tries to take over the whole system, but Tron changes the password to stop it. Using the information the MCP was able to gather to crank out heartless into the world. It also wreaks havoc with the defense program. Cid starts to write a program to (De-rezz) delete the MCP for good. Sora and the others get Tron to the IO tower to receive the download. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Tron race to delete the MCP. First they stop the MCP’s second in charge Stark. After Stark is down they go after the MCP. Once the MCP is gone Tron says good-bye to his friends and jumps into the pit that the MCP used to be in. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy get out of the computer I seams Tron has taken the place of the MCP. He gives them a treat for their help. He makes the town look the why it use to be. Aerith tells them that the Town wasn’t always called Hollow Bastian it us to be called Radiant Gardens. With that they leave the town safe from the Heartless and Nobodies.</p><p>In the next word you reunite with Mushu how is helping (Mulan) Ping get into the royal army. Sora, Donald, and Goofy see him making a shadow of himself against a flat stone pillar, and think he’s a heartless. When they jump out to get him he hides behind (Mulan) Ping. Discovering its Sora and the others he introduces Ping saying that he is trying to get HIM into the army. Goofy is the only one to see through the disguise that (Ping) Mulan is a girl. Mulan likes that it fooled them, But Mushu says he’s not sure that Sora and Donald would fall for just about anything. Mushu asks if they can help Mulan and they decide since her help them why not return the favor. At camp they get in a fight with the other three main army characters in the food line which the Captain brakes up. The Admiral is not impressed with Ping but Sora talks him in to giving them three chances to prove them selves all adequate, even though it was only “Ping” he had a problem with. Mushu see the Hun Leader (Shan- Yu) go into a cave when you get up in the mountains and instead of tell the Captain, they go to fight him themselves only to get caught in a trap. When they get free the town and the soldiers outside have been attacked. To redeem themselves for there mistake they go to fight him alone. After fighting of a small army of heartless Mulan uses a cannon to cause an avalanche, to berry the Hun leader. When Mushu gets out of the snow he blows of his mouth in front of the Captain giving away Mulan’s secret. Mulan is then dismissed and told to be never seen again. On the way down the Mountain She sees the Hun leader pop out of the snow and go down to the Imperial City. Sora and the others with Mulan run to the city to warn the Captain. They get there just in time to guard the front door. After the leader is defeated, they are all honored and Mulan is give the sword of Shan-Yu. This is the next portal for Sora to open. When saying good-byes the Captain is embraced by the Emperor for being so blunt in saying that if he wishes to win the heart of Fa Mulan he will have to work very hard. Sora and the group come back later to stop the Organization from doing damage. Sora first encounters the disguised Riku as he leads them up to the mountain top to show them that the Organization have sent a dragon to attack the city. Riku continues to go and warn the Emperor of the danger, but says that three wise guys had shown up and they would take care of it. Before reaching the Emperor the four meet the Organization Member Xigbar, who instead of fighting them directly summands heartless to fight them and he makes a hasty escape. After Sora and the others beet the dragon they are give the chance for anything to be their’s, but all Sora wants to know is what the man in the black hood said to him. After the Emperor tells them Sora is sure it was Riku but doesn’t know why he would be in the Organization. Mulan asks for the Captain to be given a vacation so that they can spend some time together since the have become in love. The Emperor he can not let the Captain go in the time of need but she can work beside him. The two embrace making Sora go into a daze wondering about Kairi, which Donald and Goofy tease him about.</p><p><b><i>Beast's Castle</i></b></p><p>Sora’s first time to Beast’s Castle is like most worlds abruptly shaken by the appearance of the heartless. Sora, Donald, and Goofy fight them off in Beast’s sitting room where his magic rose is resting on a table. The heartless keep on coming and Sora is starting to get tired. Luckily for them that is when Beast makes his entrance, sweeping the heartless away with mighty blows. Sora thanks Beast for the save, but Beast just whaps him aside, with out even a falter in his step. He picks up his rose cradling it in his arms and leaves. Worried something must be wrong with him Sora, Donald, and Goofy follow him out into the entrance hall were Goofy thinks he sees a girl go off down the east wing. They follow the hall to a room where Belle is. She is very grateful for them being there that she picks up Donald and smothers him in a hug while he struggles in discomfort. Belle thinks that they are there because of Beasts odd change. She tells them that Beast would be in the west wing, but they must set his servants free from the dungeons were Beast has locked them. After fighting a defeating a guardian heartless placed in the dungeons door they free Coggsworth, Mrs. Pots, and Lumbeair they make they way to Beast’s room. It seems that one of the Organization has tricked beast into not trusting anyone, and Sora has to beet some sense back into him. Beast immediately goes to punish him, but they all get side tracked by Belle’s calls for help in the ballroom. The Organization member Xaldin has set a large chained heartless on Bell, and Sora and the gang all work together to defeat it. This unlocks a secret magic in Beast’s rose causing it to glow allowing Sora to open the next pathway. Sora and the gang leave thinking that things are alright, but return to see that Xalden is not quite done with his tricks. Interrupting Bell’s and Beast’s dance to tell Beast that he will take something dear to him. Beast immediately protects Belle but saving her from the Nobodies realizes that that is not what Xaldin meant. He rushes to his room to see that his rose has been taken. Believing that all hope of him returning to normal has gone he orders Belle and Sora to leave. Belle leaves the room disheartened, and Sora and his group leave, confused to why he would do such a thing, to stop in front of Coggsworth, Mrs. Pots, and Lumbeair explain the secret of the rose. Sora goes back in to Beast to give him a pep talk, reminding him what the castle was like before Belle came and that the rest of his servants were depending on him as well. Beast, faith restored, goes to confront Xalden. Belle watching from her balcony as they enter the castle courtyard sees the rose next to her. Picking it up she shouts to Beast that she’s found it; while Xalden grabs her from behind. He leaps across the courtyard to the bridge, with Beast and Sora right behind. Xalden feeling as though he has won says to the Beast that he will be leaving lightly so what should he leave behind. Beast started panicking, and yelled out for Belle. Belle thinking fast elbowed Xalden hard in the gut grabbed the rose and ran back to the castle. Beast and Sora weren’t done yet, and took up a hard fight against Xalden who controlled 8 wind lances that he could make into a large dragon. Sora was able to finish him off, and then Beast plucked up the courage to ask Belle if she would stay with him. Sora ends his journey with them as Beast and Belle got to share their awaited dance, and as Sora watched on it stood to remind him of how Kairi and him danced once when they were younger.</p><p><b><i>Olympus Coliseum</i></b></p><p>On their return to the Olympic Collusion Donald doesn’t land were he intends to. They end up landing in the entrance to the underworld. Just as they are about to go see Hercules, Megera comes running out from the underworld being chased be attack dog Heartless. Sora, Donald, and Goofy hurry to save her. Sora gives her a hand up and Meg introduces herself in her normal flirtatious sarcastic way. She thanks Sora for the help and he says it was nothing, but Donald says just doing what heroes do; and Goofy has to continually correct Donald by saying don’t you mean junior heroes. She tells them that Herc has been set up with battle after battle complements of Lord Hades himself. The never ending battles are warring Herc out and even heroes have their limits. Meg was going to try to talk Hades into giving Herc a brake. Sora said that he could go to Hades for her. Meg was very thankful for their help, but made them promise not to tell anyone else about her going down there. Unknown to Sora and the others Pete had come to see Hades as well and was already talking to him. At the last stretch before entering Hades's tower and Organization member ran past Sora, Donald, and Goofy not bothering to fight just yelling \"run away\" before disappearing into a portal to the darkness leaving them completely perplexed. In Hades's tower Pete said with all the monsters Herc was sending to the underworld it would be better if he just sent someone who was already dead. Hades thought that that was actually a good idea, and brought out Auron from (Final Fantasy X) the deepest prison in the under world. Hades made him a deal saying that he would have his slate wiped clean if he did one favor for him. Auron’s response was to say “I’m sorry but you’re not part of my story”. Sora, Donald, and Goofy came in just as Hades was swinging at Auron for saying this. Sora and his group try to fight Hades and help Auron but in to underworld there is a curse that saps all the strength from heroes, making them what Hades calls them Zeros. Auron and Sora must fight Cerberus and defeat him to get out of the underworld. Sora uses his keyblade to unlock a door to get free, set there by Hades to stop them. Pete explains to Hades that that key can open ANY lock which gives Hades an idea. Meanwhile Sora reunites with Hercules who is glad to see them. After telling Herc they had a problem they had to work around in the underworld and asks Hercules about a way to counter the curse of the underworld. Herc says they is a stone called the Olympus Stone the Gods use when they have to go down there but is was just stolen buy some guy in a black cloak. Herc says if they can get it back they can use it for a while. Sora, Donald, and Goofy end up cornering the Organization member who is Demnyx in the underworld and battle him to get the Stone back. Winning back the stone it becomes the next link to the next pathway. Sora, Donald, and Goofy are able to go on but they bring the stone back to Herc where it seems that Meg has been captured by Hades to set a trap for Sora. Herc can’t help because Hades has him set up against the Hydra next and if he leaves people could get hurt so it is up to Sora and the others to save Meg. They get to the other end of the underworld and unlock a magically sealed area that has Meg stuck on the other side. They have to Battle Pete and an army of heartless to save her, Herc joined them half way through and in the end the cavern that they were in caves in. Returning back to the Coliseum Herc finds that the Hydra was not defeated, and he had left the people at its mercy. This made him drop into such a deep depression that made him lose his power for a some time, believing he was not worthy to be a hero. Unknown to Sora the Lock he had just unlocked was put there by Zeus to seal up the Underworlds under Drome which was a place that was to dangerous for anyone. Know that it is open Hades has planed to start his own Coliseum games, which is like the original Coliseum games only harder, more dangerous, and more challenging than the first Kingdom Hearts was. These games push Sora and his group to the edge of there power along with Hercules. Their final battle was to be with Auron, but something was wrong with him. Sora followed him to find out that Hades had taken control over him by taking control of his sole. Sora told Hercules of the issue and told him to stand against him till Sora, Donald, and Goofy could get the figure of Auron Hades had, and could return it to him. Hoping this would free Auron from Hades power. Sora is able to return Auron's sole, and they all fought Hades until he fell into the river stix. Hercules returned to his full glory. At the end Sora, Donald, and Goofy are awarded true heroes by the Gods, by having the pictures painted in the stars.</p><p><b><i>Disney Castle</i></b></p><p>The gummi ship is pulled to Disney Castle, being summoned by Queen Minnie. The castles barrier has been breeched by the heartless. The room holding the castles magical protection, a large sphere called the Cornerstone of Light, has been shrouded with creeping black vines. Sora accompanies the Queen to the Cornerstone of Light Room guarding her from the heartless, ass Donald and Goofy go of to make sure the rest of the castles occupants are safe. When they join back together in the Cornerstone of Light Room a projection of Maleficent comes to gloat that the Queens castle will soon bee her new domain since Sora and group destroyed her last castle. After this gloomy display they quickly conclude that Merlin is the only person with enough magical knowledge to help. Sora and group rush back to Hollow Bastion to get Merlin’s aid. Merlin is quickly told that the Queen is in danger, and Donald launches into a long hardly discernible explanation. While Donald starts yapping on Merlin unnoticeable magically brings them to the Cornerstone Room at the Disney Castle. Donald is stunned into silence by Merlin’s display, and Merlin starts off studying the room. He concludes that all of the problems occurring at the castle haze to do with tampering with the worlds past. He summons a door that will bring them back in time to the point in which things were changed, but he stops them before they go trough. He warns them that by going through he does not know what type of effects it will have on them, and they must avoid from doing anything that might change there past, because they in effect stop themselves from existing. This terrifies Donald so much that he does not want to go. Sora and Goofy have to carry Donald to the door and Heave Ho toss him through the door and then walk though after him. They all come flying out of the other side to the time or world Timeless River, which is based on the first Mickey Mouse cartoon Steam Boat Mickey. Sora stands up and realizes that everything is in black and white, and everything is lacking detail, but that isn’t what’s bothering Donald and Goofy. They are both overcome with an overpower feeling of De-ja-vu. But their uncomfortable feelings are quickly put aside as they see an oddly dressed Pete run by. Pete being Pete they assume it must be him, and chase after him. After a short battle with Pete they start to think that this might not the same Pete that they know. Pete goes on to tell them he was running because someone had stolen his steamboat. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy get back up to the top of Cornerstone hill they see heartless jump into four separate window shaped portals, and a curtained video screen appears. Donald pulls the string to open the curtain and they watch. It shows (from the bad Pete’s point of view) being scolded by Maleficent for being completely useless. Pete then wonders to himself if he really chose the right path in life, and if he could go back he would change. While he is doing so a similar door appears to him as if it heard his calls. As Sora and the others watch, they end up flying through the door again as if it were for the first time. They continue through the portals after the heartless meeting the King in each of the areas. Only it was Mickey before he was King, and with each place saved they watched a new clue into Pete’s door to the past. It comes to show that Pete shows the door to Maleficent and she sent him to see what is on the other side. After he returns she comes up with a plan to steal the Cornerstone of Light leaving the castle defenseless. The group returns to the hill to find the Cornerstone gone. They run off to the port to find the good Pete and the bad Pete face to face. Sore and good Pete fought bad Pete, but he is still able to get away. Sora and the others run after him to find that bad Pete had stolen the steamboat and is trying to toe the Cornerstone away. Pete does all that he can to stop Sora and get away, but as usual fails. Bad Pete goes through his door back to their time and Sora locks it behind him, and as a reword the good Pete allows you to steer his steamboat to take the Cornerstone back. As they prepare to go back home Donald is temped to do something that would do exactly what Merlin warned them about. Luckily Goofy and Sora were able to grab and stop him before he could do what he was going to do, and they had to Heave Ho Donald back through again. Arriving back in the castle, door vanishing behind them, they where able to see the vines disintegrate. After that was finished the Cornerstone began to glow opening a new path for the trio to travel down and also allowing the group to continue on with the castle now protected again.</p><p><b><i>Atlantica</i></b></p><p>Atlantica is the most unique of all the world in that everything done here is done in song and dance. At Sora, Donald, and Goofy’s return Sebastian offers to give the group a refresher coarse in swimming. The story starts back of at the beginning with Ariel lost in thoughts of the life up on land, mainly of Prince Eric having just presently rescued him from his ship which was sunk during a storm. King Trident is not pleased that Ariel is unhappy but more so that she is thinking about “Land” and “Humans”. Sebastian is put in charge of Atlantica’s yearly consort and taking Ariel’s mind off of things above. Sora is eager to help cheer Ariel up so he offers to help in the production. Only after Sebastian puts them all through some dance lessons are they allowed to join, their timing had to be perfect in order for Sebastian to be satisfied. The first song the sing is a newly written song called “Swim this Way” all about under water living. This is all to change Ariel’s attentions, which needless to say does not work. They go on to sing songs such as “Part of Your World” and “Under the Sea” following the roles in the Movie. The major battle against Ursula is played out in the song “Ursula’s Revenge” in which Sora knocks the Trident out of Ursula’s hand where in Prince Eric proceeds to throw it streaking through the air to run through Ursula ending her for good. As the battle finishes the Trident which has now landed at the bottom of the ocean reveals the passage that leads them on and now prevents the Heartless and the Organization from meddling in their affairs. This world s journey ends with the song “A New Day is Dawning” in which Ariel’s love for Prince Eric has won through braking down the barriers that were between them. Ariel is now sad that Sora and the others have to leave, and is promised in an off tune song that they will never be apart for good.</p><p><i><b>Halloween Town</b></i></p><p>Sora, Donald and Goofy arrive once again to Halloween Town. As they do, they´re costumes changes. Sora becomes a vampire, Donald a mummy and Goffy looks like a mad person. They need to change their appearance so the people of the town, recieves the good. Sora, Donald and Goofy sees Zero and Sora says \"Hello boy\" as Jack Skellington arrives in an odd way. Jack is at the night sky, with a Christmas trinie. He gets off the trinie and speaks \"Sora, Donald and Goofy, it is so nice to see you and... Merry Christmas!\" The look surprised due to this place was really only for Halloween. Sora says \"Merry Christmas? Don´t you mean, Happy Halloween?\" Jack starts talking about Christmas and mentions \"Sandy Claws\" and Sora, confused again says \"Sandy Claws?\" and Goofy says \"I think he means Santa Claws\". Jack tells them about this place as he asks if Jack has seen Riku or the King and Jacks denies. Jack is convinced to take them to Christmas Town. Jack leads them as they enter the wood-christmas tree- door. They pass and arrive at Christmas Town. They see that heartless are also there. They defeat them and go to Santa´s factory. They enter as they see Santa Claus. Daonlad asks Santa if he was is his list and Santa says that of course he was. Goofy also asks him the same question and Santa says yes. Sora approaches happy and asks Santa if he was in his list. Santa looks at his list and says indeed, but says \"Sora! , you were told by another boy (Riku) that Santa Claus didn´t exist and later you told a little friend (Kairi) that you didn´t belive in Santa.\" Sora looks disappointed and steps back. Jack, confident saks him again and Santa exclaims</p><p>\"You´re Jack Skellington-!\" as they see that Locke, Shack and Barrel were entering the factory. Later it is seen that Malificient was telling Locke, Shack and Barrel that she would bring back Oogie Boogie. She brings him back and tells him to defeat Sora and the other \"imbeciles\". Sally had heard al. sally goes to tell Jack, but Jack ignores her warning, not listening at her. Santa goes to see Jack, Sora, Donald and Goofy. but he gets caught by Oogie along wih Sally. Again, Sora, Donald and Goofy comes to the rescue. Sora destroys Oogie Boogie as Santa is finally released. Sora, Donald and Goofy goes to another wolrd, knowing they will come back.</p><p>At the second visit, they are informed that Dr. Finklestein´s experiment was missing. Sora and the other gang began their search. Shack, Locke and Barrel appear again, as they broke in Santa´s Factory. Again they are defeated and they are officialy gone. Santa worried tells them that lately there has been a kidnapper of presents. Sora, Donald and Goofy began to make thepresents. they are finally done as Jack says he will take care of the rest. Finally, they go to Santa to tell them the presents are now done. Their plan was to set up a trap for the kidnapper. Santa gives them a place where they could set the trap and catch the theif. they go to the Plaza as Santa asks Jack his plan. Jack does not tell, only sayin it is a good plan.</p><p>\"But I also have a wonderful idea. If we catch the theif for you.. I would be honored to deliver the-\"</p><p>\"And on that note, we´ll be going! \" in that moment, Sora covered Jack´s mouth and take him away, not wanting to cause more trouble. the dinamic quartet had the plan to spill presents and they would be on a gigantic one. in that way, they would lure the thief and catch him. Although Donald was sure someone was kicking him... .Finally, they catched the thief, it was the missing experiment. They fought it, as they finally eliminated it. It was over. Santa Claus arrived in his triney and gave them thanks to hem. And Jack´s wish became true. Santa let him drive the triney. Jack delivered the presents. When Jack rode it, Santa Claus said strange words</p><p>\"Yes, all that poor puppet wanted was a heart\"</p><p>They arrived to tell the Dr that his experiment was the guilty. He called his experiment \"successful\". Sora tries to tell him about the heart theory, of why he stole presents. The Dr finally tells says it is possible, that unlike Sally, the experiment did not have a heart.</p><p>\"But if it wanted a heart, why was it going around stealing all those Christmas Presents?\" Sora could not understand</p><p>\"Maybe because...presents are a way to give your heart to someone special\" Sally came</p><p>\"Hmm... when you put it that way, I feel sort of bad for him\" Sora made a second thought. Jack suddenly came flying of the sky. Santa wished everyone happy Halloween.</p><p>\"What a nice present\" Sally said as it snowed</p><p>\"I dont understand. there is no box, No ribbon tied in a bow!\" Jack yellped</p><p>\"Jack, Its not about the box or the ribbons. Its about whats inside the box!\" Sora replied</p><p>\"No Sora\" Sally corrected \"What really counts-- whats really special--is the act of giving a gift. To wish deep in your heart to make someone else happy.\"</p><p>\"Right, of course! Thank you Sally, you are absolutely right\" exclaimed Jack. Suddenly he stroke his chest</p><p>\"Wait! whats this? I feel so strange, so very happy!\"</p><p>\"Jack! that must be Sally´s present\" Goofy said</p><p>\"Really? This wonderful feeling?Oh Sally, You´ve given me the nicest present in the world!\" said Jack holding her hand \"And I´ve nothing to give you in return. What would you like? Just name it. Absolutely anything\"</p><p>\"The nicest present I could ever ask for Jack, Is just to be with you\" Donald and Goofy covered their eyes, as Sora just blushed</p><p>\"You don´t even have to ask for that!\" in that moment Jack carried Sally away.</p><p>Sally and Jack began to dance in the night. Sora, Donald and Goofy just stared</p><p>\"Maybe, I never gave her a real present after all\" said Sora deeply</p><p>\"Who?\" asked Donald. Goofy tapped Sora´s shoulders</p><p>\"Aw, i bet Kairi would like most anything you gave her\" said Goofy comforting Sora</p><p>\"I know. Thats what made it so hard to decide\" Sora replied</p><p>\"Its not the gift, its what´s in your heart!\" Donald said</p><p>\"My heart\" Sora repeated</p><p>\"You bet, Kairi is like Sally!\" said Donald</p><p>\"How?\" asked Sora</p><p>\"Well, as long she can be with you, what else does she need?\" responded Goofy. Sora understood, and gazed up at Sally and Jack dancing.</p><p>...And then it started.</p><p>Slowly, Jack and Sally turned into a different person. Sora and Kairi. Sora replaced Jack and Kairi Sally. Sora smiled as he held the 14´s year old Kairi´s hands. Sora was taller than Kairi and she was younger (he did not know her physical appearance now). They were dancing in circles. Sora and Kairi had smiles on their faces, really big ones. Kairi began to giggle in a very cute way. for a long time. it was beautiful moment. Suddenly, Sora was snaped back into reality. He knew it was a day dream. he began to laugh as Halloween Town was finally over. In this scene it showed although Sora was sometimes childish, he had a greater maturity. He had shown bigger feelings towards Kairi, more than a friendship...</p><p><i><b>Port Royal</b></i></p><p>Port Royal is the newest place they visit. They are overwhelmed by how much more “real looking” this world is compared to the others and that they easily stick out. There is a blast from the town below and sounds of people screaming in fear. Being the heroes they are they run from the Ports Fort to help those in need. At the docks Pete and his heartless are introducing themselves to Captain Barboasa and his men. Pete is warning the group of pirates to steer clear if they see a brat with a key shaped blade and to goofy looking flunkies. Barboasa doesn’t take Pete’s advice sayin that there an’t a thing in this world that could do them harm do to a curse of some Aztek gold, which he then proceeds to show Pete it did to them. Pete is intrigued by Barboasa, but warns him again that they wheeled a type of magic that an’t of their world, but that only makes Barboasa even more interested finding someone that could be even a match for him. Pete decides to join Barboasa and his crew finding it to his benefit. Back in town however Sora, Donald, and Goofy find Will Turner fending off heartless unable to harm them. Sora and gang jump in and take out the heartless as Will can only stand and watch. Will is very impressed with Sora’s swordsmanship; saying that he’s a great swordsman himself put his skills pail in comparison to Sora’s skill and technique. After a quick round introduction Will ask Sora and the others to help him go after the pirates that kidnapped Miss Swan. Sora seeing that there might be more heartless around aggress to go with Will for the time being. When they reach the dock they meet Pete and some pirates left back to guard their getaway. Will demands’ that they let Elizabeth go but Pete says that that can’t be done seeing Captain Barboasa has taken her with them. So he tells Will that he better start swimming. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Will and rush to fight the pirates but after getting existed form swinging at them with now effect the back off to catch their breath. The pirates laugh as the four of them huff from fatigue but at that moment the clouds clear as they are exposed as zombies. Pete with his big mouth yells out telling the pirates the pirates to look out now that they’re exposed and weak to their magic. Sora yells back to Pete thanking him for the advice. After the pirates are vanquished Pete makes a run for it swearing it’s not the last they’ll be seeing of him. Sora meets Captain Jack Sparrow and adventures occur in this world. At last when it is solved, Elizabeth and Will hugges each other and were in love. Goofy sees Sora and he has his face red.</p><p>\"Sora, how come your face is all red?\" said Goofy pointing at him</p><p>\"It is not red!\" shouted Sora lying and covering his face with a hand and the other one stretching it towards Goofy and Donald</p><p>\"I know who you´re thinking of!\" said Donald, referring to Kairi, as Goofy and Doanld laughed, while Sora was dying inside.</p><p><i><b>Pride Lands </b></i>As Sora, Donald and Goofy arrives, Donald changes their appearances. Donald becomes a bird, Goffy becomes a land turtle and Sora becomes a lion cub, thought to be much alike as the lion <u>Kovu.</u> As they approach they find different apeearance of heartless. They approach and they find that the world is dry without life. Sora, Donald and Goofy are walking through the dead valley, and hienas are willing to attack them, but Nala appraoches to them. She explains about what has been happening since Mufasa died, that now the king was Scar (Mufasa´s brother). Sora, always with the best intentions says he would gladly help them defeating Scar. Nala takes them were the lions live along with Scar. Sora, Donald and Goofy are walking as Donald says to Sora that even if he defeats Scar, he had to become king. Sora, allucinating says he would like to see how does he feel when he becomes king. Sora says to Nala being a bit selfish, even if he defeats Scar, he would have to resign he throne. As Donald and Goofy are laughing about the idea of Sora being a king, Nala presents the trio to them, to Rafiki. Rafiki closely watches Sora, judging him. As he finishes, he speaks to Nala in the ear and walks away. Nala tells them that Rafiki sad that Sora didn´t have the qualities to become a king. Sora dissapointed asks that who could then. Nala tells them about the lost and dead son of Mufasa, Simba. Sora, Donald and Goofy surprised tells her that Simba is still alive, that a long time ago, they visited him. Nala exited tells them to lead her to him. Sora, Donald and Goofy leads her towards Simba, as he lives along with Timon and Pumbaa, fearing his past and destiny. Once they arrive at first Simba didn´t recognize Sora, willing to attack the little cub. Sora tells Simba if he really didn´t recognize him. Simba does and jump towards Sora cub. A scream interrupts them, the scream came of Timon and Pumbaa. Simba, Sora, Donald and Goofy runs to them as they see Nala was hungry and tried to eat them. Simba jumped to her and they both fighted. Suddenly, they both recognized each other and were happy. Nala tells Simba about the problem on their hometown. Simba refuses to go, thinking about how he dihonored by hiding his fate. Simba \"sees\" his father and Mufasa´s soul convinces him to reclaim the throne. They come back and fight Scar, were Scar tells the truth about who killed Mufasa. Scar is defeated and Simba takes the throne. Simba and Nala thanks Sora, Donald and Goofy and they say goodbye. As they are walking Sora demands that although he is little, he is still powerful, due to Donald and Goofy are still mocking him about being king at \"his size\" .Donald says \"Kairi would think that your cute and she would hug you\" they laugh as Sora is saying why do they always tease him whit that.</p><p>Sora returns to Twilight Town and sees someone shouting</p><p>\"H-Help! The sandlot! Its Seifer!.. Somebody please help us!\"</p><p>\"Sounds like we´ve got trouble!\" said Sora as the three walked towards the sandlot. Sora, Donald and Goofy fights Nobodies as Seifer is lying on the floor</p><p>Sora, Donald and Goofy had vanqiushed he Nobodies as black-hooded man says</p><p>\"Impressive\" he said clapping \"By the way, have you seen a man named Axel? I expect he is here somewhere\"</p><p>\"Like I care\" said Sora not interesed</p><p>\"You see, Axel is no longer acing in our best interest\" said the man</p><p>\"Is he with the Organization, too?\" said Goofy as the man nodded</p><p>\"Are you having a fight ?</p><p>\"Not a very organized Organization\" said Sora mocking them</p><p>\"Dont let your guard down\" said the man pointing them \"Axel will stop at nothing to turn you into a heartless\"</p><p>\"Gee, thanks for looking out for us, mister\" said Sora \"But Im sure we can take care of ourselves just fine\"</p><p>\"Glad to hear it\" said the man \"Axel aside, it would brake our hearts to hear something happened to you\"</p><p>\"Hearts? You dont have any hearts?!\" said Donald</p><p>\"True, we dont have hearts, but we remember how was it like. Thats what makes us special\" as the man revealed his face (Xemnas)</p><p>\"Whaddaya mean?\" asked Goofy as a black portal appeared in the back of the man</p><p>\"We know very well how to injure a heart.. Sora, you just keep on fighting hose heartless\" said the man</p><p>\"Lets jump after him\" said Sora whispering</p><p>\"How come?\" asked Donald</p><p>\"Im not sure. But maybe he´ll lead us into the Organization´s world\" said Sora</p><p>\"Dont be reckless. Do you want to end up like Riku?\" said the man</p><p>\"What?\" said Sora givng a little jump. The man walked backwards until he dissapeared in the portal</p><p>\"Hey, wait!\" shouted Sora</p><p>\"What did he mean, end up like Riku?\" Sora asked to Donald and Goofy</p><p>\"Hey, how ´bout you get off my town now? You´ve caused enough trouble.\" said Seifer. Donald looked to Sora, but he was still thinking about what the man said \"Riku...\" Sora said</p><p>\"Have it your way! C´mon guys\" said Donald</p><p>\"Hold it!\" said Seifer</p><p>\"Make up your mind!\" said Donald angry. Seifer pulled out a trophy ( the same he gave to Roxas)</p><p>\"This goes to the strongest guy in Twilight Town\" said Seifer.</p><p>Sora looked shocked and pointed himself \"Thanks, but we dont really need it. Seifer ran towards Goofy and throwed the trophy as Goofy catched it and Seifer walked away.</p><p>Pence appeared and saw Sora, as he runs towards him</p><p>\"Oh! Sora!\" shouted Pence. Sora turned to him</p><p>\"Um...Pence, right?\" said Sora wondering and pointing at him. Pence didn´t mind</p><p>\"Do you know a girl named Kairi? said Pence asking</p><p>Sora, Donald and Goofy jumped of surprised, but not as much as Sora</p><p>\"K-Kairi!!? I sure do!\" shouted Sora with a big smile and happiness</p><p>\"Then you´d better go to the station\" said Pence as he ran away and Sora followed. They arrived outside the station.</p><p>\"He-ey!\" shouted Hayner. Pence stopped and Sora aswell they turned and saw Hayner and Olette running to them as they stopped</p><p>\"Hey, so how do you guys know Kairi?\" said Sora. Hayner and Olette saw each other as a flashback began. It showed Hayner, Pence, Olette and Kairi talking as Sora´s voice was heard</p><p>\"Kairi was really here?!\" the voice sounded</p><p>\"Yeah. And... she said she said she was looking for you\" the voice of Hayner sounded</p><p>\"Tell me where she is!\" shouted Sora as Kairi was showed smiling and laughed</p><p>\"Well...\" Hayner´s voice said as in the flashback Olette turned to Kairi and said</p><p>\"What a romantic story\" said Olette and Kairi smiled at her</p><p>\"If you stick ´round, Sora is bound to show up</p><p>\"Yeah, he said he was coming\" said Hayner</p><p>\"Okey!\" said Kairi happy.</p><p>\"What took you so long, Kairi?\" another voice sounded and the teenagers looked preocuppied, but not as Kairi did</p><p>A portal appeared and Axel came out of it. Hayner and Pence stood up and looked at him</p><p>\"Somehow, I just knew you´d be here\" said Axel \"I tell ya, Kairi, you´ve got a lot of guts, jumping right into the darkness like that\". Hayner got angry and ran towards Axel with a punch in his hand with the intention of hitting him, but when he ran towards him and jumped, he got through Axel like if he was a ghost and fell. Axel walked slowly to Kairi and Pence did the same as Hayner and also got htrough him. We got to near of Kiäiri and grabbed her arm. Kairi made a sound of resisting. Axel turned and was taking Kairi against her will to the portal</p><p>\"Let go of me!\" Kairi tried to resist but she was dragged to the portal \"Let go!\" until she dissappeared. Pluto ran towards the portal to go with Kairi and vanished too. Olette seemd worried as Hayner and Pence stood up looking at the portal that dissappeared. The flashback ended and Sora appeared. He seemed sad and took the oathkeepr Kairi gave him and looked at it</p><p>\"Kairi..\" Sora said</p><p>\"You think it might´a been Axel?\" asked Goofy to Donald as Donald nodded.</p><p>\"Sorry\" said Hayner sadly, as Hayner, Pence and Olette seemed sad</p><p>\"Hey, its not youre fault. C´mon cheer up!\" said Sora wanted to be shown happy. The three looked sad anyway</p><p>Sora faced to the floor and felt real sad</p><p>\"Huh.. Like I can even say that!\" said Sora regreting of what he said. Goofy got close to Sora and Sora jumped</p><p>\"I´ve gotta help Kairi!\" Sora shouted promising himself that. Goofy fell of the jump that Sora did and the trophy fell. The little crystal balls fell and Hayner, Pence and Olette grabbed them \"That was close!\" they said. Sora bent and grabbed the blue one and stood up. he raised his hand with the ball in the hand, stratching it to the sun as the others did the same. Sora viewed it carefully as little by little he transformed into Roxas doing the same thing as he was in a trance</p><p>\"Sora?\" \"Sora are you okay\" Roxas transformed into Sora</p><p>\"Huh? What?\" said Sora as a keyhole opens and Sora closes it</p><p>\"Wha-what just happened?\" asked Pence</p><p>\"A new road is open\" said Sora \"And Kairi and Riku are waiting somewhere along it\" Sora said</p><p>\"You´d better hurry up then\" said Olette</p><p>\"You comin back?\" asked Hayner</p><p>\"Promise!\" said Sora as they leave</p><p>Roxas appears saying he will leave the Organization and Axel says hw will miss him, this revealed to be one of Roxas’ best friends in the Organization. Upon entering the World that Never was, Sora is forced into battle against more Nobodies, eventually defeating them. However it was not over yet, Sora was forced into another battle against Roxas in his Organization XIII attire. After the fight against Roxas, Sora, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy headed for the castle to rescue Riku and Kairi. Sora runs after somebody and suddenly he heard his name being shouted. Sora knew the female voice and turned. Kairi was shouting in a balcony. Sora went happy and shouted her name, but heartless came and pushed him to the ground. Kairi saw Sora was in trouble and said \"Leave Sora alone!\" and jumped and fell to the ground, but heartless came and pushed her to the ground too. Sora closed his eyes and appeared with Donald and Goofy. He ran and defeated several enemies until he saw Kairi with a black-hooded guy with her. Sora and Kairi stood in a bit close to each other. They shouted their names at the same time and Kairi lets a sweet laugh. Sora said she changed and Kairi said he was different too. Kairi told him that it passed a long time. Sora said \"Im sorry it took so long, its just -\" Kairi ran and hugged Sora tightly. A silence origined as Donald and Goofy didn´t tease him this time, but they opened their eyes about why he was thinking about her too much along the journey. Donald and Goofy saw that this was their Sora .</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618324-w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-618324\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6241610738255\" data-width=\"298\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 298px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618324-w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-618324\"><img alt=\"Kairi hugging Sora suddenly\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" data-width=\"298\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618324-w.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618324-w.jpg 298w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kairi hugging Sora suddenly\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618324-w.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/618324-w.jpg 298w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" data-width=\"298\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kairi hugging Sora suddenly</figcaption></figure><p>Sora didn´t react until Kairi said \"This is real...\" and tears were in Kairi´s face.Sora looked at her and hugged her back. The strange black-hooded turned and walked away. Kairi ran and pulled him back and said \"Riku, wait!\" leading Sora to know he was Riku. Sora said \"Riku?\" and ran towards them. Kairi showed Riku´s face which it was Ansem´s. Sora took his hand and started to cry telling him why didn´t he told him he was ok and Riku said he didn´t wanted to know his face. Kairi told Sora to close his eyes. Sora did and Riku appeared as his original and Kairi put their three hands together. Finally, they come face to face with Xemnas leader of Organization XII, who flees to become one with Kingdom Hearts. The Worlds somehow sensing this danger use the energy to summon a door to lead them to Kingdom Hearts. As the three Keyblade wielders stand before the door Riku, Sora, and King Mickey raise their Keyblades. Launched from their tips rise three beams of light, which opens the door. On the other side Xemnas is on top of a giant contraption. The behemoth makes a blast of air blowing Kairi and King Mickey back through the door that then closes, leaving Riku, Sora, Donald, and Goofy to battle Xemnas, but first they must reach him. A wave of buildings rise from the ground toward them as they rush forward. Sora Rush Slices through the buildings opening a path. Using a gravity defying leap Sora and the others reach a grid walkway by to large rockets. The group hits nobodies into the rockets destroying them, and proceed to jump higher to a large piston which they also destroy. They make their final leap to a balcony were Xemnas is seated on a throne. The four of them battle a more powerful Xemnas who controls all of powers of each of the Organization members. With a final lunging blow Xemnas returns to his normal form and falls to one knee. Sora tells Xemnas that there is more to hearts then just anger and hatred, and continues to ask \"Don't you remember\". Xemnas replies \"Unfortunately I don't\" and with that vanishes similar to the others. Riku has a hard time wondering if he should even return, because he gave into the darkness, he wouldn't know how to face anyone. Sora replies (making a funny face) like this, making Riku laugh. But thats when the castle rumbled. Riku tried to open a pathway but King Mickey reminded him that he no longer is a part of the dark realm. As the others squabbled Sora and Kairi sense something and turn to see the shadow of Namine open a portal out. Donald, King Mickey, and Goofy can't see her and wonder how the portal opened but rush in urging the others to follow. Kairi and Sora step in front on Namine and Kairi thanks her. Namine turns to Sora and says \"I promise that we would see each other again\". Sora is very confused. A voice answers \"We promised to meet again but when we did we might not recognize each other\", as a shadow of Roxes steps out of Sora. Namine agrees but says its still strange, but Roxas thinks he understands. That they see themselves as the other remembers them. Namine says that she was afraid that all nobodies were doomed to fade back into nothing, but Roxas says they didn't because they got to meet their original selves. Namine is happy that they'll be back together again. Roxas says as long as Sora and Kairi are together. Kairi says that they'll be together every day, and Sora bashfully agrees. Namine then returns back into Kairi and Roxas to Sora. Sora is still confused and somewhat weired but Riku assures him he is still him. Kairi in the portal calls to all go home, but before Riku and Sora can enter, the portal closes. They are forced into another realm where they battle Xemnas again, who uses the remnants of Kingdom Hearts to power him up. After they defeat them, Sora and Riku are transported to a beach, where they sit and watch the sun set, Riku badly injured from the fight. The two talk about their entire adventure, and eventually decides that they will stay in the darkness since the light realm is now safe. Lying on that beach now facing a sky with no stars the waves wash a bottle up against Rikus' shoe. He picks it up and removes the message thats inside. Taking a glance at it he passes it to Sora telling him that he thinks its for him. It reads...</p><p>Thinkng of you, wherever you are,</p><p>We pray for our sorrows to end,</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604773-t9678z.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604773\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604773-t9678z.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604773\"><img alt=\"Sora reading Kairi´s letter\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604773-t9678z.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604773-t9678z.jpg 150w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sora reading Kairi´s letter\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604773-t9678z.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604773-t9678z.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sora reading Kairi´s letter</figcaption></figure><p>And hope that our hearts will blend.</p><p>Now I will step forward to realize this wish.</p><p>And who knows:</p><p>Starting a journey may not be so hard</p><p>or maybe it has already begun!</p><p>There are many worlds,</p><p>but they all share the same sky-</p><p>one sky, one destiny...</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604774-sora_help_riku_up.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604774\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"720\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604774-sora_help_riku_up.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604774\"><img alt=\"Sora helping Riku\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27174/604774-sora_help_riku_up.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604774-sora_help_riku_up.jpg 720w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27174/604774-sora_help_riku_up.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sora helping Riku\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27174/604774-sora_help_riku_up.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27174/604774-sora_help_riku_up.jpg 720w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27174/604774-sora_help_riku_up.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sora helping Riku</figcaption></figure><p>Upon reading this a door of light opens.

They had a conversation until Kairi runs and hands Sora a bottle with a message and the king´s seal. Sora opens the bottle and reads the letter along with Riku and Kairi. Sora´s face turned surprised. The letter revealed the origins of Terra, Aqua and Ventus for Sora. After he read the letter, he vowed to find Terra, Aqua and Ventus. Sora and Riku were put in a Mark of Mastery exam. They slept and defeated Dream Eaters until Xehanort revealed his purpose: Remake the Keyblade War by finding seven lights and thirteen darknesses to remake the X-Blade. There must be seven guardians of light: Sora, Riku, Kairi, Mickey, Aqua, Terra and Ventus.</p>",

Jenova cells were injected into his embryo, giving him an extraordinary amount of power. Years later, Sephiroth, the top member of Soldier ( Shinra's Army) was sent to Nibelheim with Cloud's best friend Zack, and Cloud himself, to inspect a nearby Mako reactor. On their first trip to the reactor, Sephiroth has a startling realization that he was indeed seeing his mother in the test tube at the back of the reactor. He also realizes that he was an experiment. After Sephiroth had his eppiffany, he stayed isolated in the Shinra mansion for days. Cloud never saw him the same man again.</p><p><b><i><u>The Burning of Nibelheim</u></i></b></p><p>The next week or so, Cloud woke up in the hotel to see that Zack was gone, and that his entire town was aflame. Cloud and Tifa's master, Zangan, help rescue the few survivors left. After this had been done, Cloud decided to chase down Sephiroth and Zack to the only place they would be, the Nibelheim Mako reactor. When <a href=\"/tifa/4005-45198/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45198\"> Tifa</a> got there, she saw that her father was dead. She picked up Sephiroth's left behind <a href=\"/masamune/4055-48075/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-48075\"> Masamune</a> and went to take vengeance. Within seconds of her reaching him, Sephiroth removed the <a href=\"/masamune/4055-48075/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-48075\"> Masamune</a> and swung down, knocking her all the way down the steps.</p><p><b>Bye Bye Nibelheim</b></p><p>Zack saw this extremely unchivalrous act of his former best friend, and tried to stop him, only to fail, with the fight only lasting a matter of seconds.<a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> arrives and sees that Zack and Tifa are down. This, and the fact that Sephiroth had just slashed Tifa, drove <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> over the edge. Zack tells him to take his sword, and so he he did.</p><p><b>Zack vs. Sephiroth</b></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111147274/3701733-2913721694-Final.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3701733\" style=\"width: 704px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"704\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111147274/3701733-2913721694-Final.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3701733\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111147274/3701733-2913721694-Final.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111147274/3701733-2913721694-Final.jpg 704w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111147274/3701733-2913721694-Final.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111147274/3701733-2913721694-Final.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p> </p><p><a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> then, in a flurry of rage, ran behind Sephiroth, who had by now already severed Jenova's head, and stabbed straight into the back, while admitting his dreams and ambitions to Sephiroth.<a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> thought that the fight was over and ran outside to check on Tifa. Sephiroth impales Cloud through the shoulder and lifts him off of the ground. Sephiroth then attempts to throw him over the edge, only to have <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> reverse the leverage and end up tossing Sephiroth off of the catwalk. Sephiroth saw that he needed to escape with Jenova's head or his plan wouldn't work.</p><p>Sephiroth went into hiding for the next few years, and Shinra, ashamed of what he'd done to Nibelheim, erased all files and pretended that he didn't exist. Over the years, Hojo was able to obtain Jenova's body and perform multiple experiments on her, many of them involving the Cetra, aka the Ancients, and trying to unsolve the mystery of what Jenova is. Shortly after <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> and party invaded the Shinra company, they were captured and put in prison until Shinra was ready to question <a href=\"/avalanche/4060-45234/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45234\"> Avalanche</a> and it's affiliates. <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a>woke in a mysterious situation. The door to the prison cell was open and their was a trail of blood that led him and the party straight to Shinra's office, where they saw the obese business man lying on his desk, the Masamune impaling him in the back, pinning him to the desk.</p><p><b><i><u>Cloud's Hunt</u></i></b></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/178641-155494-sephiroth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-178641\" style=\"width: 160px\" data-ratio=\"1.34375\" data-width=\"160\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/178641-155494-sephiroth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-178641\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/178641-155494-sephiroth.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/178641-155494-sephiroth.jpg 160w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/178641-155494-sephiroth.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/178641-155494-sephiroth.jpg 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\"></noscript></a></figure><p> </p><p>There are multiple sightings of Sephiroth as <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> and the party chase him down, but Cloud doesn't get a real lead until he gets on a ship headed for another continent. Every member on board is mysteriously killed, and then <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> finds Sephiroth on board. Sephiroth flies off leaving a battle between <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a>and a strange monster in his wake. After the ship reaches his destination, there are many children on the beach who say they saw a man cloaked in black rise out of the water and head through town. <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a>'s search continues.</p><p><a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a>would next find Sephiroth in the basement of the Shinra mansion in Nibelheim, his home town which he assumed had been burned down. He meets Sephiroth, only for Sephiroth to leave him standing there after flying straight past him, hurling the destruction materia into his stomach, and telling him about the mysterious event, the Reunion.</p><p><a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> then went on to the Nibelheim mountain range, after finding <a href=\"/vincent/4005-45228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45228\"> Vincent</a> in the old Shinra Mansion.<a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> had a hard time fighting through the enemies that Sephiroth had left him, but eventually he got out.</p><p><b><i><u>The Last Ancient, Down and Out</u></i></b></p><p>Unbeknownst to <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a>, Sephiroth and he had not met once during his journey. Sephiroth was still at the Northern crater, waiting for the black materia. He was using Jenova's cells to recreate illusions of himself to fight <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a>. Cloud later teamed up with the pilot, Cid Highwind.</p><p>Sephiroth waited for <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> for a long time until he and his party finally reached the Cetra Ruins. It was there that they acquired the ninja materia hunter Yuffie in their party, and it was there that they found the black materia. Hope didn't seem lost for <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> and his party. Not until Sephiroth, the one person they needed most to not have the black materia, the reason they had tried to take it in the first place, appeared and asked <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> for it. <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> had no control over his body, and soon found himself walking towards Sephiroth and handing it over. <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> had just involuntarily betrayed not only <a href=\"/aerith/4005-45227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45227\"> Aerith</a>, but the rest of his party, and himself.</p><p><b>Aerith's death</b></p><p>\"Thank you, <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a>...\" Sephiroth said as he floated away with an evil grin.</p><p>All hope was lost for <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> and group....unless....unless they were able to reach the home of the Cetra on the North continent. Only if <a href=\"/aerith/4005-45227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45227\"> Aerith</a>'s prayer would reach the white materia and the spirits of their world. If only it would....</p><p><a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> and party went on to face many more foes until they began to reach the North crater, and they got closer and closer to Sephiroth. Sephiroth's goal would finally be complete. One thing that <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> didn't know was that he had not met Sephiroth once since the incident at Nibelheim. He had , in fact, been waiting for <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> and the black materia to reach him so that he could summon Meteor. <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> reached him in due time, and was much stronger, but still definitely not strong enough to fight Sephiroth.</p><p>He finally reached him, after Sephiroth had patiently awaited for all these years. He hoped that <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> had become much more powerful, and would provide a decent fight, if the mind control tricks didn't work on him. After he reached them, he gave <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> a flashback that he would never forget, or remember, either. As part of his plan, he took control of <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> after fooling him into thinking that he had never been through any of the events five years ago at Nibelheim.</p><p>He showed <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> that all of the memories he had were really his best friend Zack's, and that he was nowhere to be found in any of the flashbacks. <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> wandered around in the strange world looking for himself, but he had no memory. He lost himself to the fake memories, and began floating to the top of the Mako rock. He was in no position to keep going. He suddenly disappeared, and the Northern Crater was shielded by Sephiroth's energy. All of the people there at that time were suddenly sent back to a random continent that Sephiroth desired. Even the ancient protectors of the planet formed from Mako, WEAPON, was revived. There were many of them, too. <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> was nowhere to be found when <a href=\"/cid-highwind/4005-45232/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45232\"> Cid Highwind</a> and <a href=\"/tifa/4005-45198/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45198\"> Tifa</a> awoke, and they had to devise an extremely last minute plan, even though all hope seemed lost. Sephiroth's meteor would finally arrive.</p><p>As expected, <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> and party came, lead like moths to a bright light, and so they were travelling through the great Northern Crater and they met up with Rufus Shinra. He assisted the party through the strange mako and materia ridden caves. They never noticed the huge WEAPONs, though they were in the deeper parts of the caverns plain as day. They eventually made it to Sephiroth's chamber and looked up. They had gone through multiple Jenova clones that he had set up for them.</p><p>However, none of <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a>'s friends had enough power to stop him from what he was planning to do. The Ultimate in all of the world weren't enough to stop him. His mother had been taken as an experiment, he had discovered everything about the world as it was, and he didn't like it one bit. And so, he became more powerful with all of his hatred and his resolve, to annihalate those that stood in his way....all to easily. The srength he'd found at the edge of the world...the black materia...stopping holy...Meteor was going to be quite an easy thing to accomplish. That, and turning <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> slightly insane over himself and an identity crisis. He could do that quite easily, as all he had to do was mix up his memories of his past.</p><p><b><i><u>Into the Northern Crater</u></i></b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Not the Hardest thing to do in the world, he thought. He had been poisoned with <a href=\"/mako/4055-45362/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-45362\"> Mako</a> and thus, his memory was not very admirable for a Soldier. He would finally set his plan into motion, and it wouldn't be stopped by the likes of them.</p><p> </p><p>As <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> walked into the area that Sephiroth was sleeping dormant, waiting for the black materia, he was very wary of his surroundings. Sadly, not wary enough. The Jenova that Sephiroth had sent out was going straight for him, and he and party had a hard time fighting it off.</p><p> </p><p>Rufus Shinra ran for cover and so did his other companions, scared of the unknown and what these things were. After <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> finally defeated the weak beast replica, Sephiroth let his plan begin to unfold.</p><p> </p><p>\"Hello, <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> .\" he said, with an evil smirk on his face, laughing on the inside as he forced memories of the fateful day back at Nibelheim. Only, <a href=\"/cloud/4005-43538/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43538\"> Cloud</a> was unaware of his own memories being false. After leading on the FFVII crew and they found out about his plan to become a god and use this planet as a vassel to sail space, they attempted to stop him again. By this time, however, meteor had already been set into action, and he was at the center of the earth, prepared to take in all of the lifestream and fulfill his plans. However, the former Avalanche members came to stop him moments before, and an epic fight ensued.</p><p><b>Sephiroth forced to reveal his final form</b></p><p>Cloud and co were able to defeat him in his bizzaro form, and the Holy Materia then took them to a strange place in which they would continue battling. Sephiroth, his plan almost complete, became somewhat angelic looking in form, and power, with the ability to massacre planets. However, in the end, he was outdone by Cloud's strength, and was forced to reside in his mind. However, he would then challenge Cloud to a fight, one on one, as the crater began to crumble in on itself. He took them to a place where no one could interfere, but Cloud defeated him swiftly with Omnislash...his mind resolved. The One winged Angel fell to the hands of the young man, blood covering his face. His defeat meant nothing though, as they still had to deal with Meteor...and it was all but too late.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b><i><u>Advent Children</u></i></b></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11101/405429-29851-sephiroth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-405429\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.5525\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11101/405429-29851-sephiroth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-405429\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11101/405429-29851-sephiroth.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11101/405429-29851-sephiroth.jpg 400w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11101/405429-29851-sephiroth.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11101/405429-29851-sephiroth.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11101/405429-29851-sephiroth.jpg 400w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11101/405429-29851-sephiroth.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sephiroth has a small role in Advent Children, but is needed to push the story forward.

They engage in a sword battle and Sephiroth, at first, is winning the fight. Sephiroth asks Cloud why he has become so weak. Cloud then separates his swords into the individual swords that composes of his sword. They all go in the air and Cloud jumps to the skies where Sephiroth with a gold aura. Sephiroth is surprised to see this new technique and Cloud slashes Sephiroth, and then he does multiple slashes to Sephiroth and Sephiroth opens up his body to the sky.

When Sora approaches Sora, Sephiroth talks to him about Cloud and sees the Keyblade. Sephiroth asks Sora that if he defeated the Key Wielder would he become Wielder of the Keyblade, seeing that the Keyblade was the strongest blade a person could have. Sephiroth attacks Sora for some time until in the end, Sora defeats Sephiroth and knows that Sephiroth could not wield the Keyblade. He tells Sora to tell Cloud that he is waiting at the crag they were fighting on. Sora does so and Cloud appears before Sephiroth. They engage in a battle and Tifa arrives later to see them fighting.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Undoubtedly the most mysterious character within the Marvel Multiverse. The One-Above-All has only appeared and been mentioned a few times. He is not to be confused with <a href=\"../29-29861/\" rel=\"nofollow\">One Above All</a>, the leader of the <a href=\"../../celestials/65-13343/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Celestials</a>, or any religious figures. The One-Above-All was first mentioned by the <a href=\"../../living-tribunal/29-6811/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Living Tribunal</a> when <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Strange</a> first encountered the entity. The-One-Above-All is often unofficially cited as Marvel's creator.</p><p>When his final confrontation with <a href=\"../../asteroth/29-43413/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asteroth</a> nearly left him dead, <a href=\"../../beta-ray-bill/29-6139/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beta Ray Bill</a> was restored to life by a mysterious, glowing white-robed man (who was clearly one of the more anonymous representations of The One-Above-All.)</p><p>When the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a> journeyed far beyond the boundaries of existence they ended up in The One-Above-All's personal realm where he took the form of <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby</a>. After a short conversation with him The One-Above-All healed Reed's severely damaged face and sent them all home.</p><p>The One-Above-All's was seen taking the guise of a homeless man and was advising <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Parker</a> (aka Spider-Man) to be with his <a href=\"../../aunt-may/29-1780/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aunt May</a> who was dying at the time as well as telling Peter that death is a natural part of life and we as people must learn to let those we love who are dying go when the time has come. Peter did not listen to what The One-Above-All said.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The One-Above-All's first appearance is considered to be Doctor Strange #13, written by <a href=\"/steve-englehart/4040-42211/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42211\">Steve Englehart</a> with art by <a href=\"/gene-colan/4040-3792/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3792\">Gene Colan</a>. The character can often present problems to readers in the sense that meta layers can be interjected with the character on various occasions, subtle references to past writers and creators, and its often very ambiguous and vague nature. <a href=\"/mark-waid/4040-40724/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40724\">Mark Waid's</a> Fantastic Four run had an appearance of the character, and he cites <a href=\"/tom-peyer/4040-42589/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42589\">Tom Peyer</a> as the person who suggested The One-Above-All could be represented by a comic artist, specifically Jack Kirby. Writer and artist of the issue didn't want to be too specific though as to not put off casual readers or be too \"in-jokey\" and they managed to sneak in a cigar in an ashtray circumventing Marvel's policy of having no characters smoking but also recognize Kirby who was often told to have a cigar on him.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>The One-Above-All is Omnipotent (All Powerful), Omniscient (All Knowing), and Omnipresent (Everywhere). He is the most powerful being in the Marvel Multiverse. He exists beyond space and time. His power is unlimited, incalculable and immeasurable, he cannot be damaged in any way and he has control over all forms of energy. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Origin and History</p><p>======= </p><p>When the former X-Man known as Jubilee briefly moved to Beverly Hills, California, she came across a fellow mutant known as Shane Shooter. Shane instantly became attracted to her, flirting with her and imagining himself as her boyfriend.</p><p>Jubilee at first found him too rough around the edges, as he was a local gang member and didn't care much about his future. This motivated him to get his act together, and he soon began to act more like a contributing member of society. </p><p>When Jubilee needed help tracking down the person responsible for stealing her teacher's car, she went to Shane for assistance. The two of them confronted several gangs in the area until they found the culprits. As a result, a shootout started, forcing both Shane and Jubilee to openly use their powers in front of one another for the first time. They found cover behind several large crates, and defeated the gang with their energy powers after a heated battle. This resulted in the return of the car that belonged to Jubilee's teacher.</p><p>After the confrontation, Shane was given a chance to date the former X-Man. They went to a high school dance, but found it boring. Instead, they went out for burgers at a local diner. On their return back to Jubilee's aunt Hope's house, they came across Wolverine who came to visit his former sidekick. They were all caught up in a mob war, along with aunt Hope and her butler, Brad. The three mutants fought alongside Hope and Brad, but the result was catastrophic. Brad was shot and hospitalized as a side effect of the brawl, and Jubilee's aunt was presumed dead due to an explosion in her house. </p><p>When the battle was over, Shane had to part ways with his crush and friend, Jubilee. She returned back to the Xavier Institute with Wolverine, as her only surviving family member was missing after the blast. </p><p>Powers</p><p>======= </p><p>The full effects of Shane Shooter's mutant abilities are unknown. He has, however, been seen shooting energy-like bursts out of his fingertips with great accuracy.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Origin and History</p><p>======</p><p>Hope was involved with the crime world as a trained assassin, hired by mob bosses to perform certain tasks of expertise.</p><p>She made contact with the X-Men after hearing about her niece, Jubilee, whom she presumed to be dead when the girl's parents were murdered. Jubilee moved in with her aunt Hope, who was more than gracious to her. Hope gave Jubilee a cell phone, moped, and a completely furnished bedroom in order to make her stay more comfortable. </p><p>She would constantly sneak out of the house to go on missions with her butler and partner, Brad, while Jubilee was there. This oftentimes led to her coming home injured, causing her to lie to her niece about the situation. </p><p>Realizing that she had a responsibility to take care of her niece Jubilee, Hope decided to call it quits on the mob business. Her boss, however, became disgruntled, and sent his goons after both Hope and Brad. While Jubilee was at her new home with her friends Shane Shooter a Wolverine, Hope and Brad rushed into the house to get away from the criminals. Thus, a fight ensued. Jubilee and Shane used their energy powers to fend off the thugs, while Wolverine sliced their weapons and knocked them silly. Hope and Brad used acrobatics and firearms to defend themselves, until Brad was shot in the shoulder. Making a last ditch effort to end the battle, Hope ordered Jubilee and the others out of the house. As soon as they got to the sidewalk, the house blew up with the thugs and presumably Jubilee's aunt hope inside. </p><p>Jubilee left with Wolverine to go back to the Xavier Institute as a result. Hope, however, was mysteriously seen lying damaged but still alive in a park. Parts of her body were broken off to reveal that she was part robot.\"</p>",

    "description": "<p>Origin and History</p><p>=======</p><p>  Meg Devereux is a student of Payton Noble High School in Beverly Hills, California.  As a baseline human, she was subject to little or no knowledge of superheroics.  This changed, however, when the former X-Man known as Jubilee moved to the Hills in order to briefly live with her aunt Hope.</p><p>  On Jubilee's first day of classes at Payton Noble H.S., she befriended and confided in Meg.  Meg was known around school as a plain Jane, or nerd, due to her shy persona and poor self esteem.<br/></p><p>  When Meg witnessed Jubilee using her blinding powers on two girls that attacked her in the locker room, she instantly latched onto the once-mutant Chinese-American.  Hanging out with and following in Jubilee's footsteps, she gained a sense of self respect.<br/></p><p>  Just as soon as Meg befriended the former X-Man, she had to part ways with her, as Jubilee moved back to the X-Mansion after her aunt supposedly died in an explosion.  Meg learned many lessons during that time, though, and was also able to score a date with the school's most popular jock.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mazikeen is <a href=\"/lucifer-morningstar/4005-24232/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24232\">Lucifer's</a> assistant, she is a demon and daughter of Lillith making her one of the Lillim.</p><p>Physically Mazikeen appears like a normal human woman with long dark hair and fair skin, but as she is of the Lilim her form can change as she sees fit. What marks her out as a demon however is the left side of her face that appears to have simply rotted away, exposing teeth, brain, bone and missing an eye.</p><p>After Lucifer abdicated Hell in order to get back at Dream of the Endless, Mazikeen remained as one of the last demons refusing to leave Lucifer's side before he forced her to, after allowing her to accompany him. The pair settle in Los Angeles where they open a piano bar called Lux where she primarily function as head waitress. Shehas to disguise her features behind a white half-mask and a piece of cloth wrapped up in the manner of a hijab.</p><p>Their time in Lux is not left uninterrupted and several members of both Heaven and Hell visit the bar, setting off Lucifers long quest to escape predestination. While Luficer is attempting to regain his lost wings, a pair of Jin En Mok of the Shapeless come seeking the portal Lucifer left open into a new Creation. Mazikeen manages to kill one of the Jin En Mok by eating his heart, but she is mindcontrolled by the other. One of the other staff, a waitress called Beatrice, try to help by dousing them both in strong alcohol before threatening to set them alight, not knowing the otherworldly origins of the two. The Jin En Mok controls Makizeen's flesh to the degree that she dies in the fire.</p><p>After the fire is spent Makizeen is found by Jill Preston, recently empowered by a living deck of Tarot cards drawn by an angel. Jill heals Makizeen to full health, but not understanding the particular aesthetic qualities favored by demons, she restores both halves of Makizeen's face. Makizeen considers herself mutilated and swears revenge on Jill, to Lucifers mild amusement, before she leaves Lux in order to find a way to restore herself.</p><p>At the end of the series, Lucifer abandons Gods Creation entirely, leaving everything from it behind, including Makizeen, who is at the end dissuaded from killing Jill.</p>",

All the Instituters were captured, including Quagmire, and were 'reprogrammed', or basically brainwashed, to become productive citizens instead.

After flirting with an attractive plant worker Quagmire and the Blue Eagle got into an argument, who ended up punching Quagmire at the chemical facility. The Blue Eagle flew off to cool down and give Quagmire some space. During that time there was an accidental explosion at the plant and Quagmire accidentally inhaled a poisonous gas, saving thirty factory workers from certain death in the process. Blue Eagle was shocked at Quagmires heroics and ashamed at his own actions.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He went into a coma and was placed in a life support machine in the hospital of <a href=\"/squadron-city/4020-58637/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58637\">Squadron City</a>, under the supervision of former teammate<a href=\"/dr-decibel/4005-44525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44525\"> Dr. Decibel</a>. The dimensional portal that is contained within his brain suddenly got activated and he began creating extreme amounts of black gunk from his ears. The entire hospital got filled with the gunk and Dr. Decibel drowned in it. The Squadron member and leader Hyperion entered the hospital through the gunk and realized that the only way of stopping Quagmire from producing more gunk was by pulling his connection to the life support machine and thereby killing him. He did so and the black gunk completely disappeared, but together with Quagmire himself.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4492711\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4492711-0000000000000000000064554.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.26182432432432\" data-width=\"592\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 592px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:26.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4492711-0000000000000000000064554.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4492711\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" data-width=\"592\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4492711-0000000000000000000064554.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4492711-0000000000000000000064554.jpg 592w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134753/4492711-0000000000000000000064554.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4492711-0000000000000000000064554.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4492711-0000000000000000000064554.jpg 592w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134753/4492711-0000000000000000000064554.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" data-width=\"592\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Quagmire had, however, survived and not only appeared on Earth-616, coming through a through a portal into Earth-616.

This passage apparently reversed the effects of the behavior modification and restored his real nature as a ruthless thug.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He than came into conflict with the superhero <a title=\"Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)\" href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Wendell_Vaughn_%28Earth-616%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quasar</a> and the sorceress <a title=\"Jennifer Kale (Earth-616)\" href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Jennifer_Kale_%28Earth-616%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jennifer Kale</a>. Quagmire was eventually contacted by the Chief Examiner while in <a href=\"/the-vault/4020-43582/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43582\">The Vault</a>, and was freed. Quagmire approached Quasar's associate <a href=\"/kayla-ballantine/4005-43978/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43978\">Kayla Ballantine</a> and forced her through the Chief Examiner's black portal. He battled a tiny antibody which secretly sought refuge inside his body. He is as of present still at large on the Earth-616 dimension however his whereabouts and activities have not been recorded.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Appearance</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Height:</strong> 6'2\"</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Weight:</strong> 210 lbs</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Hair:</strong> Blond</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Eyes:</strong> Blue</p><figure style=\"width: 145px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4490237\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4490237-00000000000000000000854.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.88275862068966\" data-width=\"145\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4490237-00000000000000000000854.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4490237\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 145px) 100vw, 145px\" data-width=\"145\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4490237-00000000000000000000854.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4490237-00000000000000000000854.jpg 145w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4490237-00000000000000000000854.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4490237-00000000000000000000854.jpg 145w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 145px) 100vw, 145px\" data-width=\"145\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Quagmire is a young, muscular man with punk-rock look.

He wears grey leather trousers, black leather boots, an open red leather vest at the opening. He also wears black leather wrist bands. He has metal spikes on the boots and the arm bands as well as on the shoulders of his vest. The belt is studded metal on leather and connected to a chain that extends to the leather collar around his neck.

Anyone touching a victim who is stuck by the Darkforce matter will also get stuck. He can spread it across his path thereby obscuring people's sight, it can also suffocates people, leaving them Incapacitated at the end.

However the Avengers came over from their Earth's universe and fought the Squadron, freeing them from the Serpent Crown's mental control.</p><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611283-181303_67754_squadron_supreme.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1611283\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611283-181303_67754_squadron_supreme.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1611283\"><img alt=\" Enter the Squadron Supreme!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611283-181303_67754_squadron_supreme.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611283-181303_67754_squadron_supreme.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Enter the Squadron Supreme!\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611283-181303_67754_squadron_supreme.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611283-181303_67754_squadron_supreme.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Enter the Squadron Supreme!</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The second time that Cap'n Hawk and the rest of the Squadron were under mind-control was during the visit by the psionic entity and powerhouse known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/overmind/4005-4812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4812\">Overmind</a>. Although both the Cap'n and his teammates did try to fight the Overmind they were quickly overwhelmed by his powerful psionics. With the aid of the Defenders, who came from the same dimensional Earth as the Avengers did, they regained control of their minds and turned over the reign of the Overmind. Now left with the destroyed nations of their Earth, Cap'n Hawk visited his parents home in Mayflower Freedonia. His father James Sr had passed away during the time of Overmind's control of the worlds governments. The Cap'n was then given by his mother a new costume and battle-gear which James Sr had left for his son, never being able to say goodbye. His current costume in tatters, both in its material and reputation, the Cap'n became the Blue Eagle. Honoring his fathers past, forging his new future with the colors of a formerly glorious nation, both headed to a new era.</p><h3>Silver Age</h3><figure style=\"width: 486px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1611161\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.82304526748971\" data-width=\"486\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:82.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1611161\"><img alt=\" The Legend of the Eagle lives on\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg 486w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" The Legend of the Eagle lives on\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg 486w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg 480w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8842/1611161-squad4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The Legend of the Eagle lives on</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A steadfast supporter of the newly unveiled \"new world order\" concept, which fellow teammate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/power-princess/4005-6912/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6912\">Power Princess</a> had brought forward, the Utopia Project.

This led to a overly obsessed Lark, announcing that she would be marrying the Golden Archer. The Blue Eagle was shocked and realized that her behavior changed overnight, his paramour had completely changed her once love for him. Investigating further and discovering that the Archer had indeed behavior modified Lady Lark, a fellow member of the Squadron, and the woman he loved. Denouncing his crimes at a meeting and demanding his resignation of membership, the Blue Eagle urged the other Squadron members to vote him out.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The behavior modification which altered Lady Lark deeply affected Blue Eagle, anger and suspicion made him question the newer ranks of the Squadron.

Not liking the attitude or disposition of Quagmire, the Blue Eagle blew up on him even hitting Quagmire in public view. Leaving the site and flying to the sky for some fresh air and time to think about his out of control actions, the Blue Eagle returned to find that the plant had blown up. Quagmire had saved as many workers as he could even though his assistance put him in a coma. Feeling guilty due to not being present to help Quagmire during the crisis, the Blue Eagle turned his eyes even further on the newer members of the team.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1613104\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.81432360742706\" data-width=\"377\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 377px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1613104\"><img alt=\"Act of Justice or act of vengeance?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px\" data-width=\"377\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg 377w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Act of Justice or act of vengeance?\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg 377w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px\" data-width=\"377\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Act of Justice or act of vengeance?</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This proved to be the beginning of the Blue Eagle's downfall, following a few new members and witnessing them kidnap and un-behavior modify former villainous member <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shape/4005-19955/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19955\">Shape</a>.

    "description": "<p>The demon Pazuzu apparently began existence as an angel, one of 14 who became Lucifer's chief lieutenants when he led a rebellion against Heaven. Cast down into demonhood with his cohorts following Lucifer's defeat, Pazuzu, whether through literal or metaphorical rebirth, joined the ranks of the Annunaki, gods worshiped by the Sumerians, Assyrians and other Middle Eastern cultures. In this capacity, he often appeared as a winged lion-eagled hybird, although he also manifested as a scaled humanoid with ram's horns and appendages resembling a scorpion's tail and a serpent. Worshiped as a god of wind, storm and pestilence, Puzuzu brought both good and evil to humanity as his responsibilities and whims dictated, his southwest winds sending Mesopotamia nourishing rains and deadly disease alike.<br/><br/>He can manipulate strong winds from normal blasts to hurricanes. He has limited magical powers including teleportation and summoning demonic creatures. He is superhumanly strong and can supernaturally control the weather from lightning to hailstorms to thunder.</p>",

Twelve lives were cut short that day, and Thatchel wrongfully viewed mutants as evil, a misperception fueled by the evil Mephisto’s lies. Mephisto came to Thatchel and told him of a boy that walked alone between worlds, a boy with the power to bring them all together. Once the worlds had been brought together on Earth-616, Mephisto would use his power to destroy the X-Men of every reality. </p> <p> Thatchel successfully gave Hutch physical form, fed him, and gave him a puppy. He then introduced Hutch to Mephisto, who told the boy he could make it possible for him to exist in one reality with his mother and friends, as long as he performed a small favor for him. Hutch asked the Hell-Lord what he needed to do, and Hatchel informed the boy that the “evil” power inside of him would be used to draw the X-Men of all realities to Earth-616.

Hutch immediately recognized that she was his mother, and asked Magik where she had been. Magik explained that Hutch had not been conceived like others. He came into being not in one reality, but in between them all, each realm laying equal claim to him. When Hutch was born, he was born into every realm, and Magik lost him. Magik agreed to help Mephisto in order to be reunited with her son, even though it meant she played a part in the destruction of all creation. Hatchel attempted to reason with Hutch that by destroying one world, they saved the rest, but the boy became adamant that he did not wish to harm anyone. It was then that Kitty Pryde and the army of Xaviers confronted the trio, telling them that they were about t0 destroy existence itself. Magik attacked them, and told them that nothing would stop her reunion with her child. </p> <p>Mephisto revealed his true malicious intentions to Thatchel, revealing that the man had been a pawn in his game all along, and that Jamie Thatchel himself had been a mutant. Mephisto then set the man ablaze, before proceeding to harvest the souls of the X-Men from various worlds. Kitty Pryde located Hutch, and told him that he needed to return in between realities, and that his very presence on Earth-616 risked the destruction of reality. Magik found the pair, and attacked Kitty Pryde. Hutch understood that it was his destiny to be alone, and despite Magik’s protest, left Earth-616 to exist in between all realities, once again.   Mephisto was forced back to his own realm, and the X-Men of various worlds were returned to their homes. The alternate reality Magik asked Kitty Pryde to watch over Hutch should see ever see him again, and wished her goodbye, before disappearing. </p>     While Thatchel recuperated from immense burns in the institute’s medlab,    <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1115478\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0087719298246\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1115478\"><img alt=\" Alone\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg 684w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Alone\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg 684w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55780/1115478-3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Alone</figcaption></figure>  Kitty Pryde thought about the possibility that one small child had almost destroyed everything.

    "description": "<p>When it came time to create comics based on the superheroes in the 1950s, someone was needed to be in charge.  Known only as The Legend, he is the man that knows all of the dirty secrets the supes have in their closets.  Comics are the official version that the public sees about the supes.  In reality, the supes are a bunch of power-driven bastards that abuse it every chance they get.  The Legend is an associate of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40553\" href=\"/butcher/4005-40553/\" slug=\"butcher\">  Butcher</a>.  The knowledge that The Legend can provide to Butcher and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40551\" href=\"/the-boys/4060-40551/\" slug=\"the-boys\">  The Boys</a> helps when it comes time to blackmail the supes.</p><p>The Legend works out of the basement of Vinnie's Comics, although he originally worked for Vought America<br/></p>",

He somehow has been trained to sexually violate things on command. Otherwise he's a good doggy, except when he discreetly pees on the legs of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51106\" href=\"/the-homelander/4005-51106/\" slug=\"the-homelander\">Homelander</a>, the Ultimate Supe. All members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40551\" href=\"/the-boys/4060-40551/\" slug=\"the-boys\">Boys</a> get on well with the lovable Bulldog, even the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40558\" href=\"/female-of-the-species/4005-40558/\" slug=\"female-of-the-species\">Female</a> who shares an intolerance to contact with most, will affectionally scratch and play with Terror.  </p><p>At this stage it is unknown if Terror has received an injection of <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56318\" href=\"/compound-v/4055-56318/\" slug=\"compound-v\">Compound V,</a> the serum providing superpowers. Based on the fact that the writer is <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40644\" href=\"/garth-ennis/4040-40644/\" slug=\"garth-ennis\">Garth Ennis</a>, it could well be possible. Evidence from when Terror took a giant chomp out of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30095\" href=\"/crimson-countess/4005-30095/\" slug=\"crimson-countess\">Crimson Countess</a>' arm supports this theory.</p><p>It is too be noted that Butcher is extremely protective of Terror, despite the dog following him nigh everywhere and the nature of his work, there are few times when he tells Terror to run from the danger at present. Butcher also takes great offense to those that harm or threaten to harm Terror, as seen with Crimson Countess, and his meeting with Homelander in which the Truce between The Boys and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-51104\" href=\"/the-seven/4060-51104/\" slug=\"the-seven\">The Seven</a> is almost broken. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51108\" href=\"/jack-from-jupiter/4005-51108/\" slug=\"jack-from-jupiter\">Jack from Jupiter</a> is the presumed murderer of Terror at the Flatiron building. </p> <br/><h2>Creation </h2>Terror is created by writer <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40644\" href=\"/garth-ennis/4040-40644/\" slug=\"garth-ennis\">Garth Ennis</a> and artist <a data-ref-id=\"4040-2108\" href=\"/darick-robertson/4040-2108/\" slug=\"darick-robertson\">Darick Robertson.</a> Terror first appears in the The Boys #1 released in 2006.  <br/> <br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Brutal and aggressive bulldog, that is loyal to its owner Butcher. Terror has been trained to fornicate on Butcher's command. ",

His sidekick is <a href=\"../../laddio/29-67592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laddio</a>.Former leader of <b>Maverikz</b>. Recently, Tek Knight has developed a problem. He cannot stop...trying to have relations with people or things.</p><p>After a false tip to capture a terrorist army, <a href=\"../../payback/65-53161/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Payback</a> was flying back to their headquarters. He became aware of fellow teammate and robot, <a href=\"../../mind-droid/29-63561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mind-Droid</a>'s rear end. He tried having relations with him in mid-flight and was suspended from the team. He has since been going at it pretty much non-stop with anything that will suffice (and even things that wont). He tried going to a psychiatrist and even ended up trying to have his way with the doctor's coffee cup and cat. Luckily Tek Knight was able to send off Laddio on a mission to \"prove himself to be a man\" in order to remove the temptation. He also tried with his butler Thomas, something surrounding his ear. Thomas was very loyal to the Vernon family but left and told the newspaper that he was sexually assaulted by his master. The newspaper nicknamed him \"Homo Hero\". He came to the attention of <a href=\"../../the-boys/65-40551/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Boys</a> when they were investigating the death of <a href=\"../../stephen-rubenstein/29-67602/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steve Rubenstein</a>. He pushed them out of his house when they were asking too much questions but they returned and ended up with his mask to explode because of Female when he almost shot Butcher and Hughie.</p><p>Unlike other super heroes in the Boys universe Tek Knight does not gain his powers from <a href=\"../../compound-v/18-56318/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Compound V</a> instead he uses technology.</p><p><a href=\"../../swingwing/29-46901/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swingwing</a> serves as the stand in version of Nighwing. Formerly he was Tek Knight’s side kick Laddio, but set out on his own once he reached a certain age.</p><p>It is interesting to note that Tek Knight, Swingwing, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67601\" href=\"/talon/4005-67601/\" slug=\"talon\">Talon</a> had a threesome that led to the dissolution of Tek Knight and Swingwing’s friendship.</p><p>Tek Knight eventually retires but saves a woman and her child from a falling wheelbarrow full of bricks because it was hit by an asteroid rain. In his last dying moments, he envisions himself saving the Earth from an asteroid as big as Texas, and dying heroically by having sex with it. This is just the cover story for his death, as after a post mortem it is revealed he had a huge tumor on his brain which caused his weird desires. He was nice but boring.</p><p>It would appear that Tek Knight is a fusion of <a href=\"../../batman/29-1699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman</a> and <a href=\"../../iron-man/29-1455/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man</a>, being rich and having an old butler like both, using an armor suit like Iron Man, but having a sidekick and cave based head quarters like Batman.</p>",

    "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The ape-cyborg character named Ape-X was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mark-gruenwald/4040-41607/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41607\">Mark Gruenwald</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paul-ryan/4040-3253/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3253\">Paul Ryan</a>, and first appeared in Squadron Supreme #5.

She later received behavior-modification by the Squadron Supreme and joined the team, though the treatment eventually led to a psychotic reaction.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While a member of Squadron Supreme she formed a close relationship with <a href=\"/tom-thumb/4005-13862/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13862\">Tom Thumb</a>, assisting in developing and implementing technology essential in reaching the Squadron's goals. After Tom died of cancer Ape X began to create a robotic version of him, presumably out of a longing for his company. She was unable to complete the project do to a psychotic reaction triggered by conflicting imperatives forced on her by the Squadron's behavior modification process, triggered when she observed a new member of the Squadron Supreme breaking team policies.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Appearance</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Height: </strong>3'4\" (head to trunk)</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Weight: </strong>160 lbs</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Hair: </strong>Brown (body is totally covered)</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Eyes: </strong>Brown</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Powers and Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ape-X possessed super-human intelligence and the powers of speech. She also had great mechanical aptitude, and scientific knowledge. She created the pacifier compound used in \"gumdrops\", the popular term used for the pacifier pellets used by law enforcement officials to tranquilize lawbreakers.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Equipment and Paraphernalia</h2><p>Ape-X used a life-supporting chair for locomotion as well as offensive and defensive capabilities, having various weapons and options incorporated into it. One version had tank like wheels while another had the capacity to fly via thrusters.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Complications</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Having been Behavior Modified by the Squadron, the ex-Institute of Evil members are unable to break the law for any reason, betray any Squadron member for any reason. Their minds are no longer truly their own. Ape-X found herself in a complex issue- she followed the Institute loyally, but fell in love with Tom Thumb, and finds herself unable to reveal Moonglow's actions of espionage to her fellow Squadron compatriots. This caused her to have a complete mental breakdown due to the two extremes, one of mental blocks by the behavior modification, and the other due to her authentic beliefs in the Squadrons goals.</p>",

Olivia had strong doubts about the attack on the Squadron believing they had truly helped her and that her feeling towards Dr.Spectrum were deeply sincere.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4486200\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4486200-0000000000000ff.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"1.4019138755981\" data-width=\"209\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 209px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4486200-0000000000000ff.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4486200\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" data-width=\"209\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4486200-0000000000000ff.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4486200-0000000000000ff.jpg 209w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4486200-0000000000000ff.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/4486200-0000000000000ff.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" data-width=\"209\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the ensuing battle Foxfire ran towards Nighthawk who was standing over the defeated Hyperion. Then came the critical moment as <a href=\"/\">Nighthawk</a>, in the process of convincing the injured Hyperion to dismantle <a href=\"/\">Project Utopia</a>, became the victim of <a href=\"/\">Foxfire</a>’s grief over <a href=\"/\">Doctor Spectrum</a>’s injuries. Foxfire used her powers to cause decay to his heart, rotting <a href=\"/\">Nighthawk</a>’s heart, causing him to have a heart attack and thereby killing him and putting a halt to the battle. However as Olivia ran back to Dr.Spectrum to assist him, Mink repaid her with her claws right through <a href=\"/\">Foxfire</a>’s back. The Mink's claws sliced her from the back causing severe internal bleeding and she died in the arms of the man she loved.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Foxfire was an adventurer form Earth-712 who possessed the ability to project a wave of Bio-Illumination from her hands that would cause the molecular half-life of most objects to start to accelerate at a sub-atomic level causing its hyper accelerated and rapid breakdown. She could also focus the wave and cause it to surround her hands, in this way having a more controlled and localized effect. She has also used her bio-luminescence \"sparks\" to blind opponents in the past.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Foxfire also seemed to have a degree of acrobatics and competent skills at combat.

She sported her bright blonde hair buzzed short with a flat top cut style. Originally she wore a more punk like outfit in greens and hot-pinks colors, torn-up leggings, and black smeared eyeshadow. When she joined the Squadron Supreme her look changed dramatically. More of a traditional \"superhero\" costume which consisted of a white body suit, high collared jacket, yellow boots, gloves and belt. She wore no mask but wore gold hoop earrings.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Complications</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Having been Behavior Modified by the Squadron, the ex-Institute of Evil members are unable to break the law for any reason, betray any Squadron member for any reason. Their minds are no longer truly their own. Foxfire herself is a complex issue- she followed the Institute loyally, but fell in love with Dr. Spectrum, and finds herself unwilling to attack him and his allies any longer. However sometime later this behavior modification was reversed.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p>",

A central irony of the series (of which Metcalf is fully aware) is that Metcalf's employer, respected businessman <a href=\"/edwin-alva/4005-67813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67813\">Edwin Alva</a> — who provides the resources Metcalf uses to create Hardware's hardware — is also secretly the crime boss who Hardware is trying to bring down.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure style=\"width: 180px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/638710-action_comics_872__2009_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-638710\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"180\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/638710-action_comics_872__2009_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-638710\"><img alt=\"Milestone Media\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/638710-action_comics_872__2009_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/638710-action_comics_872__2009_.jpg 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\"></a><figcaption>Milestone Media</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Created by <a href=\"/dwayne-mcduffie/4040-42450/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42450\">Dwayne McDuffie</a> and <a href=\"/denys-cowan/4040-11908/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-11908\">Denys Cowan</a>. Hardware was the first comic printed by <a href=\"/milestone/4010-538/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-538\">Milestone Media</a> and was one of it's flagship titles. While some critics dismissed Hardware as <i>“an angry black man lashing out at the corporate world,”</i> Curtis Metcalf and Hardware was much more complex that that. The series, according to the creator and primary writer of Hardware, Dwayne McDuffie, <i>“is about fathers and sons,”</i> and revolved primarily around Curtis’ relationship with <a href=\"/edwin-alva/4005-67813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67813\">Edwin Alva</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Originally, Hardware and the entire Milestone line of comics took place in the <a href=\"/dakotaverse/4015-55853/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55853\">Dakotaverse</a> which was a separate continuity and universe from <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics</a>; which printed the Milestone titles but did not retain any editorial or legal rights to the characters themselves. After Milestone Media stopped producing their comic titles, Hardware entered a \"comic limbo\" for several years. Recently, Hardware and the Milestone characters have undergone a revival and have been merged into the <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics</a> universe.</p><h2>History</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Curtis Metcalf was born in one of the poorest neighborhoods in <a href=\"/dakota/4020-56179/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56179\">Dakota</a>. His father was a cop, poor but proud that he protected and served the public. Curtis perplexed his parents growing up. His father tried to interest him in sports and athletics, but instead his son was more interested in taking apart a baseball and examining how it was constructed and what sort of materials it was made of, rather than hitting it with a bat.</p><figure style=\"width: 144px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/88853/1724073-1049400_alva_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1724073\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"144\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/88853/1724073-1049400_alva_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1724073\"><img alt=\"Alva, Father Figure/Nemesis\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" data-width=\"144\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/88853/1724073-1049400_alva_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/88853/1724073-1049400_alva_super.jpg 144w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Alva, Father Figure/Nemesis\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/88853/1724073-1049400_alva_super.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/88853/1724073-1049400_alva_super.jpg 144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" data-width=\"144\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alva, Father Figure/Nemesis</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the age of 12, his innate brilliance and intellect caught the attention of <a href=\"/edwin-alva/4005-67813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67813\">Edwin Alva</a>, head of Alva Technologies and considered one of the most brilliant inventors of the age.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Alva sponsored Curtis into one of the country’s most elite private schools. He graduated high school at 14 and earned his first college degree at 15. Curtis came to idolize and admire Alva who became more like a real father to Curtis than his own. Alva paid for Curtis’ next six degrees, in return all he asked was that Curtis come to work for him afterward.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Curtis was given his own lab, his own private staff, a practically unlimited budget, and a mandate to indulge whatever struck his fancy. In truth whatever Alva spent was a bargain; Curtis’ inventions would earn him billions in return.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After several years as one of Alva's most valued employees, Curtis approached Alva; believing that he should get a share of the profits from his inventions. To his dismay, Alva brutally corrected Curtis’ misconceptions that he in any way deserved anything. He wasn’t family. He was an employee. He wasn’t respected. He was useful. He was a cog in the machine. A machine that belonged to Alva. And that was all. Alva cruelly concluded with, <i>“This was an interesting experience. Rather like having one’s dog suddenly announce he’s displeased with his living arrangements.”</i></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Curtis was enraged and humiliated. He thought about quitting his job but found that his contract specifically forbade him from ever working for any rival or any other company other than Alva’s. Alva owned all of his inventions, even his future ones.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Curtis dug into Alva’s personal records, hoping to find something he could leverage against him. He soon discovered that his esteemed mentor, philanthropist, industrial giant, and pillar of the community was a crook. One of the biggest ones there was. He laundered drug money, he had connections to organized crime, he secretly manufactured illegal weapons and sold them to foreign governments. Most of the local politicians were bought and paid for.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Curtis secretly mailed his discoveries to various law enforcement agencies and even a few news media outlets. And sat back and waited for the shocking story to be revealed, the scandalous revelations, and the arrest warrants to be handed down. He waited a long time. And it never came.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><figure style=\"width: 662px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58245/1112652-hardware7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1112652\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2160120845921\" data-width=\"662\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58245/1112652-hardware7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1112652\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" data-width=\"662\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58245/1112652-hardware7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58245/1112652-hardware7.jpg 662w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58245/1112652-hardware7.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58245/1112652-hardware7.jpg 662w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" data-width=\"662\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Curtis realized that Alva was so powerful that he was beyond the law. But not Curtis’ reach. Cobbling together an impressive array of ordnance and a protective metal armored shell, Curtis fashioned himself as a mysterious and unstoppable high-tech armored warrior known as Hardware. He quickly became Alva’s number one nemesis; destroying his illegal facilities and demolishing his warehouses filled with illegal goods and drugs and weapons, mercilessly slaughtering Alva’s goons and security thugs by the dozens.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ironically, Hardware’s remarkable suit of armor and weaponry was facilitated by Alva’s own resources which Curtis secretly appropriated. Curtis was also approached by Augustus Freeman IV which was merely the alias utilized by an alien who had been stranded on the planet Earth since the 1800’s and would ultimately assume the identity of <a href=\"/icon/4005-47395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47395\">Icon</a> in the 1990's. Freeman believed that Earth’s technology had finally caught up enough to attempt to fix his lifepod with it’s interstellar communicator.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Although Curtis was unable to repair the lifepod, he was able to recreate and repair several pieces of technology from the pod including the inertial winder (a high-tech airbag) that would become the belt buckle later used by Raquel Ervin a.k.a <a href=\"/rocket/4005-16695/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16695\">Rocket</a> (Icon’s partner/sidekick) and appropriated several of the designs he gleaned from the inner workings of the lifepod for his personal use as Hardware.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Curtis’ double life as Hardware was eventually discovered by <a href=\"/barraki-young/4005-65294/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65294\">Barraki Young</a>; his friend and sometime lover. She was dismayed by his actions and castigated his ruthless campaign against Alva as shameful and selfish. Curtis slowly came to realize that his actions, although he perceived them as justified, was far from noble. He was in his own words, <i>“throwing a temper tantrum”.</i> His level of violence greatly diminished and he began focusing on using his technologies productively instead for destroying and killing.</p><figure style=\"width: 1500px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146654\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.77333333333333\" data-width=\"1500\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146654\"><img alt=\"All for One, One For All\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg 1500w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"All for One, One For All\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg 1500w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/1146654-milestone1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>All for One, One For All</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Although he continued to fight Alva on various fronts by battling the hitman <a href=\"/reprise/4005-68068/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68068\">Reprise</a> and the <a href=\"/system/4060-56077/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56077\">SYSTEM</a>, a shadowy and secretive criminal cabal that Alva was a member of; he also began working on helping and protecting Dakota and its citizens by fighting against such opponents like <a href=\"/deathwish/4005-59093/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59093\">Deathwish</a> and even allied with such notable heroes as <a href=\"/icon/4005-47395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47395\">Icon</a>, <a href=\"/static/4005-26578/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26578\">Static</a>, and the <a href=\"/shadow-cabinet/4060-56055/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56055\">Shadow Cabinet</a> in the <a href=\"/shadow-war/4045-56026/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56026\">Shadow War</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Alva was far from finished with Hardware and even forcibly recruited Curtis to help build a counter to Hardware by building Tiffany Evans' armored <a href=\"/technique/4005-59575/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59575\">Technique</a> suit. Despite his best attempts to sabotage the project, Curtis' efforts proved fruitless and Curtis was barely able to fight to a draw against Technique.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Alva then surprised Curtis by deducing his secret identity and confronted him in his own secret lab and admitted that he had seriously underestimated Curtis and his potential. But as Hardware, Curtis exceeded them by showing impressive tactical abilities, a ruthlessness to win, and personal courage. Alva proposed that he give everything that Curtis wanted: money, power, respect, even a new position as Vice President of Alva Technologies and his Heir Apparent. He even admitted that he would be willing to shut down his illegal enterprises and operations ... providing that Hardware serve to protect Alva's interests.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It was too good to be true. Curtis was sure that it was all just a con and was deeply afraid that he would once more become Alva's creature. Only this time, he would be a willing one.

    "deck": "The gallant Jiraiya, teacher of the 4th Hokage and Naruto, and taught by the 3rd hokage. This toad sage is historically known for creating techniques, summoning toads, a powerful legendary sanīn, and an extreme pervert.",
    "description": "<h2>General Information</h2><p>Birthday: November 11</p><p>Height: 191 cm / 6'3\"</p><p>Weight 87.5 kg / 193 lb</p><p>Hair: White</p><p>Eyes: Black</p><p>Ninja Rank: Kage candidate</p><p>Village: <a href=\"../../konohagakure/34-45367/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Konohagakure</a></p><p> </p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Jiraiya was a tall male ninja with very long spiky white hair, which he keep tied in a ponytail and two shoulder length bangs that framed the sides of his face. He had red lines running down from his eyes which made him look like he was crying. He wore a green short shirt kimono and matching pants; under which he wore mesh armor that showed out of the sleeves and legs of his outfit. His outfit was completed with hand guards, a simple black belt, wooden sandals and a red cloak. His forehead protector was different from other Konoha shinobi. It was horned and had a Japanese kanji, instead of the Konoha symbol, on it. He was almost always seen carrying a giant toad summoning scroll on his back.</p><p> </p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Jiraiya was widely known as a pervert and a voyeur. He referred to himself as a super pervert with no equal. He was never ashamed of his perversion, and sometimes he even seemed proud of it. Despite this, he disliked <a href=\"../../naruto-uzumaki/29-44238/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Naruto</a> calling him \"Ero-sennin\" or \"Perverted Hermit\" in the presence of others. His perversion was so great he even created a technique that would allow him to spy on nude women without being caught. Jiraiya had also been known to show off, even during a fight. He loved to strike poses and he became annoyed if he was interrupted while doing so. Despite this, Jiraiya was able to become extremely serious and perceptive when the situation called for it. He was a lover of peace and he hoped for the end of the violence in the ninja world.</p><p> </p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Jiraiya graduated the academy at just six years old and became the student of <a href=\"../../the-third-hokage/29-44513/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hiruzen Sarutobi</a> and then later became the teacher of Minato, the would be <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"///\">Fourth Hokage</a>.</p><p>Jiraiya is the author of a series of adult-themed novels, the very books <a href=\"../../kakashi/29-44243/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kakashi</a> adores so much. He uses his books as justification for peeping on women and paying for their services, saying he's \"researching\" for his next novel. He is also rather wealthy due to the success of his novels.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4747/144318-92295-sannin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-144318\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4747/144318-92295-sannin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-144318\"><img alt=\"Young Sannin\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4747/144318-92295-sannin.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4747/144318-92295-sannin.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Young Sannin</figcaption></figure><p>In his youth, Jiraiya mirrored Naruto. He was an orphan that was eager and energetic. Although not as gifted as his comrades, he made up for his lack of skill with sheer determination. Also mirroring Naruto is that his best friend, <a href=\"../../orochimaru/29-44259/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orochimaru</a>, was his greatest rival and would later be unable to stop Orochimaru when he fled the Leaf village seeking more power. Jiraiya's relationship with <a href=\"../../tsunade/29-44512/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tsunade</a> even mirrors Naruto's friendship with Sakura, seeing that the two are close but Tsunade never returns Jiraiya's affections.</p><h3>Growing Up</h3><p>When Jiraiya got older he went to the mysterious Myouboku mountain to train with the ninja frogs/toads (the very same that he now summons) in the art of Senjutsu. There he was told of a prophecy by the Great Sage, where he'd wander the world and write a book, but he'd also not only become a pervert without equal but also an incredible ninja. He was then told that his students would bring about a revolution that will bring peace to the world or utterly destroy it, and that Jiraiya would have to make a difficult choice. After leaving Myouboku mountain, Jiraiya fought along-side Orochimaru and Tsunade in theThird Great Shinobi war. This would lead to a confrontation with the infamous leader of the Rain Village, <a href=\"../../hanzo/29-47834/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hanzo</a>, who'd dub the three the \"<a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/sannin/4060-45212/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45212\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sannin</a>.\"</p><p>During this time in the Rain village, he'd meet three Rain orphans: <a href=\"../../konan/29-46822/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Konan</a>, Nagato, and <a href=\"/yahiko/4005-75588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75588\">Yahiko</a>. They asked the Sannin for some food and Jiraiya gave them his. The orphans started following the Sannin and Konan used the wrapper from the food to fold Jiraiya a flower, but their presence started to annoy Tsunade who told them to go away. Orochimaru at which point suggested that the kindest thing they could do was to kill them since their lives as orphans in a war-torn country will consist of nothing but misery, but Jiraiya was outraged at the comment and told Tsunade and Orochimaru to return to the Leaf village without him. Jiraiya then took the orphans under his care for three years to teach them how to survive on their own, and even decided to teach them ninjutsu.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554737-13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-554737\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7675\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554737-13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-554737\"><img alt=\"Training the Rain Orphans\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554737-13.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554737-13.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Training the Rain Orphans</figcaption></figure><p>Jiraiya first noticed Nagato's Rinnegan after Nagato and Yahiko were almost robbed. The Rinnegan is the same eye technique that the first ninja and inventor of the ninja world possessed. The Rinnegan is said to be the most illustrious of the three eye techniques, said to be a tool of god that can either bring salvation or reduce everything to nothingness. Nagato blacked out and killed the thief and was greatly remorseful afterwards and had to be comforted by Jiraiya. Jiraiya told him that he doesn't know if what Nagato did was right or wrong, but Yahiko may have died and protecting his friends is the right thing to do. He would also tell Nagato that pain is something that everyone shares and is what makes people be nice to one another. Nagato didn't quite understand, but Jiraiya told him that he would when he grew up. During the training, Jiraiya noticed that Nagato could use all six chakra types and mastered every technique Jiraiya taught him. Then after three years of training, the orphans were finally able to defeat one of Jiraiya's shadow clones. Jiraiya realized that they were now strong enough to take care of themselves. But before he returned home, he told them that they needed to work together to improve their village.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/195913-100915-jiraiya.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-195913\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.675\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/195913-100915-jiraiya.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-195913\"><img alt=\"Jiraiya's Genin Squad\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/195913-100915-jiraiya.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/195913-100915-jiraiya.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jiraiya's Genin Squad\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/195913-100915-jiraiya.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/195913-100915-jiraiya.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jiraiya's Genin Squad</figcaption></figure><p>Some time later, Jiraiya trained a group of Genin, one of them being Minato. The two were very close and both shared much admiration for the other. Jiraiya later left the Leaf Village to explore the world and write his books, and Minato became the Fourth Hokage while he was gone. When Jiraiya wrote his first book it was basically a story about his life, but in the book he called himself Naruto. Jiraiya gave Minato a copy of the book and Minato greatly enjoyed it, as he told Jiraiya his opinion of it he told him that he and <a href=\"../../kushina-uzumaki/29-50361/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kushina Uzumaki</a> want their son to be just like Jiraiya and that they were going to name their son \"Naruto.\" He was also asked to be Naruto's godfather.</p><p> </p><h3>Jiraiya's Grand Entrance</h3><p>Jiraiya first meets Naruto after the Third Hokage prolongs the Chunin exams so the Genin can acquire new abilities and heal their injuries, inadvertently interrupting Naruto's training with <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/ebisu/4005-90623/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90623\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ebisu</a> (Jiraiya was caught peeping on women in a nearby bath house). Not knowing who Jiraiya was but quickly realized how powerful he is by witnessing him easily defeat an angered Ebisu, whose a special Jonin, Naruto hounded Jiraiya to be his teacher. Jiraiya tried to ditch Naruto a few times, but later accepted once Naruto used his \"Sexy Jutsu\" technique. Seeing that Jiraiya only agreed when Naruto made himself look like a beautiful naked girl, he got angered and accused Jiraiya of being nothing more than a little pervert, which greatly annoyed Jiraiya who replied \"I am NOT a little pervert!!! ...I'm a <i>big</i> one.\"</p><p>When the Sand and Sound Villages attacked the Leaf Village, Jiraiya made a grand (albeit late) entrance by crushing one of the giant snakes with his giant frog summoning. After the 3rd Hokage's death, Jiraiya was offered the position of <a href=\"../../hokage/65-50942/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hokage</a> by the village elders, but turned it down saying that he'd be horrible. They wouldn't take no for an answer, saying that only one of Konoha's three legendary ninjas could be the next Hokage... which got Jiraiya to go out looking for Tsunade who left the village many years ago and has since become hard to find. He had Naruto travel with him so that he could look for Tsunade and train Naruto at the same time.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337877-103499-jiraiya.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-337877\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1010362694301\" data-width=\"386\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 386px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337877-103499-jiraiya.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-337877\"><img alt=\"Facing Akatsuki\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" data-width=\"386\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337877-103499-jiraiya.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337877-103499-jiraiya.jpg 386w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Facing Akatsuki\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337877-103499-jiraiya.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/337877-103499-jiraiya.jpg 386w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" data-width=\"386\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Facing Akatsuki</figcaption></figure><p>During this, Jiraiya and Naruto have a run in with <a href=\"../../itachi/29-44260/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Itachi</a> and <a href=\"../../kisame/29-44996/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kisame</a>, members of the criminal organization called <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/akatsuki/4060-45002/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45002\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akatsuki</a>. They originally tried to distract Jiraiya with the temptations of a beautiful woman and capture Naruto, but Jiraiya saw through the trick and intervened. Itachi and Kisame were originally somewhat frightened to face Jiraiya, but they were willing to fight him They were about to fight until <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/sasuke-uchiha/4005-44241/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sasuke Uchiha</a> demanded that he be the one to kill Itachi. Both Jiraiya and Kisame knew of the Uchihas' family problems and they waited so that the brothers could settle things. After Sasuke was beaten and needed help, Jiraiya used a technique called Toad Mouth Binding that caused Itachi and Kisame to flee for their lives, even forcing Itachi to use potentially his most powerful Mangekyou Sharingan technique in a bid to escape: Amaterasu.</p><p>He and Naruto found Tsunade when they went into a restaurant. Tsunade was very surprised to see him, but even more surprised to find out that she is to be the next Hokage... which she turns down, saying that only a fool would want to be a Hokage, which greatly annoyed Naruto who demanded retribution and Tsunade decided to teach him a lesson so they went outside where Naruto lost... badly. Realizing that Orochimaru came to her trying to make a deal, Jiraiya asked her out for sake so they could talk in private and Jiraiya showed both great concern for the choice she was thinking of making, and warned her what he'd do if she helped Orochimaru. However, Jiraiya was too trusting of his good friend (and maybe a little too drunk) to notice Tsunade slip a drug in Jiraiya's drink and run off. Jiraiya returned to Tsunade's apartment the next morning, hardly able to stand or throw a kunai straight (as noted since he tried to throw one at <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/shizune/4005-50174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50174\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shizune</a>).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/331428-110795-gamabunta.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331428\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75142857142857\" data-width=\"350\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 350px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/331428-110795-gamabunta.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331428\"><img alt=\"Sannin Battle\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-width=\"350\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/331428-110795-gamabunta.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/331428-110795-gamabunta.jpg 350w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sannin Battle\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/331428-110795-gamabunta.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/331428-110795-gamabunta.jpg 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-width=\"350\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sannin Battle</figcaption></figure><p>Despite being drugged and not able to fully control his chakra, he came to Tsunade's aid against Orochimaru and <a href=\"../../kabuto/29-44523/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kabuto</a> after she attempted to betray Orochimaru. Due to his poor chakra control attributed to the drugging, his techniques weren't working right. He used Swamp of the Underworld to sink Orochimaru's summon, but couldn't make it as big as he wanted to. He then confronted Orochimaru and Orochimaru attacked, Jiraiya tried to defend himself with Needle Guardian, but that too wasn't working the way he wanted it to. Despite stabbing Orochimaru's foot, Orochimaru was able to expose and bite Jiraiya's neck after elongating his neck. The two talked and their ideals of a ninja conflicted, Orochimaru believing a ninja to being a warrior whom uses ninjutsu and Jiraiya believing a ninja to be a warrior whom endures. Orochimaru commented on why Jiraiya was training an idiot, saying that he must like to train others like himself, but Jiraiya rebutted that it's not fun to train geniuses. Orochimaru decided to kill Naruto and Jiraiya leaped after him but got slammed into the ground.

Despite this, Jiraiya still enjoys playing the occasional prank on Naruto and pulling his chain.</p><p>While training Naruto, Jiraiya first takes away the seal that Orochimaru placed on Naruto and teaches him how to walk on water, a technique Naruto was having a problem with. Jiraiya already knew about the <a href=\"../../kyuubi/29-46398/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kyuubi</a> sealed within Naruto and attempts to teach Naruto how to control the demon's chakra while teaching Naruto to summon frogs/toads, which was somewhat successful... until he used too much of the demon's chakra and accidentally summoned the gigantic chief toad Gamabunta, whom was not happy to be summoned by someone that he deemed beneath him, metaphorically speaking. Jiraiya then decides to teach Naruto the Rasengan, a technique Minato actually taught him.</p><p>After the two and a half year time skip, Jiraiya taught Naruto how to utilize his Shadow Clones strategically, create a more powerful version of the Rasengan, improved his taijutsu, and how to combat genjutsu. He may have taught him much more, since Tsunade made the comment that Jiraiya packed Naruto full of power.

Tsunade says that she's sorry for putting Jiraiya in such bad situations and says that the Third Hokage always intended for Jiraiya to succeed him as Hokage, but Jiraiya assured her that she's better suited than he is. Tsunade tells him that if things go bad she'll come to his aid immediately, but Jiraiya told her that as Hokage it's vital that she stay in the Leaf Village.

Jiraiya was curious as to how both attacks were ineffective despite being unseen, but realized with the elder frogs that they are able to see what the others see.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554784-05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-554784\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0621890547264\" data-width=\"402\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 402px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554784-05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-554784\"><img alt=\"Frog Confrontation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" data-width=\"402\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554784-05.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554784-05.jpg 402w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Frog Confrontation\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554784-05.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/554784-05.jpg 402w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" data-width=\"402\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Frog Confrontation</figcaption></figure><p>Fukasaku suggested a tactical retreat and him and Jiraiya started discussing what they knew about the three while hiding. They realized that with their abilities and teamwork that they're forced into a corner but knew Jiraiya would win if he could separate them, however Fukasaku thought they should use genjutsu. Jiraiya isn't very good at using genjutsu and Nagato knew this so Shima and Fukasaku attempt to do their most powerful genjutsu, one based on using sound. Pein soon realized he was being put under a genjutsu but chased after where the sound was coming from anyway and found Jiraiya, but he was surprised by Jiraiya's Shadow Clone who used a Giant Fire Blast. Preta Path attempted to absorb it, which Jiraiya knew it would, keeping him occupied while Jiraiya used Swamp of the Underworld to capture Human Path. This left only Jiraiya and Animal Path, who attempted to use another summon, but Jiraiya kicked him in the chest and sent him flying. By this time, Shima and Fukasaku's genjutsu took effect, placing the Pein bodies in a clear water-filled box surrounded by 4 metal frog statues wearing armor and holding swords. Jiraiya told him that \"I wanted you to rise above the pain and conquer it, not use it to lead the world to ruin.\" In reality the three laid out on the ground paralyzed while Jiraiya stabbed each of them in the heart with giant swords.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/266637-138448-akatsuki-leader.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266637\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66237113402062\" data-width=\"388\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 388px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/266637-138448-akatsuki-leader.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266637\"><img alt=\"Battle of Gods\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\" data-width=\"388\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/266637-138448-akatsuki-leader.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/266637-138448-akatsuki-leader.jpg 388w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Battle of Gods\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/266637-138448-akatsuki-leader.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/266637-138448-akatsuki-leader.jpg 388w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\" data-width=\"388\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Battle of Gods</figcaption></figure><p>Shima and Fukasaku started coughing from singing, Jiraiya apologized to them and they started leaving... but then one of Pein's other bodies appeared behind Jiraiya and sent him flying through a wall, tearing off Jiraiya's left arm in the process. Two more of Pein's bodies appeared and pulled the swords out of the fallen ones and brought them back to life. Fukasaku deduced that one of them have the ability to resurrect the others. Jiraiya demanded to know who they are, but Pein replied that \"Pein\" is all six of them.</p><p>Though much of the resulting battle went unseen, it's shown that Jiraiya hid in a summoned frog's stomach, but was somehow followed by Animal Path whom impaled Jiraiya in his right forearm and shoulder with a black spike that extended from his arm. This Pein however died in combat but the spike that he stabbed Jiraiya with made him lose control of his chakra and the Rinnegan appeared ominously around him, but Fukasaku quickly pulled it out. Jiraiya thought that only Nagato had the Rinnegan, but the one body is Yahiko and wondered if Yahiko stole Nagato's eyes... but that wouldn't explain how the other five bodies have the Rinnegan as well. Looking at the the Animal Path's body, noticing it's headband fall off, Jiraiya realized that he fought him before due to a scar on it's forehead... and now that it came to his attention, he realized that he has met all of the other bodies before. He sent Shima with the Animal Path body back to Tsunade while him and Fukasaku left the frog's stomach to see if his new found suspicion is true.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101834-2721787692-images\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5101834\" data-ratio=\"0.56\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101834-2721787692-images\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5101834\"><img alt=\"His legacy.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101834-2721787692-images\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101834-2721787692-images 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"His legacy.\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101834-2721787692-images\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5101834-2721787692-images 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>His legacy.</figcaption></figure><p>Watching the Peins from the water, no longer in Sage Mode, Fukasaku unsealed a giant shuriken which he launched at <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/asura-path/4005-90614/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90614\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asura Path</a> from behind, but that Pein avoided it. Jiraiya suddenly realized at that moment what Pein really is, but that's when one of the other bodies attacked Jiraiya from underwater, crushing his throat, and the other 4 bodies leaped at him from behind and all five impaled him with the same black spikes that the Animal Path stabbed him with. Jiraiya started to slip in and out of consciousness with the spikes stuck in his body. He was remembering his life, how he believed that it isn't what one does in life that proves their worth, it's what they did before they died and saying that \"This isn't how the tale of the Gallant Jiraiya was supposed to end.\" Willing himself back to life, Jiraiya engraved a secret message onto Fukasaku's back to deliver to Konoha. When Asura Path destroyed the island Jiraiya was on trying to kill Fukasaku, Jiraiya sank into the depths. While sinking into the deep water, he came up with the perfect title for his next book: \"The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki\".</p><p> </p><h2>Powers/Techniques</h2><p>Jiraiya has displayed many <a href=\"../../jutsu/12-50943/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jutsu</a>s, such as:</p><p>--\"Dome Formation Method\" a radar-like ability where he can detect his opponent's slightest movement.</p><p>--\"Needle Jizou\" where his hair becomes steel-like spikes that wrap around his body for both defensive and offensive purposes.</p><p>--\"Fire Blowing\" where he breathes a continuous stream of fire at an enemy.</p><p>--\"Swamp of the Underworld\" where he creates a tar-like pit of various sizes beneath his opponents to trap and incapacitate them.</p><p>--\"Giant Fire Blast\" where Jiraiya blows a large continuous blaze.</p><p>--\"Hair Needle Barrage\" where he turns his hair into steel-like needles and shoots them at high rates of speed.</p><p>--\"Frog Transformation\" where he forcibly transforms his opponent into a tiny frog.</p><p>--\"Rasengan\" where he creates an intense ball of drilling chakra.</p><p>--\"Rasenrengan\" is where Jiraiya uses two Rasengans at the same time.</p><p>--\"Ultimate Rasengan\" where he creates a colossal Rasengan capable of hollowing a mountain.</p><p>--\"Shadow Clone\" where he creates a copy of himself that is capable of fighting and using techniques, but sufficient damage will make them disperse.</p><p>--\"Silhouette Flattening Manipulation\" where he fuses to another's shadow and controls their body and mind, the duration of this technique is however long he can hold his breath.

His summoning techniques include:</p><p>--\"Toad Mouth Binding\" where he summons the esophagus of a giant fire-breathing toad around himself and his enemies. With this, the enemies become stuck to the sticky insides and get covered in strong stomach acid, and tendrils can also reach from the \"walls\" to grab enemies that try to escape. It also provides excellent protection from outside attacks.</p><p>--\"Food Cart Destroyer\" where he summons a giant frog on top of his enemies to crush them.</p><p>--\"Toad Oil Fireball\" where a toad spews enough oil to cover a small village and Jiraiya ignites it with his fire.</p><p>--\"Deep Fryer\" with the assistance of Fukasaku and Shima: Jiraiya spews a tidal wave of oil that Shima ignites with her fire and Fukasaku makes hotter with his wind.</p><p>--\"Toad Gourd Prison\" where Jiraiya transports his opponent into a lake of highly corrosive stomach acid.</p><p>He is able to summon many frogs/toads, some of which have been:</p><ul><li>An unnamed size-altering frog which he and others can travel in.</li><li>A unnamed small bottle-shaped frog.</li><li>A gigantic sword-carrying frog named <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/gamahiro/4005-90825/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90825\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gamahiro</a>.</li><li>An unnamed toad that wears heavy armor.</li><li>A small toad he uses as a scout named <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/gamakichi/4005-59042/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59042\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gamakichi</a>.</li><li>A large unnamed toad that he rides on.</li><li>A half frog/half scroll that he keeps in his stomach that contains Jiraiya's and Minato's secrets named Geratora.</li><li>A building-sized toad that carries a large spiked weapon and a shield named Gamaken.</li><li>The gigantic chief toad himself, Gamabunta.

As his first grandchild, he tend to spoil her. She would join the Ninja Academy and join the team of <a href=\"/third-hokage/4005-44513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44513\">Hiruzen Sarutobi</a>, along with <a href=\"/jiraiya/4005-44511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44511\">Jiraiya</a> and <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a>. She would excel in both medical jutsu and chakra control. In their battle with <a href=\"/hanzo/4005-47834/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47834\">Hanzo</a>, the leader of the Hidden Rain Village, he called them the Sannin, a title that would make them living legends. One of her own personal legends was her lack of all luck in gambling.</p><p>On her little brother's birthday, she gave him their grandfather's chakra crystal necklace for good luck, but he was killed that same day on a mission. She tried to protect to Hiruzen, now the Third Hokage, about the lack of medical ninja, but her former teacher told her that in war they didn't have the time to properly train more medics. The person who stood up to support her was Dan Kato. The two became eventually became lovers, and he shared her brother's dream to be Hokage. As a gift, she passed on her grandfather's necklace once more.</p><p>Yet on the next mission with Dan, he was mortally wounded. She tried to heal him on the field, but even her remarkable skill couldn't stop the bleeding. Her hands stained in her man's blood would be one of the primary causes of her hemophobia, fear of blood. With both her brother and lover dead, she had lost all hope for the village.

She was first introduced during the <em>Search for Tsunade Arc</em>, which began in Volume 16.</p><p>She first appeared in <i>Naruto</i> Volume 16, CH. 139 <i>\"That Person's Name is…!!\"</i>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Tsunade's name comes from the Japanese folktale of <i>\"The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya\"</i> (児雷也豪傑物語, Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari). Though named directly after the character Tsunade, the personalities are drastically different and her name sake was Jiraiya's wife.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Search For Tsunade Arc</h3><p>Tsunade had been wondering the Land of Fire with Shizune for several years. One day, she was approached by Orochimaru with his follower, <a href=\"/kabuto-yakushi/4005-44523/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44523\">Kabuto</a>. He arms had been disabled and sealed by Hurizen, who Orochimaru admitted killing. She was ready to kill him until he tempted her with the jutsu he had developed to revive her death brother and lover. She was given one week to decide, but would need two bodies as a sacrifice. On that same day, she was met by Jiraiya with <a href=\"/naruto/4050-34585/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-34585\">Naruto</a>, the <a href=\"/fourth-hokage/4005-45927/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45927\">Fourth Hokage's</a> son. He was there to tell her that she had been elected to take the title of Fifth Hokage. When she mocked hte idea, Naruto challenged her to a fight, and he nearly used the Fourth Hokage's Rasengan technique. Naruto lost the fight, but Tsunade made a bet with him. He had one week to master the Rasengan. If he won, he could have the charka crystal necklace of her grandfather.</p><p>During the week, Tsunade waited and would watch Naruto's failing training. As the end of the week arrived, Tsunade drugged Jiraiya, and went to meet with Orochimaru to kill him. With his arms disabled, Kabuto fought in his place, and proved to be a deadly enemy with medical jutsu. He tried to manipulate her fear of blood, but Naruto was able to stop Kabuto with the Rasengan. However, not before Kabuto had used his chakra scalpel to cut the muscles of Naruto's heart. She saved Naruto's life, and joined Jiraiya in fighting her former ally. Orochimaru fled before he could be defeated.</p><p>Tsunade passed along her grandfather's necklace, and she acknowledge his dream to be Hokage. They returned to the Leaf Village for her to take on the tile of Fifth Hokage. One of her first trails as Hokage was in the surgery of Rock Lee. The likelihood of survival was slim, but she used intense research with the regeneration techniques she saw from Kabuto to raise his chances.</p><h4>Sasuke Retrieval Arc</h4><p>Soon after being appointed Hokage, Tsunade was alerted by Sakura Haruno that Sasuke Uchiha had defected from the village to side with Orochimaru. With much of the high ranking Jonin away, she gave command of the retrieval mission the Shikamaru Nara. He formed his team and left to capture Sasuke. Not long after, Rock Lee ran off to aid them soon after his surgery.</p><p>The retrieval mission was a failure and many of the members were near death. Tsunade directed the treatment of the ninja and their lives were saved. As Naruto left with Jiraiya for two years of training, that would protect him from the <a href=\"/akatsuki/4060-45002/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45002\">Akatsuki</a>; Sakura came to Tsunade to become her apprentice. She agreed once Sakura passed her tests and would teach her both medical techniques and her charka enhanced strength.</p><h3>Kazekage Rescue Arc</h3><p>Naruto arrived two years later, but her desire to test his growth was halted as they received an emergency notice that the Sand Village was under attack by the Akatsuki and Gaara had been abducted. She sent Naruto, Sakura, and Kakashi to aid in his rescue. As added insurance, Tsunade sent Team 9 as backup. The team returned from rescuing Gaara and and with a clue as to Sasuke's location.</p><h3>Sasuke and Sai Arc</h3><p>Tsunade approved the mission to search for Sasuke, but <a href=\"/danzo-shimura/4005-62677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62677\">Danzo</a> had used his influence to put Sai, one of his Root agents on Team 7. Tsunade in turn put <a href=\"/yamato/4005-44245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44245\">Yamato</a> on as Kakashi's replacement to help control the Nine-Tails in Naruto.</p><h3>Five Kage Summit Arc</h3><p>Tsunade was in a coma-like state during the summit of the other Kages in the Land of Iron. She was looked after by Shizune.</p><h3>Confining of the Jinchuriki Arc</h3><p>Tsunade had regained consciousness as Naruto, Kakashi, and Sakura had returned. With threat of a war for the Jinchuriki, Tsunade had Naruto sent to train with Killer Bee on controlling the chakra of the Nine-Tails. All information about the war was kept from Naruto. Tsunade then took her proper place as confirming with the other Kages of the allied nations.</p><h3>Fourth Shinobi War Arc</h3><p>Tsunade remained at headquaters with A and Onoki to provide input when needed. Tsunade awas disturbed by the possibility that Dan may be among the reincarnated ninja fought by the First Division. She was later suprised by the news that some of the enemies in the battlefield contained the Nine-Tails' chakra.<br />When the news of Naruto and B's escape from their confinement reached the headquarters, the Raikage asked Tsunade to help him deal with the two. She left a clone at headquarters and summoned Katsuyu, taking another Katsuyu with her so that they are updated on any urgent matters at headquarters. When they stopped Naruto and B, Tsunadew was surprised by Naruto's control of the Beast. Naruto requested to Tsunade to let him and B pass, but she informed him that she can no longer make a decision independently, and must do what was best for the Alliance. Naruto tried to escape but was stopped by the angry Raikage, who voiced that he is willing to kill Naruto and B if they would not submit. Upon hearing this however, Tsunade told him that she would not allow him to do such thing.</p><h3>Ten-Tails Revival Arc</h3><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Using precise chakra control, Tsunade is able to focus chakra throughout her body giving her massive strength, enough to split the ground in two with just her finger.</p><h3>Tsunade's Jutsu:</h3><ul><li><strong><strong><b>Transformation Jutsu (変化の術, <em>henge no jutsu</em>):</b> </strong></strong>The Transformation Jutsu is a basic ninjutsu taught to in the Ninja Academy. It transforms the user into the appearance of another person and they can even speak as they do. This is a valuable skill for infiltration and deception.</li><li><strong>Summoning Technique (口寄せの術, <em>kuchiyose no jutsu</em>):</strong> This jutsu is a time-space manipulation jutsu and teleports a spirit animal instantaneously. The power of the creature depends on the chakra level and control of her summoner. By signing a contract. a ninja can select a particular type of animal. Tsunade holds a contract with the Slugs and can summon Katsuya.</li><li><strong><strong>Chakra Enchanced Strength:</strong> </strong>Tsunade's enhanced strength is based from her chakra control training. Chakra is gathered, condensed, and released at the point of impact.</li><li><strong>Heavenly Foot of Pain (痛天脚, <em>tsūtenkyaku</em>):</strong> Using her chakra enhanced strength techniques, Tsunade focuses chakra to the heel of her foot in an axe-kick. Upon impact, the kick will create a large crater. This will kill anyone that it makes contact with.</li><li><p><strong>Body Pathway Derangement (乱身衝 , <em>ranshinshō</em>): </strong>This is a high level technique that combines both taijutsu and medical-jutsu. With an exact strike to the base of the neck, Tsunade overwhelms the electrical signals of the nervous system with chakra converted into electricity. The shock of his strike temporarily rewires the nervous system. The target wont be able to properly control their own body.</p></li><li><strong>Mystical Palm Technique (掌仙術, shōsen Jutsu ):</strong> The Healing Jutsu is a medical-ninjustu technique where the user forces chakra to their hand to speed the natural healing to the target and it can use used on one's self.</li><li><strong>Chakra Scalpel (チャクラのメス, <em>chakura no mesu</em>):</strong> The Chakra Scalpel is a technique for a medical-ninja to focus chakra at their hands to create an extremely fine and long blade that can cut into the body of a target. It can be used for surgery or to cut muscle and nerves of an opponent.</li><li><b>Poison Extraction Jutsu (細患抽出の術, <em>saikan chūshutsu no jutsu</em>):</b>The Poison Extraction Jutsu allows the user to actually isolate and remove poisons from the blood. Using the Chakra Scalpel, an incision is made into the victim then chakra is used to force a large amount of medicinal fluid into the incision. This fluid serves to isolate poisons to then be drawn out of the body. In the process, the poison is removed and the damaged areas of the body are repaired. The extracted poison can now be isolated and analyzed to create an antidote.</li><li><strong>Yin Seal (陰封印 , <em>infūin</em>):</strong> This is an advanced Fūinjutsu sealing technique that Tsunade developed. This is performed by collecting and storing chakra over an extended period of time in the forehead. It will take on the form of a diamond. The release of this technique grants the user even more enhanced strength. Tsunade uses much of her stored chakra to maintain her youthful appearance.</li><li><strong>Yin Seal: Release (陰封印・解, <em>infūin: kai</em>):</strong> By releasing the Yin Seal, Tsunade gains enhanced strength and chakra flow to control to use various jutsu that boost the power of even her standard jutsu.</li><li><strong>Creation Rebirth (創造再生 , <em>sōzō saisei</em>):</strong> This is a technique that is the pinnacle of medical ninjutsu. By releasing the abundant amount of chakra stored in the Yin Seal, Tsunade is able to enhanced the speed of cellular regeneration within her own body. That includes both skin and vital organs. While this jutsu is active, it's impossible for Tsunade to die.</li><li><strong>Chakra Transfer Technique:</strong> This unique medical jutsu allows Tsunade to transfer her own chakra to the body of another person and adapt it. Tsunade has used this to transfer to Katsuyu to then transfer to the injured members of the village to be healed.</li><li><strong>Mitotic Regeneration: One Hundred Healings (百豪の術, Byakugō no Jutsu):</strong> This is a forbidden jutsu that requires mastery of the Creation Rebirth Jutsu, thus making it only possible for Tsunade to use. While similar to Creation Rebirth, this doesn't require hand seals to perform, and the speed of cellular growth is far faster. Even when she was impaled by two swords, they wounds heals almost immediately once they were were removed.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Jutsu Stats</h3><p>Ninja's are ranked by their proficiency with the various types of jutsu and other statistics.

However the events that led to the Kyūbi's rampage resulted in Biwako's death, and with Minato off dealing with an unknown threat, Hiruzen ordered the civilians to be protected while he prepared himself to fight the Kyūbi. Hiruzen and the other ninjas drove the Kyūbi out of the village, out of fury it prepared to shoot a Tailed Beast Bomb but Minato appeared and teleported the Kyūbi to a far off location. Hiruzen quickly followed after to help, but was stopped by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kushina-uzumaki/4005-50361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50361\">Kushina</a>'s barrier upon his arrival. He was forced to witness Minato and Kushina die as they sealed away the Kyūbi. Hiruzen would then once again resume his position as Hokage since Jiraiya wasn't available.

Hiruzen and the elders caught wind of this and Hiruzen began negotiations, which didn't work. The elders feared that if the Uchihas attacked that it would leave the village vulnerable and it was necessary to kill the Uchihas before a Fourth ninja war occurred. To add to Hiruzen's grief, he would later discover the horrible crimes that Orochimaru committed. But despite his anger, he couldn't bring himself to kill his student, allowing Orochimaru to flee the village.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1310957-12_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310957\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"273\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 273px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1310957-12_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310957\"><img alt=\"The Professor.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px\" data-width=\"273\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1310957-12_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1310957-12_1.jpg 273w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Professor.\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1310957-12_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1310957-12_1.jpg 273w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px\" data-width=\"273\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Professor.</figcaption></figure><p>When Naruto failed to graduate the Academy, he was tricked by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mizuki/4005-90820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90820\">Mizuki</a> to steal a scroll containing forbidden jutsu. Hiruzen was the first to see Naruto, but being a closet pervert, he was stunned by Naruto's \"Sexy\" jutsu which allowed Naruto to escape. Hiruzen sent out a squad to find Naruto and he watched with his crystal ball as Naruto was proven innocent and defeated Mizuki to protect his friend and sensei, <a href=\"/iruka-umino/4005-48969/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48969\">Iruka</a>.

Hiruzen talked to <a href=\"/kakashi/4005-44243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\">Kakashi</a> Hatake and told him about his new student.

What Hiruzen and the rest of the Leaf village didn't know is that the Chūnin exams was a cover for a united invasion by the Sand and Sound villages, the latter being Orochimaru's brain child. However what the Sand village didn't know is that Orochimaru impersonated their Kazekage after killing the real one. He then brought Hiruzen to a large rooftop where the <a href=\"/the-sound-five/4060-50177/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50177\">Sound 4</a> were waiting and constructed a barrier to stop them from leaving, or anyone to enter the fight.

Out of the coffins came the the First Hokage and the Second Hokage, Hiruzen's teachers, as Orochimaru's mindless undead servants.</p><p>Things were bad and, being almost 70, Hiruzen knew that he wasn't as powerful as he used to be. Hashirama and Tobirama charged at him, attacking separately, but Hiruzen was able to force them back. He then used \"Fire Dragon Napalm\" but Tobirama shielded himself, Hashirama, and Orochimaru with \"Water Encampment Wall\"; Tobirama then went on the offensive with \"Water Collision Destruction\", at which point Hiruzen used \"Earth Style Wall\" to protect himself. Hashirama raced in to close the gap, Hiruzen spat fireballs at him, but Hashirama deflected them. Hashirama then bested Hiruzen in taijutsu, at which point Tobirama used water to wrap around Hiruzen and drag him underwater to drown him, but Hiruzen escaped and climbed to the top of the rock wall he had created. Tobirama responded by shooting \"Water Jets\" to cut the wall down.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/236268-178728-the-third-hokage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236268\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2984293193717\" data-width=\"382\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 382px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/236268-178728-the-third-hokage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236268\"><img alt=\"Enma in Hand.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" data-width=\"492\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/236268-178728-the-third-hokage.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/236268-178728-the-third-hokage.jpg 382w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Enma in Hand.\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/236268-178728-the-third-hokage.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/236268-178728-the-third-hokage.jpg 382w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" data-width=\"492\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Enma in Hand.</figcaption></figure><p>Hashirama then used \"Birth of Dense Woodland\" to chase Hiruzen and bind him, but Hiruzen was able to summon <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/monkey-king-enma/4005-90833/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90833\">Enma the Monkey King</a>. Enma forced Hashirama and Tobirama away long enough to free Hiruzen by transforming into a large size-altering rod and breaking the trees. Hiruzen then took hold of Enma in his rod form and charged at Orochimaru, whom had brought out his Kusanagi sword. The two squared off, but their fight was interrupted by Hashirama and Tobirama, and Orochimaru managed to take Hiruzen down. Orochimaru walked up to the fallen Hiruzen, but Hiruzen brought Orochimaru to his knees and Enma reached out and tried to snap Orochimaru's neck, but it was an \"Earth Clone\". Orochimaru showed himself and Hiruzen kicked him away, then revealed that he had placed Paper Bombs on Hashirama and Tobirama and blew them up, but they pulled themselves back together due to the nature of their jutsu.</p><p>The fight stopped for a moment while Orochimaru revealed that he had gained an immortality jutsu by taking the bodies of others. Hashirama used \"Birth of Dense Woodland\" again, this time Enma protected Hiruzen by turning himself into a cage. Hiruzen knew the only way to win was to use Minato's technique to pull out the souls of Hashirama and Tobirama. He created some \"Shadow Clones\" to fight for him while he used the Reaper Death Seal.</p><p>Hashirama used \"Bringer of Darkness\" to envelop everything in pitch black and attack Hiruzen, but the Shinigami reached out through the \"Shadow Clones'\" chests and pull the souls from Hashirama's and Tobirama's bodies, revealing that the sacrifices used to summon them were <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/zaku-abumi/4005-52951/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52951\">Zaku</a> and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kin-tsuchi/4005-53154/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53154\">Kin</a>, two of Orochimaru's underlings. Orochimaru and Hiruzen began fighting again, Hiruzen knocked away the Kusanagi, but Orochimaru used Hidden Shadow Snakes to pull Enma from Hiruzen. Hiruzen got in close and grabbed Orochimaru to pull out his soul, however Orochimaru showed that he could control the Kusanagi even when it's not in his grasp and it stabbed Hiruzen despite Enma's effort to stop it.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3767520\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3767520-05.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.86987270155587\" data-width=\"707\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 707px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3767520-05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3767520\"><img alt=\"Elemental Mastery.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px\" data-width=\"707\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3767520-05.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3767520-05.jpg 707w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/378/3767520-05.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Elemental Mastery.\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3767520-05.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/3767520-05.jpg 707w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/378/3767520-05.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px\" data-width=\"707\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Elemental Mastery.</figcaption></figure><p>Orochimaru was surprised that Hiruzen didn't try to avoid it, whom revealed that he's going to die anyway.

Now a proud member of the Sarutobi Clan and The Hidden Leaf Village he finally made his peace with his father. It was now that Naruto approached him for training, Naruto had discovered he was a wind type and so was Asuma so Naruto asked if he could get any pointers, Asuma with a smile agreed but only if Naruto would buy Team 10 next meal, Naruto agreed.</p><h3>Land Of Fire</h3><p>After hearing about the attacks on villages that border the Land of Fire, Asuma was teamed up with his students to investigate. To his dismay, each of the said villages were completely wiped out. Upon returning to Konoha to report, he discovered that Sora, the son of his former Twelve Guardian Ninja teammate, Kazuma, was temporarily made part of Team Yamato while Sai was recovering.</p><p>Initially, Sora was rather indifferent with Asuma, despite the fact that he was once an ally of of his father, but after Asuma agreed to teach him, along with Naruto, how to effectively use wind element <a data-ref-id=\"4015-46239\" href=\"/chakra/4015-46239/\">chakra</a>, Sora began to warm up to him. Quickly, Asuma realised that Sora had unusually strong chakra, not unlike Naruto. As a further act of kindness, Asuma had Sora's broken tri-bladed death claw reforged with the same special material that was used to make his trench knives.</p><p>Sora, unfortunately, later learned the truth about Asuma's relation to his father, learning that it was Asuma who killed him. In a fit of rage, Sora attacked Asuma, using all he learned from Asuma against him. Asuma managed to incapacitate Sora, but Sora was still too filled with rage to listen to Asuma, causing him to run from the village.</p><p>Later during an attack on Konoha, Asuma discovered the true plan was to resurrect the four lightning chakra users of the Ninja Guardians, so they could use the Limelight jutsu to destroy Konoha. After being initially defeated by his former friend, Kitane, he managed to kill him and stop the completion of Limelight. He then discovered that the mastermind behind the invasion was none other than Kazuma himself. After a heated battle, Asuma managed to defeat Kazuma. As Kazuma died talking about the future of the Fire Country, Asuma calmly said that its future would be fine, because he would see to it that its true king remained safe.</p><h3>Death Of Asuma</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/225599-184278-hidan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-225599\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"1.16\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/225599-184278-hidan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-225599\"><img alt=\"Immortal Hidan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/225599-184278-hidan.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/225599-184278-hidan.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Immortal Hidan\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/225599-184278-hidan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/225599-184278-hidan.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Immortal Hidan</figcaption></figure><p>All this time Asuma had been working as a member of Niju Shotai, A team of ninja made by the hokage to track down and kill members of the Akatsuki. The team consisted of four people; Shikamarua, who was Asuma's student, Izumo Kamizuki, a well trained Junin and finally Kotetsu Hagane, another of Khonana top Ninja's. During one of their mission they had managed to track two of the Akatsuki members named, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44997\" href=\"/hidan/4005-44997/\">Hidan</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44998\" href=\"/kakuzu/4005-44998/\">Kakuzu</a> who where dropping off a bounty they had taken from the fire temple (one of the dead priest’s) as Hidan waited outside for his partner to do his business with the bounty collectors Nijy Shotai came across him. Shikamaru used his Shadow Technique to capture and restrain Hidan and the rest of the team set about finishing him off, It turns out that Hidan is actually an immortal and their attacks had done nothing to harm him, But he was still trapped within the Shadow technique, Then Kakuzu appeared and lunched an attack that broke off Shikamaru trap. As the battle raged on Asuma found himself facing Hidan and soon had the upper hand until Hidan cut Asuma along the arm and used his blood to start a ritual, as the ritual took place all the damage done to Hidan was now being done to Asuma, as Hidan was immortal the damage had no effect on him and it looked as if Asuma was done for when Hidan went to stab himself in the stomach and thus killing Asuma until Shikamaru trapped him again and made him walk out of his ritual circle, breaking the hold he had on Asuma.</p><p>Asuma powered his blades with wind and charged the immortal praying that cutting of his head would finally kill him, Asuma succeeded in the blow and as Hidan's head landed on the floor he began to laugh, even this had not killed him. Kakuzu once again jumped in and broke of the battle, reattaching Hidan's head with some of his own sewing thread and joined the fight facing Izumo and Kotetsu, this allowed Hidan to step back into the ritual circle, Shikamaru rushed to help his master but his charka was to depleted and while he was running Hidan made the final blow impaling himself and killing Asuma. Just then Choji and Ino arrived into battle and Kakuzu and Hidan made their escape leaving the death of Asuma in their wake. As Asuma died he told Shikamaru that one day he may be Hokage and that some times a knight must be sacrificed to protect the king. Shikamaru took Asuma's last cigarette and began to smoke it flicking the lighter cap back and forth and said it was the smoke that had brought tears to his eyes.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-153781\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"1.2875\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-153781\"><img alt=\"Death Of Asuma\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death Of Asuma\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1869/153781-180264-asuma.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death Of Asuma</figcaption></figure><p>The whole village could where mourning the fact of Asuma's death and all but one attended his funeral , Shikarmaru was busy coming up with a plan for revenge, when he was finished with his plans and had collected what he needed, he met up with Choji and Ino from team 10, they all had a strong connection to Asuma and wished to help their old team mate. But before they could leave the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50942\" href=\"/hokage/4060-50942/\">Hokage</a>(<a data-ref-id=\"4005-44512\" href=\"/tsunade/4005-44512/\">Tsuande</a>) appeared and said that they where not ready, this type of mission would need a four man group and then from nowhere Kakashi appeared and offered his help. Shikamaru changed his plan so that he could use Kakashi. It did not take long for them to find Hidan and Kakuzu again. So his plan started using the two knives that Asuma had used he pinned the shadows of the Akatsuki members, then he went on to use his Shadow Technique once again to give him complete control over the two of them, but before he could finish Kakuzu escaped. But Shikamaru had complete control of Hidan and now attacked Kakuzu with his own team mate, but it was all a ploy to corner the faster moving Kakuzu and allow Kakashi to sneak up behind him and attack him with Chordi. They thought they had won but infact Kakashi had only destroyed on of Kakuzu hearts. Kakashi and Team 10 where forced to come up with a new plan of attack. Now that they where the one's on the defense, they had to split them up once again catching Hidan Shikamaru lead him away from Kakuzu as Kakashi , Ino and Choji faced off against Kakuzu.</p><p>Leading him into the near by forest where Shikamaru had set up exploding scrolls preventing the Hidan from escaping. As they reached their destination Shikamaru's chakra ran out and Hidan went on the attack quickly cutting Shikamaru and starting his ritual, now seeing how smart Shikamaru was took no chances and stabbed himself in the heart, Shikamaru feel to the ground clutching his chest. But this once again was a trick, when Kakashi had struck <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44998\" href=\"/kakuzu/4005-44998/\">Kakuzu</a> with Chordi he had taken a small amount of blood as ordered and given it to Shikamaru as part of his plan, Knowing that his Shadow Technique was going to fail, Shikamaru had kept the blood and as Hidan went to strike threw the blood onto his weapon and then cut himself, So Hidan had actually stabbed Kakuzu in the heart and not Shikamaru, Hidan still had no idea that this had happened and as he came in close Shikamaru sprang into action and tried to chop of Hidan's head with one cut, but it was not deep enough. Having no choice but to use his shadow technique again. But this time it was much weaker and Hidan forced himself to attack Shikamaru who pulled out his trump card his end game technique that used all the exploding scrolls he had placed around to tied Hidan above the ground. Now with Hidan capture Shikamaru went to the floor below Hidan and activated a seal he had placed upon the ground before the battle and the ground beneath Hidan disappeared to reveal a pit. Shikamaru had planned this all along, this was to be the outcome no matter what had happened each move and step had lead to this moment. Shikamaru then told Hidan about the forest they where in it belonged to the Nara clan and only his clan where allowed to enter and leave it was protected not just by his clan but the actually forest itself, no one would retrive his remains this would be his final resting place. Placing one of Asuma's cigarettes in his mouth he let it with Asuma's lighter and then threw it making all the scrolls exploded at once and Hidan's body parts fell into the hole. Hidan's head lay at the top swearing revenge and Shikamaru caused a cave in and walked away.</p><p>Once back with the team he found Naruto was with them and he had delivered that last blow that killed Kakuzu, now with this behind them they returned to the village. Where Shikamaru finally visited Asuma's grave leaving the lighter with his old master as a final goodbye.</p><h3>The Return Of Asuma</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1488559-3307843_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1488559\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 413px\" data-ratio=\"0.80387409200969\" data-width=\"413\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1488559-3307843_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1488559\"><img alt=\"Ausma Back From The Dead\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1488559-3307843_3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1488559-3307843_3.jpg 413w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ausma Back From The Dead\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1488559-3307843_3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/1488559-3307843_3.jpg 413w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" data-width=\"413\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ausma Back From The Dead</figcaption></figure><p>Asuma is brought back to life during the 4th ninja world war by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44523\" href=\"/kabuto/4005-44523/\">Kabuto</a> using a forbidden technique \"the impure world resurrection technique\" this brings back the souls of departed back into the living realm.

    "deck": "Kurenai Yuuhi is a Jonin ninja and the leader of Team Kurenai. She has red eyes that has been mistaken to be a sharingan. She recently gave birth to her child.",
    "description": "<p><b>Bio</b></p><p>Not much is known about Kurenai's history prior to the manga.</p><p>What is known is that she is the #1 Genjutsu specialist in the village, and at the time of the manga's opening that she is newly appointed to her rank. She is an Elite Jounin in rank: the highest rank that can be achieved short of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50942\" href=\"/hokage/4060-50942/\">Hokage</a>. She is one of only four Elite jounin displayed in the village along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48904\" href=\"/might-guy/4005-48904/\">Gai</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\" href=\"/kakashi-hatake/4005-44243/\">Kakashi</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44514\" href=\"/asuma-sarutobi/4005-44514/\">Asuma</a>. Her skill in Genjutsu has been stated by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-50186\" href=\"/masashi-kishimoto/4040-50186/\">Kishimoto</a> in the databooks as being 'equal to Itachi', however despite matching him in this area, she falls behind him in all others. She is a strong willed and confident woman and her looks are renowned. She tends to dress in red and white clothing that and has a distinctive style that is likely reminiscent of the Japanese Geisha, a lady who lives their life by grace and tradition. However this means she lacks the body armour favoured by Asuma and Kakashi and thus must take more care in close combat.</p><p><b>Team Affiliation</b></p><p>Kurenai is the leader of team 8 whom are tracking specialists from elite ninja clans, an odd choice of leader until you realise how well Genjutsu and stealth synergises with intelligence gathering. She is well respected by her peers but has not shown great strength in battle, being more of a thinker and strategist, relying on illusion and sneak attack over brute strength. This is complimented by her lover Asuma, whom almost always fights by her side in battle. When fighting beside Asuma all the bases are covered, strength and close combat skill with long range illusions and disabling abilities.</p><p>Of all her students, Kurenai is shown to be closest with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44280\" href=\"/hinata-hyuga/4005-44280/\">Hinata</a>, whom she treats like her own child. She constantly strives to build Hinata's confidence in herself, as Hinata has a strained relationship with her real parents and clan.</p><p><b>Relationships</b></p><p>Kurenai is shown to be very close with Asuma, and she was often shown worrying about him when he was on active duty. In battle they complimented each other in combat perfectly. When questioned about their relationship they always tried to avoid the subject, showing that as working colleagues they were both concerned about how it might harm their careers of jeopardise their missions. However their relationship is something of a joke amongst the villagers as almost everyone has heard about it.</p><p>In recent chapters, Kurenai is shown pregnant with Asuma's child and therefore is not on active duty. This clearly shows that both Asuma and Kurenai were pursuing a relationship in secret.</p><p><b>Powers</b></p><p>Kurenai is shown to be a master of Genjutsu: mind magic that affects the brains and nervous systems of others. She can use this to manipulate opponents perceptions or movements, making them act and behave erratically. She can change the very world around them in their perceptions, and can even physically harm an opponent: either by rending herself and the environment invisible and attacking, or using it to make the opponents bodies believe they are being harmed or bound at which point the body reacts accordingly.</p><p>Kurenai is also able to utilise standard Shinobi techniques to a far greater level than most as an elite jounin. Therefore she is super fast and accurate, able to leap great distances and avoid attacks with superior agility.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Tenten is a young-tomboyish girl who was born and raised in the <a href=\"/konohagakure/4020-45367/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45367\">Village Hidden in the Leaves</a> in the Land of Fire. She attended the Ninja Academy and she graduated at 12 years-old and assigned to Team 9 with her classmates <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/neji-hyuga/4005-44526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44526\">Neji Hyuga</a> and <a href=\"/rock-lee/4005-44527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44527\">Rock Lee</a>. The ninja master they were assigned to was the Jonin, <a href=\"/might-guy/4005-48904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48904\">Might Guy</a>. Tenten specialized in summoning weapon jutsus and dreams to become a strong female ninja, just like Sannin of the Leaf Village, <a href=\"/fifth-hokage/4005-44512/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44512\">Lady Tsunade</a>.

She was first introduced during the <em>Chunin Exam Arc</em>, which began in Volume 4.</p><p>She first appeared in <i>Naruto</i> Volume 4, CH. 36 <i>\"Sakura's Depression\"</i>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><blockquote data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"small\"><p>\" <i>It's not because they're girls you know, Neji. It's just that those two are using kid gloves. It doesn't matter if you're a man or woman in battle. </i>\"</p><p><b>Tenten <i>\"Naruto\"</i></b></p></blockquote><p>Kishimoto has said in interviews that he prefers Tenten over the other four Hidden Leaf girls he designed because of how much he likes her look. Despite saying this, he has barely used Tenten. She has had no canon back story told, unlike the rest of the supporting cast; and none of her fights have ever been seen in the manga. Only the start and aftermath.</p><p>As with most of the Team Guy, she is given a primarily Chinese design. This is far more obvious in Tenten. She wears a pink Chinese-style top and pants, and her long brown hair is always shown wrapped in twin buns on the top of her head. Little of Tenten's personality or story is ever shown much in the manga. What little is shown is that she's a type of character who is determined to prove that a girl can do anything a boy can. This is an issue that she and Neji have disagreements about.</p><p>Tenten's name comes from the fact that she supposedly never misses a target she's aiming at. She has \"Ten\" shots and \"Ten\" hits. The original color images from the manga has shown her original outfit was colored blue, but they are color pink in the anime. Her outfit after the time skip is colored in the anime to match the manga design. Though she has started low in the fan polls of the <em>Naruto</em> characters, she has had slow and steady improvement in her rankings. In the previous three polls she has held the ranks of 29th, 24th, and 22nd.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Chunin Exams Arc</h3><p>Tenten is the only female member of Guy's team. She was first seen during the Chunin Exams arc where she made it to the preliminaries but lost to Temari, do to an elemental disadvantage.</p><h3>Kazekage Rescue Arc</h3><h3>Invasion of Pain Arc</h3><h3>Fourth Shinobi War Arc</h3><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>She has two main jutsu that she uses. The first is her summoning jutsu (Summoning Jutsu! Spiral Scrolls! Iron Barrage!). She grabs a single scroll and summons vast amounts of weapons to throw at her target , it can be considered a weak jutsu because the scroll obstructs her vision and thus lowers her accuracy to (min) 70/100. Her 2nd is the Rising Twin Dragons. She uses this to summon weapons faster and more efficiently, this jutsu, it should be added, does not obscure her vision and makes it easier to battle opponents that are slower moving and/or have bad eyesight, but it should also be added that she does not fare well with this jutsu when being attacked by someone that has a combo of great speed and eyesight, like say [[Neji Hyuga]]. She also has expert accuracy. This is proven by Might Guy by saying that once in a senbon throwing exercise she hit the bulls-eye 100/100 times in quick succession. She also plays a key role in 'Neji Style! Lee Style! TenTen Style! Guy Style! Team Guy Barrage!' which goes as follows : Team Guy lines up about 25 feet behind each other, first is Neji whom is facing the enemy, then lee, then Gai then TenTen, Tenten then transforms into a fuma shuriken which guy proceeds to throw at lee, who grabs it in mid air and sends it flying at Neji, but half way through it transforms back into TenTen (doing very tight mid air flips) she then lands on Neji's hands and is thrown into the air with chakra pulsed feet, does a flip and nails the target in the back of the head with her heel sending him or her flying strait to Neji whom then nails said target in the face with a byakugan strike!</p><h3>Jutsu Stats</h3><p>Ninja's are ranked by their proficiency with the various types of jutsu and other statistics.

The series is titled <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rock-lees-seishun-full-power-ninden/4050-62755/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-62755\"><i>Rock Lee Seishun Fullpower Ninden</i></a> (ロック・リー青春フルパワー忍伝, Rokku Rī Seishun Furupowaa Ninden) and it written and illustrated by Kenji Taira. It began publication in Shueisha's <i>Super Strong Jump</i> magazine on December 2010.</p><p>In the story Tenten and others are drawn in their time skip era outfits, but Rock Lee is trying to get Might Guy's attentions as if they have never met before. In the first chapter, Tenten is shocked to see Rock Lee try to imitate Naruto's Sexy Jutsu by just wearing a bikini. After Might Guy joins him, an infuriated Tenten attacks and defeats both of them in a brutal fashion.</p><h3>Anime</h3><h4>Naruto (2002)</h4><p>The <i>Naruto </i> anime series is the first direct adaptation of Masashi Kishimoto's original manga. It's produced by Studio Pierrot and first began airing in October 3, 2002. The series lasted for 220 episodes.

It's only been in the anime that the details of her battles is shown. For the filler arc episode in the first <i>Naruto</i> anime series that happened between Episodes 136-220. For these parts of the story, she was given hip holsters on both sides to hold her weapon scrolls. In the filler <i>Cursed Warrior</i> arc (Ep. 162-167), Tenten becomes overexcited at the idea they will be paid extra for the mission they were assigned.

    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b><i><u>Known Early Life</u></i></b></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kabuto's life is steeped in Mystery. The first Mention of him, he was found wounded at the batttle of Kikyo pass. He was taken in by a <a href=\"/konohagakure/4020-45367/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45367\">Konoha</a> Medical-nin, who taught him everything he knew. Kakashi's first statement when he sees Kabuto in the hospital with an unconscious Sasuke at scalpel point was <b>\"Oh, you're that medic's son\"</b> , making Kakashi seem more knowledgeable about Kabuto than he had previously shown.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At some point, he was put under the mind control of <a href=\"/sasori/4005-44999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44999\">Sasori</a> of <a href=\"/akatsuki/4060-45002/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45002\">Akatsuki</a> to spy on <a href=\"/orochimaru/4005-44259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44259\">Orochimaru</a>. Orochimaru discovered this and freed Kabuto from Sasori, seeing that Kabuto may have had some useful jutsu for him to take advantage of.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/318250-162850-orochimaru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-318250\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/318250-162850-orochimaru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-318250\"><img alt=\"Orochimaru, Kabuto's father figure\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/318250-162850-orochimaru.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/378/318250-162850-orochimaru.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Orochimaru, Kabuto's father figure</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Sasori however, would never find out that his jutsu had been broken by Orochimaru, as he would be killed by Sakura and Chiyo and then tell them where to go to meet a spy that he was supposed to meet up with, only to be impersonated by Yamato, who had no idea what Kabuto knew about Sasori.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Somewhere along the line, Kabuto joined Orochimaru in Otogakure (the Village hidden in Sound) and became somewhat of Orochimaru's right hand man, and was always Orochimaru's first choice when sending someone on a spy mission, as Kabuto was one of the few people in the Naruto universe who's true thoughts were never revealed anywhere, not in battle, not in speech. It is implied that even Orochimaru doesn't know Kabuto's true allegiances, as when he tells Kabuto to go capture Sasuke, who was in the hospital, that now would be the only chance he would have to stop him, as though he were pndering what Kabuto would do next. Yakushi was next seen as a member of Konoha, attempting to beat the Chunnin Exams along with the \"rookie nine\", consisting of Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Ino, Choji, Shikamaru, and Shino, Kiba, and Hinata. This was supposedly his 7th time in attempting to pass the exams.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">His first mention and appearance in the series, he is seemingly quite a nerdy kid. Upon hearing Naruto Uzumaki proclaim to the rest of the aspiring chuunin in the room that he would one day beat every one of them, he was forced to react to stop him from getting hurt, possibly as another way to force them into thinking he was their friend. Talking to them like a cocky superior, he asked them if they needed any help with the specifics as this had been his seventh time apparently in taking the exams. They were astonsihed to think that he was actually taking this exam again after all of it had gone by, but he told them that it was harder than they thought. He asked anyone if they wanted information on any of the new ninja, and of course Sasuke was the very first to ask him about <a href=\"/rock-lee/4005-44527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44527\">Rock Lee</a> and <a href=\"../../gaara/29-44258/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sabaku no Gaara</a>, but he wondered how Kabuto would possibly know about them.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180617-98828-gaara.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-180617\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180617-98828-gaara.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-180617\"><img alt=\"Sabaku no Gaara\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180617-98828-gaara.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/180617-98828-gaara.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Sabaku no Gaara</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He pulled out a deck of cards that he infused with his own chakra, and told them that with these he was able to carefully analyze his enemies and collect information on them. He also commented that sasuke knowing their names made this a much easier process, and first went ahead and told him abotu the one from the village that they were familiar with, Rock Lee. Lee was a specialist in taijutsu, but nothing else and had gone on multiple C-Rank missions with his team of Guy, Ten Ten, and Neji Hyuuga.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gaara, however, the mysterious ninja from sand was a different story, he had done multiple D-Rank missions, several C rank, and even one B-Rank mission with his team of Temari, Kankuro, and his sensei. Kabuto commented that there are very few genin that ever go on B missions, as often they're just simply far too tough for them. The thing that scared Kabuto the most though, and the others around him, was the condition that he had come out of all of these missions : unscathed. With this, Sasuke and Naruto felt slightly chilled, until kabuto quickly changed the subject, talking about how there was also a new village in the midst of their ranks, Otogakure, aka the Village Hidden in Sound. Kabuto stated that the three genin from there (Dosu, Kin, and Zaku) were simply just representatives of the no name backwater country of Sound.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/374342-153422-dosu-kinuta.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-374342\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.815\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/374342-153422-dosu-kinuta.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-374342\"><img alt=\"Dosu strikes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/374342-153422-dosu-kinuta.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/374342-153422-dosu-kinuta.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dosu strikes\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/374342-153422-dosu-kinuta.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/374342-153422-dosu-kinuta.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dosu strikes</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Upon hearing this, the three became violent, and attacked Kabuto where he stood. He dodged the kunai thrown from one, and wehn one blow was thrown towards his face he was able to carefully but swiftly move out of the way, his glasses broken. Looking at them, he wondered what had happened, in a slightly amused fashion, until he felt sick and began to vomit. The sound ninja bandaged up told him the secret to this, the amplifier on his arm, the sound from it had been directed by Dosu's chakra into Kabuto's ears, and thus disrupting the flow of some of the water and causing him to lose his balance and just go nausious. Kabuto picked up his glasses, and simply walked away after being told by the three patriotic genin that they would be the \"next big thing\" and that he would be killed if he got in their way again.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Little did the genin know, Kabuto was more in on their plan than they werem as compared to their relationships with Orochimaru, Kabuto was second to none. It was unrevealed what or how Kabuto did in the first part of the Chuunin exams, the written section, other than that he passed it, as he was able to assist Naurto and his friends in the Forest of Death, the second part of the exams. He had apparently strayed away from his team, which had already gotten their scrolls it would seem. Since he had no idea where they had been split up, apparently, he decided that he would help out Naruto and co. while they ran through the death filled woods on their way to the tower in the center of the forest with their scrolls. Along the way, Kabuto and Sakura noticed that they were going around in circles, as there had been the same branch pattern and rocks for the past few miles...it took the others a while to understand what this meant, but Kabuto knew what they were doing immediately : another genin was attemping to confuse them with genjutsu, to wear them out without fighting for their scrolls. A sly movement, if it weren't for them discovering what was going on due to Kabuto's smarts and the genin's miscalculations...they had thrown their kunai too early to try and take them down, and it was quickly stopped.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/421317-kabuto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421317\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.6072186836518\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:160.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/421317-kabuto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421317\"><img alt=\"Red Eyes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" data-width=\"471\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/421317-kabuto.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/421317-kabuto.jpg 471w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Eyes\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/421317-kabuto.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/421317-kabuto.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" data-width=\"471\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Red Eyes</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Naruto went out and called out their opponent, only to be warned by Kabuto that this was not a good idea, as there appeared to be a lot of them. In reality this was just another trick from the genjutsu using genin, and the multiple kunai were simply being thrown from one point in synchronization with his clones to make it seem as though there were many of them, from one point. Kabuto was about to tell them a plan to devise in order to make their strategy fall apart, when suddenly from out of the blue a kunai was thrown into his face, he was quick enough to dodge it, but it still scraped his face, and broke his glasses. It was in this moment that Kabuto's character went in depth, as his eye color changed to red, and he looked enraged with a passion. He has only mentioned this red eye technique once since this instance, only a few chapters later, saying that it was too dangerous for him to be a part of the third round of the chuunin exams with his red eyes. We still don't know if there was some truth in this statement, but for the most part Kabuto only left the exam to fulfill the orders of his true master...Orochimaru.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He met up with Orochimaru in an uninhabited area of the Leaf village at the moment, and discussed their plan. Sasuke was ill stricken in the hospital because of the curse mark set upon him by Orochimaru, and that now was the time to take him with them. Kabuto's mission was to kidnap the young boy and then bring him back for good. He also noted that if Kabuto was ever going to try and stop him, that the only way he could would be to kill Sasuke now, meaning that Orochimaru didn't even know what side the young boy was truly on. Kabuto froze for a moment at these words and looked at him with a very strange look in his eyes, only to tell him that he would never betray him. Upon arriving at the hospital he murdered all of the Anbu Stationed out side of Sasuke's hospital room, who was still quite fast asleep from the effects of the attempted curse mark seal from the elite jonin Kakashi, also his master. Finally, after all of the Anbu were actually dead, he came up to Sasuke, with a scalpel at his unconscious throat, ready to clip the tube that was over his mouth. Right when he was about to take him (or so we assume, he may have been trying to kill him and stop Orochimaru, or just do something else altogether, we still don't know his true motives) , he was suddenly stopped by Kakashi. Kabuto commented that maybe next time they may want to leave about ten anbu as opposed to six, as it was far to simple to kill them. Kakashi began fighting Kabuto in hand to hand combat, but it turned out that what Kakashi was fighting was an animated Anbu corpse made to look like Kabuto, using one of Kabuto's signature techniques it would seem, the Art of Dead Souls. In actuality the real Kabuto had been postering as one of the many dead Anbu on the ground, and when given the chance and Kakashi realized that he was just a shadow clone, Kabuto leapt out of the window, revealing the face under the anbu mas to be his.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><u>The Search for Tsunade</u></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kabuto accompanied Orochimaru to ask for Tsunade's help, at which they gave her a few days to decide. When the meeting between Tsunade and Orochimaru took place,</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kabuto was sent to kill anyone who'd interfere, but got scared and left when he saw Jiraiya. He then stopped Tsunade and Orochimaru, being a medical ninja he saw that Tsunade's technique was fatal, not healing. He decided to retreat to a more opened location to fight her, and she followed.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The two fought and Tsunade started to gain the upper hand, to which point Kabuto used his trump card... knowing her phobia of blood, he cut himself. Before he could kill her however, Jiraiya, Naruto, and Shizune appeared. He fought with Shizune and Naruto and was winning, but Naruto hit him with the Rasengan which put him down.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During a ruined assassination attempt by Orochimaru and Kabuto to kill Sasori, Kabuto was faced by Yamato and Sakura while Orochimaru fought the 4-tailed Naruto. Knowing that Orochimaru didn't want them dead because of their usefulness, Kabuto decided to heal Sakura who was struck violently by the out of control Naruto.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130928/2524866-830px_orochi_in_kabuto2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2524866\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56385542168675\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130928/2524866-830px_orochi_in_kabuto2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2524866\"><img alt=\"Becoming Orochimaru\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130928/2524866-830px_orochi_in_kabuto2.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130928/2524866-830px_orochi_in_kabuto2.png 830w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130928/2524866-830px_orochi_in_kabuto2.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Becoming Orochimaru\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130928/2524866-830px_orochi_in_kabuto2.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/130928/2524866-830px_orochi_in_kabuto2.png 830w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130928/2524866-830px_orochi_in_kabuto2.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Becoming Orochimaru</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After Sasuke absorbed Orochimaru, Kabuto would later meet with Naruto and co. to give them all of the information gathered on Akatsuki and it's members, he then revealed that he used his medical skills to graft portions of Orochimaru's body onto himself. When explaining why, he compared himself to Naruto and Orochimaru to the Kyuubi within Naruto. Kabuto said that he was always dependent on Orochimaru's power but he's going to make Orochimaru's power his own... he later claimed that Orochimaru's trying to take over and he's trying to resist. Before he left, he stated that he will seek revenge on Sasuke.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kabuto is later seen in the Waterfall village attacking Waterfall ninjas, he has also left behind corpses for the Leaf village to find which baffles Anko.

Tobi initially refused, but Kabuto resurrection someone that Tobi couldn't say no to, so Tobi agreed on the condition that Kabuto can't have Sasuke until after the war and he'll be supervising Sasuke at all times.

Tobi agrees to give Kabuto one Zetsu if he succeeds. Tobi then wanted to show Kabuto something. They go deeper into Tobi's lair which reveals a massive plant growing all through it, and Tobi reveals that it was grown using tissue that he stole from Hashirama.

This didn't go as planned and Itachi was coincidentally freed from Kabuto's control, in the mean time Kabuto decided to unveil his bargaining chip to the alliance that he used against Tobi... <a href=\"/madara-uchiha/4005-80827/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80827\">Madara Uchiha</a>. While Kabuto was having his fun, Itachi and Sasuke confront him, Itachi wanting to stop Edo Tensei and Sasuke wanting to talk to Itachi. Kabuto tried to enlist Sasuke's help against Itachi, calling him a common foe, but Sasuke saw things differently. The two brothers attacked Kabuto, but he proved too tricky and revealed a few surprises such as attaining <a href=\"/karin/4005-48053/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48053\">Karin</a>'s healing ability and <a href=\"/suigetsu-hozuki/4005-47862/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47862\">Suigetsu</a>'s liquifying ability, but also that he had ventured to Ryuchidou and learned Sage Mode. He started the fight using White Violent which created a bright explosion which momentarily blinded and deafened the brothers and Kabuto went to abduct Sasuke but was faltered by Itachi. Itachi decided to use a forbidden Uchiha clan jutsu, Izanami, to get Kabuto to undo Edo Tensei, but it takes a while to use once prepped. The brothers then counter attacked in unison, but their efforts failed. Itachi decided the only way to defeat Kabuto would be to use a one-time only jutsu, Izanami, which would decide fate at the cost of the user's eye. Kabuto pressed the brothers with another powerful attack, Inorganic Transmigration, making the cave itself come to life and impale Itachi with stalactites; Itachi survives thanks to being one of Kabuto's unkillable zombies, but Sasuke used Amaterasu to stop Kabuto from re-taking control of Itachi. During this fight, Itachi tried to appeal to Kabuto, causing him to recollect his past which led him to this point. Kabuto begins his attacks again, showing the bodies of those whose power he took for himself appear out of his torso. He used the Sound 5's abilities to subdue the brothers and then used Orochimaru's ability to try and absorb Sasuke, but the brothers helped each other and managed to stop Kabuto, until Kabuto sliced Itachi in half and was about to put a new control seal in Itachi, but Sasuke managed to stop him.

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Final Fantasy IX</h2> <br/><p>Vivi is a young Black Mage, who was first seen in Alexandria, trying to sneak into the play 'I Want To Be Your Canary'.  He managed to sneak in and see most of the play, but was eventually seen and chased by guards.  Vivi ended up getting mixed in with a bunch of Kidnappers and aided them in their escape with the Princess of Alexandria. Itisi revealed that the Princess wanted to go with them to seek help from her Uncle and that it was her Uncle who had hired the kidnappers in the first place.</p><p>Vivi discovered that Alexandria produced Black Mages that look a lot like him.  However, while most of them were mindless a few had \"awoke\" and went to create their own peaceful village. There Vivi found that the Black Mages at a certain point will die. He started to wonder if he would die at too.  </p>  <br/><br/><h2>Kingdom Hearts </h2> <br/>In Twilight Town there was a local rivalry between Seifer's gang &amp; Roxas' group of friends.  There, Vivi was a shy &amp; quiet youth who hung around with Seifer's gang of friends.  He was later possessed in an attempt to awaken Roxas to his former life as a member of Organisation XIII. <br/> <br/><br/><h2>Powers</h2> <br/><p>Vivi is a powerful Black Mage. He knows many offensive black magic spells including fire, ice, thunder, water, poison, demi (gravity), hp/mp drain, sleep, slow, stop, petrification and death. </p>His appearance is based on that of the 'Black Mage' job class in previous Final Fantasy games.",

    "deck": "Dr. Decibel was a member of the Institute Of Evil that was behavior modified and joined the Squadron Supreme.  He is an analogue of Green Lantern's old foe Sonar.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Nothing is known of Dr. Anton Decibel's early life, aside from the fact that he supposedly became a medical doctor, before being lured into a life of crime. At some point after becoming a criminal, he altered <a href=\"/lady-lark/4005-13863/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13863\">Linda Lewis</a>'s vocal chords so that she could produce a hypersonic scream. His motives for doing this are unknown, although as she was a popular and well-known singer, it is possible that he did it out of jealousy of her fame, or out of spite. At some point Dr. Decibel joined the Institute of Evil, as part of a game between the <a href=\"/grandmaster/4005-32735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32735\">Grandmaster </a>and the <a href=\"/scarlet-centurion/4005-11336/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11336\">Scarlet Centurion</a>, to fight the <a href=\"/squadron-supreme/4060-40479/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40479\">Squadron Supreme</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dr. Decibel was created by <a href=\"/mark-gruenwald/4040-41607/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41607\">Mark Gruenwald </a>and <a href=\"/bob-hall/4040-2889/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2889\">Bob Hall</a>, and first appeared in <a href=\"/squadron-supreme/4050-3511/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3511\">Squadron Supreme </a>#5 as a member of the <a href=\"/institute-of-evil/4060-42130/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42130\">Institute of Evil</a>. Dr. Decibel is inspired by Sonar, master of sound and one of Green Lantern's more formidable foes back when the Squadron Supreme limited series was first published (although he has fallen into obscurity in the years since then and gone from a competent foe who occasionally defeated Green Lantern to a joke character with little skill beyond bluster).</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dr. Decibel first appeared as a somewhat sinister doctor in the <a href=\"/institute-of-evil/4060-42130/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42130\">Institute of Evil</a>, prior to being put under a Behaviour Modifier (\"B-Modder\") machine by the Squadron Supreme. Afterwards, just like the rest of the Institute, he was friendly and no longer evil. Although Dr. Decibel was rarely seen, he appeared to be quiet and studious, becoming the team's medical doctor.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Utopia Principle</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Several months after the Squadron Supreme announced their plan to turn Earth into a utopia, Dr. Decibel was with the rest of the Institute of Evil when they captured the <a href=\"/golden-archer/4005-13864/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13864\">Golden Archer </a>and found out about Tom Thumb's recently invented Behavior Modifier machine. The Institute then captured several of the Squadron's friends and family, as the Squadron members had all recently unmasked, and attempted to use that as leverage against the team. The Squadron instead attacked the Institute, but were unsuccessful in defeating them. During the fight, Dr. Decibel fought and defeated Lady Lark, as he was immune to her sonic powers. The Institute then B-Modded the Squadron to become evil, but unfortunately for them they didn't realize that Tom Thumb had built a fail safe into the B-Modder so that no Squadron members could be affected by it. As a result, the Squadron sprung a surprise attack on the Institute, and this time they were successful.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Squadron then used the B-Modder on the Institute of Evil so that they couldn't commit any more crimes or betray the Squadron Supreme. With this done, they could afford to have the ex-Institute members join and increase their ranks. After joining, Dr. Decibel spent most of his time as the team's medical doctor, mostly overseeing <a href=\"/arcanna/4005-6116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6116\">Arcanna</a>'s pregnancy. Towards the end of the Squadron's reign,<a href=\"/quagmire/4005-44490/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44490\">Quagmire </a>was rendered in a coma thanks to some gas he had inhaled whilst saving some factory workers. Whilst Dr. Decibel was watching over Quagmire, he noticed some extra-dimensional slime, which Quagmire could produce as a result of his powers, beginning to appear, showing that Quagmire's higher brain functions were returning. Unfortunately, the slime kept appearing at an alarming rate, eventually flooding the entire hospital. Dr. Decibel didn't escape in time, and was suffocated before Quagmire could be stopped.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dr. Decibel had a device which could produce up to 300 decibels of sound, which he primarily used as an attack. He was also a skilled surgeon, notably altering Linda Lewis's vocal chords in order to give her super powers. He also was the Squadron's medical doctor whilst he was a member, so it can probably be assumed that he had a medical certificate and was a fully qualified doctor.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Complications</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Having been Behavior Modified by the Squadron, the ex-Institute of Evil members are unable to break the law for any reason, betray any Squadron member for any reason. Their minds are no longer truly their own.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">No alternate versions of Dr. Decibel have been seen, at time of writing.</p>",

He has struggled to prove that destiny is meaningless and to surpass the main house. Neji is an inheritor of the <a href=\"/byakugan/4055-44521/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44521\" data-mce-href=\"/byakugan/4055-44521\"> Byakugan</a>, a Hyūga blood-line technique. This provides him with a near 360-degree field of vision, telescopic vision, and the ability to see chakra. Although the Byakugan gives him a near 360-degree field he can see very far with it and he also has a blind spot in the lower part of his neck.</p><p>Due to the punishments his father received as well as his father's influence, Neji also came to resent the main branch. But this would change when Neji hears that his father voluntarily sacrificed himself for his twin brother who's a part of the main branch. He believed that his father Hizashi was forced to sacrifice himself for his brother.</p><p>He was formerly part of a three-man cell with fellow ninja and kunoichi Rock Lee and <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/tenten/4005-44520/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44520\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/tenten/4005-44520/\">TenTen</a> and was taught by <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/might-guy/4005-48904/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48904\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/might-guy/4005-48904/\">Might Guy</a>.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Outside of his initial feelings towards his clan, Neji has been shown to be extremely serious and mature for his age, and to have great self-control. In battle, he is able to stay relatively calm in most situations and carefully look at the situation at hand. As stated by <a href=\"http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Tsunade\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Tsunade\"> Tsunade</a>, Neji has excellent instincts, both on the battlefield and as a leader. When forced to make difficult decisions on missions, he shows himself able to make a decision through keen observation and analysis.</p><p>With this example of overcoming \"destiny\", as well as finding out the truth about his father's death soon afterwards, Neji abandoned the concept of inescapable fate. No longer bound by the idea that he was stuck at his current status, Neji resolved to become strong enough to never again lose a battle. To do so, he began putting more emphasis on working well with his team, and started to value a mission's successful completion and his team-mates' safety over his own betterment, even encouraging <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/rock-lee/4005-44527/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44527\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/rock-lee/4005-44527/\">Rock Lee</a> to continue pursuing his own dream. In addition, Neji began trying to remedy the estranged relations between himself and the main house members, most particularly by being kinder to his cousin <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/hinata-hyuga/4005-44280/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44280\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/hinata-hyuga/4005-44280/\">Hinata Hyuga</a>. His efforts seem to be effective, as he begins training with Hiashi, and, in Part II, even starts to wear traditional Hyūga robes.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Neji has noticeably long dark brown hair, typical of males in the Hyūga clan. In Part I, his hair reached the middle of his back and was tied back a few inches above the end, while two straps attached to a smaller headband underneath his ninja forehead protector frame the sides of his face. In Part II, he got rid of these straps, and allowed his hair, which is now longer, to frame his face instead. Like the rest of his clan, he has very fair skin and possesses the renowned Byakugan, which when activated, stimulates the veins and arteries immediately around his eyes to protrude more prominently. His eyes have a gray tint to them.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5094239-6864540082-Neji-.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5094239\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5094239-6864540082-Neji-.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5094239\"><img alt=\"Neji during the Chūnin Exams.\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5094239-6864540082-Neji-.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/5094239-6864540082-Neji-.jpg 640w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/5094239-6864540082-Neji-.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Neji during the Chūnin Exams.</figcaption></figure><p>In Part I, Neji was seen with a black headband that he wore snugly over his forehead. He wore a khaki shirt and dark brown shorts. He also had bandages wrapped around his right arm, chest, and right leg. In Part II, Neji abandoned the bandages and is clad in traditional white and black Hyūga robes. This may or may not have been to facilitate easier execution of his techniques, or to symbolize his warming relations with his clan. Neji is usually seen with a large tan and black drawstring bag, which he carries over his shoulder. Neji was also seen wearing a dull blue shirt with a mesh t-shirt under it.</p><p>Before his fight with Naruto during the Chūnin exams in Part I, Neji's facial expression was stern, hard, and cold. As the series progressed, however, his expression relaxes. He is seen smiling and chuckling at times. While still composed, Neji looks to be more calm, confident, and mature, rather than challenging and haughty.</p><h2>Chunin Exam Arc</h2><p>In the preliminary matches, Neji was paired up against Hinata. After exchanging blows, Hinata seemed to defeat Neji, only for Neji to reveal that he had plugged up Hinata's chakra points, rendering her Gentle Fist useless. He also hit a chakra point close to one of Hinata's vitals moments beforehand, putting Hinata in a critical condition. However, Hinata refused to back down, insisting that Neji, not she, was fighting against what could not be changed. Neji was about to administer a killing blow when most of the <a href=\"http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/J%C5%8Dnin\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/J%C5%8Dnin\"> Jōnin</a> in attendance stepped in to save Hinata. Neji was pitted against <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/naruto-uzumaki/4005-44238/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/naruto-uzumaki/4005-44238/\">Naruto Uzumaki</a> in the first rounds of the finals. Although Neji soon gained the advantage in the fight and cut off Naruto's chakra flow, Naruto was determined to fight against Neji, and prove that fate was not predetermined. Naruto didn't give up and defeated Neji with an uppercut after harnessing the power of the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kurama/4005-46398/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46398\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kurama/4005-46398/\">nine tailed fox</a> inside of him.</p><h2>Sasuke Retrieval Arc</h2><p>Neji was recruited as part of the-five person team to retrieve <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/sasuke-uchiha/4005-44241/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44241\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/sasuke-uchiha/4005-44241/\">Sasuke Uchiha</a> from the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-sound-five/4060-50177/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50177\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-sound-five/4060-50177/\">Sound Ninja Four</a>. Neji was chosen to be the rear lookout in the single file line <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/shikamaru-nara/4005-44247/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44247\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/shikamaru-nara/4005-44247/\">Shikamaru Nara</a> organized. When during the course of the mission the team was captured by <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kidomaru/4005-50181/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50181\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kidomaru/4005-50181/\">Kidōmaru's</a> webbing, Neji was able to free them, and sent them after the remaining members of the Sound Four while he himself fought the Sound Ninja. Kidōmaru was able to analyze Neji's defenses and found the blind spot in the Byakugan, proving to be a dangerous enemy. Neji realized that Kidōmaru was far more powerful than he was, but was determined to never give up, as he wanted to show those who considered him a genius that their faith in him was correct and to prove that he no longer surrendered to fate. Neji was severely wounded when Kidōmaru managed to fire an arrow through his chest. However, he was able to keep it from hitting his heart by moving at the last moment and deflecting it with his chakra. He then was able to push his chakra through the webbing and injure Kidōmaru. Once he was stunned, Neji finished him off with a flurry of Gentle Fist style attacks. He then passed out from his own injuries and was rushed back to the village when help arrived.</p><h2>Kazekage Retrieval Arc</h2><p>In Part 2, Tsunade sends Team Guy to help support <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/team-7/4060-44283/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44283\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/team-7/4060-44283/\">Team Kakashi</a> during the rescue of <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/gaara/4005-44258/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/gaara/4005-44258/\">Gaara</a>, who was now Kazekage of <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/sunagakure/4020-55739/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55739\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/sunagakure/4020-55739/\">Sunagakure</a>, and had been captured by the criminal organization the <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/akatsuki/4060-45002\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45002\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/akatsuki/4060-45002\">Akatsuki</a>. On the way there, Team Guy is attacked by Akatsuki member <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kisame-hoshigaki/4005-44996/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44996\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/kisame-hoshigaki/4005-44996/\">Kisame Hoshigaki</a>, who managed to trap Lee, Neji and Tenten with a Water Prison jutsu using Water clones, leaving the real Kisame to battle Guy. During that fight Guy opened the first six chakra gates to defeat Kisame. Lee and Tenten were saved by Neji who broke free from the Water Prison and saved the others.</p><p>Neji and his team arrived outside the Akatsuki headquarters a few moments before Team Kakashi, despite setting off a few days later. The squads find out that there is a barrier, and seals located in different locations that needed to be removed before they were allowed to enter. When the seals were removed, Team Guy had to battle a clone of themselves due to the trap laid out by the Akatsuki. Lee figured out that the clones did not tire, but lacked emotion and could not improve themselves. Neji and his team soon defeated the clones armed with this knowledge, and went back to help Team Kakashi, only to find Gaara dead. Lee and a group of others later witnessed <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/chiyo/4005-45015\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45015\" data-mce-href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/chiyo/4005-45015\">Chiyo</a> sacrifice her life to revive Gaara with a forbidden jutsu. Neji and his team returned to their village with Team Kakashi afterwards.</p><h2>Fourth Great Shinobi War</h2><p>Neji participates in the Fourth Great Shinobi War, alongside Hinata, under Kitsuchi's Second Company. He and the rest of the company were dispatched to the location where the White Zetsu army was mobilizing, and after Kurotsuchi and Kitsuchi together unearthed the White Zetsu army division that was travelling beneath them, Neji and his team mates began to engage them in combat. He and Hinata fight together exceptionally well, with combo techniques. After taking down a lot of them, he nearly gets caught in a surprise attack by one of them, who he then blows off by using the body blow technique of the Gentle Fist. There were too many Zetsu and it was turning into attrition warfare, so Neji was getting tired from the constant appearance of enemies. In spite of this, he shrugged off any medical attention and just chose to rest on Akamaru's back.</p><p>On the second day, the fighting went on. He was confronted by a reanimated Kidōmaru, though he was a lot stronger since the last time they fought. First, he releases his team mates trapped by his webbing, then proceeds to easily defeat him. But this activates a seal that leaves him and the other members of the Sasuke Recovery Team (Kiba, Shikamaru, and Chōji) comatose and takes their souls away from their bodies. They are then forced to fight the reanimated Sound Four until the eventual death of their actual bodies. Shino tries his best to keep them alive while they find a way to free themselves from the barrier.</p><p>Within the barrier, the four shinobi are confronted by Kidōmaru, Tayuya, Sakon &amp; Ukon, and Jirōbō, who are seeking revenge against them for their deaths. They seem to be gaining the upper hand at first, but realize that since they are reanimations, they won't be going down so easily. As time passes, their situation grows ever worse, until Shikamaru provokes them in order to get Naruto to sense their evil intentions and find the barrier.</p><p>Once Naruto finds the barrier, he begins to hammer away at it until it cracks, allowing Inoichi to rescue the four of them from the barrier and restore their souls back to their original bodies.</p><p>Now that Neji is back on the battlefield, he returns to battling the White Zetsu Army battallion until Naruto's Shadow Clone comes to finish off the remaining enemies.</p><p>After their battle is over, Neji and the rest of the Second Company are sent off to assist Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy in their battle against Madara, Obito, and a revived Ten-Tails. Once there, he, along with Hinata and his uncle, help protect Naruto from the attacks directed at him by the Ten-Tails, as a result of how crucial he is to the victory of the alliance in the war.</p><p>However, the attacks of the Ten-Tails prove to be too numerous, forcing Neji and Hiashi to move to protect the other shinobi in range of fire. Meanwhile, the Ten-Tails fires many wood projectile volleys at Naruto. Hinata tries to sacrifice herself to save Naruto, but Neji steps in to take the blow by himself, leaving him severely injured.</p><p>Naruto tries calling for a medic, but Neji resigns to his apparent death, and tells Naruto that his life is linked to many others, including Hinata's. When asked by Naruto why he would make such a sacrifice for him, Neji responded that it's because he called him a \"genius\" once. He then dies, finally knowing what it's like to willingly die for his friends, as his father once did. Upon his death, the Curse seal Jutsu of the Hyūga main family activates, sealing away his Byakugan.</p><p>After the war, his body is taken back to the Leaf Village, where he is given a proper burial.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Byakugan</h4><p>- The Hyūga family's kekkei genkai that makes their eyes seem the way they do. This technique allows for them to see the many chakra points in a person's body and pinpoint them to make their jutsu useless, and they can make themselves stronger, too.</p><h4>Eight Trigrams Sixty Four Palms</h4><p>- This technique allows Neji to move at a high speed and hit any sixty four chakra points of his opponent. This was even used on Naruto, when he fought him. He has total mastery over this taijutsu move.</p><h4>Eight Trigrams One-Hundred Twenty-Eight Palms</h4><p>- This is a technique that is much like the Sixty-Four Palms technique. Though this allows Neji to move even faster than the Sixty Four Palms technique allows him to move. Now he can hit 128 of his opponent's chakra points.</p><h4>Eight Trigrams: Heavenly Palm Spin</h4><p>- This technique is strong enough to deflect almost any attack that is used against him. That attack then sends the attack flying off with twice the power and intensity that it had.</p><h4>Eight Trigrams: Great Heavenly Palm Spin</h4><p>- This is just a stronger and bigger version of the Heavenly Spin Technique.</p><h4>Eight Trigrams: Three-Hundred Sixty-One Palms</h4><p>- This technique allows Neji to hit all 361 chakra points of his opponent. This is one of the most dangerous techniques in the Hyūga Clan. This technique can result in instantaneous death or Cardiovascular Collapse.</p><h4>Eight Trigrams: Empty Palm</h4><p>- This is a more focused version of the Great Palm Spin, just expelled out of his hand.This technique rivals wind gust techniques that Temari uses.</p><h4>Eight Trigrams: True Palm</h4><p>- This is an extremely powerful move in which he expels chakra out of his hand and can cause massive damage. This is a Mid to Long-range technique.</p><h4>Eight Trigrams: Eight Gates Bombardment</h4><p>- This technique allows Neji to close off the Eight Gates of Chakra. This technique is said to be an A-ranked Taijutsu, and is the most powerful and dangerous technique in the Hyūga Clan.</p><h4>Eight Trigrams: Mountain Crusher</h4><p>- This technique is just the Empty or True Palm used at Point Blank Range.</p>",

    "deck": "As a child, Lee had bad taijutsu and no ninjutsu or genjutsu skills, whatsoever. Later, once he became part of Team Guy, he became known as a Taijutsu Specialist. His goal is to be considered a splendid ninja despite his inability to use ninjutsu or genjutsu.",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Rock Lee was constantly mocked by his fellow students, while at the academy, because of his inability to use either ninjutsu or genjutsu, even failing to utilize the more simple techniques that all shinobi learn to use at a young age. That would mean all Lee had going for him was taijutsu, and even then that was only average. It seemed impossible that Lee would ever become a ninja, and anyone else in his rare situation would have giving in, but not Lee. Everyday Lee would push his body to the limits, by constantly training in taijutsu, giving him arduous training regimes, that if he failed to meet his promise for completing one task, he would train in an even more difficult task. It is this hard working determination, which has allowed Lee to succeed as a ninja.</p><p> </p><p>Ever since the academy, Lee has been under the watchful eye of <a href=\"/might-guy/4005-48904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48904\"> Might Guy</a>, the number one taijutsu specialist in Konoha. Guy saw something special in Lee, becoming proud when Lee was able to complete a task, and greatly appreciating his never gives up attitude. Lee also saw Guy as not just a sensei to him, but also a father figure, becoming extremely upset and angry whenever someone made fun of Guy. Lee was eventually signed to Team Guy, along with <a href=\"/tenten/4005-44520/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44520\"> Tenten</a> and <a href=\"/neji-hyuga/4005-44526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44526\"> Neji Hyuga</a>, during that time his appearance and personality greatly resembled Guy’s, such as wearing clothing like him and even having the same style hair cut. It was during this time that Lee developed a rivalry with Neji, believing that with enough hard work, someone like him will be able to surpass a natural genius, although Neji believed he is and always will be superior to Lee and his hard work was pointless.</p><p>This did not stop Lee, even when he was being beat by Neji in training; he carried on training to make himself stronger. Under Guy’s influence and tutelage Lee trained constantly in taijutsu, and in the style known as strong fist, that deals external damage to the body, such as breaking bones. Lee was able to master many of the styles most difficult techniques, such as the Front Lotus. These types of moves are known to put a lot of strain on the body, and while anyone can perform them, only the likes of Lee and Guy can deal with the strain that it puts on their body, because they have have been through the necessary training to handle it. Since his training, Lee has worn heavy training ankles weights, which increases his strength but decreases his speed to a point which is still considered incredibly fast by his peers.</p><p> </p><p>Upon taking these weights off, his speed increases greatly, to the point he becomes a blur and even Kakashi’s Sharingan found it hard to keep up. Lee is also a natural master in the style known as Drunken Fist, upon drinking even a single drop of alcohol, he becomes violently drunk and his fighting style is unpredictable, almost impossible to follow. In this state, he is constantly trying to impress Guy even if he is not around, and he will attack friend or foe. Lee has also learned to open up the first five of the Eight Gates, which is a difficult feat even for the most talented of ninja, upon opening these gates, his speed and strength are forcibly pushed past their natural limits, at the cost of his health.</p><p> </p><p>Lee is also very polite and respectful, referring to people in a very proper way. He is also very respectful to his opponents and carries a great sense of honor, to the point that his good-natured heart stops him from holding grudges, even forgiving <a href=\"/gaara/4005-44258/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44258\"> Gaara</a> and building a friendship with him, even after he crushed his arm and leg. Lee also believes that all ninja should show respect to there opponents and becomes angry when people fail to do so. He also believes that by not wanting something, only then will he be able to get it, as seen moments before his battle with Gaara. Lee also has deep feelings for Sakura, asking her to be his girlfriend. Lee has vowed to always protect Sakura, and because of her he has pushed himself even further. At first Sakura does not like this but in time she begins to care for Lee even bringing him flowers when he was in hospital.</p><p> </p><h3>Chunin exams:</h3><p>Rock Lee is first introduced during the Chunin exams, where upon first sight he seems to be nothing special, until, he is able to stop a kick from Sasuke and a disguised exam proctor. Sasuke is impressed by Lee, and later is challenged by him. Lee wanting to prove himself, by defeating another genius, after easily dispatching Naruto, Lee and Sasuke have a short fight, in which Sasuke is shocked by Lee. The fight is eventually stopped by Guy, just before Lee was about to use the Front Lotus.</p><p>During the second exam, this took place in the forest of death, Lee upon saving an endangered squirrel, stumbles across Sakura who was being attacked by the sound Genin, Dosu, Kin and Zaku. Lee was able to battle valiantly for a while, but was overcome by the numbers. After Sasuke drives them back, lee promises to Sakura that the next time they meet he will be stronger. During the final stages of the exams, Lee battled the violent Gaara in an incredible battle, in which Lee uses his most difficult techniques, even opening the first five gates, but he is ultimately defeated, having his arm and leg crushed, and is saved from death when Guy intervenes. After that the medics say that his life of a ninja is over.</p><p> </p><h3>Recovery:</h3><p>Lee would become deeply upset, that his life of a ninja was over, and that he would fail to reach his goal. This would not stop him, as even when he was in the hospital, he would sneak out to train, much to the shock of the medical staff and <a href=\"/sakura-haruno/4005-44242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44242\"> Sakura</a>, who believed he should be resting. When news that the legendary medical ninja Tsunade had returned, Guy saw this as hope for Lee, and that she could heal him. <a href=\"/fifth-hokage/4005-44512/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44512\"> Tsunade</a> inspected the damage, and even though his body had healed to a certain point, the damage was still great.</p><p>Tsunade gave Lee the choice of undergoing a surgery that only she could perform and if it succeeded, Lee would be healed. However, there was a fifty-percent chance he would die. Rock Lee had a tough choice, give up his life of a ninja or risk dying. This scared him greatly, but under the wise words and encouragement of Guy, Lee underwent surgery and survived. This only made him more determined to succeed.</p><p> </p><h3>Sasuke retrieval:</h3><p>During the retrieval of Sasuke, Lee suggests that Neji goes with, <a href=\"/naruto-uzumaki/4005-44238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\"> Naruto</a>, <a href=\"/shikamaru-nara/4005-44247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44247\"> Shikamaru</a>, <a href=\"/choji-akimichi/4005-44249/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44249\"> Choji</a> and <a href=\"/kiba-inuzuka/4005-44279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44279\"> Kiba</a>, but he himself is upset that he can’t go and help. Lee later explains to Tsunade why he wants to succeed as a ninja, even at the cost of his own life, saying that despite having no ninjutsu or genjutsu he could still become a great ninja. During this arc, Naruto is fighting <a href=\"/kimimaro/4005-44262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44262\"> Kimimaro</a>, of the sound five, and is about to be killed. At the last moment Lee arrives and kicks Kimimaro away, telling Naruto to go on, while he faces Kimimaro.</p><p> </p><p>At first Lee and Kimimaro are on equal footing, before Kimimaro starts to dominate that match, and right before he is about to kill Lee, he is stopped as Lee takes what he believes is medicine but is instead sake. Upon consuming it he becomes intoxicated and becomes unpredictable, even outclassing Kimimaro, who is forced to use his curse seal. Lee is overpowered and when Lee finally awakens, Kimimaro proves too much, even stopping the front lotus. Lee is saved by the interference of Gaara, who battles Kimimaro. The two are saved from death, when the illness of Kimimaro finally gets the better of him. Lee and Gaara then build a friendship.</p><p> </p><h3>Rescue Gaara:</h3><p>In part 2, Tsunade sends team Guy to help support team Kakashi during the rescue of Gaara, who was now Kazekage, and had been taking by the <a href=\"/akatsuki/4060-45002/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45002\"> Akatsuki</a>. Team Guy is attacked by Kisame, who traps Lee, Neji and Tenten in a water prison, using clones, while the Kisame battles Guy. During that fight Guy uses the first six chakra gates, to defeat Kisame. Lee and Tenten were saved by Neji who broke free from his prison and saved the others.</p><p> </p><p>Rock Lee and his team arrived outside the Akatsuki headquarters, a few moments before team Kakashi, despite setting off a few days later. The squads find out that, there is a barrier, and seals located in different locations, that needed to be removed, before they were allowed to enter. When the seals were removed, Team Guy had to battle a clone of them. Lee figured out that the clones did not tire, but lacked emotion and could not improve themselves. Lee and his team defeated the clones, and went back to help team Kakashi, only to find Gaara dead. Lee and a group of others witnessed, <a href=\"/chiyo/4005-45015/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45015\"> Chiyo</a> sacrifice her life to revive Gaara. After they all welcomed Gaara back, Guy was carrying a wounded Kakashi. Lee, seeing this as a training exercise, asked an annoyed Neji to jump on his back. Neji did not approve.</p><p> </p><h3>Pain’s invasion:</h3><p>During the invasion of Pain, Team Guy was on a mission, completely unaware of what was happening in Konoha. The team were traveling back, when Tenten said they should rest. Lee noticed Guy looking up in the sky and asked what was wrong. Guy said that the birds were fleeing from the village. Thinking something was wrong, the team decided to head to Konoha. Lee and the rest of his team eventually return to Konoha during the heat of the Naruto/Pein battle. Finding everything in ruins and many people either dead or injured. They also notice Hinata and get her medical treatment after finding Sakura. Lee and Neji then want to support Naruto but are told by Katsuya to not help because Naruto did not want them to get in the way. Lee is later seen with the rest of Konoha greeting Naruto after he had saved everyone. Later in the Kage summit arc, Lee is seen with the rest of the Konoha 11 deciding on killing Sasuke. Later, he Kiba and Sai are with Sakura as they are there to find and defeat Sasuke. However, Sakura puts all three to sleep after Sai tries to stop them. Lee is later seen, when Naruto tells the Konoha 11 that he alone will defeat Sasuke.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Rock Lee, despite having no talent whatsoever in either ninjutsu or genjutsu, is still a very skilled ninja. Through hard work and a determination that is arguably even greater than that of Naruto's, he has been able to succeed. Lee is a taijutsu specialist and utilizes a style called Strong Fist, that deals blunt, external damage to the body. Such as breaking bones. This style has been shown to put a lot of strain on the body when using the more advanced techniques, to a point where only those who have pushed there bodies to the limits, can deal with these moves.</p><p>Lee is also incredibly strong and fast, even when wearing his ankle weights, his speed is still impressive. Once he takes them off, his speed vastly increases, which often surprises his opponents. Rock lee has pushed his body so much, and is so determined to succeed, that even when unconscious, he is still able to stand, train, and even fight. An example being in his fight with Gaara, despite being knocked out, and having his arm and leg crushed, he was still able to get up, through pure muscle memory.</p><p>One of his signature moves is the Primary Lotus, in which by opening the first gate, he knocks his opponent in the air, constricts them with his bandages, and pile drives his opponent head first into the ground. The Front Lotus deals incredible damage, but due to certain unusual circumstances, everyone Lee has used this on has survived. A more complicated version is the Reverse Lotus, which requires the first three gates to be opened. Lee will deliver a bone crushing blow that knocks his opponent into the air, then bounces off his surroundings striking his opponent at near-inhuman speeds, before hitting them back down to the ground. These attacks, are almost impossible to defend against, because of there speed and power, but they are also a double edged sword, that deals severe damage to the user as well.</p><p> </p><p>Lee is a natural master in Drunken Fist, a style that only comes naturally to a person, meaning it can’t be learned or taught. Once Lee consumes even the tiniest bit of alcohol, he becomes an unpredictable fighter, attacking both friend and foe. This mixed with his already incredible taijutsu abilities, makes him an almost impossible opponent to defeat. In this mode, his speed, reflexes greatly increase somehow. Lee has also learned to open the first five of the Eight Gates. These gates are located, on specific points on a person’s chakra system. By flooding these points with chakra, Lee can forcibly release the brain's instinctual restraints on the muscles, allowing him to utilize more from his body than normally possible. By opening the last gate, it is said that even an average person could briefly surpass even a Kage, but the user would inevitably die.</p>",

After a sever injury, following a shoot-out on Mars, Spike would find himself being nursed by the hands of Julia, who was unknowingly the girlfriend of Vicious. Spike and Julia would fall in love, in that small period of time. He planned to leave the syndicate and escape with Julia. However, Vicious found out about the plan. It is unclear, what happened next, but Spike managed to escape the syndicate by faking his death. He waited for Julia, but with by the hands of Vicious, she never showed up. Out of disappointment and heart-break, Spike left Mars and his former life.</p><p>Three years after, the former enforcer would meet an ex-ISSP agent, named <a href=\"/jet-black/4005-57765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57765\">Jet Black</a>. Jet had previously left the force, and became a bounty hunter. After meeting, the two would form a partnership, and Spike would become a bounty hunter, joining Jet on the ex-cop's ship 'Bebop'. They would work together for three years before being joined by other crew members. He and his crew of hunter roam space catching bounties and fighting enemies. However, eventually, his pass catches up to him. He would have a few run-ins with Vicious, again. Finally, he would discover Julia again, finally learning the reason behind her disappearance, on the day that they were suppose to meet up. He learns of Vicious' forcing her to agree to kill Spike. Not being willing to go through with it, she ran. But, she had searched for Spiegel, ever since. Now back together, he planned to escape with her. Unfortunately, the Red Dragons showed up, and ultimately killed her.</p><p>Out of sorrow, he made his way to the headquarters of the the Red Dragons. Here, he would find Vicious, who had eliminated the leads of the syndicate. In this meeting, between the two, they would dual against each other. In this dual, Vicious died immediately after. But, Spike would pass out, due to his sever injuries. While, if is widely believed that he died, It is unknown if he died or not.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Spike is known for his views on his life and himself. He claims that he bares the treat of viewing the present with his prosthetic right eye, and see only the past with his real left eye. He thinks of his false death as a real one, and views himself as a dead man, say that after the day he left his past life, he has \"merely been living a dream\". This through-frame is displayed in his childlike free-spirit, and nonchalant attitude towards dangerous and knowingly fatal odds.</p><p>When he isn't working or training, he is very laid-back and relaxed. A very easy-going person, he typically takes life as it comes. Though, he is somewhat short-tempered at times. Often called 'lunkhead' by his crew mates, his views often come off stubborn.</p><p>Spike's philosophy seems to be based somewhat on the ideals of ancient samurai. Considering oneself as dead, as well as the idea of death being an awaking from a dream, both stem from elements of these ideals.</p><h2>Ability</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4115/331824-78113-spike-spiegel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331824\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4115/331824-78113-spike-spiegel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331824\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4115/331824-78113-spike-spiegel.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4115/331824-78113-spike-spiegel.jpg 400w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4115/331824-78113-spike-spiegel.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>As one of the best bounty hunters throughout space, Spike Spiegel is very skilled and well trained.

He is a depraved tyrant with the powers of a god. He has appeared in almost every Zelda game as the last boss and most imposing enemy. Ganondorf often manipulates events behind the scenes.</p><p> </p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Ganon, otherwise known as Ganondorf, was born to the Gerudo tribe (a race of dark skinned, desert dwelling thieves, who are almost all female, like the Amazons). The Gerudo tribe births one male every 100 years, and that male is destined to be king. Ganondorf started out as a good king, but he couldn't bear the harsh conditions his people had to endure while the Hylians (those native to Hyrule, ex: Zelda, and Link) enjoyed warm summer breezes.</p><p>Ganondorf began to research tomes containing mystical power in hopes of changing his fate, but fell into corruption doing so. Ganondorf wanted more and more power. It was never enough for him. Through this way, he ascertained the location of the goddesses' power, the Triforce. Ganondorf sought to steal the Triforce of Power to take control of Hyrule and the world. Ganondorf succeeded in infiltrating the Sacred Realm and stealing the Triforce, but was only able to steal the Triforce of Power (he did not possess the qualities to wield Wisdom and Courage). But with only the Triforce of Power, Ganondorf attained immortality. godlike powers, and his Ganon form.</p><p> After gaining the Triforce of Power, Ganondorf set in motion his plan to overthrow the Hylian Royal Family and take Hyrule for himself. It was then that he met his eternal rivals; Link the Hero of Time and Princess Zelda for the first time. The hero was powerless to stop Ganondorf at his young age, and the dark king succeeded in his plots.</p><p>Ganondorf's dark reign continued for seven years until the Hero of Time reappeared and defeated him, sealing him in the Sacred Realm and bringing peace to the world.</p><p>Ganondorf has since reincarnated several times and has been defeated by Link everytime. </p><h2>Power from the Triforce</h2><p>Immortality- Ganondorf has been defeated many times only to ressurect himself. It is pretty clear that he cannot be killed, only banished. </p><p>Superhuman Strength- Granted by the Triforce of Power, Ganondorf possesses enhanced strength with an unknown upper limit. In <em>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, </em>he is buried by rubble, but is able to easily break free of it, sending many pieces of debris flying in multiple directions. Many of these pieces are the size of large houses, so it is likely that Ganondorf's strength falls somewhere between the 40-50 ton range. <em> </em></p><p>Sorcery- Ganondorf was already an extremely adept sorceror before he attained the Triforce of Power, which increased his magic immensely. This gave him the ability to do things like create hordes of evil minions from dark magic, summon demons/ghosts, give powers to others, shapeshift, create shadow dopplegangers of himself, and open up portals to other dimensions. </p><p>Invulnerability- Ganondorf can only be harmed by divine weapons of some sort. It should be noted that, in nearly every case, even divine weapons have only been able to stun him or temporarily cause him pain. Link's main weapon, the Master Sword, is the only known thing which can truly kill Ganon. Normal weaponry/force will not defeat him, regardless of its nature. </p><p>Energy Projection- Ganondorf is capable of projecting powerful force-bolts of dark magic, and is also able to project nigh-invulnerable forcefields (he has used this technique more than once to trap and contain others). </p><p>Possession- Ganondorf is able to turn into an intangible spirit form and possess others. </p><p>Flight- Using his magic, Ganondorf is able to achieve flight (the exact speeds at which he can fly is unknown). </p><p>Telepathy- Ganondorf is able to speak to others in their minds without being anywhere near them (he displays this ability to Link in</p><p><em>LoZ: Ocarina</em></p><p><em>of Time</em></p><p>and to his servant, Zant, in</p><p><em>LoZ: Twilight Princess</em></p><p>). </p><p>Swordplay- Ganondorf is an expert swordsman, able to easily keep up with Link when fighting with him. </p><p>Tactics- Ganondorf is a master tactician, able to manipulate emotions, people, and events to achieve his own ends. </p>",
