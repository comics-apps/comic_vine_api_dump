    "deck": "Gandalf is a Maia who were the underlings of the Valar, the Gods of Middle-Earth. He was sent with his fellow Istari Saruman and Radgast to help in Middle Earth from the Undying Lands. He aided Bilbo Baggins and the thirteen dwarfs on their quest to retake Erebor and years later help Frodo as a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Gandalf's true name is Olórin, a wise <a href=\"/maiar/4060-59208/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59208\">Maia</a> spirit from the Undying Lands. He was a pupil of the <a href=\"/valar/4060-59176/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59176\">Valar</a>, Nienna, who taught him pity and patience.</p><p>Olórin was one of five Maiar who were chosen by the Valar to travel to <a href=\"/middle-earth/4020-56636/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56636\">Middle-earth</a> to aid the free-peoples against the return of <a href=\"/sauron/4005-55835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55835\">Sauron</a>. Known as <a href=\"/istari/4060-59207/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59207\">Istari</a>, they were forbidden to dominate the races of Middle-earth through mind or might or to match Sauron's power with power.</p><h2>Middle-earth</h2><p>Upon arriving on Middle-earth at the elven port of Mithlond, the Istari were greeted by Círdan the Shipwright as well as his elf friend Glorfindel. Círdan who said although Olórin was the frailest of the five, he appeared the wisest and to have the most inner strength, because of this Cirdan gave him the gift of Narya, one of the 3 elven rings of power.</p><p>On Middle-earth the Istari became know as Wizards and Olórin himself was know by many different names by different people Mithrandir in Gondor, Stormcrow in Rohan but was most commonly known as Gandalf to Hobbits. For over 1000 years he walked among the Elves teaching them and learning their ways. He is renowned for his fascination in Hobbits.</p><h3>Burglar Baggins and the Return of Sauron</h3><p>Many years later he helped the Hobbit, <a href=\"/bilbo-baggins/4005-67758/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67758\">Bilbo Baggins</a> and 13 Dwarves on a quest to slay the <a href=\"/smaug/4005-9822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9822\">Smaug</a> the Dragon and recover their treasure under the Lonely Mountain. It was during this quest when Bilbo Baggins discovered the dagger, <a href=\"/sting/4055-56347/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56347\">Sting</a>, and the <a href=\"/the-one-ring/4055-56491/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56491\">One Ring</a>, although Gandalf did not realise its true identity at the time, and Gandalf himself discovered the sword, Glamdring.</p><p>During this adventure Gandalf traveled to southern Mirkwood to join the White Council at the Stronghold of Dol Guldur to oust the Necromancer. It was Gandalf himself who discovered that the Necromancer was none other than Sauron.</p><h3>Saruman's Betrayal</h3><p>Some 80 years after the slaying of Smaug, Gandalf had realised the magic ring that Bilbo discovered was none other than the One Ring, a powerful ring that would allow its maker, Sauron, domination over Middle-earth forever. The Ring had long been passed onto Bilbo's nephew, <a href=\"/frodo/4005-62738/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62738\">Frodo</a>. After revealing its true identity to a frightened Frodo he told him to leave the Shire and head east to the elven outpost of Rivendell. Gandalf traveled to Isengard to seek the council of the wizard <a href=\"/saruman/4005-62765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62765\">Saruman</a>.</p><p>After he told him of his discovery of the One Ring, Saruman revealed his true intention of finding the Ring for himself and ruling Middle-earth. When Gandalf refused a battle ensued, however Saruman had the superior powers, and after overpowering him imprisoned him in Isengard, so he couldn't assist the Hobbits, he did however send the ranger Strider to aid them. He was inadvertently rescued from Isengard by his fellow wizard, Radagast the Brown, after he alerted the Eagles of Gandalf's journey there.</p><h3>Council of Elrond</h3><p>Gandalf rejoined Frodo and the One Ring at Rivendell. Thanks to Gandalf's guidance it was decided at the Council of Elrond that the Ring should be taken to Mount Doom, deep in Saurons domain of Mordor, and tossed into the fires. Only there could it be unmade and destroyed forever. A Fellowship was decided upon for this dangerous task, Gandalf, Frodo, <a href=\"/aragorn/4005-62741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62741\">Aragorn</a>, <a href=\"/boromir/4005-68389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68389\">Boromir</a>, <a href=\"/gimli/4005-62763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62763\">Gimli</a> the dwarf, <a href=\"/legolas/4005-62762/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62762\">Legolas</a> the wood elf and the Hobbits <a href=\"/sam/4005-62764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62764\">Sam</a>, <a href=\"/pippin/4005-62761/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62761\">Pippin</a> and <a href=\"/merry/4005-62760/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62760\">Merry</a>.</p><h3>The Passing of Gandalf the Grey</h3><p>During their journey they were forced to travel under the Misty Mountains through the abandoned Dwarven city of Moria. It was here were the <a href=\"/the-fellowship-of-the-ring/4060-56586/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56586\">Fellowship</a> caught the attention of a <a href=\"/the-balrog/4005-62766/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62766\">Balrog</a>, an ancient, powerful and dreadful creature from many ages past. Gandalf realized after entering Moria that it housed a dreaded Balrog, a creature which is also a Maia. Due to his knowledge of its power Gandalf realized he must stop and to defeat the fire-demon. As he smashed the bridge on which the Balrog stood with his staff.</p><p>However the Balrog's immense fiery whip grabbed him while the beast fell and pulled him down. The fellowship all believed he died from the fall, however Gandalf and the Balrog fought long in the bowels and deep places of Arda. Gandalf finally pursued the beast up the Endless Stair to the peak of Celebidil, where he fought the Balrog for two days and nights, atop Zirak-Zigil where he finally slew the beast and perished himself from exhaustion.</p><h3>The Return of Gandalf the White</h3><p>Despite the death of his body his Maia spirit could not perish. He was \"sent back\" by Eru because his task on Middle-earth was yet unfinished. More powerful than before he was now Gandalf the White to signify his new standing as leader of the White Council. Upon returning he called for a horse, and his call was answered by Shadowfax the Lord of all Horses, much to the distaste of Theoden, and his limitless endurance was soon put to use. He received his white robes from Galadriel in Lórien.</p><p>Gandalf the White's first task was to rally the Horse-lords of Rohan. With Isengard on their doorstep he knew that Sarumans armies would soon strike at the heart of Man. Upon arriving at Rohan, Gandalf discovers that King Theoden is under the spell and control of Saruman's agent, Grima Wormtongue. Breaking the spell, Gandalf convinces Theoden to take up arms against Isengard with all the men he can muster.</p><p>While Theoden and the Rohirrim ride to Helms Deep, Gandalf travels to meet with Treebeard to convince him that he is in need of the Huorns to defeat Saruman's army.</p><h2>Power and Abilities</h2><p><b>Energy Manipulation</b> Gandalf has the ability to project vast amounts of energy in the form of a natural element, such as wind and lightning and water or more commonly fire (which is augmented by his possesion of Narya). Having had eons of practice he is deadly accurate with his projection and can deal large amounts of damage with them.</p><p><b>Energy Absorption</b> Gandalf has displayed the ability to absorb both magical attacks from fellow Maia (e.g. Balrog and Saruman) and standard attacks (e.g. flames or waves) as well.</p><p><b>Weapon Master</b> Gandalf has displayed proficiency in both his handling of his sword: Glamdring, and his staff. He survived the entire time he was in middle earth relatively unscathed and even defeated a Balrog single-handedly.</p><h2>Gandalf on Film</h2><p>Gandalf's first outing on screen was in the 1977 animated film, The Hobbit, where he was voiced by John Huston. The character soon appeared again the next year in Ralph Bakshi's <a href=\"/the-lord-of-the-rings/4025-798/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-798\">The Lord of the Rings</a>, this time voiced by William Squire. In 1980 John Huston reprized his role in <a href=\"/the-return-of-the-king/4025-803/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-803\">The Return of the King</a>, to complete the 'unofficial' trilogy of animated films.</p><p>In Peter Jackson's <a href=\"/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring/4025-321/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-321\">The Lord of the Ring trilogy</a>, Gandalf is portrayed by the British actor Sir Ian McKellen who appeared in all 3 films.</p>",

These were tall, proud men most famous are the ancestors of Aragorn: Elendil the Tall and Isildur.</p><p>Aragorn's father was called Arathorn, however was not King of Gondor, because that line had been lost prior to his time.</p><p>His father was killed by a group of mountain trolls while on a hunt. Throughout his youth he had strong ties with Rivendell, because his father was a friend of Elrond, and also because both of Elrond's sons Elrohir and Elodir were <a href=\"/rangers/4060-59180/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59180\">Rangers</a> of the North alongside Aragorn. Furthermore, it was during his youth and large amount of time spent training here that his relationship with <a href=\"/arwen/4005-9272/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9272\">Arwen</a> was started.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The character Aragorn and all characters that appear in Middle Earth are created by <a href=\"/j-r-r-tolkien/4040-61335/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-61335\">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> and were adapted to comics by Luis Berjmo and Toutain Editor, and to several films by a host of different directors.</p><h2>Pre Fellowship</h2><p>Aragorn was a ranger of the North and a mysterious figure for many years. He protected the local people of the land from evil. He was trained by Elves and men both, inheriting the strengths of both peoples.</p><p>He is well skilled in swordsmanship, hunting, stealth, field medicine, and tracking skills. Aragorn meet <a href=\"/frodo/4005-62738/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62738\">Frodo</a> at the Prancing Pony and led him and his hobbit friends to Rivendell. He agreed to protect Frodo with his life, which he proved valiantly in the Mines of Moria.</p><p>After <a href=\"/gandalf/4005-62740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62740\">Gandalf</a> apparently died fighting the <a href=\"/the-balrog/4005-62766/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62766\">Balrog</a> , Aragorn led the Company. Aragorn fought at Amon Hen with his friends, afterwards he accepted his role as future king of Gondor, after swearing to do so to the dying gondorian Captain <a href=\"/boromir/4005-68389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68389\">Boromir</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arc</h2><p>When they realized <a href=\"/pippin/4005-62761/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62761\">Pippin</a> and <a href=\"/merry/4005-62760/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62760\">Merry</a> were captured and Frodo and <a href=\"/sam/4005-62764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62764\">Sam</a> had left for Mordor they decided to find the captured hobbits. Aragorn tracked down the location of the two hobbits which led to Fangorn Forest and he found Gandalf ,who helped them get to Edoras where they met with King Theoden and were informed of the predicament that Rohan was in.</p><p>He fought to defend the caravan of travelers who were destined for Helm's deep from ferocious Warg Riders sent by <a href=\"/saruman/4005-62765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62765\">Saruman</a>, however he fell off a cliff and was believed to have died. A few hours later he appeared at Helm's Deep armed and well. He was instrumental in holding the front line of defense, particularly after the breach of the wall.</p><p>Following this battle and the departure of Gandalf for Minas Tirith we do not hear much from Aragorn until we see that he was the first to realize that The Beacons of Gondor had been lit. He joined the army of Rohirrim 6,000 strong that Theoden assembled to aid the Gondorians.</p><p>Upon arriving in Gondor, the Rohirrim rested near Dunharrow. It was here that Elrond came bearing the sword Narsil, renamed Anduril (meaning flame of the west) so that Aragorn could confront the army of the dead. While the rest of the Rohirrim rode on Aragorn, <a href=\"/legolas/4005-62762/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62762\">Legolas</a> and <a href=\"/gimli/4005-62763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62763\">Gimli</a> ventured into the Path of the Dead and Aragorn swore that should the Ghosts aid The Gondorians in defending Minas Tirith they could pass into the void.</p><p>Aragorn along with his newly found army overran the Corsairs-pirates who were on their way to fell Minas Tirith-and turned the tide of the war. After the battle he fulfilled the oath he made to the ghosts and visited the Houses of Healing where he demonstrated that the hands of the king are indeed the hands of a healer.</p><p>He bravely led a small army to the Black Gate in the battle of Mormonan to distract <a href=\"/sauron/4005-55835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55835\">Sauron</a> and allow the ring-bearer to complete his task.</p><h2>Post Fellowship</h2><p>After this came both the marriage and coronation of Aragorn.

When the first Death Egg was launched, Silver Sonic was assigned to be the station's primary protector.</p><p>When Sonic and Tails, who had stowed away aboard the Death Egg in an effort to destroy it from the inside, tried to escape as the vessel they found themselves cornered by the hulking Silver Sonic.</p><p>Unlike Sonic, however, Silver Sonic was not designed for speed and could not move as fast as its counterpart but what it lacked in speed it made up for in raw strength. The two did battle, which ultimately ended with Sonic managing to short circuit Silver Sonic using a broken power cable before the titanic doppelganger could crush him beneath its boot.</p><p>Sonic then used Silver Sonic's body as armor to combat Robotnik, who had donned a suit that enhanced his powers thanks to its direct connection to the Death Egg's power core. Later, just before the Death Egg exploded, Sonic grabbed Tails and a few power rings and leaped off of the station, upon landing Sonic discarded the remains of Silver Sonic which were never recovered by Robotnik or anyone for that matter.</p><p><strong>Silver Sonic MK II</strong></p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1903618\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1903618-egg_of_death021.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.69624060150376\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1903618-egg_of_death021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1903618\"><img alt=\"Silver Sonic MK II\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1903618-egg_of_death021.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1903618-egg_of_death021.jpg 665w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1903618-egg_of_death021.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1903618-egg_of_death021.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Silver Sonic MK II</figcaption></figure><p>The second Silver Sonic was constructed by Doctor Eggman and, as part of a revenge scheme for ruining his plans involving Perfect Chaos, was unleashed upon Station Square during a farewell celebration for Sonic and his friends.</p><p>Unlike it's giant and clunky predecessor, the new Silver Sonic was sleek, better equipped and faster than a speeding bullet. It had also been given a personality that mimicked Sonic's own.</p><p>After firing a pair of guided missiles on Sonic, Silver Sonic engaged the Freedom Fighters in combat until Sonic was able to enter the fray and plow the war machine into a large building complex with an appliance store on the ground floor. Using one of its metallic whips, the insane robot ripped the main support column apart and brought the entire building down on top of them both.</p><p>Silver Sonic emerged from the rubble, believing his counterpart to be dead, and went on a rampage through Station Square completely unaware that Sonic had actually burrowed underground before the building could crush him. Silver Sonic was surprised to learn Sonic was still alive when the blue hedgehog emerged from a manhole and grabbed onto him.</p><p>As Silver Sonic flew across the city with his organic counterpart in tow, he activated his built in mini-laser cannon and tried blowing off Sonic's head, but Sonic was able to leap off of Silver Sonic fast enough that the robot ended up blasting his own foot off. When said foot knocked Tails, who had saved Sonic from a lethal fall, unconscious Sonic's anger grew and he spin-dashed into Silver Sonic and ripped his head off.</p><p>When Eggman went looking for Silver Sonic in Station Square, he found that his robot had been repaired and reprogrammed to serve as Station Square's new G.U.N. approved protector. Silver Sonic pursued Eggman, who was forced to run on foot thanks to the destruction of his Egg Carrier, all the way into the forests beyond Station Square's borders but stopped when Eggman fell into a pit and could no longer be detected by his former creation.</p><p>Weeks later, when the newly reawakened Shadow the Hedgehog broke into a bank vault and stole the Chaos Emerald within, he was confronted by Silver Sonic who immediately engaged him in battle. However, Shadow proved to be too powerful and damaged Silver Sonic beyond G.U.N.'s ability to repair.</p><p><strong>Silver Sonic MK III</strong></p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1903604\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2960687960688\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1903604\"><img alt=\"Silver Sonic MK III\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg 814w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg 493w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Silver Sonic MK III\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg 814w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1903604-egg_of_death014.jpg 493w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Silver Sonic MK III</figcaption></figure><p>Like the original, the third Silver Sonic was a titanic juggernaut whose primary function was to defend the Death Egg MK II from intruders. Unlike the original, the MK III was a perfect blend of the previous units, combining the size and power of the original with the speed and maneuverability the second possessed.</p><p>It made its presence known when Sally and Sonic infiltrated the Death Egg in search of Eggman by tearing its way out of a tiny elevator shaft. While the sight of it horrified Sally, Sonic was more than excited to combat the newest model of his rarely seen doppelganger.</p><p>While the two hedgehogs engaged each other in an all-out brawl, Sally decided to proceed further into the Death Egg only to be blasted to pieces by a hidden Sentry Gun. When Sonic heard the Sentry Gun fire, he turned away from his gigantic counterpart and began running to the source of the gunshots.</p><p>Silver Sonic managed to strike Sonic before the Genesis Wave enveloped the world and temporarily erased him from existence. When everything returned to normal, time had rewound back ten seconds before Sally was struck down by the Sentry Gun. Sonic immediately disengaged his fight with Silver Sonic and saved Sally.</p><p>Silver Sonic, who had been in hot pursuit of his counterpart, ended up being blown apart by the Sentry Gun instead of the young princess. Later, during Sonic's battle with the latest Metal Sonic, a heavily damaged but still functioning Silver Sonic entered the fray and helped its \"little brother\" in the fight against their most hated enemy.</p><p>However, when Sally managed to invert the World Roboticizer beam to her position beneath it, Silver Sonic and Metal Sonic were exposed to the roboticization process and exploded taking the World Roboticizer and a huge portion of the Death Egg with them. Silver Sonic's remains were dumped out of the Death Egg when Eggman had Mecha Sally toss Sonic off the Death Egg.</p><p><strong>Silver Sonic v3.1</strong></p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3040352\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/3040352-silver+sonic001.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.3632183908046\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/3040352-silver+sonic001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3040352\"><img alt=\"Silver Sonic v3.1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px\" data-width=\"469\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/3040352-silver+sonic001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/3040352-silver+sonic001.jpg 435w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Silver Sonic v3.1\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/3040352-silver+sonic001.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/3040352-silver+sonic001.jpg 435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px\" data-width=\"469\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Silver Sonic v3.1</figcaption></figure><p>This Silver Sonic was simply another MK III model who was dispatched along with Mecha Sally and an army of EggSwats to a village in Feral Forest in an attempt to assassinate Sally's brother, Elias.</p><p>When Sonic attempted to confront Mecha Sally, she brushed him off and ordered Silver Sonic to attack, who erupted forth from a nearby hut and immediately engaged Sonic in battle.</p><p>While Mecha Sally headed off to finish their mission objective, Silver Sonic tore the village asunder as it tried to kill Sonic, not even caring that it had destroyed a large group of EggSwats and freed several prisoners from their grasp.</p><p>But just as Sonic prepared to fight Silver Sonic in earnest, T-Pup came between the two of them and shocked Silver Sonic into stasis mode which allowed the villagers enough time to tie it down and destroy it.</p><p>Silver Sonic was later stripped down and its parts along with those of the fallen EggSwats were used to rebuild the village.</p>",

When confronted by a crowd of punks in a disco, the criminal pair used their powers indiscriminately to burn the building down and kill everyone inside. Later however, they encountered the mad prophet,<a href=\"/jer-em/4005-85123/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85123\"> Jer-Em</a>, who intended to send himself to the Kryptonian afterlife by exposing himself to a large chunk of deadly Green <a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite</a>. Before they could flee, Jer-Em grabbed Nadira and pulled her onto the Kryptonite, exposing her to a fatal dose of radiation. Az-Rel fled, but was soon caught by Superman who had Az-Rel take him to Nadira in order to help her. In her dying pain, Nadira used her psychokinetic powers to trigger Az-Rel's pyrotic abilities, forcing him to immolate himself for abandoning her.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities 1998</h2><figure style=\"width: 349px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3906238\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3906238-az-rel-phantom_zone%231-pyrotic.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.87106017191977\" data-width=\"349\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3906238-az-rel-phantom_zone%231-pyrotic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3906238\"><img alt=\"Pre-Crisis Az-Rel's pyrotic abilities.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3906238-az-rel-phantom_zone%231-pyrotic.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3906238-az-rel-phantom_zone%231-pyrotic.jpg 349w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3906238-az-rel-phantom_zone%231-pyrotic.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Pre-Crisis Az-Rel's pyrotic abilities.\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3906238-az-rel-phantom_zone%231-pyrotic.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3906238-az-rel-phantom_zone%231-pyrotic.jpg 349w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3906238-az-rel-phantom_zone%231-pyrotic.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Pre-Crisis Az-Rel's pyrotic abilities.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Prior to Infinite Crisis, Az-Rel was a \"pyrotic,\" and capable of setting things on fire with but a thought.

As a death God she commands a certain amount of dread and freight that few other Indian gods do.  <br/> <br/>She has been a sworn enemy of Skanda for ages and the two hate each other passionately.  <br/> <br/>In modern times she and  Dr.Doom's daughter entered into an undisclosed contract and after allowing the girl free reign in India she promptly took possession of<a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" slug=\"doctor-doom\">     Dr.Doom</a>'s daughter and later did battle with the mutant superhero team <a data-ref-id=\"4060-54861\" href=\"/genext/4060-54861/\" slug=\"genext\">   GeNext</a>.  <br/> <br/>However as fate would have it she was defeated but unknown to her opponents she still resides within Sophie. She swears revenge on Genext for her defeat.<br/> <br/><h3>Powers  </h3><br/>She has superhuman strength, speed, endurance, intelligence and senses. She also draws power from the dead and dyig as the goddess of death. She can also comandeer the bodies of anyone whether through possession or by way of magic. As a goddess she also has vast reserves of magical energy with which to cast any number of spells.  <br/> <br/>She also has a certain degree of control over the souls of mortals, able to pull souls from bodies and even \"reincartane\" whomever she wills.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><br/>",

    "deck": "Winky, Blinky and Nod were three inept enemies of the Flash/Jay Garrick introduced in 1942. They were small time criminals but were convinced to reform. They went on to become among the Flash's regular supporting cast and to be featured in a series of their own in \"All-Flash Comics\". ",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Winky, Blinky and Noddy were a trio of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56949\" href=\"/three-stooges/4060-56949/\" slug=\"three-stooges\">Three Stooges</a> look-alikes who served as comic relief for the Golden-Age <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2395\" href=\"/jay-garrick/4005-2395/\" slug=\"jay-garrick\">Flash</a> . Variously referred to as the “<b>Three Numbskulls</b>,” “<b>Three Idiots</b>,” “<b>Three Dopes</b>,” or, most often, the “<b>Three Dimwits</b>,” they were friends of the Flash, Jay Garrick, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9312\" href=\"/joan-garrick/4005-9312/\" slug=\"joan-garrick\">Joan Williams</a> .</p><p>The trio would get into trouble on their own, or get mixed up in trouble that was already brewing, and would invariably drag the Flash into it one way or another. They even graduated to their own regular feature in <i>All-American Comics</i>.</p><p>Winky was the big one with curly brown hair, Blinky the skinny redhead whose eyes were always hidden, and Noddy the short one with a fringe of black hair and a big hat. They started out as small-time criminals working for stable owner Walter King, but they weren’t terribly good at it. After an encounter with the Flash that led to King’s arrest, they moved to more benign pursuits.</p><p>They passed through occupations ranging from bellhops and floor-sweepers to restaurateurs, investors—and even inventors! For a while they were famous as “Professors of Personality” (having invented a “personality ray” ). Blinky even had a brief stint as the super-hero Muscleman.</p><p>At least twice, the trio was mistaken for similar-looking villains. Once during World War II, several Axis agents mistook them for their unseen superiors, the Terrible Three. Not long afterward, they were mistaken for a trio of conquerors from the planet Karma .</p><h3>Retirement</h3><p>The Dimwits disappeared with the Golden Age, appearing just three times in the years since. Once, with no explanation, in a Silver-Age <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\" href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" slug=\"barry-allen\">Flash</a> story. Once in a flashback to explain why they disappeared: While riding the rails out west, they stumbled upon a sack full of money, and decided to retire to the Caribbean. Finally, it was shown that in modern times they had become security guards at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-50067\" href=\"/flash-museum/4020-50067/\" slug=\"flash-museum\">Flash Museum</a> , where an attacker killed them.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History<br/></h2>Pre-teen Tommy Rodgers decided to wear a costume and fight crime as Little Boy Blue when he overheard his father, District Attorney Dan Rogers, talking about how hard it would be to bring in a mobster named Wolf Lupo, with the star witness missing. He got the idea from reading about <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7645\" href=\"/wildcat/4005-7645/\" slug=\"wildcat\">      Wildcat</a>, who was starting his superhero career who got his idea from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12663\" href=\"/alan-scott/4005-12663/\" slug=\"alan-scott\">     Green Lantern</a>. He became the first third-generation superhero. Being a kid, Tommy was in the unusual position of being able to have a kid sidekick his own age. In fact, he had two. On his way to Lupo's lair, he picked up his friend, Tubby; and once there, a third, a wrong-side-of-the-tracks type named Toughy, joined in. After rescuing the witness (whom Lupo was holding prisoner), they decided to continue superheroing as <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55778\" href=\"/little-boy-blue-and-the-blue-boys/4060-55778/\" slug=\"little-boy-blue-and-the-blue-boys\">    Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys</a>. They wore similar blue costumes, except for Tommy's red hood and boots. Some point later, he and his Blue Boys acquired a female teammate who called herself <a data-ref-id=\"4005-69837\" href=\"/little-miss-redhead/4005-69837/\" slug=\"little-miss-redhead\">Little Miss Redhead</a>.<br/><h2>Legacy<br/></h2>Years later Tommy retires from superheroing, gets married and has a child of his own. His son finds his father's old costume, along with a diary to explain their significance. He got together with Tubby and Toughy's sons when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3583\" href=\"/dr-light/4005-3583/\" slug=\"dr-light\"> Dr. Light</a> looks for ever-less formidable foes to challenge (only to continue being a loser and a joke). Dr. Light was defeated by the new Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys.",

Her planet is technologically advanced due to the two main civilizations. 400 years before Starfire, the priests summoned the bulky Mygorg, to serve as soldiers in their war. The enemy priests summoned the Mygorg's enemies, the shadowy Yorg. When both of the summoned races realized they were stronger than their human masters, they rebelled and enslaved them. Sookarath was the Mygorg chieftain. When a baby was brought to him, whose mother had white skin and her father had yellow skin. He raised the child as a slave.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Starfire was created by <a href=\"/david-michelinie/4040-40650/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40650\">David Michelinie</a> and <a href=\"/mike-vosburg/4040-5595/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5595\">Mike Vosburg</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/833871-starfire3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-833871\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.304347826087\" data-width=\"184\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 184px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:230.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/833871-starfire3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-833871\"><img alt=\"Starfire\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/833871-starfire3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/833871-starfire3.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px\" data-width=\"184\"></a><figcaption>Starfire</figcaption></figure><p>When she became 18, she was to become his betrothed.

Her most difficult lesson was that of independence. She fell in love with Dagan, until he was captured, tortured and killed by Sookarath's orders.

She began to slowly develop a rebel army that accompanied her on raids against Mygorg strongholds. Her first recruit was an aging priest named Anzus. Shortly thereafter, she aided in rescuing an addle-brained mute from a Mygorg pit-fighting arena. Bestowing upon him the uncomplimentary name of Thump, she came to regard him as one of her most loyal followers. The Mygorg sent a slave-scout named Moonwatcher to find Starfire for them. Moonwatcher succeeded in fulfilling his masters' wishes, but quickly turned on his oppressors and joined Starfire’s cause. Starfire eventually found and slew Sookaroth, but he was one of many Mygorg who would soon fall before her blade.</p><h4>Lady Djinn</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1921487-lady_djinn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1921487\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3088235294118\" data-width=\"272\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1921487-lady_djinn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1921487\"><img alt=\"The evil sorceress Lady Djinn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\" data-width=\"272\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1921487-lady_djinn.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1921487-lady_djinn.jpg 272w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The evil sorceress Lady Djinn\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1921487-lady_djinn.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1921487-lady_djinn.jpg 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\" data-width=\"272\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The evil sorceress Lady Djinn</figcaption></figure><p>Through the course of their crusade, Starfire learned about the Lightning Lords, an extinct society that once ruled her home world before the arrival of the Mygorg. She acquired a map that led to an ancient Lightning Lord Citadel, only to discover that it was now occupied by an evil sorceress named Lady Djinn. Lady Djinn had allied herself with the alien Yorg – a rival faction to the Mygorg.The enemy forces captured Thump and brought him back to the Citadel. Starfire and her crew mounted a rescue expedition and broke inside the Citadel. They discovered a master computer system known as the Keeper – an artificial intelligence capable of wielding massive amounts of power. The Keeper system had been misused by Lady Djinn and now sought to betray her. It aided Starfire and helped her crew to escape Lady Djinn's clutches, before ultimately destroying her. Following the downfall of Lady Djinn, Starfire and her rebels embarked upon a quest to find an ancient Lightning Lord artifact known as the Eye of Armageddon. The details surrounding this difficult mission have yet to be chronicled.</p><h4>Starfire Teams-up with DC Super-Heroes</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68486/1356210-bg_ten_seconds.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1356210\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5657439446367\" data-width=\"578\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 578px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68486/1356210-bg_ten_seconds.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1356210\"><img alt=\"Starfire meets Booster Gold\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68486/1356210-bg_ten_seconds.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68486/1356210-bg_ten_seconds.jpg 578w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68486/1356210-bg_ten_seconds.jpg 408w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Starfire meets Booster Gold\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68486/1356210-bg_ten_seconds.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68486/1356210-bg_ten_seconds.jpg 578w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68486/1356210-bg_ten_seconds.jpg 408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Starfire meets Booster Gold</figcaption></figure><p>Sometime later, Starfire had found herself briefly imprisoned by a Jovian warlord known as Jarrko for a brief period of time.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Pippin lived in the Shire like most hobbits until Frodo was given the quest to destroy the One Ring. Pippin and his best friend Merry decided to come with him. He traveled with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62738\" href=\"/frodo/4005-62738/\">Frodo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62764\" href=\"/sam/4005-62764/\">Sam</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62760\" href=\"/merry/4005-62760/\">Merry</a> on the way to Rivendell where they met Tom Bombadil and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62741\" href=\"/aragorn/4005-62741/\">Aragorn</a>. During a meeting regarding what would happen to the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56491\" href=\"/the-one-ring/4055-56491/\">One Ring</a>, Pippin became a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56586\" href=\"/the-fellowship-of-the-ring/4060-56586/\">Fellowship of the Ring</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Like all Lord of the Rings characters, Pippin was created by J.R.R. Tolkien originally as stories for his son Christopher which later became books and were later adapted into films and graphic novels.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>He traveled with the Fellowship of the Ring through the Mines of Moria but was kidnapped by Urak Hai along with Merry after they left. The Uruk Hai carried the two hobbits until they reached the edge of Fangorn forest where the Uruk Hai were attacked by Eomer and the Rohan warriors and Pippin and Merry took the opportunity to escape. In Fangorn forest they met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9821\" href=\"/treebeard/4005-9821/\">Treebeard</a> and joined the ents in the attack on Isengard. During the attack Grima Wormtongue used the Palantir as a missile which Pippin subsequently picked up. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62740\" href=\"/gandalf/4005-62740/\">Gandalf</a> noticed and took it back but a short time later, when staying in Rohan, Pippin took the Palantir from Gandalf's hands as he slept.</p><p>Because of Pippin's use of the Palantir, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55835\" href=\"/sauron/4005-55835/\">Sauron</a> was aware of his presence causing Gandalf to decide to bring Pippin with him to Gondor. Here, Pippin met Denethor, father of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-68389\" href=\"/boromir/4005-68389/\">Boromir</a> and took responsibility for Boromir's death as he had died protecting Pippin. Pippin joined the Gondorian knights and served Denethor personally. He later saved <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2719\" href=\"/faramir/4005-2719/\">Faramir</a> from being cremated when Denethor thought him already dead.</p><p>To buy Frodo and Sam more time to destroy the Ring, armies gathered at the Black Gate for a final battle, Pippin amongst them.</p><p>After the destruction of the Ring, the four hobbits returned to the Shire only to find it taken over by Saruman. The hobbits, using their new fighting experience, were able to finally eradicate Saruman.</p>",

    "deck": "Legolas is the elf prince of Mirkwood son of King Thranduil, and the only elven member of the Fellowship Of The Ring",
    "description": "<h2>Background</h2><p>Legolas was a Sindarin Elf of the Greenwood (later Mirkwood) who became a part of the <a href=\"/the-fellowship-of-the-ring/4060-56586/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56586\">Fellowship of the Ring</a>. Legolas, son of the King Thranduil of Mirkwood is a Prince of the Woodland Realm, and also a messenger, and a master Bowman.</p><p>With his keen eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent bowmanship, Legolas was a valuable resource to the other eight of the Fellowship. His age is never stated by Tolkien but is estimated by some to be between 500 and 3000 years old.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Legolas' character undergoes a series of changes that were the most explicit of all the characters in the fellowship.</p><p>Upon being informed of the secret council of <a href=\"/elrond/4005-86209/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86209\">Elrond</a> meeting at <a href=\"/rivendell/4020-57962/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57962\">Rivendell</a>, Legolas had only lived in mirkwood with the elves, in complete isolation from the other races of Middle Earth, and all that he knew of dwarves and men were stories of old. Of how all the men were weak and easily corrupted. And of how the dwarves were jealous and greedy.</p><p>And so it was natural, that when he arrived at the council he was very unwilling to allow the men and dwarves and hobbits undergo this task without his presence. He was very proud and aloof. Greeting all the others save <a href=\"/gandalf/4005-62740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62740\">Gandalf</a> (for he knew his true identity) with a condescending tone and treating them as though they were children. Having lived for several millenia already his compatriots were very young in comparison.</p><p>After having spent longer with the fellowship he grew less wary of the others and began to converse with them. Following a few skirmishes with orcs he began to trust the others, as they had saved him many times throughout these battles. In particular his friendship with one <a href=\"/gimli/4005-62763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62763\">Gimli</a> son of Gloin the dwarf is particularly noteworthy.</p><p>This warriors' bond soon developed into a brotherly relationship were the two became rather inseparable. Throughout all the battles Legolas shed his previous vanity and arrogance and embraced the battle with mirth and pleasure alongside his friend, always competing for who could slay the most orcs. His relationship with <a href=\"/aragorn/4005-62741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62741\">Aragorn</a> also bloomed from mutual respect to the best of friends and they became stout allies, despite the unorthodox relationship.</p><p>Legolas was the first elf in a long time to forsake his beloved wood and meet and travel and battle with dwarves and men and he was the first elf to take a dwarf to the Undying Lands. He matured far in more in the few years during the War Of The Ring than in the millenia in Mirkwood, changing from a proud arrogant and self-centred being into a compassionate responsible and insightful elf.</p><h2>Before The Fellowship</h2><p>Very little is known of the exploits of Legolas before his arrival at Rivendell save that he often took his elves to Ithilien in Gondor. During this time relationships prospered as did the race of wood elves. His time in mirkwood is often unaccounted save time spent in his father's court.</p><h2>During The Fellowship</h2><p>Legolas was a vital part of the fellowship and had a wide skill set which was used throughout the quest. His most famous ability is his bowmanship, which is first demonstrated where he shoots multiple arrows at the Cave Troll, and seemingly never misses. His agility and lithe speed and tracking ability is essential following the loss of <a href=\"/merry/4005-62760/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62760\">Merry</a> and <a href=\"/pippin/4005-62761/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62761\">Pippin</a>.</p><p>He develops a very strong friendship with Gimli throughout their travels and engages in competitions to see who can kill the most orcs at every oppurtunity. His most impressive feat is single-handedly taking down a Mumakil and killing all its riders.</p><h2>After The Fellowship</h2><p>Following the destruction of the <a href=\"/the-one-ring/4055-56491/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56491\">One Ring</a>, Legolas attended the coronation and wedding of his good friend <a href=\"/aragorn/4005-62741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62741\">Aragorn</a>, or as he is now known King Elessar. He accompanied <a href=\"/gimli/4005-62763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62763\">Gimli</a> on a tour through the most wondrous of the dwarven mines and then provided Gimli with a tour of Mirkwood. Sortly after he replaced his father as King of Mirkwood, however after a short time departed with Gimli on an elven ship to the Undying Lands.</p><p><i>\"Legolas Greenleaf, long under tree,</i> <i>In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea!</i> <i>If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,</i> <i>Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.\"</i> <i>Galadriel's message to Legolas (The Two Towers, Chapter 5)</i></p><h2>Character and Personality</h2><p>Although he lived among them and in their culture, Legolas was not one of the Silvan Elves. As a son of the Elven-king Thranduil, who had originally come from Doriath, Legolas was actually a Sindarin Elf. This is complicated by the fact that a small minority of Sindarin Elves ruled the predominantly Silvan Woodland Realm of Northern Mirkwood, a minority to which Legolas belonged.</p><p>The Sindarin minority in that realm, who should have been more nobler and wiser than the Silvan Elves, can be seen as having \"gone native\" at the end of the First Age: after Melkor was defeated and all of the grand Elf-kingdoms of Beleriand were destroyed, they can be seen as going back to \"a simpler time\" in their culture.</p><p>Like all elves, Legolas has a great respect and appreciation for nature. While in <a href=\"/fangorn-forest/4020-57923/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57923\">Fangorn Forest</a> he longed to return once more in order to explore its wonders more thoroughly. He is kind, and cares greatly for his friends, even Gimli the Dwarf, which was a rarity for Elves and Dwarves to express a liking for one another. Due to his age however, he is somewhat egotistical and thinks of those around him, adults in technicality, as children (all except for <a href=\"/gandalf/4005-62740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62740\">Gandalf</a> ).</p><p>In the Extended version of <a href=\"/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king/4025-323/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-323\">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a>, Legolas is shown to hold his liquor very well. Eomer challenged Legolas and Gimli to a drinking game, to which he won, when Gimli fainted and collapsed after drinking too much ale.</p><h2>Legolas' name</h2><p>The name <b>Legolas</b> is a Silvan dialect form of pure Sindarin <i>Laegolas</i>, Greenleaf. It consists of the Sindarin words<i>laeg</i>, green; and <i>golas</i>, a collection of leaves, foliage (being a prefixed collective form of <i>las(s)</i>, leaf).</p><p>The Quenya form (mentioned in the <i>Book of Lost Tales</i> in the context of another character of that name) is <i>Laiqualassë</i>. It may be that Thranduil named his son <i>Legolas</i> to at least in part refer to this people, who were remote kin and ancestors of the later Silvan Elves, the people Thranduil ruled and to whom - very likely - Thranduil's wife belonged.</p><h2> </h2><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As one of the Sindarin Elves, Legolas is exceptionally skilled and powerful. He adopted a bow that was given to him by Galadriel and makes deadly use of it. This bow had a draw weight of about 150 pounds and Legolas was able to repeatedly draw and fire arrows from this bow, quickly and continuously, without tiring. This indicates that he has a lifting capacity of at least 1300lbs. Legolas’ agility and reflexes are also among the best of the elves, making prodigious leaps with ease, accomplishing difficult acrobatic movements and moving at meta-human speed while fighting and sprinting. Legolas sees at a distance of roughly six times that of a keenly sighted human (like Aragorn). He has exceptional night-vision, hearing, and even an enhanced sense of smell. He can sense mystical presences, both evil and benign, and is well-versed in various forms of Elven magic. When in a natural environment, Legolas can move undetected and unhindered and at his top speed (in the book \"Fellowship of the Ring,\" Legolas stood up and sprinted across the top of the drifts of snow without sinking).</p><p>Legolas is deftly skilled in hand to hand combat, melee weapon combat (knives and swords), and is a peerless archer. He can send an arrow with deadly force over great distance with pinpoint accuracy, and has mastered the art of the quick-draw shot.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Elven bow and long knife</h3><p>Legolas carries two weapons with him on his journey with the Fellowship. He sports a slender bow of Mirkwood which he aims with deadly precision. He prefers to pierce his enemies from afar, but he also carries \"at his belt a long white knife\" (<u>The Fellowship of the Ring</u>, p314). In Lothlorien he was given a bow of the Galadhrim, stouter than those of the fashion of Mirkwood.</p><p>Nevertheless he adopts his new bow and makes deadly use of it in the remainder of the War of the Ring. This bow had a draw weight of about 150 pounds. It could reputedly send an arrow with deadly force for over 400 yards. The bow was over six feet tall, and was made from a single piece of Mallorn heartwood. Its string had a single strand of Galadriel's hair entwined with it to help speed the arrow along even faster. Legolas' skill with the bow is revered.</p><p>In the movie adaptation he wields a Rohirric sword at the Battle of Helm's Deep, presumably because his daggers would not be very effective from horseback. He also carries two knives across his back, instead of a single knife in his belt.</p><h2>Films</h2><p>He appears in all three of Peter Jackson's Trilogy and is portrayed by Orlando Bloom.</p>",

He inherited the position of gardener at Bag End from his father.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Sam was originally created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-61335\" href=\"/j-r-r-tolkien/4040-61335/\">J.R.R. Tolkien</a> for his book series <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, making his first appearance in the first book in that series, <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>. He made his first appearance in comics in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-21718\" href=\"/lord-of-the-rings/4050-21718/\"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></a> #1.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Fellowship of the Rings</h3><p>Sam is the gardener at Bag End, and friends with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62738\" href=\"/frodo/4005-62738/\">Frodo Baggins</a>. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62740\" href=\"/gandalf/4005-62740/\">Gandalf</a> arrives in the Shire bringing news of the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56491\" href=\"/the-one-ring/4055-56491/\">One Ring</a>, which Frodo had unknowingly had in his possession, Sam eavesdrops on their conversation. He is caught eavesdropping, and Gandalf sends him to be a companion to Frodo on the trip to Rivendell. Sam dutifully aids Frodo on his journey to Rivendell, and there becomes one of the nine members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56586\" href=\"/the-fellowship-of-the-ring/4060-56586/\">Fellowship of the Ring</a>. The Fellowship travels together for sometime until they are broken at the Falls of Rauros. There, Sam is the only member of the Fellowship to accompany Frodo onwards.</p><h3>The Two Towers</h3><p>As they travel towards Mordor, Sam and Frodo are stalked by the creature known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62873\" href=\"/gollum/4005-62873/\">Gollum</a>. Sam is able to capture him and, despite his deep mistrust of the creature, allows Gollum to guide him and Frodo to Mordor at Frodo's insistence. During their journey, Frodo grows increasingly weak due to the malevolent influence of the Ring. As such, Sam bears most of the burdens of the journey, carrying most of their possessions, guarding their camp and cooking their food. They travel through Gondor, where they are captured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2719\" href=\"/faramir/4005-2719/\">Faramir</a> and his men. After Faramir sets them free, they are lead into Cirith Ungol, where Gollum hopes to induce the monstrous Shelob to kill the hobbits so he may steal the Ring. The initial attack fails, however Shelob manages to sneak up on Frodo, while Sam is attacked by Gollum. Sam is able to drive off both Gollum and Shelob, but not before Frodo is stung by Shelob. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam takes the Ring from him to continue the quest. He learns that Frodo is not dead only after his unconscious body has been captured by Orcs</p><h3>The Return of the King</h3><p>Sam rescues Frodo from the Orcs of Cirith Ungol. Giving him back the Ring, they disguise themselves as Orcs as they make their way across the desolate wastes of Mordor. They manage to make their way to Mount Doom due to a distraction staged by Gandalf and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62741\" href=\"/aragorn/4005-62741/\">Aragorn</a>. After the Ring is destroyed at the Crack of Doom, Sam and Frodo are rescued off the slopes by Great Eagles. At Aragorn's coronation he is honoured alongside the other hobbits. Returning to the Shire with the others, they find it in ruins under the oppressive rule of a being called \"Sharkey,\" really the evil wizard <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62765\" href=\"/saruman/4005-62765/\">Saruman</a>. Sam and the other three hobbits lead an uprising that frees the Shire. Sam helps to rebuild the Shire, taking special care to replant many of the trees that had been destroyed. He marries Rosie Cotton, with whom he has thirteen children, and is elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive terms. He travels to the Grey Havens with Frodo, who is leaving for the Undying Lands, and returns to the Shire afterwards, inheriting all of Frodo's possessions. After the death of his wife some years later he disappears from the Shire, possibly to travel to the Undying Lands.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Sam is competent with a sword and a bow.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p> </p><p>In the first age of Middle Earth, the Balrogs (or \"Belryg\") were Maiar, of the same order as <a href=\"/gandalf/4005-62740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62740\">Gandalf</a>, <a href=\"/saruman/4005-62765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62765\">Saruman</a> and <a href=\"/sauron/4005-55835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55835\">Sauron</a>. .</p><p>The Balrogs were fiercely loyal to the first dark lord, Morgoth. At least one Balrog, later know as Durin's Bane, survived after the defeat of Morgoth. He fled into the Misty Mountains, where he hibernated until he was awoken by the dwarf miners, lead by Durin. Durin was slain, thus earning the Balrog his name. Durin's Bane remained in hiding within the Mines of Moria, until he was awoken again.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>On their journey to destroy the one ring, the <a href=\"/the-fellowship-of-the-ring/4060-56586/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56586\">Fellowship of the Ring</a> was forced to travel through the Mines of Moria. During a battle with a group of Orcs, the fellowship accidentally reawakened the Balrog. He followed them to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. Here, the wizard <a href=\"/gandalf/4005-62740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62740\">Gandalf</a> faced the Balrog. Gandalf successfully saved the fellowship, but in the process the Balrog and he slew each other, ending the creatures life.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h4>Video Games</h4><p>The Balrog has been featured in numerous video game adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's The <i>Lord of the Rings </i>trilogy.</p><h4>Animation</h4><p>The Balrog appeared in Ralph Bakshi's adaptation of Tolkien's first two novels in the <i>Lord of the Rings </i>trilogy. Here is is portrayed as a large, bipedal lion, with the ability to fly via wings.</p><h4>Film</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96230/1826732-balrog.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1826732\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 750px\" data-ratio=\"1.2626666666667\" data-width=\"750\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96230/1826732-balrog.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1826732\"><img alt=\" The Balrog as he appears in Jackson's films.\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/96230/1826732-balrog.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96230/1826732-balrog.jpg 750w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/96230/1826732-balrog.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/96230/1826732-balrog.jpg 506w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" data-width=\"506\"></a><figcaption> The Balrog as he appears in Jackson's films.</figcaption></figure><p>The Balrog appeared in Peter Jackson's live action adaptations of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring </i>and <i>The Two Towers</i>.

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br /></h2>Mr.Windom was a good man of conscious and a member of the Board of Directors, who found out about his company, <em>American Chemron Industries</em>, illegally dumping toxic waste chemicals. When he brought this to his fellow board members they laughed at him and told him to keep quiet. When he told them he was going to the police, they shot him and dumped his body into a toxic waste tank and left . The toxic waste resurrected Mr.Windom and gave him powers, but it ate his face and hair. Filled with hatred he blamed his fellow board members and went to \"collect\" his revenge on them. When he encounted the first one he killed him and took his left eye and placed it on his face .The next one he killed, he took his right eye .He continued this pattern until he came to the last two, but when he was about to kill them <strong><a data-ref-id=\"4005-7206\" href=\"/dracula/4005-7206/\"> Dracula </a></strong>(who was trying to feed on them) had entered the room. Demanding this Faceless Man leave, Dracula voiced his desire to feed on them, but Windom wanted revenge. So they fought and Windom, to Dracula`s surprise, threw him out of a window and he killed the last two. Dracula still hungry went after Windom but he was too late, for poor Windom when finished with his revenge dissolved himself into a pool of protoplasm, praying for eternal peace .",

    "deck": "A superhero/cop he works with police but he eventually realizes that not killing doesn't stop evil, so he begins killing villains and other unsavory characters.",
    "description": "<p>John Dusk is a man possessing the power to create an aura which he can shape and use in many ways. He has used this aura to glide and  float from the tops of buildings, as means of holding someone in place kind of like ropes, hold someones mouth shut and pressed against wounds to prevent bleeding and in very lethal ways. John Dusk has often and effectively used it as a bladed or sharp sided weapon (he has sliced throats and caused other physical harm with just a wave of his finger) and he has implemented it as a projectile weapon (he occasionally points his finger like a gun and the aura forms a beam and shoots through a culprits head leaving a bullet hole looking injury he has used this ability in more brutal and messy ways also). He uses his aura to fight evil and uphold the law as not just a super hero but as a police officer. He and a couple other heroes, with and without powers, form a team that the police uses as a super powered S.W.A.T team. The members are very effective and close, they go to each others home for barbecues and know each others family well. After years of super heroics and seeing the many evil deeds of people, super powered or not, John begins to question the justice system he has worked for and believed in for many years. After a rather dark experience something snaps in John and his methods change, his police duties become a bloody quest for vengeance and peace. <br/> <br/>John Dusk had been fighting crime for some time but the evil things he has witnessed start to haunt him day and night. He had never intentionally killed anyone until one fateful encounter with a racist, rapist with super strength named White Power. While White Power held John in a bear hug he could only escape by using his aura to slice White Powers arms off. John, in usual heroic fashion, used his powers to keep his enemy alive by stopping the bleeding with his powers while he called for police back up and an ambulance. While he restrained White Power he begins to search for a muffled sound he heard he finds the source in a back room and John shocked by his discovery. White Power had two women bound and gagged to two beds. White Power had kidnapped the women and held them prisoner for days, continually raping them and leaving them beaten, abused and malnourished. John disgusted by this he decided to let the man die, he removed his protective aura from his wounds and White Power quickly bled out, even though White Power was a horrible person John was still shocked by his choice and still question his decision. John has to report to the police chief what \"actually happened\" but John lies to protect himself but luckily John's boy scout like demeanor and spotless career allow him to get away without punishment or question.  After discussing his version of what happened with the police chief, he is again reminded of all the horrid things he has witnessed over his eight years working with the police. John is surprised in the stations hall by his girlfriend, homicide detective, Karen. That night while John and Karen are having sex john stops because he was again haunted by the image of the terrible things he has seen, this time he sees an image of one of White Powers rape victims. John with the help of his super team, which consists of Alpha, the Servant and himself, storm a hideout that a wanted pyrokinetic villain has been staying at. The four of them along with a group of officers finally capture the villain and some of his gang, basically the ones he did not burn to death trying to escape. After the raid he, Karen, the Servant and his family attend a barbecue at Alphas home. While Karen and Alpha converse John smiles as he watches the children in the pool but his smile quickly fades as he again has a flashback of a sadistic crimes he has seen. He remembers and is most haunted by the crime that had a young girl being chopped up and sewn back together with other children's limbs. (This heinous act can be seen in Absolution number zero, he relives the event in a nightmare.  Also in issue zero we learn the police are hunting a serial killer that does not leave bullets in the body or environment.) The serial killer the police are baffled by is none other than John Dusk. A conversation between John and Karen in front of the court house leads him to pick his next victim, Karen tells John about a pervert she saw in court who was masturbating during court proceedings. Eventually John is called to court to testify about what happened with White Power and John sees what he thinks might be the man Karen told him about. While John Is in testifying on the stand he realizes the guy is who Karen told him about. Later that night we see John stalking the pervert and when he confronts the man he challenges John and his motives. The guy knows John is one of the good guys and can not prove he has done anything so he \"knows\" John can not and will not do anything to him. John tells him a little about how he views not killing compared to actually killing culprits and that leaving them alive does not help the world. John then shows the guy his face right before he uses his aura to \"shoot\" him through the forehead, this left no bullet in him or around him. One night while he can not sleep he suits up and begins to patrol the city to get out and clear his head. While out he responds to a domestic disturbance call that is quite severe. A man had been cut by his wife, probably in self defense, he demanded John call the ambulance for him but John looks at what is left of the guys wife. The woman's body laid mutilated on the floor her husband had beaten her to death in \"self defense,\" brain was exposed, an eye barely intact she was very messed up. John knew the man was in the wrong but still remained calm and still followed procedure. John politely asked the man to stay calm while the man demanded John call him an ambulance for his cut arm. John tells him hes fine and the wound is merely superficial but the man gets in Johns face and continues yelling to which John asks him to step back because he is bleeding but this only makes the man angrier. He claims John is saying hes got A.I.Ds and  will sue him for slander saying he is calling him gay and that John is a racist and goes on about that so John uses his power to slit the mans throat. John was actually surprised by his action but then uses the knife in the cut he made in the husband and puts the knife back in the mans hand to set the scene up as a murder suicide.</p>",

    "deck": "A British spiritualist and \"medium\", now best known for his association with the Jack the Ripper case",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Robert James Lees was born in 1849. He claimed that his first psychic experience occurred when he was three, and that he had a spirt companion who would often sit by his side in childhood. In 1861 he claimed that he had gone unto a trance following the death of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30943\" href=\"/queen-victoria/4005-30943/\" slug=\"queen-victoria\">Queen Victoria's</a> husband, Albert, and that he was able to deliver messages between the Queen and her consort. He further claimed that he had been kept in Buckingham Palace for a short period of time at the behest of the queen, who wanted to keep him close to allow communication with Albert. There is no evidence for this claim or any of his others, and the only evidence that exists of his communication with the royal family is a letter sent to him in 1899 thanking him for the free gift of one of his books made to the queen.  <br/><br/>In 1871 Lees married Sarah Ann Bishop, a childhood sweetheart. Together they had sixteen children, six of whom died in infancy. In 1876 he moved he family to Manchester where he took work as a journalist for the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>. They remained there for only two years, before in 1878 he moved the family to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> where he took work as a journalist for a number of London-based publications. As well as his journalistic pursuits,  Lees published several books despite his lack of education, the most famous of these being <i>The Mists Trilogy</i>, a series of three books which he wrote between 1898 and 1931. In 1902 he moved his family to Ilfracombe, where he remained until 1928 before returning to his childhood home of Leicester. He died there in 1931 at the age of 81.  <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Jack the Ripper </h3>Lees is now almost only remembered for the fact that he claimed to know the identity of the serial killer known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a>, who was active in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a> in 1888. Lees lived in London at the time, and his diaries record that he went to both the City of London Police and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56630\" href=\"/scotland-yard/4060-56630/\" slug=\"scotland-yard\">Scotland Yard</a> in October of 1888 to offer his services in the hunt for the killer. Both agencies rejected his offer. In 1805 an oft-repeated report first appeared in April in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55728\" href=\"/chicago-illinois/4020-55728/\" slug=\"chicago-illinois\"><i>Chicago</i></a><i> Herald</i>. This report stated that Lees had been troubled by visions of the Ripper committing his crimes, and that his visions had invariably come true. Allegedly he and his wife had been travelling on an omnibus when he indicated a man and told his wife that the man was Jack the Ripper. His wife scoffed, but he followed the man off of he bus and located a police officer. The police officer didn't believe him either, however several murders later, Lees was able to convince the police to follow him to a fashionable house that was owned by a noted physician. This physician, who had been incriminated in some fashion not detailed, was then given a mock burial and committed to an asylum under the name Thomas Mason.    <br/>  <br/>This theory came to prominence again in 1970, when Dr Thomas Stowell wrote an article about his theory regarding Jack the Ripper, and in it reported that his mentor's wife, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62785\" href=\"/caroline-cameron-gull/4005-62785/\" slug=\"caroline-cameron-gull\">Caroline Gull</a>, had told him a story about a police inspector and a man claiming to be a medium who came to her father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30940\" href=\"/william-gull/4005-30940/\" slug=\"william-gull\">William Gull's</a> home. This story, if true matches up with Lees' claim that that he confronted the murderous doctor in his home. This theory also ties in with Stephen Knight's 1976 book <i>Jack the Ripper: the Final Solution</i>, which posits a royal or masonic conspiracy. Both of these theories have been widely discredited, and most Ripperologists dismiss both Lees' claims and the claims of those based on his.<br/><h2>In Other Media</h2>Lees' appearances in other media have been limited to his association with the Ripper case. The most well known is perhaps in <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's</a> <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\">From Hell</a></i>, where he is depicted as a charlatan who, interestingly, always makes correct predictions. He is instrumental in leading <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62781\" href=\"/frederick-george-abberline/4005-62781/\" slug=\"frederick-george-abberline\">Inspector Abberline</a> to the home of William Gull, the Ripper. The book suggests that the pair remained friends after the murders, and also implies that they were paid to remain silent about the identity of the murderer.   <br/> <br/>He also appears in the 1979 film <i>Murder By Decree</i>, where he was played by Donald Sutherland, and in the 1988 television miniseries <i>Jack the Ripper</i> where he was played by Ken Bones. ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Frederick George Abberline was born in 1843, the son of a saddle maker and minor local politician. His father died when Abberline was 6, and his widowed mother raised him and his three siblings alone. He worked as a clockmaker until 1863, when he left home and joined the <a href=\"/scotland-yard/4060-56630/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56630\">Metropolitan Police</a> just shy of his 20th birthday. Two years later he was promoted to Sergeant. A further two years later he spent most of the year investigating the actions of Fenians in <a href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\">London</a>. In 1873 he was promoted to Inspector, and shortly after the promotion he was first assigned to <a href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\">Whitechapel</a>. In 1878 he was appointed Local Inspector in the Criminal Investigation Department of Whitechapel. In 1887 he was promoted out of Whitechapel to Whitehall before moving to the Central Office of Scotland Yard and being promoted to Inspector First-Class in early 1888. After the murder of <a href=\"/mary-ann-nichols/4005-62795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62795\">Mary Ann Nichols</a> on August 31st, 1888, Abberline was moved back to Whitechapel do to his extensive experience in the area. He managed the investigations of the <a href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\">Jack the Ripper</a> murders. In 1889 he was involved in the investigation of the Cleveland Street Scandal. In February of 1892 he retired from the police force. He was briefly involved in private detection, before taking over the European division of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, where he continued to work for the next twelve years. In 1904 he retired to Bournemouth </p><p> </p><p>In 1868 he married his first wife, Martha Mackness, who died two months later of tuberculosis. In 1876 he married his second wife, <a href=\"/emma-beamont-abberline/4005-62952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62952\">Emma Beament</a>, with whom he would remain until his death over 50 years later. He died in late 1929 in Bournemouth at the age of 86 of natural causes. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Jack the Ripper</h3><p>Abberline is best remembered for his association with the Jack the Ripper case. At the time, Abberline was known to favour George Chapman, a serial poisoner, as Jack the Ripper. Opponents to this theory have pointed out that the chance of a serial killer changing M.O. so completely seems extremely unlikely, as well as the fact that the Ripper killed strangers while Chapman killed wives or mistresses. There is no known hard evidence against Chapman. </p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p>Abberline frequently appears in Ripper fiction, and is often used as the protagonist of the story. He appeared in a highly fictionalised form in <a href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\">Alan Moore's</a> <a href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\"><i>From Hell</i></a>, in which he eventually uncovered the suspect and was forced into silence. He also appeared in the extremely loose film adaptation in which his character was combined with <a href=\"/robert-james-lees/4005-62780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62780\">Robert Lees</a> and given psychic powers. This version was played by Johnny Depp. He was also played by Michael Caine in a TV movie called <i>Jack the Ripper</i>. He appears as a supporting character in the drama series <em>Ripper Street</em>, portrayed by Clive Russell. Often Abberline is portrayed as an addict, usually an alcoholic, which is unsubstantiated by contemporary evidence. As well he is sometimes portrayed as single and in his mid-30s during the killings, while he had actually been married for over a decade and was 45 at the time. </p>",

    "deck": "An English carriage driver best known for his alleged involvement in the Jack the Ripper murders ",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2> John Netley was born c. 1860 in Paddington, the son of an omnibus driver. He was born a twin, but his brother, William Henry, died before the boys were more than a few months old. In 1888 Netley was working as a Hackney carriage driver in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a>. Netley died in 1903 when his carriage struck an obelisk on London's Park Road, throwing him under the hooves of his horses and crushing his head beneath the wheel of his own cab.  <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Jack the Ripper</h3>In 1976 he was first implicated in the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> murders in Stephen Knight's book <i>Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution</i>. In this work Knight suggested that Netley drove the carriage for the murderer, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30940\" href=\"/william-gull/4005-30940/\" slug=\"william-gull\">William Gull</a>, and assisted in carrying out the murders for the so-called \"royal conspiracy\". He was also alleged to have attempted to murder <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62783\" href=\"/alice-margaret-crook/4005-62783/\" slug=\"alice-margaret-crook\">Alice Crook</a>, the supposed illegitimate daughter of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30937\" href=\"/prince-albert-victor/4005-30937/\" slug=\"prince-albert-victor\">Prince Albert Victor</a>, by trying to run her down with her carriage and, when this failed, committing suicide by throwing himself into the River Thames. However, the royal conspiracy has been widely discredited, and many of the roads where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage to fit down them as has been alleged. As well, Netley died 15 years after the end of the murders, not shortly after as was suggested in the theory. <br/><h2>In Other Media</h2>Nonetheless, Netley has made several appearances in fiction, usually as the semi-willing subordinate of William Gull. Most notably this portrayal appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's</a> <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\">From Hell</a></i>. He also appeared in the film \"adaptation\", where he was portrayed by Jason Flemyng. Earlier appearances were in <i>Murder By Decree</i>, where his name was changed to William Slade and he was played by Peter Jonfield, and in the TV movie <i>Jack the Ripper</i> where he was played by George Sweeney. ",

He alleged that the  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> murders were carried out by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30940\" href=\"/william-gull/4005-30940/\" slug=\"william-gull\">William Gull</a> to silence  Mary Kelly and her friends, who were aware of the embarrassing affair and were attempting to blackmail the government with this information.  </p> <p>This theory, commonly dubbed the \"royal conspiracy\", has been widely discredited for a number of reasons. While it is true that Annie and Alice both existed, and Gorman was indeed Alice's son, he was one of five children born to her and her husband, William Gorman; there is no evidence he was the product of an affair. Alice herself would have been conceived sometime in the summer of 1884, when the Prince was in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\" href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\" slug=\"germany\">Germany</a> and thus unavailable to father her. Alice herself later stated that her father was named  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62792\" href=\"/william-crook/4005-62792/\" slug=\"william-crook\">William Crook</a>, which was the name of her grandfather, and has been suggested by some to indicate that she was the product of an incestuous union between Annie and her father, though there is of course no proof of this conjecture.  </p> <p>It has also been pointed out that no records exist of the marriage between the Prince and Annie, and even if they had married, their marriage would have been invalidated because he had failed to gain the approval of his grandmother, voiding it through the Royal Marriages Act of 1772. As well, the home in which Annie was alleged to have been kept along with her daughter, 6 Cleveland Street, had been torn down before April of 1888, and both she and Alice were paupers, with no indication they were receiving money from a wealthy patron. Gorman claimed that Annie was a Catholic, but there is no evidence to support it, and even if it were true it would have simply removed Albert Victor and any children produced by the union, including Alice, from the line of succession, due to the Act of Settlement of 1701.  </p> <p>There is no indication that Alice and Walter Sickert knew one another, let alone were engaged in an affair. Further, there is no indication that Sickert knew any member of the royal family, nor that he knew Annie. There is also no proof that he knew the victims of the Ripper, or that they knew each other, Annie or Alice. Even if they had known one another, the chances that their story of a royal illegitimacy would have been believed were fairly slim. Alice herself never made any such claims.</p> <p>Shortly after the book putting the claims forward, <i>Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution</i>, was published, Joseph Gorman retracted his testimony and admitted he had fabricated all of it. Nonetheless, the royal conspiracy theory has remained immensely popular, especially in popular fiction, where Alice most notably appeared as a child in  Eddie Campbell and  Alan Moore's <i>From Hell</i>. She also appeared in the film \"adaptation\", where she was played by Poppy Rogers</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>James Hinton was born in 1822, the son of a Baptist minister and author. In his youth he was educated at a school run by his grandfather, and at the Nonconformist school in Harpenden. His  father moved the family to London in 1838, and the young Hinton was apprenticed to a woolen-draper in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a>. He remained apprenticed there for about a year, then became a clerk in an insurance office. He spent every night studying, and began to focus intensely on moral issues. At the age of eighteen he tried to flee his problems by fleeing to the sea, but was stopped before he was able to go through with his plan. He was sent to St. Bartholomew's Hospital where he received his education in medicine. He received his degree in medicine in 1847. After graduation he spent some time as an assistant surgeon before travelling to Sierra Leon to act as a medical officer aboard a ship heading to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56026\" href=\"/jamaica/4020-56026/\" slug=\"jamaica\">Jamaica</a>.  <br/> <br/>He stayed there until 1850, when he returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\" href=\"/england/4020-55794/\" slug=\"england\">England</a> and set himself up as an aural surgeon in a partnership with a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> surgeon and studied physiology. In 1856 he published his first written works, most of them essays regarding ethical and moral concerns, and many on physiological issues. In 1863 he was appointed aural surgeon at Guy's Hospital, which is where he first met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30940\" href=\"/william-gull/4005-30940/\" slug=\"william-gull\">William Gull</a>. He was noted as the most skillful aural surgeon at the time. In 1866 he published <i>The Mystery of Pain</i>. In 1874 he published three works, <i>An Atlas of Diseases of the membrana tympani</i>,<i> The Place of the Physician</i>, and <i>Questions of Aural Surgery</i>. His health declined rapidly in 1874 and he retired to the Azores, where he died of acute cerebral inflammation on December 16th 1875 at the age of 53   <br/><h2>In Other Media</h2>Hinton is best remembered for his association with William Gull, and because of this he has often been associated with the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> case following the naming of Gull as a suspect in the 1970s. In <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\"><i>From Hell</i></a> he is portrayed as an idealistic and metaphysically-minded man who is preoccupied with the problem of prostitution in the East End of London, in contrast to the less caring, more material Gull.  <br/> <br/>Hinton's association was mentioned in Stephen Knight's <i>Jack the Ripper: the Final Solution</i> and Iain Sinclair's <i>White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings</i>. He tends to not be mentioned outside of proponents of the theory of Gull as murderer, due mainly to the fact that he died thirteen years before the murders. ",

    "deck": "An English man with deformities exhibited as a curiosity or a freak in the late 19th century",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Joseph Merrick was born in Leicester in 1862, the son of an engine driver and haberdasher. He had no outward signs of deformities in his early years. He had two younger siblings, one of whom died in infancy, while the other had physical disabilities. Merrick himself reported that he began showing deformities when he was about five, beginning as thick and lumpy skin that was greyish in colour. Other sources report his deformities began when he was just under two years of age, and were begun as swellings of the lips and a bony growth on his forehead. In either case, his arms began to grow markedly different in size, and his feet began to swell. He also suffered an injury to his leg in childhood that caused him to have a permanent limp. Despite his deformities he attended public school. </p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>He left school at the age of twelve, and from there attempted several times to leave home and seek gainful employment in a factory or as a hawker. However, his deformities prevented skilled work with his hands, and customers could not understand his speech due to his facial deformities. He was briefly cared for by an uncle until entering the Leicester Union Workhouse at 17. In 1884 he offered himself as a human curiosity. He was exhibited in a shop on the <a href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\">Whitechapel</a> Road, which was located across the street from the <a href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\">London</a> Hospital. He received a number of doctors interested in his case, most notably Frederick Treves. In 1885 his shop in Whitechapel was shut down due to changing sensibilities regarding freak shows, and he travelled to continental <a href=\"/europe/4020-56099/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56099\">Europe</a>, where he was eventually abandoned by his manager, who stole all of his savings, forcing him to travel back to England on his own. He arrived in England in 1886, but had nowhere to go, and was unable to communicate due to his speech-obstructing deformities. A police officer helped him contact Treves, who had given Merrick a business card. Merrick was admitted to the London Hospital for bronchitis.</p><p>There, he received treatment and was eventually permanently housed with the help of public donations solicited through <em>The Times.</em> He received his own rooms in the attic, and became a curiosity for society patrons, including <a href=\"/alexandra-of-denmark/4005-62796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62796\">Princess Alexandra</a> and other members of the royal family. He became close friends with Treves, and spent most days reading or constructing a model of a church. Throughout the last years of his life his health steadily deteriorated. On April 11th, 1890 Merrick died at the age of 27. An inquest into his death was conducted by <a href=\"/wynne-edwin-baxter/4005-62803/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62803\">Wynne Edwin Baxter</a>, and was ruled accidental. The cause of death was formally given as asphyxia. Treves, who conducted the autopsy, declared that it had been caused by a dislocated neck, brought on by the enormous weight of his head. </p><h3>Condition</h3><p>The cause of his deformities is unknown. At the time, the belief in \"maternal impression\" was strong, suggesting that a powerful psychological influence on the mother would cause an imprint on the child she was carrying. Merrick's mother had been startled by an elephant at a fair while pregnant with Merrick, and this was suggested as the cause of his deformities. This was the version that Merrick believed all his life. Current theory has been unable to give a conclusive cause, but several suggestions have been made. Tests of these theories have proven inconclusive thus far. </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><p><em><strong>The Elephant Man</strong></em></p><p>Merrick appears as the main and title character of this critically acclaimed 1980 biographical film, directed by <a href=\"/david-lynch/4040-62591/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-62591\">David Lynch</a>. He is portrayed by John Hurt. </p><p><em><strong>From Hell</strong></em></p><p>Merrick appears as a minor background character in this film, primarily concerned with the contemporary <a href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\">Jack the Ripper</a> murders. He is portrayed by Anthony Parker.</p><p><em><strong>How to Make a David Lynch Film</strong></em></p><p>Merrick appears as a minor character in this metafilm's exploration of the making of a David Lynch film.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Theodore Dyke Acland was born in 1851, the son of Sir Henry Wentworth Acland. He received his education from Winchester College and Christ Church. He attended Oxford University, where he received a Master of Arts, as well as the University of Leipzig and the University of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55686\" href=\"/berlin/4020-55686/\" slug=\"berlin\">Berlin</a>. He received medical training at St. Thomas' Hospital. In 1883 he received his Doctor of Medicine from Oxford University, and became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. That same year he was sent to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55877\" href=\"/egypt/4020-55877/\" slug=\"egypt\">Egypt</a> to deal with an outbreak of cholera. He became Principle Medical Officer in the Egyptian Army, as well as receiving the Order of the Medjidie. He eventually rose to the rank of Brevet Lieutenant Colonel. In 1888 he married <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30940\" href=\"/william-gull/4005-30940/\" slug=\"william-gull\">William Gull's</a> daughter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62785\" href=\"/caroline-cameron-gull/4005-62785/\" slug=\"caroline-cameron-gull\">Caroline Gull</a>. In 1889 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. Also in 1889 his first child, Aimee Sarah Agnes Dyke Acland was born, but later died in infancy. In 1890 his second child, Theodore William Gull Acland was born. In 1893 he became physician at St. Thomas' Hospital, where he later became Consulting Physician. He also became Governor of St. Thomas' Hospital, as well as of Royal Brompton Hospital. He also consulted for a number of boards and councils. In 1900 he became Medical Adviser to Reginald Wingate in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56030\" href=\"/sudan/4020-56030/\" slug=\"sudan\">Sudan</a>. During the First World War he worked as a consulting physician in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a>. He died on April 16th 1931 at the age of 79. In August of that same year he received a posthumous Order of the Nile, second class.  <br/><h2>In Other Media</h2>Acland is tied to the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> case mainly through his association with William Gull, who has been identified since the 1970s as being related in some way to the murders. He was first mentioned in the case by Dr Thomas E.A. Stowell, who studied under Acland and who suggested that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30937\" href=\"/prince-albert-victor/4005-30937/\" slug=\"prince-albert-victor\">Prince Albert Victor</a> was the Ripper, and that Gull had attempted to certify him insane. Stowell claimed to have gotten most of his evidence from Caroline, Acland's wife. Later authors went further, especially Stephen Knight, suggested that the Acland's signing of his father-in-law's death certificate was indicative of his covering up the fact that Gull, the killer, had been certified insane and remanded to a mental institution and that Gull's death and subsequent burial was a sham intended to cover for the plot. <br/> <br/>He appeared in the miniseries <i>Jack the Ripper</i>, where he was played by actor Richard Morant. ",

    "deck": "One of Jack the Ripper's victims, she was the third murdered and first on the night of the so-called \"double event\"",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Elizabeth Stride was born Elisabeth Gusatsdotter just west of Gothenburg, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55925\" href=\"/sweden/4020-55925/\" slug=\"sweden\">Sweden</a>. Unlike the other victims of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> she fell into prostitution fairly early, having been registered as one by the Swedish authorities as early as 1865. She was treated several times for venereal disease and gave birth to a stillborn child before moving to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> in 1866. The reasons for this move are unclear and variously given as to become a domestic servant for a family in Hyde Park, or to work for an unknown \"foreign gentleman\". Three years later in 1869 she married John Thomas Stride. Together the operated a coffee house in East London. She was working in the Poplar Workhouse in 1877, which implied that she and her husband had separated. In 1878 the <i>Princess Alice</i> disaster occurred in the River Thames, and Liz claimed that her husband and two of her nine children had died in the sinking, however she had no children and she and her husband reconciled in 1881, though they had separated again by the end of that year. Her husband actually died in 1884.  </p> <p>After their separation Liz lived mostly in common lodging houses in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a> and received charitable support from the Church of Sweden twice in May of 1886, and twice again in September of 1888. From 1885 she had an on-and-off relationship with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62951\" href=\"/michael-kidney/4005-62951/\" slug=\"michael-kidney\">Michael Kidney</a>, with whom she frequently lived. In the months leading up to her death she was often brought into court on charges of being drunk and disorderly. During this time she earned money as a domestic, a seamstress and infrequently as a prostitute. She learned Yiddish as well as English during her time in England. In 1887 she was again registered as an inmate of Poplar Workhouse, and in late 1887 she charged Kidney with assault, but didn't attend court. She left Michael Kidney for the last time on September 25th 1888, about which he was not particularly concerned as she frequently disappeared for days at a time. </p> <h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Elizabeth Stride was murdered on September 30th. At around 11 p.m. she was seen at a pub kissing a man wearing a billycock hat. The couple was taunted by two labourers, who warned Stride jokingly that she was with Leather Apron, the nickname at the time for Jack the Ripper. The couple soon exited the pub. She was seen again at 11:45 talking with another man with whom she was also outwardly affectionate. She was not definitely seen again until 12:35, when she was seen by a police constable to be talking with a man wearing a deerstalker hat. At approximately 12:45 a woman was seen being thrown to the street by a man who was probably not the same as the one who was seen with her earlier.  </p> <p>At 1 a.m. her body was discovered in Dutfield's Yard next to the International Working Men's Educational Club. Her throat had been cut. It is believed that the discoverer scared Jack the Ripper away before he could perform any mutilation. If true, this was presumably what caused him to seek out the second victim of the double event, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62819\" href=\"/catherine-eddowes/4005-62819/\" slug=\"catherine-eddowes\">Catherine Eddowes</a>. Elizabeth was buried on October 6th, 1888.   </p>",

Annie was alleged by her grandson, Joseph Gorman, to have secretly married <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30937\" href=\"/prince-albert-victor/4005-30937/\" slug=\"prince-albert-victor\">Prince Albert Victor</a> and borne a child by him, her daughter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62783\" href=\"/alice-margaret-crook/4005-62783/\" slug=\"alice-margaret-crook\">Alice Crook</a>. Later in her life, Alice claimed that her father was named William Crook, and some have claimed this as proof that she was the product of an incestuous union between William and his daughter. There is no known evidence for or against this claim.  <br/> <br/>William died in 1891, at the age of 61.   </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Annie Chapman was the daughter of a soldier. She married her husband John Chapman in 1869 when she was 26. They had three children together, one of whom died in adolescence. Another was a cripple who was sent to a home to be cared for. Annie and John separated either in 1884 or 1885 for reasons that were never clearly given, but which were cited by the police as her drunken and immoral ways. Both she and her husband were noted to have a problem with drink, though she was never described as an alcoholic. Her husband supported her with weekly payments until his death in 1886. After his death Annie was noted by friends as being depressed and melancholy. Also in 1886 she was noted to be living in a common lodging house with a man whose name was given as John Sivvey, and who left her soon after her husband died.  <br/> <br/>It was only after her husband died that Chapman began to engage in prostitution. Prior to this she had been able to support herself on his weekly payments and selling flowers and crochet work. In May or June of 1888 she entered into a relationship with a bricklayer's mate, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62820\" href=\"/edward-stanley/4005-62820/\" slug=\"edward-stanley\">Edward Stanley</a>. He would frequently pay for her bed, and that of her friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62818\" href=\"/eliza-cooper/4005-62818/\" slug=\"eliza-cooper\">Eliza Cooper</a>. Shortly before her death,  Chapman and Cooper quarreled, the fight coming to blows and leaving  Chapman with a black eye. The reason for the fight has never been suitably given. In the days leading up to her death  Chapman told several different friends that she felt poorly and intended to check herself into an infirmary, though there are no records that she ever did so. It is possible that she simply went there to obtain medicine, as some was found in her room.  <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2>Annie Chapman was murdered on September 8th, 1888. The night before, she was seen by her friend, Amelia Palmer, who inquired whether Chapman was off to solicit trade. Chapman replied that she was too ill to do so. Palmer left but returned shortly after to find Chapman in the same place. Chapman told her friend that she had to go out in order to get lodging money. At 11:30 she returned to the lodging house, and shortly after 12 had a drink in the kitchen with another lodger, who stated that Chapman seemed to already be fairly drunk. A few minutes later another lodger entered and saw her with medicine that she presumably obtained at the casual ward. She leaves shortly afterwards, and the men believe she has gone to bed. She returned to the lodging house at 1:35 a.m. and indicated that she didn't have the money for her bed but intended to soon. She asks that a bed be held for her and leaves again. At 4:45 a man enters the backyard of 29 Hanbury Street where Chapman would soon be found, and sees nothing out of the ordinary. Chapman herself isn't seen again until 5:30 when she is seen talking to a man, presumably a client, in front of 29 Hanbury Street. A few minutes later a man passing by the yard hears a woman cry out and something fall against the 5 foot tall fence. Her body was found shortly before 6 a.m. Her throat had been slit, and her abdomen cut open. Her intestines had been removed from her torso and arranged around her shoulders. Several organs had been completely removed. It has been suggested that some of her wounds, especially her swollen face and tongue, were indicative of suffocation. She was buried on September 14th. ",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Mary Ann Nichols was the daughter of a locksmith. Very little of her life is known until 1864, when she married <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62807\" href=\"/william-nichols/4005-62807/\" slug=\"william-nichols\">William Nichols</a>. Together they had 5 children, the last of whom was born in 1879. The marriage dissolved sometime in 1880 or 1881. The cause is unknown, but attributed by the police to her alcoholism. Her husband supported her with legally mandated weekly payments until 1882, when he discovered that she was supplementing her income with prostitution. He claimed that he did not have to support her both because it was she who had left him, and also because of her prostitution.   </p><p>After their separation Nichols spent several years in and out of various workhouses, occasionally interspersed with time spent with her father, who believed she was dissolute and destined for a bad end. Despite this, he still described her as a good woman with few enemies. Between 1883 and 1887 it is believed that she lived infrequently with a man named Thomas Dew. On May 12th, 1888 she obtained domestic employment, which she held for two months before leaving after stealing from her employers. </p><b><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2></b><p>Mary Ann Nichols was murdered on August 31st. At 11 p.m. the previous night she was seen walking on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a> Road, probably soliciting. At 12:30 she was seen leaving a pub, probably having spent any money earned earlier in the night. Between 1:20 and 1:40 she was expelled from her lodging house because she had no doss money. She referenced a new bonnet that she had, and headed back out onto the street. At 2:30 she met a friend, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62805\" href=\"/emily-holland/4005-62805/\" slug=\"emily-holland\">Emily Holland</a>, while walking the streets. She told Holland that she had already spent her doss money several times that night on alcohol, and Holland described her friend as appearing very drunk. At 3:15 police officers on their regular beat reported no unusual activity at Buck's Row. Sometime between 3:40 and 3:45 her body was found. She was pronounced dead by Dr. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62799\" href=\"/rees-ralph-llewellyn/4005-62799/\" slug=\"rees-ralph-llewellyn\">Rees Ralph Llewellyn</a>, who believed that she was found only moments after she had died. Her throat had been cut, and her lower torso had been extensively mutilated with a knife. She was buried on September 6th, 1888. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Alexandra of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56518\" href=\"/denmark/4020-56518/\" slug=\"denmark\">Denmark</a> was born in 1844, the daughter of Christian IX, who was named Prince of Denmark when Alexandra was eight. Her family moved to Bernstorff Palace where, although their status had risen, the family remained relatively poor. The young Alexandra made her own clothes, and lived in the attic along with her sister, Dagmar. In September of 1861 Alexandra was introduced to Prince Albert Edward, as she had been selected as the best possible wife for the Prince by his sister and his mother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30943\" href=\"/queen-victoria/4005-30943/\" slug=\"queen-victoria\">Queen Victoria</a>. The pair became engaged slightly less than a year later. In March of 1863 she left her home in Denmark and travelled by yacht to the United Kingdom, and three days after she arrived the pair was married in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.  <br/><h2>Character Evolution</h2>In 1864 her father acceded to the Danish throne and the German Confederation had invaded Denmark. Alexandra and her husband irritated the Queen by supporting the Danes. Alexandra retained her dislike of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\" href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\" slug=\"germany\">Germany</a> for the rest of her life. That same year she gave birth to her first child, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30937\" href=\"/prince-albert-victor/4005-30937/\" slug=\"prince-albert-victor\">Prince Albert Victor</a>. She would go on to have five more children, George, Louise, Victoria, Maud and John. All of them were apparently born prematurely, though it has been suggested that she lied to the Queen about her due dates so as to prevent her from being present at the births. During the birth of Louise, Alexandra had rheumatic fever, which led her to have a limp for the rest of her life. She was reportedly an excellent and caring mother, and an affectionate and happy wife. Though her husband had several semi-public affairs, they remained close and she herself remained faithful; there is no evidence of a serious split between the two. She was an avid sportswoman and socialite, both of which caused bad feelings between her and the Queen, which were only exacerbated by the Queen's continued support for the Prussians.  <br/> <br/>In 1868 Alexandra, recovering from her complicated third pregnancy, travelled with her husband to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55907\" href=\"/ireland/4020-55907/\" slug=\"ireland\">Ireland</a>, then on a world tour that lasted until 1869 in which they travelled to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55915\" href=\"/austria/4020-55915/\" slug=\"austria\">Austria</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55877\" href=\"/egypt/4020-55877/\" slug=\"egypt\">Egypt</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55847\" href=\"/greece/4020-55847/\" slug=\"greece\">Greece</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55806\" href=\"/turkey/4020-55806/\" slug=\"turkey\">Turkey</a>. During this time Alexandra was going deaf due to hereditary otosclerosis, and she spent much of her time with her children. Her final pregnancy ended in tragedy when her son, John, died a day after birth. The Queen refused to allow the mourning Princess privacy, and the tragedy was widely reported on in the press. Between 1875 and 1876 the Princess was caught up in a divorce scandal revolving around two acquaintances, the Aylesfords and the Blandfords, who attempted to drag her into the controversy. She extricated herself by going to the Queen, and her husband refused to speak to the people involved for several years. In 1877 she went to Greece where her brother, George, was king, in order to recuperate from an illness. During the Russo-Turkish War that same year she came down on the side of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55706\" href=\"/russia/4020-55706/\" slug=\"russia\">Russia</a>, where her sister Dagmar was wife of the Tsarevitch. Also in 1877 her two sons, Albert and George, were sent on a world tour with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55311\" href=\"/royal-navy/4060-55311/\" slug=\"royal-navy\">Royal Navy</a>, during which she missed them immensely. A few years later, in 1881, she travelled to Russia to spend time with her sister, now the Tsarina in the wake of the assassination of Alexander II of Russia.  <br/> <br/>During her time as Princess of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55926\" href=\"/wales/4020-55926/\" slug=\"wales\">Wales</a>, Alexandra was heavily involved in charities and social functions, many of which she undertook in the stead of the Queen who was unable to attend for various reasons. The Queen herself noted that Alexandra never complained about her duties, and often claimed to enjoy them. She spent a great deal of her time at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> Hospital, where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62787\" href=\"/joseph-merrick/4005-62787/\" slug=\"joseph-merrick\">Joseph Merrick</a>, also known as the Elephant Man, was in residence. She was a favourite of the English public, who adored her, but was less popular with the Irish public, many of whom booed her and her husband when they visited the country in 1885. The Princess took it in stride, however, and smiled throughout the ceremony they were attending. She was glowingly endorsed by the press in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\" href=\"/england/4020-55794/\" slug=\"england\">England</a>. Also in 1885 she received a Doctorate of Music from Trinity College, Dublin. In 1892 her eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, died suddenly of influenza, which dealt a heavy blow to Alexandra. Two years later her brother-in-law, the Tsar of Russia, also died, which devastated her sister.  <br/> <br/>In 1901 Queen Victoria died. Alexandra's husband succeeded to the throne as King Edward VII. She became queen-empress consort. Her duties remained basically the same, as did her household. In 1906 her father, Christian IX died. In 1907 she and her sister, the Dowager Empress of Russia, purchased a summer home in their native Denmark. In 1910 she visited the House of Commons during a debate, the first queen consort to do so. Shortly afterwards she travelled again to Greece to visit her brother. While there she was told that her husband was ill. Returning to England, she sat by his side in his last hours and cared for him. He died on May 6th. After his death she became the Queen Mother, and her son George was crowned George V. During this time she remained devoted to her social and charitable works. During the First World War she supported her son against the Germans, against whom she had always borne a hatred. In 1917 her nephew, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44057\" href=\"/czar-nicholas-ii/4005-44057/\" slug=\"czar-nicholas-ii\">Tsar Nicholas II</a>, was deposed, and he and his family were murdered in the summer of 1918. In 1919 her sister the Dowager Empress escaped Russia and came to reside in England with Alexandra.  <br/> <br/>She lived at Sandringham for most of her remaining years and never travelled abroad again. In her last years Alexandra suffered from increasing bad health. In 1920 she went partially blind temporarily after a blood vessel burst in her eye. She began to lose bother her memory and her speech. On November 20th, 1925 she suffered a fatal heart attack at the age of 80.     <br/><h3>The \"Royal Conspiracy\" </h3>The \"royal conspiracy\" is a name given to a theory revolving around the 1888 <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> murders. According to the first proponent of this theory, Dr. Thomas E A Stowell, who published his beliefs in 1970, the Ripper was in fact Alexandra's son Prince Albert Victor who had been driven mad by syphilis. In this theory the royal family, including Alexandra, conspired in keeping this information from the public. In the second royal conspiracy theory, published in 1976 by Stephen Knight in his book <i>Jack the Ripper: the Final Solution</i>, the killer was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30940\" href=\"/william-gull/4005-30940/\" slug=\"william-gull\">William Gull</a>, who had been asked to commit the murders in order to cover up the Prince's illegitimate child. This theory, most prominently used in <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's</a> <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\">From Hell</a></i>, suggests that Alexandra asked her friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46907\" href=\"/walter-sickert/4005-46907/\" slug=\"walter-sickert\">Walter Sickert</a> to take care of her son and introduce him to the realities of life outside the palace. Supposedly several prostitutes blackmailed Sickert about the illegitimate child, and Sickert turned to Alexandra, who herself turned to the Queen who ultimately ordered Gull to commit the murders. However, there is no proof that Alexandra ever knew Sickert, and the theory as a whole has been widely discredited.   ",

She was related to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62798\" href=\"/alois-hitler/4005-62798/\">Alois Hitler </a>through her mother either as first cousin, once removed or as niece. In 1876 Alois hired her to work as a domestic servant for him and his girlfriend, Franziska Matzelsberger. However, Matzelsberger did not like the young girl and had her sent away. After the death of Matzelsberger, Hitler and Polzl were married, though she continued to refer to him as \"uncle\". She was already five months pregnant at the time of the wedding. Between 1885 and 1887 she had three children, Gustav, Ida and Otto, all of whom died in infancy. In April of 1889 she gave birth to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9671\" href=\"/adolf-hitler/4005-9671/\">Adolf Hitler</a>, her first child to survive to adulthood. She was very close to Adolf, who was devastated by her passing. She also had two more children, Edmund in 1894 and Paula in 1896. Edmund died in 1900, while Paula was the only other child to survive childhood. Klara was 23 years her husband's junior, and by all accounts he ruled the household tyrannically, especially after he retired and became both verbally and physically abusive towards both Klara and the children. When he died in 1903 he left her his pension and some land, allowing her to take care of herself and her children. She died four years later of iodoform poisoning, a result of her treatment for breast cancer.  She was 43-years-old.  </p>",

    "deck": "The father of Adolf Hitler.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Alois Schiklgruber was born in Lower <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55915\" href=\"/austria/4020-55915/\">Austria</a>, the son of an unmarried peasant woman. On his birth certificate his name was not given, and he was noted as illegitimate. Hitler's paternity is undetermined, though three men have been suggested. These are Johann Georg Hiedler, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler and Leopold Frankenberg. The latter is the least supported of the suggestions. Most historians believe that his father was Georg. However this has never been conclusively proven. Some time after his birth Johann Georg Hiedler moved to the area, and, when Alois was five, married his mother, Maria. At age ten Alois was sent to live with his step-uncle, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, a farmer. While he lived with his step-uncle he attended elementary school and trained under a cobbler. When he was thirteen he went to Vienna and became an apprentice cobbler. He remained there as an apprentice for the next five years. In 1855 he joined the frontier guards of the Austrian Finance Ministry. He served in many different place across Austria in his position as a costumes official, and rose steadily through the ranks. Five years after joining he had reached the rank of \"Finanzwach Oberaufseher\", the equivalent of a non-commissioned officer. In 1875 he was an inspector of customs for Braunau. Before 1876 he used his birth name, but in 1876 he claimed that his father, Johann Georg Hiedler, had decided to legitimize him. He neglected the fact that Hiedler had been dead for twenty years at this point. In 1877 he was allowed to change his name, which became Hitler instead of Hiedler for reasons still unknown. His illegitimacy, which he admitted to fully before and after his name change did not hamper his progress in the frontier guards, rather, his lack of schooling allowed him to rise no further than full inspector of customs. Nonetheless he had done quite well for himself at the time. It is suggested that the name change was at the behest of his mother and was required in order to allow him to inherit money from her.  <br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2>Some time in the late 1860s he fathered an illegitimate child with a woman named Thelka or possibly Thekla about whom nothing else was known. In 1873 he got married for the first time, to Anna Glassl, who was 14 years his senior. When they married she was unwell, and by the end of their marriage she was an invalid. Shortly after marrying Anna he began an affair with a woman 17 years his junior, Franziska Matzelsberger. He also had a number of other affairs, which eventually led to Anna separating from Alois. Matzelsberger became Hitler's girlfriend, but they could not marry because of the Catholic prohibition against divorce. In 1876 he hired <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62797\" href=\"/klara-hitler/4005-62797/\">Klara Polzl</a> as a domestic servant, who was either his niece or first cousin once removed, depending on the identity of his father. She was 23 years his junior. In 1882 Matzelsberger gave birth to his illegitimate son, Alois Matzelsberger. Anna died in 1883, and Alois and Matzelsberger married soon after. Matzelsberger died the next year, shortly after giving birth to their second child, Angela. Soon afterwards Polzl was pregnant. Though they were possibly too closely related to allow marriage, Hitler submitted a petition to the church without mentioning she was pregnant, and the pair was allowed to marry. She continued to refer to Hitler as \"uncle\". She gave birth to their first child, Gustav, soon after the wedding, then a daughter, Ida, the following year. Otto was born in 1887, but died soon after. Gustav and Ida also died in their childhoods, but of a diphtheria outbreak. On April 20th, 1889 she gave birth to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9671\" href=\"/adolf-hitler/4005-9671/\">Adolf Hitler</a>. Edmund was born in 1894 and died in 1900, and the final child, Paula, was born in 1896. In 1895 Hitler retired to a 9-acre farm after spending forty years in civil service. He wasn't used to the difficult work of farm life, and the property quickly fell into disrepair. He wasn't used to spending time at home, and was apparently verbally and physically abusive with his young children and wife. He also became more dependent on alcohol. On January 3rd, 1903 he died of what was later described as a fit of apoplexy. He was 66-years-old.",

    "description": "<p>John Thomas Spratling was born in May of 1840. Before joining <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56630\" href=\"/scotland-yard/4060-56630/\" slug=\"scotland-yard\">Scotland Yard</a> in late 1870 he worked as a clerk. In his early years he was transferred often between divisions. In 1873 he was promoted to Sergeant, then in 1882 to Inspector third class. In 1887 he was promoted to Divisional Inspector of J Division, which encompasses Bethnal Green. In 1888 he, along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62948\" href=\"/joseph-henry-helson/4005-62948/\" slug=\"joseph-henry-helson\">Joseph Helson</a>, investigated the murder of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62795\" href=\"/mary-ann-nichols/4005-62795/\" slug=\"mary-ann-nichols\">Mary Ann Nichols</a>, which had occurred in their division. He wrote the initial report on the murder, but the case was eventually removed from Spratling's jurisdiction, and he had no further involvement in the case.  At the time he was mostly ignored by the press, and remains one of the less well-known inspectors involved in the case.  In 1894 he was transferred to Purfleet. He retired in March of 1897, at the age of 57.<br/> <br/>He had a wife named Emma, with whom he had two children, one of whom survived to adulthood. He died c. 1934 at the age of about 94. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Robert Anderson was born in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55907\" href=\"/ireland/4020-55907/\" slug=\"ireland\">Ireland</a>, the son of a Crown Solicitor. As a youth he became an apprentice in a brewery, but decided the business was not for him and left after eighteen months. He studied briefly in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56052\" href=\"/paris/4020-56052/\" slug=\"paris\">Paris</a> before entering Trinity College, Dublin. There he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1862. In 1863 he was called to the Bar in Ireland. He received his Bachelor of Laws, again from Trinity, in 1875.  <br/><h2>Character Evolution  </h2>In 1865 he became involved in the investigation into the Fenian terrorism that was active in Ireland and <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\" href=\"/england/4020-55794/\" slug=\"england\">England</a> at that time, eventually becoming the foremost expert both on their activities and on operations conducted against them. Because of this he was summoned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> in 1868 after the murder of a police officer by Fenians and subsequent jailbreak attempts. At this time he became advisor on political crime for the Home Office. During his time there Fenian raids began to slow down, and he was appointed secretary for governmental inquiries to justify his salary, most notably in 1877 when he became secretary for the Prison Commission. When Fenian activities were again stepped up in the 1880s, Anderson had to resign from the Home Office in 1884 after failed attempts to stop the bombing campaign that had begun in 1883. In 1886 he was again forced to resign, this time from the Prison Commission. <br/> <br/>In 1887 he was again appointed to the Home Office in his old position, and was assigned to assist Assistant Commissioner (Crime) <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62959\" href=\"/james-monro/4005-62959/\" slug=\"james-monro\">James Monro</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56630\" href=\"/scotland-yard/4060-56630/\" slug=\"scotland-yard\">Scotland Yard</a> with political crimes. In 1888, when Monro was appointed Commissioner, Anderson was promoted to his old position of Assistant Commissioner. When he was appointed the investigation into the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> murders was just getting underway. Almost as soon as he had been appointed he took an extended vacation to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\" href=\"/france/4020-55778/\" slug=\"france\">France</a>, only returning a month later when he was recalled due to the increasingly poor publicity that was being garnered by the police handling of the case. In the press Anderson stated several times that the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a> murderer had been caught, claiming that the culprit was a Polish Jew who had been imprisoned in an asylum. Presumably he referred to Aaron Kosminski. In 1896 he was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath, and in 1901 he was created Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. That same year he retired from Scotland Yard<br/><h3>Personal Life, Death </h3>Anderson married Lady Agnes Alexandrina Moore in 1873. Together they had five children. He died on November 15th, 1918 of Spanish Influenza. He was 77 years old.   <br/><h2>In Other Media  </h2>In <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\"><i>From Hell</i></a> Anderson was depicted as a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-51206\" href=\"/freemasons/4060-51206/\" slug=\"freemasons\">Freemason</a>, and the reason for him taking his extended invitation was given as his reluctance to participate in the cover-up that was taking place within the police in regards to the Ripper murders. There is no known evidence of Anderson being a Freemason. He also appeared in the novel <i>To Kingdom Come</i> by Will Thomas.",

    "description": "<p>George Godley was born in Sussex in 1857. In his early life he worked as a sawyer. In February of 1877 he joined the Metropolitan Police. By 1888 he had achieved the rank of Sergeant, and was assigned to J division. During the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> murders he was transferred to H division, which covered <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a>, in order to aid Inspector <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62781\" href=\"/frederick-george-abberline/4005-62781/\" slug=\"frederick-george-abberline\">Frederick Abberline</a> in the search for the Ripper. Their efforts ultimately proved fruitless, and eventually the case was closed and Godley moved on to other cases. Godley was the officer who, in 1903, arrested serial poisoner George Chapman, who was Abberline's prime suspect for the Ripper. In January of 1908 Godley retired; he had achieved the rank of inspector in K division. He died on July 20th, 1941 at the age of 84.  <br/> <br/>Godley has occasionally appeared in Ripper-centric media, such as the late-1980s miniseries <i>Jack the Ripper</i> in which he was played by Lewis Collins. A character was based on him in the <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\">From Hell</a></i> graphic novel, and later in the <a data-ref-id=\"4025-173\" href=\"/from-hell/4025-173/\" slug=\"from-hell\">movie adaptation</a>, where he was inexplicably called Peter Godley, and played by Robbie Coltrane.  </p>",

    "deck": "The Coroner who conducted the inquests into most of the Whitechapel Murders",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Wynne Edwin Baxter was born in 1844 to a printer. He was first educated at Lewes Old Grammar School, before studying law. He became a solicitor in 1867. He became Junior Headborough for Lewes in 1867, Vice-President of the Provincial Newspaper Society between 1871 and 1877, Under-Sheriff of London and Middlesex between 1876 to 1879 and again between 1885 and 1888, Junior High Constable in 1878 and Senior High Constable in 1880, and the Mayor of Lewes in 1881. He was also a member of the Law Association, the Law Society and the Solicitor's Benevolent Association. His longest-held position was as solicitor for the Lewes Cooperative Benefit Building Society, which he held for 50 years between 1870 and 1920.  <br/> <br/>By 1875 he had moved from Lewes to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> and set up a law office and an advertising agency, while still maintaining a law office at Lewes. In 1880 he was elected Coroner for Sussex, a position which he held until 1887. The most notable case he presided over at that time was that of Percy Lefroy Mapleton, the so-called \"railway murderer\", as well as that of Mapleton's victim, Isaac Frederick Gold. In 1885 he held two Deputy Coronerships for London and Southwark, and in 1886 he fought for and received the position of Coroner for Middlesex (Eastern District). In 1887 he conducted the inquest into the murder of Israel Lipski by poisoner Miriam Angel. <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Whitechapel Murders</h3>Baxter's most famous cases were doubtlessly the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a> Murders, which occurred in East London between April of 1888 and February of 1891, and claimed the lives of eleven women. Baxter conducted the inquests into nine of the murders, including three of the five canonical victims of infamous killer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a>. The Ripper victims that he investigated were <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62795\" href=\"/mary-ann-nichols/4005-62795/\" slug=\"mary-ann-nichols\">Polly Nichols</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62794\" href=\"/annie-chapman/4005-62794/\" slug=\"annie-chapman\">Annie Chapman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62791\" href=\"/elizabeth-stride/4005-62791/\" slug=\"elizabeth-stride\">Elizabeth Stride</a>. He was noted by contemporary press and police officers as having a particularly blunt questioning style.  <br/> <br/>Baxter personally believed that the murderer was committing his crimes in order to obtain female organs in order to sell them to doctors. He also believed that the murderer had some sort of anatomical knowledge. Soon after he suggested this theory of the organ seller, however, it was disproved. <br/><h3>After the Murders </h3>In 1889 he received the position of Coroner of Middlesex (South Eastern District) which he held until 1891. Also in 1889 he was appointed a Life Governor of London Hospital, and a year later conducted the inquest into the death of the hospital's most famous patient, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62787\" href=\"/joseph-merrick/4005-62787/\" slug=\"joseph-merrick\">Joseph Merrick</a>, the so-called \"Elephant Man\" He received the Coronership for the City of London from 1892 until his death. Throughout the 1890s he was involved in the translations of several texts from French, a language in which he was fluent, to English.

    "description": "<p>Emily Holland was born c. 1858. She shared a room with murder victim <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62795\" href=\"/mary-ann-nichols/4005-62795/\" slug=\"mary-ann-nichols\">Mary Ann Nichols</a>, along with four other women, at Wilmott's Lodging House in Thrawl Street. She had been watching a fire at the docks until about 2:30 on the morning of August 31st, 1888. As she was returning home she encountered Nichols at Osborn Street and <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a> Road. Nichols, who appeared noticeably drunk, informed Holland that she had earned her doss money at least three times that night, but each time had drunk it away. She seemed confident in her ability to make the money again, and refused to go along to the lodging house where the two shared a room, intending to first earn her money. This was the last time that Nichols was seen alive; she was found dead a little over an hour later at 3:40. Holland was able to identify the body.  <br/> <br/>In October of 1888 Holland was twice brought before the Thames Magistrate Court on charges of being drunk and disorderly, and was convicted both times. Nothing else is known about her.   </p>",

    "description": "<p>William Nichols was a printer. He married <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62795\" href=\"/mary-ann-nichols/4005-62795/\" slug=\"mary-ann-nichols\">Mary Ann Nichols</a> in 1864. They had five children together, the last of whom was born in 1879, but the marriage was an unhappy one and had dissolved by 1881. The reasons for this dissolution is unclear. Nichols himself suggested that it was because of his wife's dissolute ways, while her father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62808\" href=\"/edward-walker/4005-62808/\" slug=\"edward-walker\">Edward Walker</a>, said that it was because Nichols had engaged in an affair with the midwife who had delivered his last child. Nichols denied these allegations. One of the children, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62809\" href=\"/edward-john-nichols/4005-62809/\" slug=\"edward-john-nichols\">Edward Nichols</a>, sided with his mother and moved in with his grandfather. The other children remained in the care of their father. Nichols supported Mary Ann with court-mandated payments until 1882, when he claimed that she had begun engaging in prostitution and thus he had no legal obligation to continue supporting her.  <br/> <br/>When she was murdered at the end of August of 1888 he went to the morgue to identify her body. When he viewed it he reportedly forgave her for the wrongs she had done him in her life. He attended her funeral. No other documentation exists on his life</p>",

He was estranged from his father after his parents separated, which occurred in 1880 or 1881, when Edward was 14 or 15. He went to live with his maternal grandfather, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62808\" href=\"/edward-walker/4005-62808/\" slug=\"edward-walker\">Edward Walker</a>. He became an engineer in the intervening years between this estrangement and his mother's death in 1888.  <br/> <br/>After his mother was murdered, the first victim of notorious serial killer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a>, he went along with his grandfather and father to identify the body. Though there is no indication that he and his mother had remained in contact during the seven or eight years after her separation from his father, he showed no sign of malice or anger towards his mother. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>William Thick was born on November 20th, 1845 in Salisbury, Wiltshire. On March 6th, 1868 he joined the Metropolitan Police at the age of 22. He began in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a>, before being transferred to Chelsea, the Camberwell, and finally Whitechapel again. He remained in Whitechapel for the rest of his career. He was involved in the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> investigations in 1888. At some point he encountered <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62941\" href=\"/john-pizer/4005-62941/\" slug=\"john-pizer\">John Pizer</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55922\" href=\"/poland/4020-55922/\" slug=\"poland\">Polish</a> Jew living in Whitechapel, who he later suspected to be Jack the Ripper. While it was alleged that Pizer had carried out a series of minor assaults on prostitutes, and had been convicted on a stabbing offence, there was no evidence against Pizer and he was ultimately released after it was ascertained he had alibis for two of the murders. Pizer later suggested that Thick had borne a grudge against him, and this grudge was the reason he was suspected. Thick's nickname was \"Johnny Upright\", the reason for which was usually given as his upright bearing, but was suggested by at least one criminal to be because of Thick's habit of framing people. He was described by a police contemporary as an excellent policeman. In 1893 he retired from the police force. In 1902 he gave a tour around <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> to Jack London, who was writing a book about the East End called <i>People of the Abyss</i>. Thick died in 1930 at the age of 85.  <br/> <br/>Thick appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's</a> <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\">From Hell</a></i>, where he was portrayed as being fixated on Leather Apron and was implied to have earned his nickname for the less savoury of the two reasons presented. ",

His wife, Miriam Allison, to whom he had been married for around 19 years, left him some time in late August because of his drinking habits and abusiveness. On September 6th, 1888 he attacked his estranged wife with a hatchet on Ranelagh Road, Pimlico at the factory where she worked. His wife sustained serious wounds to her head, face and hands, and several other lacerations and bruises. Many of the blows were struck with the blunt side of the hatchet. He was stopped from wounding her further by the intervention of bystanders, and the hatchet broke. He claimed to be drunk at the time of the attack and to remember little of the events. On October 30th, 1888 he was indicted on charges of maliciously wounding with intent to murder, and sentenced to five years of penal servitude. His case was largely overshadowed by the hysteria surrounding the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> murders, which had been taking place at the time of his attack. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Almost forgotten today, his name having been co-opted by the member of a boy band, Nick Carter, “Master Detective,” was at one time the most famous mystery fiction character in America.</p><p>First appearing on September 18th, 1886 in the pages of a Street &amp; Smith serial chapter novel (what they had before pulps), a year before the first Sherlock Holmes story.</p><p>Nick Carter was young, strong, somewhat short, only 5 foot 4, dedicated to clean living, confident, a master of disguise, true, loyal, steadfast, and the possessor of the sharpest mind in New York.</p><p>After that first appearance the character would appear in over 1,500 dime novels (which for the record only cost a nickel) between 1886, and 1922.</p><p>After that Carter was later revived, and toughened up for the Pulp magazines of the 30’s, stared in an early film, got a radio show, and naturally in the 1940s became a comic book character.</p><p>Appearing first in Street &amp; Smith’s Army &amp; Navy Comics, he was then transferred to the comic of fellow S &amp; S detective The Shadow where he appeared until S &amp; S left the comics business in the early 1950s.</p><p>Nick appeared a few more times after that on television, and as a “master spy” in paperback originals that started in 1966 and ran until 1990 with 261 novels, however he has yet to make it back into comic book form.</p>",

The news goes on to say that Cooper attempted to steal a florin from Harry, and that Chapman drew his attention to it. This is given as the cause of the fight that the two women engaged in at the time. There is no evidence either for or against this being the cause of events.   </p>",

    "description": "<p>Eliza Cooper was born c. 1849. She was married to John William Cooper, a carman. She was possibly a prostitute, though in newspaper reports her profession was given as \"vendor of stationary.\" She lived at Crossingham's Lodging House and was an acquaintance of murder victim <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62794\" href=\"/annie-chapman/4005-62794/\" slug=\"annie-chapman\">Annie Chapman</a>. In the days leading up to the murder the two women quarreled for reasons that have never been satisfactorily determined. Cooper herself suggested it was because the deceased had borrowed soap from her and refused to return it. The majority of the fight was apparently carried out in The Britannia, a pub, and witnesses testified that Cooper struck Chapman in the face and chest, leaving the deceased with a black eye. Others have suggested the fight was over money being stolen, or the fact that both women were allegedly engaged in an affair with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62820\" href=\"/edward-stanley/4005-62820/\" slug=\"edward-stanley\">Edward Stanley</a>. It is unknown which version is true. This fight was the last time Cooper saw Chapman alive.   <br/> <br/>On October 17th she was arrested for assaulting a man named Thomas Wilne, and was bound for 5 pounds should she break the peace again. The reason for this assault is unknown. Early in the morning on November 6th she ran from her house on Worship Street and reported to a police officer that she had been stabbed by her husband. In all she had received three stab wounds. She was attended by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62946\" href=\"/george-bagster-phillips/4005-62946/\" slug=\"george-bagster-phillips\">Dr Bagster Phillips</a>. Her husband was arrested and held for trial. Nothing else is known about Eliza Cooper. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>Catherine Eddowes was the daughter of a tinplate worker. She lived in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> in her youth, but returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56690\" href=\"/wolverhampton/4020-56690/\" slug=\"wolverhampton\">Wolverhampton</a>, the town where she was born, to seek employment. When she lost her job there she became involved with an ex-soldier, Thomas Conway, with whom she had three children. She left the family sometime around 1880 after taking to heavy drinking, and moved to a lodging house. There she met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62950\" href=\"/john-kelly/4005-62950/\" slug=\"john-kelly\">John Kelly</a>, a fruit seller with whom she would begin a relationship. Her daughter, Annie, got married around this point and made a great deal of effort to avoid her mother's attempts to scrounge off of her. During the season Eddowes and Kelly took work as hop pickers in Kent, returning to London on September 28th. She took a bed in a casual ward and met up with Kelly again the next day, telling him that she intended go get money from her daughter.   <br/> <br/>Like the other victims of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a>, Eddowes was known to be a casual prostitute, but unlike them she was not known to be engaging in such behaviour around the time of her murder. However, since she was so low on money at the time of her death, the chances that she solicited trade the night of her murder are fairly high.     <h2>Major Story Arcs</h2>Catherine Eddowes was murdered on September 30th. At about 8:30 p.m. the night before she was found collapsed, drunk, on Aldgate High Street. She was brought by the police officers who found her to Bishopsgate station, where she gave the name \"Nothing\". She was placed into a cell, and checked on every half hour. She spent most of this time asleep, and was noted by wardens as smelling strongly of drink. She was released at 12:55, when it was determined that she was sober enough to take care of herself. As she left the jail she gave her name as Mary Ann Kelly, living at 6 Fashion Street. Rather than heading home, which she had implied to one of the wardens was her destination, she turned towards Aldgate again. She was not seen again for another thirty minutes until she was observed by three men to be standing in Church Passage, a walk that should have taken her only ten minutes from the police station. She was observed to be talking to a man. Her body was discovered at approximately 1:45 in Mitre Square. Her throat had been slit and her torso cut open. Her intestines had been removed and draped over one shoulder, with a two-foot section placed between her body and left arm. Her left kidney had been removed. She suffered extensive mutilation of her abdomen and thighs. As well, her face was severely mutilated, with the tip of her nose completely cut off. Part of one ear had been cut off as well. Catherine was buried on October 8th, 1888. <br/> <br/>One of the Jack the Ripper letters, the \"From Hell\" letter, was sent to George Lusk and was accompanied by half of a kidney which was claimed by the letter to belong to Eddowes. It is unknown if the kidney was actually hers, though it was suggested by contemporaries that it had come from a sufferer of Bright's disease, which Eddowes was. Other contemporary sources argue the kidney would have been easy to obtain for any medical student. Nobody knows for sure if the kidney was in fact Catherine's",

    "description": "<p>Edward Stanley was a bricklayer who lived at 1 Osborne Place, Brick Lane in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a>. It was rumored that he was an ex-soldier, and that he drew a pension from the Essex Regiment, hence his nickname, \"The Pensioner.\" This was later proven to be false by his own testimony.  <br/> <br/>He had known <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62794\" href=\"/annie-chapman/4005-62794/\" slug=\"annie-chapman\">Annie Chapman</a> for about two years before her death, and occasionally paid for her bed at Crossingham's Lodging House, as well as for the bed of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62818\" href=\"/eliza-cooper/4005-62818/\" slug=\"eliza-cooper\">Eliza Cooper</a>, an acquaintance of Chapman. It was suggested that he was involved in affairs with both women and that he was the cause of their altercation, though there is no substantiation for this. Just before Chapman's murder on the 8th of September, Stanley volunteered at Fort Elson, Gosport. He last saw Chapman the day after his voluntary service ended, on September 2nd. He estimated the time of their encounter as being between 1 and 3 p.m. He testified that she was wearing two rings and had a fading black eye, the remnant of a fight with Cooper. On the day of the murder he went to Chapman's boarding house to determine the veracity of rumours that she had been murdered. After Chapman's murder he tried to have as little to do with her as possible.  <br/> <br/>He was asked to testify at Chapman's inquest in the hopes that he might shed some light on the envelope found near her body which bore the mark of the Sussex Regiment. He was unable to do so, and the envelope was later found to be incidental to the murder. No other documentation exists about his life. </p>",

He claimed responsibility for the \"Dear Boss\" letter, the first to be considered by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56630\" href=\"/scotland-yard/4060-56630/\" slug=\"scotland-yard\">Scotland Yard</a> as anything other than a hoax, after its claim that the next victim would have her ear cut off was partially realized in the death and subsequent mutilation of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62819\" href=\"/catherine-eddowes/4005-62819/\" slug=\"catherine-eddowes\">Catherine Eddowes</a>. This letter was also the first to use the name \"Jack the Ripper\", which has since become the most recognized name for the killer. <br/> <br/>Best apparently confessed to being the original author of this letter in 1931. He claimed that he had written it in order to maintain interest in the case and sell more newspapers. This confession was not revealed until 1966, when <i>Crime and Detection</i> identified him as the self-confessed author of the letter, as well as a number of other letters that were published in the contemporary press. There is no substantiation for his claim, nor is there evidence against it.  <br/> <br/>Best appeared as the author of the \"Dear Boss\" letter in <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25755\" href=\"/eddie-campbell/4040-25755/\" slug=\"eddie-campbell\">Eddie Campbell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\" href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" slug=\"alan-moore\">Alan Moore's</a> <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-19109\" href=\"/from-hell/4050-19109/\" slug=\"from-hell\">From Hell</a></i>, where he was portrayed as an enterprising reporter who wrote the letter and created the Ripper name in order to stir interest in the case. </p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muscle</a> man (literally) for the crime lord known as Rapaz. He is silent and loyal to his boss. He is first introduced holding down a drug addict who squealed on Rapaz to Lt. Kellaway. Later, Walter intervenes when a man pulls a gun on Rapaz. However, the man reveals himself to be Lt. Kellaway as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42252\" href=\"/the-mask/4005-42252/\" slug=\"the-mask\">The Mask</a> (or Big Head as the comics called him.) Walter engaged Big Head in combat, causing the living cartoon character to feel pain for the first time. However, Big Head was able to supposedly kill Walter by sticking electrical circuits from a broken lamp post into his mouth.</p><p>However, it is later revealed that Walter is alive and well. He attacked and killed another crime boss who had put a contract out on Walter on the belief that Walter had betrayed them. After killing the mobster, Walter allowed himself to be arrested. He was eventually released thanks to corrupt District <a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow\">Attorney</a>, Steve Lister.</p><p>Walter has come to clash with several wearers of The Mask and still manages to remain standing. This alone makes him a deadly force. One time, Walter himself got The Mask, but it wasn't able to fit his head.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Walter has no actual super powers. However, he doesn't really need any. His massive size and endurance makes him virtually indestructible. He has been shot, beaten, electrocuted, and possibly anything else in the book. Yet he still stands. Not only that, but his colossal strength is one of the few things that can actually cause pain to whoever wears The Mask. This makes Walter one of the few remaining foes of Big Head.</p>",

When Kal-L's Father, a renowned scientist named Jor-L, discovered that their homeworld of <a href=\"/krypton/4020-30670/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-30670\">Krypton</a> was about to explode he desperately attempted to convince his fellow <a href=\"/kryptonians/4060-45710/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45710\">Kryptonians</a> of the danger their people was facing but they refused to believe him. Nevertheless <a href=\"/jor-l/4005-63062/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63062\">Jor-L</a> built a starship for his infant son Kal-L and though it pained both Jor-L and his wife Lora to send their only child away they both knew it was for the best. Shortly after his rocket was launched into space, Krypton exploded killing Jor-L and Lora and sent a \"meteor shower\" of irradiated chunks of the Krypton flying across the Universe.</p><p>Most of which traveled alongside Kal-L's ship before it inevitably came to crash in a cornfield near <a href=\"/smallville/4020-55733/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55733\">Smallville</a>, Kansas during World War I where the infant Kal-L, who had miraculously survived both the destruction of Krypton, the hazards of outer space and exposure to the large chunks of irradiated \"Kryptonite\" which joined his ship on it's journey to Earth, was found by <a href=\"/jonathan-kent/4005-3617/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3617\">John</a> and <a href=\"/martha-kent/4005-3618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3618\">Mary</a> Kent who had been passing by when <a href=\"/kal-els-spaceship/4055-56618/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56618\">Kal-L's ship</a> crashed to Earth.</p><p>Taking Kal-L in as their own, he was given the name Clark Kent and was raised on the Kent Farm for years without even knowing of his true origins until one day he began to slowly discover that he had extraordinary superhuman abilities that defied all the laws of physics but still remained unaware of his Kryptonian origins. In time John and Mary passed away and Clark decided to use his newly-found powers for the good of the world. He moved to the city of <a href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis</a> in order to properly start his career as a superhero as well as becoming a reporter for Metropolis' local newspaper: The <a href=\"/daily-star/4060-56299/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56299\">Daily Star</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Near the end of the Golden Age of Comics, the superhero genre declined in popularity and DC only continued to publish their most popular characters. However, in the early 60s, when superheroes began to become more popular, DC decided to integrate their Golden Age heroes back into continuity. To do this, the company introduced the concept of a parallel universe called Earth-Two, where many of the Golden Age characters lived, while the Silver Age stories would be established as having happened on Earth-One. This allowed characters like Alan Scot, Jay Garrick and Black Canary (along with many others) to interact with more modern characters.</p><p>However, since DC had continually published <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> stories since 1938, it was not originally clear whether the Man of Steel's Golden Age stories were intended to have taken place on Earth-1 or Earth-2 (this is also true for Batman and Wonder Woman, DC's two other characters whose continuity was not broken during the 1950s). During a Justice League/Justice Society team-up, a continuity error arose which established Superman as having been a member of <a href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\">the Justice Society of America</a> (which only existed on Earth-Two at the time) while also being a member of <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">the Justice League of America</a> (the Silver Age reboot of the JSA (which at the time only existed on Earth-One.)</p><p>DC would rectify this mistake in 1969 by establishing that there were two versions of Superman, in <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america-star-light-star-bright-death-star-i-see-tonight/4000-10337/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-10337\">Justice League of America #73</a>. Eventually a few minor changes were made to distinguish the two Supermen from one another. The Earth-2 Superman was named \"Kal-L\" (rather than <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Kal-El</a>, which would go to Earth-One's Superman) and was raised by John and Mary Kent. His \"S-Shield\" chest symbol was also adjusted to differentiate it from Earth-One's Superman Finally, Kal-L was given gray hair at the temples in order to make him look older than his Earth-One counterpart.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-737651\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/737651-earth_2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/737651-earth_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-737651\"><img alt=\"Kal-L and Lois were married following his return from fighting in World War Two\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/737651-earth_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/737651-earth_2.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></a><figcaption>Kal-L and Lois were married following his return from fighting in World War Two</figcaption></figure><p>DC Comics then decided to continue Kal-L's continuity as if it had continued that found in the Golden Age. During the Bronze Age of Comics Kal-L eventually revealed his true identity to his one true love, <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a> following his involvement in World War Two (despite the fact that the stories were published during the Bronze Age, they were set during the 1950s in order to keep the flow of time on Earth-Two a naturally progressive one) and the two got married. From there DC centered Kal-L's stories around his and Lois' early life as a married couple as well as showing Kal-L becoming more confident in his abilities, thus resulting in his ascension to Metropolis' one and only protector.</p><p>As his confidence grew more and more Kal-L eventually began expanding his horizons and grew from just being the protector of just Metropolis to being a protector of Earth itself. It was also revealed that Kal-L had been a founding member of The Justice Society of America but was given Honorary Member status, as he hardly ever participated in their adventures. Kal-L also built a secret citadel in the mountains near Metropolis that was somewhat similar to <a href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41185\">The Fortress of Solitude</a> on Earth-One. One major turning point in Kal-L's life was the discovery of more living Kryptonians.</p><p>The first encounter being with three brothers named U-Ban, Kizo and Mala who had once been a part of The Kryptonian Science Council until they attempted to conquer the planet which resulted in them being placed in suspended animation and being exiled from Krypton. Mala would go on to create a counterfeit Earth which is where <a href=\"/bizarro/4005-8312/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8312\">Bizarro</a> would emerge from in the future. The second encountered revolved around the discovery of Kal-L's cousin Kara (who would one day become <a href=\"/power-girl/4005-4915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4915\">Power Girl</a>) who had arrived on Earth-Two decades after Kal-L did and had been educated by her ship through a virtual reality simulation.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Crisis on Infinite Earths</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1174929\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174929-scan0001.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4\" data-width=\"625\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 625px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174929-scan0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1174929\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px\" data-width=\"685\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174929-scan0001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174929-scan0001.jpg 625w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174929-scan0001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174929-scan0001.jpg 625w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px\" data-width=\"685\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In 1985, DC Comics began to realize that there were way too many alternate versions of Earth and it's Heroes which was naturally causing great confusion amongst fans. DC Comics decided to destroy The Multiverse in the <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a> maxi-series which redefined the word \"retcon\" forever. A being of immeasurable power called <a href=\"/anti-monitor/4005-12165/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12165\">The Anti-Monitor</a> came from a realm called The Anti-Matter Universe. He began a genocidal sojourn across the Multiverse in an insane quest to make his Universe the only Universe so that he could truly become the Ruler of all Creation.</p><p>The Anti-Monitor destroyed almost every single Universe (including Earth-Six, Earth-Three and Earth-Prime)</p><p>save for five alternate worlds (the Silver Age/Bronze Age Earth-One, the Golden Age Earth-Two, the Marvel Family's Earth-S or <a href=\"/billy-batson/4005-2350/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2350\">Shazam</a>, the <a href=\"/charlton/4010-125/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-125\">Charlton</a> heroes' Earth-Four and the <a href=\"/freedom-fighters/4060-40383/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40383\">Freedom Fighters</a>' Earth-X) that were contained in a netherverse created by the death of the <a href=\"/the-monitor/4005-31018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31018\">Monitor</a>. The heroes of the DC Universe learned that to save these five realities they had to attack the Anti-Monitor at the Dawn of Time before he could change the course of history. The heroes went to the Dawn of Time to attack the Anti-Monitor but failed to defeat him. Instead the Anti-Monitor captured the heroes and absorbed their energies to give him the power to re-create the universe at the Dawn of Time in his own image.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1174931\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174931-scan0002.jpg\" data-ratio=\"2.15\" data-width=\"440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:215.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174931-scan0002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1174931\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-width=\"440\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174931-scan0002.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174931-scan0002.jpg 440w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174931-scan0002.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1174931-scan0002.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-width=\"440\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Victory and creation literally in his grasp, the Anti-Monitor suddenly felt an opposing, nearly omnipotent force resist him from the god-like entity known as the <a href=\"/spectre/4005-2361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2361\">Spectre</a>. The Anti-Monitor and the Spectre, fueled by the power of DC's greatest sorcerers and mystics, were locked in a power struggle over the fate of the universe. The clash of power and energies between these two cosmic beings climaxed in an energy backlash that essentially became The Big Bang and a universe was born and only one universe. As a result of the battle with the Anti-Monitor at the Dawn of Time, the multiverse never came into being and the universe was reborn combined with different aspects from the five surviving realities.</p><p>Most of the heroes from the five earths then existed on this New Earth while some others never existed at all. For example, most of the <a href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\">Justice Society of America</a> existed as heroes of World War II with the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League of America</a> continuing their legacy. Heroes such as Earth-Two's <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> and <a href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\">Robin</a>, the <a href=\"/helena-wayne/4005-45563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45563\">Huntress</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> and Kal-L ceased to be in this new timeline. Heroes such as Kal-L were still in this new universe because they were at the Dawn of Time before the rebirth of the new universe. Also, all the heroes at the Dawn of Time were the only beings to remember the events of the Crisis.</p><p>The Anti-Monitor continued to be a powerful threat when he shifted the New Earth from the positive matter universe and into the anti-matter universe. The heroes regrouped once again and formulated an intricate plan designed to destroy the Anti-Monitor. When the heroes thought the Anti-Monitor was dead, <a href=\"/alex-luthor/4005-24087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24087\">Alexander Luthor</a> of Earth-Three used much of the anti-matter energy that he drained from the Anti-Monitor to create a portal to transport the New Earth and the heroes back to the positive matter universe. However, the Anti-Monitor was not dead and he attacked the remaining heroes leaving through the portal. The Silver Age <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> of Earth-One was reduced to her original clay form by the Anti-Monitor's energy blast.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1179051\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1179051-scan0078.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4946619217082\" data-width=\"562\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 562px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1179051-scan0078.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1179051\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px\" data-width=\"642\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1179051-scan0078.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1179051-scan0078.jpg 562w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1179051-scan0078.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1179051-scan0078.jpg 562w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px\" data-width=\"642\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Kal-L stayed behind in the anti-matter universe to fight the Anti-Monitor and forced the remaining heroes (the Bronze Age <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> of Earth-One, <a href=\"/lady-quark/4005-30757/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30757\">Lady Quark</a> of Earth-Six and the Superboy of Earth-Prime) to leave through the portal back to the positive matter universe. <a href=\"/superman-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\">Superboy-Prime</a> decided to stay behind as well to help Kal-L in this final battle with the Anti-Monitor. Alexander Luthor of Earth-Three had to remain to close the portal in the anti-matter universe. Kal-L delivered the final, killing blow to the Anti-Monitor and saved the reborn universe. In the end however their victory felt bittersweet, while Alexander teleported the other heroes back to the New Earth, Kal-L, Alexander and Superboy-Prime were trapped in the anti-matter universe.</p><p>Shockwaves from the explosive death of the Anti-Monitor was disintegrating everything in its path. Alexander soon revealed that he not only had secured a new home for them but had also saved Kal-L's wife, the Lois Lane of Earth-Two, shortly before it was erased from existence.

Kal-L became obsessed with making sure that Lois stayed healthy and alive, Superboy-Prime would not stop watching the \"recorded\" events of his entire life even all the way up to it's destruction and Alexander Luthor came to the realization that he had made a grave error in judgment by bringing them to The Paradise Dimension.</p><p>Luthor learned that during The First Crisis, the villain known as <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a> was capable of watching everything through his eyes, when he was about to send Kal-L and the others to The Paradise Dimension he was able to see through Darkseid's eyes and watched as he said that Alex was essentially a conduit to all worlds. However Alex instantly forgot this and it became a sort of blip in the timeline, meaning that every time Alex reviewed New Earth's history that moment would not show up.</p><p>But eventually he unraveled the blip and learned that Alexander could have taken them to <a href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\">Apokolips</a>, which despite all of the dangers traveling through that world presented had a gateway that led back to Earth.

He would also cause the timeline to unravel and readjust itself as he did so and that is when Alex came up with a plan to escape their imprisonment.</p><p>Giving Prime a power boost using his own Anti-Matter abilities, Prime punched his way out of The Paradise Dimension and together with Alexander they secretly began work on the plot to create The Perfect Earth.

Kal-L became convinced of Luthor's lies and broke open a path out of The Paradise Dimension.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-782425\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/782425-death_of_earth_2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/782425-death_of_earth_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-782425\"><img alt=\"The Death of Lois Kent\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/782425-death_of_earth_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/782425-death_of_earth_2.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Death of Lois Kent\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/782425-death_of_earth_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/782425-death_of_earth_2.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Death of Lois Kent</figcaption></figure><p>The first thing Kal-L did upon breaking free was help Alexander and Prime partially rebuild his old citadel in the mountains near Metropolis so they could have a base of operations to work from. Once Lois was all situated, Kal-L sought out his cousin Kara (Power Girl) who had been integrated into the New Earth timeline following The First Crisis and brought her back to the citadel in order to restore her memories of Earth-Two, which he did when she touched Lois' hand.</p><p>Afterward Kal-L sought out <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> hoping that he would be able to convince him to aid in their cause as well. Things did not go as planned however and Kal-L sadly departed from the Batcave.</p><p>When he returned Alexander told him to stay remain with Lois which he did straight up to the very moment in which Alexander recreated The Multiverse which resulted in Kal-L and Lois being teleported to the sidewalk just outside the entrance to The Daily Star on the newly restored Earth-Two. For a moment everything seemed right and then the illness which had infected Lois for so long took her life and she died in Kal-L's arms.</p><p>Devastated, Kal-L screamed so loudly that he destroyed all of the windows around him, his screams were heard by the mainstream <a href=\"/dc-universe/4050-21352/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21352\">DC Universe</a> Superman who had also ended up on Earth-Two and came to see what was the problem.</p><p>When Kal-L learned of Superman's presence on Earth-Two he flew into a rage, believing that the \"corrupted\" Superman had killed Lois simply by being there and outright attacked him. Kal-L and Superman fought for a long period of time which resulted in almost the total destruction of Earth-Two's Metropolis, while fighting one another they saw each others lives through their eyes as well as the lives of other versions of themselves.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-109308\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/109308-11128-superman.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.49\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/109308-11128-superman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-109308\"><img alt=\"Kal-L vs. Kal-El\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/109308-11128-superman.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/109308-11128-superman.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kal-L vs. Kal-El\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/109308-11128-superman.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/109308-11128-superman.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kal-L vs. Kal-El</figcaption></figure><p>Their battle was finally ended by New Earth's <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> who intervened just in time and gave Superman the moments he needed to convince Kal-L that Alexander had been using him.

Kal-L was winning the fight and almost destroyed the device, but with a little delay thanks to Power Girl, the device was completed and activated. It ended up destroying all the nearby Black Lanterns, including Kal-L.</p><h2><b>Equipment</b></h2><h3><b>Costume</b></h3><p>Like every version of Superman, each have their own costume, though Kal-L's costume is similar to Kal El's, their were a few differences. Though Kal-L's costume wasn't used as much as Kal El's costume in the media. Though it was used, Kal-L's costume was used in the early Fleischer cartoons. Kal-L's costume next appeared in Super Friends, where the costume strongly resembled Kal-L's costume. Kal-L's costume last appeared in Justice League: The New Frontier. Kal-L's costume has changed over the years, in the early Golden Age Comics his S shield was just in a triangle, but later on it was changed to a diamond shield. Kal-L's costume also had a shorter cape than Kal El's cape. Kal-L continued to wear this costume up until his death.</p><h2><b>Powers and Abilities</b></h2><h3><b>Strength</b></h3><p>Kal-L possess Super Strength. The early portrayals of Kal-L show him to be stronger than a locomotive, but as time went by, Kal-L became much Stronger. Kal-L in his Prime could match the Silver Age Superman in strength, this was shown in the 1960s, however, in Infinite Crisis, he could only match New Earth Superman. Kal-L's powers were originally not solar based, however his powers were <a href=\"/retcon/4015-43566/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43566\">retconned</a> so that he did get his powers with The Sun, it was shown that his powers grew stronger with age up until a certain point. In Superman: Infinite Crisis, Kal-L was so powerful, that whenever he punched Kal-El, Kal-El would experience his life. Kal-L was shown to have the power of punching through reality, Kal-L and Kal-El were arguably the most powerful beings during the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.</p><h3><b>Speed</b></h3><p>Kal-L possess super speed, his early portrayals show him to be faster than a speeding bullet, but as time went by, he was capable of time traveling with his speed. Kal-L's speed can be compared to Kal-El's Speed.</p><h3><b>Flight</b></h3><p>Kal-L could not originally fly, he could only jump, but in the later incarnations he was capable of flying, and even flying in space. Also at very fast speeds.</p><h3><b>Microscopic Vision</b></h3><p>Kal-L like most other incarnations of Superman has the ability to see miniature objects. He used this power mostly in the Golden Age of Comics.</p><h3><b>Durability</b></h3><p>Kal-L possess super durability, he was capable of surviving a blast from the Anti Monitor, fighting Kal-El of the Silver Age, trading blows with Superboy Prime and fighting Kal-El of New Earth.</p><h3><b>Super Thinking</b></h3><p>Kal-L was capable of learning a language by just listening to it. This was shown in the Golden Age.</p><h3><b>Super Vision</b></h3><p>Kal-L is capable of seeing at long distances.</p><h3><b>Hypnotism</b></h3><p>Kal-L in the late Golden Age stories was capable of hypnotising people, however, he has never again used this ability, due to it being time consuming.</p><h3><b>X-Ray Vision</b></h3><p>Kal-L is capable of seeing through objects, except led.</p><h3><b>Super Breath</b></h3><p>Kal-L is capable of blowing powerful winds.</p><h3><b>Heat Vision</b></h3><p>Kal-L has Heat Vision, he gained this ability in the early cartoons.</p><p><b>Personality</b></p><p>Kal-L in the early Golden Age stories was violent and beat on criminals and had a loose moral code, and didn't mind killing. Though as time went by his personality was changed to a light-hearted man who helped people, and also had a strong moral code and swore never to kill, he made a promise that if he did kill, he would retire as Superman. Though he did not entirely stick to this promise, during the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, Kal-L finally crossed the line and delivered the final blow to the Anti-Monitor, killing him in the process. It was implied that in Superman: Infinite Crisis, Kal-L was more violent than Kal-El and didn't hold back as much.</p><h2><b>Statistics</b></h2><ul><li>Height: 6''2</li><li>Weight: 222lbs</li><li>Eyes: Blue</li><li>Hair: Black</li><li>Real name: Kal-L</li><li>Occupation: Reporter/Editor of the <a href=\"/daily-star/4060-56299/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56299\">Daily Star</a></li><li>Relatives: <a href=\"/jonathan-kent/4005-3617/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3617\">John</a> and <a href=\"/mary-kent/4005-19172/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19172\">Mary Kent</a></li><li>Base of operations: <a href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis</a></li></ul><h2>Other Media</h2><p><i>Note: Only depictions of Kal-L (not Superman) should appear here.

This version of similar is distinctly similar to the early portrayal of the Golden Age Superman. It is clearly set in the early 1940s, visually the Fleischer Superman looks similar to the early Golden Age Superman and Superman is portrayed as less of a boyscout and rougher.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Al Harper is a physicist and rock collector. He met the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\" href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" slug=\"silver-surfer\">Silver Surfer</a> when the Surfer fell from the sky. In an act of human kindness he took the Surfer to his home and let him recuperate. He learned of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\">Galactus</a>' barrier and offered to assist the Surfer in escaping Earth.<br/><br/>He created a suit that was powered by the Surfer himself. It was designed to disguise the Surfer's molecular structure and confuse the barrier. When the Surfer went to use it, he discovered the plot of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13332\" href=\"/stranger/4005-13332/\" slug=\"stranger\">Stranger </a>to destroy all life on Earth with a Null-Life Bomb. Al used a portable geiger scope to try to locate and defuse the bomb.<br/><br/>Little did Al know, the bomb had a defense mechanism. When he tampered with it it released a deadly gas. He was able to defuse it but not before it took his life. <br/><br/>The Surfer lit a flame as a tribute to Al at the cemetery that will burn as long as the Earth remains.<br/></p>",

    "description": "<p>Ron Evers grew up in <a href=\"/suicide-slums/4020-56534/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56534\">Suicide Slum</a>s and realized that people had to do amoral or illegal things just to survive. Ron was friends with <a href=\"/cyborg/4005-2388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2388\">Vic Stone</a>. Vic followed Ron wherever he went until Ron’s behavior grew worse. When Vic’s father Silas transformed him into a Cyborg, Ron began to wonder what became of his friend. Ron later finds out that Silas’ employers at <a href=\"/star-labs/4060-56686/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56686\">S.T.A.R Labs</a> are promoting Cyborg’s technological advancements for military applications. Ron decides to save his friend by rigging S.T.A.R. Labs to blow shy high. Cyborg appreciated Ron’s concern but he couldn’t allow Ron to hurt any innocent people. The two friends fight on the roof of S.T.A.R. Labs and Ron seemingly falls to his death. Cyborg then hurls the bomb into the air so the damage was minimal. </p><p>Technicians from S.T.A.R. Labs found Ron’s body and their robotics engineer<a href=\"/mr-orr/4005-46915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46915\"> Elias Orr</a> transformed Evers into another Cyborg similar to Vic Stone. Orr put Evers abilities to use in the Middle East. However, Ron still maintained his memories and he wanted revenge on those who made him a technological monster. Evers attacked Orr and S.T.A.R. Labs but this brought him into conflict with the Teen Titans. In the end, Vic rips Ron's cybernetic implants, rendering him immobile.</p><p>Vic did all he could to give Ron back some degree of humanity and now Evers looks a bit more human aside from the loss of his left eye. Evers then becomes a neophyte/ minister of a radical religious sect known as the Church of Anti-Technocracy. Ron preaches to his followers that they must denounce all technological advancements. Ron’s crusade again brought him into conflict with Cyborg but Ron confesses that their last battle had saved him spiritually as well as physically. Ron pleads with Vic to give up his dependency on technological enhancements but Cyborg tells Ron that there is a reason why he became Cyborg. The accident that transformed Vic gave him a purpose and that is to save the innocent. </p>",
