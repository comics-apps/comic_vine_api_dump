    "description": "<div><h2>History</h2></div>The Void Hound is a tremendously powerful AI hailing from the antimatter universe; it has served as the consciousness of a plethora of superweapons. Its intelligent, analytical mind can adapt to enemy combat styles and heavily upgrade existing technologies based upon memories and designs engraved in its memory. Originally the mind for a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41619\" href=\"/qward/4020-41619/\" slug=\"qward\">Qwardian</a> superweapon of the same name, it eventually was revealed to be much more than that. <br/><br/>Its origins involve a story similar to the normal Earth's history of the <span>Construct</span>: a consciousness born of countless computers interacting with each other. The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-39355\" href=\"/qwardians/4060-39355/\" slug=\"qwardians\">Qwardians</a> captured the intelligence and uploaded it into the operative system of the Void Hound, their top weapon. Constructed with nothing less than supreme power in mind, hearkening to their legends of Erdammeru, the malevolent god of destruction of the Qwardian pantheon, the station included squadrons of fighters, tesseract bombs capable of rendering whole solar systems uninhabitable, and weapons capable of destroying suns. Hidden for eons in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"/oa/4020-41360/\" slug=\"oa\">Oa'</a>s moon, the weapon was retrieved by a cadre on angry Qwardians, who wished to conquer the positive-matter universe because of the past losses and indignities Qward had suffered in its past. <br/><br/>However, the legends spoke of all who tried to commandeer the weapon as dying shortly of burnout, as they couldn't handle the strain of driving a weapon with such capabilities. The <span>Highlord of Qward</span> tried to do so, and was enthralled by the power of the Hound, soon losing his mind to the weapon and desiring none other thing than to destroy all of his enemies. When the superweapon headed to Earth, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\" href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" slug=\"john-stewart\">John Stewart</a> managed to absorb its consciousness into his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\" href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" slug=\"green-power-ring\">Green Lantern ring</a>, thereby ruining the warship. Millions of systemic failures cascaded as the machine died. Yet the Void Hound was not done.<br/><br/>Tired of its imprisonment within the ring, it began slowly consuming Stewart until it gained a measure of ascendancy above his mind and therefore the ring. Controlling the most powerful weapon in the universe, it began remaking Stewart to escape to true freedom, giving him the gifts of technopathy and cyberization as his mind was slowly overridden by the machine mind. Ultimately, in the modified world created by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6891\" href=\"/morgaine-le-fey/4005-6891/\" slug=\"morgaine-le-fey\">Morgaine Le Fey</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55658\" href=\"/enigma/4005-55658/\" slug=\"enigma\">Enigma</a>, the ring fell to the Hound's control, and Stewart could do nothing as the ring, with him along for the ride, took him to outer space, where the machine built a body for itself using Oan and Qwardian technologies--a true Hound of the Void.<br/><br/>It was found in this state by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27246\" href=\"/krona/4005-27246/\" slug=\"krona\">Krona</a>, who offered it the chance to become his personal warhound. Intrigued and surprised by the fact it was given choice, the Hound eagerly agreed to hunt for Krona, to kill entire solar systems and galaxies in its path. However, it became intrigued even more when the Nightlord, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" slug=\"batman\">Batman</a>'s divine form, offered him even more in exchange for participating in an assault against Krona. The warmech took its time and decided to take the offer as well, intrigued at the prospect of having an actual destiny beyond hunting for no reason. Its databanks and intelligence were thus infused with the soul of the daughter of the antimatter universe's Riddler, Stephanie Nashton. Guided by her hand, both now strive to make a difference in the antimatter Earth without resorting to the violent methods of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41531\" href=\"/crime-syndicate-of-amerika/4060-41531/\" slug=\"crime-syndicate-of-amerika\">Crime Syndicate</a>.<br/>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Donna is the only daughter of Geoff and Sylvia Noble, and granddaughter to Wilfred Mott. She was always bossy and fiercely independent, and slightly mischievous, she used to boss her parents and family around when she was young, and on her first day of school she was sent home for biting. Aged six years old Donna's mother refused to take her on holiday, so she packed her bags and got onto a bus and headed to Strathclyde. Donna had missed out on previous alien invasions, on Christmas day with the Sycorax she was stuck in bed with a hangover and during the attack of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30950\" href=\"/cybermen/4005-30950/\" slug=\"cybermen\">Cybermen</a> she was in Spain scuba-diving, so her first contact with aliens was still rather shocking.</p><p>Her career seems to mainly consist of temp jobs, but she has previously worked in a library and two years at a double-glazing firm. In the June of 2007 Donna was faced with the most important choice of her life, even if she didn't know it, the fate of the universe rested on her shoulders as to whether or not she turned right and became a full-time secretary with Jival Chowdry or a temporary secretary at H.C Clement's, a security firm. She chose the latter, due to the fact she thought she'd meet a man and fall in love, which she did, because on her first day of work she met Lance Bennett, who after time she pressured into marriage. Whilst she was planning her marriage her beloved Lance was slipping huon particles into her coffee, under the command of the Empress of Racnoss, whom he was secretly serving.</p><h3>First Meeting With The Doctor</h3><p>Whilst walking down the aisle with her father, the huon particles inside of her interacted with her elevated mental state and managed to teleport her into the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55682\" href=\"/tardis/4055-55682/\" slug=\"tardis\">TARDIS</a>, moments after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-33354\" href=\"/the-doctor/4005-33354/\" slug=\"the-doctor\">The Doctor</a> had just said farewell to his beloved <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55700\" href=\"/rose-tyler/4005-55700/\" slug=\"rose-tyler\">Rose</a>. Both were flabbergasted by the event, Doctor not suspecting a bride to be teleported into his control room and Donna not expecting to be able to be teleported. Almost immediately she demanded to be taken back to her wedding ceremony in Chiswick. The Doctor tries to get her back but they end up near Oxford Street. When landed Donna storms from the TARDIS and goes straight for a public telephone to try and contact her family, whilst the Doctor tries to figure out how she got on board, when that fails she heads out into the road trying to get a taxi, but as she is in her wedding dress none want to lend a hand, though she eventually realises that she has no money. Trying to help solve the problem the doctor goes to an ATM to grab some cash, all during the time Donna borrowed some off a passerby and got in a cab. Leaving the Doctor to nearly be attacked, yet again, by robotic Santas.</p><p>Unknown to Donna the taxi driver is also a robotic Santa, however she quickly realises that the taxi is not heading for her wedding church and finds the doctor pursuing the cab in the TARDIS. The Doctor catches up and Donna is able to jump aboard from the car, though the strenuous event puts the TARDIS out of use for some time. The Doctor then gave Donna a ring which would stop the robot Santas tracking her and the two get chatting as the Doctor tries to learn more about Donna. Much to the relief of Lance, her family and friends, the Doctor manages to return Donna to the reception. The Doctor learns that the H.C. Clement's building is owned by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55717\" href=\"/torchwood/4060-55717/\" slug=\"torchwood\">Torchwood</a> Institute and, through examining the wedding photographer's footage that Donna was turned into huon particles (which haven't existed for billions of years).</p><p>They find that the reception hall is surrounded by robot Santas and that they had rigged a Christmas tree's ornaments to fly off at people and explode. Using the reception's sound system and his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55684\" href=\"/sonic-screwdriver/4055-55684/\" slug=\"sonic-screwdriver\">sonic screwdriver</a> the Doctor is able to shake the robots apart and trace their signal back to a star shaped ship hanging in the sky above but it shortly cuts off. So the Doctor asks Lance to take Donna and himself to the H.C. Clement's building, where they learn that the place had actually not been owned by Torchwood since Doomsday and that there is a basement level that's not on the floor plans. They find themselves in a long corridor which leads them to the Thames Barrier, where there is a laboratory in which huon particles are being made. This is when the Doctor deducts how Donna got on his ship and they find a huge laser dug hole spanning the room leading to the center of the Earth.</p><p>Whilst exploring the lab a half-humanoid, half-spider teleports into the room which Doctor immediately recognises as being a Racnoss, a race believed extinct about the same time as huon particles. The Racnoss identifies herself as the Empress who has, above the pit, fashioned a giant web, from which the body of H.C. Clement's still hangs, Lance sneaks behind the Empress with an axe and goes to strike only to reveal he has been working with her the whole time and was the one putting huon particles in Donna's coffee. So the Empress could use their power to regain her ancient power. Then as more robot Santas enter and take aim at the Doctor and Donna the TARDIS materializes around them allowing for their escape. Though the Racnoss queen is not thwarted as she knows how to achieve the same effect with Lance and she force feeds him huon particles as he's trapped in her web.</p><p>The Doctor decides to take Donna back to the creation of the Earth so they can see what is so important and find that a Racnoss ship is actually at the core of the Earth. Armed with the knowledge they return to the corridor and enter the lab only for Donna to get trapped in the web and Doctor held at gunpoint. The Empress activates the huon particles and awakes all of her species that had been trapped down in the Earths core, knowing they'll be hungry she drops Lance down the pit. Meanwhile the Empress' ship flies over london shotting things after originally being thought to be a Christmas star. The doctor manages to get back into the lab and gives the Empress one final offer to take her and her people far way where they are a threat to no one. She refuses and the doctor reveals himself to be Gallifreyan, a race which has already once defeated the Racnoss. Using explosive Christmas baubles he blows open the walls allowing water from the river Thames to flood in.</p><p>The Doctor doesn't move until Donna says he can stop. The two escape in the TARDIS and the Empress teleports back to her ship moments before t is blown out of the sky by tanks from orders of \" <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50781\" href=\"/master/4005-50781/\" slug=\"master\">Mr. Saxon</a>\". The Doctor returns Donna to her home, a desolate woman as she has lost her job and fiance in one day, to cheer her up the Doctor makes it snow and offers her to join him in the TARDIS but she declines and encourages him to find someone as she recognizes that he has just lost someone close and he briefly opens up to her about Rose before jumping in his TARDIS and disappearing, thought never to be seen again.</p><h3><span id=\"Literature\">Literature</span></h3><p>Outside of the television series, Donna appears in some of the BBC Books New Series Adventures novels, alongside the Tenth Doctor, in stories set in-between episodes of series four.</p>",

A man of many vices and many indiscretions, who nonetheless managed to increase the Hellsing Organization's influence beyond its primitive scope and allow for further expansion. Educated at Balliol College as a descendant of Abraham van Helsing, he was assigned a young butler who had also spent some time in that school: Walter C. Dornez. Arthur, during WWII, developed a severe case of borderline alcoholism and unquenchable lust for carnal pleasures, and with the influence he commanded, he very rarely denied himself these desires. Despite this, he held a firm hand upon the estate's resources, and was eventually entrusted with the family seat at the Convention of Twelve and the knowledge of the loyal Nosferatu sworn to obey his orders without question. Catankerous and outspoken, he never feared voicing his opinion without remorse or concern. His main friends, through all his life, were Sir Hugh Irons and Sir Shelby Penwood, both of who held similar chairs in the Convention of Twelve. Their group was thus a formidable power source in the British Empire of WWII.</p><p>Midway through WWII, Arthur and his friends started receiving accumulating rumors of horrors unspoken in a Polish camp where a mysterious Projekt, Order 666, had been issued. Words of secret experiments and undead monsters became serious enough to convince the trio to authorize the deployment of a higher class of weapon to combat the burgeoning threat: the Hellsing monster. Pairing him with Dornez, Arthur ensured the destruction of the camp though he was unaware of a mysterious circumstance, as of yet unrevealed, that allowed for the Projekt main three figures, the Major, the Captain and the Doctor, to survive the carnage virtually unscathed, a circumstance that had much to do with Walter. Some time later, he grew weary of Alucard, believing him too strong a weapon to be solely relied upon, and had him sealed and any records of his existence cloaked or destroyed to continue the Organization's work through more conventional soldiers. He retained Dornez as a butler and eventually promoted him to retainer of the family.</p><p>Eventually, he somehow found a woman who he found good enough to become his wife, and sired a single daughter, Integra. His brother Richard tolerated his excesses in the hopes of reaching the power Arthur enjoyed. His wife died before Integra was twelve, and eventually his lifestyle caught up with him and caused to start slipping into a deep sickness. He revealed to Integra in hushed tones about Alucard's existence and resting place, and tried to ensure his power was passed down to her. Richard found this unbearable and attempted to kill her only to set in motion the events that led to the genesis of the <i>Hellsing </i>manga.</p><p>By all means, Richard was not a perfect man. Obnoxious, drunk, loud and outspoken, not many liked the odd Hellsing heir. Even his close friend Sir Shelby Penwood would later admit to Integra he found himself occasionally fastidiated by Arthur's now and then over-the-top demands for weapons, alcohol and fun, and while Sir Hugh Irons recognized him as a great man, he also commented he had been a fool for trusting Walter, foreshadowing his role in the Final Night of London.</p>",

Soon after he married, a group of lawyers informed Abraham that he had inherited land from his family in a place called Wallachia. On the way to Romania, Van Helsing stopped to have a meeting with the lawyers in Bistritz. Elizabeth then went ahead to the manor to set it up for the night. One lawyer had a collection of Hun and Magyar artifacts that caught Abraham's attention. As he was studying them, he lost track of time.</p><h3>Finding Dracula</h3><p>Later on when he arrived to the manor, Elizabeth was nowhere to be found. As he looked for his wife, he found mutilated bodies with their necks bitten and the marking \"XXX\" burned into their flesh underneath their bitten necks.

This Dutch physician helped them defeat the <a href=\"/vampires/4015-55796/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55796\">vampire</a>, following the plot of the novel <i>Dracula</i> by Bram Stoker, sans Harker, up to the end; instead of outright killing the undead beast, Abraham instead chose to bind the demon to his will and that of his descendants. Whether he knew that this assured Mina would never heal from her vampirism is debatable. However, he went forth and forced the vampire to undergo varied modifications which he oversaw while he lived, modifications that would eventually lead to Dracula being fully bound to the line and becoming their faithful servant against the monsters he once belonged to. In addition to this, Abraham presumably oversaw the inhuman increase in power the vampire received upon his forced servitude, including the massive upgrades in regeneration and shadow control he displayed in his future fights against <a href=\"/millennium/4060-45562/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45562\">Millennium</a>.</p><p>Abraham Van Helsing, whose descendants would change surname to Hellsing and form the Hellsing Organization, was also presumably the first of the family to be awarded a seat at the Convention of Twelve. Nevertheless, his carelessness, or hubris, cost his family dearly; while <a href=\"/alucard/4005-44583/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44583\">Alucard</a> was in effect bound to the bloodline, his survival also allowed <a href=\"/wilhelmina-murray/4005-22206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22206\">Mina Harker</a> to continue struggling through undeath as for as long as the master vampire roamed the night, she would know no eternal rest. Thence, a <a href=\"/nazism/4060-52436/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52436\">Nazi</a> lunatic who ended up working for the secret Order 666 Projekt managed to dig up Mina's dessicated corpse, and use her undead systems to create the insane monster SHI, and the genesis of the Millennium Group, who would eventually end up brutally destroying <a href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\">London</a> with their Army of a Thousand Vampires.</p><p>Alucard apparently had a deep, grudging respect for Abraham; he would eventually end up partly patterning his own appearance after Abraham's, reflecting how highly he thought of the doctor who had manged to best him in combat and drive a stake through his heart. He also compared the Vatican's greatest Paladin, <a href=\"/father-alexander-anderson/4005-44693/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44693\">Alexander Anderson</a>, to him, favorably, believing earnestly Anderson's humanity and his own history with Abraham proved a human with a will powerful enough was capable of destroying monsters such as himself. Abraham was also the ancestor of future Hellsing Organization directors <a href=\"/arthur-hellsing/4005-62850/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62850\">Arthur Hellsing</a> and <a href=\"/integral-fairbrook-wingates-hellsing/4005-44614/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44614\">Integra Hellsing</a>, and of failed Hellsing candidate, <a href=\"/richard-hellsing/4005-62854/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62854\">Richard Hellsing</a>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

It is Arthur Hellsing who first makes good use on Penwood asking him for helicopters and new weapons. A silent and fearful man he is often looked down on and will always follow the crowd, When he was first introduced to integral he called her a little girl and was soon put in his place by the young Integral, Telling him that she is the head of this family and with a smile, told him that she would make the same demands of Penwood as her father had.</p><p>Years later during the invasion of London, we soon discover that a member of the inner cricle has betaryed the rest of them and become a vampire, he is soon dispatched by Walter and Sir Integra apologises to Penwood as she thought out of all of them he would betray them, He tell her he may be many things but a coward is not one of them. Integra leaves the command centre of London in his hands, knowing it will soon be over ran by the vampire armies, He orders his men to leave and go home but they ignore him and tell him to sit and allow them to get to work as he will only get in the way. His men are all killed and he is left alone to face a platoon of German vampires as they break into the command centre, He calls them fools and tries to press a button. The German commander shoots him four times and then screams for him to stop, Penwoods last words \"Sorry I can not oblige....Goodbye Integra.\" pressing the button lets the c4 round the building explode taking the German platoon with him as he dies. His courage and bravery shone over his incapability. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Sir Hugh Irons was one of the main Seated at the Convention of Twelve, along with fellow Knights Shelby Penwood (one of his oldest friends), Integra Hellsing (daughter of another of these friends, Arthur Hellsing), and another nine Knights sworn to serve the British Crown at all costs. He was a lifelong friend of Arthur Hellsing and Penwood, and all three were together a powerful force in England from their instatement as members of the Convention of Twelve. It was they who authorized the usage of a loyalist vampire to vanquish the Poland camp responsible for the Order 666 implementation. After the war, he seldom saw action, but retained a deep distrust of the agent paired with the vampire in the destruction of the Nazi camp, Walter C. Dornez; his suspicions were perhaps more than justified, seeing how the Major, the Captain and the Doctor all survived.<br/><br/>Much later in life, he was caught in a Convention of Twelve gathering at Hellsing Manor when the Millennium agents the Valentine Brothers attacked with an army of ghouls. When Jan Valentine reached the Convention boardroom, he was promptly shot at by all the members, Irons included. At the end, with the Hellsing ghouls lying in agony all over the place, he ordered Walter to ignore Integra's command to put down these ghouls and demanded Integra do it herself, to which she reluctantly complied, executing the ghouls with Irons' revolver.<br/><br/>He was also found outside of London upon the devastating Millennium attack, and approached a military detachment to inform himself of the situation in the city; he was thoroughly unsurprised reports indicated there was a possibility Integra held resistance within the city. Upon learning of Penwood's sacrifice and heroism, he praised him, though he still thought he was a tad incompetent. He also commented on how he had seen Walter's changes in behavior and strongly suspected him of collaborating with Millennium ever since he went to Warsaw in 1944.<br/></p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>The so-called \"Demon Baby\" was summoned by Lawrence (a man who'd been cast out of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\" href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\">     Hand</a> and who was a practitioner of ancient ritualistic rites) in order to give it to Jonathan Powers (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-13979\" href=\"/jester/4005-13979/\">    the Jester</a>) for a power boost. When the Jester was defeated by<a data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\" href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\">    Daredevil</a>, the Demon Baby began possessing various people, inspiring them to violence, and so that it could make its way back to the man who'd summoned it. <br /><h2>Creation </h2>The Demon Baby was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40435\" href=\"/brian-michael-bendis/4040-40435/\">  Brian Michael Bendis</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3122\" href=\"/alex-maleev/4040-3122/\"> Alex Maleev</a>. <br /><h2>Major Story Arcs <br /></h2><h3>Decalogue</h3>After the Jester was possessed by the Demon Baby, he attacked a bank in broad daylight and took several hostages. Daredevil came to the rescue and fought the Jester until he suddenly vomited up the Demon Baby due to the pain. The Demon Baby attempted to possess a teenage girl, but Daredevil swatted it away and it escaped to find a new host. <br />Attempting to return to Lawrence, the man who'd summoned it, the Demon Baby possessed various innocent people and forced them to commit murder and other atrocious acts.  <br />Eventually the Demon Baby made its way back to Lawrence and possessed him. In an attempt to gain power over it, Lawrence went to a local church support group, only to find that many of the people attending it where those who'd been indirectly affected by the Demon Baby's horrors. As the people started sharing their stories, they became increasingly curious over the significance of the demonic baby that seemed to be present in many of their stories. The Demon Baby slowly began gaining further influence over Lawrence, causing him to become increasingly abrasive and accosting towards the other people. <br />However, when it was revealed that Daredevil was also attending the meeting in order to try and piece together the events of the last few weeks involving the Demon Baby, Lawrence panicked and ran for it. Lawrence grabbed a gun and a sword to defend himself, but when Daredevil confronted him, he began to vomit up the Demon Baby. Before Daredevil could help him unfortunately, Lawrence took his gun and blew his own brains out, killing both himself and the Demon Baby.<br /><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>The Demon Baby was able to possess the bodies of human beings and was able to grant them superhuman strength, endurance, and agility, as well as the ability to fire green energy from their eyes. Once the host body had experienced a certain amount of stress, the Demon Baby would be vomited up and it would immediately seek out a new host. The Demon Baby subtly influenced its victims in order to drive them to become more violent and murderous.",

To prove his worth he will attempt fights that he is outmatched.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><ul><li><b>Allegiance: </b>Decepticon</li><li><strong>Sub Group</strong>: Constructicon</li><li><strong>Function:</strong> Hauler/Transport</li><li><strong>Alt-Modes:</strong> Komatsu HD465-7 articulated dump truck</li><li><b>Color Schemes:</b> Purple (G1, IDW), Red (Film), Green (Toys)</li></ul><h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>In Other Media</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2><h3>Film</h3><h4>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2765988-overload__rotf_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2765988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.66911764705882\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2765988-overload__rotf_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2765988\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117127/2765988-overload__rotf_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2765988-overload__rotf_.jpg 680w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117127/2765988-overload__rotf_.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117127/2765988-overload__rotf_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>During the battle in Egypt between the <a href=\"/autobots/4060-40489/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40489\">Autobots</a> and <a href=\"/the-fallen/4005-58724/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58724\">The Fallen</a>'s Decepticons, Overload arrived in a quarry with the other Constructicons before merging into Devastator to attack former <a href=\"/sector-seven/4060-55725/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55725\">Sector Seven</a> agent <a href=\"/reginald-simmons/4005-58951/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58951\">Seymour Simmons</a>, <a href=\"/leo-ponce-de-leon-spitz/4005-62573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62573\">Leo Spitz</a>, <a href=\"/skids/4005-48567/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48567\">Skids</a> and <a href=\"/mudflap/4005-62544/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62544\">Mudflap</a>.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Rampage appeared in <a href=\"/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen/4025-67/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-67\">Transformers Revenge of the Fallen</a> Movie. Rampage's alt-mode is a Bulldozer. He is one of the <a href=\"/decepticons/4060-40490/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40490\">Decepticons</a> known as the <a href=\"/constructicons/4060-41858/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41858\">Constructicons</a> and forms the left arm of the <a href=\"/ultracons/4060-57003/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57003\">Ultracon</a> <a href=\"/devastator/4005-11891/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11891\">Devastator</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Rampage was created for the 2009 <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen/4025-67/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-67\">Transformers Revenge of the Fallen</a> Movie. He is based on the original Contructicon <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bonecrusher/4005-41864/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41864\">Bonecrusher</a> <i>(who was only in some Toy versions of Devastator and did not appear as a Constructicon in the Movie).</i> He was created due to Bonecrusher being used a as a different character in the first film.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>IDW Publishing</h3><h4>Tales of the Fallen</h4><p>Rampage's body type was one of the early \"construction drones\" used to build Star Harvesters. One of them joined <a href=\"/the-fallen/4005-58724/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58724\">the Fallen</a>'s original Decepticons. He tried to battle the turncoat <a href=\"/jetfire/4005-41909/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41909\">Jetfire</a> and was quickly taken out.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Weaknesses</h2><p>In vehicular mode, Rampage can exert a force of 800,000 psi at a speed of 30 mph. He can knock down all but the most reinforced structures. His thick titanium-steel armor makes him virtually invulnerable. While in his alt-mode he can use a short-range concussion bomb launcher. In robot mode he can combine his legs into a powerful jackhammer. He serves as the left arm when combined to form Devestator. Rampage's eagerness to cause destruction often results in the loss of property the Decepticons can use.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Tanya is a <a href=\"/edenia/4020-57418/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57418\">Edenian</a> brought up in <a href=\"/outworld/4020-55787/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55787\">Outworld</a> well known for being traitorous, her attraction to forbidden magics has drawn her into the service of the fallen elder god <a href=\"/shinnok/4005-53469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53469\">Shinnok</a>, aswell as the sorceror <a href=\"/shang-tsung/4005-15541/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15541\">Shang Tsung</a> and the necromancer <a href=\"/quan-chi/4005-53257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53257\">Quan-chi</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Deception</h2><p>After the Netherrealm war, Tanya stood with Quan Chi to act as an enforcer (or ambassador) for the Deadly Alliance he maintained with Shang Tsung. However, after they were ambushed by the ressurected Dragon King Onaga and seemingly killed by Raiden's sacrifice, Tanya was leaderless and wandered back to Edenia. Baraka and his Tarkatan minions ambushed her and offered two choices - to serve Onaga or to die. After pledging her services to Onaga, she took him to the realm of Edenia, where she thought she could find an ancient spell to fuse the six Kamidogu amulets into one, granting the owner of such item overwhelming power.</p><p>In her Deception ending, she was able to find the spell, which has allowed Onaga to fuse the amulets. But Tanya was able to betray Onaga at the last moment, killing him and snatching his item, so she could have the power for herself.</p><p> </p><h2>Mortal Kombat X</h2><p>Tanya appears for the first time in the alternative timeline, in Kotal Kahn's chapter from Mortal Kombat X's Story Mode. She appears among the insurgence team leaded by Mileena. When Kotal defeats and is about to kill Kano, Tanya ambushes him. He then remembers her as the one who freed Mileena, and Tanya reminds him she did so because Mileena vowed to do something he refused to do: free the realm of Edenia. Kotal responds that Outworld stays united against its enemies, but Tanya refutes that it'll never be united under his rule. They engage in kombat, and Kotal wins, calling Tanya a fool for trusting Mileena.</p><p>Tanya appears later in the game's story when D'vorah's chapter kicks in. When D'vorah and Cassie Cage go check out the base of Mileena's rebellion, they find out Rain, who gets to engage D'vorah in kombat while Tanya ambushes Cassie. Once Cassie gets knocked-out by Tanya, her attention turns into D'vorah, who was trying to enter the tent where the amulet was hided. Tanya stops her and mocks about their species. D'vorah only says that their species do prefer solitude... something that she would recover momentarily. After defeating Tanya, D'vorah was about to slay both Rain and Tanya, who were inconscious at the moment, but Cassie stops her and reminds her of the mission at hands. Tanya's whereabouts after that event are unknown.</p><p>In her Arcade Ladder ending, after the abrupt end of Mileena's insurgency, her allies have scattered; among them, there was Tanya and Rain. Even though Rain has become a powerful ally and a satisfactory consort, she concluded his usefulness has worn off. In exchange for leniency, Tanya informed Kotal Kahn of Rain's whereabouts. He was then executed, and Tanya was imprisioned, but alive. And so, Tanya's plotting began anew.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Tanya debuted in the fourth Mortal Kombat game and is named after the creator Ed Boon's sister Tania.</p>",

Kano had proposed to reform the Black Dragon clan, but in reality merely wished to use them to slow down any Special Forces agents who may have followed him. Jarek was stationed as head of security at a downtown office which the clan was using as a front for their activities. While there, he was confronted by Major Jackson Briggs on the building's helipad. Jarek was soon defeated and brought back into custody.</p><p>Shortly before the events of <i>Mortal Kombat 4</i>, Jarek was able to escape to Edenia after learning of Kano's apparent death. Now thought to be the last surviving member of the Black Dragon, he was pursued by Sonya Blade and Jax who were seeking to destroy the last remnants of the clan forever. However, seeing that all of humanity was faced the threat of Shinnok's invasion during this period, they decided to focus their attention on the new threat, and Jarek agreed to help his sworn enemies defeat this common foe. After the destruction of Shinnok's forces, he resisted allowing himself to be turned over to the Special Forces. The encounter concluded with Jarek running off to Sonya and trying to throw Her from the cliff but Sonya managed to evade Him, with Jarek's aparent death in the process. <i>Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</i> reveals that he survived this brush with death by driving his weapon into the ravine side, slowing down his fall enough so that he only ended up gravely injured. Using his presumed demise as a cover, Jarek went into hiding and began to master new fatality techniques in order to exact revenge on his adversaries. However, he became frustrated with the difficulties that his injuries befell him, and soon he wished to do nothing more than to kill everyone. Quan Chi found Jarek and promised him that, in return for aiding the side of the Forces of Darkness, the sorcerer would give him the ability to enhance the strength and capabilities of his fatalities, and he would be given a chance to challenge all of his foes at once. Jarek agreed and headed into Edenia to take part in the final battle.</p><p>In Jarek's <i>Armageddon</i> ending, he defeats Blaze, and the chi from all the other warriors begins to flow through the firespawn and funnel into him. He starts to feel as if Death itself were guiding his actions. Sealing off the crater, Jarek begins to perform the other fighters' own signature fatalities on them, eventually finishing them all.</p><p>Biographys</p><ul><li><b>Mortal Kombat 4:</b> <i>\"Believed to be the last member of Kano's klan, the Black Dragon, , Jarek is hunted down by Special Forces agent Sonya Blade for crimes against humanity. With the emergence of a much greater evil, Sonya focuses her strength on the new menacing Quan Chi. Jarek now finds himself fighting alongside Sonya and Earth's warriors to help defeat the evil Elder God, Shinnok.\"</i></li><li><b>Armageddon Bio Kard:</b> \"Long thought to be the last remaining member of the Black Dragon, Jarek had served as Kano's second-in-command. After his master's apparent death, Jarek fled to Edenia. Shinnok's attempt to take control of the realms seemed to leave him no other choice, and so Jarek joined forces with his sworn enemies, Sonya Blade and Jackson Briggs.\"</li></ul><ul><li><b>Armageddon:</b> <i>\"What was done to me by the Special Forces could only be described as brutality. But that's fine. I can take it. What angered me was that somehow Jax found me. I'd covered my trail, kept to the shadows. But still I was routed out. Jax dropped me into a ravine, assuming that would be the end of me. It would have been if I hadn't thrust my weapon into the cliff wall to slow my descent. I was badly injured, so I went into hiding. My rumored death would be the ultimate camouflage as I regained my strength. Obsessed with thoughts of revenge, I traveled all over the realms looking for ancient texts that would show me a fatality worthy of my betrayer. But my injuries made perfecting these new techniques a very painful task. My frustration turned into rage and I no longer cared who had s</i><i>old me out. I would kill them all - a sentiment Quan Chi apparently shared. Quan Chi recognized the carnage I had left behind as I practiced my new fatalities on the good people of the realms. He was impressed and offered to help me increase their power and effectiveness. All I needed do was fight beside the Forces of Darkness in Edenia. The means of enhancing my fatalities would reveal itself, and all my enemies would be there for the slaughter. Soon I'll have revenge. The time will come to finish them all.\"</i></li></ul>",

    "deck": "Reiko, once a general for both the evil Shao Kahn and Shinnok is a mysterious warrior. Not much is known about this warrior other than his lust for blood which ended horribly for him.",
    "description": "<h2>Origins</h2><p>Reiko was first introduced in Mortal Kombat 4 as a mysterious warrior with a strong lust for power. He appears as a muscular caucasian male, with a facial tattoo and white eyes without pupils. He once served as <a href=\"/shinnok/4005-53469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53469\">Shinnok</a>'s general and was a member of the Brotherhood of the Shadow, a group that worshiped the fallen Elder God. When Shinnok was defeated and banished by <a href=\"/raiden/4005-49423/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49423\">Raiden</a>, he was believed to have died in battle and disappeared. He later reappeared, becoming <a href=\"/shao-kahn/4005-49430/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49430\">Shao Kahn</a>'s top general. Apparently, his skills in battle were legendary and his ruthlessness earned him Shao Kahn's favor. Considered a genius by his enemies, Reiko would still be fooled by his own hubris in the end.</p><h3>Reiko's Role-Play</h3><p>Reiko is arguably the biggest creep in the MK franchise, as he appears to have a perverse obsession with Shao Kahn. In Mortal Kombat Deception's Konquest mode, the <a href=\"/shujinko/4005-65511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65511\">player</a> finds out during a side quest that Reiko would borrow Shao Kahn's helmet without his permission, sneak into Kahn's throne room when it was empty and would wear his helmet for hours. Apparently, he would pretend to be Shao Kahn in some sort of power fantasy scenario when he thought no one was around to see. Shao Kahn eventually caught onto Reiko's bizarre behavior however, as he came to the realization that one of his own men was taking his mask behind his back. Only his right-hand man had access to his helmet...</p><p>While Shujinko was on a quest in Outworld, he runs into the emperor himself. The two clearly were not allies, and Shujinko was not welcome in Kahn's presence. Shujinko thought he would have to then fight for his life, but the mighty emperor had a much simpler solution. He ordered the traveler to perform an easy task for him. He sent Shujinko to deliver a possible warning to Reiko, if it was indeed him that has been stealing his personal item. Sure enough, Reiko was caught in the act by Jinko, and the news was returned to Kahn.</p><p>Shao Kahn was appalled with Reiko, and told Shujinko that Reiko would surely be executed if he did anything like this ever again. If Reiko's skills were not so valuable, Kahn definitely would have disemboweled the deviant.</p><p>If Shujinko again confronts Reiko after this event, Reiko will appear humiliated, embarrassed and depressed. No longer allowed to wander Kahn's palace without <a href=\"/tarkatan/4060-58434/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58434\">Tarkatan</a> supervision, Reiko curses Shujinko, claiming that he will one day be the supreme ruler of Outworld, and no one would be able to stop him then.</p><p> </p><h2>Appearance</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1194602-mka_koncept_reiko_tmk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1194602\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75817923186344\" data-width=\"703\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 703px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1194602-mka_koncept_reiko_tmk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1194602\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1194602-mka_koncept_reiko_tmk.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1194602-mka_koncept_reiko_tmk.jpg 703w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1194602-mka_koncept_reiko_tmk.jpg 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1194602-mka_koncept_reiko_tmk.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><ul><li>Age - Unknown</li><li>Height -6' 3''</li><li>Weight -199 lbs</li><li>Species - Outworlder</li><li>Alignment - Evil</li><li>Origin - Outworld</li><li>Resides - Outworld</li></ul><h2>Mortal Kombat X</h2><p>In the alternative timeline, Reiko appears as a main antagonist in the comic prequel to Mortal Kombat X. Just like in the original timeline, he was a renowned general in Shao Kahn's forces, and was shaped by the emperor himself as a potential heir. In one of his campaigns, Reiko conquered a kingdom whose temple's goddess has shared a prophecy to him: \"Reiko's blood reigns\".</p><p>However, he wasn't counting with Quan Chi, who manipulated and deceived Shao Kahn - who would end up dying - in the name of the Brotherhood of Shadows. As he lost hope in succeding Shao Kahn, he contemplated suicide as a better option compared with being enslaved by the now freed Elder God Shinnok. When he was about to end it all, he is found by the cleric of Chaos, Havik. Havik said that he was in search of the one from the prophecy and said that his blood would indeed reign, but first, it had to run, as he stabbed Reiko with a Kamidogu dagger.</p><p>Later, he would act as a general in Mileena's forces, as well as being her lover. Reiko had a pivotal role in a significant victory against Kotal Kahn's forces, where Goro himself would erradicate the emperor's own father at his own hands. However, when Goro failed to deal with Kotal himself, he and Havik concluded that part of Kotal's newfound power was due to the Blood Magik brought by the Kamidogu dagger from Outworld, which made Reiko become more decided about becoming the new Blood God. For his next step, he went to Jax's farm, who was keeping the Kamidogu of Earthrealm, and gave him an offer: the dagger for the life of Jacqui, who was under Havik's captivity along with Cassie at the time. After an one-sided battle between them, Jax only complied when Reiko threatened to kill his wife as well. Much later, he resumes the process to turn into the Blood God, by stabbing himself with two Kamidogu daggers.</p><p>Eventually, when Kotal's forces, along with Sonya Blade and Johnny Cage, arrive at Shang Tsung's Island, Reiko and his forces - consisted of Red Dragon, Skarlet and mind-controlled Cassie Cage and Jacqui Briggs - would receive them, and then the battle took off. Eventually Mileena's forces would join the party, fighting side by side with Kotal's forces against the threat of Reiko. Reiko rips D'vorah in half with his new found strength. Proud that he is stronger than the mighty Shao Kahn himself, Reiko is so sure of himself in this moment that he is the greatest warrior to ever live.</p><p>This joy is short lived however, as this spells the beginning of the end for the deviant known only as Reiko. Ermac summons Shao Kahn's Wrath Hammer, and gives it to Mileena. Sneaking behind the fool, she caves his head in with the mighty hammer. Reiko's brains went everywhere and his eyeball popped out of his socket, his skull was completely broken and he died on impact. However, it wouldn't take long to see that the Blood Code's influence on Reiko was strong enough to make him regenerate him and bring him back to life. This would not be beneficial for long. To make things worse, the might of the alliance between Kotal, Mileena and Ermac would result in an even more painful death for the imbecile. Kotal Kahn would gut Reiko with a dagger, causing his entrails to spill out and Reiko to cry out in pain and terror, Mileena then would break his legs off causing another yelp of agony from Reiko, and just as he thought that was the end of it, Ermac used his telekenis on his head, tearing it off of his body with his magic and resulting in the screaming evil man dying once more. Reiko was now nothing more than a mutilated corpse, but Havik came along with a mind-controlled Raiden, who electrocuted every opponent in the battlefield.</p><p>After the battle, Havik announced that he would repair Reiko's remains via Shang Tsung's Flesh Pits. His body would be regenerated, and Reiko would be resurrected a final time to claim his throne. There, the transition to Blood God could be resumed. Reiko claims that he has died enough for one day, and is ready to live a life of godhood now. He first drank from the goblet of the champions' blood (the champions being Johnny, Sonya, Kotal, Mileena, and Ermac). Then, he is brutally stabbed by the remaining Kamidogu daggers, as Havik declared that Reiko's blood reigns. Shortly after that, he demands sacifices in his name, but as he is unable to feed himself with the champions, Havik instead asks for the remaining soldiers from the battle to be brought for the sacrifice. As Reiko kills and devours every single one of them, he asks for more people to sacrifice. As Havik says that there is none left, Reiko begins to feel the hunger stinging and clawing from within, which causes his bones to rip through his flesh and tear his own body apart. In the midst of his agony, Reiko's face begins to melt, and the supposed 'god' can only scream because of his excruciating pain. It is then revealed by Havik that godhood was not Reiko's to claim, and that he was instead just a pawn in Havik's invocation of the real god. He then diggs his thumbs into Reiko's eye sockets and rips open Reiko's head with his own hands holding his brain for all to see. Havik then pops Reiko's brain and Shinnok's amulet was revealed to be hidden inside his pineal gland all along. Reiko is no more.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111247507/5564075-9447261510-mfbng.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5564075\" data-ratio=\"0.55094991364421\" data-width=\"1158\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1158px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.1%\" href=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111247507/5564075-9447261510-mfbng.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5564075\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247507/5564075-9447261510-mfbng.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247507/5564075-9447261510-mfbng.jpg 1158w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111247507/5564075-9447261510-mfbng.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247507/5564075-9447261510-mfbng.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p> </p>",

    "deck": "Jodo Kast was a bounty hunter who used his Mandalorian Armor to make a name for himself and was often mistaken for Boba fett which he used as an advantage during his short lived career. ",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Jodo Kast was once apart of the spec ops branch of the rebellion when it was very isolated. He was not very interested in the ideals of the republic, but rather the credits to be made from the conflict. During one battle he killed a Mandalorian named Feskitt Bobb, who was working for the empire. Bobb was mistaken for Boba fett initially and that paved the way for his next move. Jodo Kast recovered <a data-ref-id=\"4055-53506\" href=\"/mandalorian-battle-armor/4055-53506/\" slug=\"mandalorian-battle-armor\">Mandalorian Armor</a> very similar to that worn by Boba Fett on the planet Zaadja. The armor was heavily modified to look as close to Boba Fett's infamous armor as possible. After a while he would modify his armor again to obtain a more unique appearance.</p><p>He was inexperienced and survived most missions by luck and the protection his armor afforded. Kast had started out with two partners in bounty hunting and usually took all the credit for their kills. He began getting bigger and better bounties because of his armor and was a more affordable option than Boba Fett. The Empire often hired him and so did the Black Sun criminal empire on occasion. Before being called by the Empire he was hunting the Aqualish pirate Ponda Baba.</p><p>Often he was mistaken for Fett and he used that to get larger bounties until he came across Dengar who knew he was not the legendary bounty hunter. After being alerted by Dengar, Fett came to reclaim his honor and shut down his impostor. Fett hired Kast and had several traps set to test him and his abilities. Jodo Kast saw that he was set up once he saw the famed bounty hunter awaiting him. The battle was brief and Jodo's inexperience and lack of skill would cost him his life. While immobilized, his jet pack was rigged to blow. Unable to reach it in time he met his unfortunate end.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Mandalorian Armor complete with a jet pack, flamethrower, grapple hook, and poison darts (both lethal and non lethal).</p><p>Blastech J3-E left handed blaster rifle (modified to look like Boba Fett's rifle).</p><p>Stun Collar</p><p>Foxcatch - A modified Lamda Class shuttle loaded with weapons.</p><h3>Other Media</h3><p>Jodo Kast is a main character in the role playing game Tatooine Manhunt which was published by West End Games in June of 1988. He is one of the few characters with no alliances to any others.</p><p>Jodo Kast appears in the Star Wars themed fighting game Star Wars: Masters of Teras Kasi (1997) for the Playstation. He is an unlockable character who's canon in the story is debatable. His in game voice was provided by Neil Ross.</p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-size:18pt; \"><h2>Background</h2></span></b></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12pt; \"><span>Nathan Explosion was born and raised in New Port Richey, Florida by his overbearing mother and father, Rose and Oscar Explosion. When his family first appeared in the series his mother constantly rambled to him to his annoyance. Nathan has shown a strong hatred for his mother because of said short comings. On the other hand Nathan has once stated that his relationship with his father is much better and that he enjoys drinking and hunting with him though Oscar himself wishes that Nathan was never born, considering his upbringing a waist of his \"beer money\". <br/> <br/> Ironically Nathan did not speak a word till the age of five. When he had won his second grade class president election a drunk driver crashed into his class killing everyone but himself yet the entire time Nathan did not say a single word and was not in the least bit shaken. Nathan was a failure as a student, only excelling at football and dissecting frogs. Nathan never graduated high school; instead he dropped out to become a vocalist and eventually joined Dethklok.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-size:18pt; \"><h2>Personality</h2></span></b></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12pt; \"><span>Nathan Explosion is considered to have a similar psychological profile to that of Joseph Stalin. As a member of Dethklok Nathan has very little compassion and holds no value towards human life. According to himself he feels only hatred and anger. The only people Nathan genuinely cares about are his band mates and CFO. He has child like tendencies like being easily jealous, annoyed and has tantrums just like the rest of his band mates. Nathan loves violence and all things brutal which he uses as inspiration for his over the top violent lyrics.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-size:18pt; \"><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2></span></b></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12pt; \"><span>Nathan is relatively strong for a human, being capable of lifting heavy furniture by himself. He also has an incredibly high pain tolerance, breaking his face through glass without showing any signs of pain and quikly recovering after being kicked in the testicles by an Amazon. Nathan also knows how to use a gun and has some fighting skills. <br/> <br/> Being a part of Dethklok makes Nathan insanely rich; Dethklok is currently the world’s seventh largest economy. He and his band mates use billions of dollars every day on meaningless things yet they still earn more than they can waist. Dethklok has used their money to gain more protection then the pentagon, one of the world’s largest army, hundreds of dedicated slaves, flying bio domes, giant hovering concert stages and ect.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-size:18pt; \"><h2>Quotes</h2></span></b></p> <span>\"Price check! Clean up aisle 6, rotten body landslide!\"<br/> \"We are here to make coffee metal. We will make everything metal. Blacker than the blackest black times infinity.\"<br/> \"Whoah! That's a good song title.\"<br/> \"The fact that my parents had sex to create me makes me want to be buried alive.\"<br/> \"Mur... murder... a guy, a guy gets murdered... aaand eaten... at an all-you-can-eat buffet, yeah... OH! and that happens forever! Yeah! <br/> \"I need a hundred beers. Exactly... Exactly one hundred beers, thank you.\" <br/> \"Huh. I can't believe we summoned a troll. Why didn't we think of this earlier?\" <br/> \"Release the kitties!\" <br/> \"Were in a horrible depression, and i got to admit; were startin' to like it!\"<br/> \"Pickles is right. We have a tough choice. Playing acoustic is totally lame and not metal. But then again if we don't put that troll back to sleep, we may never be able to check our email with high speed dsl again.\"<br/> \"Two cups on rice.....brutal.\"<br/> \"We got you your favorite thing...disappointment!\"<br/> \"You're all going to die! You're going to die! You're going to die! You're going to die! And especially you, you're going to die! No matter what you say, no matter what you do, you're all going to die!\"<br/> \"Your music sucks and you're an asshole! I'm, I'm having a hard time expressing myself.\"<br/> \"Maybe you're right.

    "description": "<h2>Powers and Abilities</h2> Asgardians possess the standard physical attributes of an Asgardian Male: Superhuman strength enabling him to lift at least 30 tons Asgardian Females 25 tons, superhuman speed far superior to that of the finest human athlete, stamina enabling them to perform at their absolute peak for at least 24 hours before even starting to tire, superhuman reflexes greater than a human's, superhuman durability that allows them to withstand powerful impact forces, extreme temperatures and pressures, falls from great heights, energy blasts and high caliber bullets without sustaining injury; and finally, Asgardians's agility is also superhuman. Asgardians also possess a regenerative healing factor, being capable of healing from injuries such as slashes and puncture wounds in a matter of hours, and mending broken bone within the day. They can't however, regenarate missing limbs or organs without magical assistance. The Gods of Asgard are also granted certain mystical abilities that in the past have shown to get them the power to change their appearance, transform matter and wield a numerous amount of different energies. Though many Asgardian Gods/Goddess' have not shown the ability to wield any type of energy or shown any mystic abilities these powers are inherent to all of their race. Like standard conventional Asgardian gods",

It believed that the Eternals' protective dome was destroyed, and it was the fault of bankers of Earth who stalled him when they denied his request for a loan to purchase medical supplies for his father.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Thelius was created (first named The Crusader) by George Pérez and Roy Thomas and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four-164-the-crusader-syndrome/4000-15780/\">Fantastic Four vol.1 issue 164 </a>(1974).</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Becoming the Crusader</h3><figure style=\"width: 573px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3204267\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3204267-atlas00201.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.0174520069808\" data-width=\"573\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3204267-atlas00201.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3204267\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3204267-atlas00201.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3204267-atlas00201.jpg 573w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px\" data-width=\"629\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After being awakened from the Uranian dome, Thelius rushed back to Earth to exact revenge on the ones he thought where responsible for the destruction of his home. He eventually arrived on earth and started calling himself <i>The Crusader. </i>He then began a rampage in New York City. Armed with was later found to be the \"<a href=\"/quantum-bands/4055-42361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42361\">Quantum Bands</a>\", he faced the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>. He lashed out in rage and nearly defeated them, but in his madness the bands found him to be unworthy and disintegrated him slowly, leaving just the Quantum Bands behind. These would be retrieved by <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a>, and given to SHIELD, where they would later be passed down to <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Wendell Vaughn</a>, the hero would take the name Marvel Boy and then Quasar.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Restruction</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Thelius was recreated (along with three former bearers of the Quantum Bands) by <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> to destroy Quasar at the funeral of one of his oldest enemies, <a href=\"/eon/4005-13348/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13348\">Eon</a>. Thanos promised the \"<a href=\"/quantum-banders/4060-56265/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56265\">Quantum Banders</a>\" that the last one of them standing after they killed Quasar would be Thanos' <a href=\"/protector-of-the-universe/4015-55736/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55736\">Protector of the Universe</a> for all time. After a fiece struggle, Quasar managed to destroy the other members of the Quantum Banders within the <a href=\"/quantum-zone/4020-44748/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44748\">Quantum-Zone</a> and left Thelius alive but trapped within the Eonverse.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Later, Thanos contacted Thelius and freed him from the Eonverse after Quasar had died and named Thelius his new protector. Thelius attempted to co-opt Quasar life on Earth even going so far to try to \"team-up\" with the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> and to join the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>. After Quasar managed to resurrect himself (with the help of the <a href=\"/star-brand/4055-43199/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-43199\">Starbrand</a>), he trapped Thelius within the <a href=\"/white-room/4020-53683/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-53683\">White Room</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Powers and Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Thelius wielded the Quantum-Bands for decades until he died abusing their power against the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>. When he was later resurrected by an <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a> empowered Thanos, he created a set of perfect replicas of the Quantum-bands for Thelius and the other <a href=\"/quantum-banders/4060-56265/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56265\">Quantum-Banders</a>.</p><ul><li>Energy Manipulation:</li></ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Primarily, the bands are tools for manipulating forms of energy. A bearer of the quantum-bands can affect, alter, absorb, and channel any form of energy found in the Electromagnetic spectrum, from Gamma Rays to Radio Waves, and this also includes visible light.</p><ul><li><b>Energy Constructs:</b> The bands can construct anything the wearer can imagine from \"Quantum energy\", This energy is derived from the Quantum-Zone, although the bands can absorb energy from all known sources.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Flight:</b> The bands allow the bearer to fly in atmosphere or in space (surrounding the wearer in an energy aura to protect from air-friction or the vacuum of space), and can achieve incredible speeds (Wendell Vaughn once flew from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> Harbor to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-moon/4020-42072/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42072\">Sea of Tranquility</a> in under 5 minutes). <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a> was often clocked at near light-speed. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starhawk/4005-2168/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2168\">Starhawk</a> was estimated at traveling at \"thrice light-speed\" by Era, Eon's child in an alternate future.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Teleportation:</b> they also enable the bearer to quantum jump or create apertures between the fabric of space/time of various sizes. Allowing the wearer access to the realm of potential energy which the bands interface with known as the Quantum-Zone. A wearer can then travel through this trackless, featureless zone and emerge at a different point in our physical space light years away from his starting point only seconds later. His Quantum-bands would enable him to keep his bearings while in the zone and thus emerge where he wants to. He can cross countless light years in a single jump (Quasar regularly traveled from our star system to systems in other galaxies) if he so desires. Important note, however, she cannot quantum-jump within an atmosphere without ripping a hole in its ozone layer.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Communications:</b> The bands can detect, emit, and receive radio waves; thereby the bearer can communicate with other radio receivers. The bands can also create a “Quantum-link” which appears as a glowing golden sphere about 2 inches in diameter, which travels to the point of contact at warp speeds and connects with any communication device present allowing the bearer to carry on near-instantaneous communications even over extra-galactic distances.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Altered metabolism:</b> One previous bearer of the Quantum bands ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-boy/4005-2153/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2153\">Marvel Boy</a>) has been known to be able to augment his strength and stamina to unknown limits with the Quantum-bands. William Wesley was shown to be able to lift an automobile when he was field testing the \"Power-bands\". Quasar himself rarely exhibited this ability and only when it was needed. He once physically restrained <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a> by himself, whether this was a statement of his augmented physical strength or her own restraint is unknown, though she seemed to struggle against him.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Mental protection<u>:</u></b> Despite the fact that the Quantum-Bands have no control over the mind or Psionics, at least one previous bearer (Quasar) had \"programed\" the Bands to protect his mind for mental attacks and takeover. So powerful is this protection that powerful psychics, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/overmind/4005-4812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4812\">Overmind</a>could not overcome it.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Mental/Physical bond<u>:</u></b> The Quantum Bands bond with their bearer upon contact interfacing the bearer's mind with the Bands allowing for mental control. Permanently affixing themselves generally to the bearer's wrists, the flesh and bone within rendered indestructible so long as the bond with the bands persists. The bond can only be broken upon the bearer's death, at which point the bands could be removed easily.</li></ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Limitations:</b></p><ul><li><b>Worthiness</b><u>:</u> Similar to the hammer of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a>), a bearer of the Quantum-Bands must to be worthy. As the Quantum-Bands are tied to the station of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/protector-of-the-universe/4015-55736/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55736\">Protector of the Universe</a>, the bands seem to require a calm mind lacking ‘killer instinct’ to learn to use them to their fullest potential. A bearer with the intent to commit acts of depravity and destruction will quickly find himself losing control of the energy output of the bands until they disintegrate him.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Magic</b><u>:</u> The Bands cannot absorb it or resist it. However, an enchanted physical object will only be as strong as the object itself would otherwise be. Therefore, Thor's hammer (Mjolnir) will simply not shatter Quasar's forcefield like glass. Fortunately, magicians have no control over the energies he manipulates so, it evens out.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Extradimensional energy</b>: Quasar is susceptible to all persons using <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkforce/4015-41411/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41411\">Darkforce</a>. The Q-bands cannot create constructs to hold or resist darkforce energy. The Darkforce penetrates his energy like it wasn't even there. Also entities from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\">Negative-Zone</a> (such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilus/4005-10964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10964\">Annihilus</a>) can corrupt the bands if wearing them.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Kinetic energy</b>: The Quantum Bands have no defense against someone manipulating it psionically. (Which is why Maelstrom overwhelmed Quasar so easily to begin with), but a bearer can resist a kinetically imbued object (such as a knife or a deck of cards) If a bearer of the Quantum Bands senses the attack they can throw up a shield to defend themselves with.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Psionic energy</b>: A psionic blast will cut through any quantum constructs like paper mache'. Fortunately, most psionic manipulators are susceptible to the energies of the Quantum-Bands, so it evens out.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Matter manipulation</b>: Foes who manipulate matter, psionically or otherwise, the Quantum Bands cannot effect their powers. They deal with energy, not matter. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/molecule-man/4005-11880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11880\">Molecule Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sersi/4005-2118/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2118\">Sersi</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-girl/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Phoenix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kismet/4005-25678/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25678\">Her</a>, and the<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a>, among others, affect matter in a way that a bearer of the Q-bands cannot. However, Her, Sersi, and the Silver Surfer use cosmic energy to power their matter manipulation abilities and therefore a practiced bearer could affect the energy source, but not the ability itself.</li></ul>",

He looks up to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57750\" href=\"/rand-althor/4005-57750/\">Rand al'Thor</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31286\" href=\"/matrim-cauthon/4005-31286/\">Matrim Cauthon</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74471\" href=\"/perrin-aybara/4005-74471/\">Perrin Aybara</a>, all of whom are about four years older than him, and tries to tag along with them whenever possible. They tend to put up with him or ignore him, though Mat has a fondness for picking on him and playing tricks.  <br /><h2>Creation</h2> Ewin was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-28136\" href=\"/robert-jordan/4040-28136/\">Robert Jordan</a> for his book series <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, making his first appearance in the first book of the series, <i>The Eye of the World</i>.

He tells Rand and Mat about her, informing them of the mysterious pair's names, as well as the fact that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-74469\" href=\"/nynaeve-almeara/4005-74469/\">Nynaeve al'Meara</a> doesn't like Moiraine. He is later present when they meet.

On his first day on the job at his new precinct, he is murdered by a vicious gang of thugs lead by <a href=\"/clarence-boddicker/4005-73169/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73169\">Clarence Boddicker</a> who work for ruthless corporate executive <a href=\"/dick-jones/4005-73168/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73168\">Dick Jones</a>, who intends to control Delta City which is still in the planning stages. Lewis was separated when Murphy got killed, and Lewis couldn't do nothing. Murphy's body (although severely damaged) is then re-constructed into the first ever robotic law enforcement cyborg, who gradually begins to regain some recollection of his former life through encounters with members of the gang who took him out. A series of events leads Anne to become Robocop's partner once again. She was alerted by Kaplan and the others to her former comrade's treachery Lt. Hedgecock who attempts to destroy her partner and arrives at the <a href=\"/ocp/4060-54675/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54675\">OCP</a> Parking complex level 3, seeing her partner damaged and realizes Kaplan and the others failed to stop Hedgecock.</p><p>She helps him to get into her car, Lewis flees the scene with a damaged Robocop. During the police strike Lewis returns to the police station and furiously kills Hedgecock for his treachery and following Dick Jones' orders to destroy Robocop. She finds Robocop's equipment and goes to the steel mill. While staying in the steel mill, Clarence and his gang arrived having released by Dick Jones to finish Robocop and they kill the gang one by one.</p><p>She's injured in the shootout, while Robocop finally kills Clarence using his Data Spike and she was then rescued by Medical team led by Wareen Reed and Whitakker, the new SWAT leader. She is visited by Mayor Gibson who congratulate her for bringing her former comrade, the crime lord, and the corrupt OCP executive to justice.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4>RoboCop (1987)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38826/870855-robocopposter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870855\" data-ratio=\"1.5861344537815\" data-width=\"476\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 476px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.6%\" href=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38826/870855-robocopposter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870855\"><img alt=\"RoboCop\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38826/870855-robocopposter.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38826/870855-robocopposter.jpg 476w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38826/870855-robocopposter.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>RoboCop</figcaption></figure><p>Anne Lewis is portaged by actress <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Allen_(actress)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nancy Allen</a>.</p><h3>Television</h3><h3>Animated</h3><h4>RoboCop: The Animated Series (1988)</h4><p>In the 1980s <a href=\"/robocop-the-animated-series/4075-89/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-89\">animated series</a> Anne is portrayed as a much closer friend to Murphy, even attempting to help him become reacquainted with social functions like dating. Murphy's feelings for Lewis are much deeper due to this kind of interaction, as in episode \"The Hot Seat\" where Robocop wants to work alone so Lewis won't get hurt, Anne says, \"Murphy, so you do have feelings for me.\" When the chief says that Lewis will still be his partner, Anne winks at him.</p><p>In episode \"The Scrambler\" where Anne and Murphy go out on a date and in episode \"The Man In The Iron Suit\", Lt. Hedgecock, a prejudiced police officer jealous of Murphy, volunteers to test out a new prototype armor for OCP, challenging Murphy to a heated conflict inside a junkyard, where he almost succeeds in killing him. Anne is injured by Hedgecock when she tries to stop him. Murphy briefly snaps into a blind rage, pummeling Hedgecock and ripping apart his armor to get at the occupant.</p><p>Lewis recovers and persuades Murphy to let Hedgecock go, insisting they can use the recordings of the battle to press charges without taking the law into their own hands (although the tape is inevitably destroyed to appease The Old Man and protect the Robocop project), Murphy picks up Anne and departs the junkyard.</p>",

Every organization from the CIA to KGB wanted Ducard's services. In time, Ducard gained several enemies including a French Algerian named Jeremiah Hassan. Hassan was a Muslim fundamentalist who had several terrorist cells spread out through Europe but his last attempt to strike at Capitalism ended badly because of Ducard. Hassan orders one of his female loyalists to seduce Ducard and kill him at the opportune moment. The female loyalist introduces herself to Ducard as Felicity Strode. When the moment presented itself, Felicity decided not to kill Ducard because she discovered that she was baring Ducard's child. Felicity faked her death in order to escape Hassan's vengeful retribution and started a whole new life with Ducard.</p><p>For the next twelve years, Ducard trained his son Morgan in the art of killing while Felicity maintained her position as a nurturing maternal figure. Unfortunately, Hassan learned about Felicity's continued existence and decided to take matters into his own hands. Hassan captured Felicity and told her that she has twenty four hours to eliminate Ducard or her son will suffer for her failure. Felicity knew that she could not escape Hassan's threat so she decides to go along with the mission. Felicity calls Hassan and tells him that she is expecting Ducard any minute.</p><p>Henri Ducard was one of Batman's several trainers in the ways of combat and crime fighting. Wayne traveled to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56052\" href=\"/paris/4020-56052/\" slug=\"paris\">Paris</a> and sought out Ducard for his renowned skills as a detective. However, Ducard wanted to test out Wayne's potential by having his son Morgan challenge Wayne. Morgan surprised Wayne in an alley but Wayne proved his worth when he defeated Morgan. Ducard approaches Wayne with a silencer to his head and asks Wayne why he shouldn't just kill him for humiliating his son. Wayne then demonstrates his psychological ingenuity by toying with Ducard's vanity.</p><p>Wayne informs Ducard that he is aware of his involvement with Interpol. Interpol enlisted Ducard's services because they wanted an elusive <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55686\" href=\"/terrorism/4015-55686/\" slug=\"terrorism\">terrorist</a> cell to be taken out. Ducard agreed to Interpol's request because he wanted the chance to get revenge on Hassan, the leader of this terrorist cell. Hassan was the same man who gave Felicity Strode the responsibility to kill Ducard. Unfortunately, Ducard's tracking skills have only allowed him to get close to Hassan's lieutenants. Bruce on the other hand, has learned the exact location of Hassan and will provide the information if Ducard agrees to train him. Normally, Ducard would agree to such an offer and just kill the informant afterwards but he could not overlook Bruce's prowess as well as his knack for extracting near impossible information.</p><p>Ducard agreed to Bruce's offer and spent the next several months pairing Bruce with Morgan in the hopes of them working together as an elite killing force. Ducard eventually caught up with his prey and killed Hassan. Bruce decided to part ways with the Ducards because he didn't want to share their views on taking a life for the good of justice. However, Henri refused to allow this insult to go unpunished. Henri sends Morgan to eliminate Bruce while he was making arrangements to leave Paris. Morgan fails at his objective and Bruce drops Morgan's unconscious body on top of Ducard's workshop. Henri looked upon his son with great disappointment. Henri absolved any ties he had left with his son and Morgan was left as a shunned \"nobody\". Bruce didn't want to accept that Ducard was an amoral man who worked on both sides of the law but that all changed after he sent Morgan to kill him. Eventually they parted ways when they argued over whether it was right to take a life.</p><p>After Wayne became Batman, Ducard reentered Bruce's life when Bruce was accused of being a communist spy. Ducard was called in as a star witness by a government commission. The commission wanted Ducard's testimony on Bruce's eight year absence from Gotham as well as his activities while abroad. Ducard only agreed to help the commission if they clear him of his transgressions in France, Italy, El Slavador and the Islamic Republic of Syiraq where Hassan was hailed as a fallen hero. During his time in Gotham, Ducard learned that someone tried to assassinate Bruce.</p><p>With Bruce out of commission, the Batman was no longer present and Ducard began to put to and to together. Ducard wanted to share this information with the commission but Ducard respected Bruce more than his own devoted son. Ducard decide to keep this knowledge to himself and killed lead members in the commission to eliminate any opposition in Bruce's case. Before leaving Gotham, Ducard sent Bruce a letter dictating his admiration of Bruce's new found persona and informing him not to worry about the commission. Bruce was disgusted by Ducard's lack of morals when he killed the commission's chair people but he still allowed Ducard to continue his operations as a manhunter.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/2159224-ducard7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2159224\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4314381270903\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/2159224-ducard7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2159224\"><img alt=\"Ducard\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/2159224-ducard7.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64770/2159224-ducard7.jpg 299w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" data-width=\"299\"></a><figcaption>Ducard</figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\" href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" slug=\"tim-drake\">Tim Drake</a> and Ducard encountered each other when he was globe trotting as part of his training.

He later showed up pitting the assassin Deadshot against the man who stole his costume, arriving at Deadshot's hotel and giving him the location to meet the man who he had been training.

Bruce Wayne explains how Ducard once fell in love with an assassin from a terrorist cell named Felicity Strode (though Ducard was un-aware of her past) who planned to kill him but fell in love with him instead, birthing the child together. The terrorist cell eventually caught up with Strode and forced her to carry out her assingment.

Ducard is the alias used by Ra's Al Ghul when training Bruce to be a part of the League of Shadows. Henri later reveals his true identity as Ra's Al Ghul during Bruce's birthday party. Ra's/ Henri was working with Scarecrow in spreading his fear toxin through out Gotham thereby causing Gotham to tear itself apart through fear. Ra's/ Henri was defeated by Batman and left to die on a derailed train that plummeted into an adjacent building. It is not made clear if Henri Ducard was just an alias or was actually once his real name. He was portrayed by <b>Liam Neeson</b>. Neeson reprises the role in the <i>Batman Begins</i> Video Game.</p><p><b>The Dark Knight Rises</b></p><p>In the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises: Ra's al Ghul used his alias as Henri Ducard to work for a tribal warlord in the Middle East. During his time in the desert, Ra's/ Henri fell in love with the warlord's daughter. When the warlord learned of Ducard's involvement with his daughter, he wanted Ducard condemned to a prison known as the Lazarus Pit. Fortunately, the warlord's daughter made an arrangement with her father. She convinced her father that she is to blame for his dishonor and that she should be punished along with her unborn child.</p><p>The warlord agreed with his daughter's confession and condemned his daughter to the pit and Ducard was banished from the warlord's province. Ducard learned everything from the Sensei who led the League of Shadows so he could return to the warlord's province and take his revenge on the man who took away his great love. When Henri came back to the province, he found his wayward daughter Talia who had just escaped from the pit. Talia pleaded with her father to rescue her protector Ubu from the pit. Ra's agreed to his daughter's pleas and saved Ubu.</p><p>Afterwards, Ra's took his bloody revenge on the warlord and the prisoners who were responsible for the death of his great love. Henri then burnt down the province but not before condemning the warlord's loyal subjects to the pit. As time went by, Henri inducted Ubu into the ranks within the League of Shadows. In the beginning, Ra's respected Ubu for his caring devotion to Talia's well being and became Ubu's surrogate father. However, Ra's saw Ubu's ferocity with great disgust during his training. When he learned that Talia and Ubu had fallen in love, he had Ubu banished from the League. Talia followed Ubu afterwards, vowing never to forgive him, until his untimely death by the Batman during his attack of Gotham City.</p>",

The ruling couple had no worries except for one; They had no child. The Queen started getting depressed over this.</p><p>Praying to their family deity Deva Kaljayi a snake god for his blessings she becomes pregnant.</p><p>However the king's younger brother Nagpasha, who would become the king if there was no child, replaced a curtained plate that held the offerings for the god, with one containing a dead mongoose during the queen’s prayer times, angered the Snake God knocked her unconscious with his poisonous breath.</p><p>On seeing the grief of the king however the Snake God relented and showed him how to save the queen, unfortunately the method, a magic crystal, caused all the venom in her to enter the body of the baby who, when she gave birth, was blue and apparently dead.</p><p>As per the ritual at the time the body was thrown in the river, unknown to the king and queen and wicked prince Nagpasha the baby was really in suspended animation.</p><p>So when a very drunk Nagpasha went to the two-headed snake god Deva Kaljayi, the protector of the royal treasure, he was informed that the real successor was alive, angered Nagpasha attacked the god with his sword (he was very drunk after all) but with just one flick of his tale he knocked Nagpasha into two bowls in the treasure room, one holding the world’s most deadly venom and another that held a nectar that granted immortality. Rendering the evil prince both immortal and because of the venom both poisonous and horribly mutilated.</p><p>Meanwhile the child still blue and in suspended animation got struck some where in bushes where he lay for a long time, fortunately all the divine venom in him protected him from harm, as he lay there Deva Kaljayi appeared in the dreams of the also childless King Maniraj and his wife Queen Manika, rulers of Ichchhadhaari Naags a kingdom on the island Nagdweep in the Indian Ocean that was invisible to those on the outside so as to protect their far more advanced culture.</p><p>Many years passed and the treatment given by the king’s wise man started showing results, while still in a state of suspended animation, the color of the baby had changed to green.</p><p>This news was good enough that the King and Queen decided to adopt the child.</p><p>Later an evil shape-shifting Tantrik (snake-person) who stood to gain the thrown if the king and queen should have no children attacked the palace and escaped with the baby planning to kill the child he thought better of it, fearing that the same god who had led the king to him would punish him, so he abandoned the baby in the same place on the continent of India where he had originally been found.</p><p>(his plan by the way failed when the second king and queen had a daughter.)</p><p>Cured enough to come change from green to a more normal shade the baby woke up and started crying and was found by the priest of a nearby temple, later the priest gave the boy to a Professor Nagmani who was in the forest searching for snakes, it was Nagmani who discovered that the boy, whom he named Nagraj (King Snake) was no ordinary human, in fact instead of white blood cells he possessed millions of microscopic snakes!</p><p>He was also stronger, and quicker than any human, could shoot a venomous gas at will from his mouth, and had extraordinary healing powers. (other even more fantastic abilities would show up later.)</p><p>That’s when it turned out that the professor was no good, and as the Nagraj had been in suspended animation long enough that he had access to technology that let him to implant a mind controlling devise in the boy’s head, his plot being to turn him into the most powerful assassin for hire to villains and terrorist the world had ever seen, he also lied to Nagraj saying that he had created him in his lab.</p><p>During his first mission, which was to steal an ancient statue, he was foiled by the Sage Baba Gorakhnath who frees him from the mind control of Professor Nagamani letting him awaken to a larger world, in response to this Nagraj vows to rid the world of evil and terrorism, and considering that he starts out with three dedicated powerful arch-enemies already against him before even doing his first good deed, this is perhaps the wisest path he could follow.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/845004-nagraj_2b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-845004\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/845004-nagraj_2b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-845004\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/845004-nagraj_2b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/845004-nagraj_2b.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p><b>India’s most popular superhero.</b></p><p>Begun in the 1980’s, Nagraj is the longest running Indian superhero, the character has changed a lot over the years, both with his look, and his abilities, which at first were close to human normal, but then grew until he could shoot thousands of snakes out of wrists to form anything from whips, to nets, to even parachutes, and grew so strong that he was able to toss things into orbit.</p><p>Also at first he had no secret identity, the closest he would come would be to sometimes done a trench coat and slouch hat.</p><p>However he started taking the guise of Raj, a bespectacled bumbling Public relations officer of Bharti Communications.But during the Nagraj ke Baad series his secret identity is revealed to the entire media.

    "description": "<p>Created by Norman Marsh, Dan Dunn made his big splash in  newspaper comics, but started out in comic books.  Dunn started at the short-lived Humor Publications Co. in 1933 in a one-shot called Detective Dan, Secret Op. 48.</p> <p>Humor Pub. folded after only 3 issues. Marsh took Dunn to Publishers Syndicate who transferred him from comics to newspapers. </p> <p>On the whole Dan was pretty much a clone of Dick Tracy save that Dan sometimes went up against bad guys that wanted to take over the world . He often helped out a little orphan girl named Babs and her dog Wolf.  </p> <p>Like the Black Hood at Archie and Ka Zar at Timely he was one of the few comic book characters to appear in his own pulp magazine, which lasted only 2 issues.<br/><br/>A Dan Dunn radio series lasted for 78 episodes.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>\"The Revenant\" was inadvertently created by <a href=\"/morbius/4005-6722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6722\">Michael Morbius</a> when he had developed an antidote to combat the zombie virus which had been brought across to Earth-616 by <a href=\"/armor/4060-53864/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-53864\">A.R.M.O.R.</a>. The virus, however, adapted to the effects of antidote and became an airborne virus, a blood-red acid cloud which rained down infected blood onto those beneath it, killing all in its path.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Revenant was created by <a href=\"/fred-van-lente/4040-44637/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44637\">Fred Van Lente</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kevin-walker/4040-43502/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43502\">Kev Walker</a> and first appeared in<a href=\"/marvel-zombies-4/4050-26160/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26160\"><em> Marvel Zombies 4</em></a> #2.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>The Revenant was featured heavily in <em>Marvel Zombies 4</em>, threatening to infect the entire globe, it also caught the attention of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dormammu/4005-2205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2205\">Dormammu</a> who sought to use it to spread his own influence. At the climax of the series, the virus was sent into the body of <a href=\"/zombie/4005-13797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13797\">Simon Garth</a>, threatening to be unleashed if Garth should ever be destroyed, it hasn't been seen or referred to since.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Revenant is an airborne virus which spreads through infected blood and kills all living substances (human, animal or plant-life) it comes into contact with. The virus also re-animates the corpses of those it kills almost immediately. The Revenant has no sentience and is driven only by a biochemical desire to spread. It is said that The Revenant could infect the entire globe within a day, and would consume the small island nation of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/taino/4020-58782/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58782\">Taino</a> in under an hour.</p><p>The Revenant was able to adapt itself it combat threats, such as the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/man-thing/4005-4988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4988\">Man-Thing</a> which was restoring to life nature which Revenant was destroying. To this end, Revenant was able to animate a body, composed of several parts of <a href=\"/wicked-brigade/4060-56588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56588\">Wicked Brigade</a> (a group of superheroes it had previously killed), to stop Man-Thing.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Relatively little is known about John Pizer. He was probably born c. 1850, and was a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55922\" href=\"/poland/4020-55922/\" slug=\"poland\">Polish</a> Jew. In 1888 he lived and worked as a bootmaker in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54050\" href=\"/whitechapel/4020-54050/\" slug=\"whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a>. He was the favoured early suspect of Sergeant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62810\" href=\"/william-thick/4005-62810/\" slug=\"william-thick\">William Thick</a>, who had known Pizer for years and who apparently had interacted with him when Pizer had allegedly carried out a series of minor assaults on prostitutes in Whitechapel. Pizer later claimed that his arrest was based on animosity on Thick's part, although Pizer did have a previous conviction for a stabbing offence.  <br/> <br/>His nickname was Leather Apron, a nickname that was applied to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28606\" href=\"/jack-the-ripper/4005-28606/\" slug=\"jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> in the early days of the killings. This similarity appears to have been the only reason Pizer was associated with the case. The association of the killings with the name can be traced back to early September after the murder of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62795\" href=\"/mary-ann-nichols/4005-62795/\" slug=\"mary-ann-nichols\">Polly Nichols</a>, and was first put forward in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>. It does not appear to have been associated with the crimes because of any substantial evidence.     <br/> <br/>He was arrested on September 10th, 1888, although there was no evidence against him. He was released soon after, when it was determined that he had been out of Whitechapel for two of the murders; during one he was staying with relatives, and during another he was talking with a police officer at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\" href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" slug=\"london\">London</a> Docks. Pizer died in 1897 </p>",

    "description": "<p>William Stevens was a printer who lived at Crossingham's Lodging House, which was located at 35 Dorset Street, Spitalfields, in the autumn of 1888. On September 8th, 1888 at approximately 12:12 a.m. he entered the kitchen at the lodging house and encountered fellow lodger <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62794\" href=\"/annie-chapman/4005-62794/\" slug=\"annie-chapman\">Annie Chapman</a>, who had been having a drink with another fellow lodger, Frederick Stevens. She told them that she had gone to Vauxhall to see her sister, and that she had been given five pence. Presumably she then spent this money on drink. Chapman took a box of pills out of her pocket, which she presumably obtained at the casual ward, and which split. She put the pills into a piece of envelope and left. Stevens assumed she had gone to bed. Stevens' testimony was mainly useful in ascertaining the origin of the envelope found with Chapman's body. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Little is known about Timothy Donovan. He was probably born sometime around 1858 or 1859. In 1888 he was working as the deputy of Crossingham's Lodging House, which was located at 35 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. He testified that on the 7th of September <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62794\" href=\"/annie-chapman/4005-62794/\" slug=\"annie-chapman\">Annie Chapman</a> asked him if she could use the kitchen and told him that she had spent some time in the infirmary. She left at about 1:45 the next morning, and asked him to hold her regular bed. He chided her for having drunk her doss money away and encouraged her to earn her money quickly. This was the last time he would see her alive. He later identified the body and testified at the inquest.  <br/> <br/>There has been some speculation as to what happened to Timothy Donovan after Annie's murder. There are two major claims. The first suggests that he died on November 1st, 1888 at London Hospital of a combination of cirrhosis of the liver, exhaustion and phthisis at the age of 29. The other suggests that he was the 30-year-old man repeatedly brought before the Thames Magistrates Court between 1887 and 1888 on charges of assault, and who ultimately murdered his wife in 1904. There is no evidence to support either of these claims.    </p>",
