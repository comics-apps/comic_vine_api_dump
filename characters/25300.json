    "description": "<p>To say hastur is to invite his wrath for he has a large chance of hearing. He will at first send his servants, the dreaded batlike byakhee. If they are defeated he himself will come to destroy the blasphemer. A way of jokingly bringing their friends or seriously bringing their foes' doom was by saying \"My dying words are hastur, hastur, hastur...\" and they would say his name until Hastur hears it.</p><p>Hastur is the half brother of Cthulhu, though he has no special love for his half brother, for Hastur is the master of Air, and Cthulhu is the master of Water, and they are opposing elements. Which is intriguing as this is a departure from classical elemental theories.</p><p>A master manipulator, he is no less powerful than his brother and has the ability to laugh off nuclear weapons, bring madness with ease, and has mastered every spell in existence, including the spell to summon Azathoth, which is quoted as having the ability to fry an entire universe with incredible ease. He also has the power of shapeshifting, having taken on the form of a human dressed in yellow garments, a vaguely octopus like creature, a gigantic reptilian humanoid with tentacles writhing all over it's body, a pulsing blob of writhing tentacles, and worse.</p>",

After Straxus joined in an alliance with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4103\" href=\"/megatron/4005-4103/\" slug=\"megatron\">Megatron</a> and the Decepticons of Earth, Bombshell was transported by the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55730\" href=\"/space-bridge/4015-55730/\" slug=\"space-bridge\">Space Bridge</a> to Earth. Along with the other Insecticons <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42018\" href=\"/kickback/4005-42018/\" slug=\"kickback\">Kickback</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2546\" href=\"/shrapnel/4005-2546/\" slug=\"shrapnel\">Shrapnel</a>, they were then reformatted into insect alt-modes. This granted impressive mass shifting powers that enabled them to shrink down to the size of actual insects when transforming.</p><p>The Insecticons' first mission on Earth was to set up a conduit between Cybertron and <a data-ref-id=\"4020-58158\" href=\"/hoover-dam/4020-58158/\" slug=\"hoover-dam\">Hoover Dam</a>, stealing the hydro-electrical power. Bombshell tracked down the assistant chief engineer, Ricky Vasquez, and implanted him with a cerebro-shell so that the Decepticons could infiltrate the plant. Vasquez suck Megatron and the Insecticons into the control room where Shrapnel was able to take electronic control of the dam. Vasquez eventually managed to reassert his free will and, assist the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42030\" href=\"/aerialbots/4060-42030/\" slug=\"aerialbots\">Aerialbots</a> in stopping the Decepticons.</p><p>Bombshell took advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55742\" href=\"/ark/4055-55742/\" slug=\"ark\">Ark</a> by riding <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48561\" href=\"/silverbolt/4005-48561/\" slug=\"silverbolt\">Silverbolt</a> back to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40489\" href=\"/autobots/4060-40489/\" slug=\"autobots\">Autobot</a> base. While inside, he planted one of his cerebro-shell inside <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6467\" href=\"/optimus-prime/4005-6467/\" slug=\"optimus-prime\">Optimus Prime</a> when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7408\" href=\"/ratchet/4005-7408/\" slug=\"ratchet\">Ratchet</a> was cleaning a recent wound. He was unable to control Prime, but managed to connect a radio link to Megatron through Soundwave. Bombshell's implant was also able to divert some of the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55759\" href=\"/matrix-of-leadership/4055-55759/\" slug=\"matrix-of-leadership\">Creation Matrix</a> to the Decepticons, bringing life to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41935\" href=\"/stunticons/4060-41935/\" slug=\"stunticons\">Stunticons</a>. Bombshell's implant was eventually discovered, but the damage was done.</p><p>Later, Megatron commissioned Bombshell and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15340\" href=\"/dirge/4005-15340/\" slug=\"dirge\">Dirge</a> to take control of Power Station Alpha. Sighting <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30511\" href=\"/bumblebee/4005-30511/\" slug=\"bumblebee\">Bumblebee</a> in the installation, Bombshell inserted a cerebro-shell in a human boy as a distraction, sending him off into danger while the Decepticon infiltrated Alpha and placed a specially-modified shell inside. The Autobots were unable to retrieve it then, because <a data-ref-id=\"4060-12206\" href=\"/gi-joe/4060-12206/\" slug=\"gi-joe\">G.I. Joe</a> took hostile action against Bumblebee. Superion came to Bee's rescue, but later that night the remote control was triggered and Power Station Alpha was activated. Unfortunately for the Decepticons, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11032\" href=\"/dr-mindbender/4005-11032/\" slug=\"dr-mindbender\">Doctor Mindbender</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-7417\" href=\"/cobra/4060-7417/\" slug=\"cobra\">Cobra</a> was able to lock onto the electronic frequency of Bombshell's shell and bring Alpha to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56485\" href=\"/cobra-island/4020-56485/\" slug=\"cobra-island\">Cobra Island</a> instead. Dirge and Bombshell were forced into the position of emissaries for the Decepticon cause, proposing an alliance between them and Cobra in order to share Power Station Alpha's potential.</p><p>While Mindbender was acting as Cobra's \"ambassador\", he uncovered the severity of their plans for Alpha, and the devastating effect it would have on the Earth. Cobra switched sides and joined in an alliance with G.I. Joes and the Autobots. Mindbender was deemed unnecessary and Bombshell attempted to execute him. Instead, the Insecticon was disabled by a blast from one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11022\" href=\"/baroness/4005-11022/\" slug=\"baroness\">Baroness</a>'s cannon weapons. As the two Cobra agents left to join <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11037\" href=\"/serpentor/4005-11037/\" slug=\"serpentor\">Serpentor</a>, Mindbender scooped up the unconscious Bombshell in his tiny insect mode, in the hopes of dissecting his circuitry later. After arriving at the Joe base they discovered the connection between Bombshell and his cerebro-shells. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7661\" href=\"/mainframe/4005-7661/\" slug=\"mainframe\">Mainframe</a> inspected the shell that had been surgically retrieved from the boy Bombshell tagged earlier, it caused the still-inactive Insecticon to spontaneously transform out of his own control.</p><p>How Bombshell eventually regained control of his systems and returned to the Decepticons is unknown. He was later seen participating in a raid on an oil tanker. He used his cerebro-shells to quickly locate the vessel's control room. Unfortunately, the tanker turned out to be empty. When Decepticon leadership eventually passed to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43865\" href=\"/ratbat/4005-43865/\" slug=\"ratbat\">Ratbat</a>, Bombshell joined his troops.</p><h4><span>IDW Publishing</span></h4><p>Bombshell has not yet appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-50452\" href=\"/transformers-regeneration-one/4050-50452/\" slug=\"transformers-regeneration-one\">Regeneration One</a>.</p><h3><span>IDW Continuity</span></h3><h4><span>Spotlight: Blaster</span></h4><p>Shortly after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56302\" href=\"/thunderwing/4005-56302/\" slug=\"thunderwing\">Thunderwing</a>'s assault on Cybertron, a prototype of the Insecticons called \"Bombshell\" injected a cerebro-shell into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41994\" href=\"/beachcomber/4005-41994/\" slug=\"beachcomber\">Beachcomber</a> under <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7405\" href=\"/soundwave/4005-7405/\" slug=\"soundwave\">Soundwave</a>'s orders.

After his creation, he constructed a portal between Cybertron and Earth, which the Decepticons used to transport defeated Autobots. After using the portal to get rid of the Autobots on Earth, the Decepticons attacked New York City. During the assault, Bombshell tore apart <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42562\" href=\"/air-force/4060-42562/\" slug=\"air-force\">Air Force</a> jets in his giant beetle mode. He later attended Megatron's victory speech in the ruins of the city.</p><p>Battle lines started being drawn between the Insecticons and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48451\" href=\"/seekers/4060-48451/\" slug=\"seekers\">Seekers</a>. In Beijing, Bombshell began mocking <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41836\" href=\"/skywarp/4005-41836/\" slug=\"skywarp\">Skywarp</a> and the Seekers, as being ignored by their flight commander and cast aside by Megatron in favor of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41858\" href=\"/constructicons/4060-41858/\" slug=\"constructicons\">Constructicons</a>. Despite his mind games, Bombshell and the Insecticons quickly scurried off when both Skywarp and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41837\" href=\"/thundercracker/4005-41837/\" slug=\"thundercracker\">Thundercracker</a> attacked them. After returning to New York, Bombshell was approached by Starscream, who apologized for the behavior of his fellow Seekers, and told the Insecticons about how he envisioned the future of the Decepticon Empire, with him as leader. Bombshell was eventually captured by former <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55725\" href=\"/headmaster/4015-55725/\" slug=\"headmaster\">Headmaster</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56350\" href=\"/hunter-onion/4005-56350/\" slug=\"hunter-onion\">Hunter O'Nion</a> and started performing experiments on him.</p><p>Bombshell was eventually freed and used <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57865\" href=\"/jhiaxus/4005-57865/\" slug=\"jhiaxus\">Jhiaxus</a>'s technology, given to the Decepticons by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42008\" href=\"/sixshot/4005-42008/\" slug=\"sixshot\">Sixshot</a>, Bombshell constructed a space bridge in New York. In addition, he managed to use Hunter to create a \"hub\", which the Decepticons used to find Autobots all across the galaxy and deactivate their defenses. When Megatron complimented his work, Bombshell explained that human minds intrigued him, and that he found experimenting on them to be quite \"delicious\". He then eventually betrayed Megatron, as he had been convinced by Starscream's and took the Seeker's side in his rebellion. To escape Megatron then threw Kickback at him.</p><p>When the Autobots returned to Earth, and a massive battle broke out in New York. Bombshell jumped <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42020\" href=\"/sideswipe/4005-42020/\" slug=\"sideswipe\">Sideswipe</a> and taunted the Autobot by claiming to have toyed with his brother's mind with information he had extracted from Hunter. He was punched out by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41962\" href=\"/kup/4005-41962/\" slug=\"kup\">Kup</a> before he could kill Sideswipe, and the Decepticons soon found themselves defeated. As the Decepticons fled the planet aboard <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41838\" href=\"/astrotrain/4005-41838/\" slug=\"astrotrain\">Astrotrain</a>, Bombshell cheered for Starscream when he revealed that he was in possession of the Matrix of Leadership.</p><h4>Transformers</h4><p>Despite Starscream's \"ascension\", the Decepticon army began to crumble without clear direction. Bombshell and the rest of Starscream's followers eventually retreated to a lifeless planetoid in a distant solar system. Refugees from the broken Decepticon war machine began to trickle in over the next three years. Starscream ordered Bombshell to find some way to strengthen their meager energon reserves and keep what remained of the army properly fueled.</p><p>Bombshell regarded this as a fool's errand, and left the Decepticons to find their own way to conserve fuel. As the strong cannibalized the weak for resources, Bombshell worked on perfecting his cerebro-shell technology, and cobbled together a prototype to present to Starscream. It proved highly effective against <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49446\" href=\"/quake/4005-49446/\" slug=\"quake\">Quake</a>, who had decided to attack Starscream. Bombshell incapacitated Quake long enough for Starscream to eliminate the mutineer. Intrigued, Starscream requested Bombshell begin production of more cerebro-shells.</p><p>Later, Bombshell reported to an uninterested Starscream that an approaching Autobot ship had crashed into their defenses. Being Tempted by the Matrix, Bombshell made an offer to take care of it, but Starscream violently repelled him. Together with Shrapnel and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-63503\" href=\"/acid-storm/4005-63503/\" slug=\"acid-storm\">Acid Storm</a>, he went to scavenge the ship's wreckage for anything useful, only to be attacked by the pilot, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41691\" href=\"/rodimus-prime/4005-41691/\" slug=\"rodimus-prime\">Rodimus</a>. Bombshell tried to fire one of his new cerebro-shells at the intruder, who blocked it with a piece of metal and defeated him.</p><h4><span>Chaos</span></h4><p>Megatron would later use space bridge technology built into in his new body to summon Bombshell and the rest of the Decepticons to him on Cybertron. At first they did battle with the Autobots, but were soon mind-controlled by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41902\" href=\"/galvatron/4005-41902/\" slug=\"galvatron\">Galvatron</a> into combining with his Sweep army and forming a huge monster. Once this monster was defeated by Megatron, the Decepticons were left weakened and easily captured by the Autobots. After three weeks in captivity, they were released to help the Autobots with a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59510\" href=\"/nails/4060-59510/\" slug=\"nails\">NAIL</a> riot and had I/D chips implanted to keep them from going overboard.</p><h4><span>Robots in Disguise</span></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2480990\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2303370786517\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2480990\"><img alt=\"Bombshell\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg 534w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bombshell\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg 534w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2480990-bombshell_tf_all_hail_megatron_8.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bombshell</figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-42007\" href=\"/needlenose/4005-42007/\" slug=\"needlenose\">Needlenose</a>, fed up with working as an enforcer for the Autobots, accused Bombshell, Soundwave and Shockwave of just sitting around instead of doing something about the Decepticons' situation. In reality, all three of them were secretly in on Ratbat's plan to assassinate the Autobot leader and rise up against their captors. When Ratbat was then mysteriously found dead, the Autobots claimed it was suicide, but Bombshell and the other Decepticons didn't believe them.</p><p>With Ratbat gone, Bombshell made his own plans, intending to use the peace to his advantage. His first step was to use a cerebro-shell to turn <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42015\" href=\"/sunstorm/4005-42015/\" slug=\"sunstorm\">Sunstorm</a> into his slave. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42021\" href=\"/skydive/4005-42021/\" slug=\"skydive\">Skydive</a> disagreed he was forced to murder him. Later when Dirge found the body, Bombshell placed another cerebro-shell on him to prevent him from telling anyone he was responsible. Unfortunately <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41833\" href=\"/prowl/4005-41833/\" slug=\"prowl\">Prowl</a> found the device and tracked him back to his lair. Ordering Sunstorm to keep Prowl and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44364\" href=\"/arcee/4005-44364/\" slug=\"arcee\">Arcee</a> busy, he fled into the reclamation tunnels and recruited the Constructicons's help. Escape was no use as Prowl eventually cornered him and demanded to know what he was doing and who he was working with. When Bombshell refused to answer, Prowl executed him on the spot by shooting him in the head.</p><h2><span><span>Powers &amp; Weaknesses</span></span></h2><p>Bombshell is able to change his side, and in his insect form, Bombshell is particularly adept at using his tiny size to infiltrate secure areas. He has a flying range of 5.7 miles in his alt-mode. He uses his stinger to inject a tiny \"cerebro-shell\" into human targets. The micro-circuited shell attaches to the brain, and allows Bombshell complete control. In his robot-mode his stinger's laser torch can cut into the Autobots and allows him to inject his cerebro-shells. His robot-mode also carries a head-mounted mortar that can throw a 50-pound explosive shell 8 miles. Unfortunatley successful removal of one of Bombshell's cerebro-shells allows its possessor to use it against him by sending false signals back to him. His torch is also unable to cut through tougher metals.

During his first mission they ran into Optimus Prime. Durining the Dark Ages, Bombshell and his fellow future Insecticons served under Shockwave as part of the primary Decepticon faction. At one point, they assaulted <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48727\" href=\"/bludgeon/4005-48727/\" slug=\"bludgeon\">Bludgeon</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56234\" href=\"/chaos-trinity/4060-56234/\" slug=\"chaos-trinity\">Chaos Trinity</a> in Altihex to stop the chaos unleashed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58724\" href=\"/the-fallen/4005-58724/\" slug=\"the-fallen\">The Fallen</a>.

Megatron's sudden arrival with the Aerospace Extermination Squadron put a quick stop to those peace talks. Bombshell was later assigned to guard Autobot prisoners.</p><h4><span>Generation 1</span></h4><p>After Bombshell arrived on Earth he began operating outside his mission parameters. Having taken over a small town in rural America, Bombshell had begun mass production of techno-organic <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57702\" href=\"/insecticon-swarm/4060-57702/\" slug=\"insecticon-swarm\">Insecti-clones</a> being grown from special pods.

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Taylor Madison was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\" href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" slug=\"zeus\">Zeus</a> as bait for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13898\" href=\"/hera/4005-13898/\" slug=\"hera\">Hera</a> and Ares to reveal their plans to hurt and defeat his son Hercules once and for all. Taylor first met Hercules, along with his fellow <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\" href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" slug=\"avengers\">Avengers</a>; <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\" href=\"/crystal/4005-2115/\" slug=\"crystal\">Crystal</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7611\" href=\"/thunderstrike/4005-7611/\" slug=\"thunderstrike\">Thunderstrike</a>, at a children's hospital. They both immediately felt a strong attraction toward each other and soon fell in love. Strangely, Taylor tried to break it off many times because she had a feeling that her time was limited. The two did have a passionate relationship, though it ended quickly when Hera, realizing Hercules truly loved Taylor, determined the best way to hurt Hercules was by harming Taylor. This lead to a terrible confrontation and battle between Hercules until it was finally revealed by Zeus that Taylor Madison had never truly existed; she was only a construct he'd created to draw Hera and he foul plans into the open. Zeus was able to stop Hera's evil deeds, though at the cost of great emotional pain to Hercules when Taylor Madison's true nature was revealed and, by the will of Zeus, she ceased to exist. Devastated, Hercules lashed out at Zeus for his cruelty and callousness in handling this entire matter. All-mighty Zeus, unaccustomed to such insolence, reacted with swift and wrathful judgement by taking away much of Hercules' godly powers including his immortality, durability and half of his enormous godly strength and stamina.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Origin</h2><p>Judith Ali is a human in the 30 Days of Night series.  She owned a store in New Orleans, Louisiana called Miss Judith's Curio Show where she dealt in the dark arts.  Not only was she aware of the existence of vampires, but sought hard evidence to prove their existence.  She arranged for a local speed-freak named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48485\" href=\"/george/4005-48485/\" slug=\"george\">George</a> to keep an ear to the ground for vampire communications and signs of activity.  In 2001 George had uncovered communication between a vampire named Marlow and someone who signed his letters only with the letter V.  The communication was about an event planned for a remote town in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-48407\" href=\"/barrow/4020-48407/\" slug=\"barrow\">Barrow</a>, Alaska.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity to finally acquire the proof she so desired, Judith sent her only son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48466\" href=\"/taylor-ali/4005-48466/\" slug=\"taylor-ali\">Taylor Ali</a> to fly to Barrow to investigate.  Taylor was killed quickly in Barrow by the elder vampire, Vicente, but was able to send video back to Judith before his death.  Taylor's death sent Judith into into a downward spiral.  She had her proof, but lost the desire to do anything with it.  She closed her store and and shut herself in.  She no longer took the care to keep up her long, tall hair, and her clothing reflected her lack of care.  No longer were her walls adorned with objects that reflected her trade, but were now covered with make-shift crosses.</p><p>During this time <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47982\" href=\"/stella-olemaun/4005-47982/\" slug=\"stella-olemaun\">Stella Olemaun</a>, one of the few survivors of the Barrow incident, had published a book about the experience in order to bring the vampires out of hiding.  George sought out Judith after learning about the book and brought her a copy.  Stella's bold move of publishing the book renewed Judith's will to fight.  She knew that the combination of Stella's story and her video evidence of the event would help to expose the vampires so that they could be wiped out, and her son's death could be avenged.</p><p>Judith caught up with Stella at a stop in her book tour in California.  They quickly found kindred spirits in each other.  Stella had also lost someone in Barrow--her husband, Eben, who had given his life to save her.  Teaming up with Stella made Judith a target.  The pair were under surveillance wherever they went.  One evening a vampire posing as an FBI agent came to her room with a sympathetic ear.  Judith quickly realized who he was, but it was too late.  Judith had pulled her handgun with the intention of acting, but she was unable to match the speed and ferocity of her attacker.  Judith was shot through the head at point blank range, and died in her room.</p>",

    "deck": "When Gary Wilton's parents discovered there were complications with his mother's pregnancy, they injected her with a chemical to correct the fetal deficiency.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gary and Maxine Wilson were research scientists that worked for a major drug company when they received some bad news during their first pregnancy. The doctor informed Maxine that their was some complications with the fetus she was carrying and chances were slim that the pregnancy would go to full term. The baby would probably be seriously malformed if it survived to full term so the doctor asked her if she wanted to terminate the pregnancy. Maxine and her husband refused and they both worked in secret at the lab until they were able to isolate a chemical which might correct the fetal deficiency. Maxine took a chance and endured several shots at regular intervals for the next few months. Six months later, the couple were involved a horrific car accident and Gary Wilton was killed and Maxine was rushed to the hospital. Maxine gave birth to her son, Gary Wilton Junior but he was assisted by a respirator. Gary Wilton Jr had no apparent physical malformations and Maxine intended to keep him that way. Maxine was very protective of her son and would not allow people to hold him without gloves or let Gary Jr climb trees to ensure his safety. However things would change when Maxine married a man named Roger Morely, owner of Daedalus Airlines. Morely didn't like the fact that his step-son was a wimp and Gary Jr became more timid as he grew up. Gary had no idea that the chemicals his mother injected into herself during the pregnancy had altered his genes and he was about to undergo a dramatic change nearly two decades later. Gary was walking down a street when he came across a mugging involving a local gang. The gang chased Gary into an abandoned building onto the rooftop where he was cornered. A gang member fired a shot and Gary fell off the building. Gary's body transformed into Raptor during the fall and gain the ability to fly. Raptor flew to the rooftop and attacked the gang with his talons and beak. One gang member tried to escape by jumping onto the next building but he would die in the fall. Raptor descended to the ground and hid behind some bushes and trees where he would change back to human form.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Creation</h2><p>Raptor was created by Dave Ross and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-west-coast-annual-8-if-volcanic-winter-co/4000-36650/\">Avengers West Coast Annual issue 8</a> (1993).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Meeting the West Coast Avengers</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gary Wilton Jr would be at a park near <a href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\"> San Francisco</a>'s Coit Tower when he sees members of the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\"> West Coast Avengers</a> appear from their quinjet. Gary became fearful and confused so he wanted to get away. He stumbled off the path and his pencil clip fell down a drain when he tripped. The pencil clip was from his stepfather so he climbed down the drain and discovered <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\"> Ultron</a> and <a href=\"/alkhema/4005-19946/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19946\"> Alkhema</a> inside the underground tunnel system. Ultron detected Gary behind the grated screen and pulled the scared teen towards him with a magnetic beam. Ultron was intrigued about the strange aura flaring around Gary when the West Coast Avengers appeared. Ultron was forced to drop Gary when he was struck by an arrow from <a href=\"/clint-barton/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\"> Hawkeye</a>. Ultron was able to hypnotize the Avengers with a strong mesmeric ray and place them under his control. Gary found Hawkeye's communicard and tried to escape during the battle but was found by Ultron. The aura started to flare around Gary and he transformed into Raptor. Alkhema and Ultron tried to apprehend Raptor but he managed to escape. Raptor heard the voice of <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\"> Iron Man</a> from the communicard in his pocket and he informed the golden Avenger that his friends were in danger. Raptor met Iron Man and informed him of Ultron's plans to create a volcanic winter by activating three seismic activators at volcanoes located in <a href=\"/alaska/4020-55827/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55827\"> Alaska</a>, <a href=\"/mexico/4020-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55820\"> Mexico</a> and <a href=\"/washington-state/4020-56542/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56542\"> Washington State</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Raptor told Iron Man that he wanted to be on the kill when he confronts Ultron's minions. A brief scuffle ensued when Iron Man told Raptor that he was saving the Avengers and not killing them. They both realized that the true enemy was Ultron and Iron Man allowed Raptor to tag along but was forbidden to kill any human beings. Raptor and Iron Man reached Mt. Saint Helen where they saw several scientist being held captive by the mind controlled <a href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\"> US Agent</a> and <a href=\"/arachne/4005-16197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\"> Spider Woman</a>. Raptor grabs Spider Woman and they go airborne but Carpenter punches the bird man. Raptor is knocked out and changes back to human form during the fall. Gary falls on top of Iron Man as he attempts to stop one of the seismic activators. Gary and Iron Man are held captive by Ultron and Alkhema. Ultron would concentrate all his energy on his mesmeric ray to hypnotize Iron Man but it would weaken his mental control on the rest of the Avengers. The Avengers are liberated from their trance and Gary wakes up during the fight. Gary would transform into Raptor when he sees Ultron and rushes towards him. Ultron would put up a powerful force field and Raptor flies into it. Ultron is defeated when Alkehema betrays him. Raptor chases after Alkhema when she takes flight but he gets too close to her flaming exhaust. Raptor begins to plummet towards the ground and is back in human form when he lands.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>Several American superhumans attempt to flee to <a href=\"/france/4020-55778/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\"> France</a> after the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\"> Superhuman Registration Act</a> had passed.

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Origin</h2><p>Prior to the events at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-48407\" href=\"/barrow/4020-48407/\" slug=\"barrow\">Barrow</a>, Alaska, George was helping <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48465\" href=\"/judith-ali/4005-48465/\" slug=\"judith-ali\">Judith Ali</a> with her quest to expose the vampire society.  She had him monitoring electronic communications for certain names, catch phrases, etc.  For months the lines were completely silent.  Suddenly, right before the incident at Barrow occurred, George uncovered an encrypted communication between <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48402\" href=\"/marlow-roderick/4005-48402/\" slug=\"marlow-roderick\">Marlow Roderick</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48404\" href=\"/vicente/4005-48404/\" slug=\"vicente\">Vicente</a>  (calling himself only \"V\").  The series of three letters mentioned the event planned for Barrow, an invitation for V to join, and his acceptance.</p><p>George brought the letters to Judith.  Judith would in turn send her son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48466\" href=\"/taylor-ali/4005-48466/\" slug=\"taylor-ali\">Taylor Ali</a> to Barrow to investigate, resulting in his death.  Taylor's death caused Judith to lose her will to fight.</p><p>After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47982\" href=\"/stella-olemaun/4005-47982/\" slug=\"stella-olemaun\">Stella Olemaun</a>, one of the few survivors of Barrow, published a book detailing what happened George sought out Judith with a copy.  It was this encounter that pushed Judith to seek out Stella with the video evidence Taylor had acquired to finally expose the vampires.  Judith would die shortly after embarking on this journey at the hands of the vampire <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48540\" href=\"/agent-norris/4005-48540/\" slug=\"agent-norris\">Agent Norris</a>.  When Norris' mistress <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48406\" href=\"/lilith/4005-48406/\" slug=\"lilith\">Lilith</a> was killed, he sought out George hoping to find information to help him understand being a vampire.</p><p>Locked in his home, George heard a knock at his door.  Hoping it was Miss Judith he answered to find Agent Norris staring from the other side.  Norris knocked in the door and beat George, tying him up.  Falling deep into withdraw symptoms, George was unable to provide Norris with the information he desired.  Tired of waiting, Norris bit and turned George.  As a vampire George felt an instant loyalty to Norris and told him everything he knew about vampire society.  George also explained to Norris that the strange emotions he had been feeling was the call of the other vampires back to Barrow, Alaska.  Norris took George on as his vampire lackey and the two departed.</p><p>Arriving in Alaska George and Norris met up with the other vampires led by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48809\" href=\"/werner/4005-48809/\" slug=\"werner\">Werner</a>.  The group led two phases of attacks on Barrow, being finally destroyed during the second wave.  George was shot and killed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48543\" href=\"/marcus-kitka/4005-48543/\" slug=\"marcus-kitka\">Marcus Kitka</a> shortly after Norris was killed by Stella Olemaun.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Footsteps</h2> <p>Payens was the son of the original Templar. When his dad died during a mission with the original <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48487\" href=\"/sentinels/4060-48487/\" slug=\"sentinels\">Sentinels</a>, Payens felt it was up to him to continue the legacy. He became the second Templar and reformed the Sentinels along with other children of the originals. All was going well until his brother James, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48651\" href=\"/switchfast/4005-48651/\" slug=\"switchfast\">Switchfast</a>, died. This event caused the team to dissolve and Payens continued fighting crime solo with the help of <a data-ref-id=\"4055-48517\" href=\"/cyprus/4055-48517/\" slug=\"cyprus\">Cyprus</a>.</p><p>Payens fought solo until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48515\" href=\"/electron/4005-48515/\" slug=\"electron\">Electron</a>, a teammate, confronted him about reforming the team, but Payens wasn’t convinced until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48617\" href=\"/harlette/4005-48617/\" slug=\"harlette\">Harlette</a>, another teammate, was attacked by mysterious demons. The team got together again, but the reunion was cut short when the headquarters was blown up and the team got whisked away to a hell dimension run by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48616\" href=\"/gospel/4005-48616/\" slug=\"gospel\">Gospel</a>’s father. The team got split up as a last resort and Payens was with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48615\" href=\"/firebomb/4005-48615/\" slug=\"firebomb\">Firebomb</a> during an attack of demons. During the battle Payens felt like he was loosing control of the soulblade and used it to return to the rest of the team. He managed to show up just in time to help Gospel end Damien’s evil. At the cost of her life, Payens used his soulblade on both her and Damien and the team was sent home with the last of her strength.</p> <p>Now back home, Payens was without a home since he had been living at the HQ that had been destroyed. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48619\" href=\"/serpenta/4005-48619/\" slug=\"serpenta\">Serpenta</a> offered him a place to stay and Payens gave in to a moment of weakness and told her about his insecurities as far as leading the team with two deaths already on his shoulder. He also feels like now he’s being challenged by Harlette for leadership. The team regroups once again and Payens tells them that, although the base was destroyed, he believes Cyprus is still out there and he can use it to find Gospel; however, he tells the team they need to go back to the base, which is now under government control.</p><p>When they arrive at the location they got in a fight with a new government sanctioned superteam, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48516\" href=\"/squadron-7/4060-48516/\" slug=\"squadron-7\">Squadron 7</a>, led by James’ wife, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48652\" href=\"/agent-huggins/4005-48652/\" slug=\"agent-huggins\">Agent Huggins</a>. The team seemed to have the edge until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48621\" href=\"/splash/4005-48621/\" slug=\"splash\">Splash</a> showed up and rescued the Sentinels from the ambush. They subdued Squadron 7, but once again they were taken away; this time by aliens.</p><p>All the males of Sentinels were sent to prisons with power inhibitors on. Payens felt like it was his responsibility to get them out, even at the cost of his life. Another alien in an adjacent prison started to explain who the abductors were and how he believes the Sentinels could be the end of their tyranny. He sacrifices himself to let the Sentinels go and they head out. The guys head through hallways fighting aliens and dashing to save the girls, but when they arrive they are astonished to see slaughtered guards with Harlette in the middle.</p><p>The team comforts Harlette and regroup, and when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48614\" href=\"/crusher/4005-48614/\" slug=\"crusher\">Crusher</a> asks Firebomb about her baby the whole team is shocked, but especially Templar because it is in fact his. Crusher is enraged and attacks Templar only to be held back by the rest of the team. They manage to get their power inhibitors off and find Splash who had been wandering around on the planet surface.

    "deck": "Chuck Norris is an American martial artist champion, a Hollywood star, and he trained with Bruce Lee.",
    "description": "<p> </p><h2>Real Life</h2><p> </p><p>Origin/Early Life</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chuck Norris</strong> was born on March 10, 1940; his birth place was Ryan, <a href=\"/oklahoma/4020-55803/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55803\">Oklahoma</a>. His parents were, Wilma Scarberry (the mother) and Carlos Ray Norris (the father) who had several jobs which are bus driver/truck driver, and mechanic. Chuck's grandfather and grandmother were both from Ireland. Also Chuck's other grandparents were Native Americans, so in other words,<strong> Chuck Norris</strong> is half Irish and half Native American. Chuck's birth name was <strong><em>Carlos Ray Norris </em></strong>, before he changed it to Chuck Norris (a nick name that was given to him during his service in the Korean War) Chuck wasn't the only child though, he has two younger brothers, Weiland who now passed away (died heroically warning his troops of an enemy ambush) and Aaron who is a Hollywood director. Chuck learned the martial arts while stationed as an MP in <a href=\"/south-korea/4020-55932/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55932\">South Korea </a>. Chuck Norris is the only westerner to earn the 8th degree grand master black belt in Tae-Kwon-Do.</p><p>Chuck Norris was recently made an honorary Texas Ranger by the governor of <a href=\"/texas/4020-55822/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55822\">Texas</a>. Chuck has four children Dakota, Danilee, Kelly and Tim. He is married to Gena Norris.</p><p>Before acting Chuck ran Karate schools and has had some very high profile students including Michael Landon, (Little House Of the Prairie) the Osmonds, Bob Barker, and Steve McQueen. Chuck has starred in such films as, Delta Force, Delta Force 2, The Missing in Action Trilogy, Lone Wolf McQuade, Code of Silence and many other police movies. But his most famous role was that of Walker Texas Ranger, which is the main reason he was made an honorary Texas Ranger. The show lasted 8 seasons and CBS wanted it to end with 10, however do to the birth of twins Dakota, and Danilee he could not do it.</p><h2>Myths</h2><p>Many myth have spawned about the abilities of Chuck Norris. If he was a super powered actual superhero, than he would be quite powerful.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Chuck Norris myths revolve around him having incredible power and abilities.</p><p>Strength: Many of the myths are based on incredible strength. Like when he does push-ups, he's actually pushing the Earth down. Or how he can squeeze coal into diamond with his bare hands. That kind of strength is beyond almost any fictional character.</p><p>Speed: Chuck Norris also has some speed based myths. One such myth, likely the most popular speed based Chuck Norris myth, is that he can run around the world and punch himself in the back of the head. That is speed so great it literally defies physics in not just physics defying speed, but also defies physics in many other ways as well, although still purely based on speed.</p><p>Roundhouse Kick: Chuck Norris is said to possess incredibly powerful roundhouse kicks. Some of his roundhouse based myths are as follows:</p><ul><li>Chuck Norris's roundhouse kicks can make a man do 6 backflips from the sheer force.</li><li>Chuck Norris can roundhouse kick you yesterday.</li><li>Chuck Norris needs invincible pants so they don't explode off his body from the sheer force of his roundhouse kicks. These are called Chuck Norris Action Jeans.</li><li>Scientists have estimated that the force of the big bang is equal to one CNRK of force... one Chuck Norris roundhouse kick.</li></ul><p>Other Myths: Chuck Norris is also said to have not a chin beneath his beard, but just another fist. It is said that inside of Chuck Norris is a smaller but tougher Chuck Norris. Chuck Norris is said to be able to automatically have unlimited ammo with any gun he uses. Chuck Norris can transform into any animal he wishes, but he does this very rarely because the most dangerous animal is Chuck Norris. Chuck Norris once threw a grenade and killed 50 people. Then the grenade exploded. Chuck Norris was once bit by a king cobra and after 5 days of pain and agony, the cobra finally died.</p><p>This is only a small fraction of the myths based around Chuck Norris having superhuman abilities.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br/></h2><p>Fisher Todd worked with the Force Works team. He was hired as a technician for the now defunct superhero team. Starting out, Fisher attempted to help feel the only kid in the Force Works complex, Rachel Carpenter, at home. He showed her the base as well as the team's training facility the Vroom Room. However, the  room's programs were hacked and Rachel almost got hurt because of it. Only because of the timely intervention of Rachel's mother, the Spider-Woman, Rachel was kept from harm. <br/> <br/>In the month's that followed, Fisher showed attraction to Spider-Woman, but she never showed the  same interest in him. Eventually, due to circumstances involving Spider-Woman being manipulated, the two drew closer to each-other. However, they never became a couple. What happened to Fisher after Force Works was disbanded remains unknown.</p><p><br/></p>",

When summer vacation started Ben with on a road trip with his Grandfather <a href=\"../../maxwell-tennyson/29-49095/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Max Tennyson</a> and his cousin <a href=\"../../gwen-tennyson/29-55806/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gwendolyn Tennyson</a>. Meanwhile a ship being piloted by an <a href=\"../../aliens/12-46567/\" rel=\"nofollow\">alien</a> named <a href=\"../../xylene/29-50332/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xylene</a> was being attacked by another alien being named <a href=\"../../vilgax/29-50107/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vilgax</a>. Xylene was carrying an alien device called the <a href=\"../../omnitrix/18-53930/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Omnitrix, a</a>lthough we do not learn of Xylene's involvement with the Omnitrix until season 2. The Omnitrix has the power to turn any being into any other type pf life form who’s DNA is stored inside it. Xylene was forced to send the Omnitrix and herself down to Earth in an escape pod. She sent the Omnitrix to Earth but she was attacked getting into her own pond and wound up going to the arctic where she went into hibernation. Ben found the pod, once he did the Omnitrix latched onto his wrist and he couldn’t get it off. While trying to take it off he accidentally transformed into a fire powered alien he would name <a href=\"../../heatblast/29-53895/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heatblast</a>. After starting a fire by accident he told Max and Gwen what happen and Max (suspiciously) said he was an alien. While Ben was wondering how to turn back into a human the Omnitrix began to flash red and beep. He was soon turned back into his human form. Meanwhile, the heavily injured Vilgax is forced to spend some time in his regeneration pod to recover. He sends one of his robot probes to follow the last trace of the Omnitrix and retrieve it.</p><p>Back on Earth, Ben was playing with the Omnitrix and had become a giant dog-like creature. This form had no eyes but could see using echolocation and was agile and strong. Ben was soon attacked by the probes and he destroyed some but was about to be killed after he turned back human if not for Gwen beating it with a stick. Vilgax then sent a giant robot drone after Ben and it began attacking a trailer park. Ben then became a crystal like humanoid that was invulnerable and can turn its body it crystal like weapons. Ben would soon meet many enemies going on the road such as Doctor Animo, a mad geneticist who creates mutated animals and wants to take over the world, the Circus Freak Trio, Sixsix and more. Ben later meet a young mutant sociopath named <a href=\"../../kevin-11/29-49872/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kevin 11</a>. Kevin has the power to absorb different types of energy and use it as he sees fit. At first Ben and Kevin got along but Ben soon saw Kevin’s true side and during a fight Kevin found he could absorb the energy of the Omnitrix and partially become some of the alien life forms in the Omnitrix. Kevin was going to use his power to get revenge on some kids who bothered him but was stopped by Ben. Kevin tried to steal more of the Omnitrix’s power but couldn’t handle it and was blasted into a bridge that collapsed on top of him. He did survive however and had absorbed the powers of the watch. Gwen also had fun as a hero ( <a href=\"../../lucky-girl/29-48500/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucky Girl</a>) when she came across one of the Charms of Bezel, which gave her the power of incredibly good luck and first meet recurring villain <a href=\"../../hex/29-50139/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hex</a> who wanted all of the charms. Gwen was forced to destroy them however so Hex couldn’t have them. During one adventure were Ben was stuck in his Grey Matter form he was captured by an alien hunting nerd named</p><p>Howell Wayneright. Wayneright had intended to hand Ben over a group called The Forever Knights and their leader Enoch. Grandpa and Gwen tracked Ben down and with some help from the reformed Wayneright were able to free Ben. The Forever Knights would become recurring villains in the series. Ben would battle many more aliens until Vilgax appeared on Earth in a new stronger body while the gang was in <a href=\"../../washington-dc/34-55685/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Washington D.C.</a> Grandpa was acting suspicious the whole time and trying to keep Ben from fighting Ben would still battle some of Vilgax’s drones until he fought Vilgax himself. Vilgax was too strong for Ben and showed that he new a great many of the Omnitrix’s secrets, as he was able to turn Ben back into a human. Vilgax was angered that a child was giving him so much trouble. Vilgax captures Ben and Grandpa and Gwen enter a secret lair in Mount Rushmore to gather weapons to free Ben. Ben and his family defeat Vilgax and Ben tells grandpa he has some questions.</p><h2>Revelations</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2304991-ben10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2304991\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1153846153846\" data-width=\"364\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 364px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2304991-ben10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2304991\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2304991-ben10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2304991-ben10.jpg 364w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" data-width=\"573\"></a></figure><p>Grandpa reveals that he was once part of a group called the <a href=\"../../plumbers/65-57527/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plumbers</a>. They were an agency that fought against alien and supernatural forces and that Vilgax was and old enemy of his. They also meet and old Plumber friend of Max’s he has been setting the aliens that they Plumbers captured free so he can make a profit of there recapture. He was accidentally trapped in the Null Void, which is another dimension that Plumbers sent their prisoners to. Ben’s aliens are soon seen all over the country reeking havoc and stealing what ever they pleas. It turns out to be Kevin who has gain the power to turn any to any one of Ben’s aliens without the Omnitrix for however long he wants but he can’t change back and blames Ben for his condition. Because of the things Kevin has done Ben’s aliens are being hunted by soldiers being lead by Lieutenant Steel. Kevin soon turns into and an amalgam of all of Ben’s aliens and can’t turn back into his human self at all or there individual forms. He is soon shot off a bridge by an energy cannon fired by Steel’s men and falls into the ocean. Ben also gains a new alien he names Cannonbolt that can roll into a super hard ball that can spin incredibly fast when fighting a giant tick monster trying to drain Earth of its’ life force. This new form is essential for it’s defeat as Ben destroyed the Tick from the inside. Kevin later appears alive and well. He attacks Ben but isn’t quite as effective as even though he has all ten of Ben’s powers plus his own, Ben describes them as being only one tenth the strength of his powers. The two are soon captured by an alien named Slix Vigma who captures different species and makes them fight. The two are forced to team up but soon are at odds once they defeat their Slix who turns out to be a robot that is one with the whole ship they are on. After they defeat Vigma and many of the other prisoners escape Kevin turns on Ben. Ben transforms into Cannonbolt because Kevin has seen him and doesn’t know how his powers work. Ben is also helped by Technorg another alien who Ben saved from Kevin and helps Ben due to a code of honor. As Ben escapes Technorg stays with Kevin intending to make their stay on the ship as painful as possible. Ben would soon meet a group of alien heroes called The <a href=\"../../galactic-enforcers/65-55861/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Galactic Enforcers</a> when they helped him stop Sixsix and his new ally Vulkanus. He would transform into a new alien called <a href=\"../../wildvine/29-70933/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wildvine</a> when battling an evil giant fungus. The gang would also fight The Forever Knights again when they tried to find an ancient powerful sword called the Sword of Ekchuah. Max becomes obsessed with finding the sword, but is relieved when he sees that the sword has become brittle and became dust once taken from its resting place. Gwen would also become Lucky Girl again after finding the Keystone of Bezel, which increased her natural abilities. She also fought Hex and his niece <a href=\"../../charmcaster/29-49094/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charmcaster</a>. Hex wanted to use the keystone to bring back the other charms, but was stopped by Gwen, Ben and Grandpa. Ben would soon lose control of his alien form of <a href=\"../../ghostfreak/29-53370/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ghostfreak</a>. Ghostfreak revealed that his species' consciousness lives in every piece of DNA and that he was trapped in the Omnitrix and wanted out. Once escaped he took on his true form but was revealed to be weak against sunlight and needed to merge with Ben to fix that. He used the Freakshow Trio to try and do it, but was destroyed by Ben. Kevin would soon return to Earth after finding Vilgax frozen in ice in space. Meanwhile Ben had accidentally activated a master control on the Omnitrix that allowed him to be any of his forms with a thought, could go to one form to the next, and wasn’t timing out. Ben was giving the two of them a hard time, but grandpa didn’t think he could stop the two soon he went to get the Null Void projector which he kept with him after they left D.C. He tried to trap the two in the Null Void, but Ben got sucked along as well and it was up to Gwen to save him. Vilgax took her and Ben gave him the Omnitrix, but not before Ben reset it back to the way it was, but Vilgax assured him he could reset the control, but was double-crossed by Kevin. However Ben and Gwen was able to leave the two trapped in the Null Void and brought the Omnitrix out with them.</p><h2>Back To The Future</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2548042\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75555555555556\" data-width=\"720\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2548042\"><img alt=\"Ben 10,000\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 720w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ben 10,000\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 720w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2548042-ben_10k.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ben 10,000</figcaption></figure><p>Ben and Gwen soon meet future versions of themselves from twenty years.

They also fight an alien mummy planning to steal an alien mineral called Corrodium that is a powerful energy source, but can mutate other beings. Ben stops the mummy, but not before absorbing its DNA into the Omnitrix. The Tennysons soon find out that a space shuttle has been delayed due to purple lightning, the same kind that appeared when the werewolf and mummy showed up. They soon find that the alien werewolf has freed the mummy and that they are working with an evil alien version of Frankenstein named Viktor and that their plan is to resurrect their true leader, Ghostfreak. After bringing back Ghostfreak the Tennysons find out that Ghostfreak plans to use the Corrodium to block out the sun and mutate the Earth so he can rule. However after absorbing Viktor’s DNA the family is able to stop Ghostfreak’s plan and destroy him once again by exposing him to sunlight while they were in space. When Ben returns to Earth he sees that the Omnitrix has absorbed Ghostfreak's DNA again and that his return will eventually come.

Its activation alerts Tetrax (known as Hoverboard in \"Hunted\"), who travels to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip. Gwen sneaks on board anyway.</p><p>Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant. She switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. He also refused to give her the abort sequence for the self-destruct, which as she explains will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants; including Earth itself. Regardless, Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to his home planet.</p><p>While attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax, who has somehow escaped the Null Void and has commandeered a ship to track down Ben. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though the pilot, a slime alien named Gluto, is killed in the conflict. Tetrax's ship crashes on Azmuth's home world. As they enter his mountain fortress, they are attacked by a group of Florauna which apparently eat Gwen, something Ben doesn't take too well. As Ben proceeds with the other two aliens down towards Azmuth's lair, Tetrax empathizes with Ben, revealing his origins of how working for Vilgax cost him his whole planet and everyone he's ever cared for. Tracking down Azmuth to a sealed secondary laboratory, Ben asks him to shut down the Omnitrix, but he refuses. As far as he's concerned, the universe deserves its fate for misusing his creation, which he explains was meant to help understand the various species in the universe, not turn them into weapons. Angry, Ben breaks down the wall with Cannonbolt and attacks him, revealing Azmuth to be an old, curmudgeonly Galvan hiding inside a large mechanical suit.</p><p>Vilgax, having recovered from his earlier defeat, leads a massive attack on Azmuth's mountain fortress. Gwen is revealed to have survived, Gluto having regenerated from some leftover material that splashed on her clothes and subsequently helped her to escape, which causes Ben to break down in tears and embrace her in a hug. Ben's actions during the battle renew Azmuth's faith in the universe, so he repairs the Omnitrix and gives Ben a brand-new form to use: Way Big, a skyscraper-sized alien modeled after tokusatsu superheroes. He easily repels Vilgax's army of drones and tosses the villain into space.</p><p>With the threat over, Ben offers to return the Omnitrix to Azmuth, since it does belong to him. Azmuth, however, sees Ben as the best place for the Omnitrix to be, both because he is technically fulfilling its original intention and because the Omnitrix attracts trouble simply by virtue of its existence. Tetrax returns Ben and Gwen to Earth, leaving Ben with a new hoverboard to replace the one Ben destroyed during his battle with Animo. Ben suggests taking a trip to the mall to please Gwen, but an announcement about the mall being attacked by zombies disrupts the occasion. Gwen simply states that this is a normal day for them and they all head off.</p><h2>Race Against Time</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2548039\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"220\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 220px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2548039\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg 220w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2548039-220px_ben_10_race_against_time_poster.jpg 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In Bellwood, a mysterious figure teleports into town, and immediately starts destroying things. Ben Tennyson , in the form of Heatblast, confronts him. After a short battle, Ben seemingly obliterates the villain. The next day, Ben goes back to school, and has trouble adjusting to normal life again. After a bad day, he and Gwen Tennyson go over some yearbook photos she took. In the background of one with Ben, Gwen enhances a blurred spot and reveals the same villain Ben defeated earlier. Max Tennyson identifies him as Eon , an alien the Plumbers captured almost two centuries ago. When he arrived, he was half dead and brought a device with him called the Hands of Armageddon, which would open a time rift to the alien's home dimension and unleash his race upon Earth if activated. They travel to the containment facility where Eon is supposed to be kept, only to find it empty and his guardian aged to near-death.</p><p>Traveling back to Bellwood, Max takes Ben and Gwen to the location of the Hands of Armageddon, guarded by the few remaining Plumbers including Principal White and other people Ben and Gwen known. Eon has them followed and breaks into the facility, but cannot activate the device. When Ben attempts to use the Omnitrix, it malfunctions, glowing and refusing to activate. Eon attempts to kidnap Ben, claiming it to be a rescue, but Ben escapes. Eon manages to corner Ben, explaining that his race learned to control time itself, but trapped themselves by misusing their power. He claims that his fate is intertwined with Ben's. Eon is scared off by an old man who happens to be another Plumber before he can elaborate. Grandpa Max decides it would be best for Ben to leave Bellwood so that Eon won't find him, but Ben bravely refuses and they both come to a deal where Ben will be monitored daily by a Plumber in disguise.</p><p>The Plumbers, all around town, guard Ben around the clock. When Ben goes to the school gym to be alone, Principal White attempts to calm Ben's fears just when Eon arrives again and shoves White out of the way. This time, Ben is able to become Diamondhead and fight him off. Later on that day, Ben decides to lure Eon into a trap by purposefully leaving himself open, but this backfires and he is captured along with Gwen and Max.</p><p>At the Plumber facility storing the Hands of Armageddon, Eon explains some of the background of the Omnitrix: Ben can only remain in his alien forms for ten minutes at a time, a failsafe to prevent them from overwhelming his personality. Eon knows how to deactivate the failsafe, and in doing so can resurrect himself through the Omnitrix. He does so, and Ben is transformed into a younger version of Eon. The older one retreats since there are now two of him. Reborn, Eon activates the Hands of Armageddon. Gwen and Max manage to free themselves and work to stop him. While Max tries to disable the time rift, potentially at the cost of his own life, Gwen appeals to Ben inside Eon. Ben successfully overcomes Eon, and with the help of the other Plumbers manages to save Max and disable the time rift, sending Eon's race back to their own dimension.</p><p>Just when it seems like they've won, time stops for everyone but Ben. The older Eon reappears, angered at Ben's victory. Ben transforms into Wildmutt and fights him off, eventually knocking him into the Hands of Armageddon, destroying them both. After doing an impromptu magic trick for the school talent show, using Wildmutt's timely de-transformation and a well placed stage curtain, Ben finally accepts being just Ben for a while. However, Max points out that aliens are persistent, and as the film ends an alien ship flies towards Earth.</p><h2><b>Alien Force</b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543042\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0457516339869\" data-width=\"306\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 306px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543042\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" data-width=\"306\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg 306w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543042-ben10alienforce.jpg 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" data-width=\"306\"></noscript></a></figure><p>It has been five years since Ben has used the Omnitrix. He has become a normal teenager, dealing with Girls, sports and school. He goes to Grandpa Max to show him a new medal that he got playing soccer. He walks into the new Rust Bucket, finding it wrecked. He looks around to find a DNAlien (Human/Alien hybrid) prowling around the Rust Bucket. Ben fights him off (without the Omnitrix) and finds a message from Grandpa Max. With the fear that Max is in danger, Ben puts the Omnitrix back on. He and Gwen find Kevin making a deal with the DNAliens and the Forever Knights. Magister Labrid steps in and talks to them about the Highbreed, who think they are better than everyone else. In the fight against the Highbreed, Magister Labrid is killed and tells them that they need to work together to win. Ben, Gwen and Kevin set off to find Grandpa Max finding clues that he has left for them. Ben and Kevin have their problems (mainly when Kevin takes the Rust Bucket.) But Ben and Kevin settle their differences.</p><p>The recent message from Max was to locate the Plumbers' Kids (via the Plumber Badges.) Kevin has one of these badges which hints that he is a Plumber's kid. Ben encounters an alien named Albedo, who claims he is the true creator of the Omnitrix and he needs Ben's Omnitrix to override his own Omnitrix since he got stuck in a clone Ben form (but they look different). Ben and Albedo clash until Azmuth arrives stating Albedo was an assistant. Albedo is then sent off to the Null Void prison after Azmuth removes his central core.</p><p>Ben assembles a team made up of Cooper, Azmuth, Albright, Darkstar, Julie and Ship and Paradox along with Kevin and Gwen to stop the Highbreed's take over. Ben and his team successfully defeat the Highbreed, and as a result Ben becomes famous all throughout the Galaxy. Vilgax returned upon hearing of this and challenged Ben to a fight. Ben accepted. In order to fight Vilgax, Ben tried to hack the Omnitrix's master control, which caused a feedback pulse and a release of a few aliens which Ben recaptured.

He shares a deeper bond with Julie and has become better friends with Kevin. Ben now has a car. Ben battles a news reporter named William Harangue. A new alien enemy named Aggregor appears. He is an Osmosian like Kevin and he wishes to find the Map of Infinity and he absorbs the power of 5 aliens which Ben has tried to save. Aggregor continuously seems to trump Ben and inside the Forge of Creation, Ben is defeated. It is Kevin who absorbs Ben's powers and he defeats Aggregor, but this turns Kevin insane and he leaves. Ben and Gwen continue on a task to find Kevin, Ben and Kevin eventually clash but it is Ben who defeats Kevin and along with Cooper and Morningstar's help, they cure Kevin.</p><p>Ben encounters Eon once again and with the help of Ben 10,000 they defeat Eon. Ben is warned by Paradox to beware of Old George (who is St George, one who has had many stories told about him, as well as the founder of the Forever Knights). Ben is now in a fight against the Forever Knights once again. Ben has gone on several other missions. Ben has saved the Arachnichimp home world from a DNAlien-possessed Arachnichimp named Mizaru. He encountered Albedo again who was using his fame to make a theater-like show to gain money and try to fix himself out of Ben's form. He fought a few Ultimate Aliens in his watch who developed into sentient beings instead of the blank slates like they should be. He fought Generator Rex and had a few more encounters with the Forever Knights. Ben discovered Vilgax is alive and is mistaken for a false god named Diagon and is housed by a group called the Esoterica. Diagon abducted Vilgax who stole Old George's power to try and regain his own power, but Old George got the power back upon touching his sword. Now Ben is set to encounter Diagon if Old George fails. If Old George is to fall in battle then Ben will take Old George's sword which was an artifact made by Azmuth centuries ago, and must defeat Diagon.</p><h3>Generator Rex</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543040\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56258992805755\" data-width=\"695\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 695px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543040\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 695w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 695w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2543040-heroes_united_opening.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>According to Ben, he was at a celebrity gig when a strange storm picked him up and dumped him into Rex's world, where he mistook Rex for an alien attempting to destroy Bellwood. However, he was also mistaken for an EVO, who Rex tried to cure, but both found that they were not what the other thought they were. \"Captured\", Ben was taken back to Rex's with an unconscious Agent Six following a battle with an unknown enemy he had been chasing through the storm. While in the base, Ben learned of what was going on in that world, becoming confused by some facts, but generally grasping things are not going good. Deciding to team up with Rex, Ben met Caesar, Rex' brother and learned that he had banished the Alpha nanite to the null void, thinking it was an empty dimension. However, Alpha had returned and planned to use the Ultimatrix's energies to upgrade itself into a perfect being; Ben turned into Upgrade and fused with Rex, allowing them to use more powerful versions of Rex's weapons to beat down Alpha. With Caesar's help, Ben entered the Null Void as a stop on the way back home.</p><h2>Omniverse</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3851000\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.8274111675127\" data-width=\"394\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 394px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:182.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3851000\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-width=\"350\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg 394w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg 350w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg 394w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65067/3851000-ben+10+%283%29.jpg 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-width=\"350\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In this series Ben has a new Omnitrix an a new alien partner Rook Blonko. Gwen has gone to college and Kevin has joined her so then Ben wanted to go solo. He soon learns of an alien protection racked in Bellwood so he attempts to do something about it. He goes to Mr. Baumann's store and learns that aliens are using what are called \"shake down devices\" to level establishments that don't pay. It's there that Ben meets his new alien partner and manage to save Baumann's store, but not before destroying some of it. Rook and Ben who is hesitant to take on a new partner soon chase them to a place called Undertown. It's an entire secret city of aliens under Bellwood. The culprit behind this is revealed to be Vilgax's former lackey Psyphon. Along the way though Ben encounters old foes as well as some new ones like the hunter called Khyber, Dr. Psychobos who is a mutant version of the alien species, Ben calls Brainstorm, but it is revealed Ben had a rogue Galvanic Mechamorph called Malware for an enemy.</p><p> </p><p>He was responsible for destroying one of Ben's most prized transformations, Feedback. Many of Ben's older aliens like Stinkfly and Greymatter return. The Halloween Trio get names: Benwolf becomes Blitzwolfer, Benmummy becomes Snare-Oh, and Benviktor becomes Frankenstrike. However Ben also unlocked new aliens like Shocksquatch, Crashhopper, and Gravattack. Also many fan favorite villains from many different series have returned like Dr. Animo, Albedo, and Vilgax, but also Zs'Skayr and Doctor Viktor returned.</p><p> </p><p>In the episode \"So Long and Thanks for All the Smoothies\", the universe is destroyed and so then Ben as Alien X simply builds another universe that was just like the old one. Another major storyline is that Earth was taken over by the Incursean Empire. Ben was defeated and exiled into space where his sentence was death, but he had an unlikely ally. Azmuth also gave him his Incursean transformation which allowed him to return to Earth and save it thus ending the Incursean rule and saving Earth yet again. When Albedo returned he recreated the Ultimatrix and attempted to take over the universe by stealing Azmuth's intelligence, but he was stopped. Gwen and Kevin do make occasional appearances now, but they are simply minor recurring characters now. Max Tennyson is a part of Ben's team again and has been in nearly every episode.</p><h2>Alternate Universe Versions</h2><p>There is one universe, featured in the episode titled <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ben-10-204-gwen-10/4070-6514/\" data-ref-id=\"4070-6514\">Gwen 10</a> in which Ben never gets the Omnitrix.

His body is composed of extremely sharp and durable green crystals. He wears a uniform similar to Ben's clothing which is black on one half and white on the other. He also sports 4 green crystal points on his back and has a sharp head. He has an overall square body design. His eyes are yellow in color, and his Omnitrix/Ultimatrix symbol is on the left of his chest. His name is derived from diamond, a super hard substance originated from coal and \"head\" the top of his body.</p><p>Diamondhead's species have super dense bodies which are composed of extremely dense organic green and purple crystals, making him nearly invulnerable. He is able to manipulate the atomic structure of his crystalline structure and physiology at will, thus allowing him to make crude crystal weapons from any part of his body on demand, and fire crystals rapidly from his hands. He can make huge clusters of crystals, by creating crystal shields, and even make ramps for himself to jump on. In certain ways, he can even reshape his projectiles into certain shapes and can make giant body parts like hands to capture enemies. His crystalkinetic powers don't end there, as he can control the crystals that are not even connected to his body redirecting them. The same ability also allows him to regenerate to a limited extent, such as growing severed or lost limbs. In addition to growing crystals on himself, he can also grow them over other objects. In addition, to his crystalkinetic powers his crystal body itself acts as a living prism, making lasers and weapons similar useless refracting the beams. He also has proved strong enough to easily beat Kevin, defeat Vilgax.</p><p><b>XLR8</b><b>:</b> XLR8 is a Kineceleran that resembles a semi-armored velociraptor.

This enables him to phase through anything and turn invisible at will. He may have only one eye, but he can position it anywhere on his body by using a track traced along his skin. His appearance can also bring fear in the hearts of others, sometimes, even Ben is creeped out. Ghostfreak can also peel back his own skin, which reveals a horrifying mass of tentacles, which is seen in The Big Tick and Last Laugh. Direct sunlight and chemicals that can affect his body will nullify his invisibility and intangibility. He is a last resort method.</p><p>Ghostfreak's fully developed form is truly more menacing than the Omnitrix form. He actually has a skull head, and it's upside down. His tentacles, hidden underneath the first form, are revealed. Spikes grew on his shoulders and through one half of his arms. In this form, Ghostfreak now has claws instead of hands. The skin he had in his Omnitrix form is presumably a safety feature incorporated by the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, both to safeguard this alien forms exposure to sunlight and to lessen the frightful impact of its true hideous appearance. This is substantiated by the fact that Ghostfreak willingly ripped it off, despite it being daylight at the time, in order to reveal his true appearance; the true nature of this skin, however, is never fully explained in the series beyond its sun-shielding capabilities.</p><p>Ghostfreaks original powers were limited to intangibility and invisibility (accompanied by a inverted color scheme and transparency). It has been explained that he can control his density. He has been shown to be able to change into a smoke like form in Hunted. Ghostfreak can also peel back his own skin, which reveals his horrifying true form, this has been used to terrify Zombozo, fight the giant tick, and as a way for Ghostfreaks inner self to free itself. The original Ghostfreak was grated a second layer of skin to make him usable in sunlight(at the cost of eliminating many of his powers) it is also meant for extreme combat.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3551192\" data-ratio=\"0.75433070866142\" data-width=\"635\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 635px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3551192\"><img alt=\"Wildmutt\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 635w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wildmutt\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 635w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551192-2698701300-635px.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wildmutt</figcaption></figure><p><b>Wildmutt</b> is a Vulpimancer that has a body shape that appears to be a cross between a lion, a wolf and a gorilla.

However Heatblast used the meltdown skill by raising his body temperature to the point where the mud creatures eventually turned to stone, allowing Heatblast to break out from their stomache.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3551199\" data-ratio=\"0.85643564356436\" data-width=\"404\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 404px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:85.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3551199\"><img alt=\"Stinkfly\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png 404w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Stinkfly\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png 404w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551199-9304558410-16_St.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stinkfly</figcaption></figure><p>In any situation requiring flight, <b>Stinkfly</b> is Ben's alien of choice.

While merged with a device, Upgrade controls it as he would his own body. Even without a machine at hand, Upgrade can reconfigure his form around his eye in order to fire a plasma beam from it.

Cannonbolt can roll into a ball like an armadillo or pill bug to encase itself in this plating. There is enough space within the shell while rolled up to protect and transport people or objects. When in the form of a rolled-up ball, Cannonbolt can increase its rotational momentum and roll into enemies as an attack, as well as ricocheting himself off surfaces.</p><p>Cannonbolt demonstrated his extremely tough plates in Ben 10: Secret of The Omnitrix when he broke through three electric, metal doors in order to get to Azmuth, the creator of the Omnitrix.

By spinning in the same spot rapidly it can create a tornado like XLR8 and Terraspin .</p><p>Cannonbolt's armored shell is a defensive mechanism that is extremely resilient (but because of Ben's creativeness he has adapted this to attacks).</p><p>The shell is durable enough to survive a free fall from the upper limits of the Earth's atmosphere and including the heat of atmospheric re-entry, and still leave Cannonbolt and anything held inside the ball intact, though the landing still creates some pain due to the large crater left there.

Also, if one clone is killed, the others are automatically killed as well, thus negating the ability to form many clones. If one of the clones is separated from the others by a great distance, then when the Omnitrix times out, the wearer will not transform back into normal, or be able to become another alien until all the clones are brought back into one.

In the episode, after some continued fight, Ben's Omnitrix is scratched(with no damage on it) by the Lobon thought to be the Yenadooshi. The Omnitrix was somehow stuck between Capture Mode and Active Mode, and as a result, the transformation is gradual instead of instantaneous (like a werewolf).</p><p>Blitzwolfer is very muscular, tall, has dog-like back legs, stands on his back legs, and has a face and muzzle that looks like a Mexican wolf's face and muzzle. He also has many animal-like tendencies. Blitzwolfer has enhanced strength, speed and agility; supposedly being able to lift approximately 500 lbs and run over 70 mph. In addition to Blitzwolfer's formidable claws, fangs, and muscles, he can emit an ultrasonic howl if the parts of his quadra-hinged muzzle is opened and a shout is let out. He can also do a jump attack by using his claws to slash the air.</p><p><b>Snare-oh's</b> appearance differs slightly from the other Thep Khufans. His eyes and the gaps between its bandages glow green instead of purple. Snare-oh also has black bracers and greaves, as well as a smaller mask and the Omnitrix symbol on his left shoulder. Snare-oh can speak, even though the other Khufan that attacked Ben seems to be mute. In originial series, Ben didn't know how to use Snare-oh's powers when he turned into this alien.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3551219\" data-ratio=\"0.68062827225131\" data-width=\"382\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 382px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3551219\"><img alt=\"Snare-oh (formally known as Benmummy)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG 382w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Snare-oh (formally known as Benmummy)\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG 382w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111121983/3551219-6697463169-Benmu.PNG 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Snare-oh (formally known as Benmummy)</figcaption></figure><p>Similar to those used on Egyptian mummies, Snare-oh is also covered in many bandages. This allows Thep Khufans to reshape their bodies at will, splitting themselves apart to dodge attacks and reforming to counter- attack. To compensate for its relatively weak form, these aliens can recover from basically any injury, including being torn into confetti by a large fan, almost instantly and with no visible repercussions. When Ben first uses the form, he had trouble figuring out how to control it; Ben quickly discovers how to stretch his bandages, but has not displayed knowledge of the advanced reshaping techniques yet. Snare-oh can also use his bandages as some sort of tentacles which allows him to grab his enemies and throw them with ease with out the use of his super strength. Snare-oh's bandages make him extremely light, allowing him to be thrown by beings with human strength or blown away by strong enough winds. Despite his build, however, Snare-oh is still incredibly strong. In addition to strength, Snare-oh also has a surprising amount of speed and agility, enough to scale walls and dodge attacks with relative ease. His composition also allows him to survive in a vacuum. This is probably due to the fact that his body is made of fibers that come from the shell-like head. The head is the only \"true\" part of the creature.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3551229\" data-ratio=\"1.885\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:188.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3551229\"><img alt=\"Frankenstrike( formally known as Benvictor)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Frankenstrike( formally known as Benvictor)\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/3551229-0557252823-Benvi.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Frankenstrike( formally known as Benvictor)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Frankenstrike</strong> can generate \"green\" (unlike like the normal purple of the species) electricity and manipulate the resulting energy to attack enemies or adhere himself to metal through magnetism.

    "description": "<h2>Biography</h2><p>In the years leading up to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56753\" href=\"/yinchorri/4060-56753/\">Yinchorri</a> Uprisng, Choi took <a data-ref-id=\"4005-68849\" href=\"/theen-fida/4005-68849/\">Theen Fida</a> as his Padawan. In 33 BBY, Choi volunteered to go to Yitheeth as part of a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\" href=\"/jedi/4015-52199/\">Jedi</a> task force consisting of himself, Theen Fida, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5401\" href=\"/adi-gallia/4005-5401/\">Adi Gallia</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5402\" href=\"/eeth-koth/4005-5402/\">Eeth Koth</a>. While on board a Consular-class cruiser, the four Jedi crash-landed on the oceanic world of Yitheeth—fortunately, both Choi and Fida were skilled swimmers. Once the Jedi had regrouped, they returned to their mission, which was to find the Yinchorri head quarters—however, after a skirmish with some Yinchorri warriors, they realized the HQ was not on the planet, and that they had walked into an enemy ambush.</p><p>Choi and the other Jedi managed to fight their way through the ambush and find transport off the planet. The four Jedi then traveled to the nearby planet of Yibikkoror, where Micah Giett, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5403\" href=\"/plo-koon/4005-5403/\">Plo Koon</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64330\" href=\"/lilit-twoseas/4005-64330/\">Lilit Twoseas</a> and her Padawan <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57907\" href=\"/kkruhk/4005-57907/\">K'Kruhk</a> were carrying out a similar mission as that of Tsui. The two groups of Jedi met, and set a course for Yinchorr, where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\" href=\"/mace-windu/4005-5395/\">Mace Windu</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5411\" href=\"/qui-gon-jinn/4005-5411/\">Qui-Gon Jinn</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\" href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5404\" href=\"/saesee-tiin/4005-5404/\">Saesee Tiin</a> were busy holding off a massive Yinchorri attack. Tsui and the other Jedi joined the fight, and during the ensuing battle, Theen Fida was killed by the Yinchorri. Tsui caught Holmar Grahrk trying to steal a Consular-class cruiser to escape Yinchorr, and discovered that Holmar was working in unison with his cousin, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64128\" href=\"/vilmarh-grahrk/4005-64128/\">Vilmarh Grahrk</a>. Choi later attended the funeral of his Padawan on Coruscant, who, along with Lilit Twoseas and Micah Giett, had died defending the Republic.</p><p>Tsui went on to become a General during the Clone Wars, leading Red Squadron into battle during the Defense of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55722\" href=\"/kamino/4020-55722/\">Kamino</a>. The Jedi's battle plan assigned Tsui's squadron with the task of taking on the attacking Droid fighters, while Blue Squadron, under the command of Obi-Wan Kenobi, attacked incoming troop transports. During the battle, Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64331\" href=\"/kossex/4005-64331/\">Kossex</a> of Red Squadron was shot down and was killed instantly.</p><p>Later in the war, Master Choi was one of several Jedi who were on the Republic Troopship VCD987. While <i>en route</i> to the planet Drongar, VCD987 came under attack by an immensely superior Separatist force and sustained massive damage to its engines—with the engines no longer functioning, Separatist troops, under the leadership of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5392\" href=\"/count-dooku/4005-5392/\">Count Dooku</a>, boarded the ship and cornered Tsui, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64392\" href=\"/kai-justiss/4005-64392/\">Kai Justiss</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57930\" href=\"/sian-jeisel/4005-57930/\">Sian Jeisel</a>. In an attempt to appear merciful and thus sway Jedi to the Separatist cause, Dooku allowed the captured Jedi to go free, instead choosing to only kill the clones which were aboard the ship instead.</p><p>During the Battle of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-45962\" href=\"/kashyyyk/4020-45962/\">Kashyyyk</a> coordinated by Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5396\" href=\"/yoda/4005-5396/\">Yoda</a>, Tsui Choi and a team of Aleenan scouts performed reconnaissance missions riding can-cells through the wild terrains of the planet.</p><p>Tsui Choi survived <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55868\" href=\"/order-66/4015-55868/\">Order 66</a>, and managed to evade and kill his clone trooper commander, and a squad of clone troopers, on Eriadu during the first month of the Great Jedi Purge. He was eventually reunited with fellow Jedi survivor <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53771\" href=\"/bultar-swan/4005-53771/\">Bultar Swan</a>, and engineered a rendezvous on Kessel with six other Jedi survivors. The other Jedi, particularly <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53746\" href=\"/koffi-arana/4005-53746/\">Koffi Arana</a>, wanted to strike back at <a data-ref-id=\"4005-16164\" href=\"/emperor-palpatine/4005-16164/\">Palpatine</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\" href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\">Darth Vader</a>, but Tsui disagreed, refusing to go down the path which would lead to the dark side. However, Tsui was shocked to learn that Master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54023\" href=\"/shadday-potkin/4005-54023/\">Shadday Potkin</a> had leaked information to Darth Vader that Obi-Wan Kenobi would be present at the Conclave. Tsui originally didn't want to fight Vader, but after Sian-Lan Wezz was killed, he told Bultar he had no other choice, and threw himself into the battle. During the ensuing fight, he managed to slice off Vader's robotic hand with his lightsaber. Despite losing his hand, Vader managed to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53921\" href=\"/sia-lan-wezz/4005-53921/\">Sia-Lan Wezz</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54020\" href=\"/makis-shaalas/4005-54020/\">Ma'kis'shaalas</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53746\" href=\"/koffi-arana/4005-53746/\">Koffi Arana</a> abd Shadday Potkin. Although many Jedi were lost, Tsui, along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53915\" href=\"/roblio-darte/4005-53915/\">Roblio Darte</a> amd <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53932\" href=\"/jastus-farr/4005-53932/\">Jastus Farr</a>, used the force to launch a barrage of boulders at the Dark Lord.</p><p>With Vader outmaneuvered and apparently outnumbered, Tsui was left with no choice but to strike down the fallen Jedi. However, before he could do so, Imperal <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56620\" href=\"/stormtroopers/4060-56620/\">stormtroopers</a> arrived. Initially, Tsui was able to block their shots, and Roblio Darte shielded himself with a piece of rubble. Tsui leapt up to the balcony where the troopers were standing, but before he could cut them down, Vader used a force grip on him, holding him in mid-air. Tsui, knowing that he was close to death, launched one last attack against Vader by throwing his lightsaber at Vader, cutting a hole in his helmet. Immediately thereafter, Tsui was gunned down by the stormtroopers, and Vader released his Force Grip allowing the body to fall to the ground.</p><p>When the Galactic Empire emerged, \"official\" records compiled by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53770\" href=\"/emperor-pestage/4005-53770/\">Sate Pestage</a> stated that Choi was executed for illegal spice trafficking.</p>",

In his first story, he is shown wandering the Earth in search of gathering followers through magical, Tesla-like instruments. The followers lose their awareness of the world and there is an impression that the all has collapsed and that the apocalypse has come. After this, Nyarlathotep is reputedly depicted as the harbinger of the earth's end.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71902/1342022-nyarlethotep__by_lee_gibbons_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1342022\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 300px\" data-ratio=\"1.15\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71902/1342022-nyarlethotep__by_lee_gibbons_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1342022\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71902/1342022-nyarlethotep__by_lee_gibbons_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71902/1342022-nyarlethotep__by_lee_gibbons_.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a></figure><p>Nyarlathotep is a major character in the story \"The Dream-Quest Of Unknown Kadath\" in which he manifests into the form of an Egyptian Pharaoh and confronts the character Randolph Carter. In \"The Dreams In The Witch House\" (1933), he appears to Walter Gilman and the witch Keziah Mason in the form of the 'Black Man', a black-skinned form of the Devil. He is also mentioned in \"The Rats In The Walls\" as a faceless god in Earth's center. Furthermore, <br />\"The Haunter of The Dark\" showcases a bat-winged, three-eyed monster in the steeple of a cult-church that is said to be Nyarlathotep.</p><p>Whereas most Outer Gods are ambivalent to, or unaware of humanity's existance, Nyarlathotep is unique in that he delights in causing suffering to humans.</p><p>It has been suggested that Stephen King's <a href=\"/randall-flagg/4005-51448/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51448\">Randall Flag</a> is among the avatars of Nyarlathotep.</p><h3>Powers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71902/1339249-mr_arkham_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1339249\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 435px\" data-ratio=\"1.5379310344828\" data-width=\"435\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71902/1339249-mr_arkham_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1339249\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71902/1339249-mr_arkham_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/71902/1339249-mr_arkham_2.jpg 435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" data-width=\"435\"></a></figure><p>Nyarlathotep is an omnipotent demonic deity.

When Mark revealed he had taken no steps towards the domination of Earth, Anissa decides to reason with him instead of using violence. She explains that the Viltrumite empire will bring peace to Earth and share their technology with one another. When reason fails, Anissa resorts to violence and strikes mark down leaving him in a crater. She warns him of another viltrumite agent will return for Mark in the later future and decide his fate, that agent turned out to be <a href=\"/conquest/4005-61561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61561\">Conquest</a>.

    "deck": "Tidus is a blitzball player from Zanarkand who was transported 1,000 years into the future by a creature named Sin. He is the son of the famous retired Blitzball hero, Jecht. He also hates his father beacuse he was always put down as a kid. He is 19 yrs old",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2> <br/> <h3>Zanarkand's Blitzball Superstar</h3> <p>Tidus first appears when he is talking to fans and signing autographs before his big Blitzball game. He runs to his Blitzball game and while he’s there the evil entity known as Sin attacks. Tidus then wakes up on the ground and starts to run to escape Sin. While running he notices Auron, his mentor. They run and defeat a few enemies along the way but get stuck in a corner when they get surrounded by enemies. Auron then tells Tidus to cut the big gas tank next to them. They manage to cut the gas tank and when it hit the floor it exploded sending a building in front of them crashing down. They run over the building. Auron managed to make it over, but Tidus managed to grab the ledge of the still standing building. Auron then stands there talking to Sin and picks up Tidus and they both get sent into the future.</p> <p>Tidus wakes up in the ruins of a forgotten temple. He swims over to the ruins for shelter. While swimming he encounters a few fiends. He quickly defeats them but a giant fiend comes and starts to attack Tidus. Knowing he can’t win, he swims quickly to the ruins. He almost gets swallowed with his legs inside the creature’s mouth but he gets inside the ruins in time. Tidus then finds the remains of a fire. He then goes around trying to find something he can use. He manages to find flint and tinder to make the fire. With his need satisfied he holds his stomach saying he needs food. During that time a fiend attacks him and he pulls out his sword getting ready to fight. After a few hits a group of Al Bhed blow open the doors to the ruins and one of them help out Tidus. After they defeat the fiend the girl that was helping him knocked him out.</p> <p>Tidus then wakes up on a ship and the Al Bhed tries to talk to him but Tidus doesn’t understand the language their speaking. The girl translates. Tidus then decides to work. Tidus and the unknown girl go and dive into the ocean to find some ruins beneath them that might still have some power left in it. They swim inside and when they get to the center they find the power source and turn it on. While leaving the ruins they get attacked by an octopus looking kind of fiend. They beat it using grenades and sword attacks.</p> <p>When they get back to the ship Tidus feels exhausted after battling with no food. The girl then comes and gives Tidus some food to eat. Tidus then asks what the girl’s name is. She says her name is<a data-ref-id=\"4005-47409\" href=\"/rikku/4005-47409/\" slug=\"rikku\"> Rikku</a>. Tidus then feels overjoyed that she can really understand him. Rikku then asks where Tidus comes from. He says Zanarkand and Rikku acts shocked and says that Zanarkand was destroyed 1 thousand years ago. Tidus then tells Rikku everything that happened before he met her. Rikku then explains everything to Tidus. Rikku then went inside the ship and Tidus thinks about what Rikku told him. He then thinks that Rikku isn’t telling the truth. Before he could finish thinking, Sin attacked their ship. Tidus fell off the ship and into a vortex that was right beside the ship. </p> <p>  </p> <h3>Arrival In Besaid</h3> <p>Tidus woke up face first in the water and started to cough because of all the water. Tidus then got hit on the head with a blitzball and someone ashore asked if he was all right. Overjoyed he saw something he knew he did his signature blitzball move the sphere kick to the people on the beach. When Tidus swam ashore the players were amazed at what they saw. Tidus was finally happy and thought to himself that things were looking up. After he did his move again he talked to the captain who said his name was Wakka.</p> <p>Wakka said this team was the Besaid Aurochs and asked Tidus where he came from. Tidus said Zanarkand again and everyone was amazed he said that. Wakka wondered if he was serious. Tidus, to save himself said he was near Sin and his head was all foggy like even though it really wasn’t. Still hungry Wakka took Tidus back to the village to get something to eat. On the way though Tidus thinking he could trust this Wakka asked if Zanarkand was really destroyed. Wakka then explains to Tidus what happened. Tidus then thought Rikku and Wakka couldn’t both be lying. They then dive in the river to get to the village but on the way there Wakka headlocks Tidus and asks Tidus to help him in a huge upcoming Blitzball tournament. Tidus accepts and they go.</p> <br/> <h3>Adventures In Besaid</h3> <p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-52058\" href=\"/wakka/4005-52058/\" slug=\"wakka\">Wakka</a> tells Tidus to go visit the temple and the Crusaders lodge. Tidus does both and goes back to Wakka’s place. Wakka said the food isn’t ready yet but he offered him a bed. Tidus accepted and fell asleep. Waking up later in the afternoon he notices Wakka gone and goes to the temple. Tidus wonders what is wrong. Wakka says the summoner hasn’t come back yet. Tidus asks if it’s dangerous and Wakka nodded. Tidus runs in without knowing any of the rules. He solves the puzzles inside and when he’s about to take the elevator Wakka goes in behind him. Wakka then explains to Tidus everything about why not to barge in. They then go down into the Chamber of Faith to 2 people.</p> <p>Tidus and Wakka go down to Lulu and Kimahri. Lulu first approaches Wakka wondering why he was down there. Wakka tries to think of something but then Lulu turned to Tidus wondering who he was. Tidus responded by saying whether or not the summoner was okay. At that moment Yuna came out the Chamber of the Faith happy she had finally become a full fledged summoner. They left the chamber and went to the front of the temple. There Yuna showed off her first Aeon, which is named Valefor.</p> <p>Later that night Wakka introduced Tidus to the rest of the Besaid Aurochs. Tidus and Wakka had the boys cheering when they got their new goal of victory. Tidus then went over to Yuna to go speak with her. Tidus was however greeted by unkindly words. Yuna got up though from speaking with the elderly people and spoke to Tidus. This was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47375\" href=\"/yuna/4005-47375/\" slug=\"yuna\">Yuna</a> and Tidus’s first meeting. They speak for a brief moment until a child comes over to Yuna and Yuna says she will speak with Tidus more the next day. Tidus then goes over to Wakka and he goes to bed.</p> <p>During Tidus’s dream he encounters Yuna and they wonder where the boat is so they can go to Zanarkand. This encounter is interrupted by Rikku appearing in Tidus’s dream. Then another person enters his dream, his father Jecht. This dream for Tidus then started to turn into a nightmare. Tidus awakes when he blurts out something in his sleep. Tidus hears some people talking outside the Crusader’s Tent and he opens the entrance to the tent a little so he can see who it is.</p> <p>Outside the tent Wakka and Lulu are seen arguing with one another and it seems Lulu is winning. They talk about Tidus and why Wakka brought him there. They also talk about Wakka’s younger brother Chappu who died a few years earlier. When Lulu leaves Wakka walks in the tent and Tidus asks Wakka about who Chappu is. They both go to sleep so they can go with Yuna on her journey to Zanarkand. </p> <p>The next day Tidus wakes up and goes outside where he sees Wakka and Lulu standing together. Wakka gives Tidus a new sword called the Brotherhood.</p> <p>After a discussion about the sword Yuna comes out with a suitcase. Initially Lulu thought that all of those things inside the suitcase were Yuna’s. Yuna revealed they weren’t hers. They were gifts for the temples they were too visit. Yuna left behind the things and they were on their way to the boat. Along the way Tidus and Yuna got in some knowledge about fiends and they got some training in too.</p> <br/> <h3>Hit By Water</h3> <p>When they got to the boat everyone got on and Yuna said goodbye to everyone. The boat is supposed to take the gang to Kilika Island so Yuna can pray to the faith and so The Aurochs can pray for victory. During the boat ride though everyone is attacked by Sin on the boat and Yuna and her Guardians go on the offensive. They eventually draw back Sin but Tidus gets knocked off balance and falls overboard.</p> <p>Wakka jumped in the water to find Tidus unconcious being attacked by Sin Spawn. Wakka revives Tidus and they fight the Sin spawn eventually winning. They get back on the boat where they arrive at Kilika a while later. They find out Sin has attacked the island leaving many dead and Yuna goes to do a sending. The Aurochs go about fixing parts of the island while Tidus, Lulu, and Kimahri watch Yuna do the sending.</p> <br/> <h3>The Sending</h3> <p>Seeing how Tidus has just got to Spira he has never seen a sending and when he saw his first one he was kinda creeped out by it. He never wanted to see another one performed. The next day they go to the temple so Yuna can pray. Once there they see a summoner name Dona and her Guardian Bartello. They talk to them and leave for the Chamber of the Fayth. Tidus isn’t a guardian yet though so he couldn’t go. When he was about to leave Dona and Bartello came back and Bartello threw him back on the elevator leading down into the Chamber.</p> <p>The elevator goes down but it doesn’t go back up so Tidus is stuck with the decision of whether to go in and solve the puzzle or not. He decides to go in and he solves the puzzle only to be greeted by 2 less than happy people. Lulu gets angry and Wakka wonders why he’s down there. Yuna comes out eventually though and they leave the Chamber. </p><br/> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3>Final Fantasy X-2</h3> <p>It is now 2 years after the final Fantasy X events. This is when Rikku showed Yuna a sphere found on Mt. Gagazet. This sphere will show them many mystical things. It shows Yuna a young man who looks like Tidus in a prison of some sort. So Yuna joins the Gullwings to save him. The Gullwings are a sphere hunting team. So they will travel Spira in hopes of finding Tidus or to atleast see if he is alive. Later, Yuna finds out the person she saw was actually Shuyin. But, then it later shows Tidus being revived by the fayth. The fayth did this because Yuna had saved the world again from its destruction. The two then reunite with a loving hug and tears were sheded. So Tidus was able to live a nice and normal life for then on. </p><br/> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3>Kingdom Hearts</h3> <p>Later Tidus apears in Kingdom of Hearts. He is about 13 years old at that time. He is energetic and athletic. He loves to hang around with the younger versions of Sora and Riku. He often takes off on adventures around Destiny Island. Like always, he still has a love for Blitzball. </p><strong> <br/></strong> <h3>Final Fantasy Dissidia </h3> <p>Tidus is one of the heroes fighting for the side of Cosmos in this game. A light-hearted, cheerful youth, he follows his father's footsteps as an ace blitzball player for the Zanakard Abes. In battle, he is an agile fighter who easily dodges opponent's attacks as he performs his own. While he appears to be cheerful and lighthearted to his allies, Tidus' weak point is his emotions concerning his father Jecht. He seeks to fight and defeat Jecht to prove himself to him and settle his hatred for him<strong>.    </strong></p> <h3>Stats:</h3> <p>Tidus' battle style is Spry Striker, a style based on the abilities of his celestial weapon in <i>Final Fantasy X</i>, the Caladbolg. Many of Tidus' attacks cause him to jump or dodge before attacking, letting him swiftly dodge enemy attacks and counter with his own in the same movement, while some of his other attacks are Mid ranged. His attacks consist of fast-paced sword combos and blitzball throws, and his HP attacks are his sword skills and the infamousJecht Shot.  He also has very fast ground movement. However, Tidus is mostly a melee fighter, as most of his long-range attacks are even then short-range, and he has a slow recovery rate when attacking. Because most of his attacks cause him to dodge before striking, this has the inadvertent effect of giving a lag to them between when the player inputs a command and when Tidus actually attacks. </p> <h2>   Swords</h2> <p>Here are a list of swords Tidus uses in battle.</p> <p>Longsword</p> <p>Warrior's Sword</p> <p>Enchanted Sowrd</p> <p>Baroque Sword</p> <p>Hunter's Sword</p> <p>Knight Sword</p> <p>Wizard Sword </p> <p>Taming Sword</p> <p>Brotherhood</p> <p>Liquid Steel</p> <p>Ice Brand</p> <p>Excalibur</p> <p>Variable Steel</p> <p>Mirage Sword </p> <p>Prism Steel</p> <p>Avenger</p> <p>Vendetta</p> <p>Gilventure</p> <p>Astral Sword</p> <p>Hrunting </p> <p>Ambitious</p> <p>Ascalon</p> <p>Durandul</p> <p>Lionheart</p> <p>Heartbreaker</p> <p>Save the Queen</p> <p>Balmung</p> <p>Ragnarok</p> <p>Lightning Steel</p> <p>Flametongue</p> <p>Double Edge</p> <p>Tri-Steel</p> <p>Crystal Sword</p> <p>Slasher</p> <p>Fencing Saber</p> <p>Rune Sword</p> <p>Soldier's Saber</p> <p>Sorcery Sword</p> <p>Force Saber</p> <p>Vigilante</p> <p>Sonic Steel </p> <p>Lifesaver</p> <p>Warlock</p> <p>Master Sword</p> <p>Runemaster</p> <p>Twilight Steel</p> <p>Muted Steel</p> <p>Lullaby Steel</p> <p>Poison Steel</p> <p>Basilisk Steel</p> <p>Stunning Steel</p> <p>Deathbringer</p> <p>Razzmatazz</p> <p>Nightbringer</p> <p>Mage Masher</p> <p>Nightmare</p> <p>Side Winder</p> <p>Gravestone</p> <p>Largamente</p> <p>Danse Macabre</p> <p>Helter-Skelter</p> <p>Arc Sword</p> <p>Apocalyspe</p> <p>Caladbolg</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Footsteps</h2> <p>Pedro discovered he had inherited his father’s electric powers when he discovered his identity. His first act almost led him down a path of crime, much like his father. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48488\" href=\"/templar/4005-48488/\" slug=\"templar\">Templar</a> saw him and recruited him to the second generation of Sentinels until it disbanded; however, it was Pedro who tried convincing Templar to reform the team. Templar denied, but after Electron had to save <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48617\" href=\"/harlette/4005-48617/\" slug=\"harlette\">Harlette</a> from a demon attack he called in the rest of the team. Their reunion was cut short when another demon horde blew up the base and knocked Electron out. Thankfully, the team did survived and they got transported to a hell dimension where the team confronted the evil demon, Damien. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48616\" href=\"/gospel/4005-48616/\" slug=\"gospel\">Gospel</a> managed to overcome Damien’s influence and teleported the team into different areas of the hell dimension. Pedro was in a room with treasures, which he decided to steal in hopes of helping his family. Eventually, the team regrouped, but Pedro got knocked-out when his powers went haywire. When he did reawaken he was able to single-handily revitalize the team and take down an army of demons. The team succeeded at the cost of Gospel’s life, but with her last bit of energy she teleported the team home.</p> <p>Back at home, Pedro tried to restart a relationship with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48621\" href=\"/splash/4005-48621/\" slug=\"splash\">Splash</a>, but their powers got in the way like so many times before; Splash was angry and asked Pedro to leave. In his house, Pedro gave his mother some money, which she believed was from the Sentinels. The Sentinels got back together and went to the scene of their former base. Electron was sent ahead to scout, but got ambushed by the government superteam, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48516\" href=\"/squadron-7/4060-48516/\" slug=\"squadron-7\">Squadron 7</a>. Pedro woke up, but the team was still failing until Splash came in and, with the help of Pedro, overpowered the team with their power combo. The two started to talk, but it got cut off when they were abducted.</p><p>When they were back on solid ground the males of the group found themselves in an alien prison with power inhibitors, but with the help of another alien they were able to escape and meet up with the girls. They were shocked when they found Harlette in the middle of several dead guards. Pedro was a bit disturbed to find that Splash was not with the rest, but towards the end he found her and she managed to save the team a second time. The team stole an alien ship and Pedro and Splash rekindled their relationship since Pedro still had his inhibitor on.</p>",

However, by some unknown phenomenon, Skaar survived. Rising from the ashes of the charred planet, he was christened with the name of Skaar, and the title Son of Sakaar.</p><p>The Son of Hulk, having survived the monsters of the radioactive swamps, defeated the barbarian general <a href=\"/axeman-bone/4005-55726/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55726\">Axeman</a> of the Fillians. Not long after, Skaar locked horns with the warrior <a href=\"/omaka/4005-57704/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57704\">Princess Omaka</a>. The Princess and Skaar joined forces to defend Sakaar’s refugees from the invading barbarians. Hailed as a savior, Skaar walked the Prophet's Walk through the Great Desert of Sakaar. Once in the shadow of the holy stone, he claimed his Old Power, his birthright as promised by <a href=\"/old-sam/4005-59033/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59033\">Old Sam</a> of the Clear-Eye Shadow. Skaar's ascension was spoiled however, when the hidden technology Old Sam sought to use to awaken the Old Power within Skaar was cannibalized by the Wildebots.</p><p>Despite this set back there was still a chance that the power would awaken on its own. Before this mystery could unravel, however, the holy rock was destroyed by Hiro Amin, the Axeman's Blind Shadow Priest. His attack was blistering with amazing new strength promising nothing but destruction for Skaar and the refugees. Unknown to all present, Old Sam had once tried to train Hiro-Amin to control the Old Power, but he lacked the discipline and skill to master the secret power of the Shadow People. Skaar was able to defeat Hiro-Amin by separating him from the planet - thereby decreasing his power.</p><p>After seeing the might of the Old Power, Skaar went out to master it. He soon found himself allied with the <a href=\"/red-king/4005-14846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14846\">Former King</a>, who was saved from death and rebuilt with a majority of cybernetic parts by the Wildebots.

Gorgon mounts an attack, causing <a href=\"/starbolt/4005-6092/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6092\">Starbolt</a> to go through the portal. Gorgon gives chase, but becomes stranded on the planet as well. With nowhere to go, the two warriors take their fight to the ground. In the midst of battle Starbolt sees the Wildebots attacking both his and Gorgon's crews. Turning his attention from Starbolt, Gorgon easily defeats the Wildebots, only to realize that they weren't after him, they were after his ship. As Starbolt searches for any of his surviving crew members Gorgon attacks yet again. The earthquakes caused by Gorgon's attacks cause Skaar ans Old Sam to take notice of the battle. Arriving on the scene, Skaar throws a massive boulder at the two, ending the fight. Later, while searching for warmth and food, he sees Starbolt being attacked by a Molten beast. Knowing Starbolt was using the heat to recover, he asks Starbolt to surrender. Starbolt agrees, and Gorgon defeats the Molten beast to continue their alliance. After daybreak, Gorgon sees the site of the massive explosion that killed Caiera and so many others, and asks an Old Woman what happened. The woman tells them of the Old Power and the Son of Hulk. Suddenly Skaar arrives and attacks the unwary group. Just when all seemed lost <a href=\"/lockjaw/4005-3534/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3534\">Lockjaw</a> teleports them to the Royal Palace.

Starbolt tells Lockjaw to teleport them to the Shi'ar <a href=\"/\">Throne World</a>, or they shall all watch the girl burn. Lockjaw teleports both Luna and Gorgon, who, after rescuing Luna, flees. Starbolt and Gorgon tell their respective Kings about the Old Power, and how it could tear whole planets asunder.With this knowledge both <a href=\"/\">Black bolt</a> and <a href=\"/\">Vulcan</a> have the same goal, to reach the Old Power first.</p><h3>Galactus Comes</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/651412-sonhulk007_cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-651412\" data-ratio=\"1.5183466891607\" data-width=\"2371\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2371px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/651412-sonhulk007_cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-651412\"><img alt=\"Skaar vs. Silver Savage\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/651412-sonhulk007_cov.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/651412-sonhulk007_cov.jpg 2371w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/77/651412-sonhulk007_cov.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/651412-sonhulk007_cov.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\"></a><figcaption>Skaar vs. Silver Savage</figcaption></figure><p>The Silver Surfer arrives on Sakaar to warn of the coming of Galactus.

The strain of this task however robbed him of his powers yet again allowing Skaar to fit him with an Obedience disk. The Silver Savage returns.</p><p>Skaar, with his new ally the Red King, head to battle the barbarian army of Axeman Bone. Upon their arrival, Skaar loses himself to his his blood-lust, losing any concern for innocent lives. He even tells the Axeman that he will murder his young daughter, <a href=\"/lihla/4005-66655/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66655\">Lihla</a>. Axeman in fear of losing his daughter, awakens the Dragons of Fillia to kill Skaar and anyone else in his vicinity. The Surfer desperately tries to get Skaar to help the innocent, but all Skaar is intent on nothing but the death of Axeman..</p><p>Caiera's spirit gathers it's strength to make one final plea of her son, she asked him to give up his rage. Heedless of her request Skaar charges into battle. Caiera, using the what little strength was left her as a spirit, used her Oldstrong power to return in a stone form of herself then in the image of Hulk. She defeats Skaar with ease and asks why he insisted on being a killer instead of a attempting to make peace.Skaar then reveals his plan of killing everyone on the planet he deemed evil after glimpsing the destruction so many people caused when he briefly wielded the power of Oldstrong.</p><p>Offering him one last chance at redemption, Caiera makes <a href=\"/\">Silver Surfer</a> bring Skaar to <a href=\"/\">Galactus</a>, a being who has killed billions, in order to truly grasp what it would mean if his plan succeeded. Skaar is shown that the consequences of his actions will result with the death of everyone on the planet by the hands of Galactus. Skaar sees his planet destroyed, which he believes is real, but it is merely a vision shown to him by the Surfer. The Surfer then sends him back to Sakaar believing he has changed his mind. Caiera then returns to being one with the planet, believing Skaar has taken up the Silver Surfer on his offer of evacuating the planet and returns the Old Power to help him do so.</p><p>Skaar then unsuspectingly uses his newly returned old power to destroy the ships, dooming everyone on the planet. He chose the planet and his mother's soul over its inhabitants and gave the Surfer an ultimatum, spare Sakaar or he will use his old power to increase Galactus' hunger which would cause him to consume every planet the Surfer managed to save. The Surfer decides to leave, informing everyone on the planet of his actions and how they would subsequently be responsible for the deaths of billions. Caiera returns to him once more and denounces him as her son for his decision and exiles him from the planet to Earth, saying she now understands the reason the people of Earth wanted to get rid of Hulk. Caiera absorbs the power of Sakaar and quietly waits.</p><h3>Planet Skaar</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/826713-picture_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-826713\" data-ratio=\"0.63007683863886\" data-width=\"911\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 911px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/826713-picture_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-826713\"><img alt=\"Earth, Meet Skaar\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/826713-picture_2.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/826713-picture_2.png 911w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/826713-picture_2.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Earth, Meet Skaar\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/826713-picture_2.png\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/826713-picture_2.png 911w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/826713-picture_2.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Earth, Meet Skaar</figcaption></figure><p>Skaar's Old Power allowed him to survive the trip through space to Earth, and when he made landfall, all those with a connection to his blood and his Old Power could sense it.

There was no sign of Skaar in the immediate aftermath, and it was believed he had been killed by the blast.</p><p>In fact, the blast only weakened Skaar to the point that he transformed. He became a small boy, who appeared to be around the age of twelve. Along with this new form came a new personality, one who despised the things Skaar did so much that he wanted to kill himself. The only thing that prevented him from leaping off a cliff was another boy getting hurt and needing his help. This led to a misunderstanding with police that provoked him to transform into Skaar once more.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/818180-son_of_nobody003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-818180\" data-ratio=\"0.75225225225225\" data-width=\"444\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 444px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/818180-son_of_nobody003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-818180\"><img alt=\"Skaar's Inner Child\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-width=\"444\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/818180-son_of_nobody003.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/818180-son_of_nobody003.jpg 444w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Skaar's Inner Child\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/818180-son_of_nobody003.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/818180-son_of_nobody003.jpg 444w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-width=\"444\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Skaar's Inner Child</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"/warbound/4060-43240/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43240\">Warbound</a> found and reached out to Skaar, but he turned on them.

The two fought despite the Warbound's initial attempt to stop them. Skaar was outmatched by his father's strength, and soon it became apparent that the Hulk had no idea who any of them were. This was not the Hulk who had become king of Sakaar. This was an angry, low intellect Hulk who just wanted to smash. Skaar tried to push Hulk into remembering and becoming the Green Scar once again. He would have succeeded had, Banner not pushed those thoughts away, causing the Hulk lost interest in fighting Skaar. Their battle had caused significant damage to a nearby nuclear power plant, risking disaster should it explode . Hulk and the Warbound tried to contain it, but it was Skaar who used his Old Power to successfully do so. He then stabbed the Hulk with his sword and left saying he would return to finish the job when the Hulk was worth killing.</p><h3>Father and Son</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/885700-46_incredible_hulk_603.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-885700\" data-ratio=\"1.4333333333333\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/885700-46_incredible_hulk_603.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-885700\"><img alt=\"Bring Your Son to Work Day\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" data-width=\"669\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/885700-46_incredible_hulk_603.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/885700-46_incredible_hulk_603.jpg 900w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/885700-46_incredible_hulk_603.jpg 669w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bring Your Son to Work Day\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/885700-46_incredible_hulk_603.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/885700-46_incredible_hulk_603.jpg 900w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/885700-46_incredible_hulk_603.jpg 669w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" data-width=\"669\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bring Your Son to Work Day</figcaption></figure><p>When Banner became unable to transform into the Hulk, he lured Skaar into a confrontation. Skaar was disappointed to find puny Banner and not the Hulk. He did not care about Banner. However, Banner made him a deal. Eventually, he would become the Hulk again, and when that happened, the Green Scar would most likely kill Skaar. So the deal was that Banner would train Skaar to kill the Hulk when the time came. Skaar seemed doubtful that he needed the help but accepted Banner's company.</p><p>Banner's first lesson for Skaar came in the form of fighting the <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut</a>. Since Skaar has never fought someone like juggernaut, he could not stop the unstoppable, but he was able to hurl him into orbit. Later, Banner explained to him the <a href=\"/conan/4005-2438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2438\">Conan</a> joke that people kept making when they met him. Skaar's next lesson would see him pitted against the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>. <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> was sent after Skaar and Banner because what happened with Juggernaut. This coincided with Banner tipping off Daken to Skaar's whereabouts to stage a meeting like he did with Juggernaut. Banner kept Wolverine occupied while Skaar met with <a href=\"/daken/4005-42501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken</a>. The two seemed to bond over their similarities, but things then took an unexpected turn. Skaar transformed again, and the child he became asked Daken to kill him. Daken was about to comply when Banner interfered by throwing Wolverine into Daken. The anger over being thwarted again caused the child to transform back into Skaar and fight. An element within Daken's claws, the <a href=\"/muramasa-blades/4055-54935/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-54935\">Muramasa Blade</a>, neutralized Skaar's healing factor, and Skaar was nearly at Daken's mercy when Banner forced an end to the fight by threatening to kill Wolverine if Daken did not back down. The two father and son pairs parted ways.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1004021-skaar2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1004021\" data-ratio=\"0.52166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1004021-skaar2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1004021\"><img alt=\"Plans of His Own\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1004021-skaar2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1004021-skaar2.jpg 600w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1004021-skaar2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Plans of His Own\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1004021-skaar2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1004021-skaar2.jpg 600w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/1004021-skaar2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Plans of His Own</figcaption></figure><p>Banner and Skaar took a detour from their lessons to save Kate Waynesboro from Norman Osborn's attempts to harness the <a href=\"/old-power/4015-55874/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55874\">Old Power</a>. This put Banner on Osborn's list. <a href=\"/victoria-hand/4005-59261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59261\">Victoria Hand</a> and <a href=\"/moonstone/4005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\">Karla Sofen</a> ambushed them as they were about to hit another Old Power facility. As Skaar fought \"Ms. Marvel\", she manipulated him and let him in on what their plan truly was. Gamma particles were being released from the nearby Old Power facility, which were meant to accelerate Banner's eventual transformation back into the Hulk. Skaar let it happen, making sure the standoff lasted long enough for the particles to coat Banner, he then grabbed Banner and leaped into the distance. When they landed, he informed his father of what was really happening.</p><h3>Fall of the Hulks</h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/fall-of-the-hulks/4045-55979/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55979\">Fall of the Hulks</a></p><p>Banner and Skaar helped to fight off an invasion of Sakaarian beasts lead by <a href=\"/tyrannus/4005-3468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3468\">Tyrannus</a>. After parade-like procession, <a href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\">Uatu</a> the Watcher appears and is studying Bruce. Banner believes he has seen Betty Ross (who has recently been shown to be 'alive') in the crowd and soon leaves Skaar with the Fantastic Four as he teleports to the Red Hulk's location in New Mexico. After a brief skirmish and conversation, Banner transports to <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>, in time to find the Cosmic Hulk attacking <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom</a>. Skaar shows up,having found a Teleportation device purposely left behind by Banner, believing that the automaton is his father, and tries to prevent Doom from killing it. Doom quickly turns the tables on Skaar, and as Skaar reverts to his puny form he is rescued by Banner. Doom had been poisoned by the Cosmic Hulk's controllers (the <a href=\"/intelligencia/4060-56959/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56959\">Intelligencia</a>) with a neural anesthetizer and the Cosmic Hulk makes off with the poisoned Doom. Banner attempts to make amends with the puny Skaar, but he quickly regains his previous size and anger toward Banner.</p><p>The two then head off to help the Avengers, who have been caught up in a struggle with the <a href=\"/red-she-hulk/4005-65529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65529\">Red She-Hulk</a> as she was attempting to abduct <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a> for the Intelligencia.

The Cathexis machine is basically the same machine that gave Leonard Samson and the Red Hulk their powers. The Leader reveals that all the Hulked-out-Heroes will soon die, because of an overload of radiation in their bodies. Bruce Banner and the other ‘smartest’ reconfigure the Cathexis machine to drain the radiation from the Hulked-out-Heroes, and so the machine that's draining the radiation doesn't malfunction or explode, Banner willingly absorbs the excess gamma radiation into his body. The machine starts absorbing energy very quickly and Banner’s body cannot keep up with the absorption, so Samson (attempting to show that he was always a hero), walks to the machine and begins to help Banner absorb the energy as well. This turns out to be a poor decision on Samson's part as his body can't contain the amount of energies that Banners can. All of this excess energy burns Samson to a crisp and his charred body falls to the floor of the Heli-carrier. The remaining heroes aboard the Heli-carrier warn Banner to stop, as the energies he is absorbing will rob him of his freedom from the Hulk, but Banner knows the repercussions and tells the others to get off the ship. Reed becomes worried about what the Hulk will do once he returns, only to have <a href=\"/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\">Amadeus Cho</a> remind him, that this is what Banner has trained Skaar to do all along. The Heroes abscond from the Heli-carrier and as the machine explodes, and the Heli-carrier crashes into the ground. From the rubble and smoke steps a renewed Hulk, once again shaking and cracking the Eastern Seaboard with each step. This is the moment Skaar has been waiting for.</p><p>Skaar and Hulk quickly begin their brawl, with Skaar trying to anger Hulk by mentioning Caiera. This incarnation of Hulk seems unaffected by this and brushes Skaar off as a mere annoyance... until Skaar reveals that Caiera lived on through the planet, until <i>he</i> fed it to Galactus. This enrages Hulk and the two begin to fight once again. Neither seems to really have the upper-hand, but at one moment when the Hulk is down, Red She-Hulk steps in, hits Skaar and tells Hulk to run away. Naturally, Hulk refuses and Skaar lands a massive blow against Red She-Hulk, sending her crashing into a parking structure containing bystanders. As Skaar wails on Hulk, memories of Bruce's childhood flash in his mind. Still being beaten on by Skaar, Hulk releases a sonic-clap, sending mounds of sand from the beach they are fighting on into and around the crumbling parking structure, saving the innocents inside.</p><p>Skaar now sees that the monster Bruce had been training him to kill wasn't a monster at all. As he hits this realization, Hulk's emotions get the best of him and he lays Skaar to waste with a series of savage blows. Skaar reverts to his child form and tells Hulk that he's done; Hulk is not the monster he thought. Hulk too returns to his human form and is struck with the emotion of all that has just happened. Red tells him to go to Skaar, who is now quietly sobbing, and Bruce at first doubts that he can. As he reaches out in apology Skaar turns and firmly embraces him around the waist.</p><h3>Dark Son</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1373272\" data-ratio=\"0.77300085984523\" data-width=\"1163\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1163px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1373272\"><img alt=\"Dark Son\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg 1163w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dark Son\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg 1163w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg 960w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1373272-hulkv2612_613_cov.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dark Son</figcaption></figure><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/dark-son/4045-56241/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56241\">Dark Son</a></p><p>After coming to a violent reconciliation with his father, Skaar allowed himself to remain in his smaller child-like form and settled down with a newly established Hulk Family consisting of himself, Hulk, She-Hulk, <a href=\"/savage-she-hulk/4005-27405/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27405\">Lyra</a>, A-Bomb, Korg and Betty Ross. The relative peace did not last long though.

They needed to prevent K'ai from colliding with Earth, and he had no faith that Hiro-Kala could ever be reasoned with. When the time came to unleash a devastating eruption to divert K'ai's course, Skaar found that he could not do it and kill all the innocent people Hiro-Kala had strategically placed in harm's way. He held the eruption back and kept the planet together with an incredible exertion of his Old Power, seemingly destroying himself in the process.</p><p>Skaar reformed himself from K'ai's terrain and finally confronted Hiro directly, taking over for his father. Despite his earlier beliefs, he tried to reason with his brother, telling Hiro that he was a monster too but Banner was able to help him. Hiro was too far down his path of madness, though. Skaar used his superior mastery of the Old Power to seal his brother in stone, and the Worldmind of K'ai took Hiro's life to make up for the damage done to the planet.</p><h3>Chaos War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1615914\" data-ratio=\"1.1820987654321\" data-width=\"648\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 648px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1615914\"><img alt=\"In the Chaos War\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\" data-width=\"541\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png 648w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png 541w\"><noscript><img alt=\"In the Chaos War\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png 648w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1615914-hulks.png 541w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\" data-width=\"541\"></noscript></a><figcaption>In the Chaos War</figcaption></figure><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/chaos-war/4045-56257/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56257\">Chaos War</a></p><p>No rest came for the Hulks, Skaar included, as <a href=\"/mikaboshi/4005-44368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44368\">Amatsu-Mikaboshi</a> began destroying reality as soon as the situation with Hiro-Kala was resolved.

Among these enemies, Skaar fought perhaps one of the worst, the Hulk's own abusive father <a href=\"/brian-banner/4005-10874/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10874\">Brian Banner</a>.</p><p>After keeping Marlo out of the reach of the Chaos King's minions, Skaar and the other Hulks were called into action by Hercules to fight on the front lines. Mikaboshi was diverted into a pocket dimension, and Hercules rebuilt what had been destroyed.</p><h3>Savage Land</h3><p>Skaar, his father (Hulk), and the Warbound head to the Savage Land to aid Ka-Zar in helping the Sakaarian refugees that live there. Miek captures the Hulk and implants eggs of his species in his body. While Hulk is under Miek's control, Miek explains that he just wants his species to survive, and Skaar and the Warbound sympathize with him. Hulk defeats Miek, seemingly killing him, but Skaar saves Miek's babies. Hulk leaves, and Skaar stays in the Savage Land to take care and look after the remaining people of Sakaar.</p><h3>Dark Avengers</h3><p>Sought out by Norman Osborn, Skaar was asked to join his new Dark Avengers. After battling the New Avengers, it was soon revealed that Skaar was in fact a double agent planted by Captain America himself. Once defeating the Dark Avengers, Skaar then freed Captain America from his imprisonment. Once the Dark Avengers were defeated by the New Avengers, Skaar was then asked to join Luke Cage's as an enforcer for the Dark Avengers who were assigned to replace the time-lost Thunderbolts.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p><b>Superhuman Strength:</b> Like the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, Skaar's strength is based on his emotions. As the son of the man who claims to be 'the strongest there is', Skaar presumably possesses the capacity for vast levels of physical strength. Considering he wields the <a href=\"/old-power/4015-55874/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55874\">Old Power</a> and Gamma blood (like the Hulk), Skaar has practically limitless strength. His strength can be further augmented if he taps into the <a href=\"/old-power/4015-55874/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55874\">Old Power</a>. On one occasion, he absorbed 100 trillion tons of kinetic energy from a city to fight the Hulk and on a different occasion, he sent <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut</a> flying into space with ease. Skaar has been seen punching beings miles away, slaying the dragons of Sakaar, overturning tanks, and fighting Ben Grimm with ease. With the Old Power he is able to amplify his strength. Skaar's great strength extends into his legs as well, allowing him to leap great distances.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46286/875811-conquerer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875811\" data-ratio=\"1.0852842809365\" data-width=\"598\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 598px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46286/875811-conquerer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875811\"><img alt=\"Son of Hulk\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px\" data-width=\"884\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46286/875811-conquerer.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46286/875811-conquerer.jpg 598w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Son of Hulk\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46286/875811-conquerer.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46286/875811-conquerer.jpg 598w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px\" data-width=\"884\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Son of Hulk</figcaption></figure><p><b>Self-Sustenance</b>: Skaar is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space unaided and does not need air, food, water, or sleep.</p><p><b>Suspended Aging</b>: For all intents and purposes Skaar does not age, this is because of his great healing factor that regenerates his cells and the gamma energy and Old Power that empowers him.</p><p><b><b>Superhuman Stamina</b>: </b>During his time searching for Axeman Bone he has shown the ability to keep stamina up for great time.</p><p><b><b>Superhuman Durability:</b> </b>Skaar has survived after having the full impact of the Power Cosmic aimed at him. He has also survived falling from outer space, becoming a comet and diving to a huge chunk of rock and seconds later, manages to stand up back to his feet and continues to battle. In addition to his Hulk-like strength, Skaar's body possesses a high degree of resistance to injury and pain, as well as a unique immunity to anything heat related. Skaar's skin is capable of withstanding extreme heat without blistering and great impact.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Endurance: </strong>Skaar was born in lava, mauled by monsters, and tortured by crazy priests as a child. His endurance is quite high, and being the son of the Hulk further increases his endurance.</p><p><b>Superhuman Healing Factor:</b> He can heal damaged or destroyed body parts in just seconds, his healing abilities rival <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>'s or the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>'s healing factor. His healing factor has been shown after being stabbed in the face by a huge pole arm and when half of his body was stabbed by Axeman.</p><p><b>Hand-to-Hand Combat:</b> Skaar is experienced in brawling beasts and soldiers. Even during his childhood, he battled many Barbarian Invaders that threatened to kill the innocent and has defeated an Imperial Prime like the <a href=\"/axeman-bone/4005-55726/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55726\">Axeman</a> himself.</p><p><b>Weapons Master:</b> Skaar has been shown wielding large Axes, Swords and Staffs. He is also a master at controlling the Old Power that he uses to his advantage and as his defense.</p><p><b>Transformation</b>: Skaar can transform into the human form of a twelve year old boy. Human Skaar said that Skaar kept his alter ego suppressed until Osborn's bomb. When human Skaar gets angry it triggers his transformation into his original form.</p><p><b>Old Power:</b> From his mother, Skaar inherited the ability to wield the <a href=\"/old-power/4015-55874/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55874\">Old Power</a>, letting him channel the tectonic energies of a planet, granting him mastery over earth and stone. With the Old Power, he can break or mend the earth as he sees fit, turn his body to stone, and call up magma from the depths. He can also increase all his powers and abilities, by using the Old Power.</p><p><strong>Self-Resurrection: </strong>Like his mother, Skaar can use planet's power to revive himself if his entire body is fully destroyed. as this ability is based on planet's existence. It can not be used since that planet is destroyed. The old power can resurrect Skaar from rocks.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>Skaar was shown to be almost killed by the Murasama blade due to its nature of negating superhuman healing factors.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><h3>Skaar:</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 7'6\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 900 Ibs</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Green</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Black</li><li><b>Strength:</b> Over 100 tons</li></ul><h3>Human Form:</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 4'5''</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 50 Ibs</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Green</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Black</li></ul><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-703810\" data-ratio=\"0.786\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-703810\"><img alt=\"First appearance of Skaar\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png 500w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"First appearance of Skaar\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png 500w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png 480w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35127/703810-skaar2.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>First appearance of Skaar</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href=\"/what-if-planet-hulk/4050-19301/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19301\">What If? Planet Hulk</a>, Skaar debuts hidden in the shadows as a young adult. This reality saw the Hulk die on Sakaar while Caeira the Oldstrong lived. She came to Earth on a quest of vengeance, killing or enslaving Earth's mightiest heroes. Skaar was born on an Earth ruled by his mother. The enslaved heroes were forced to construct an enormous statue honoring the Hulk, which became complete 21 years after Caeira first arrived. Skaar escorted his mother to the complete statue, and she turned herself to stone in the statue's giant palm to be with her husband forever.</p><p>Skaar presumably inherited the Earth.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><p>Skaar is rumored to have an Animated appearance in the new Marvel show : Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. In this version he is shown as a brainwashed soldier of Annihilus before being freed. He has amnesia, remembering nothing of his past, having been kidnapped by the Leader and given to Annihilus before being used as a double agent until he turned on the leader and fully joined the agents. No mention has been made that he is Hulks son. He has shown hulk strength and proficiency with bladed weapons, but has not used the old power or any special ability. He is also the only one who speaks like a typical Hulk in short sentences and in the third person, though that may be more to correspond with his \"barbarian\" look.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><h4>Lego Marvel's The Avengers</h4><p>Skaar appears as playable character in the game.</p><p> </p>",

    "deck": "Gemini Saga once claimed that Aphrodite was the most beautiful among all the Saints. Kurumada named him after the greek Goddess of love and beauty as a reference to the Greek myth associated to the Pisces constellation.",
    "description": "<p><strong>Pisces Aphrodite is the last of the Gold Saints introduced by Kurumada in his manga. Aphrodite was a Saint famous not only because of his incredible, mesmerizing beauty, but also for his reputation as one of the strongest among the 88 Saints.</strong></p> <p><strong>Aphrodite never claimed to be the most beautiful creature, unlike the Silver Saint, Lizard Misty.    </strong></p>Aphrodite uses three different types of rose techniques.  The first, the red \"Royal Demon Rose\", can affect the victim either by the aroma or from a cut from one of the thorns.  Once this happens, the victim gradually loses all their senses, passes out, and eventually dies.  Aphrodite throws the black \"Piranhian Rose\" to slice at his opponent and cause massive damage.  His most powerful technique uses the white \"Bloody Rose\".  Aphrodite throws the Bloody Rose into the heart of his opponent, and it drains their blood.  When the rose has turned completely red, the person dies.<br/><br/> Pisces Aphrodite guards the twelfth and final temple of Sanctuary.  When Pegasus Seiya and Andromeda Shun arrived at his temple, Shun attempted to bind Aphrodite with his chains so that Seiya could escape.  Far from allowing Seiya to move on to Saga's palace, however, Aphrodite covered the trail with poisonous roses intended to deprive Seiya of his senses and slowly kill him.  The roses would have killed Seiya had Eagle Marin not arrived to save him.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, Shun challenged Aphrodite to battle.  Aphrodite seemed to take an interest in Shun, and tried to persuade him not to fight, but eventually decided to take the fight seriously.  He used several different types of roses with specific properties, but could not penetrate the Nebula Chain's defenses.  Shun trapped Aphrodite within the vortex of the Nebula Chain, increasing his Cosmo and telling Pisces to surrender or die.  Aphrodite refused, and used his last resort, the white rose, which drains the blood from its victims.  Within minutes, the white rose had killed Shun, but not before the Nebula Chain had killed Pisces Aphrodite.    ",

    "description": "<h2> Bio  </h2><p> Alkyone was the Captain of Queen <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4929\" href=\"/hippolyta/4005-4929/\"> Hippolyta</a>'s royal guard. She, along with three other Amazons, agreed to protect their Queen's life at all costs. When word got out that Queen Hippolyta was praying to the gods for a child, Alkyone believed it would destroy them.  <br /> <br />She has always hated <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\">Diana</a>, thinking she was the cause of all the Amazon's problems and has endlessly plotted to murder her. Her hatred for Diana is only matched by her praise for Hyppolyta and her illusions made her believe every horror she did was in Hyppolyta's name. The first time she has tried to murder Diana (who was barely born), Alkyone intruded in the Queen's rooms to slaughter the child but Hyppolyta woke up and punished her and her 3 friends by sending them to jail. Alkyone then asked her 3 friends to help her a few years later. She failed that time as well to murder the princess &amp; was \"humiliated\" by Diana.  <br /> <br />She was married to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32611\" href=\"/the-olympian/4005-32611/\">Achilles</a> and ruled <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56187\" href=\"/paradise-island/4020-56187/\">Paradise Island</a> for a short time but her intentions were always that Hyppolyta regained her throne. The third time Alkyone wanted, she called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-68202\" href=\"/cottus/4005-68202/\">Cottus</a>, a slimy black monster from the depts of Themyscira, believing it was the princesse's father.   <br /><br /></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/1199664-002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1199664\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.46484375\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:46.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/1199664-002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1199664\"><img alt=\" Hippolyta's revenge\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9241/1199664-002.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9241/1199664-002.jpg 1280w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9241/1199664-002.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9241/1199664-002.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption> Hippolyta's revenge</figcaption></figure>     She then \"killed\" Achilles, but he didn't die since his heart is that of a God. Alkyone was shot down by Hippolyta and later crushed with her 3 friends by Wonder Woman when she threw the black monster on the ledge where she was standing but we may never be sure wether if she drowned or managed to survive.",

The two hold humans in disdain, referring to them as apes.</p><p> </p><p>When Superman is able to return to Earth, he confronts the two in the <a href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41185\">Fortress of Solitude</a>, which they have occupied in his absence.

While hovering in front of the building, their powers give out and they fall to the ground. Superman catches the two, and informs them about their weakening condition. Back at the Fortress of Solitude, Superman offers to do the one thing he can do: put them into stasis in the Phantom Zone, where their condition will not progress. Bar-El tells Superman that he is proud of him, as he has shown him kindness even in the face of anger. He requests Superman place his hand in Lilo's and the two are phased into the Phantom Zone.</p><p> </p><p>Bar-El is later glimpsed through a Phantom Zone projector serving as the Warden of the Phantom Zone.</p><p> </p><h2>Appearances in Other Media</h2><p>Bar-El and Lilo both appear in the adaptation of <em><a href=\"/all-star-superman/4025-1158/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1158\">All-Star Superman</a></em>, which faithfully adapts their appearance therein.

The two set themselves up as the \"replacement Supermen\", and attempt to turn Earth into <a href=\"../../new-krypton/34-56084/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> New Krypton</a>. The two hold humans in disdain, referring to them as apes.</p><p> </p><p>When Superman is able to return to Earth, he confronts the two in the <a href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/4020-41185/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41185\">Fortress of Solitude</a>, which they have occupied in his absence. Bar-El assaults Superman, calling him out on his failure to enlarge the <a href=\"../../kandor/34-41290/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bottled City of Kandor </a>and keeping other survivors of Krypton in the <a href=\"../../phantom-zone/34-42370/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Phantom Zone</a>, despite them being insane criminals. Bar-El and Lilo beat Superman into space, and Bar-El punches him into the <a href=\"/the-moon/4020-42072/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42072\">moon</a>, causing the moon to crack.</p><p> </p><p>Bar-El and Lilo later travel to <a href=\"../../metropolis/34-41184/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Metropolis </a>to confront Superman at the <a href=\"/daily-planet/4020-55695/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55695\">Daily Planet</a>, in his guise as Clark Kent. While hovering in front of the building, their powers give out and they fall to the ground. Superman catches the two, and informs them about their weakening condition. Back at the Fortress of Solitude, Superman offers to do the one thing he can do: put them into stasis in the Phantom Zone, where their condition will not progress. Bar-El tells Superman that he is proud of him, as he has shown him kindness even in the face of anger. He requests Superman place his hand in Lilo's and the two are phased into the Phantom Zone.</p><h2>Powers:</h2><p> </p><figure style=\"width: 1199px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1471759-lilo_power.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471759\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.79816513761468\" data-width=\"1199\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1471759-lilo_power.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471759\"><img alt=\"Lilo: physical force \" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1471759-lilo_power.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1471759-lilo_power.jpg 1199w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/37889/1471759-lilo_power.jpg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/37889/1471759-lilo_power.jpg 480w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1471759-lilo_power.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Lilo: physical force </figcaption></figure><p>Lilo has the same powers as Superman (like all Kryptonians under a yellow sun).

She has a degree in Spanish Literature and was an ROTC member, her original ambitions to pursue law enforcement through the FBI or DEA. She is a former member of the Peace Corps, as well. However, after college, she competed in fitness competitions, which eventually led to an opportunity with the WWF.</p><h2>Wrestling Career</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37908/1091073-chyna2001ot6_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1091073\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.92230576441103\" data-width=\"399\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 399px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37908/1091073-chyna2001ot6_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1091073\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37908/1091073-chyna2001ot6_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37908/1091073-chyna2001ot6_1_.jpg 399w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-width=\"399\"></a></figure><p>Chyna has been dubbed the Ninth Wonder of the World because she has changed the face of television forever and is a pioneer for women in sports entertainment. Chyna's success has been measured through her hard work and ability to captivate audiences in every field of entertainment, wherever she may go. In addition, Chyna has also been called the First Lady of Sports Entertainment. She has broken more barriers than any other individual in professional wrestling history. Her career successes has empowered many other women to pursue success in professional wrestling.</p><p>As Chyna, Laurer debuted as the stoic bodyguard for D-Generation X. She was the first woman in history to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship, as well as the first woman to enter and win the Royal Rumble, becoming the number one contender for the WWF Championship belt. After enjoying considerable success, she received breast augmentation and had some reconstructive surgery to gain a more feminine appearance.</p><p>After leaving the WWF, Chyna briefly performed for the independent circuit for promotions like Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), and in more recent years, had a short-lived run with Total Nonstop Action (TNA) before retiring to perform other career paths (see below).</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>While working for WWF, Chyna appeared in two pictorals in <em>Playboy</em> magazine. A long-term relationship with fellow wrestler <a href=\"/triple-h/4005-68598/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68598\">Paul Levesque, </a>better known as Triple H, ended after he had an affair with co-worker <a href=\"/stephanie-mcmahon/4005-97612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-97612\">Stephanie McMahon</a>, which subsequently led to her leaving the WWF. Laurer was romantically involved with former fellow D-Generation X member Sean \"X-Pac\" Waltman. The two featured in a controversial sex tape, and dysfunction in the relationship came to public light. The pair has since split. Chyna was in rehab for a short period, and has since completely retired from professional wrestling. To make ends meet, she became a porn star for Vivid Video. She appeared as the <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a> in an X-rated Avengers parody, and later starred in her own spin-off film.</p><p>Joan Laurer  was found dead on April 20, 2016 in her home in California. It was later stated that she was dead for several days before she was found.</p><h2>In Comics</h2><p>Chyna has starred in two one-shots published by <a href=\"/chaos-comics/4010-1864/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1864\">Chaos! Comics. </a>In her first one-shot, written by <a href=\"/steven-grant/4040-41567/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41567\">Steven Grant</a> with art by documented wrestling fan <a href=\"/jill-thompson/4040-15787/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-15787\">Jill Thompson</a>, Chyna is a bodyguard hired to protect a young woman from a death cult. \"The Ninth Wonder of the World\" ends up battling the cult's high-priestess, Kassandra.

Considered a genius, albeit with rogue tendencies, his funding was cut when it was revealed he was experimenting on infant humans. Unable to find employment after this, Gross was forced underground, using common street thugs to steal the funding for his research.</p><p>Gross created several subjects with superpowers, with Prime and Elven as his best achievements. However both reject him as they seen how deranged Gross was. In a battle between Duey and Prime, Gross was hurt and to survive Gross went underthe same treatment he used on his experiments, creating a Prime like body for himself. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Pavane was a mutant that lived in the same area as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\" href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" slug=\"quicksilver\">Quicksilver</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\" href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" slug=\"scarlet-witch\">Scarlet Witch</a>, and he ended up developing a crush on Wanda. Pietro, being the overly protective brother that he was, shielded his sister and prevented Pavane from interacting with her (this was most likely because they were on their own after having to leave behind their surrogate parents). Desperate, Pavane used his mutant ability to fire bolts of lightning and sabotaged a boat ride the two siblings had, thinking that him saving Wanda would get him into Pietro's good graces. This didn't of course. With Quicksilver eventually taking off for America, Pavane turned his jealousy into full blown hatred and wanted revenge on the speedster.</p><p>He moved to the Transian part of the city, where he eventually settled down with a woman and they produced three offspring: Ampere, who inherited his father's power; Brawler, who developed super strength; and Wanda, who had two sets of eyes and remarkable eyesight. Pavane's wife eventually died due to the bigotry in the area, but no matter what, he was still bent on taking Pietro down. To ensure this, he taught all three of his children to hate Quicksilver. This is when the two paths crossed again.</p><p>Pietro, having recovered from a recent attack by Exodus, decided to take a brisk walk to get everything off of his mind, but he came across Ampere, who was being physically assaulted. Quicksilver grabbed Ampere and ran off with him, but Ampere coldly said that the second he leaves, they were just going to come back. He then ran off, while Quicksilver called for a taxi cab. The driver had a distinct resemblance to Pavane, but nevertheless, he dropped Quicksilver off at a spot to get a drink. It was then he came across Ampere again, only this time the boy used his lightning powers on his attackers, also blinding Pietro. Still barely able to see, he goes into the bar asking about the recent disturbance when the bartender notices that Pietro is also foreign. This leads to a brawl and the people in the bar go after him, but are chased off by the appearance of the \"Circle of Pavane.\" Wanda lead Quicksilver to Pavane, where he explained his hatred for the speedster and thought that he came to America just to be successful and famous and didn't want any mutant from his past to bug him. Pietro looks at him dumbfounded, not realizing that Pietro himself <i>was</i> a mutant. He then proceeded to order his two sons to attack Pietro, leaving him incapacitated. Pavane and Ampere intended to destroy the building to leave no trace but their power was too much and the entire building began to fall apart. Brawler, realizing that there was little hope, had a change of heart and freed Quicksilver, who used his super speed to put out the fire. Unfortunately, part of the structure collapsed on top of Ampere, knocking him out cold and Pavane thought he was dead. As a gesture of kindness and true heroics, Pietro grabbed Ampere and vowed to take him to a hospital but could barely see. He asked Wanda to be his guide due to her sight abilities.</p><p>At the hospital, Pavane and his other two children stand around Ampere frantically, wondering if he will be okay, to which the doctors say they are unsure. They also add that Pavane owes a lot to the man who saved his son, and who he called his arch-enemy: Quicksilver. Pietro looked at Pavane and said the debt could easily be repaid. He then shared his own story of prejudice and added that Pavane taught his children hate, and that was unforgivable. With this, Pavane looked at Quicksilver with understanding and his hatred of the speedster vanished.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Pavane was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41787\" href=\"/joey-cavalieri/4040-41787/\" slug=\"joey-cavalieri\">Joey Cavalieri</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-14331\" href=\"/grant-miehm/4040-14331/\" slug=\"grant-miehm\">Grant Miehm</a> in 1994 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2128\" href=\"/the-avengers/4050-2128/\" slug=\"the-avengers\">The Avengers</a> # 377.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Pavane is a mutant with the ability to control and fire bolts of lightning from both of his hands. Not only does this damage, the light by it is blinding and could render a foe helpless.</p><p>It is unknown if he or his children remained powered post M-Day.</p>",

    "deck": "Agent Norris is a vampire in the 30 Days of Night series who does scouting and information retrieval by posing as an FBI agent.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Dark Days</h2><p>Before becoming a Vampire Agent Norris was a member of the FBI.  At some point he was turned by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48406\" href=\"/lilith/4005-48406/\" slug=\"lilith\">Lilith</a> and became one of her followers.  Norris began to stalk <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47982\" href=\"/stella-olemaun/4005-47982/\" slug=\"stella-olemaun\">Stella Olemaun</a> during her book tour.  Stella had sent shock-waves through the vampire community by releasing a book on the already embarrassing incident in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-48407\" href=\"/barrow/4020-48407/\" slug=\"barrow\">Barrow</a>, Alaska.  Using his FBI training, he continued to surveil  Stella, and later also <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48465\" href=\"/judith-ali/4005-48465/\" slug=\"judith-ali\">Judith Ali</a> who had come forward to Stella with proof of vampire existence.</p><p>One evening when Judith was alone in her room, Norris showed up asking questions about the vampires.  Judith realized that Norris was himself a vampire, but it was too late.  Norris' superhuman speed allowed him to put a bullet through her head at point-blank range before she was able to fire a shot.</p><p>Norris fled the scene with Judith's evidence to bring back to Lilith.  He was quickly chased by Stella and her bodyguards.  They took a jump in their SUV and landed on Norris' car.  Pinned between the two vehicles, Judith shot Norris through the head.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Return to Barrow</h2><p>Norris would survived the incident and eventually heal.  Lilith was killed by Stella soon after Norris was shot, leaving a void in his existence.  Not understanding exactly what his purpose was without his mistress, Norris sought out Judith's informant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48485\" href=\"/george/4005-48485/\" slug=\"george\">George</a> in Louisiana hoping for information that could help him understand himself.  Despite his connection to Lilith Norris was a low-level lackey and did not fully understand vampire society or being a vampire.  At some points he may have even eaten bugs for sustenance.</p><p>Breaking through George's front door, Norris tied up George and tried to extract information from him.  Norris physically abused George and hoped that lack of drugs would force him to talk.  George simply kept begging for a hit.  Fear coupled with intense withdraw made George useless to Norris.  Finally tired of waiting Norris grabbed George and big his neck.  George quickly turned and told Norris everything he needed to know.  George explained that vampires formed a wide network with safe-houses everywhere.  He also told Norris that what he had been feeling was the thoughts of the other vampires pulling him back to Barrow for something big.  George and Norris traveled to Barrow together.</p><p>Arriving in Alaska Norris and George met up with the leader of the next big attack on Barrow, Werner.  With the vampire elders dead there was a lack of leadership among vampires, and Werner was interested in stepping up to the responsibility.  With Norris' information and training, Werner gladly accepted them into his ranks.</p><p>Shortly after arriving they found <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48429\" href=\"/dane/4005-48429/\" slug=\"dane\">Dane</a> regaining consciousness against a tree.  Dane had traveled to Barrow with two other vampires who were ripped apart by something that moved so fast that Dane couldn't track it.  Norris didn't believe Dane, and could smell Stella's scent on him.  Without further proof, Dane was left for the first assault on Barrow.  When the wave ended and the vampires retreated to the woods to regroup George mentioned the rumors that Stella Olemaun not only may have had a vampire accomplice in the killing of Lilith, but that they were also lovers.  Knowing this Norris called out Dane in front of Werner and put a bullet through his head.</p><p>During the next assault on the town Norris would provide Werner with tactical advice, and the group would ambush one of the guard towers.  Norris led a small group of vampires to Stella Olemaun's old house to where the young <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48543\" href=\"/marcus-kitka/4005-48543/\" slug=\"marcus-kitka\">Marcus Kitka</a> had hidden.  Norris entered the house and was able to locate Marcus hiding in a closet.  Norris smiled as he opened the door to the quivering child, but his smile quickly left when he heard a familiar voice over his shoulder greeting him.  The now-vampire Stella Olemaun who had been slowly picking off vampires with her husband <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47928\" href=\"/eben-olemaun/4005-47928/\" slug=\"eben-olemaun\">Eben Olemaun</a> attacked Norris and through him out the front window.  Meanwhile Marcus' father <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48542\" href=\"/brian-kitka/4005-48542/\" slug=\"brian-kitka\">Brian Kitka</a> was standing outside surrounded by vampires when Agent Norris landed in front of him.  Kitka removed the pin from a grenade and threw it on Norris, killing him.</p>",

Jennifer managed to get Linda involved, reassuring her that it was innocent harmless and fun. Things got rather serious when Jennifer attempted to then successfully summoned <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\" href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\">Mephisto.</a> She offered Linda to Mephisto. When Linda arrived home and realized what was happening, she tried to escape but was trapped by burning flame and fire. Linda was bound and stabbed with a special sacrificial blade, thus making her a bride of Satan or in this case, Mephisto. At first she was forced to become loyal and slavish to her new master, but with time she had gained more control and consciousness and it was with that time that she eventually became Witch Woman.          <br /><br /><h2>Creation</h2>Witch Woman is a <a data-ref-id=\"4010-31\" href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\">Marvel comics</a> character and she was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-43812\" href=\"/gary-friedrich/4040-43812/\">Gary Friedrich</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-4016\" href=\"/tom-sutton/4040-4016/\">Tom Sutton.</a><br /> <br /><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Witch Woman could generate, control, and manipulate hell fire. She could project them, redirect, and even construct flames into shapes.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The son of Howard Stark Sr., Howard Stark was born in Richford, <a href=\"/new-york-state/4020-56310/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56310\">New York</a>. An avid and brilliant inventor from a young age, he was heavily involved in <a href=\"/stark-industries/4060-56840/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56840\">Stark Industries</a>. He married <a href=\"/maria-stark/4005-76485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76485\">Maria Collins Carbonell</a>, and the pair had one son, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a>. An alcoholic, he and his son had a difficult relationship, and he rarely expressed much affection for the boy. He was killed alongside his wife in an apparent accident that may have been orchestrated by <a href=\"/v-battalion/4060-22646/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-22646\">V-Battalion</a> or <a href=\"/roxxon/4060-56010/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56010\">Roxxon</a>. Their deaths inspired their son to take control of the business and eventually become Iron Man.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Howard Stark was created by <a href=\"/archie-goodwin/4040-42923/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42923\">Archie Goodwin</a> and <a href=\"/don-heck/4040-6609/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6609\">Don Heck </a>and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man-28-the-controller-lives/4000-10955/\">Iron Man #28</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Wars</h3><p>Stark works with the government during both the First and Second World Wars, providing technical and scientific assistance in a variety of projects. This includes the <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> project, the Arsenal robots, and the <a href=\"/manhattan-project/4055-56537/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56537\">Manhattan Project</a>. His involvement in the latter drew the attention of <a href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\">German</a> agents. The <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> orchestrates the abductions of both Stark and his wife, and tortures the pair to gain information about the Project. The pair resist the torture, and are rescued by Captain America, <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky Barnes</a>, and the <a href=\"/howling-commandos/4060-32653/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32653\">Howling Commandos</a>. He also developed the <a href=\"/arsenal/4005-56297/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56297\">Arsenal</a> robot at some point.</p><h3>Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.</h3><p>Following the Second World War, Stark became involved in working with <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">The Shield</a>. The totality of his involvement with S.H.I.E.L.D. remains shrouded in mystery; he was partnered with <a href=\"/nathaniel-richards/4005-7221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7221\">Nathaniel Richards</a>, with whom he carried out numerous missions. Known missions include escorting new recruit <a href=\"/leonid/4005-70429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70429\">Leonid</a> to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s <a href=\"/rome/4020-56220/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56220\">Rome</a> base, and fighting the <a href=\"/nikola-tesla/4005-71711/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71711\">Night Machine</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Stark has no known superhuman abilities. He possesses a genius level intellect and is particularly skilled in the areas of science and inventing.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>House of M</h3><p>Stark did not die, but instead passed control of the company to his son when he turns 16. He retires, but continues working on inventions with his son and others, working on the <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels</a> with <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\">Forge</a> and <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Hank McCoy</a>, creating a powered suit capable of fighting Sentinels with Tony, and working on the <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a> Project. He is involved in resistance to <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutant</a> rule, secretly programming the Sentinels and Visions to work for him. He is killed by <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>.</p><h3>Noir</h3><p>Believed killed by <a href=\"/third-reich/4060-49867/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49867\">Nazi</a> agents, Stark is captured and chemically brainwashed by the Nazis. He takes the identity of <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\">Baron Zemo</a> and works to create war machines for the Nazis. He is killed in the destruction of <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/4005-4662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4662\">Baron von Strucker's</a> airship, which is destroyed by Iron Man.</p><h3>Ultimate Universe</h3><p>When his second wife Maria dies giving birth to their son Antonio, Stark creates a bio-armour to save the boy's life. He does his best to protect his son, rescuing him when he is abducted by <a href=\"/zebediah-stane/4005-83031/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83031\">Zebediah Stane</a>, and transferring him to a different school when school bullies are hired to kill him. He is later framed by <a href=\"/obadiah-stane/4005-31197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31197\">Obadiah Stane</a> for the murder of Stane's father, and is arrested. He is almost killed by a hypnotized guard, but manages to escape with his life. After recovering he is again attacked by guards, and escapes custody. He is aided by Tony, who reveals the <a href=\"/loni-stark/4005-83032/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83032\">Loni Stane</a>, Howard's ex-wife, might be responsible for everything. They travel to <a href=\"/utah/4020-55826/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55826\">Utah</a> to find Loni. En route their helicopter is attacked and Howard is captured. Loni explains her machinations and shoots Howard in the chest in order to force Tony to take off his suit. He does and she shoots him but he survives and the pair fight, with Tony defeating her. Stark and his son are rescued by federal agents.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4><strong><a href=\"/iron-man-2/4025-733/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-733\">Iron Man 2 (2010)</a></strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1736890-iron_man_2_howard_stark_johnslattery_560x282.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1736890\" data-ratio=\"0.50357142857143\" data-width=\"560\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1736890-iron_man_2_howard_stark_johnslattery_560x282.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1736890\"><img alt=\"John Slattery as Howard\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/59326/1736890-iron_man_2_howard_stark_johnslattery_560x282.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1736890-iron_man_2_howard_stark_johnslattery_560x282.jpg 560w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/59326/1736890-iron_man_2_howard_stark_johnslattery_560x282.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/59326/1736890-iron_man_2_howard_stark_johnslattery_560x282.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>John Slattery as Howard</figcaption></figure><p>Howard Stark appears as a posthumous character depicted in a film reel which he left behind for his son Tony Stark.

    "deck": "Elder Demon was an immensly powerful demon who wanted to destroy the universe once free. Also the foe of White Raven and Silver Surfer.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2><p>The Demon known as Elder Demon was imprisoned in a crystal by an unnamed alien race and used as their power source. His power was so vast he powered the whole civilization for and unnamed amount of time.  Eventually their comet passed close enough to the area where the two beings <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" slug=\"galactus\">Galactus</a> and Thanos both heard of its great power.  Galactus sent the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\" href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" slug=\"silver-surfer\">Silver Surfer</a> out to retrieve the crystal while <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\" href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" slug=\"thanos\">Thanos</a> sent out <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48276\" href=\"/white-raven/4005-48276/\" slug=\"white-raven\">White Raven</a> to also try to retrieve it. The Silver Surfer beat White Raven to the area where he met the last member of the alien race. The Silver Surfer asked the being for the crystal. The alien being, who was the last survivor, gave the crystal to Silver Surfer without an argument and with much happiness. The White Raven eventually arrived and killed the last alien survivor, killing him before the Surfer’s eyes. As the alien died in the Surfers arms he told the Surfer that he was happy to be free, to be released to death. While all this was happening the crystal dropped, releasing the powerful Elder Demon. The Surfer, although angry at White Raven for her murderous act, saved her by bringing her out of the battle. The Surfer then came back and battled the demon. The Surfer's attacks were useless as Elder Demon just shrugged off his attacks. Eventually White Raven came back with her ship and impaled it into the side of Elder Demon, killing him.  She later explained that she used the energy of the exploding ship which caused a chain reaction, ultimately making Elder Demon's own energy consume him. </p><h2>Creation</h2>Elder Demon is a Marvel comic book character created by writer Ron Marz and artist Claudio Castellini. The character first appears in Silver Surfer: Dangerous Artifacts #1 released in 1996. <br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Elder Demon exhibited high invulnerability by shrugging off the power cosmic from the Silver Surfer.  He also demonstrated his strength to be at the Class 100 level of power. He could focus energy stored up inside him into destructive eye blasts. Lastly it can be said that Elder Demon obviously possessed great power for a being like Galactus to have wanted it for himself.</p>",

Later on Melody become the second in command at the same company, and seems to have completely change her personality. She went from being a flirty, sweet, wide eyed scientist to a pushy, bossy, ill-tempered business woman. She ends up pushing Beetle around like he was a complete Melvin and even trashing his office because he was letting his work slide a little bit. Yes, that's right she trashed the office of her boss and boyfriend for not doing his work. She goes so far as to tip over the table in his office.</p><h2>Personality Change</h2><p>The personality change and position change of this character seems to be a decision of the writers. It is never explained in the story why she changed so dramatically. It is as if she was a completely different person. Her hair looked different, she was drawn different dressed different and and acted completely out of her original character.</p>",

They would often collaborate when Ted was in Chicago. <br/> <br/>One such collaboration ended badly in many ways.  Murray needed help from Ted to try and merge a sample of prometheum.  Unknown to both men the prometheum was being followed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19089\" href=\"/doctor-alchemy/4005-19089/\" slug=\"doctor-alchemy\">        Dr. Alchemy</a> who attacked <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56880\" href=\"/kord-incorporated/4020-56880/\" slug=\"kord-incorporated\">         K.O.R.D. Incorporated</a> with the help of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-6889\" href=\"/madmen/4060-6889/\" slug=\"madmen\">       Madmen</a> to steal it.  Dr. Alchemy was able to steal a piece of it and he merged it to his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-51139\" href=\"/philosophers-stone/4055-51139/\" slug=\"philosophers-stone\">      Philosopher's Stone</a>.  He then tried to mege himself to the stone and it worked for a short time but Dr. Alchemy was unable to control his power and went to S.T.AR. labs to cure himself.  In the attempt he transformed presumably killing people into all kinds of things like steel, gold and sulfur.  Blue Beetle stopped him but and Dr. Alchemy turned into a statue of the Philosopher's Stone.   <br/> <br/>Later a sample of the same prometheum turn Curt Calhoun into a villain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47523\" href=\"/prometheus/4005-47523/\" slug=\"prometheus\">    Prometheus</a>.  Both incidents happened from one collaboration.<br/></p> <p><br/><br/> </p>",

Many centuries later, she and <a href=\"/kabala/4005-49310/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49310\">Kabala</a> tracked down Purgatori to learn why this had been done to them and they became enraged to learn it was a mistake.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Chastity: Rocked</h3><p>Jade tried to make a play for power on American soil by killing one of the Yakuza leaders there and putting his son in his position, who then would serve her.

But by the twentieth century, she believed that China no longer had its former honor and dignity, and so she tries to restore this by using her supernatural powers to unite the Triad families underneath her, taking control of China itself. She also tries to form an alliance with <a href=\"/dracula/4005-48636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48636\">Dracula</a>, but the plan was averted by Purgatori.</p><p>But Jade begins dreaming of the world thousands of years ago, the time of her true love, Shiro, who loved her despite the fact that she was a vampire. Shiro met his untimely demise at the hands of the dragon/human sorcerer Pai Lung, otherwise known as The White Dragon. Pai Lung did this seeking stores of an occult of ancient days, knowledge of this that was passed down to Jade by her father. Jade then proceeded to kill the White Dragon, and using the volumes of knowledge provided by the occult, she became a master of sorcery.</p><p>Thanks to these dreams, she longs for Shiro again and feels her loss of humanity. Yet she still has small comfort in the form of her beautiful, mute assassin, <a href=\"/silence/4005-56954/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56954\">Silence</a>. The dreams are monitored by the Kuei, an agency that seeks to destroy the Triads, and she has become their main target.</p><p>Mr. Ko, the leader of the Kuei, is obsessed with bringing her demise and not only has he sent his agents to destroy her, they have also used her dreams to create a cybernetic version of The White Dragon, her enemy of old. But the old sorcerer had preserved his essence through magic and it seemed her had resided in Jade's mind for millenia lurking in wait for a time to get his revenge. And so it was that when an agent of the Kuei, Dreamer delved into Jade's mind and touched the dragon, Pai Lung learned of the cybernetic dragon and left Jade's mind using Dreamer's to get into the cybernetic version of himself. So now this cybernetic dragon has become the mighty sorcerer of ancient times, returning to destroy Jade.</p><p>Jade met her new lover in the form of Chiang (a man who shared the appearance of Shiro), and though Silence was suspicious the two fell in love. He eventually was revealed to be a Kuei agent whose face had been reconstructed to resemble Shiro's but his love for Jade surpassed his allegiance to the Kuei and he told her their secrets, vowing to stay true to her. Jade then takes the fight to the Pai Lung, while Chiang steals a virus to trap the dragons essence in its cybernetic form. While trapped, Pai Lung is destroyed by technology and sorcery. Jade turns Mr. Ko into a vampire who now is eager to follow her lead, and thus Kuei joins Jade's ranks.</p><h3>Jade's Redemption</h3><p>Now that the dragon problem has been resolved, Jade again starts on her goal to unite all China. She attacks few remaining free families who are trying to grow in power by allying themselves with American Triads. She learns the name of the Triad family there and takes a trip to America. She attacks some of the lower men of American Triads to ease her search for Johnny Hsia, the leader of the family. When Jade attack the Hsia's mansion she is surprised by a warrior called Iron Racer. When the fight isn't going like they planned, Jade retreats to prepare herself to face the armored warrior. Going through Triad's men, Jade learns that a croup named Progeny is responsible for the Iron Racer's creation and it is designed to kill vampires. Silence infiltrates the Progeny headquarters and leads the Iron Racer to Jade. Iron Racer attacks Jade with full force, but it is Silence who takes the stake to save Jade. Jade stops fighting and tends to Silence, that made Iron Racer rethink her stand on vampires. Jade promises to get the girls trapped inside the Iron Racer free. Their bonding is however cut short by other Iron Racers. Having defeated the forces sent to destroy them, Jade attacks Progeny's HQ in full force. Coincidentally Johnny Hsia has taken over the organization. Jade uses the opportunity to rid herself of the headache Hsia caused. As Jade saved the father of the girl trapped in the Iron Racer armor, and he took over the Progeny, Jade is removed from the list of dangerous vampires. While Jade is in United States, a member of Triad complains of a demon attack. This brings her into conflict with <a href=\"/lady-death/4005-1847/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1847\">Lady Death</a>, but soon they realize that they are not enemies and destroy the demon together. After that Jade returns to China to finish her task of uniting it.</p><p>Jade once again returned to America when a drug Xorcist turned up on her territory. She sought information in the nightclub where <a href=\"/oblivia/4005-52611/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52611\">Oblivia</a> worked. When all the drug users turned to werewolves, Jade joined forces with Oblivia, and few other arrivals: Lady Death, <a href=\"/bad-kitty/4005-49106/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49106\">Bad Kitty</a>, Chastity and <a href=\"/morgan-gallows/4005-52607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52607\">Morgan Gallows</a> among them. In the fight Silence is abducted, and Jade agrees to join an Alliance formed to defeat <a href=\"/lucifer/4005-49221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49221\">Lucifer</a>. At Lady Death's sanctum, Jade is reunited with Purgatori, but they agree to set aside their rivalries in the name of common goal.</p>",

Silverbolt alongside <a href=\"/jetfire/4005-41909/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41909\">Jetfire</a> tried to stop <a href=\"/starscream/4005-7402/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7402\">Starscream</a> from getting to the Decagon though suffered injuries and failed to prevent that. <a href=\"/optimus-prime/4005-6467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6467\">Optimus Prime</a> in the wake of <a href=\"/cybertron/4020-41978/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41978\">Cybertron</a> shutting down its core ordered the evacuation of the planet by the <a href=\"/autobots/4060-40489/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40489\">Autobots</a>. <a href=\"/megatron/4005-4103/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4103\">Megatron</a> in response used the station above Cybertron to shoot down numerous Autobot ships. Optimus ordered Silverbolt, Jetfire, <a href=\"/air-raid/4005-48563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48563\">Air Raid</a>, and the other <a href=\"/aerialbots/4060-42030/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42030\">Aerialbots</a> against the station. Silverbolt lead the assault and first the team took out the stations cooling systems and after having some words with Megatron who was mostly taking to Jetfire the team took out the Pulse regulator disabling the stations main weapon. When the team realized the station was a Cybertronian named <a href=\"/trypticon/4005-41911/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41911\">Trypticon</a> they changed tactics and destroy his transformation cog forcing him to transform and land. As Trypticon drifted towards Cybertron the Aerialbots took out his jetpack in order to let gravity destroy him. Though Trypticon survived he was taken out by Optimus Primes ground team. Silverbolt was later seen at the site where the Autobots started to build the <a href=\"/ark/4055-55742/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55742\">Ark</a>.</p><h4>Transformers: Fall of Cybertron</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/2552390-wfcsilverbolt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2552390\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2357142857143\" data-width=\"420\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 420px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/2552390-wfcsilverbolt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2552390\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/2552390-wfcsilverbolt.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103617/2552390-wfcsilverbolt.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px\" data-width=\"517\"></a></figure><p>Silverbolt appears during <a href=\"/optimus-prime/4005-6467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6467\">Optimus Prime</a>'s mission inside the <a href=\"/autobots/4060-40489/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40489\">Autobot</a> Base where he was injured and needed <a href=\"/ratchet/4005-7408/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7408\">Ratchet</a> and Optimus' help before dying.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Out of the <a href=\"/aerialbots/4060-42030/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42030\">Aerialbots</a>, his tactics are the most fearless, although some might call them rash and foolish. An excellent tactician, he achieves his goals, even when in the middle of battle. Air Raid and the other Aerialbots were created to give the Autobots a fighting chance against <a href=\"/devastator/4005-11891/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11891\">Devastator</a> by creating the combiner <a href=\"/superion/4005-30488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30488\">Superion</a>. <a href=\"/buster-witwicky/4005-65073/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65073\">Buster Witwicky</a> saw the idea in a dream and informed <a href=\"/optimus-prime/4005-6467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6467\">Optimus Prime</a> and <a href=\"/wheeljack/4005-7403/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7403\">Wheeljack</a>. Air Raid forms Superion's Left leg.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Air Raid was created by Hasbro for The Transformers (1984) Cartoon. He was later added in 1986 to <a href=\"/the-transformers/4050-3370/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3370\">The Transformers</a> Marvel comic by writer <a href=\"/bob-budiansky/4040-10224/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-10224\">Bob Budiansky</a> and editors <a href=\"/mike-carlin/4040-41784/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41784\">Mike Carlin</a> and <a href=\"/jim-shooter/4040-40450/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40450\">Jim Shooter</a>. Hasbro didn't register the name Air Raid until October 2003.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Generation 1 Continuity</h3><h4>Marvel Comics</h4><p>After Buster Witwicky's vision the Autobots discovered a way to reverse engineer the technology the <a href=\"/decepticons/4060-40490/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40490\">Decepticons</a> used to create Devastator. Working off the blueprints recorded by <a href=\"/bumblebee/4005-30511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30511\">Bumblebee</a>, Wheeljack successfully created Air Raid and the Aerialbots. During their first test run, the Autobots were alerted to a Decepticon operation at Hoover Dam. The Aerialbots were the only team fast enough to reach the location in time, and so Prime hesitantly sent the Aerialbots into battle before their programming was completed.</p><p>Air Raid proved to be the most effective of the new Aerialbots in battle. When his fellow Aerialbots where under fire by the <a href=\"/seekers/4060-48451/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48451\">Seekers</a>, Air Raid broke up their formation and damaged <a href=\"/ramjet/4005-41855/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41855\">Ramjet</a>'s nose-cone with his torque rifle, allowing the other Aerialbots to regroup.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2559748-air_raid_both_modes.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2559748\" data-ratio=\"2.1438172043011\" data-width=\"744\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 744px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:214.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2559748-air_raid_both_modes.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2559748\"><img alt=\"G1 Air Raid\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2559748-air_raid_both_modes.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2559748-air_raid_both_modes.jpg 744w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15659/2559748-air_raid_both_modes.jpg 480w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2559748-air_raid_both_modes.jpg 298w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" data-width=\"298\"></a><figcaption>G1 Air Raid</figcaption></figure><p>The Aerialbots drove the Decepticons away, giving them time to focus on the energy siphon. In order to destroy the device <a href=\"/silverbolt/4005-48561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48561\">Silverbolt</a> commanded they merge into Superion. However <a href=\"/bombshell/4005-48454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48454\">Bombshell</a>'s cerebro-shell was controlling a human Ricky Vasquez, and forced him to fire <a href=\"/megatron/4005-4103/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4103\">Megatron</a> at Superion. Unfortunately the majority of the Aerialbots were not programmed to protect human life, and Superion saw him as a potential threat. Ricky fought against the Bombshell's control, and Silverbolt fought inside Superion's mind with the other Aerialbots to protect the human. In order to save him, Silverbolt was forced to disengage Superion's combined mode. Luckily Ricky was able to resist the cerebro-shell and used Megatron to destroy the energy siphon.</p><p>After the almost disaster at Hoover Dam, Optimus Prime had the Aerialbots shut down and their original programming erased. He then inputted their fully-programmed personalities using the <a href=\"/matrix-of-leadership/4055-55759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55759\">Matrix</a>. During their next battle with <a href=\"/menasor/4005-41941/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41941\">Menasor</a> as Superion, the Aerialbots were attacked by <a href=\"/circuit-breaker/4005-15970/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15970\">Circuit Breaker</a>, deactivated, and captured by RAAT. Luckily they were later freed.</p><p>When <a href=\"/grimlock/4005-6449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6449\">Grimlock</a> took over the Autobots, Air Raid and the other Aerialbots left. When a distress call came from Buster it was Air Raid, <a href=\"/skydive/4005-42021/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42021\">Skydive</a>, and <a href=\"/fireflight/4005-41999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41999\">Fireflight</a> who were the first to respond. Buster had been a prisoner of the Decepticons for over a year. This led the Autobot and Decepticon forces to battle with <a href=\"/starscream/4005-7402/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7402\">Starscream</a>, who had acquired the power of the Underbase. The Aerialbots were his first victims, when he blasted them with the Underbase's cosmic power.</p><p>When the Autobots left Earth Air Raid was with the other deactivated Autobots aboard the Ark. Air Raid and the Aerialbots were eventually revived by the Nucleon super-energy that Grimlock and the <a href=\"/dinobots/4060-41692/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41692\">Dinobots</a> recovered from Hydrus Four.</p><h4>Marvel UK</h4><p>Air Raid and <a href=\"/beachcomber/4005-41994/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41994\">Beachcomber</a> rush to defend <a href=\"/metroplex/4005-41831/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41831\">Autobot City</a> from <a href=\"/quintessons/4060-55924/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55924\">Quintesson</a> invaders. They were quickly overwhelmed, and were forced to retreat and get reinforcements.</p><p>In the 1992 Annual, Air Raid joined Silverbolt and Skydive in an assault on Hydrus Four. They infiltrated a medical center occupied by the Decepticons in order to rescue the Dinobots and prevent the resurrection of Megatron.</p><h4>IDW Publishing</h4><p>Air Raid has not yet appeared in <a href=\"/transformers-regeneration-one/4050-50452/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-50452\">Regeneration One</a>.</p><h3>IDW Continuity</h3><h4>Autocracy</h4><p>The Aerialbots respond to Optimus' call for additional support against the Decepticons and fought against the Seekers.</p><h4>Chaos</h4><p>Air Raid was among the Autobots fighting against <a href=\"/galvatron/4005-41902/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41902\">Galvatron</a>'s army on <a href=\"/cybertron/4020-41978/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41978\">Cybertron</a>.

He along with the other Aerialbots later deserted Bumblebee's fledgling government.</p><h2><span>Powers &amp; Weaknesses</span></h2><p>Air Raid can fly at speeds of up to Mach 5 and has a range of 1500 miles. In his alt-mode he can shoot air-to-air heat-seeking missiles and, in robot-mode, carries a high pressure torque rifle. He combines with his fellow Aerialbots to form the giant robot know as Superion. Air Raid is reckless and often exposes himself to greater odds than he can reasonably expect to handle.</p><h2><span>Characteristics</span></h2><ul><li><b>Allegiance:</b> <span>Autobot</span></li><li><span><strong>Sub Group</strong>: Aerialbot</span></li><li><span><strong>Function:</strong> Warrior/Scout</span></li><li><strong>Alt-Modes:</strong> <span>Cybertronian Jet,</span> <span><span>F-15 Eagle Fighter</span>, B1-B Bomber,</span> Boeing E-767, F117A Nighthawk, F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning II, Antonov An-225, WWII Fighter Plane</li><li><b>Color Schemes:</b> Red/Blue/Black (G1, Animated), Silver/Burgundy (Games), Black (3H), Red/Gold (Toys), Green (Film, DW), Silver/Red (Toys), Black/Blue (G2)</li></ul><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Marvel Comics</h3><h4>Generation 2</h4><p>Air Raid and the other Aerialbots were seen after the Autobots had retreated to an asteroid.

Air Raid battled the Cybertronians again blasting them out of the sky to the waiting Dinobots on the ground.</p><h3>3H Productions</h3><h4>Dreamwave Publications</h4><h4>Transformers/G.I. Joe</h4><p>While not named individually the Aerialbots are seen in several issues. They were reconfigured WWII fighter planes.</p><h4>War Within</h4><p>Air Raid and the Aerialbot are part of a subgroup called combiners, able to merge to form Superion. Because Superion and the other combiners caused wide spread destruction, the Crisis Intervention Accords were signed by the various factions, prohibiting the use of combiners. The members of each combiner could either join different factions separately or remain together as a neutral faction. It is unknown what Air Raid and the Aerialbots chose.</p><h4>Generation 1</h4><p>Air Raid and the Aerialbots were part of the crew that journeyed to Earth on the original Ark to defeat the Decepticons. When they were ordered to leave Earth, they were deactivated and put on the Ark II. Disastrously Ark II exploded in mid-air on its journey back to Cybertron. In reality the ship was sabotaged by the rogue engineer turned arms dealer Adam Rook, known as Lazarus, and General Robert Hallo. They planned to reprogram the Transformers and use them as weapons in the United States military. Fortunately Aerialbots were some of the Transformers who were not recovered by Lazarus. They remained immobile in the Arctic waters until reactivated by Optimus Prime and the <a href=\"/matrix-of-leadership/4055-55759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55759\">Matrix of Creation</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2805538-primedirective6_airraid_punches_starscream.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2805538\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.48177496038035\" data-width=\"631\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 631px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2805538-primedirective6_airraid_punches_starscream.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2805538\"><img alt=\"Air Raid vs. Starscream\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117127/2805538-primedirective6_airraid_punches_starscream.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2805538-primedirective6_airraid_punches_starscream.jpg 631w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117127/2805538-primedirective6_airraid_punches_starscream.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117127/2805538-primedirective6_airraid_punches_starscream.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Air Raid vs. Starscream</figcaption></figure><p>Air Raid and the Aerialbots in their Superion form, battled the Decepticons in the Northwest Territories of Canada, and San Francisco. During the their first battle, Superion was broken down into the individual Aerialbots by the Seekers, and Devastator hoisted Air Raid in his hand in triumph. Megatron tried and failed to convince Optimus Prime to join his cause. The Autobots then battled the Decepticons, where Air Raid battled against Starscream. Unfortunately General Hallo betrayed the Autobots and launched a nuclear missile at San Francisco to destroy all of the Transformers. Before Optimus Prime could stop them, the Aerialbots formed Superion and intercepted the missile. Superion and the Aerialbots, were destroyed in stopping the missile. The remains of Air Raid and the other Aerialbots are recovered for study by the Earth Defense Command.</p><h4>Universe</h4><p>Not seen in the comic but was released as a toy. His packaging states that Air Raid is a aerial bot flier, but he was sent to take care of a water-borne Decepticon Storm Surge.</p><h3>IDW Publishing</h3><h4><span><span>Revenge of the Fallen Movie Prequel: Defiance</span></span></h4><p>Before coming to earth Air Raid was a member of <a href=\"/cybertron/4020-41978/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41978\">Cybertron</a>'s Science Division. When an ancient relic is uncovered, they are attacked by aliens from the Eshems Nebula. Megatron in turn declares martial law and demanded the full cooperation of every Cybertronian. Air Raid was among the Autobots that obeyed Optimus's command for them to not abandon their traditions and beliefs. When Optimus Prime and his followers were declared traitors, civil war erupted across the planet. Air Raid joined the Autobots and lead other Aerialbots in battle.</p><h4>Reign of Starscream</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2805260\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74736842105263\" data-width=\"570\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 570px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2805260\"><img alt=\"Death of Air Raid\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg 570w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg 480w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death of Air Raid\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg 570w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg 480w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117127/2805260-reignofstarscream3_airraid_smokescreen_die.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death of Air Raid</figcaption></figure><p>After the defeat of Megatron on Earth, Air Raid was part of a small Autobot unit led by <a href=\"/arcee/4005-44364/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44364\">Arcee</a> to track down Starscream on Mars.

When the Aerialbots saw Megatron deactivate <a href=\"/elita-one/4005-57232/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57232\">Ariel</a>, <a href=\"/dion/4005-81802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81802\">Dion</a> and <a href=\"/optimus-prime/4005-6467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6467\">Orion Pax</a>.

He fights for the devil's amusement. He is the future ruler of Stygain, hell's prison. At first he only possesses the third volume of the book of the dead. In order to rule Stygain he must obtain all three volumes, But in order to do this he must kill the Embalmer and his step-father Paul Bearer. Paul Bearer was easy enough to dispose off. He has his servant Lotan, a werewolf type demon, sniff him out. When the two come to Paul Bearer's dwelling Lotan betrays the Undertaker and attacks him. Little to Paul, Lotan, or the Undertaker's knowledge The Undertaker's half-brother,Kane, and half-sister Jezebelle, were there. <a href=\"/kane/4005-50235/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50235\"> Kane</a> doesn't say much. He is the muscle of the two. He killed Lotan quickly and then blasted Paul Bearer out of a window using his ability to manipulate fire. This allows The Undertaker to take the First volume of the book of the dead, but he was still missing the crucial Second book. The Second volume of the Book of the Dead was in the hands of a man who broke into Stygain and freed demons inorder for his bidding. This man was the Embalmer. He had many of his demons in the World Wrestling Federation, where Kane was also in. The Embalmer possesed the ability of manipulating flames aswell which is how he originally escaped the Undertaker. Undertaker was shot in the back after killing a dozen demons and fell out of the window of the Embalmer's scyscraper. The Deadman holds the Books that show the Past and the Future, But lacks the Present. This is why the Embalmer is so dangerous.</p><h3>WWE Superstars (Super Genius Comics)</h3><p>The Undertaker own a tattoo parlor in <a href=\"/titan-city/4020-59310/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59310\">Titan City</a>, called \"The Funeral Parlor\". He is contacted by <a href=\"/cm-punk/4005-95369/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-95369\">CM Punk</a> to get him on his side. The Undertaker declines, claiming he doesn't take sides.</p><h2>Wrestling Career</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37908/1091069-319133_180864_undertaker_super_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1091069\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 329px\" data-ratio=\"0.79635258358663\" data-width=\"329\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37908/1091069-319133_180864_undertaker_super_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1091069\"><img alt=\"The Deadman In Action \" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37908/1091069-319133_180864_undertaker_super_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37908/1091069-319133_180864_undertaker_super_1_.jpg 329w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px\" data-width=\"329\"></a><figcaption>The Deadman In Action </figcaption></figure><p>The Undertaker is also known as the Deadman. When wrestling, he is usually billed as coming from Death Valley, and he has traditionally been one of the most dominant forces in the WWE. The Undertaker debuted at the WWE's Survivor Series pay-per-view in 1990 in a match that also featured Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart and Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart. The Undertaker has gone on to establish a prestigious winning streak, as well -- only in his final match at Wrestlemania was he defeated by <a href=\"/brock-lesnar/4005-95843/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-95843\">Brock Lesnar</a>, who was managed by <a href=\"/paul-heyman/4005-95844/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-95844\">Paul Heyman</a>. The Undertaker's career has been unmatched since his debut. Probably one of the most memorable matches in the Deadman's illustrious career was the Hell in a Cell match at King of the Ring in June of 1998. The Undertaker was set to meet <a href=\"/mankind/4005-48571/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48571\">Mankind</a> (Mick Foley) inside the sadistic structure, but Mankind decided to start the match at the top of the structure. When Mankind tried to attack the deadman he missed and fell nearly 20 feet from the top of the cell. After Mankind got back up (now with a supposedly broken arm) both men climbed the structure again. Mankind again slipped up and the phenom choke slammed him through the roof of the cell and down 15 feet to the mat. Mercifully the match ended just minutes later after a tombstone piledriver. After the match Mankind walked away with one tooth missing and a whole in his bottom lip. The Phenom picked up his first victory inside the cell that night.</p><h3>The Streak</h3><p>Undertaker was undefeated at Wrestlemania for 21 years.</p><p>The streak started at Wrestlemania 7 where he wrestled and defeated Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka. It continued at Wrestlemania 8 where he defeated <a href=\"/jake-the-snake-roberts/4005-63706/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63706\">Jake 'The Snake' Roberts</a>.</p><p>He had increased his undefeated streak to 18-0 with his defeat of <a href=\"/shawn-michaels/4005-92440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92440\">Shawn Michaels</a> at Wrestlemania XXVI. Due to the stipulation of the match Shawn Michaels was forced to retire as a result of the loss.</p><p>The following year <a href=\"/triple-h/4005-68598/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68598\">Triple H</a> challenged the Undertaker to avenge his friends loss. However, Triple H failed to beat the Undertaker and the streak moved to 19-0.</p><p>At Wrestlemania 28 Triple H once again challenged the Undertaker at a match in Wrestlemania. This time it was a Hell in the Cell match with Shawn Michaels as a special guest referee. Even with the odds slightly in Triple H's favor he still lost the match and the Undertaker moved to 20-0.</p><p>At Wrestlemania 29 CM Punk challenged the Undertaker. During the build up to the match, CM Punk had stolen the Undertaker's urn which is supposed to be the source of the Undertaker's powers. However, this did not make a difference as Punk still lost and the Undertaker moved to 21-0.</p><p>Finally, at Wrestlemania 30, Brock Lesnar shocked the world by defeating the Undertaker.</p><h3>Banishment</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15785/316820-155233-undertaker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316820\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 343px\" data-ratio=\"1.2390670553936\" data-width=\"343\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15785/316820-155233-undertaker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316820\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" data-width=\"343\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15785/316820-155233-undertaker.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15785/316820-155233-undertaker.jpg 343w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15785/316820-155233-undertaker.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15785/316820-155233-undertaker.jpg 343w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" data-width=\"343\"></noscript></a></figure><p>At One Night Stand <a href=\"/edge/4005-92432/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92432\">Edge</a> did the unthinkable with a little help from his \"La Familia\". Just weeks before the PPV Smackdown GM <a href=\"/vickie-guerrero/4005-95371/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-95371\">Vickie Guerrero</a> decided that if the Undertaker lost the TLC match then he was to be banished from all of the WWE. La Familia interfered giving Edge the upper hand in the match. The Undertaker managed to over come though and beat Edge to a pulp. It wasn't enough though. The Undertaker was just inches away from victory when Edge mustered the strength to push the ladder over sending the phenom down 15 feet and through a table. Edge climbed the ladder and grabbed the World Heavyweight Championship to pick up a win and banish the Undertaker. After Edges act of adultery Vickie Guerrero reinstated the Undertaker and put Edge and the Phenom inside Hell in a Cell at the biggest blockbuster of the year Summer Slam. WIll the Phenom get his vengence or will the Ultimate Opportunist get the upper hand once more? Only Sunday August 17th 2008 will tell.</p><p> </p><h3>Vegetative State</h3><p>Over Memorial day weekend in 2010 Kane discovered that his brother was put in a Vegetative state by unknown assailants (later revealed to be Kane). <a href=\"/kane/4005-50235/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50235\">Kane</a> has vowed vengeance and has launched an investigation to discover who is responsible. It was unknown if the Undertaker would return. However he has come back and vowed to battle Kane at Night of Champions 2010. However, he lost to his brother Kane and went on to battle him at Hell In A Cell, he once again lost due to Paul Bearer betraying him to join forces with Kane.</p>",

Worked in Texas on a loading dock until he became a pro wrestler in the late-80s. First became recognized in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as \"Stunning\" Steve Austin, where he conquered the singles ranks by becoming the WCW Television Champion on a few occasions and the WCW United States Title, he also conquered the WCW Tag-Team ranks along with the late Brian Pillman, collectively known as \"The Hollywood Blondes\" (Austin, at the time, had long blonde hair). Had a falling out with WCW head Eric Bischoff in Mid-1995 when Bischoff fired him over-the phone. Went to Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in late 1995 mostly as a commentator (He did wrestle a few matches, though.) Established himself as a no-nonsense, garbage-mouthed punk. Left ECW and emerged in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as \"The Ringmaster\", along with manager \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted Dibiase. That gimmick was weak and Austin was silenced by WWF Brass because of his reputation. Finally dumped DiBiase and changed his name to \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, shaved his head, and had a gimmick as a Natural-Born Killer (He does strike a close resemblance to Woody Harrelson fron the movie). Started his trash-talking and ass-kicking when he defeated Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts in the final round of the 1996 WWF King of The Ring Tournament, which was where he coined the famous \"AUSTIN 3:16\" while mocking Roberts for his religeous beliefs. Austin 3:16 was a phenomenon. He is the only person to do that other than the great Hulk Hogan who did it did in the 80's with the \"Hulkamania\" phenomenon. Austin 3:16 is about as big as Hulkamania was in the 80's to the mid-90s. Austin conquered the WWF in 1997 when he captured the WWF Intercontinental Title on 2 occasions, the Tag-Team Titles on 2 occasions (with Shawn Michaels and \"Dude Love\" Mick Foley, respectively). And in 1998 when he achieved the ultimate career goal, the WWF World Title on 3 occasions and another Tag-Team Title reign with The Undertaker.</p>",

Reversing the signal, the Autobots learned of a Decepticon plot to steal the energy-converting hydrothermocline. Optimus took the Protectobots to intervene on Megatron and his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41871\" href=\"/combaticons/4060-41871/\" slug=\"combaticons\">Combaticons</a>.</p><p>At the industrial site, a computer programer named Ethan Zachary stepped in and suggested they battle for the hydrothermocline in a virtual game program he had created. With their consent, Zachary uploaded Optimus, Megatron, and the two Combiner Teams into his computer game called Multi-World. Blades was teamed with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48574\" href=\"/groove/4005-48574/\" slug=\"groove\">Groove</a>, and they maneuvered through an area called the Cloud-Steppes, where cities floated on clouds. The Combaticon flyers attacked the Autobots, sending the Groove and a group of Cloud-Steppers falling. Against his better judgement, Blades caught the falling humanoids instead of saving his teammate. This turned out to be in his favor as the Cloud-Steppers assisted the Autobots by blinding the Combaticons, allowing Groove to shoot them down.</p><p>As part of the Protectobots, he was later sent by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6449\" href=\"/grimlock/4005-6449/\" slug=\"grimlock\">Grimlock</a> to track down the defectors <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41905\" href=\"/blaster/4005-41905/\" slug=\"blaster\">Blaster</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30511\" href=\"/bumblebee/4005-30511/\" slug=\"bumblebee\">Goldbug</a>. The team arrested Blaster but then had to fight off an attack from the Combaticons. Blades and his team were saved by Blaster and in return they let him escape.</p><h4>Marvel UK</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2609745-blades_tf_marvel_uk_125_optimus_can_be_a_dick.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2609745\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.7202572347267\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:172.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2609745-blades_tf_marvel_uk_125_optimus_can_be_a_dick.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2609745\"><img alt=\"TF (Marvel UK) #125\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2609745-blades_tf_marvel_uk_125_optimus_can_be_a_dick.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2609745-blades_tf_marvel_uk_125_optimus_can_be_a_dick.jpg 311w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\" data-width=\"311\"></a><figcaption>TF (Marvel UK) #125</figcaption></figure><p>When Grimlock took control of the Autobots, Blades began to consider deserting like Goldbug and Blaster.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Charlotte Pincer started out as a \"Bioengineered Gene-Clone weapon\" designed to look like a nightmare or monster of human myth. In her case she was modeled after a Harpy, a winged half woman half bird creature created by canines from a future alternate timeline. She was completely under control of <a href=\"/dr-alfred-peachbody/4005-48444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48444\">Dr. Alfred Peachbody</a>, a super intelligent talking dog, until Ace and Ryan used ultrasonic sound to sever the connection. This left the Harpy little more than a blank slate, easily led around and directed. Peachbody fled with his “pet boy” Benji, and Penny, Gina, Ace and Ryan took the Harpy with them.</p><h2>New Life</h2><p>The Harpy freed from the mental control of Peachbody was shy, skittish, and completely ignorant of the world. Penny Pincer brought the Harpy into her household with the thought to train her to be a bodyguard for her like Brittany was for Gina Diggers. She realized over time that even though the Harpy appeared fully grown, it had the mind and innocence of a child. At this point is probably when Penny decided to adopt the creature and raise her as her own.</p><p>Penny bought her clothing that allowed for a body covered with feathers with wings sprouting out of her back and taught her how to wear them. She taught her how to speak and interact with others. She hired Brittany to teach the Harpy self defense and enrolled her in school as Charlotte Pincer.</p><p>As of this writing she currently goes to Advanced Public School with her friends Tiffany 'Gia (a hybrid were-cheeta / Krynn with symbiotic nano machines.), Pojo Polotsk (a Were-Bear/Wolf cub) and PeeWee (a gifted child prodigy in DNA resequencing, who used to be one of Gina Diggers rivals). She has mentally advanced to the age of a young teenager, has “noticed” boys, and is doing most of the things a 12 – 14 year old sheltered little girl would do. She has completed her training with Brittany and has taken on the part time role of bodyguard for Penny Pincer.</p>",

    "deck": "Stripe was an alien prince of El Dorado, the city of gold, which was really an extremely large Starship. He is now the husband of Britanny Diggers and a member of Agency Zero.",
    "description": "<p>Stryyp Gia Aka Stripe was the prince of the Kryn race, who lived in a city-ship that had crashed to Earth long ago due to conflict with their rivals, the Atlanteans, leading to a long-burning conflict that finally culminated during Stripe's time, when an Atlantean Gryphon seized control of both City Ships. Stripe, trained in stealth and martial arts, helped overthrow him with the aid of several outsiders, notably <a href=\"/gina-diggers/4005-48412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48412\">Gina Diggers</a> and her sister, and his future wife, <a href=\"/cheetah/4005-48413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48413\">Britanny 'Cheetah' Diggers</a>. With Gryphon overthrown, Stryyp was able to make peace with the Atlantean's true leader, Princess Tyr.</p><p>Time passed and Stripe's relationship with Cheetah deepened, and the two prepared to be married, when the worst news arrived- the Kryn's home planet was under attack and El Dorado was needed to save it. With no time to lose, the still-functional flight sections of the City were launched, leaving only a message behind to inform his fiance what was happening, and Stripe was given the artifacts Gryphon had used in preparation to fight the powerful invaders, the <a href=\"/the-dynasty-of-the-stars/4060-57220/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57220\">Dynasty of the Stars</a>.</p><p>His initial confrontation with the Dynasty went poorly and he was believed dead, but he was saved by the intervention of Archon, the leader of his home-world. She permanently bonded his artifacts to him, allowing him to tap their full power, while at the same time reinforcements arrived from Earth in the form of the three Diggers sisters, <a href=\"/penny-pincer/4005-48590/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48590\">Penny Pincer</a>, and the mighty Vaultron force. Gina was able to figure out how to shut down the Dynasty's own symbionts, technology that worked much like Stripe's artifacts, and combined with Stripe's new abilities and Cheetah's speed, the couple was able to defeat Rao, the leader of the Dynasty, and send them packing.</p><p>Returning to earth, Stripe and Cheetah finally became married, despite some complications involving a jealous Kryn priestess.</p><p>Not long after, Stripe was contacted by <a href=\"/m/4005-9740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9740\">M</a>, a member of the covert superhero group <a href=\"/agency-zero/4060-48437/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48437\">Agency Zero</a>, who expressed interest in his powers gained on his trip, as well as the Kryn's heroic character, and invited him to join the team. After some consideration, Stripe accepted, and joined the organization to aid in the protection of Earth.</p><p>While Stripe was engaging in his first missions, he received good news from his wife- she was pregnant! Now father to the half-werecheetah, half-Kryn Tiffany Gia, Stripe couldn't be happier, but trouble soon brewed. His grandfather in law, who had been turned into the Lich King years before by a spell backfire, sought to claim Tiffany to replenish his power, and whisked daughter and mother to another dimension, the realm of Oblivion, aided by the wererat mastermind Gothwrain. Stripe, Britanny, and their family fought from both sides to regain contact and return Tiffany and Britanny to Earth. Against an array of powerful opposition, they were partially successful- while the Lich King and Gothwrain were defeated, Britanny and Tiffany were stranded in a realm where time worked differently. With the help of the locals who taught her spellcraft, Britanny was able to open a portal and returned Tiffany to Stripe when she was four years old, mere days later from his perspective. Even then, Britanny Diggers Gia herself had to then take the long way home after the portal closed.</p><p>A year later, Britanny finally arrived. The family now reunited, Stripe continues his work with <a href=\"/agency-zero/4060-48437/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48437\">Agency Zero</a>, Britanny continues to help her sister's adventuring, both in between taking care of Tiffany, and on occasion find both their jobs overlap and find themselves fighting side-by-side again.</p><p><strong>ARTIFACT POWERS</strong></p><p>Strype's bond with the Kryn Artifacts grants him numerous powers and abilities beyond his already impressive physical skills. These include, but are not limited too:</p><p><strong>Flame Raker</strong> - Grants Pyrokinesis, as small as a candle light, to as powerful as an incendiary warhead.</p><p><strong>Spectral Talon</strong> - These telekinetic bubbles will rebound physical and kinetic energy back at the source, meaning physical attacks can be rebounded back upon the attacker. He can create many spheres, but has trouble keeping track of more than four at a time at once.</p><p><strong>Phase Runner</strong> - Allows both flight and teleportation. Teleportation is three times Strype's own eyesight, and the artifact also enables him to scan that area, so he'll know where to safely teleport even if he can't see it directly. Flight is up to 86 miles per hour.</p><p><strong>Crown of Ancients</strong> - Enables Strype to create incredibly powerful force fields. A secondary function allows him to petrify living beings into stone, though he will only ever use this as a last resort.</p><p><strong>Gem of Returning</strong> - Allows Strype to nullify the magical power of spells and artifacts, as well as cancel out spell effects, such as the energy which allows summoned creatures to remain manifested. This would include his own artifacts, save for the Crown's own shielding effects protecting them.</p><p><strong>Other</strong> - Strype can call upon the energies of his artifacts to amplify his physical abilities, giving him low-level super strength, speed, durability, and agility. Doing so, however, feeds on his own personal energy, and if he has none to spare, he can force his artifacts to consume his own flesh to maintain the boost. He can also scan items and areas to try and detect their inherent properties, whether they are magical or not.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>From the beginning Penny Pincer and Gina Diggers have competed in the searching for and discovery of lost civilizations, Artifacts, and unsolved Mysteries.</p><p>Penelope Pincer was a Child Prodigy without a serious interest until Archeology. Up to that point she \"dabbled\" in things like becoming a Physician or working Chemistry until she gained a degree. Then she met a true equal in Gina Diggers in a field that actually held her interest. They came across each other the first time in an event only inferred as a confrontation that started their heated competition and the regular trading of Wedgies.</p><figure style=\"width: 710px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060689\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1060689-first_recorded_team_up.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"710\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1060689-first_recorded_team_up.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1060689\"><img alt=\"First recorded Teamup of Penny and Gina\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55253/1060689-first_recorded_team_up.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1060689-first_recorded_team_up.jpg 710w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55253/1060689-first_recorded_team_up.jpg 480w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55253/1060689-first_recorded_team_up.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>First recorded Teamup of Penny and Gina</figcaption></figure><p>They more often than not end up at the same site at the same time and the resulting dust up between the two nerds is entertaining in itself . In most cases one or the other has the advantage and forced the other to back off by either denying aid from a life threatening situation or trading information for freedom.</p><p>A “Wedgie “ is when you hoist someone up by their underwear. This went on for quite a bit in the beginning but tapered off as they got more serious and worked more for than against each other. The “Tit for Tat” would continue until Penny Pincer was convinced by Kevin Koss to bury the hatchet by offering the Digger sisters a loan to cover thousands of dollars in debt interest free. The only catch for Gina was that she would have to spend a four hour shift behind the counter at “Taco Hut”. Penny still wanted to get “the last Lick” by having a few hundred people lined up to come in and order food on her dime – but Gina’s open offer of friendship disarmed her and she took those hundreds to “Pizza Bell” instead.</p><h2>Super Scientist</h2><p>Though their strengths and educations run parallel in many areas of expertise both still have specialties that the other lacks, Penny for example has a Masters in Ballistics and is a Qualified MD and Brain Surgeon. (Things Gina has shown envy on)</p><p>Based on feats she also has degrees in Electronics, Computer Science, Cybernetics, Engineering, Physics, and Chemistry.</p><p>Speaking on “Feats” Penelope has Developed, designed and built Mini subs, Hover carriers, Hovercraft, Jet engines, and Starcraft, (As in a faster than light driven space ship!). She has also developed what could be called advances in Bowcaster technology and has rediscovered and made use in designing Beta technology for everything from “keys” to Bowcasters with unlimited ammo that are held up and slaved to her eyepiece by the previously mentioned Beta tech. Though she doesn’t get into robotics to the level Gina does she has developed the ultimate auto pilot in AI form that she can move from Vehicle to vehicle as needed when Kevin Koss isn’t around to transport her.</p><p>Like most Nerds she seems to have a need to read all about everything that interests her,.. making her (Like Gina) a pack-rat of information</p><p>. This comes in handy if you want to do out of the ordinary things like be a Radar officer on a fighter jet or be able to see a group of aircraft and determine which should be the best choice in a fight against all of them.</p><h2>Personal</h2><p>1. Friends - Penny Pincher prior to resolving her issues with Gina didn’t appear to have friends, only acquaintances, and employees. Her early life seemed to be a quiet and lonely one because she was that child prodigy. It made her a very arrogant person and too proud to stomach. After she teamed up with Gina that first time in El Dorado, she was forced to mingle and get to know more than a dozen people in life threatening situations that made her trust and depend on others. After that start, she seemed to open up and accept people as they were and fostered friendships with those willing to treat her as a person.</p><p>2. Romance – Also after that first team up with Gina, and before the second - she had met and gone out with Kevin “Ace” Koss, the pilot</p><figure style=\"width: 637px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1062743\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1062743-first_ride_with_kevin_koss.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.83516483516484\" data-width=\"637\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1062743-first_ride_with_kevin_koss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1062743\"><img alt=\"Kevins 1st trip with Penny\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55253/1062743-first_ride_with_kevin_koss.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1062743-first_ride_with_kevin_koss.jpg 637w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55253/1062743-first_ride_with_kevin_koss.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55253/1062743-first_ride_with_kevin_koss.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Kevins 1st trip with Penny</figcaption></figure><p>who normally transports Gina, her sister and their gear all over the world. What has occurred since then is a serious relationship between the two with Penny working toward getting married, and Kevin getting used to the idea while sidestepping her less than subtle attempts. In Kevin Koss she appears to have found someone who was not intimidated by her wealth or intelligence but who could see the person behind the arrogant elitist she played at for so long. She has now worn him down to the point where he rarely corrects her anymore when she calls him Kevin in public. They were  having issues that were caused in part with another woman who set her sights on Kevin, “Skippy” the Premier ace of the mercenary organization NightFlight. Skippy has more in common with Ace in regards to flying than Penny does, and believed this made her the better choice for him. Penny feared that she would lose Kevin to her and this is where the issue came from. The situation came to a head when Skippy had forced Ace to give his word to marry her by threatening to kill hostages of a failed attempt to take over Nightflights flying fortress the Gull Wing. Penny Pincher had then challenged Skippy to an Dog fight for Kevin Koss. Whomever lost would \"ditch\" Kevin and move on. Skippy accepted,.. and it would have been an easy win for her - except she had to break off to defend the Gull Wing, and it cost her her plane and the match against Penny, (Who got a free pass from night flight for assisting in the rescue of the Gull Wing.) Skippy is leaving Ace to Penny in the mixed belief that Penny does love Ace but she can just be patient that her dangerous lifestyle will end with her being killed leaving Ace to her. Currently as of this writing Penny and Kevin have married and are on a \"working\" honeymoon.</p><p>3. Caring – Penny Pincer has gone from a “me” person to a “we” person. She has used her fortune, Standing in the community, and scientific / medical knowledge on more than one occasion simply because it was the right thing to do. She has Adopted a bio-engineered Harpy as her child and is raising her. She has spent millions to design and build earths first starship to go help a friend who was 500 million light years away. She has operated on and saved more than one friend from certain death.</p><p>As of this writing Penny remains engaged in multiple projects both within her own interests and is supporting the Interests of her friends. She is deciphering the origins of a silicon life form that came to earth millennium ago, examining and mapping the powers and abilities of the Dynasty, has uncovered the first hint of the encroaching danger from the previous Universe, has trained Charlotte up into the scientific method, and remains a foil and double-check for Gina on topics only the two of them can have animated convo on.</p><figure style=\"width: 793px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1138478\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.31147540983607\" data-width=\"793\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:31.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1138478\"><img alt=\"Ace on Penny\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg 793w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ace on Penny\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg 793w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55253/1138478-aconpenny.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ace on Penny</figcaption></figure><p>Penny Has changed the most in the Gold Digger universe going from competitor and rival to best friend of Gina Diggers.</p>",

    "deck": "Brianna is a clone of Gina and Britanny (Cheetah) Diggers created when Gina tried to rid them both of a curse. Brianna shares aspects of both sisters as well as some unique to herself.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>On one of their earlier adventures, the Diggers sisters, <a href=\"/gina-diggers/4005-48412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48412\">Gina</a> and Britanny \"<a href=\"/cheetah/4005-48413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48413\">Cheetah</a>\" Diggers, fell under a curse that would get progressively worse until it killed them. To escape the curse, Gina put a copy of her and Cheetah's biological data into an inert mass of organic matter and sent the curse after it. The plan worked, mostly. While the curse no longer followed Gina and Cheetah, its energy brought the organic matter to life and made it evil. The being called itself Grave Digger and immediately sought them out to kill them. The sisters held her off until Dr. Diggers arrived and removed the curse while the being remained. Grave Digger became Brianna Digger and a member of the family.</p><p>Brianna was originally a straight combination of Gina (though not quite as smart) and Cheetah (though not quite as powerful), but has developed her own personality. She has a passion for high-tech weaponry, a thirst for danger and adventure as well as an innate propensity for magic not shared by her sisters (Cheetah eventually gaining artificial ability in that area). Physically speaking, while she is the combination of a werecheetah and a human, she lacks the werecheetah transformation ability. Instead, her normal 'human' form has most of the attributes of a werecheetah such as superhuman speed, strength, rapid healing, and improved senses at half the level of a transformed werecheetah. This is only visually apparent in her cat-like ears and the stripe she has over one ear.</p><p>Her greatest achievement in technology is the creation of the 'Peebo' series AIs, robots who's personality and learning capability surpasses that of any invented by her sister, and who even possess an aura, suggesting she instinctually pours her magic talents to aid in their creation. <a href=\"/peebri/4005-64530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64530\">Peebri</a>, <a href=\"/peegi/4005-64531/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64531\">Peegi</a>, and <a href=\"/peebrit/4005-64532/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64532\">Peebrit</a>, or the 'Peebo scouts,' are the smartest and lead Peebos in this series, used as assistants and modeled after her and her sisters. Brianna treats the advanced learning AIs much like daughters, which in a sense, they are.</p><p>After several years, she trained to harness her magical powers under her archmage father, often combining it with her skill in firearms when in combat for a variety of effects, whether using her powers to energy weaponry or enscribing magic glyphs with her carefully-aimed shots.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Origin</p><p>======</p><p>Maurglon many years starts out seeing Thor but as a kid he had no idea of whom he was but attacked the young hero anyway. Although <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" slug=\"thor\"> Thor</a> fought back to Maurglon surprise Thor ultimately defeated the foe leaving him unconscious. Later on Loki Thor’s half brother had found the foe unconscious and put a spell on him as he led Maurglon back to his cave and imprisoned the troll their for use later on in the future.  Years later Thor was being tried for attacking <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25894\" href=\"/tyr/4005-25894/\" slug=\"tyr\"> Tyr</a>.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\" href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" slug=\"loki\"> Loki</a> saw this was the perfect chance to let Maurglon free from the cavern was as a distraction to force Thor to leave the trial and have to fight him. Maurglon wasn’t at all happy to see Loki and hear his plans but he really wanted his revenge on Thor after being trapped their all those years Loki then teleported Maurglon to New York city where he started his rampage in hopes Thor would come to stop him. Thor was proven innocent and went to New York to Stop the foe with his foe with his fathers blessings.  While on his rampage two lovers on a fire escape lives were in danger. This gave Maurglon and advantage over Thor just slightly because Thor was focused on saving the two and Maurglon eventually got his chance and pummeled on Thor.  Thor eventually over came this pummeling by his determination for the bystanders and took Maurglon out. Loki then simply teleported Maurglon away.</p><p>Powers</p><p>======</p><p>Maurglon possessed class 40 strength and was invulnerable able to go toe to toe with young Thor but not as long with and older Thor. Being a troll he preferred a dark environment. He also had a tail if he ever wanted could be used as a whip.</p>",

    "deck": "The leader of the capsule gang,and best friend to Tetsuo.",
    "description": "<p>The main protagonist, he is brave and sometimes dim witted and regarded among his friends as flamboyant and highly egotistical, but he is always rebellious which makes the others in the gang look up to him. Leader and Founder of motor cycle gang from some vocational school. He befriended Tetsuo when they were young and they remained friends up until the events of Akira. On the night of Tetsuo's accident, Kaneda and the rest of the gang are taken in for questioning. While there, he meets Kei, whom is apparent that he is attracted to her but she and her group use him to get into the government building holding Tetsuo. He's unwillingly been thrown into the middle of a battle between the government and a resistance faction. Not interested in politics, but seemingly obsessed with playing the hero and winning the woman, Kaneda makes it his duty to keep Kei and Neo-Tokyo safe from the maniacal Tetsuo. Even though his goal is to bring Tetsuo down, he can't shake the fact that he was his best friend.</p><p>Kaneda's Bike</p><p>One of the most famous and iconic images in Akira is Kaneda's motorcycle, a sleek looking, sport motorcycle. Its recognizability is due, in part, to the placement of the bike on many of the different posters for the film. In the manga, the bike displays an old Honda logo. In the film, it displays a BMW logo. Unlike the bikes of the other members of The Capsules and The Clowns gangs, Kaneda's bike is a sport bike with a shell covering the inner components and a distinct red finish. Conversely, most of the other gang members' bikes are constructed in classic chopper style, placing the engine and other components open and visible.</p><p>When the movie was released, a full-scale reproduction of Kaneda's bike was made as a showpiece for advertisements. According to \"Akira Club,\" the bike's whereabouts \"became unknown\" after being sent to England for a publicity campaign.</p><p>Birthday: September 5, 2003</p><p>Age: 16</p><p>Blood type: Unknown</p><p>Height: 5'6</p><p>Weight: 116</p>",

    "deck": "A teenage boy in NeoTokyo who acquired vast telekinetic powers.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Tetsuo’s early years are unknown. Flashbacks reveal he may have been an orphan. We first know of him as a student in a school for delinquents in NeoTokyo, Japan. He was part of Kaneda's gang of trouble-making bikers.</p><p>One night while trying to catch up with his gang he nearly collided with an escaped government experiment, a young boy with the face of an old man. The boy through his use of psychokinesis was unharmed but Tetsuo was left injured in the accident. When the secret military arrived, they found only Tetsuo and abducted him presumably for security reasons.</p><p>While at the government research facility, Tetsuo underwent some very peculiar “tests”. The nature of these tests were unknown but later that night in his room, he began to have vivid surreal dreams and exhibit psychic power including feats of telekinesis.</p><p>Tetsuo gained his telekinetic ability from coming in contact with one of the other telekinetic human being.His powers alter greatly because of government test and having to fight others out of his mind which cause them to go out of countrol.</p><p>He eventually establishes himself as a ruler over the renegade society of teenagers in old Tokyo. He supplied his society with experimental “pills” that caused each person to manifest some sort of psychic ability.</p><p>He finally was defeated by his old friend Kaneda, the experimental children, and Akira.</p><h2>Significant Events</h2><p><strong>Cybernetic Arm:</strong></p><p>When Tetsuo's arm is disintegrated by the SOL laser, he reconstructs his arm via telekinesis from various metal parts he found.</p><p><strong>Psychometablic Amoeba:</strong></p><p>Tetsuo’s power grows significantly over time. His control however seems be unable to keep pace with his power. When he is emotionally charged or hurt, his body contorts and balloons out of control, psycho metabolically mutating into an amorphous fleshy blob.</p><p>While out of control, Tetsuo inadvertently kills his girlfriend, Kaori, crushed within his flesh.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Tetsuo is known for his disdain for authority higher than his own. Years of being “not good enough” has grown an inferiority complex within him where he is constantly trying to overcompensate with displays of rebellious behavior. He compulsively tries proving himself first to his biker gang peers then as he manifests psychic abilities to the rest of the established world.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p><strong>Psychokinesis</strong> – He has the ability to move matter and energy with his mind. While he hasn’t shown the ability to create psychokinetic explosions like Akira, he has been seen to rend metal objects of up at least 50 tons.</p><p><b>Teleportation</b> - Tetsuo teleports once during the movie when he finds out where to go to find Akira. He escapes from the facility he was being held in this way. In the manga however he is constantly seen teleporting.</p><p><strong>Flight</strong> – Psychokinetically propelling himself through the air he can fly at incredible speeds. He has been seen to fly up beyond the atmosphere to the level of Geo-synchronous orbit of satellites.</p><p><strong>Telepathy</strong> – He has been shown to be able to hear the thoughts of the experimental children (other psychics) for miles away.</p>",

Arthur Petrelli and Daniel Linderman were on a mission to locate an airplane. </p><p>They found they were too late and there were no survivors, but \"Dallas\" decided to carry on with the airplane's mission to destroy Au Co. They presumed that it was the nearby farming village, but later realized that it was a young girl with the ability to make plants grow at a rapid rate when her guardian shouted her name when Dallas started to destroy the village. She was shot to death by Petrelli despite Linderman's best efforts to stop him. </p><p>This event though later on became the starting point of Mr. Linderman's and Petrelli's friendship.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><h2>Creation</h2><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Genn met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48412\" href=\"/gina-diggers/4005-48412/\" slug=\"gina-diggers\">Gina</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48413\" href=\"/cheetah/4005-48413/\" slug=\"cheetah\">Britanny Diggers</a> when they broke into the tomb of the world's first ruler in Iran. Once inside the sisters separated to explore. Suddenly, as Britanny turned into a room she saw her boyfriend and prince of El Dorado, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48589\" href=\"/stripe/4005-48589/\" slug=\"stripe\">Stripe</a>. He had lost his innocent personality and was being quite passionate. Before things could get <i>very</i> interesting. He suddenly changed. He doesn't normally have glowing eyes and nasty looking fangs. Britanny quickly over powered her faux-boyfriend. Who then changed into herself. Still Britanny prevailed. Only then did this being calling itself a Rakshasa show it's natural form. We finally got to meet Genn. Having no specific gender it was appearing as a gender neutral being. Genn explained that he had been trapped in these ruins for eons. Afraid to try and escape due to the numerous traps. He knew to take on the role of her boyfriend by using his ESP. He wouldn't of really harmed her. The Rakshasa feast not of flesh and blood, but on ethereal forces that humans and demihumans posses. Without any targets for so long he had used a mystical fountain to keep himself alive, but always felt hungry. The attack was due to his own impatience and hunger. Once it was clear that Genn was no longer a threat. Britanny decided to trust him. Genn tried offering Britanny a more pleasureable way for him to feast on her ethereal energy, but she shot him down.</p><p>Britanny brought Genn along and introduced him to her sister Gina. Almost immediately Genn started flooding Gina with praise before Britanny bopped him in the head. Genn was able to lead Gina to the treasure room they had come for, but they had already learned from the device called the Historian that all the treasure had been removed around two thousand years ago. All that was left was a single brass armlet. Genn was safe, outside the treasure vault, as the Bad Luck curse waved over the Digger sisters for grabbing that left over armlet. The bad luck would start small, but would gradually increase until the both of them were dead.</p><p>The next morning Genn and Gina were working on a way to get out of this trap infected ruin. Genn's contribution was a map, pointing out all the corridors, rooms, and traps, drawn with magic over the floor. Britanny had noticed that one area of the map was lacking a sign of any real traps. Genn warned the sisters that area was guarded by a ferocious demon, that is five inches long. Ignoring his warnings the sisters decided to take that route anyways.</p><p>During the fight with the evil mouse demon Genn did his best to either stay out of the way of the Digger sisters' bad luck, or help by using levitation and telekinesis. When they were all able to finally escape the tomb they met up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48442\" href=\"/general-akbar/4005-48442/\" slug=\"general-akbar\">General Akbar's</a> forces. The Diggers girls were about to be captured, but Genn distracted the troops with the body of an extremely buxom woman. This action allowed Gina and Britanny the time they needed to escape. Once Gina learned that Genn could turn into a buff man. Genn had to get Britanny to pull her sister off of him.</p><h3>Birth of Grave Digger</h3><p>Once in the United States and the Diggers home. Gina asked Genn to join her in the hot tub, but he seemed hesitant. Britanny, curious about his lack of enthusiasm, asked why he was so aggressive with her though suddenly changed when it comes to Gina. Genn simply stated that for Britanny he could change into her boyfriend to make her happy. Using his ESP, Genn could see that Gina was looking for a <i>'marathon'</i>. After negociating Gina down to the idea of a 'Ten-K run'. Genn agreed, providing he could feast on her ethereal energy afterward. As Gina and Britanny engaged in some sisterly banter about who tends to walk in on who during private times. Genn inadvertently gave Gina an idea to trick the Bad Luck curse into leaving them.</p><p>This idea was what brought about the birth of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48591\" href=\"/brianna-diggers/4005-48591/\" slug=\"brianna-diggers\">Grave Digger</a>, a merged clone of Gina and Britanny. The plan was that by scanning their genetic structure into one of Gina machines. They could get the curse to no longer see them, and thus pass into the genetic copy that was made. The plan had worked, but the meer act of removing the curse let out such powerful energies that it knocked out everyone in the room. Once all were awake they met this being that shared both Gina and Britanny's appearance. She called both of them\"mother\", and promised that if they would both step back into the genetic tubes she could enhance both the them. The way she claims to have both of their strengths in one form, but Genn's ESP saw through her deception. This creature had no love in her heart. Only the urge to kill. Once she knew her plans were foiled she knocked Genn out, and proceeded to try and kill her mothers. She had no intention of killing Genn. Gina's libido within her still desired his masculine form.</p><p>Genn was unconscious, but not seriously harmed as Gina and Britanny fought with the being now calling herself Grave Digger. Once awake, Britanny was gone, and the fight was well over. Theodore Diggers, the girls' father, had arrived before anyone was seriously harmed and was able to remove the curse. Grave Digger was cured of her need to kill, and was adopted into the Diggers family with a new name. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48591\" href=\"/brianna-diggers/4005-48591/\" slug=\"brianna-diggers\">Brianna</a>. Genn found that her new friend Brianna was still <u>very</u> interested in getting to know him better.</p><h3>Life with the Diggers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/905411-golddigger_genn003.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-905411\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.64028776978417\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/905411-golddigger_genn003.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-905411\"><img alt=\"Genn - GD#101 cover\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/905411-golddigger_genn003.png\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47703/905411-golddigger_genn003.png 278w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-width=\"278\"></a><figcaption>Genn - GD#101 cover</figcaption></figure><p>Brianna quickly became Genn's best friend and primary source of ethereal energy, as friends 'with benefits.' In part this was because both had their eyes on other people who were at the time out of reach, and Genn helped Brianna get over her unrequited love of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30289\" href=\"/stripe/4005-30289/\" slug=\"stripe\">Stripe</a>, while Brianna helped encourage Genn in Genn's own relationship.</p><p>Genn expressed a romantic interest in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48846\" href=\"/seance/4005-48846/\" slug=\"seance\">Seance</a> and began spending more time in female form. After some courtship Genn and Seance went out on a date. At the end, Seance admitted that he still wanted Gina. Genn ran from the car crying where she saw <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64684\" href=\"/madrid/4005-64684/\" slug=\"madrid\">Madrid</a>. She promised Genn that if she helped her with her plan. Madrid promise Genn that she could have Seance for herself. Heartbroken, Genn reluctantly agreed, but quickly started having second thoughts. After Madrid was foiled in the end. Seance and Genn talked. He realized that Gina's only real love is her work, and he was blind to realize that there was someone always there caring for him. Genn and Seance embraced then kiss.</p><p>The next time Genn was seen was several years later. Still involved with Seance and now married, Genn had chosen to adopt a permanently female from, and the two were happily together. Though Genn's powers do occasionally create some embarrassment, as while Genn is permanently female, she still shape-shifts whenever she copies someone else's powers, resulting in a female version of the target. Seance finds it a bit weird to fight alongside his wife when she's in a female version of his body.</p><p>Britanny will refer to Genn as \"Little Buddy\" during their fishing trips. Genn won't tolerate it anywhere but on the boat.</p><p>Though no longer sharing a mutual romantic interest, Brianna is still Genn's best friend and the two are often partners in crime.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Natural Abilities</h3><p><b>Gender Shifting</b></p><p>Genn's species has no specific gender and can change between physical sexes at will. The form they take is up to the individual preferences of each being, and they can switch between sexes without much effort. Some of her kind choose to take on a gender neutral body, as Genn often did to conserve energy. Genn's three forms were of a highly muscled male, often used for physical tasks or defense in addition to dealing with female targets, a busty female, and a small neutral form. Genn voluntarily gave up the ability to change between sexes when she chose to stay with Seance.</p><p><b>Shape Shifting</b></p><p>Genn's species can also take on the form of other people and even animals such as birds and griffons, and she can mimic the powers and abilities of the person she impersonates. This still doesn't make up for the lack of training and skill that the natural owner has if using an unfamiliar form, but due to the variety of abilities it can grant, it serves as Genn's primary tool in a fight. The more ether Genn has, the more she can make use of this ability, and larger forms and greater changes consume more energy.</p><p><b>ESP</b></p><p>Genn's species can read the minds of others. Out of courtesy, she won't pick into the minds of her friends without good cause. In combination with her shape shifting powers. This does allow Genn to dig into thoughts to find people the target knows and take their form. This comes in handy for her kind so they can seduce a person and eventually feast on their ethereal force. This power could also be used to find and take on the form of a target's greatest opponent, learn of moves they're weak to (if they are thinking of it), or distract simple minded army to chase after a buxom beauty.</p><p><b>Ethereal Drain</b></p><p>The Rakshasa species, while able to eat solid food, feast most on the ethereal forces that are given off by all humans, werecats, and other living beings. The process can be quite ticklish and the target must remain still, otherwise the Rakshasa could loose their energy rather then gain more to feed on. To counter this the Rakshasa will either try to pleasure their targets sexually till they fall asleep, or petrify them in fear. Due to their large amounts of ether, mages are a preferred target.</p><h3>Magics</h3><p>Genn has the magical powers of any mage she turns into, most commonly those of her mate Seance, in addition to Genn's own innate shapeshifting, ESP, and draining abilities.</p><p><b>Map Making</b></p><p>Using simple magics, Genn can often times draw maps or other designs onto any surface. This came in handy for her first appearance in the tomb she had been trapped within. Since she knew where mos of the traps were. The map she drew assisted the Diggers sisters in the escape of all of them.</p>",

    "description": "<p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ryan Tabbot is both a former rival and boyfriend of Gina Diggers.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ryan possesses Photographic reflexes that allow him to duplicate the same moves of anyone he see's in action even once, resulting in his base fighting skills come from Kung Fu movies. He put these skills to good effect, becoming a professional treasure hunter. While not on the level of Gina or her rival Penny in terms of archeology skills, his physical abilities allowed him to traverse dangerous tombs and other locations easily. As the rivals began finding more dangerous location, Ryan and the Diggers sisters began to team up with increasing frequency, and Ryan and <a href=\"/cheetah/4005-48413/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48413\">Britanny Diggers</a> would often match up against less ethical rivals like Irwin 'Peewee' Talon and his team of enhanced bodyguards, <a href=\"/daishi/4005-9913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9913\">Daishi</a>, <a href=\"/zelda/4005-10407/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10407\">Zelda</a>, and <a href=\"/jason-ionis/4005-9911/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9911\">Ionis</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Additionally, Ryan's a professional mixed martial artist, practicing against some of the best fighters in the world on Team Jet, alongside fighters like <a href=\"/ayane-anno/4005-61837/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61837\">Ayane Anno</a> 'Mistress,' one of his long-time friends, and more recently Jade-realm fighters <a href=\"/gar/4005-8998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8998\">Gar Silvear</a>, <a href=\"/luan/4005-9696/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9696\">Luan</a>, and Carla, who he introduced to the fighting circuit.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Abilities and weaknesses</b></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While his photographic reflexes allow him to copy any moves he sees from a single glance, and he is an experienced warrior, other fighters may still surpass him in their knowledge of when best to use particularly risky moves or other skills such as reading foe's movements, Ryan is aware of this lack, having observed such powerful fighters as <a href=\"/julia-diggers/4005-48600/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48600\">Julia Diggers</a> and her senior students, leaving him seeking for a master that can take him to the next level.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Additionally, while it was harder than simply copying the motions, after seeing the ninja Daishi use chi on several occasions, Ryan was eventually able to reproduce the ability and can now throw concussive chi 'fireballs,' giving him a powerful ranged attack that he's developed with practice.</p>",

    "deck": "An outcast during her childhood, Kelly grew up rough and tough, feeling she could never confine in anyone and became a very distant person. Slowly she has been able to warm up to fellow Sentinel, Sin.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Footsteps</h2> <p>As a child Kelly was always an outcast because of her chalk-white skin, but worse then being an outcast was feeling abandoned by her father. To fill this pit, Kelly began experimenting with drugs, and when her mother discovered this, Kelly was thrown out of her house. Feeling abandoned again, Kelly went to New York where she fell in with a rough crowd. Her wild behavior eventually came with a wakeup call when a couple of her friends died. This lead to the discovery of her powers and her career as Harlette. Much like her father, Kelly went on to join the 2nd generation of Sentinels trying to discover the whereabouts of her father.</p><p>After the breakup of the Sentinels, Kelly continued to fight crime on a street level. On one of her patrols she was attacked by a horde of demons, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48515\" href=\"/electron/4005-48515/\" slug=\"electron\">Electron</a> showed up just in time to save her. This attacked sparked the team to regroup, but the reunion was cut short when the group was attacked and the base was blown up. Kelly had luckily been outside of the base. For a little bit Kelly believed her and Electron were the only survivors until the rest of the team burst from the ground. When they regrouped <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48616\" href=\"/gospel/4005-48616/\" slug=\"gospel\">Gospel</a> sent the team to a Hell dimension in hopes of receiving their help in defeating her father, Damien, who ruled over that dimension. Gospel used what little strength she had to get the team away from Damien who had them under his control for a moment. Kelly was the only one left behind to save Sin who Damien was planning on using as a gateway to Earth. Kelly did a surprise attack, but it barely phased Damien. Luckily Phazer showed up to save her and the rest of the Sentinels defeated him. With her dying words, Gospel sent the team back to Earth.</p> <p>Back home Kelly confronted <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48620\" href=\"/sin/4005-48620/\" slug=\"sin\">Sin</a>, because Gospel had said their destinies were entwined. The two ended up at Sin's home where Kelly talked about her rough years on the street hoping for her powers to come. The two of them regrouped with the rest of the Sentinels to return to the base in search of <a data-ref-id=\"4055-48517\" href=\"/cyprus/4055-48517/\" slug=\"cyprus\">Cyprus</a>. The team got ambushed by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48516\" href=\"/squadron-7/4060-48516/\" slug=\"squadron-7\">Squadron 7</a>, but they managed to make it out with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48621\" href=\"/splash/4005-48621/\" slug=\"splash\">Splash</a>'s help. The joyful moment was cut short when they were abducted. </p><p>On the alien spacecraft the females and the males were split. Kelly, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48615\" href=\"/firebomb/4005-48615/\" slug=\"firebomb\">Firebomb</a>, and Splash were all sent to a room where they could please the male aliens. Luckily Splash escaped, but Kelly and Firebomb were left. Kelly promised to protect Firebomb, but when a group of the aliens tried to rape her, she snapped and killed them all. The guys arrived only to witness her huddled in the middle of dead guards. Maurice managed to comfort her and when they managed to escape on an alien spacecraft, Kelly said she no longer wanted to reform or even be a hero.</p>",

As a child Maurice wasn't relieved of his curse like his sister. When Savannah disappeared she made sure Maurice and Michelle were well taken care of at the monastery. As a child Maurice was physically fit, but struggled to control his raging power. He was also worried with what might happen if Damien ever returned. When the Sentinels began to form, Maurice was eager to join knowing, if anything would happen to him, his sister would have people to help her.</p><p>The Sentinels disbanded after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48651\" href=\"/switchfast/4005-48651/\" slug=\"switchfast\">Switchfast</a>'s, but a some time later they regrouped. At this reunion a horde of demons attacked and kidnapped Sin. He was taken to his father's realm where his father hoped to use him, along with 7 virgins, to crossover into Earth's plane. The ceremony began, but the Sentinels showed up to save him. Eventually, Maurice was able to break control and he released his anger onto his father. For a second he believed that he killed him until he got back up and started to do the final actions necessary to crossover. Gospel, in a last ditch effort, took Maurice's curse upon herself and was able to defeat Damien at the cost of her life. Before she died she was able to teleport the Sentinels home.</p> <p>Back on Earth, Maurice began to spend some quality time with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48617\" href=\"/harlette/4005-48617/\" slug=\"harlette\">Harlette</a> who was told they have a connection to one another. The two returned to Maurice's apartment where he went for a change in his look. He shaved his head and brought out a new suit that was a bit more angelic. Maurice, along with the rest of the Sentinels, returned to the scene of their former base which was destroyed in the demon horde attack where Sin was kidnapped. When they arrived they were ambushed by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48516\" href=\"/squadron-7/4060-48516/\" slug=\"squadron-7\">Squadron 7</a> and Maurice fought <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48677\" href=\"/adlivon/4005-48677/\" slug=\"adlivon\">Adlivon</a>, who he believes he had a connection to. The team managed to beat the Squadron, but before they could relax they were abducted by aliens. </p><p>On the alien spaceship the males and females of the team were separated. The guys were sent to a prison area that they managed to escape from. When they finally found the girls it was not a comfortable moment. Harlette was in the middle of the room with several dead guards lying around her. Maurice tried his best to comfort her. The team managed to escape and Maurice tried to remain optimistic, but the damage was done and the team disbanded again.</p>",
