    "description": "<h2><span>Origin</span></h2><p>A mischievous anthropomorphic bear boy, Bobby Bruin was a member of the Bruin Boys, created by artist Julius Stafford Baker. He first appeared in the Daily Mirror newspaper's comics section in April 1904. In November 1904 the group began appearing in The Monthly Playbox, a colour supplement in The World and his Wife magazine, and from 1909 until at least 1942 they also appeared in Playbox Annual.</p><h2><span>Character Evolution</span></h2><p>Initially Bobby and his friends attended Mrs. Hippo's kindergarten, but in 1914 <a data-ref-id=\"4010-2804\" href=\"/amalgamated-press/4010-2804/\" slug=\"amalgamated-press\">Amalgamated Press</a> launched <a data-ref-id=\"4050-51047\" href=\"/rainbow/4050-51047/\" slug=\"rainbow\">The Rainbow</a>, a comic aimed at young children, and Baker's naughty animals relocated to the new comic's front page, as well as taking up residence in Mrs. Bruin's Boarding School, run by Bobby's mother, from which they subsequently derived their joint name, the Bruin Boys. From 1919, while continuing to appear in Rainbow, they also starred in the newly launched Tiger Tim's Tales, later renamed Tiger Tim's Weekly. Additionally, they also appeared in Tiger Tim Annual (from 1922 through to 1954) and Bruin Boys Annual (from 1929 through to 1940), with Tiger Tim rapidly outstripping the other Bruin Boys in terms of popularity. Tiger Tim Weekly ended in 1940, but the group continued to star in Rainbow until its cancellation in 1956, then transferred to Tiny Tots between 1956 and 1959, Playhour from 1959 to 1965, and Jack and Jill from 1965 to 1985.</p><p>Bobby's twin sister is Betty Bruin of the Hippo Girls.</p>",

    "description": "<h2><span>Origin</span></h2><p>A mischievous anthropomorphic ostrich boy, Willie Ostrich was a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59299\" href=\"/bruin-boys/4060-59299/\" slug=\"bruin-boys\">Bruin Boys</a>, created by artist Julius Stafford Baker. He first appeared in the Daily Mirror newspaper's comics section in April 1904. In November 1904 the group began appearing in The Monthly Playbox, a colour supplement in The World and his Wife magazine, and from 1909 until at least 1942 they also appeared in Playbox Annual.</p><h2><span>Character Evolution</span></h2><p>Initially Willie and his friends attended Mrs. Hippo's kindergarten, but in 1914 <a data-ref-id=\"4010-2804\" href=\"/amalgamated-press/4010-2804/\" slug=\"amalgamated-press\">Amalgamated Press</a> launched <a data-ref-id=\"4050-51047\" href=\"/rainbow/4050-51047/\" slug=\"rainbow\">The Rainbow</a>, a comic aimed at young children, and Baker's naughty animals relocated to the new comic's front page, as well as taking up residence in Mrs. Bruin's Boarding School, from which they subsequently derived their joint name, the Bruin Boys. From 1919, while continuing to appear in Rainbow, they also starred in the newly launched Tiger Tim's Tales, later renamed Tiger Tim's Weekly. Additionally, they also appeared in Tiger Tim Annual (from 1922 through to 1954) and Bruin Boys Annual (from 1929 through to 1940), with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-84998\" href=\"/tiger-tim/4005-84998/\" slug=\"tiger-tim\">Tiger Tim</a> rapidly outstripping the other Bruin Boys in terms of popularity. Tiger Tim Weekly ended in 1940, but the group continued to star in Rainbow until its cancellation in 1956, then transferred to Tiny Tots between 1956 and 1959, Playhour from 1959 to 1965, and Jack and Jill from 1965 to 1985.</p><p>Willie's twin sister is Olive Ostrich of the Hippo Girls.</p>",

He quickly revealed himself to be a power hungry opportunist who merely saw Mary's potential achievement using <a href=\"/dream-probe/4055-55907/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55907\">Neurotech</a> in curing the young certifiable as a means of garnering wealth and power for himself and his wealthy political associates. He would even go so far as Firing <a href=\"/leonard-price/4005-53367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53367\">Dr. Leonard Price</a> who was adamantly against subjecting Fairchild to the procedure, so much so that he caused a physical disruption leading to an attempt on the patients life and William had him locked up at the Institute as an inmate. When the project failed however he was furious, yelling at Mary over the phone to cover it up ordering her over to the congratulations party he had already arranged with his influential entourage who backed her project.</p><p>Under pressure by his associates for Mary Young not attending her own celebration, they all come under attack by a <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-dead-onez/4060-62730/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-62730\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dead One</a> who ends up killing and reanimating one of their number.

As more afflicted by the psycho plague turn up at the Young family abode, snapping back at Judy who berates him publicly, another of his business partners demands an explanation as his career is on the line due to Stone and Mary's blunder with this plague of lunatics. When the power goes out William opts he and his delegates use Mary's family as lures to distract the affected plague spreaders while they make a getaway. Much to the ire of Rick and his, who overhears his cowardly ploy, the former throwing him to the ground while the younger siblings berate him for his weaseling nature. As Ernie and a reanimated biker gang attacks the house Commissioner Stone tries to cut his losses and run leaving everyone else behind, when the smoke clears Mr. Stone creeps out of the damaged house finding the now truly deceased Ernie's <a href=\"/the-badge-of-evil/4055-55642/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55642\">leftover keepsake</a> pricking his finger on it. </p>",

After a few minutes of dancing, Harmony gives Violet some <a data-ref-id=\"4015-56039\" href=\"/drug-use-in-comics/4015-56039/\">narcotics</a> so that she will loosen up on the dance floor. With her senses already partially disturbed, Harmony kisses her, which Violet originally takes to have been an erotic advance, but then realizes that Harmony had a sample of the drug called the Dream in her tongue which Violet has also now consumed. At their apartment, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58999\" href=\"/calie-liddle/4005-58999/\">Calie</a> is coming out of being drugged the previous night. She dreamed that she was in the middle of a normal family moment where Brandon, Violet and herself were involved in a family portrait. She starts to realize that things are going wrong as both Brandon and Violet in her dreams become <a data-ref-id=\"4015-56065\" href=\"/suicide/4015-56065/\">suicidal</a>. Brandon tells her that she has to wake up to go help Violet. When she wakes up she finds her daughter missing. She goes to Harmony's apartment and finds her mother passed out from the same spiked drugs which she consumed. She searches Harmony's room and finds a flyer for Club Excess and then goes to find Violet. Meanwhile at the Club, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59301\" href=\"/the-flowers/4060-59301/\">Flowers</a> led by Red Rose have identified Violet and promise to corrupt her, even while the remaining attendees of the night club start to cannibalize one another. Calie arrives in time to intervene.

She found that people around her were dying and she sought some means of stopping this death. She eventually found out that it was her betrothed who was jealous of the others that shared her love. She sought revenge and in so doing made a deal with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80427\" href=\"/baba-yaga/4005-80427/\">Baba Yaga</a>, who traded the blood of innocents for increased power. Little did she know that the trade of power would send her to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-44649\" href=\"/wonderland/4020-44649/\">Wonderland</a> where she would become the Red Rose.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Red Rose is a mixture between the characters Elizabeth Bathory from Dracula stories and the Flowers from Alice in Wonderland.

So, one night, as the circus transferred between venues, the naively innocent Kid Kong broke out, and went looking for more bananas (or 'nanas, as he called them). Breaking into an apartment store, he took a liking to some oversized school uniforms therein and squeezed himself into a blazer and cap, then wandered the town, convinced he now looked just like a regular kid. When he took a break to beat his chest in joy, the resulting booming pounding drew the attention of nearby home owner Granny Smith, an intensely near-sighted, half-deaf old lady who had been very lonely since her son left home to go to sea. Mistaking the pounding noise for a gentle knocking at the door, and the enormous gorilla for a wandering school boy shaking with cold, she invited him in and, after he somehow squeezed through her front door, offered him some food. The police and circus owner soon arrived at Granny's house, storming in announcing their intention to recapture the ape, but an angry Granny drove them off, thinking they were simply being rude about her visitor and believing he had run away from a cruel home. Kong took an understandable shine to Granny, who in turn vowed to bring him up properly.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Mummy's Boy (his real name was never given) was a youth, apparently in his early teens, whose overprotective mother literally babied him, forcing him to wear a bonnet and infant's clothing, pushing him around in a pram, and refusing to let him do anything his peers did, consistently deeming whatever toys they had or activities they were doing to be far too dangerous for her child. Desperate to be treated like his peers and have fun, each week Mummy's Boy would enact elaborate schemes to escapes Mummy's clutches for a little while, but said plans almost inevitably resulted in him being injured, thus reinforcing Mummy's paranoia.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Mummy's Boy was created for Monster Fun #1, 14th June 1975, by Norman Mansbridge.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Mummy's Boy appeared throughout the entire run of Monster Fun, in one of the few strips not to feature a literal monster. He survived Monster Fun's cancellation and merger with <a data-ref-id=\"4050-37553\" href=\"/buster/4050-37553/\" slug=\"buster\">Buster</a>, where he enjoyed a long run, still never escaping his mother's clutches. Finally, with an impending merger with Nipper forcing Buster to drop existing strips to make space for incoming ones, Mummy's Boy finally had his last adventure in the 12th September 1987 issue, after a run of over twelve years.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>First appearance</h2><p>He first appears in Batman 12, where he's shown to be the younger sibling of Harper Row. This takes place before Batman 1's event hosted by Bruce Wayne. Cullen urges Harper to go out and have a good time, insisting that she worries too much. It's revealed that he's harassed by a gang for being gay when Harper spots a cut on his arm. But Cullen insists she goes. When she comes back, she finds their house ransacked and Cullen beaten up, the word \"fag\" cut into his hair. Harper matches this with her hair and supports him at school. That night, the group of thugs attack, and Batman saves them. This sparks Harper's obsession with Batman, and giving him a hand.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>A Great White Shark living in the oceans around Australia, Gums secretly had false teeth. With his false teeth in place, Gums remained a force to be reckoned with, and could munch his way through almost anything, but without them he was, literally, toothless. When he tried to attack a surfer, <a href=\"/bluey/4005-85038/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85038\">Bluey</a>, the dentures were knocked out, exposing his weakness, and Bluey stole them. Since new false teeth are hard to come by for a shark, he and Bluey began a long-running feud, with Gums seeking to retrieve his teeth and devour his foe while Bluey sought to deprive the shark of his dentures permanently, and thus render Gums harmless.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Gums was created by Robert Nixon and debuted in <a href=\"/monster-fun/4050-47712/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-47712\">Monster Fun</a> #35, 7th February 1976. He was clearly inspired by Jaws, the shark from Stephen Spielberg's movie.</p><h2>Character Development</h2><p>Immediately taking Monster Fun's cover spot, Gums proved a popular and enduring strip, with the hapless but villainous shark and Bluey engaged in a never-ending contest, with each one winning partial victories in turn: Gums would try but fail to eat the young boy, giving the lad the opportunity to steal Gums' teeth during the attempt, then Bluey would do his level best to keep the teeth out of Gums' reach, only for the cunning predator to find a way to retrieve them, and begin the cycle anew. Gums made the transition to <a href=\"/buster/4050-37553/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37553\">Buster</a> when it merged with Monster Fun, and continued to appear there until the 12th May 1984 issue.</p>",

    "description": "<p>At the end of the Beyond Wonderland series, the Cheshire Cat is killed by Calie, however as with most creatures from Wonderland it does not really stay dead.  Instead it takes the form of a regular cat which is left at the pound.  Lina is an exchange student that doesn't fit into school very well, between her promiscuous roommate, her roommate's racist boyfriend and the various other girls that pick on her.  Lina decides to adopt a cat to ease her loneliness and inadvertently chooses the depowered Cheshire Cat.  The Cheshire Cat eventually returns to full power and starts dispensing what it views as a healthy revenge against Lina's enemies (which comes down to killing them all.)  Lina is horrified at what he has done, but he threatens her too into becoming his companion.  Later she is shown in Wonderland as Calie has made her way back there to search for her daughter Violet.  She and the cat seem inseparable by that point.   </p>",

They seemed blissfully unconcerned as she proceeded to try and feed off of everyone in the neighborhood, perhaps because bad luck ensured she proved singularly unsuccessful in doing so.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Draculass was created by artist Terry Bave and first appeared in Monster Fun #1, 14th June 1975.</p><h2>Character Development</h2><p>Draculass continued her adventures through the entire run of Monster Fun, and survived her original title's merger with <a data-ref-id=\"4050-37553\" href=\"/buster/4050-37553/\" slug=\"buster\">Buster</a>, though she only lasted in her new home for a little over a year, her strip coming to an end with the 10th December 1977 issue. During her run she occasionally targeted characters from other strips in the comic, but never succeeded in feeding off them.</p>",

However, when his planet's sun seemed to die, drastic messuares where taken. He went looking for a way to inspark their sun once more, so his people could live. He found a possible solution in the form of earthling superhero, Jack of Hearts, whom had a connection to the planet because of his mother, whom was born there. Together with a band of his soldiers, Varga simply attacked Jack and wanted to saccrifice him, not knowing that Jack had already made a decision to help the Contraxian. When Commander Varga found out that his men where simply after seaking power and he witnessed his second in command killing the leaders of the planet, Varga had a change of mind. He however remained silent, and Jack of Heart was sent into the sun with a spaceship to inspark the sun. It all came to a heat when Varga found out that not only Jack of Heart, but also Jack's lover, a true Contraxian, was onboard the ship. He went after the ship and saccrificed his own life for that of Jack's lover, whom he saved. He had died an honorable man.",

Thus when the holidaying Short family inadvertently let some magic beans be buried under their caravan, were sent skyward atop the resulting beanstalk, and literally rolled into his house once the stalk finishing growing, Grizzly looked forward a quick snack. The Shorts felt otherwise, and so began a contest of wits between humans and giant.</p>",

That was until Romulus <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\" href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\">  Sabretooth</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\">  Wolverine</a>, and herself broke into the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50418\" href=\"/weapon-x/4060-50418/\">  Weapon X</a> facility and Wolverine volenteered for the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\" href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\">  Adamantium</a> bonding process. She told her brother to stop or she'd walk away from everything they had done. He wouldn't stop so she left. Romulus then had <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9392\" href=\"/professor-thorton/4005-9392/\">  Professor Thorton</a> erase Wolverine's memories particularly the ones that involved Remus.</p><h2>Character Creation</h2><p>Remus was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40472\" href=\"/jeph-loeb/4040-40472/\">  Jeph Loeb</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42064\" href=\"/simone-bianchi/4040-42064/\"> Simone Bianchi</a> and first appeared in  <a href=\"/\">  Wolverine #310</a>.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>Sabretooth Reborn</h3><p>Remus first appears during the battle between Romulus and Wolverine, and stabs Romulus with her sword from behind. She cautions Wolverine that her attack won't keep him down for long, and further warns him as he's about to pass out that he'd need to 'heal up.' Then in an interesting twist, she goes to kiss Wolverine as he passes out and also whispers something that's incomprehensible to the reader in his ear.</p><p>Remus later appears once again to aid Wolverine in the fight against the Sabretooth clones, remarking that he 'looks like hell.' Further flirting with him, she passes him one of her swords which Logan then uses to blow the facility up. As the two are escaping from the exploding building, Remus remarks that their ride is here and runs over to a descending helicopter. The two quickly board as the entire Weapon X complex is engulfed in fire.</p><p>Wolverine soon after remembers where else he heard her unusual accent before, and demands to know who she is. Remus reluctantly complies and imparts to Logan that she is Remus, the twin sister of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-34477\" href=\"/romulus/4005-34477/\">  Romulus</a>. She then asks Wolverine a favor, and that is for him to kill her twin.</p><p>Wolverine doesn't believe what she is saying and throws them both out a helicopter but when they land wolverine notices Remus has the same healing factor. She then convinces Wolverine that Romulus is a threat that he will need her help to stop.</p><p>The two then find <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\" href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\">  Cloak</a> and use his teleport powers to sneak in to Romulus's fortress in Italy. There Remus stays with Cloak and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1935\" href=\"/dagger/4005-1935/\">  Dagger</a> while Wolverine runs off to face Sabertooth. Once Romulus gets in the fight that is when Remus show up and fights her brother. Sabertooth, realizing he is loosing goes to plan B, a bomb. Cloak teleports Remus and Dagger out of harms way.</p><p>Later, Remus is seen with Wolverine on a beach some where warm, the two are now in love. And Wolverine remembers the day he got his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\" href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\">  Adamantium</a> and how Remus was there trying to talk Romulus out of it.</p>",

He is also cheating on her with <a href=\"/debbie/4005-30335/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30335\">Debbie the Duck</a> and multiple other women over the course of the series. Her children are Laurie and Bobby.  She is thirty-one, and Ken is twenty-five.</p><p>Barb wants a serious relationship and brings up the idea of marriage, but Ken is completely fear-struck at the idea of dealing with the responsibility of kids.  In fact, he doesn't seem to like kids at all.  However, they continue to see each other.  She tends to be somewhat self-conscious about their age difference and realizes he is constantly checking out other women (the baby sitter, the hostess at a restaurant, etc.)  She ends up dating other men as a result of Ken's inability to commit.  Ken tends to think of her as his main girlfriend, but clearly doesn't bond with her as deeply as he does with Duck or his friend <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/myron-feldman/4005-27985/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27985\">Myron</a>, since he tells them about his super powers and doesn't tell Barb.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Barb was created by <a href=\"/jim-shooter/4040-40450/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40450\">Jim Shooter</a> and <a href=\"/john-romita-jr/4040-13709/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-13709\">John Romita Jr.</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/star-brand/4050-3652/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3652\">Star Brand</a> #1.</p><h2>Character History</h2><p>Soon after Ken gets the power of the Star Brand, one of his enemies, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/old-man/4005-30334/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30334\">Old Man</a>, shows up at Barb's house.  Ken sees him and runs upstairs, where Laurie, her daughter, points a laser gun at him.  The Old Man hypnotized her, and while she wakes up at the moment, she continues to have psychological problems for months afterwards.</p><p>The fact that he won't tell her about his powers begins to affect their relationship; she can tell something is wrong.  They go on dates, and she tries to seduce him, but he runs out on Star Brand business, leaving her alone in her underwear.</p><p>She goes over to his place to talk to him later.  She sees a picture of Debbie in her underwear, but still somehow can't break up with him, even showing up to his birthday party later.  Amazingly, Ken comes to the realization that he needs to marry her while having an affair with a total stranger, and proposes to Barb.  She says yes.  He tries to break it off with Debbie, but she's so despondent that he decides to continue to see her for a while anyway, despite now being engaged to Barb.  Then he sees Barb again, and is finally about to tell her about his powers, when he sees her dealing with the everyday difficulties of being a parent (especially the parent of a girl who was hypnotized by a bad guy).  He ends up not telling her anything.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3091522\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/3091522-scan+32.jpeg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.81\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/3091522-scan+32.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3091522\"><img alt=\"Finally, she breaks up with him.\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/3091522-scan+32.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/3091522-scan+32.jpeg 500w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104794/3091522-scan+32.jpeg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/104794/3091522-scan+32.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Finally, she breaks up with him.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally the Old Man comes back and hypnotizes Duck.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Model Joanie Jordan was living in Los Angeles with her black cat Ebony, loving the money her job provided but longing for something more. When her modeling agency scheduled Joanie for a photo shoot for a large bank, the potential security breach attracted the attention of a group of criminals working for the Flesh Crawler. Their plan was to kidnap Joanie in her home, force her to introduce them as her assistants at the bank's photo session, then kill everyone inside and rob the bank.</p><p>Several armed men broke into her apartment, and overhearing the 'kill everyone' part of the plan, Joanie tried to fight off the criminals in her apartment. She was losing the fight when a lightning strike from a severe thunderstorm cut electricity and killed the lights. Joanie ran to her window to escape only to be struck by a green lightning bolt. Her cat Ebony ran to Joanie and the green electricity sparked from Joanie to her cat. The strange energy instantly linked Joanie to Ebony and gave her cat-like superpowers, and she used her new powers (and nine-inch retractable talons) to dispatch the criminals in her apartment.</p><p>Joanie was excited by her new cat-abilities, and she quickly created a costume and an identity for herself. As Catwoman, she leaped across the rooftops of LA for fun, and found herself using her powers to save several people during a major fire. Catwoman also kept clashing with the Flesh Crawler and his men until she defeated them all and left the Flesh Crawler for the police to arrest. Later, her attempts to stop an evil cult would result with her joining the Justice League of her universe.</p><p>Joanie hoped to share her secret with her father, a retired police detective who had always wished that his daughter had been a police officer rather than a model. However, her father was quite angry toward Catwoman, deeming her a dangerous vigilante, and Joanie decided to keep her identity and powers a secret.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>As Catwoman, Joanie has superhuman agility, enhanced speed, and night-vision. She can sprout nine-inch long claws from her fingernails that can cut through concrete easily and allows her attack enemies or scale walls. She shares an empathic link with her cat Ebony</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Introduced as a young woman of college age, Julie is unaware of much deeper secrets in her past. One of her ancestors was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10641\" href=\"/hp-lovecraft/4005-10641/\">H.P. Lovecraft</a> (the author) and her story includes a fictionalized account of his life. He witnesses at one point people being sacrificed to Wonderland so that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6749\" href=\"/charles-dodgson/4005-6749/\">Charles Dodgson</a> can maintain his youth, but Dodgson instead of killing him take him into his protection. This connection to Wonderland is said to be the source of Lovecraft's particular brand of writing. He reveals to Dodgson that he has secretly created a family of his own, and will not tell Charles who they are for fear that they might might manipulated. These offspring are said to have the power of being this realm's guardians in the battle against the madness of Wonderland. All of these events later become known to Julie as she is the Queen of Spades gives her a journal which was written by Lovecraft.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Her first appearance was in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-49367\" href=\"/grimm-fairy-tales-presents-call-of-wonderland/4050-49367/\">Grimm Fairy Tales Presents: Call of Wonderland</a> #1.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Though it is only early on in her comic book appearances, she has already demonstrated the change away from being a passive character in the events that surround her to one of being more proactive.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>She is originally introduced as a character entering a library late in the evening on the weekend. She is sexually harassed by some nearby male students. Once inside she encounters the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-85071\" href=\"/queen-of-spades/4005-85071/\">Queen of Spades</a>, who gives her a journal written by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10641\" href=\"/hp-lovecraft/4005-10641/\">H.P. Lovecraft</a>. In reading it she becomes aware that the story is more than fiction and aspect of it are true. She is attacked by an unknown monster in the library but manages to escape. Outside she faces once again the same male students, but resorts to some quick physical violence to deal with them. She later finds a business card for a tattoo parlor and goes to investigate, all the while discovering how Lovecraft's journal ties into the realm of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-44649\" href=\"/wonderland/4020-44649/\">Wonderland</a>. After arriving to the Tattoo Parlor she discovers its owner and operator <a data-ref-id=\"4005-85090\" href=\"/salome-gray/4005-85090/\">Salome Gray</a> battling a monster the likeness of which she tattooed on a client's back. The two escape together and try to find some answers. After escaping they journey together to an abandoned house where they discover a pathway to Wonderland. When they arrive there they discover the Red Knight who is keen on destroying them. Salome engages the knight while Julie battles a nearby sea monster. In the process they discover that Julie has the power of words in Wonderland while Salome has the power of drawing. They vanquish their foes and return to Earth, but they are drawn back into Wonderland by the power of the Queen of Spades, who needs them to fill the role of the Queen of Hearts in Wonderland.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As of yet she has not exhibited any special powers. All of her studies have left her with a keen intellect. Like other characters that visit Wonderland she can exert control over things there through her own willpower.</p><p>It is implied in other series that the land of Wonderland is similar to that of Myst. If that is the case then Julie is likely correspondingly a Wonderland version of a falseblood.</p><p>It is unknown if her assumption of the role as the Queen of Hearts has given her any increased power.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mr Mendoza was poor farmer living in the Peruvian Andes. After his beloved wife gave birth to their daughter Maria, they drove back from the hospital in the valley to their home. But before reaching home they were stopped by highway robbers. They had no money to give to the men, and in the ensuing scuffle Maria's mother was shot and killed. When the police arrived, they asked for money too, and ended up stealing the truck. Mr. Mendoza later saw them splitting the profits from his truck with the robbers. He resolved never to be a victim again, and that like the police he would have money through whatever means were necessary. In time, he became magistrate in a small village with a shady past and many dark secrets.</p><p>Maria Mendoza grew up to become a beautiful idealist, remembering the days of the great empires and often protesting the pillage of the Peruvian wealth, both natural and archeological. She was particularly angered by the illegal digs being conducted at the nearby ruins of the quasi-mythical city of Cuzco by the men of the rich, influential crimelord Armando Guitez.</p><p>Guitez's excavations had an even more sinister goal than selling off Peruvian history on the black market. There were mystical secrets hidden in the ruins and according to tradition, the Incan sun god Manco Capac had buried great evils under the city to imprison them. Guitez hoped to find magical powers in the ruins</p><p>Guitez's quest for mystical power was making him aggressive and irritable, even by crime lord standards. After having a man killed in court in front of the Mr Mendoza for speaking ill of him, he had the police force take Mr Mendoza to his house to discipline him.</p><p>Maria followed Guitez. An American named Steve Trevor was in love with her and agreed to help her despite the obvious danger and the fact that he was working for Guitez Industries.</p><p>Things quickly got out of hands at the Guitez estate. Guitez shot the juez dead, then sent his enforcers after Maria. Trevor helped her hide in the ruins, then started playing a risky game. He pretended to be a model Guitez employee, while actually shipping magical artifacts to L.A. so the crime lord wouldn't get them. Guitez knew what was going on, however, and shot Trevor, shattering a mystical rune Trevor was holding in the process.</p><p>A supernatural being emerged from the broken sigil, but Guitez wrestled with it physically and spiritually. He won and took the form and power of the monster. When a dragon also emerged from the ruins, he defeated it and added its power to his own. The empowered Guitez then left for L.A. to acquire the powers of the other runes Trevor had shipped there.</p><p>Meanwhile, Maria was drawn to a light in the mystical ruins and found the staff of Manco Capac, which destroyed the remaining cursed ruins and turned her into Wonder Woman. With his dying words, Trevor warned her about Guitez - and Wonder Woman flew to L.A. to stop him. Wonder Woman eventually impaled the demonic Guitez on a spike on the top of a Church of Eternal Empowerment temple before summoning lightning to incinerate him.</p><p>Adapting to her new surrounding with her trademark courage and resourcefulness, Maria quickly became the new secretary and junior reporter at L.A.'s tabloid the <i>National Exposer</i> . Her exceptional beauty made it rather easy to be hired by editor William Willard.</p><p>Like other heroes, Wonder Woman soon joined the Justice League of America to fight a dangerous cult</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>As Wonder Woman, Maria possesses a staff made of pure light that grants her the powers of an Incan sun god. Her staff changes Maria into an armored warrior with superhuman strength and the power to fly, The staff also allows her to fire blasts of light, and use ancient sorcery. The staff can also change into other weapons</p>",

    "description": "<p>Professor Len Lewis was an archaeologist who believed that the mythical Tree of Life (<a href=\"/yggdrasil/4020-55875/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55875\">Yggdrasil</a>) was not just a Norse myth but was in fact real. After extensive studies, Len tracked its location to a swamp in Africa. However before he could release his findings, his assistant shot and killed him, and took a sample of Yggdrasil's branches (which he planned to sell to the highest bidder).</p><p>However, energy flowed from the legendary tree into Len and brought him back to life. Yggdrasil had infused Len with its raw elemental powers and made him \"a Lantern to light the darkness\". Now calling himself the Green Lantern, Len was a living being of green energy and linked to the forces of nature. Using his elemental powers he fought monsters and the cult formed by the evil <a href=\"/reverend-dominic-darrk/4005-87903/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87903\">Reverend Dominic Darrk</a>. Later he gathered the world's greatest heroes to form the Justice League for his reality.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>As Green Lantern, Len uses the energy of the tree Yggdrasil to manipulate the forces of nature. His green energy can be used to create whirlwinds, ignite fires, cause earthquakes, generate tidal waves, and influence plants and animals. He can focus his green energy into explosive blasts, or channel it into others to heal them. Green Lantern can also fly at high speeds. When Len uses his powers, his skin glows green and the rune of Yggdrasil (which looks like a lantern) burns brightly on his chest.</p>",

His first appearance was in <a href=\"/just-imagine-stan-lee-with-scott-mcdaniel-creating/4000-175679/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-175679\">Just Imagine Stan Lee With Scott McDaniel Creating Aquaman #1</a>.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Just Imagine</h3><p>Marine biologist Ramon Raymond was intrigued by the thought of exploring the ocean's depth's without being encumbered by scuba gear. He injected himself with the DNA of a bottlenosed dolphin in hopes that he would develop the dolphin's underwater capabilities. However on his first test of his DNA injections in the open ocean, he was attacked by a bull shark. In a panic he swam away through a glowing green cloud of liquid as he saw the shark was avoiding it. But the green water, combined with the dolphin DNA, transformed him into living water. At first he was horrified but then found that he could change from water form back into his human persona.</p><p>He found that he could shift into his water form, which he dubbed Aquaman, at will. In his Aquaman form he could fire fire water jets, and surf on waves of his own creation. He decided to use his powers as a superhero, and protect the land and the sea from criminals</p><p>As a superhero he teamed up with other members of Earth-6 in the fight against evil.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>As Aquaman, Ramon is composed of living water and can fire water jets of varying intensities from his fingertips. He can form waves under his feet and surf on dry land. He can survive indefinitely underwater, and can swim at incredible speeds by using water propulsion. Despite the fact that he if made of water, Aquaman cannot squeeze through vents or grates as his water cohesion makes him almost solid. Despite some minor weaknesses, he has been described as one of the most powerful beings of this earth.</p><h3>Superhuman Speed</h3><p>Ramon As Aquaman has shown he can move at superhuman speeds both underwater and on land. He can keep up with a speeding car and is faster than a shark underwater. He can also leap at great heights (using water propulsion) and is extremely agile (being able to bounce around from moving car to moving car during a car chase).</p><h3>Underwater Adaptation</h3><p>He can function normally underwater and is able to withstand the high pressures and extreme temperatures of the deep due to his transformation to sentient water.</p><h3>Water Control</h3><p>Ramon has shown the ability to control water (both from his own body or any other source). He can shoot water jets from his hand that can cut through metal, leap through the air at great heights (using propulsion), surf on land fast enough to catch a speeding car and is completely immune to physical damage (such as bullets) since he can change from solid to liquid at will. His water control was powerful enough to brake up fight between the Shazam and Superman of this universe and knock them back.</p><h3>Aquatic Danger Sense</h3><p>Ramon has some short of danger sense similar to the sonar that some aquatic creatures have displayed. It warns him of things that happen in his immediate area.</p><h3>Intellect (Marine Biology)</h3><p>Ramon is marine biologist with the corresponding knowledge. He is also a very active environmentalist, shown saving some seals and helping contain an oil spill.</p><h3>Unarmed Combat</h3><p>Ramon has shown he is a capable fighter, helped by his brother who is a trained police officer.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><h3>Dehydration</h3><p>Ramon can be dehydrated in environments that are very dry and needs periodic hydration.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Salden was a police officer the super-high gravity planet of Krypton in a distant galaxy. Although there was still a need for guards and policemen, violence, crime and war were apparently rare as Krypton was very advanced in science and philosophy. Thus the law enforcement evolved toward a low number of officers, but most of those were genetically enhanced to be huge and extremely strong. Salden wasn't, and next to his fellow officers he looked tiny and weak. He compensated by being unusually brave and working out constantly to bulk himself up.</p><p>Salden, an excellent police officer despite his human size, had a running vendetta with a villain named <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/gundor-gorrok/4005-86697/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86697\">Gorrok</a>, one of his world's most dangerous criminals. When Gorrok escaped from prison, he headed for Salden's home, hoping to kill the officer. The ambush was disrupted by the police before Salden could arrive and Gorrok had to flee, but he killed his enemy's <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lyella/4005-86696/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86696\">wife</a> so he'd have his revenge no matter what.</p><p>Gorrok fled toward a newly developed teleportation ship, using a newfound green element to travel to any point in the universe. He programmed it to just leave for any planet with a breathable atmosphere, but the pursuing Salden was too close. Gorrok decided to let the weaker Salden in and left immediately after, thinking he'd just kill the man while in transit.</p><p>Gorrok's tried to fight Salden and damaged the ship's guidance system, and Salden had take the controls to prevent the ship from crashing into Earth. This allowed the Gorokk to knock him out and escape, leaving him to die within the ship as it sunk beneath the Earth's oceans.</p><p>Finding himself trapped in a sinking ship under miles of seawater, Salden thought he was about to drown, but the green element that fueled the ship mixed with the water that was pouring over him, granting him the strength he needed to escape. In the following days, he wandered through Los Angeles, learned English and acquainted himself with the human culture.</p><p>Salden's main objective was to somehow get home, but for that he needed very advanced technology. Reasoning that the incredible amount of war, crime and terrorism on Earth was what was holding back technological growth, he decided to act as a super-policeman to speed progress along by removing such hindrances.</p><p>Salden, soon to be nicknamed \"Superman\" by the press, also went through various odds and ends to make money, such as a one-time circus performance. Lois Lane, an exceptionally greedy and talented agent, quickly sunk her teeth into him, exploiting Superman to sell stories. To keep the stories coming, Lane remained close to Superman even when that meant unreasonable danger.</p><p>When Salden had to give a name, he came up with \"Clark Kent\", based on a nearby poster and a street sign.</p><p>Superman soon joined the emerging Justice League of America of his reality after defeating Gorokk.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>The combination of living in a high-gravity environment, along with the energizing effects of the green element give Salden amazing powers to use a Superman. He is superhumanly strong, super fast, very durable, and can see for miles in Earth's thinner atmosphere. His hi-tech flight harness allows him to fly.</p>",

Her father, Yoshio Sato, was the last and best of the traditional assassins employed by the Yakuza of Japan. Her father tried to leave the Yakuza when he discovered Sonia was his daughter. He was eventually killed by the Blood Soldiers (super-powered villains employed by the Yakuza).</p><h2><span>Creation</span></h2><p>Sonia Sato was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41294\" href=\"/gail-simone/4040-41294/\">Gail Simone</a>. Her first appearance is Birds of Prey #100.</p><h2><span>Character Evolution</span></h2><p>Sonia adopted the Judomaster identity to repent for her father’s past deeds and has since been on the run from the Blood Soldiers. She first sought the help of Oracle, who she agreed to help out with a mission for the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-22572\" href=\"/birds-of-prey/4060-22572/\">Birds of Prey</a>. When the Blood Soldiers found her the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\" href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\">Justice Society of America</a> stepped in to help. The Blood Soldiers were defeated as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-33348\" href=\"/tiger/4005-33348/\">Tiger</a> watched on the sidelines. Sonia was placed in the JSA care where she has remained.</p><h2><span>Major Story Arcs</span></h2><p>During Gog arch, Sonia initially was on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55664\" href=\"/gog/4005-55664/\">Gog</a>´s side, but when the JSA discover the truth, she fights against him. After Gog is defeated all the gifts he gave to the various JSA members were taken from them including the restoration of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3582\" href=\"/damage/4005-3582/\">Damage</a>'s face. He once again sunk into despair until Sonia removed his mask and kissed him, showing that she cared about the man inside, not outside. The two began dating afterwords. Sonia joins the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57325\" href=\"/jsa-all-stars/4060-57325/\">All-Stars</a> when the JSA divide.

It was revealed to be a trick to revive Black Lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62833\" href=\"/kal-l/4005-62833/\">Kal-L</a> again.</p><p>After Blackest Night, a depressed Sonia decided to came back with her objective to kill White Tiger, who killed her father. She was about to kill him when KIng Chimera appear and show her a video made by Damage where he tell her that he knew that he would die in the Blackes Night. He told her to live happy and never forget all the time that they spend together. Judomaster decided to only defeat White Tiger in combat, steal a payment for a murder and use it to help the people of Georgia who were hurt after Damage's manifestation of powers.</p><h2><span>Skills and Abilities</span></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3347/1939008-judomaster_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1939008\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.71059113300493\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3347/1939008-judomaster_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1939008\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3347/1939008-judomaster_1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3347/1939008-judomaster_1.jpg 812w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3347/1939008-judomaster_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Sonia appears to be highly skilled in the martial arts.

    "description": "<p> </p><h2>Origin</h2><p>As of yet little is known of her past other than the fact that she owns a tattoo parlour.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Her first appearance was in <a href=\"/grimm-fairy-tales-presents-call-of-wonderland/4050-49367/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-49367\">Grimm Fairy Tales Presents: Call of Wonderland</a> #2.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Thus far very little development has occurred for the character.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p><a href=\"/julie-sands/4005-85076/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85076\">Julie Sands</a> is originally introduced as a character entering a library late in the evening on the weekend. Once inside she encounters the <a href=\"/queen-of-spades/4005-85071/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85071\">Queen of Spades</a>, who gives her a journal written by <a href=\"/hp-lovecraft/4005-10641/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10641\">H.P. Lovecraft</a>. In reading it she becomes aware that the story is more than fiction and aspect of it are true. She is attacked by an unknown monster in the library but manages to escape. Outside she faces once again the same male students, but resorts to some quick physical violence to deal with them. She later finds a business card for a tattoo parlor and goes to investigate, all the while discovering how Lovecraft's journal ties into the realm of <a href=\"/wonderland/4020-44649/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44649\">Wonderland</a>. After arriving to the Tattoo Parlor she discovers its owner and operator Salome Gray battling a monster the likeness of which she tattooed on a client's back. The two escape together and try to find some answers. After escaping they journey together to an abandoned house where they discover a pathway to Wonderland. When they arrive there they discover the Red Knight who is keen on destroying them. Salome engages the knight while Julie battles a nearby sea monster. In the process they discover that Julie has the power of words in Wonderland while Salome has the power of drawing. They vanquish their foes and return to Earth, but they are drawn back into Wonderland by the power of the Queen of Spades, who needs them to fill the role of the Queen of Hearts in Wonderland.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As of yet she has not exhibited any special powers. She appears to be streetsmart and is a capable motorcycle driver. Like other characters that visit Wonderland she can exert control over things there through her own willpower.</p><p>It is implied in other series that the land of Wonderland is similar to that of Myst. If that is the case then Julie is likely correspondingly a Wonderland version of a falseblood.</p><p>It is unknown if her assumption of the role as the Queen of Hearts has given her any increased power.</p><h2>Depiction</h2><p>As with the majority of other female characters in the <a href=\"/grimm-fairy-tales-multiverse/4015-56105/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56105\">Grimm Fairy Tales universe</a>, the depiction of Salome differs markedly between cover art and the interior depictions of the characters. <a href=\"/zenescope-entertainment/4010-1986/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1986\">Zenescope</a> series are well known for both their suggestive and sometimes exploitative depiction of women on the covers while equally portraying women as strong female characters within most of their stories.</p>",

Despite escaping she left an aspect of herself behind in the realm. This meant that throughout her life that she was perceived to be crazy. She managed a relatively regular life with her high school sweetheart and even married and had two children, but an aspect of the madness always remained.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Alice first appeared in <a href=\"/grimm-fairy-tales-return-to-wonderland/4050-19825/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19825\">Grimm Fairy Tales Presents: Return to Wonderland</a> #0. She is based off of the main character from the novel Alice in Wonderland.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Throughout the multitude of series based around Wonderland the internal turmoil of Alice has been shown. Having left an aspect of her personality behind in Wonderland she struggled for a normal childhood despite the fact that she was accepted at school and had many friends. Later on after marrying Lewis Liddle and giving birth to <a href=\"/calie-liddle/4005-58999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58999\">Calie</a> and <a href=\"/mad-hatter/4005-58811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58811\">Johnny</a>, she undergoes something akin to a nervous breakdown.

For instance, after reaching new depths of her battle against depression, Alice is given a white rabbit as a pet in order that it might calm her. The <a href=\"/white-rabbit/4005-21464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21464\">white rabbit</a> is also a key creature in the original Wonderland story by Carroll (though the rabbit has a smaller influence on the overall Wonderland story lines.)</p><p>As with her daughter, she is sometimes displayed with different names, though these are generally some play on the name Alice. For instance, for a time in Wonderland she is called Lacie though this is simply the letters from the name Alice rearranged (as is the name of her daughter Calie.)</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723711-alice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723711\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 440px\" data-ratio=\"1.0568181818182\" data-width=\"440\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723711-alice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723711\"><img alt=\"Alice attempts suicide.\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723711-alice.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723711-alice.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" data-width=\"605\"></a><figcaption>Alice attempts suicide.</figcaption></figure><p>Alice first appears as a supporting character in the series Return to Wonderland.

Eventually her mother comes to her aid and forces Calie back to Earth. There Calie finds that her mother has committed suicide. The Wonderland version of her remains though and she eventually confronts her son Johnny who has become the Mad Hatter.

There is still a version of Alice which resides within Wonderland. Eventually the child in Wonderland makes a deal with the Jabberwocky to switch over to the other world and imprisoning the more fully grown Alice in the Wonderland on the other side of the mirror.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723741\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 592px\" data-ratio=\"0.70101351351351\" data-width=\"592\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723741\"><img alt=\"Alice is delivered to the March Hare\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg 592w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Alice is delivered to the March Hare\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg 592w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2723741-alice.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alice is delivered to the March Hare</figcaption></figure><p>The older Alice is now a prisoner of the Jabberwocky while the younger Alice has taken the place of the free Alice and proceeds to live Alice Liddle's life (at this point he is on the verge of going to her prom with her future husband.) Alice in Wonderland remains as a prisoner of the Jabberwocky for some time, until the schemes of others allow her to escape once the White Rabbit gets her free. She thus proceeds on some of the more common elements of the classic story. She comes across the Walrus, who first threatens to eat her but then offers her food. In so doing she exposes her to the murderous Carpenter. Alice escapes from him and then again soon again afterwards from the Cheshire Cat. She proceeds to a home in the forest where she meets a pleasant old woman. However, she is revealed to be the <a href=\"/drake-liddle/4005-105177/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-105177\">Mad Hatter</a> in disguise. He drugs her and takes her to the <a href=\"/march-hare/4005-85102/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85102\">March Hare</a>, who had made a deal with the Hatter. He turns the table on the Hare though as the <a href=\"/queen-of-spades/4005-85071/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85071\">Queen of Spades</a> has given him the <a href=\"/ebony-blade/4055-56489/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56489\">Ebony Blade</a> which can bring permanent death to those in Wonderland. During the confrontation between the Hare and the Hatter they are distracted and Alice escapes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723746\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1017px\" data-ratio=\"0.45034414945919\" data-width=\"1017\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723746\"><img alt=\"Split panel with Alice and the Queen of Hearts, showing the two preparing for battle.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg 1017w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Split panel with Alice and the Queen of Hearts, showing the two preparing for battle.\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg 1017w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/9/92932/2723746-alice.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Split panel with Alice and the Queen of Hearts, showing the two preparing for battle.</figcaption></figure><p>She soon after comes under the control of the Queen of Hearts, who starts off having an amicable friendship with her, but when she interferes in a game of croquet she puts her on mock trial so that she can be executed. The <a href=\"/queen-of-spades/4005-85071/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85071\">Queen of Spades</a> intervenes at the last moment and tells Alice how she can escape from Wonderland. This is for the selfish purpose of the Queen of Spades as she herself wants to rule Wonderland. Alice has a degree of power transferred to her and then meets the Jabberwocky in battle. She confronts one of his soldiers named Gravity, who is an ancestor of Alice. Eventually she is victorious. She finds out from the Queen of Spades that a miniscule portion of the Jabberwocky which was left in the real world Alice has been eliminated but the Queen also reveals that all the unfortunate events which will befall the Liddle family have already been set and that there is nothing that he can do to change them.</p><p>When her son Johnny entered Wonderland, she had since become a prisoner of the Mad Hatter. When the Hatter abducted Johnny and brings him to his dungeon, Johnny found her as a fellow prisoner. As the Hatter revealed himself to be Drake, he then attempted to violate Alice until Johnny escaped his bonds and proceeded to choke him. However, as her version back on Earth is dead, Alice was slowly fading and asked him to end her suffering.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Wallace is an inventor from Wigan, Lancashire, in the north of England, who has created numerous gadgets, ranging from those that help around the house (getting him up in the morning, dressing him and preparing breakfast) to time machines and moon rockets. He lives with his pet dog Gromit, who is just as inventive and generally more sensible and grounded, and has an inordinate fondness for cheese.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Wallace and Gromit were created by Nick Park, a member of Peter Lord and David Sproxton's Aardman Animation (the company that had previously created <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82432\" href=\"/morph/4005-82432/\" slug=\"morph\">Morph</a>, and later made the movies Chicken Run, Flushed Away and Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists), and the pair debuted on June 3rd 1989 in the clay-mation short film A Grand Day Out, which followed them on a trip to the moon to replenish Wallace's stock of cheese. Several subsequent films followed, both short and feature length, with Wallace being voiced by veteran British actor Peter Sallis in most of them (Ben Whitehead handled the role for the Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures computer games).</p><p>Wallace and Gromit made the transition to comics with the book <a data-ref-id=\"4050-51225\" href=\"/wallace-gromit/4050-51225/\" slug=\"wallace-gromit\">Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Lost Slipper</a>. A handful of subsequent books followed, both original stories and graphic novel adaptations of the films. In October 2005 <a data-ref-id=\"4010-2560\" href=\"/titan-magazines/4010-2560/\" slug=\"titan-magazines\">Titan Magazines</a> launched the Wallace &amp; Gromit Comic, which initially serialised some of the existing Wallace &amp; Gromit hardcovers before publishing additional new stories. It came to an end with the 26th issue in Autumn 2007, but the pair have since featured in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-35039\" href=\"/beanomax/4050-35039/\" slug=\"beanomax\">BeanoMax</a> and in a newspaper strip in the newspaper The Sun, the latter produced by Titan, who also make the strip available as a download.</p>",

    "description": "<h2><span>Origin</span></h2><p>Gromit is a dog who lives with his friend Wallace, an inventor, in the northern English town of Wigan, Lancashire. Though Wallace is presumably Gromit's nominal owner, Gromit is only notionally a pet, instead acting as Wallace's housekeeper, assistant (in inventing and in whatever business Wallace has set them up in using said inventions), and general... dogsbody. He's not a servant though, undertaking these tasks because he is the more sensible and grounded of the pair, and because he knows that if he doesn't, then his friend will forget to look after himself while focussed on a goal, or end up in serious trouble when one of his creations goes awry.</p><h2><span>Creation</span></h2><p>Wallace and Gromit were created by Nick Park, a member of Peter Lord and David Sproxton's Aardman Animation (the company that had previously created <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82432\" href=\"/morph/4005-82432/\" slug=\"morph\">Morph</a>, and later made the movies Chicken Run, Flushed Away and Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists), and the pair debuted on June 3rd 1989 in the clay-mation short film A Grand Day Out, which followed them on a trip to the moon to replenish Wallace's stock of cheese. Several subsequent films followed, both short and feature length.</p><p>Wallace and Gromit made the transition to comics with the book <a data-ref-id=\"4050-51225\" href=\"/wallace-gromit/4050-51225/\" slug=\"wallace-gromit\">Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Lost Slipper</a>. A handful of subsequent books followed, both original stories and graphic novel adaptations of the films. In October 2005 <a data-ref-id=\"4010-2560\" href=\"/titan-magazines/4010-2560/\" slug=\"titan-magazines\">Titan Magazines</a> launched the Wallace &amp; Gromit Comic, which initially serialised some of the existing Wallace &amp; Gromit hardcovers before publishing additional new stories. It came to an end with the 26th issue in Autumn 2007, but the pair have since featured in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-35039\" href=\"/beanomax/4050-35039/\" slug=\"beanomax\">BeanoMax</a> and in a newspaper strip in the newspaper The Sun, the latter produced by Titan, who also make the strip available as a download.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Tony is a friend of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6749\" href=\"/charles-dodgson/4005-6749/\">Charles Dodgson</a>.  His son is a standout baseball player, but while Tony is proud of him for his accomplishments, he is also jealous of him as he is better than he is.  Tony feels as though his son is always showing off, and intends to teach him how to be a real man.  Some years ago, Tony's father did the same and was eventually pushed through the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56488\" href=\"/mirror-to-wonderland/4055-56488/\">mirror to Wonderland</a> by Charles.  Now Tony thinks the only way to rescue him is to also push him into Wonderland.  They go to the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58999\" href=\"/calie-liddle/4005-58999/\">Liddle</a> house and while preparing to push in his son, his son gets a headache (insinuated to be caused by the abuse.)  Tony starts berating him for acting feminine, and his son snaps and shoves his father through the mirror.  Charles shows up and tells the son to leave.  In <a data-ref-id=\"4020-44649\" href=\"/wonderland/4020-44649/\">Wonderland</a> Tony literally tears himself apart into the Tweedle twins and goes in search of food.  They find a diner like building and a huge feast, but then they are found by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-69904\" href=\"/the-carpenter/4005-69904/\">Carpenter</a> who murders them both.  It is revealed that the Carpenter is their father.  </p>",
