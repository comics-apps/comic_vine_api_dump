    "deck": "Motoko Kusanagi is the main character in the Ghost in the Shell series, and one of the most popular manga characters of all time. She is a cyborg and squad leader of Japan's Public Security Section 9.",
    "description": "<h2>Creator</h2><p>The Major was created by renowned manga scribe, <a data-ref-id=\"4040-29751\" href=\"/masamune-shirow/4040-29751/\" slug=\"masamune-shirow\">Masamune Shirow</a>.</p><h2>Status</h2><p>Motoko Kusanagi, often referred to by the codename \"The Major\", is the commanding officer of her squad in Public Security <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49219\" href=\"/section-9/4060-49219/\" slug=\"section-9\">Section 9</a>, an intelligence department which operates under the authority of the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs. Section 9 operates in Niihama-Shi (New Port City) but its exact headquaters are top secret. Their mandate is to investigate cyber-crimes, and respond to technology based threats and terrorism. The Major has been involved in several high profile cases involving the likes of the Puppeteer, the Laughing Man, and the Individual Eleven.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The Major is a bit of a mystery. She tends to keep her human emotions well under control, and what remains of her personal life she mostly keeps to herself. What is known is that she was involved in a near-fatal plane crash when she was only a child. As a result, she underwent full cyberization at the age of nine with the only organic part of her remaining being a portion of her brain. She also initially had trouble adapting to the use of her new body and inadvertently broke one of her favorite toys, a doll. This incident was one of the only times that Motoko was shown capable of crying.</p><p>Later, Motoko became an elite forces squad leader and an expert in electronic warfare after years of intense training. It was as the leader of a covert-ops squad operating through Section 9 that she first met Chief <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49670\" href=\"/aramaki/4005-49670/\" slug=\"aramaki\">Aramaki</a> who recruited her. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49671\" href=\"/ishikawa/4005-49671/\" slug=\"ishikawa\">Ishikawa</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49220\" href=\"/batou/4005-49220/\" slug=\"batou\">Batou</a> (with whom she would seem to develop mutual feelings of attraction) may have served with her in the past during their tour of duty in the military. Other new recruits under Kusanagi's command include <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49669\" href=\"/togusa/4005-49669/\" slug=\"togusa\">Togusa</a>, Pazu, Borma and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49262\" href=\"/saito/4005-49262/\" slug=\"saito\">Saito</a>.</p><p>As stated, she often goes by the title \"Major\", but this may not be a formal rank. It is not yet known if Motoko held the rank of Major during her service with Japan's conventional military forces before becoming a covert-ops agent with Section 9 (which would explain why ex-military agents like Batou use the title when referring to her), or if the title evolved out of recognition for the leadership position she holds within her squad.</p><p>In the animated film series that was inspired by the Ghost in the Shell manga, Kusanagi fused with the \"Puppet Master\", codenamed Project 2501, and left Section 9. In the anime series she continues to lead the squad against various acts of cyber-terrorism, such as the cases involving the 'Laughing Man', the 'Individual Eleven', and the 'Puppeteer'.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>The depiction of Motoko Kusanagi's character is distinctly different from one version to the next, as each Ghost in the Shell adaption (the manga series, the movie series, and Stand Alone Complex TV series) follows a different time-line. In the original manga, The Major was a spunky and sometimes irreverant individual who nonetheless demonstrated a commending presence while on duty. In the film series she was portrayed as a more contemplative person with a sometimes brooding demeanor. This was a reflection of her tendency to question her own humanity and whether or not she had a soul (what cyborgs refer to as their \"ghost\"), a character trait that the film creators wished to emphasize. The anime series, Stand Alone Complex, and the film it inspired (Solid State Society) restored some of the humor to the character from the original manga that was lacking in the other film adaptions.</p><p>It has been suggested that Kusanagi may be lesbian since she has been intimate with other female cyborgs. This is common in part because of the high degree of compatibility with cybernetic devices in cyborgs of the same sex. It is much more likely however that the Major is bisexual as she has had boyfriends, and seems to have feelings for fellow Section 9 operative, Batou. Batou will also at times call her by her first name, Motoko, instead of using her title, which suggests he shares her feelings.</p><p>Lastly, Motoko is known for her provacative dress and attire (or lack of attire). And she will at times experiment with what others may deem \"human vices\" in an attempt to understand that part of her humanity, and in particular her femininity.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Motoko Kusanagi posseses an incredibly durable prosthetic body, with enhanced strength, speed and coordination. In fact, only part of her brain and spinal cord remain composed of human tissue. The cybernetic implants in her brain provide her with extraordinary hacking capabilities which she uses to hack into computer databases, and even other cyber-brains (a process known as ghost-hacking).</p><p>The Major is often regarded as the most powerful and dangerous agent of Section 9. She has extensive combat experience, is unusually intelligent, is an accomplished leader, and an expert in the martial arts. She also uses \"therm-optic\" camouflage to render herself invisible, giving her a tremendous advantage whenever stealth is required.</p><h3>Film - Ghost in the Shell and Ghost in the Shell: Innocence</h3><h3>Motoko Kusanagi as seen in the first GitS film</h3><p>This version of Motoko Kusanagi is far more subdued in terms of personality, to the point of brooding, but no less effective as a leader than her Manga counterpart. Throughout the first film she seems distant and detached as she is preoccupied by a rash of cyber-crimes instigated by the so called \"Puppet Master\" (Project 2501). The film focuses on her inner struggle to come to terms with her own nature, whether or not she has a \"ghost\" or if she has lost her humanity to the machine, and what it all portends for the nature of humanity in a world in which mankind and technology are becoming ever more inextricably linked.</p><p>Motoko has a much smaller presence in the sequel, Innocence, although she does appear in the film in a supporting role while aiding former partners Batou and Togusa.</p><h3>TV Series Film - Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Ghost in the Shell: SAC: Solid State Society</h3><p>In Stand Alone Complex, Motoko resembles her manga-self much more than in the films, although her banter-y relationship with Chief Aramaki isn't seen. Some fans have come to the conclusion that Motoko may be bisexual due to the content of several episodes combined with the rarity of her close relationships with men. This is also true of her Manga incarnation as mentioned earlier. Throughout the series however, Motoko and Batou seem to develop a closeness, as do Motoko and Hideo Kuze. During the series Kusanagi is also sometimes seen taking on the identity of \"Chroma\" while she is in the cyber-world, before returning to her real body. After the death of Kuze at the end of the second season, Motoko retires from Section 9 and practically disappears for a time. She is seen again in the film Solid State Society when the actions of the Puppeteer bring her and Section 9 (both conducting their own investigations) together again.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Megan was born the daughter of Deborah Kinney. At a young age, she was kidnapped and taken from her parents by an escaped murderer who was known to rape under-age girls. After being contacted by Megan's mother <a href=\"/debra-kinney/4005-71215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71215\">Debbie</a>, her estranged aunt <a href=\"/dr-sarah-kinney/4005-48139/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48139\">Sarah Kinney</a> took <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a> on an unauthorized personal mission, asking X-23 to track down and rescue Megan. X-23 successfully tracked Megan's abductor and posed as a girl scout as bait, freeing Megan and killed the man who took her. The ordeal left Megan traumatized however, she had nightmares about the man and X-23 for many years, convincing herself that it never happened until her teen years when she was introduced to her previously unknown cousin Laura (X-23), after Laura's mothers' death.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Megan Kinney was created by created by writers Craig Kyle, Chris Yost, and artist Billy Tan. She first appeared in 2005's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-23/4050-18176/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18176\"><em>X-23</em></a> #2.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Target X<b><br /></b></h3><p>Megan was initially hostile towards Laura before Laura revealed that Megan's kidnapping had actually happened, proving it by unsheathing her claws in front of her cousin, unaware that Megan had repressed those memories. Following this revelation, Megan formed a special bond with Laura and the two became best friends while attending school together, with Laura even adopting Megan's gothic dress sense. Laura eventually told Megan the whole truth about her past, abilities and the circumstances about her mother's death, including the effects of the <a href=\"/trigger-scent/4055-56712/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56712\">Trigger Scent</a>. <a href=\"/desmond-alexander/4005-71281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71281\">Desmond</a> (<a href=\"/the-facility/4060-48035/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48035\">Facility</a> agent and boyfriend of Megan's mother) put a dose of Trigger Scent in Debbie‚Äôs tea, because he wanted Laura to kill her aunt and Megan before returning her to the Facility. Unfortunately for Desmond, Megan accidentally spilled the tea over him and Debbie, causing Laura to go into a berserker rampage and kill him before turning her attention to Megan and Debbie. Megan quickly grabbed her mother and hid in the shower, washing all of the trigger scent off their bodies just as Laura was about to kill them, allowing Laura to regain her self control.</p><p>Laura sensed that <a href=\"/kimura/4005-41489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41489\">Kimura</a> was near and hid Megan and Debbie in the basement, hiding them from thermal sensors by showering them with freezing water from a burst pipe before killing all the soldiers of The Facility. However Laura was incapacitated by Kimura who broke her neck in the ensuing fight and took Laura into the basement to watch Megan and Debbie die. Kimura tortured the scared Megan but Laura managed to save her family by causing an explosion with Kimura still in the house and escaped with Megan and Debbie.</p><p>Laura gave her aunt and cousin a large amount of money and new identities to escape and create new lives for themselves, but told Megan that she couldn't go with them, not wishing to endanger them further and after a tearful separation, Megan and Debbie separated from Laura. Before leaving Megan gave her cousin Laura a necklace saying that she was going to give it to her when settling in.</p><p>Megan hasn't appeared since, though she has been mentioned by Laura and Kimura.</p>",

They first teamed up together in Monaco where they were searching for treasure in an old sunked ship. They were in a realtionship together. One night however Lara was getting tired and decided to go to bed while Chase went out to the casino to gamble. Chase did not appear the next morning at the scheduled time and stole the treasure from the ship. Because as Lara Croft dived down to the ship the secret compartment was empty and all that was left was Chase's calling card.</p><p> </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Chase Carver was created for the Tomb Raider comic book series and first appeared in the third issue. He was created by <a href=\"/dan-jurgens/4040-4321/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4321\"> Dan Jurgens</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Major story arcs</h2><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/162980-137235-lara-croft.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-162980\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.78\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/162980-137235-lara-croft.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-162980\"><img alt=\"Chase's death\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/162980-137235-lara-croft.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/162980-137235-lara-croft.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Chase's death</figcaption></figure><p>They would later team up again and Chase showed that he was sorry multiple times throughout the series. They both still had feelings for each other but Lara commented that she simply couldn't trust Chase anymore. It wasn't until later in the series that the feelings truly started to blossom again after having gone through multiple adventures together. But it was ultimately too late because Chase died when they were together in Honduras searching for the treasure of Christopher Columbus.</p><h2>Skills and abilities</h2><p>Chase was quick to think on his feet but he wasn't as skilled as Lara Croft in any way, shape or form. He could streetfight and fire a gun. He was also an adequate treasure hunter but he lacked the ability to find the big treasures on his own.</p><p> </p><h2>Other media</h2><p>It is generally viewed that Alex West from the Tomb Raider movie was based on Chase Carver because they are so similar in characteristics and personality.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Lionel Jeffries was a respected surgeon who along with his brother, Madison, elected to sign up for service during the Vietnam War. Both brothers were mutants, Madison with the power to transmute mechanical components, while Lionel had the power to transmute organic matter. While on patrol, the squad of men they were with were blown up. Body parts were scattered everywhere. Lionel attempted to reconstruct and bring the squad back to life using his power, when he was unsuccessful in this, his mind snapped and he had to restrained by Madison. He then became a patient at the Montreal General Hospital.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lionel Jeffries was created by Bill Mantlo and Mike Mignola and first appeared in <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/alpha-flight-30-enterscramble/4000-26386/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alpha Flight Vol. 1 issue 30</a> (1986).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>A Brother Found</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50325/1106752-scan0009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1106752\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.97288503253796\" data-width=\"1844\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1844px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50325/1106752-scan0009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1106752\"><img alt=\"Scramble, The Mixed-Up Man arises \" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/50325/1106752-scan0009.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50325/1106752-scan0009.jpg 1844w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/50325/1106752-scan0009.jpg 960w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/50325/1106752-scan0009.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Scramble, The Mixed-Up Man arises </figcaption></figure><p>While checking the Alphanex Computer, <a href=\"/vindicator/4005-5009/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5009\"> Heather Hudson</a> became aware that Madison Jeffries had a brother she was unaware of. Believing that she should search for people with potential powers as her husband had, she took an Omiship and flew to Montreal to see Lionel Jeffries. She was under the misapprehension that he was a surgeon at the hospital and was surprised to learn that he was in fact a patient there. Unaware of his powers, she got too close to him, he managed to manipulate her body and effected an escape. The rest of <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\"> Alpha Flight </a>appeared soon after and found her badly mutated. Scramble, meanwhile, had gone on a rampage throughout the hospital, mutating staff and patients alike. Alpha gave chase, but found themselves confronted by these mutates. While most of the team fought them, Madison Jeffries pursued his brother and faced him in the morgue. A physical fight broke out and Scramble mutated Madison's body. While in contact with Madison, and because of their close ties, Scramble became aware of the defects within his own brain. He managed to restructure his mind using Maddison's as a template. Returned to a semblance of sanity, he undid the damage he had caused at the hospital, also promising to undergo tests to see if this return to sanity was authentic.</p><h3>Against Alpha Flight and Death</h3><p>Following his discharge from the hospital, Lionel Jeffries had found it impossible to attain a post as a doctor at any hospital. So he had accepted the position as head doctor at a private clinic known as New Life. Alpha Flight had been taking injured and ill members to New Life, and Jeffries had almost become a kind of unofficial Alpha member. However he had also become a little more unstable during this time, when Alpha took their mentally disturbed member <a href=\"/box/4005-19987/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19987\"> Roger Bochs</a> to him. Scramble used Bochs paranoia to turn him against Alpha. He then used his own power to amalgamate his and Boch's bodies. The result of this union was the creature named Omega and it began an assault on Alpha Flight. Omega almost defeated Alpha, but during the course of the battle Roger Bochs returned to some semblance of sanity and started struggling from within. Scramble lobotomized Bochs to prevent interference, but the <a href=\"/persuasion/4005-28770/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28770\"> Purple Girl</a> managed to take control of him. Madison Jeffries considered the fact that Scramble was always going to be danger to society and used the Box Armour's weapons to destroy Omega.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/53715/1271519-omega_scramble.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1271519\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1029411764706\" data-width=\"272\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/53715/1271519-omega_scramble.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1271519\"><img alt=\" Transforming DNA\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/53715/1271519-omega_scramble.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/53715/1271519-omega_scramble.jpg 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\" data-width=\"272\"></a><figcaption> Transforming DNA</figcaption></figure><p>By making physical contact, Lionel has the ability to alter organic material such as flesh, blood and bone.

He has even been shown to \"see\" brains compared to each other, and if he wanted to could copy each synapse to synapse using another person's brain as a template to untwist a damaged mind.

He has been shown to use people and perhaps has powers to control them, since he has been seen with many young and beautiful woman who are unmoving. Though it was initially unclear what their condition is, it is certain that Captain Future has a large sexual appetite and no longer appears to be on the side of good. Not surprising, given that he has been subsequently revealed to be the latest Earthly avatar of <a href=\"/zeus/4005-21351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21351\">Zeus</a> (King of the Olympian gods, in Greek mythology!). And, that he is determined to recover the Promethean Flame from its current avatar...the superhero called the <a href=\"/the-flame/4005-24757/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24757\">Flame</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Used to be published by Pines Publishing but is now in the public domain.</p>",

    "deck": "The main character in \"The Witcher\" novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. He is a witcher, a monster hunting warrior who has been genetically altered through magic and mutagens. He is known as the best hunter in the land of Temeria.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Geralt is a witcher. A superhuman mutant monster slayer for hire. Shortly after his birth, Geralt was taken by his mother to Kaer Morhen, a witcher stronghold and The School of the Wolf. Whilst there, he was trained almost exclusively to kill monsters, practicing his swordsmanship skills and learning about monsters.</p><p>When he grew older, but was still in his early years, Geralt was subjected to mutations like all other witchers. Only 3 in 10 boys survive this ritual, and the rest die in agony. The mutations were caused by the consumption of special alchemical ingredients, which affected his body. This was called the Trial of the Grasses.</p><p>The witchers who survived gained enhanced physicals, such as speed, strength, stamina and durability beyond what an ordinary human could possess. Witchers have cat-like eyes, which give them night vision akin to a cat. The mutations also granted the witchers magical abilities, known as signs, which are more utility based, rather than combat-orientated. (They can be used in combat, though.) The signs include: Aard, a telekenetic blast. Igni, a burst of fire which can be used in combat, as well as being able to do things such as light candles. Yrden, a magical trap. Quen, a magical barrier.</p><p>Axii, a form of mind control. Heliotrope, a defense against magical and physical attacks. There is also Somne, a sign which puts targets to sleep, though that was only used in Season of Storms and we have not seen Geralt use it. In addition to the magical signs and enhanced physicals, witchers also have boosted metabolisms and stronger immune systems. This allows them to consume witcher potions, which even in small doses would be deadly to any ordinary human. The potions do different things such as enhancing a witcher's physical attributes even further and allowing them to see in the dark better. Witchers also have reduced heartbeat rates, making it take longer for them to bleed out. A side effect of the mutations is that it causes infertility in witchers.</p><p>On top of all these superhuman traits which all witchers including Geralt possess, Geralt and a few others were specially selected to be the subjects of even further mutation. Geralt was the only child who survived. This caused his to lose pigmentation in his hair, which made his hair turn a milk white colour. It also increased his physicals beyond that of even the best other witchers.</p><p>Despite his name, Geralt does not actually hail from Rivia. His exact birthplace is unknown. When it came time for Geralt to leave Kaer Morhen and venture out into the world as a witcher, he had to choose a surname or title to seem more trustworthy to potential clients. His first choice of name was \"Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde\", a Nilfgaardian name, though his trained Vesemir passed it off as silly and pretentious. Instead, Geralt adopted the unofficial title of, \"of Rivia\".</p><p>He even adopted a Rivian accent to make his name seem more authentic. Though his name was unofficial at first, he was officially knighted by Queen Lyve of Lyria for his valour during the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga, making the title \"of Rivia\" official. His actual birthplace is unknown, though it is probably somewhere in Kaedwin since that's where he was left to become a witcher.</p><h2>Nickname Origins</h2><p>Geralt of Rivia has been bestowed with many nicknames over the years, or lots of different reasons. I will go through all of them and their origins.</p><p><strong>White Wolf </strong>- Probably the most famous of all his nicknames, Geralt has been labeled the \"White Wolf\" due to the colour of his hair and because he trained at The Wolf School at Kaer Morhen. \"White Wolf\" translates to \"Gwynbleidd\" in Elder Speech, the language of the Aen Seidhe Elves.</p><p><strong>White One </strong>- Once again, this nickname is due to the colour of Geralt's hair.</p><p><strong>Kingslayer </strong>- In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, Geralt was falsely accused of murdering King Foltest and was labelled the Kingslayer. This label was mostly removed once Geralt brought the real killer to justice.</p><p><strong>Butcher of Blaviken </strong>- Geralt earned this nickname when he went to a village called Blaviken. There was a band of outlaws in town there to kill the sorcerer Stregabor. Stregabor wanted Geralt to kill the outlaws led by Renfri, whilst Renfri wanted Geralt to kill Stregabor, since he had wronged her in the past. Geralt refused both at first, and wanted to stay out of the conflict. Geralt realised that Renfri and her bandits were going to kill Stregabor and wipe out most of the village, so Geralt decided to stop the bandits preemptively, even though he agreed with Renfri morally. When he got there, the bandits refused to keep the peace, so Geralt killed them all, including, to his dismay, Renfri. When people came out of their homes, all they saw was Geralt bathed in blood. Since he didn't wait for them to do anything illegal and confronted them beforehand, people assumed that Geralt attacked them unprovoked as witchers already had a bad reputation. Due to the bloodbath he caused, Geralt was permanently banished from Blaviken and was labelled the \"Butcher of Blaviken\".</p><h2>Other Media</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3708115\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/3708115-hexer+1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/3708115-hexer+1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3708115\"><img alt=\"Michal Zebrowski as Geralt\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/3708115-hexer+1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/3708115-hexer+1.jpg 600w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/3708115-hexer+1.jpg 480w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/3708115-hexer+1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Michal Zebrowski as Geralt</figcaption></figure><p>In the Polish movie <b>Wiedzmin</b> (2001) and the following TV series (2002) Geralt of Rivia is played by Michal Zebrowski.</p><h4>Game Trilogy</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111144451/3836313-0363432438-witch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3836313\" data-ratio=\"0.97150259067358\" data-width=\"386\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 386px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111144451/3836313-0363432438-witch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3836313\"><img alt=\"Geralt in Witcher 1\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111144451/3836313-0363432438-witch.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111144451/3836313-0363432438-witch.jpg 386w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11114/111144451/3836313-0363432438-witch.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Geralt in Witcher 1</figcaption></figure><p>Geralt in <strong>The Witcher</strong>, a PC role playing game developed by CD Projekt RED.

    "description": "<p> </p><h2>General Description</h2><p>Let's face facts: Keitaro Urashima is what some people call a loser. He's 19 years old, has never had a girlfriend, failed his college entrance exams twice, and been kicked out of his parents' home. If hes got anything going for him it's that: A) He's generally a good guy, and B) He never gives up.</p><p>Unfortunately, Keitaro is either one of the world's biggest peeping toms, half the time it is not intentional peeping though. He is constantly walking in on women undressing, in the bath, or on the toilet. Improbable events will transpire that will inevitably lead to him accidentally groping female body parts. As punishment, he is often attacked and beaten up by the female residents (especially Naru and Motoko). His ability to endure these constant beat-downs(not mention falling from great heights, being ran into by Seta's van, and attacked by Su's weaponry) lead to several characters remarking that he must be immortal. It should be noted that although these peeping incidents are almost always portrayed as accidents, at the end of the book Keitaro admits that he likes to see Naru naked.</p><p>Love Hina is the story of how this pathetic schlub ends up with a houseful of female admirers and marrying his childhood sweetheart.</p><p> </p><h2>Keitaro at Home</h2><p>Not much is known about Keitaro's homelife; i'ts never actually shown in the manga. This much we do know: He has an adopted sister, <a href=\"/kanako-urashima/4005-49277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49277\"> Kanako Urashima</a>, and his parents own a dessert shop.</p><p>Keitaro has a rocky relationship with his parents. They've evicted him at the beginning of the manga, but later call and want him to come home. They check up on him several times through the series to make sure he's keeping his grades up. Once, they call him home and discuss his future.</p><p> </p><h2>Keitaro and Tokyo U</h2><p>The reason Keitaro tries so hard to get into Tokyo University(ignoring all others), is that when he was younger he made a promise to the only girl who had ever been kind to him. Keitaro and the girl had heard that if two people who love each other very much go to Tokyo U. together, they will live happily ever after. Keitaro does accomplish his dream, but due to several twists of fate, is never actually shown attending any Tokyo U. classes.</p><p> </p><h2>Keitaro at Hinata House</h2><p><b><i>Naru</i></b></p><p>The first resident Keitaro met upon arriving at Hinata House was <a href=\"/naru-narusegawa/4005-49030/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49030\"> Naru Narusegawa</a>. This encounter would set the stage for their relationship.</p><p>Believing that Hinata House was still a hotel, Keitaro decided to relax in the open-air bath. Unfortunately, Naru walked in on him. She wasn't wearing her glasses and at first thought he was <a href=\"/kitsune/4005-49052/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49052\"> Kitsune</a>. Of course, she soon realized this wasn't the case and she chased the strange, naked man around the house. Only the timely intervention of his aunt, <a href=\"/haruka-urashima/4005-49090/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49090\"> Haruka Urashima</a> saved Keitaro's hide.</p><p>Despite Keitaro's repeated accidental perversity, and despite Naru's violent tendencies, they soon became rather close(although neither would admit it). Keitaro comes to believe that Naru is the girl he made his promise to, although she later disavows him of this notion.</p><p>Their relationship becomes strained when they both fail their entrance exams. Keitaro is rather used to failure, but Naru was formerly the top student in the nation. They get into an argument, and indivually decide to go on a vacation to forget their troubles. They reconcile on the trip and meet someone who will come to play a very important role in their lives; <a href=\"/mutsumi-otohime/4005-49051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49051\"> Mutsumi Otohime</a>.</p><p>Returning from the trip, Keitaro briefly deicdes to quit school, and also learns about Naru's past with <a href=\"/noriyasu-seta/4005-49059/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49059\"> Noriyasu Seta</a>. This causes another rift in their relationship, which soon healed... Until Mutsumi returns.</p><p><b><i>Mutsumi</i></b></p><p>Keitaro and Naru first meet Mutsumi while on a \"journey of regret and self-discovery\". She is a clumsy and sickly young woman who is constantly passing out. She and Keitaro have a lot in common, including a Tokyo U. promise. Naru even goes so far as to call her a female version of Keitaro. He and Mutsumi get along very well because they're so much alike. His closeness to Mutsumi causes some friction with Naru, even though in Keitaro's mind, he prefers Naru. Things are brought to a head, when due to a chain of events, she is believed to be pregnant with Keitaro's baby.</p><p>In the middle volumes of Love Hina, it's revealed that Keitaro, Naru, and Mutsumi all played together at Hinata House when they were younger. Because of this, and because of their similar stories, Keitaro and Mutsumi are suspected of making their childhood promise to each other. After it becomes evident that this isn't the case, Mutsumi plays a much smaller role in the story.</p><p><b><i>Motoko</i></b></p><p>The first girl we come to really know at Hinata House, besides Naru, is <a href=\"/motoko-aoyama/4005-49043/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49043\"> Motoko Aoyama</a>. She is a very serious high school student and dedicated swordsman. She also seems to hate men in general, and Keitaro in particular. She calls him weak, perverted, and unmanly. She soon starts feeling weak in his presence, but it turns out to just be a cold.</p><p>A turning point in their relationship comes when Motoko's sister, <a href=\"/tsuruko-aoyama/4005-49234/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49234\"> Tsuruko Aoyama</a>, comes to visit her and forcibly took her to perform her duty as the Shinmei-ry≈´ sword school successor. Motoko lied to her and tells her she is going to get married to Keitaro. Tsuruko finds out that she is lying and declares that as punishment, she and Keitaro must marry immediately. Tsuruko gave them the condition that if Motoko manages to defeat her within the allotted time given, the marriage between Motoko and Keitaro would be cancelled. Motoko manage to indirectly defeat her sister, but realizes that she really does have feelings for Keitaro. During the conversation with Shinobu and Motoko before Naru and Keitaro's wedding, it is hinted that she is still in love with him and not willing to give up.</p><p> </p><p><b><i>Shinobu</i></b></p><p><a href=\"/shinobu-maehara/4005-49044/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49044\"> Shinobu Maehara</a> is the youngest resident of Hinata House. Despite getting off to a rocky start, she develops a crush on Keitaro and calls him \"sempai\". She likes him because she's really shy and sensitive, and Keitaro is always kind to her. Keitaro agrees to tutor her, and when he and Naru are fighting he even agrees to be Shinobu's \"date\" to the fair. She realizes that he would be happier if he wasn't fighting with Naru, and goes off to look for her. Probably due to their distance in age, Keitaro never develops romantic feelings for Shinobu.</p><p> </p><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>By the series end Keitaro is more like Seta than ever, and is finally preparing to marry his promise girl.</p>",

    "deck": "Su is an extremely hyperactive exchange student from the island of Molmol. She is a technological genius and is constantly making new inventions.",
    "description": "<a href=\"/\"></a><h2>General Information</h2><p>Kaolla Su's most defining characteristic is her boundless energy. She is always in motion; either cannonballing into the Hinata hot springs or giving <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49028\" href=\"/keitaro-urashima/4005-49028/\">Keitaro Urashima</a> a boot to the face. Her enthusiasm hides the fact that she is afraid of change. In a later volume of Love Hina, Su reveals she's a princess and kidnaps Keitaro to her home island of Molmol. Her plan was to move Hinata House to the island so things would always stay the same.</p><p>Su is also a master of technology and has all the latest video game consoles. Throughout the course of the series she manufactures various tracking devices, stealth suits, cannons and missiles. Her most famous inventions are the Mecha Tama-Chans, devised to combat the threat of the <a data-ref-id=\"49091\" href=\"/tama-chan/49091/\">turtle scourge</a>! A list of Su's inventions appears in the trivia section of this article.</p><p>Su has a tremendous appetite. When she's introduced to something new she has a habit of asking if it tastes good or if she can eat it. She'll usually be seen eating bananas, and is involved in several failed attempts to eat Tama-chan. When the Hinata residents performed a summer play for local children, Su happily portrayed the pig.</p><p>Su undergoes a transformation whenever there's a red moon. She changes into an adult version of herself. Su says she feels closer to her homeland when this happens because the desert winds often cause a red moon on Molmol.</p> <a href=\"/\"></a><h2>At Hinata House</h2><p>Su was the third resident to arrive at Hinata House, after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49052\" href=\"/kitsune/4005-49052/\">Kitsune</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49030\" href=\"/naru-narusegawa/4005-49030/\">Naru Narusegawa</a>. She is the second youngest and is one grade ahead of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49044\" href=\"/shinobu-maehara/4005-49044/\">Shinobu Maehara</a>.</p><p>Su has tendency to latch on to someone. Naru and Kitsune were both glad when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49043\" href=\"/motoko-aoyama/4005-49043/\">Motoko Aoyama</a> arrived, because she was the only one who had the stamina to keep up with Su. Su's friendship with Motoko borders on the romantic, at least as far as Su is concerned. To Motoko's consternation, she is Su's first kiss.(Su says Motoko tastes like soy sauce). In Molmol, when Su was plotting to marry Keitaro, she tells him that she also plans on taking Motoko as a lover/bodyguard.</p><p>Despite being several years younger than Su, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49060\" href=\"/sarah-macdougal/4005-49060/\">Sarah Macdougal</a> becomes her companion in mischief. They are usually seen hanging around together and they discover the secret passages inside Hinata House. They also share a love of beating up Keitaro.</p><p>Despite the constant beatings(or perhaps because he can withstand them), Su has great affection for Keitaro. She teases him and will often try to stuff him full of food(usually curry-flavored). Su later explains to Keitaro and Naru that they remind her of her brother and sister back home.</p><p>Su lives in room 301. Keitaro is shocked the first time he enters her room because she has made it resemble the rain forests of her homeland.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>The Island of Molmol</h2><p>Molmol is an island in the south Pacific Ocean; located near the International Date Line. Along with Parakelse, it was once part of the Great Turtle Civilization that ruled the Pacific Ocean. Su is a member of the current ruling family that includes her mother, brother, and sister. None of her family are actually shown in the manga, though her brother does send Keitaro a letter inviting him to study in Molmol.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>The final two chapters of Love Hina are an epilogue that takes place several years after the bulk of the main story. It is revealed that Su has gone to Tokyo University(like the other residents apart from Kitsune) and is a third year law student. She is still a bit of a mad scientist and shows off the Sarah robot she had made.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"/\"></a><h2>About Naru</h2><p>Naru Narusegawa is an uptight, stubborn, very violent resident of Hinata House. She was the second of the residents to arrive, and was formerly a very poor student, with a habit of daydreaming. That all changed with the services of her tutor; <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49059\" href=\"/noriyasu-seta/4005-49059/\">Noriyasu Seta</a>. She developed a crush on him and is determined to get admitted into Tokyo University to because of him. Despite her violent outbursts, she is prone to moments of kindness.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>(SPOILER WARNING)</h2><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>L'histoire de Naru</h2><p>Though she wouldn't remember it until much later, Naru first came to Hinata House as a youngster. She was a sickly child and her parents would travel with her in hopes that the different environment would be better for her health. While at Hinata House, she met a young <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49028\" href=\"/keitaro-urashima/4005-49028/\">Keitaro Urashima</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49051\" href=\"/mutsumi-otohime/4005-49051/\">Mutsumi Otohime</a>. It was from these two that she would learn of Tokyo University, which would become her first words. Again, however, due to her young age, she wouldn't remember this encounter until much later.</p><p>Naru grew up and became a student. A rather poor student. Her parents sent her to Hinata House(now a girls dorm) to help with her studies. Naru was the second resident to arrive, after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49052\" href=\"/kitsune/4005-49052/\">Kitsune</a>. Naru was popular with the male students in her class, but she never returned the attention. She was still having problems with her schoolwork, so she was given a tutor: Seta. Naru developed an unrequited crush on Seta and went from a laid-back dreamer to the determined and dedicated number one student in Japan. Seta left to go overseas, but Naru promised him that one day she would get into Tokyo University.</p><p>Things were going rather smoothly for Naru, until Keitaro arrived. Keitaro was trying to get into Tokyo U, but had failed two years in a row. He had to stay with his grandmother at Hinata House, but was unaware that it had been transformed to a girls dorm. He was relaxing in the hot springs, when Naru walked in on him. Believing him to be some sort of pervert, she chased him around Hinata House. Only the timely intervention of Keitaro's Aunt Haruka saved him.</p> <p>Taking pity on the pervert, Naru began tutoring Keitaro. Keitaro, for his part, began wondering if Naru was the girl he had made a promise to go Tokyo University with when he was younger. On the day of their exams he confronted her about this, but she denied it. Keitaro was heartbroken and perhaps unsurprisingly failed his exams. He went to congratulate Naru, who in a moment of shock and awe, reveals that she too has failed her exams. They go drinking to forget their troubles, but end up blaming each other for their failures. Naru decides to take a vacation to ease her mind.</p><p>Unfortunately, on her trip to forget all about her exams and the pervert, she kept running into Keitaro. It's revealed that they both read the same brochure in the Hinata House lobby, and were following the same vacation route. Putting their differences aside, they decided to travel together. It was on this trip that they encountered Mutsumi Otohime again, although none of them would remember their childhood meeting at this point. As a present, Mutsumi gave them a pet turtle, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49091\" href=\"/tama-chan/4005-49091/\">Tama-chan</a>.</p><p>Arriving back at Hinata House, Naru was disappointed to find out that Keitaro was looking for a part-time job, and might give up on Tokyo U. In a twist of fate, Keitaro got a job working as an assistant for Naru's old tutor, Seta. When Keitaro found this out, he felt that Seta and Naru were destined to be together... but it was not to be. Naru told Keitaro that she had nothing more than a crush on Seta. She did not tell Keitaro that she was pleased that he had decided not to quit trying for Tokyo University.</p><p>As thanks to Naru for helping him study, Keitaro took her out on a date. Soon after, Tama-chan bade everyone goodbye and wandered off. Worried, the Hinata House residents searched and finally found her with Mutsumi. Mutsumi was moving to the area to help with her studies, and she was soon spending much time with Keitaro and Naru. It was around this time, that Naru found an old photograph and discovered that she, Keitaro, and Mutsumi had all known each other at Hinata House when they were younger. Now she was able to deduce why Keitaro and Mutsumi's tales of a childhood promise seemed so similar. They must have made the promise to each other. As she was beginning to grow quite fond of Keitaro, Naru was heartbroken to discover that the older couple were seemingly destined to be together. Still, she did the right thing and told them on Christmas Eve night. However, Keitaro had also grown quite fond of Naru and was unable to choose Mutsumi just like that. (Mutsumi, for her part, was unable to comprehend what was going on.)</p> <p>The three formed a love triangle that existed for some time. Things were complicated by Mutsumi's house burning down, causing her to stay at Hinata House. One day the three of them were walking amidst the cherry blossoms, when something... clicked in Mutsumi's head. She suddenly remembered Naru and Keitaro as children, and she remembered who she made her promise to. Unfortunately for the other two, she wants to keep it to herself until after the exams.</p><p>After the exams, Naru and Mutsumi went looking for Keitaro but were unable to find him. They figured he must have failed his exams and run off again. They finally received a fax from him a few weeks later. Keitaro wrote that he was on the island of Parakelse and not to come looking for him. Naru, however, was through putting up with Keitaro's shenanigans and was determined to bring him back, even if it was against his will.</p><p>She arrived on Parakelse, and was surprised to find Keitaro was helping Seta with excavations. She was even more surprised to find that Keitaro had developed a tan and had become quite the little hottie. She, Keitaro, and a native girl named Nyamo became trapped in the desert, but were rescued by the Hinata House residents who had come to Parakelse to tell Keitaro and Naru that they both had made it into Tokyo University. After some pulse-pounding escapades, the gang left Parakelse and returned home.</p><p>Naru's burgeoning friendship with Keitaro was soon tested when he finally told her that he loved her. Unable to deal with the thought of being in a serious relationship, she spent several weeks avoiding him. Finally, after some time observing Seta's and Haruka's tangled romance, Naru told Keitaro that she loved him... maybe. They would exist in this semi-romantic state until Keitaro left to study abroad, and his sister, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49277\" href=\"/kanako-urashima/4005-49277/\">Kanako Urashima</a> took control of Hinata House.</p> <p>Kanako transformed the Hinata Girls Dorm back into an inn, and instituted a tyrannical regime that forced the other residents into a rebellion. Naru had sided with Kanako, hoping to befriend Keitaro's adopted sister. This proved to be short-lived when Naru revealed that she was (probably) Keitaro's promise girl. Only Keitaro's timely return from the US saved Hinata House and Naru from destruction.</p><p>You must understand that Kanako had \"certain feelings\" for her adopted brother. She tried to compete with Naru for his affections, and finally tricked him into entering the Hinata Annex with her. The Hinata Annex was a sealed off portion of Hinata House that was legendary for it's power to cement relationships. Naru attempted to come between the two, but each time she was kept back by a mysterious force. At last giving up in despair, Naru attempted to flee to the very edge of Japan. Keitaro and the other residents followed, causing havoc in their wake. Keitaro's love was too strong for any annex's magic and he managed to break the spell, as Naru at long last declared her love for him.</p><p>Even though Naru and Keitaro were now officially a couple, things wouldn't become any easier for them. First Motoko's sister came to visit, and Motoko became aware of her own unrealized feelings for Keitaro.   Afterwards, Keitaro was shanghaied into accompanying Seta to the island of Molmol where Su attempted to make him her husband. Naru and the residents rescued Keitaro as was usual, but things were different this time. During the commotion, Keitaro's Granny Hina had sent a fax saying she would arrive at Hinata House and wanted to meet Keitaro and his fiancee. A wedding would be held and Keitaro would receive Hinata House and the surrounding property. They rushed back to Hinata House, only to find that they had lost a day due to the date line. Afraid that they had missed Keitaro's grandmother and since nothing else was going on, Naru and Keitaro decided to visit their place of dreams: Tokyo University.</p><p>So Naru and Keitaro at long last crossed the Tokyo University threshold as a couple. A gust of wind marked the momentous occasion. The moment was marred when Mutsumi arrived bearing a cell phone. It was Keitaro's grandmother. She apologized to Keitaro for not being there, but she had gone hiking in the Himalayas and lost track of time. Then something strange happened. She asked Keitaro about his promise girl, and then attempted to tell him something about said girl but all she could get out was \"b*\" before Naru grabbed the phone and disconnected it. Keitaro was aghast, but Naru was upset. SHE was Keitaro's promise girl. Wasn't she?</p><p>To console herself, she and Keitaro went to a nearby hotel. After a horribly embarrassing situation involving intended premarital relations and a giant turtle, they discovered that Nyamo Namo(the native girl from Parakelse) had been sleeping in the room. They brought her back to Hinata House and threw a party, but Naru was beginning to wonder about her and Keitaro's string of rotten luck. Eventually, Naru discovered that Nyamo had a letter for Keitaro, but was too shy to give it to him. Naru had been afraid that it was a love letter and that Keitaro had yet another suitor. The truth was far more difficult. The letter was a job offering Keitaro a position on a Parakelse research team. Naru promised Nyamo that she would give him the letter, but found herself unable to do so. As happy as she knew the offer would make him, if he accepted..... then who knew when he would be coming back?</p><p>Seeing Naru's depressed state, the Hinata House residents dragged her to a lantern festival. Naru enjoyed herself, but when she and Keitaro arrived back at Hinata House they were surprised to find the place empty. Searching revealed that each resident had written a letter saying that they had to go home for various reasons. Unable to bear the thought of being alone, Naru finally broke down and handed Keitaro the job offer. With tears in her eyes, Naru told Keitaro that she must not be his promise girl... that was the reason why fate always seemed to be conspired against them. Keitaro, as determined as ever, convinced Naru to give their relationship one more chance.</p><p>Unfortunately, their date was a disaster. Naru finally told Keitaro to follow his dreams, and ran away crying. The next day, Keitaro awoke and went to see if poor Naru had calmed down. He found her room empty, save for a note telling him that she had decided to go back home. After a quick talk with Kitsune to find out where Naru's family lived, Keitaro rushed down to the train station. He boarded the train and confronted Naru. He angrily told her that he was going to stay and see her off.</p><p>They ended up staying on the train for several loops around, and eventually dozed off. Naru dreamed she met her and Keitaro's younger selves. They asked her about their future; Naru sadly told them that things just didn't work out. However, Kei-kun told her that they seemed pretty happy to him. Naru awoke and found that she and Keitaro had rode the train all the way to the railyard. She roused Keitaro... and then something strange happened. The voice of Keitaro's grandmother rang through the train, asking Keitaro about his promise girl. Naru and Keitaro refused to listen; they managed to break out through a train window.</p><p>Naru and Keitaro ran all the way back to Hinata House, the voice of Keitaro's grandmother following them all the way. As they reached the House, they saw the shrunken form of Granny Hina atop the roof. She declared that it was time for Keitaro to learn the truth about his promise girl, but Naru screamed that she didn't want to hear it. The wizened old woman then asked them if they were really as unhappy as they seemed. More determined than he had ever been in is life, Keitaro shouted out that they weren't unhappy. As long as one of them remained happy, they would survive. He then asked Naru if she would stay with him. As the early morning sun rose Naru accepted, and then proclaimed that even if she wasn't his promise girl, she wanted to be with him. The old woman smiled as the young couple was blinded by the light of the sun.</p><p>The other residents returned to Hinata House soon after, and Keitaro and Naru went up to the roof to confront Granny Hina. As she and Kanako departed in their helicopter, she told Keitaro that his promise girl had been next to him that whole time.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>Naru and Keitaro finally get married and live happily ever after.</p>",

    "deck": "Boo Cat is a nymphomaniac werecat who is a close friend and sometimes love interest of Tarot Witch of the Black Rose. She is a resident of Salem and girlfriend of the Vampire Licorice Dust.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Boo was first transformed into a werecat when she was a young girl, on Halloween night under a full moon she was surrounded in a ceremony by the female members of her family and the Cuddly Pride. They ritualistically anointed her body with nine oils to prepare her for the change then she stood alone facing the orange autumn moon and felt the spirit of the cat. She was transformed into a black furred cat with a long tale sharp claws and orange triangle eyes, nose, and jagged mouth of a jack o lantern on her chest and belly. Boo has an orange cat paw print shaped mark on her palms that disappears when she reverts to human form. The elders said the orange markings were a special blessing due to the season. After the transformation was complete the clan washed her with a ritual cat bath and initiated her into the pride.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Boo Cat was created by <a href=\"/jim-balent/4040-19325/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-19325\">Jim Balent</a> for the series <a href=\"/tarot-witch-of-the-black-rose/4050-19691/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19691\">Tarot Witch of the Black Rose</a> and is a reoccurring character than has been in over twenty issues during the thirteen year run of the book. Jim Balent was the primary artist on <a href=\"/catwoman/4050-4955/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4955\">Catwoman</a> when it was relaunched in 1993 by DC and is credited with her modern look and appearance. Jim left DC in 1999 to launce his own company, Broadsword, with his wife <a href=\"/holly-golightly/4040-51511/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-51511\">Holly Golightly</a> who does the lettering and coloring for Boo and the other characters in the Tarot series. Jim and Holly have also worked on feline females in the Three Kittens series, also published by broadsword.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Boo first met <a href=\"/tarot/4005-48685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48685\">Tarot</a> while she was working at the exotic ‚ÄúBoo-Teek‚Äù a store that she runs herself. It was during a full moon however during the day she was in human form and very board during working hours. She spent most of her time practicing wiggling out of her panties without using her hands. When Tarot came in shopping for new and larger bras Boo was immediately attracted to her and delighted in taking the young witches exact measurements helping her select bras and watching her try them on in addition to several cosplay outfits that were also for sale at the store. Before she left Boo stole a the panties Tarot had worn in, later that night after transforming into her werecat self she used them to tract Tarot to her home, the mansion called Witches Hollow. There she found Tarot sleeping and could not resist touching her, having to hide under her bed every time she almost woke. She spent the entire night playing with the sleeping witch until morning when she reverted back to her human form and had to quickly exit before being discovered.</p><p>Tarot described Boo as her ‚Äúfirst real love and lover.‚Äù Boo was in a relationship with Tarot until two years before the events in Tarot #6 which was her first appearance. Tarot, Boo, and <a href=\"/licorice-dust/4005-52652/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52652\">Licorice</a> were in an open relationship leading to a m√©nage a trois outdoors at the lake, when Licorice tried to taste Tarot‚Äôs blood she fell under the vampires‚Äô spell and Boo had to intervene and save her. After this Tarot developed mistrust for Licorice that she never over came added to witch Boo left Tarot that night to be with Licorice with no explanation. When she returned two years later it was to enlist Tarots help saving her girlfriend life. Boo and Licorice had been picnicking in the woods when a group of men attacked them , calling them abominations conjured by the witches that had tried to burn the town on Halloween, a misinterpretation of the events in Witch Wars. The attackers stabbed Licorice with a stake through the chest, just missing her heart, before they were themselves attacked and killed by a monster Boo carried her body to the Old Salem Woods Cemetery and went to Witch Hollow to get Tarots help. While she was gone Licorice woke up and removed the stake herself when she was discovered by Skelton Man she believed him to be the man who staked her and she attacked him. Licorice almost drained Skeleton Mans blood but they were interrupted by the same ghoulish monsters that attacked the towns people in the woods, Tarot intervened just in time and Licorice and Boo were reunited.</p><p>Boo is good friends with the Aroma Witch, a human resident of Salem and she has asked him for his services to create oils and scents for her such. Once before meeting Licorice for a date at the Salem playground she asked the Aroma witch to create for her two oils one for Licorice that reminded her of Boo and one that would reflect Licorice‚Äôs own seduction back on to her to create a creepy and cuddly effect.</p><p>Boo is often hunted by townsfolk of Salem who perceive her as a threat or an abomination. She is also sought after by other werecreatures who say she a traitor for consorting with humans and vampires intimately, blasphemously polluting her bloodline. Boo was attacked by a strong werewolf while visiting her friend the aroma witch before a date with Licorice. The werewolf injured her friend and accused her of being an embarrassment; he intended to mate her to keep the bloodline pure and tried to rape her by force. Boo escaped and was able to fight off the werewolf at the edge of the woods under the full moon eventually impaling him on a sundial and throwing him down an open well.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúI will make love with any man, woman, or werebeast I choose! Such is the right of every woman! So scratch off!‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Once in an effort to get a picture of Boo and Licorice she rented an Aura Camera since the vampire would not show up on regular film, it developed with the purple haze of Licorices aura and the two spent the night making a photo album.</p><p>Boo has saved her lovers life several times. Once on a midnight date to a miniature golf course in Salem the two got so distracted after each hole that before they knew it was almost sunrise and the naked vampire and her date had to take shelter in a miniature castle. Boo transformed back to her human form but had to cover the windows of the small structure with her naked body so the sun would not shine in and kill Licorice. Boo‚Äôs body was exposed all day but they were not discovered by anyone and left to finish their date after sundown. When they were surprised by the night grounds keeper Licorice had to fly them to safety since the full moon was over and Boo was stuck in human form.</p><p>Boo has always had a physically, if not emotionally open relationship with Licorice. On a date to the Salem playground Boo arrived to find Licorice had invited three of her high school cheerleading friends, also vampires to participate. She has molested Jon Webb on several occasions, often when he is injured or unconscious and just as often in the presence of Tarot</p><p>After falling back in love with Boo after the events of The Shadow Witch, Tarot began to feel torn between her two lovers issue #40 deals specifically with Tarots fear that she will hurt either Jon or Boo. Tarot felt that after Boo left her for Licorice she could never love anyone until she met Jon, now she feels a reemergence of those feelings for Boo and is afraid she will hurt him. Boo arrives by the pool and sees Tarot on her balcony with Jon, Tarot cannot bring herself to tell Jon about her experience with Boo. Later that night while moping over Tarot Boos girlfriends Licorice Dust returns after having been gone for the last two years. Licorice does not divulge to Boo that she has been on a killing spree taking out rapist and child molesters.</p><p>Boo‚Äôs relationship with Licorice is somewhat strained at the present time. While both are very happy with each other sexually and not opposed to involving multiple partners in a strictly physical sense, Licorice is extremely jealous of anyone Boo would have an emotional or romantic relationship with. She confronting Jon and telling him to keep Tarot away from Boo then attacked Tarot in her own home, putting her under a spell and almost drinking her blood before very nearly getting staked through the heart by the witch. Licorice is also insecure with Boo‚Äôs affection, she worries that she is not getting enough of her attention but the two always reconnect if not just on a physical level.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131179/2799386-boo99.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2799386\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 441px\" data-ratio=\"1.2154195011338\" data-width=\"441\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131179/2799386-boo99.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2799386\"><img alt=\"Boo in human form\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131179/2799386-boo99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131179/2799386-boo99.jpg 441w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" data-width=\"526\"></a><figcaption>Boo in human form</figcaption></figure><p>Boo is prefers being naked even when in human form, she is naked almost every time she appears. She is a nymphomaniac, a nudist, a voyeur, and an exhibitionist; she has expressed a partiality towards occasional sadomasochism play and is in an open sexual relationship with Licorice allowing for multiple partners. Boo is bisexual but her last two relationships have been female. She has described herself as a ‚Äòpurr-v‚Äô and as ‚Äòtry-sexual‚Äô saying she will try anything once, or maybe twice</p><p>Boo keeps a diary thats pink with red hearts and a purple picture of hello kitty on the cover with Boos trademark jack o lantern design on its chest. She Drives a pink convertible and does yoga every morning, in the nude of course.</p><h2>Major Story Arc‚Äôs</h2><h3>Quest for the Black Rose Sword</h3><p>While Tarot is in limbo between life or death she is reminded that she has another love, Boo Cat and to deny her feelings for her is to deny part of herself.</p><h3>The Mists of Darkness</h3><p>While awaiting Licorice for another date at a Salem playground, Boo swings on a swing set in skyclad human form until she is transformed by the full moon and assaulted by a bald female vampire she mistook for Licorice when she heard a noise from the woods.</p><p>She is captured and turned over to the <a href=\"/war-thog/4005-52711/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52711\">war-thogs</a> who clasp her in a iron cage that fits over her torso and around her bottom with her feet and wrists in shackles. Her bottom and entire body are beaten mercilessly by the war-thogs with reeds and whips. She is marched through the night to the war camp to be turned over to azure the war elf who with the help of Raven is trying to bring about a war between the world of man and the magic world. Once the sun rises in morning Boo turns back into her human form the war-thogs are surprised by the transformation but deliver her none the less to azure‚Äôs camp. Later a letter is delivered to the Black Rose Coven declaring war on the world of man and stating Boo and Jon Webb have been taken hostage and will be killed immediately if there is any attempt by the Black Rose Witches to interfere with the invasion or rescue the prisoners.</p><p>While Tarot, Raven, and their mother fight their way towards the war camp to free Boo and Jon, Boo continues to take abuse from the war-thogs demanding she change back into her cat form. After killing one of the war-thogs by singing her teeth into its neck Jon arrives to rescue the blood covered naked girl (still in pink heals) While Boo explains their predicament to Jon she proceeds to clean the blood from herself, cat style.</p><p>Later once Tarot, Raven, and their mother have been taken prisoner by Azure an army of ghosts show up lead by Skeleton Man, Crypt Chick, and Boo Cat. Boo is still in human form but sporting a skeleton ribcage top and skull bottoms with arm length black and white skeleton gloves and cat ear headband. Boo leads an assault against the war-thogs savagely killing many of them until the battle is won.</p><h3>Hawaiian Holiday</h3><p>After the events of The Mists of Darkness Boo Cat and Licorice went with Tarot, Raven, their mother and Jon to <a href=\"/hawaii/4020-56180/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56180\">Hawaii</a> to vacation and recover. Boo drank heavily and Licorice could hardly keep up with, Boo was very frisky in Hawaii. She jumped up on stage during a luau and groped some of the hula dancers off their grass skirts and coconut tops. Boo exposed herself to the crowd, and embarrassed a male fire dancer by pulling down his loin-cloth and exposing him to the crowd during his performance. Licorice had to carry the intoxicated werecat off stage, throw her over her shoulder and run away from the angry mob, Boo eventually passed out and Licorice left her naked on a chair by the pool to teach her a lesson.</p><h3>The Shadow Witch</h3><p>After Tarots second battle with Azure Boo Cat took care of her and nursed her back to help while she laid in bed for six weeks at Witch Hollow recovering from the removal of the tumor Azure had infected her with. Boo comforted Tarot as she faced the reality that she would never be able to have children after the injuries Azure inflicted on her. Boo told her it was not the amount of children she gave birth to but the love that she gave to others. Tarot discovered a new level of intimacy with Boo in the way she helped her do everything during her recovery, she started to develop a strong attraction towards her aided by Boo‚Äôs constant teasing. After six weeks of being cared for by Boo day and night Tarot and her gave into their physical desires.</p><h3>So Mote it be</h3><p>Boo wakes up in Tarots bedroom at Withes Hollow and tries to get her to stay in her room with her and play all day but Tarot has to respond to Thornwich who is threatening a Salem child in defense of a injured fairy. When she returns injured Boo, now in cat form, helps her heal but later that night when a battle breaks out between Thornwick and Tarot, Boo runs away knowing she is outmatched by their powers and brings back Skeleton Man who helps Tarot put Thornwick down. Unfortunately for Boo while Jon and Tarot are celebrating in the garden her plans to join in are foiled by Raven Hex who casts a spell on making her unable to move.</p><h3>Powers and Abilities</h3><p>Boo is a human female and shapeshifter who is transformed into a werecat when exposed to a full moon but is reverted back to human form at sunrise. When in cat form she has catlike senses, longer and sharper fingernails and sharp canine teeth capable of tearing flesh. She has excellent balance and reflexes she is able to jump to and from heights without injury but has a fear of flying or very tall heights outside the bounds of her reach. Boo Cat can hasten the speed at which she or someone else heals by licking their wounds. She, like all shapeshifters, is venerable to wolfsbane, when it is in its power form it can be thrown on or at her and will effectively repel her not unlike garlic for a vampire.</p><p>Boo is often distracted in combat, usually by something sexual. When Pooka, Tarots goblin cat familiar, became sick from haunted hairballs Boo defended her friend and helped her rid Witch Hollow of the hairballs and get Pooka back to normal. Even thought fighting for her life Boo was often distracted by Tarots nudity or her own remarking to herself that one day her sex drive will be the death of her. Again when the six were being tormented by frost fairies in the snow around Witches Hollow Boo is the only one smiling the entire time when the pixies take everyone‚Äôs clothes and they go sledding down a snow covered hill naked.</p><h2>Teams</h2><p>Boo‚Äôs family and clan are only mentioned one time during her origin story in Tarot #12 but she is a member of a were cat pack called The Cuddly Pride. Although not a member of the Black Rose Coven she is often found fighting evil in its company alongside Rave Hex, Tarot, their mother, and Jon Webb also know as Skeleton Man the guardian of the forgotten and haunted cemetery of Salem Woods.</p>",

Wilkins was in fact much older than he seemed and really started Sunnydale during the 1800s. Wilkins was there because he had found the Hellmouth and there he found the many many evil demons under it. After making a pact with the demons he gave up his soul but then gained immortality and longevity (although he could still be killed). For years he would say that he was Richard Wilkins the second and the first so people would think he was just his own son and not immortal.¬†<div><br/></div><div>Despite being a evil person Richard was a very cheery person who didn't even use curse words and was a very clean person who talked people down when they didn't wash their hands enough.He had a wife in 1903 but as to be expected she did not stay young while he did. In her old age she began to suffer from¬†senility¬†and because of it she began to hate Richard because he would not age but she would and then die.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/249094-85129-scooby-gang.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249094\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/249094-85129-scooby-gang.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249094\"><img alt=\"Buffy and the Scoobies\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/249094-85129-scooby-gang.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/249094-85129-scooby-gang.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Buffy and the Scoobies</figcaption></figure>Later <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20096\" href=\"/buffy/4005-20096/\" slug=\"buffy\">Buffy Summers</a> would be chosen as the vampire slayer and became active in Sunnydale.

After Faith who had become increasingly unstable killed his assistant mayor and then the vampire Trick she joined his scheme. He would also sit back and watch as the dangers Buffy got in almost killed her and sometimes try to make them worse.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/142049-104610-faith.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-142049\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0416666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/142049-104610-faith.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-142049\"><img alt=\"Big bad Slayer\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" data-width=\"192\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/142049-104610-faith.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/142049-104610-faith.jpg 192w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Big bad Slayer\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/142049-104610-faith.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/142049-104610-faith.jpg 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" data-width=\"192\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Big bad Slayer</figcaption></figure>Later Richard got possession of a box that was necessary for his plan. It was revealed that his goal is to ascend into a Old One called Olvikan a powerful demon. He ate a number of spiders that where in the box and that was the start of the ritual. It gave him invulnerability and along with his immortality ¬†he would not be stopped by Buffy, but there was a bright side. The invulnerability would only last for a hundred days but this wasn't so bright because at the end of that time he would Ascend into Olvikan.¬†</div><div><br/></div><div>However his relationship was Faith was not just that of employee employer but he loved her like his own daughter something he never had. He even got her a new home out of the old motel she was in and a new knife. After Faith poisoned Angel Buffy fought her and stabbed her in the stomach with her own knife. This caused her to go into a coma and he wanted to kill Buffy worse than before. Soon at Buffy's highschool graduation the Mayor ascended.</div><div><br/></div><div>He transformed in the middle of the award¬†ceremony¬†and started to attack the people there( even killing the school principal who had been trouble for Buffy from the¬†beginning). However Buffy was ready and had turned the school population into an army against the Mayor and the army of vampires that he had fighting him due to an eclipse apart of the ritual. Buffy was able to get the Mayor's attention by showing him the knife she used on Faith and he followed her into the school. She got him to the library where she had wired with explosives and he was blown up by the incredible force.</div><div><br/></div><div>After some time however the Mayor began to exist as a ghost and over time began to ruin Buffy's life again. He existed in the body of animals demons and vampires and was even responsible for the damage done to Adam when he was human. Finally however Buffy made he Mayor move on but she didn't even know that it was his ghost she was fighting.</div><div><br/></div><div><h2>Powers</h2></div><div><br/></div><div>The Mayor was very skilled in magic and dark arts and have many magical items in his possession. He had been given eternal life by demons hundreds of years ago but he could still be killed. However once he performed a ritual to start his transformation into Olvikan he was now unable to be killed and this would last for a 100 days until he changed into Olvikan and once that happened he gained the beings large snake like body and size, meaning he had the beasts strength fangs and durability bt the downside was he was no longer protected the the spells and even though unlikely he could be killed. After becoming a ghost he could take over the bodies of any being he chose but eventually he lost this power when he moved on.</div>",

He has been one of the more active of the siblings and his job was to find potential <a href=\"/hellspawn/4060-49039/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49039\">Hellspawn</a> within the bowels of <a href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">Hell</a>. It was during one of these scouting missions that he tested child murderer <a href=\"/billy-kincaid/4005-10521/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10521\">Billy Kincaid</a>. Vindicator is also the most sarcastic and humorous of the brothers.

Eventually they are picked off one by one leaving Billy and a little girl. It is revealed the little girl is Vindicator in disguise. Vindicator gives Billy a tour of hell(against Billy's will). Vindicator shows him the different realms of hell and brings him to his home, the Eighth Sphere. He gives Billy a symbiotic suite(much like the one Spawn wears) and tells him to meet his new boss Malebolgia.</p><p>Violator</p><p>Vindicator and his brothers are deciding what they are to do with their brother, Violator. They eventually agree they have to kill him. Once they found Violator they were attacked by Admonisher(a man hired by the mafia to hunt Violator). Vindicator runs up to Admonisher and gets his brain shot out of his head. They continue to fight Admonisher until they retreat into a portal that Vindicator created, while chasing a man they believe to be Violator into the portal to hell.</p><h2><b>Alternate Versions</b></h2><h3><b>Spawn/WildCATs</b></h3><p>Vindicator and the rest of his brothers are the New York police force in the year 2015 where Spawn rules the Earth.</p>",

    "deck": "She is an excellent swordsman from the God's Cry School in Kyoto. She lives at the Hinata House girls dorm.",
    "description": "<a href=\"/\"></a><h2>About Motoko</h2><p>Motoko Aoyama comes from a famous line of swordsmen from Kyoto. Her family are the proprietors of the God's Cry School. Growing up, Motoko was always in awe of her older sister, Tsuruko. One day, Motoko caught her sister and her fiancee in the intimate act of kissing. This had a profound affect on her; causing her hatred and fear of both turtles and men. Shortly after this, Motoko left Kyoto to stay at the Hinata House girls dorm. She was the last resident to arrive before Keitaro came.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>At Hinata House</h2><p>Motoko is perhaps the one character who undergoes the most growth during Love Hina(even more so than Keitaro). When the series begins, she is very formal and dedicated to her swordcraft. She has a hatred of men, especially men she considers to be perverted or weak(like Keitaro). The first hint that there may be more to her than there appears, comes at the end of the first volume. She begins feeling weak and feverish, and is afraid that she's falling in love with Keitaro. It turns out that she is just suffering from a cold.</p><p>As much as Motoko insults Keitaro for being unmasculine; she herself is insecure about her femininity. She once challenged Keitaro to a duel, and when he somehow won his prize for winning was to ask Motoko to act more like a woman and less like a warrior. The other residents helped her out by giving her a makeover and putting her in a miniskirt. Motoko even tries her hand at stereotypical chores like cooking and cleaning. Unfortunately, this makes her feel helpless and miserable. Keitaro apologizes for hurting her feelings, and she challenges him to a rematch which she wins easily. She refuses to punish him though, and says that if there is a woman who is unfeminine, then she must be balanced by a man who is unmasculine.</p><p>When the gang goes traveling, Motoko is usually paired with Kitsune. She and Kitsune are somewhat of an \"odd couple\"; the free spirit lustful gambler, and the stoic and formal swordswoman. They first go traveling to search for Shinobu and Su who themselves have gone in search of Keitaro and Naru. Motoko soon discovers that Kitsune's real motive appears to be eating lots of local delicacies. They run out of money, and Motoko is forced to perform swordtricks for passerby to earn yen. They finally catch up with Shinobu and Su, and manage to rescue them from some yakuza. They eventually track Keitaro and Naru down, and they all head back to Hinata House.</p> <p>Much the same thing happens when they travel to the island of Parakelse. Motoko and Kitsune, this time joined by Mutsumi have come to the island searching for Puffy Mushroom(Shinobu, Su, and Sarah) who were lost looking for Keitaro and Naru. This time, Kitsune dresses Motoko in a leaf bikini in order to hitch a ride, but ends up causing a major traffic accident.</p><p>Motoko is the only one at Hinata House who has the stamina to keep up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49029\" href=\"/kaolla-su/4005-49029/\">Kaolla Su</a>. Su seems to have somewhat romantic intentions on Motoko, though with Su's personality it can be hard to tell when she's playing and when she is serious. Once, Shinobu was interested in learning about kissing so Su created a special kiss training companion named Krishna-chan. Krishna-chan ran amok, and wound up running into poor Motoko and kissing her. Motoko is horrified, and Su deduces that the machine must have been her first kiss. To make it up to her, Su gives her another kiss and then gushes that Motoko was her first. She then embarrasses Motoko further by saying that she tasted like soy sauce. Later, when Su kidnaps Keitaro on the island of Molmol she tells him that she wants to take Motoko as a lover/bodyguard.</p><p>Motoko's complicated relationship with her sister is first explored in vol.9 when Tsuruko comes to Hinata House and tells Motoko that it's time for her to take over the family's dojo. Motoko doesn't want to, so she fakes an engagement to Keitaro(according to family tradition if a daughter wed she was not able to take over the school). Tsuruko later discovers the truth, and she defeats Motoko in a duel. She forces Motoko to live as a normal high school student until she able to defeat her. If after three days, she still can't defeat her, Tsuruko will actually force her to marry Keitaro. Tsuruko secretly tells Keitaro that she wants him to help Motoko defeat her. She tells him about Motoko walking in on her and her husband, and that defeating her will be the only way Motoko will become whole. With Keitaro's help, Motoko finally defeats her sister. Tsuruko is secretly pleased.</p><p>As much hell as Motoko put Keitaro through for being a ronin, the tables are turned when she also fails the Tokyo University entrance exam. To make matters worse, she pulls a Keitaro and tels her family that she made it in. Tsuruko comes to Hinata House to congratulate her, and when the truth comes out that she failed and has spent her spare time writing tawdry romance stories, she fights Motoko and calls her pathetic. Motoko realizes that her sister is right, and announces her intention to leave Hinata House and become a nun.</p><p>She cuts her hair and leaves Hinata House. Keitaro follows her and convinces her to let him help her study. He gives her an old mechanical pencil of his for luck. Keitaro ends up dozing off while they study, and Motoko reminisces about her past dealings with Tsuruko and Keitaro. She comes to the conclusion that she thinks too much, and then pretends everything's okay by hiding her weaknesses. Tsuruko gets the jump on her with a surprise attack, but Motoko manages to win by blocking the Tsuruko's sword with the lucky pencil. Motoko refuses to deny her feelings any longer, and announces her love for Keitaro. Satisfied, Tsuruko leaves her be.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>By Love Hina's epilogue, Motoko has become a third year law student at Tokyo U, proprietor of the God's Cry School in Kyoto, and also a successful part-time romance novelist.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>About Shinobu</h2><p>Calling Shinobu neurotic would be an understatement. She has a habit of breaking into tears and running anytime somebody looks at her the wrong way. She is very shy and nervous, but also very willing to help. What she lacks in willpower, she makes up for in kindness.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>At Hinata House</h2><p>Shinobu is the youngest of the original Hinata House residents. She is not shown to be particularly close to any of them, though she sometimes pals around with the two girls closest to her in age; Su and Sarah. Shinobu and Su form a rescue mission to \"save\" Keitaro after he failed his exams and took a vacation; and later the trio formed a group called \"Puffy Mushroom\" to find Keitaro after he was stranded on the island of Parakelse.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, the person Shinobu feels closest to at Hinata House is Keitaro. When everyone is under the impression that Keitaro is a Tokyo U student, he helps give Shinobu confidence with her schoolwork. Unfortunately, she is crushed when the truth comes out that he's actually a second year ronin. Keitaro manages to repair the trust between them, and Shinobu starts to develop a crush on him. Later, Keitaro agrees to tutor Shinobu, and ends up taking her on a \"date\" to bolster her spirits after she failed an exam. Shinobu eventually comes to realize that Keitaro is happiest when he's with Naru, and cheers them both on.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>By the end of Love Hina, Shinobu has outgrown most of her shyness and resembles Naru a great deal. She has accomplished her dream of getting into Tokyo University.</p>",

    "deck": "Mutsumi is a very frail student who has failed to get into Tokyo University three years in a row. She loves watermelons, dried squid, and heated tables.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>About Mutsumi</h2><p>Mutsumi is a clumsy oaf of a girl without a lick of common sense(though perhaps more than she lets on). She is constantly having near death experiences and always carries her last will and testament with her in case she should actually kick the bucket. Her favorite things in life are watermelons, dried squid, kotatsu, kissing, and turtles. Much like some other Love Hina characters she is desperately trying to get into <a data-ref-id=\"4020-49799\" href=\"/tokyo-university/4020-49799/\" slug=\"tokyo-university\">Tokyo University</a> due to a promise she had made when she was younger. Despite suffering from bad luck, she always maintains a bright and cheerful attitude.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>A Brief History of Mutsumi</h2><p>Mutsumi's mother was an employee at the Hinata Inn, which is where the young Mutsumi met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49028\" href=\"/keitaro-urashima/4005-49028/\" slug=\"keitaro-urashima\">Keitaro Urashima</a> and a sickly girl named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49030\" href=\"/naru-narusegawa/4005-49030/\" slug=\"naru-narusegawa\">Naru Narusegawa</a> for the first time. The trio played together, and Mutsumi was the first to hear the fairy tale that if two people who love each other very much go to Tokyo University, they'll be together forever. Mutsumi knew the younger and shyer Naru liked Keitaro, so she gave her the confidence to make a promise with him that they would both go to Tokyo U. Keitaro left sometime later, and knowing that Naru was too young to remember her promise, Mutsumi remade the promise with her.</p><p>Time passed, and the trio would eventually forget most of their time at Hinata House. Keitaro and Mutsumi would remember making promises(something that would be a driving force in their lives), though not to who; while Naru, who was little more than a toddler, grew up and remembered nothing.</p><p>The trio wouldn't meet again until, having failed her Tokyo University entrance exam, Mutsumi embarked on a \"journey of self-discovery\". She running into Keitaro and Naru(though she didn't recognize them, nor vice versa). They eventually decided to travel together, and Mutsumi revealed that she was trying to get into Tokyo U due to a childhood promise. Naru recognized the similarities between Mutsumi's and Keitaro's stories, but thought little of it. As a parting gift at the end of their trip, Mutsumi gave Keitaro and Naru a flying hot springs turtle named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49091\" href=\"/tama-chan/4005-49091/\" slug=\"tama-chan\">Tama-chan</a> to keep as a pet.</p><p>Some time later, Mutsumi came to the Hinata area to stay while she studied for the next entrance exams. She rejoined Keitaro and Naru and they formed ronin study group. It was during this time that Naru found a photograph of the three of them at Hinata House as a children. This led her to the conclusion that Mutsumi and Keitaro had made their promises to each other. Naru had grown quite fond of Keitaro, and debated whether she should tell them that they were seemingly destined for each other. She finally broke down and revealed the truth to them on the night of Christmas Eve. However, Mutsumi(not the \"sharpest knife in the drawer\") failed to comprehend what Naru was saying, even though Keitaro did. Even worse, Mutsumi had also grown quite fond of Keitaro. Aaand to complicate matters further, the house Mutsumi was staying in burned down, forcing her work with Keitaro's aunt Haruka and to stay at Hinata House temporarily.</p> <p>Things stayed somewhat bumpy between the three of them, until Naru woke up one morning and found Mutsumi in Keitaro's bed. Naru was furious, and Mutsumi made matters worse by inadvertently insinuating she was pregnant. Common sense won the day however, when Haruka revealed that Musumi was a chronic sleepwalker. As the trio made up and walked home through the cherry blossoms, Mutsumi had a revelation. She now remembered the person with whom she made her promise, but she wanted to keep it to herself until after the exams.</p><p>On the day of the fateful exams, Keitaro and Naru met up with Mutsumi. Keitaro apologized to Mutsumi that he wouldn't be able to keep his promise to her, but he was in love with Naru now. To the shock of the other two, Mutsumi told Keitaro that he was mistaken. Mutsumi had made HER promise with a girl... Naru. She attempted to explain to Keitaro that the girl he made his promise to was his first love, but she was too young to remember. The bell rang before she could explain any further.</p><p>Mutsumi finally made it into Tokyo U after that, and she was part of the crew that went to rescue Naru and Keitaro on the island of Parakelse. Later, Mutsumi, Keitaro, and Naru visited Mutsumi's home in Okinawa where more history of the promise was revealed.</p><p>After this, Mutsumi plays a much smaller role in Love Hina. After Keitaro's adopted sister, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49277\" href=\"/kanako-urashima/4005-49277/\" slug=\"kanako-urashima\">Kanako Urashima</a>, turned Hinata House back into an inn, Mutsumi got to pretend to be Keitaro so the other residents could practice their service techniques. She and Naru were the only residents to take Kanako's side during the Hinata Liberation Wars. Later, Mutsumi and Kitsune stowed away on Naru's \"Emotional Healing Journey\", though this was more an attempt to eat different kinds of food.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>By Love Hina's finale, Mutsumi has become a graduate student and is still attending Tokyo University.</p>",

With her eyes closed, she resembles a fox and she is also very cunning.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>By the end of Love Hina, Kitsune has moved out of Hinata House and taken over Haruka's old job at the cafe.</p>",

    "description": "<p> </p><h2>Synopsis</h2><br/><br/>In the not-too-distant future, Shinjuku,Tokyo is under siege by strange¬†demons-turned-machines¬† led by a sinister ex-hero named Eko. Though the future looks bleak, all is not lost. There is a young hero chosen by the Landlord Yurine to fight against the phantoms that plague Japan. He is KARAS, a powerful armored being appointed to defend the innocent. With the help of Yurine, his mystical mentor, Karas sets out to preserve the natural balance of the universe, and to prevent the friendly old-world monsters from being transformed into mechanical demons!¬†¬†A man by the name of Otaha¬†a former Yakuza clansman living in¬†Shinjuku (less distant future)¬†populated only by humans and Yokai (spritis/oni¬†based¬†on japanese mythology).¬†¬†A secret war is raging between the renegade¬†ex-karas warrior¬†Eko and a spectral warrior known as the Karas. Eko has mechanized himself and his followers to defend against the unearthly fury of the Karas; in addition to an armored humanoid form, the Karas can transform into any of various heavily armed and armored vehicles. Eko and his followers prefer to live in the material realm in human form, but to continue doing so they must feed on the fluids of human bodies. Their periodic feasts result in massacres that leave only a single traumatized survivor; these \"inexplicable\" tragedies are the obsession of a marginalized police inspector whose daughter was the survivor of one such massacre. Opposing Eko are the renegade demon Nue, who also lives in the material world in human form but refuses to drink blood or take a mechanized form, and Otoha, a former human who is summoned by the mysterious Yurine to become the new Karas.¬†¬†Otoha the recent Raven Karas is trying to seek great vengeance against the yakuza clansman that¬†¬†slaugtered his brother and nearly killed him as well protect the city from the evil forces of eko and his minions.<br/><br/> <h2>Karas¬†¬† </h2><strong><br/></strong><br/>Karas are¬†\"heard\" ¬†by Yurine, the physical embodiment of hope in different cities of japan chose karas by people who are on or near the verge of death and who know extreme sorrow. That person are then transported to the spiritual world where they are given a \"item\" that gives them the information about yurine, karas's duties, the place that he is in now, ect. The raven karas, neither human nor mystical¬†entity is set to protect the cities of japan from <em>mikura,</em> mechanized<em> </em>demons, bent on draining the blood of humans¬†¬†and posssibly beyond, in hopes that Eko may be able¬†to take over the cities. There are different Karas warriors in different cities by different yurines.¬† In order to fight and (out)match mikura, they have combined their spirit vanquishing magics with \"Technology\" in order to fight mikura.¬†¬† Different Karas represent different paths for the good of the¬†city. <br/> <p> </p><h2>Powers</h2> The suit in which the user's sole is transported into has many vast capabilities in order to combat mikura or even rouge Karas' such as Eko. When using the armor, the wearer is granted vast speed, agility,¬† strength, durability, and enhanced senses. The armor is polymorphic and can take on two additional forms: a Jet and a Car, both of these are fitted with offensive arsenal that a traditional aerial or ground combat¬† vehicle commonly have such as missles or turrets that fire bolts of energy . The artilliery refined into the bipedal armor include explosive shruikens and a katana that can be mentally controlled to move when not in the users grasp. The armor also conceals a versatile chain used in situations like guiding karas through turns when traversing at high speeds. Unbeknownst to humans, when a fight occurs between a Karas and his or hers opponent they are rendered invisible to be concealed from human awareness. Karas can also tap into an alternate power, a \"rage mode\" if you will, that further increases all of the user's abilities. <br/> <h2>Yurine</h2><br/>Yurine are the physical/spiritual manifestations of hope within a city, each Yurine represents a different city. Different Yurines are¬†observed on what color hair they have and what clothing they wear. A Yurine, although powerful is vulnerable, such as when Tsuchigumo kidnapped Yurine and Otoha transformed back into a human, this shows that a Yurine has much jurisdiction over whether or not a karas can transform or access his/her full potential, as when another karas tried to unsheath her sword and failed. A Yurine can also shapeshift into a cat, usually for the purpose of observing potential karas warriors.<br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21688/468911-yurine.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-468911\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21688/468911-yurine.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-468911\"><img alt=\"White haired Yurine\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21688/468911-yurine.png\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21688/468911-yurine.png 704w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21688/468911-yurine.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>White haired Yurine</figcaption></figure> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21688/468910-2hqcygp.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-468910\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21688/468910-2hqcygp.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-468910\"><img alt=\"Pink haired Yurine\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21688/468910-2hqcygp.png\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21688/468910-2hqcygp.png 640w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21688/468910-2hqcygp.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Pink haired Yurine</figcaption></figure><br/> <p><br/>¬†</p>",

    "deck": "Nolan Grayson's second son, Oliver, was born on a distant planet to another mother. Inheriting his father's abilities he is the half-brother of Invincible and known as the superhero Kid-Omni Man.",
    "description": "<p> </p><h2>Origin</h2><p>After <a href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\"> Omni-man</a> (Nolan Grayson), <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\"> Invincible</a>'s father was revealed to have killed the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\"> Guardians of the Globe</a>, he left the planet for deep space. Some time later his son had discovered his father on an alien planet (where the insect like locals age faster than humans, their average life span being about nine months) with a new wife and child. The planet is soon attacked by <a href=\"/viltrumites/4060-54662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54662\"> Viltrumites</a>, and Invincible and Nolan are forced to fight the Viltrumites. Nolan is captured by the Viltrumites after the battle is over. The Viltrumtes give Invincible his father's mission of taking over Earth and give him a hundred years to do it. the boy's mother Andressa told Mark to take his brother back to Earth as she wants to stay behind and rebuild her planet with her people. When Mark returns his mother is happy to take care of the boy and names him Oliver. Due to Oliver's insect DNA he ages faster than Nolan and has begun to show powers like his father.</p><h3><b>Life On Earth</b></h3><p>When Mark returned his little brother to earth, things began to happen rather quickly. Young Oliver is given a legal ID and a tutor who is skilled enough to handle his accelerated learning. As he got older, his brother began to train him. And, when he was old enough, his brother got him a real costume.</p><p>After the costume, Kid Omni-Man found it hard to restrain himself. Even when Invincible told his brother to hold back, Kid Omni-Man usually ran head first into the fight. His early attempts in battle went pretty roughly, but that didn't quench his eagerness to be in the fights.</p><p>When Invincible flew off to fight the <a href=\"/mauler-twins/4005-41202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41202\"> Mauler Twins</a> as they attempted to take over a nuclear facility, Oliver tagged along. Invincible tried to get him to leave, but the missiles within the facility where launched, and Invincible had to go after them. In his absence, Kid Omni-Man violently killed both of them, swearing later that it was an accident.</p><p>But was it? Oliver has shown several times over that he feels very little sympathy for the human condition. He has openly voiced that he doesn't not consider humans to be \"his people\", and that he hates almost all of them. His super-developed ability to learn has out-stripped the development of his morals, giving him all the knowledge he needs to rationalize his actions and none of the morality to truly decide what is right and what is wrong.</p><p>Kid Omni-man's most recent adventure took place as his brother pre-occupied himself with personal issues. While Mark was away, Oliver donned his costume and went off to face one of Invincible's villains. Though the confrontation wasn't really a fight (the guy needed help from someone strong to help him get out of his suit of armor), there was allot of property damage, and Invincible was angry when he found out.</p><p>The story of Kid Omni-Man is still very young, and young Oliver can go to either side. And he may even grow to be more powerful than his brother. Only time will tell.</p><p> </p><p>When Conquest arrives on Earth, Oliver tries to help Mark fight off Conquest, but is toss aside by Invincible so he doesn't get hurt. Oliver comes back and kicks Conquest in the face, but Conquest gets up and hits him in the face and dislocates his arm and proceeds on to kill him, only to be stopped by Invincible. After the Conquest battle, Mark and Oliver are seen in an hospital talking about what has happened. Mark then admits that the only way to get rid of badguys is to kill them.</p><p> </p><p>We later see Oliver with a new costume and a new name, now calling himself Young Omni-Man. After his father came back to earth, recuting Invincible and tech Jacket, Oliver wanted to go with them, but refused saying that he was needed on earth. But Nolan told Oliver that he should come, because they have a lot of catching up to do. In space they are attacked by Conquest and 2 other viltrumites. As the fight, Oliver loses oxygen and is forced to go to a close planet to regain his breath.</p><p> </p><p>Conquest follows Oliver, but he is struck down by Mark. Later on, both Nolan and Oliver find a near death Invincible after his battle with Conquest, killing Conquest once and for all. A couple of months pass until Mark finally recover from his wounds and the 3 of them head out to help the others.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/1561036-escanear0015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1561036\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.78485092667204\" data-width=\"1241\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/1561036-escanear0015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1561036\"><img alt=\" Oliver dead?\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/58664/1561036-escanear0015.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/1561036-escanear0015.jpg 1241w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/58664/1561036-escanear0015.jpg 960w, https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/58664/1561036-escanear0015.jpg 480w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/58664/1561036-escanear0015.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Oliver dead?</figcaption></figure><p>After some time evryone head to space to fight the remaining viltrumites and Oliver is seemingly killed by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/grand-regent-thragg/4005-72505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72505\">Thragg</a>. It is later revealed that Oliver is indeed alive and its recovering. He was left to recover.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Death</h2><p>Oliver, while working as a double agent for <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/allen/4005-40950/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40950\">Allen</a> in gaining Thragg's trust, was ordered by Thragg to not interfere in his assault on Mark's family to prove his loyalty to the Viltrumite cause. Oliver disobeys Thragg's orders and attacks Thragg to protect his niece, <a href=\"/terra-grayson/4005-115483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-115483\">Terra Grayson</a>. During their skirmish, Oliver angers Thragg after reminding him of his jealousy that he will never be as good as a ruler in comparison to Oliver's Argall related bloodline. This leads to Thragg punching a hole through Oliver's chest, instantly killing him while a shocked Terra asks Thragg whether her uncle was killed by Thragg in disbelief.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Due to Oliver's hybrid alien DNA he ages faster than a Viltrumite, but Nolan believed that as he matured his Viltrumite powers would awaken and he would age slower. This has proven true as Oliver has demonstrated flight, strength and invulnerability. He also seems to have stayed in his teenage years. Oliver also has the powers of his race, which give him a perfect memory of everything he's ever seen or heard going all the way back to birth.</p>",

    "description": "<p>By the year 2462 Animal is a legend at bringing in the criminal element.  He does this by obeying his orders from his handler completely.  He is more of an attack dog than a thinking man.<br/></p><p>When Booster Gold comes back to this time the Animal is used to track him and Goldstar down.  He puts up a good fight but is stopped when the boat he is on explodes and he sinks to the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>Goldstar blew up the boat on accident when she ruptured the fuel tanks.  Unwilling to let animal drown she pulls him back to the surface with her magnetic powers.  This action causes her and Booster to be captured but Animal is spared.</p><p>Later Booster and Goldstar escape custody and the Animal is called again.  Animal starts making short work of Booster until his Handler Broderick tries to shoot Goldstar.  Animal remembers when Goldstar saved his life and he returns the favor by turning on his handler.  This causes Broderick's shot to go off target and sever a cable that was needed to get Booster and Goldstar back to the past.  Booster decides to sacrifice himself to save everyone else.  He is going to hold the cables together so the time platform will work.  Animal realizes this and throws Booster onto the platform and holds the cables together himself.  Broderick in an attempt to stop their time travel shoots Animal in the back, but it is too late.  The time platform worked.</p><p>When Goldstar gets back to her time she is horrified and wishes things could be different for Animal.  she wishes she could thank Animal for his sacrifice.</p>",

Solomon is the first of the Monitors who emerged in the creation of the 52 Multiverse who developed individuality from the almost hive like mindset of the other Monitors and self-adopted the name of Solomon as an indication of his great wisdom to the other Monitors.</p><p>It is unrevealed when Solomon decided to go against his brother and sister Monitors. But he was the first to decide an agressive plan of universal containment by finding and eliminating any and all known extra-dimensional travellers. Solomon was able to convince most of his brethen to support him in this manner or at least allow him a free hand and not be directly opposed to his plan including the seemingly opposing Bob of New Earth. Bob later rejected Solomon's extreme attitude to \"dimension hoppers\" except in cases where these dimension hoppers posed an open threat to the multiverse such as the Monarch.</p><p>Solomon's plan of individual universal containment was ultimately revealed not to be a protection device for each individual reality, but a long-term self advancement plan similar to the Anti-Monitor. His plan was designed to increase his own personal power and allow him to become more powerful than any other individual Monitors referred to the others as Prime Monitor which one of the female Monitors states is a myth. When Bob confronted Solomon on the matter, Solomon revealed this plan and attempted to directly absorb Bob and Bob's powers into himself. Unable to take Bob's powers for himself, Solomon killed Bob.</p><p>While the other Monitors were repulsed that Solomon would kill one of their own, they supported Solomon in the recent Monarch War. After the war, fearing that Solomon may resume his attempt to take their powers for his own and control them, the other Monitors banished Solomon from their ranks for his attempt at domination over them. It was then revealed that Solomon had been playing against Darkseid this entire time, both striving for control of the Multiverse.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/649354-uxas_vs_the_monitors.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-649354\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.0170648464164\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/649354-uxas_vs_the_monitors.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-649354\"><img alt=\"They play for the future.\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/649354-uxas_vs_the_monitors.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/649354-uxas_vs_the_monitors.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px\" data-width=\"293\"></a><figcaption>They play for the future.</figcaption></figure><p>Solomon is planning to resume his attempt to control the other Monitors but is merely maintaining his vigil of the Earth-8 dimension for the time being.

    "deck": "The last Monitor of the Multiverse, Nix has evolved into a new role as the Judge of All Evil.",
    "description": "<p>After the creation of the <a href=\"/the-dc-multiverse/4015-43603/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43603\"> new multiverse </a>in <a href=\"/52/4050-18053/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18053\"> 52</a>, a new race of 52 different <a href=\"/the-monitors/4060-48220/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48220\"> Monitors </a>is seen to be active trying to protect the multiverse from corruption as a community. Each monitor is assigned to its own world, and they all vary at least slightly in appearance. A version of the <a href=\"/anti-monitor/4005-12165/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12165\"> Anti-Monitor </a>is also seen to be active helping the <a href=\"/sinestro-corps/4060-42352/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42352\"> Sinestro Corps </a>on <a href=\"/qward/4020-41619/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41619\"> Qward</a>. Although they are seen again, the Monitors are seen to play their next biggest role during the events leading up to <a href=\"/final-crisis/4045-51642/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-51642\"> Final Crisis</a>.</p><p>Multiversal Monitor Nix Uotan was one of the most dedicated and successful of the Monitors, having groomed his charged universe, \" Earth-51,\" to a state of near perfection. When <a href=\"/ray-palmer/4005-34685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34685\"> Ray Palmer </a>of New Earth arrived seeking sanctuary, Uotan welcomed him and hid his presence from the other Monitors. For a time things continued as normal, and Palmer's presence proved to hold little effect on the events of his world.</p><p>Unfortunately however, The Challengers of the Beyond's search for Ray Palmer led them through the Multiverse, and finally to Earth-51. With them came <a href=\"/monarch/4005-12940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12940\"> Monarch</a>, who decided to make Earth-51 the first stop in his conquest of the Multiverse. Nix was horrified when his Earth became the site for the gigantic showdown battle between the Monitors, and Monarch and his armies. Though the Moniter's rallied to face the threat, they were unable to stop Monarch. Their time apart had tainted them, and they were unable to work together, making them easy targets for Monarch's forces to dispatch. The denizens of Earth-51, who had been enjoying years of peace for quite some time since they had won there battle of Good vs Evil where unprepared to face the threat as it arrived.</p><p>When the Monitor <a href=\"/solomon/4005-49069/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49069\"> Solomon </a>is confronted on the <a href=\"/monitors-satellite/4020-56079/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56079\"> Monitor's home world </a>by <a href=\"/superman-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\"> Superman-Prime</a>, he sends him off to Earth-51 as well as a way to both save himself and hopefully ensure the defeat of Monarch. Prime arrives just as Monarch is ready to claim victory against the forces of the Monitors. Prime launches himself at Monarch in a rage, and in the resulting battle is responsible for the destruction of the very planet he had come to save. As they fight Monarch reveals that Prime is beginning to run low on the borrowed power he stole form the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\"> Guardian</a> during the events of the end of <a href=\"/sinestro-corps-war/4045-50650/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-50650\"> Sinestro Corps War</a>, and he will soon revert to the body of a boy. Prime is surprise to find that Monarch is able to hurt him, and becomes desperate. Nix watches on, and realizing that what he can do for his earth at this point is limited, offers his services to the Challengers in reaching <a href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\"> Apokolips</a>.</p><p>With the exception of a single plant, his entire universe was destroyed when Superman-Prime ruptured Monarch's containment suit and unleashed his energies. Uotan was later given charge of another Earth, but it quickly was infected by the <a href=\"/morticoccus-virus/4055-53085/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-53085\"> Morticoccus Virus </a>within the <a href=\"/karate-kid/4005-1269/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1269\"> Karate Kid</a>. Civilization on that world was destroyed, and most of the human population were turned into gross animal hybrids, with the two exceptions of <a href=\"/buddy-blank/4005-48221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48221\"> Buddy Blank</a>, and <a href=\"/tommy-tomorrow/4005-27941/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27941\"> Tommy Tomorrow</a>, who would become the OMAC (One Man Army Corps), and <a href=\"/kamandi/4005-3608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3608\"> Kamandi</a>. Afterward, believing the Monitors to be incapable of regulating themselves, Nix Uotan decided to set up a team of humans to \"watch the watchmen.\" The team was composed of The Atom (Ray Palmer), Donna Troy, Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), and the Forager.</p><h3>Final Crisis</h3><p>Because his actions have placed the Orrery of Worlds in danger Nix is placed on trial. Though he tries to plead his case, along with aid from <a href=\"/weeja-dell/4005-57556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57556\"> Weeja Dell </a>and others, the <a href=\"/tahoteh/4005-61666/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61666\"> Prime Moniter Tahoteh </a>would hear none of it. He found Uotan guilty and gave him the only sentence possible, exile. Nix was sent to New Earth and stripped of his powers and his word of attention. As they carried out the sentence he called out to Weeja, and suddenly awoke to find himself in an apartment.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/644094-nix_uotan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-644094\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2666666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/644094-nix_uotan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-644094\"><img alt=\"Uotan Reborn\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/644094-nix_uotan.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15297/644094-nix_uotan.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px\" data-width=\"757\"></a><figcaption>Uotan Reborn</figcaption></figure><p>Nix had no recollection of his former life. He had an apartment, bills to pay, and a job at the local Coffee-shop working with computers. He was quickly fired for talking to customers about alternate worlds, and his drawings of strange heroes, and attempt at remembering a word. When <a href=\"/darkseids-elite/4060-49088/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49088\"> Darkseid's Elite </a>released the <a href=\"/anti-life-equation/4015-42524/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42524\"> Anti-Life Equation</a>, there were those who weren't affected. Nix was captured some time later, and after it became apparent that the Equation didn't work, transported to a holding pen for those few who were immune. While in holding, he was confronted by two individuals, a man in a wheel-chair (<a href=\"/metron/4005-3616/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3616\"> Metron</a>) and an older homeless man (<a href=\"/highfather/4005-5324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5324\"> Highfather</a>) who asked him about his past. The homeless man claimed he had called them their with the power inside him, and after began questioning him about a word that would describe and release his true self. Nix remembered Weeja's name while looking at a drawing of her, and just as the guards returned a flash of light blinded them all. Nix Uotan stood before them, his power returned having been re-born.</p><p>Having revealed himself, Metron attempts to have Nix monitor and coordinate the efforts of the heroes across the globe, explaining to him that the birth of the 5th World, Men as Gods, has begun. Nix doesn't believe he can keep track of all the events, and also doesn't understand the purpose, though he begins to see as Metron begins to explain what could befall the Multiverse if they manage to destroy the <a href=\"/the-bleed/4020-41042/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41042\"> Bleed</a>.</p><p>Metron had freed Nix to operate in his capacity as a Multiversal Monitor. When <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\"> Superman </a>called him forward, he was able to challenge <a href=\"/mandrakk/4005-59487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59487\"> Mandrakk </a>personally, fulfilling his capacity as the \"Judge of All Evil\". He gathered his forces to face off against him, with Superman at his right hand. His allies included <a href=\"/captain-carrot/4005-33139/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33139\"> Captain Carrot </a>and his allies from Earth-35, the Angels of the Pax Dei seeking vengence for the destruction wrought, the <a href=\"/supermen-of-the-multiverse/4060-56175/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56175\"> Supermen of the Multiverse</a>, the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\"> Green Lantern Corps</a>, and the <a href=\"/forever-people/4060-25939/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25939\"> Forever People </a>of the 5th World.</p><p>Nix was able to defeat his father Mandrakk, and then returned to the world of the Monitors. Once there he gave a report to his fellows, explaining how the heroes of the Orrery had helped to repair it, as well as the fate of the New Gods. Nix Uotan was re-instated by his fellows, though he turned down their rewards, stating that he beleived they should no longer interfere with the Orrery. He also reconstructed Earth-51. After thanking the new prime monitor, Hermuz, he left the council chamber to seek out Weeja Dell.</p><p>Finding her out on the balcony he sought to comfort her. He explained his gratitude, as well as how it was her who had brought him back, and that they could not make him forget her face. He also explained to her what it was like to live among the \"germs\" as they call them. An experience that had changed him. He then answered her question, explaining that Superman had used his wish wisely, wishing simply for a happy ending. Nix then woke up, back in his apartment in earth 0, with the T.V. playing.</p><h3>Multiversity</h3><p>Nix Uotan reappered in <a href=\"/multiversity/4045-58028/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-58028\">Multiversity</a> series. When a an emergency signal was send from <a href=\"/earth-7/4015-56471/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56471\">earth-7</a>, Nix Uotan went to investigate. He and his sidekick <a href=\"/stubbs/4005-106715/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-106715\">Mr Stubbs</a> found the universe barren and their heroes defeated and twisted. The only survivor, <a href=\"/thunderer/4005-106712/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-106712\">Thunderer</a>, barely could stand against the invaders, the mysterious force know as <a href=\"/the-gentry/4060-61077/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61077\">the Gentry</a>. Nix gave his ship, the <a href=\"/ultima-thule/4055-58324/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-58324\">Ultima Thule</a> to Thunderer in order to take his place as the Gentry's victim, while Thunderer gathered an army. Nix then let the Gentry corrupt him and served the Gentry's master; performing several tasks including the awakening of <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a> and the attack of <a href=\"/earth-20/4015-56460/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56460\">earth-20</a>. He did this, knowing that in the process an unstoppable team of Heroes would be brought together from throughout the multiverse.</p><p>When he was summoned to <a href=\"/earth-8/4015-56470/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56470\">earth-8</a> by <a href=\"/lord-havok/4005-48734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48734\">Lord Havok</a>, he was opposed not only by the local heroes, <a href=\"/retaliators/4060-61068/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61068\">the Retaliators</a>, but also against him were the heroes recruited by Thunderer to save him. However their forces weren't enough to stop the deranged Monitor, who was halfway to summoning the other members of the Gentry to earth-8, to annihilate and corrupt all life. It was only with the combined efforts of Thunderer summoning a storm, <a href=\"/aquawoman/4005-117918/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-117918\">Aquawoman</a> stabbing him him in the eye and finally <a href=\"/red-racer/4005-106714/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-106714\">Red Racer</a> coordinating a punch at the speed of light from every speedster in the multiverse at the same time, that Uotan could be disorientated long enough to regain control.</p><p>Freed from his twisted form he gave the heroes the information they needed to stop the Gentry, for now. The <a href=\"/justice-incarnate/4060-61230/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61230\">Justice Incarnate</a> was formed , and Nix returned to his human form, just in time to pay his rent.</p><h3>Convergence</h3><p>Nix Uotan was one of the cosmic entities watching the existence of <a href=\"/telos/4005-116985/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-116985\">Telos</a>. He defined this world as an aberration from the multiverse.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Nix Uotan after becoming the Judge of all evil inherited nigh omnipotent powers. He was able to summon heroes from throughout the multiverse with but a word, and beat Mandrakk easily. He also could see into everywhere at once, shown by the blue screens around his head, what each monitor was doing.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In the far, far future of the 75th Century, a young boy began a school report on the history of Superboy. Using a time scanner, he planned to peer into the past for information on Superboy's induction into the Legion of Super-Heroes. However, the device was defective, and as it peered into the past its scanning waves had somehow warped the past and altered it, so now Superboy had failed his initiation. The boy brought this to his father's attention, who explained that if something wasn't done soon their present would unravel.¬†While his father planned to bring this to the Science Council in order to do something, the boy felt it was his responsibility to make it right. Using a few gadgets which, by his time's standards were nothing but toys but by the standards of the 30th Century they were amazing weapons, the boy travelled back in time to the 30th Century to make sure Superboy indeed joined.¬†<br/>¬†¬†<br/>The boy appeared in the Legion's HQ, calling himself Anti-Lad and asking to be judged for membership in the Legion. Anti-Lad claimed that he had the ability to reverse a person's superability on themselves, and managed to successfully defeat Colossal Boy, Lightning Lad, and Cosmic Boy, all the while acting very cocky and sure of himself. Brainiac 5 had been curious about why Anti-Lad never took off his visor, and he told him it was because his world was a thousand times brighter than Earth's, and without his visor he couldn't see.¬†<br/>¬†<br/>Brainiac 5 and Cosmic Boy began discussing about their mysterious new applicant, and soon exposed his facade when they turned on the lights in his room and he could see fine. They learned that all his abilities were in his visor. Upon further investigation of earth soil and kryptonite residue on his uniform from the 20th Century, Anti-Lad claimed he went back in time and sabotaged Superboy's initiation. Anti-Lad took that opportunity to depart the Legion back to his time, using his visor to erase the Legionnaires' memories of his time there, but with the post-hypnotic suggestion that they should give Superboy another chance.¬†The timeline had been corrected and Superboy did indeed become a member.<br/>¬†<br/>No one remembered Anti-Lad's time in the Legion, but the only thing left behind was a picture of Anti-Lad with Saturn Girl, Lightning Lad, and Cosmic Boy. This led the other Legionnaires to wonder, \"Who was Anti-Lad?\"¬†</p>",

The two developed a strong friendship and have had a sort of love-hate relationship.¬† <br />He is a very social Net-Navi and he tries to keep the peace when he is with his friends Roll, Gutsman, and Glide. These Net-Navis are the Net-Navis of Lan's friends Mayl, Dex, and Yai.<br />He has gone through many changes while fighting to keep the Net safe from evil. He obtained the ability of style-change from Dr. Hikari, which allows him to become any elemental-type Net-Navi he wants. Later on, he becomes able to unite with his friends' souls to become to take on their abilities and part of their appearance.</p>",

Her mother was raped by shapeshifting demon and she is the result of that. After the birth her own father tried to kill her, but she slashed his throat. She then was left into the jungle to die, but she survived.</p><p>Years later, she had adopted the name Rakshasa and participated on a contest where three Egyptian gods tried to find themselves a channel to this world. She met <a href=\"/purgatori/4005-42482/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42482\">Purgatori</a> there, and they fell in love from the first sight. There were six contestants, and only three were to be selected, and everyone needed to prove their worth. Her opponent was a necromancer, and she won. Then Purgatori tried to get possession of a summoning stone, and they fought again with beaten foes, emerging victorious again. Then the gods Set, Tehut, and Isis arrived. Isis selected Rakshasa as her body. Purgatori tried to fight them but was badly beaten. Then Isis/Rakshasa approached her and offered her a chance to join with her and kill other gods. Purgatori accepted and took control, killed Set and Tehut, and used Isis' power to separate herself and Rakshasa. Rakshasa and Purgatori walked away from there, together.</p><p>They are later in Egypt and try to find some info on a new messiah, but are captured by <a href=\"/lucifer/4005-49221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49221\">Lucifer</a>. Lucifer mentions that he has uses for Rakshasa and transports Purgatori to the Arctic.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"/\"></a><h2>About Haruka</h2><p>Haruka is the proprietor of the Cafe Hinata and was dorm mother of Hinata House until Keitaro arrived. For a majority of the manga she has only a small role. She is usually the voice of common sense and offers advice to the more high-strung characters when needed. Haruka offers Mutsumi a place to stay when her house burns down, which leads to Mutsumi also working at the cafe.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Haruka and Seta</h2><p>Most of Haruka's and Seta's past is revealed in vol.9. Seta comes back to Hinata House after traveling abroad, and he asks to see Haruka. Keitaro and Naru lead him to the cafe, where he surprises them by offering Haruka a ring. To confuse matters further, Haruka turns Seta down flat and throws the ring back at him.</p><p>Naru and Keitaro each talk to a member of the older couple and discover that Haruka and Seta used to be a couple back in college. They became a pair of globe-trotting adventurers until one day Seta confessed his feelings to her. Haruka never game him a reply, and with their exciting lifestyle one thing led to another and they just lost track of time. Seta didn't help matters by moving in with another woman.</p><p>When the gang travels to the beach, more of their past comes out. Sarah(Seta's daughter) explains that her mother used to go adventuring with Haruka and Seta. Seta had feelings for both of them and was unable to make a decision. He promised that by the time he was thirty he would make his choice, but Sarah's mom died before this happened. According to Sarah, Haruka basically won by default which is why she holds a grudge.</p><p>That night, Keitaro and Naru eavesdrop on the older couple and it appears that their relationship is beginning to thaw. Haruka tearfully tells Seta that they're over and shouldn't try to be young like Keitaro and Naru. Then a smile passes across her face and she tells him that since the day made her reminisce about the past, she would wear his ring... but only for the night.</p><p>Before vol. 13, Haruka had always been sort of a homebody; staying home whenever the gang would go off traveling and having adventures. When Seta shanghais Keitaro into coming with him to the island of Molmol, Haruka surprises Naru by going after them(though according to Haruka she's just going to beat Seta up). Sure enough, the first thing she does upon seeing Seta is to punch him. She later has a taste of her old life while hiding out from Su's forces in an attempt to stage Keitaro's rescue. Most importantly, she and Seta make it to the Todai Ruins. Seta again asks her to marry him, and this time she agrees. Wearing a dress that Mutsumi had brought from the capital city, she and Seta are wed. After the wedding, Haruka and Seta decide to stay on the island and complete the excavations.</p><a href=\"/\"></a><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>Haruka, Seta, and Sarah return to Hinata House for the wedding that takes place.</p>",

    "deck": "Amaterasu is the main character in Okami, and is based on as the Japanese Shinto sun-goddess of the same name. Using the power of the celestial brush, she fought against the forces of the eight-headed demon, Orochi, and his cursed power.",
    "description": "<p>For 100 years, Amaterasu, the god of nature, had been sealed away in a statue of Shiranui, the legendary wolf that slew Orochi with the great warrior Nagi.</p><p>Sakuya, the master and inhibitor of the guardian saplings, was able to reawaken the ethereal wolf with all of her power. With Ammy's reawakening, she realized that the world had changed very much. The sky was black, and the trees were dying. Sakuya explained that Orochi had just come back to life with the legendary sword used by the Hero of 100 years past,Nagi's, disappearance. The sword was named Tsukuyomi, and slew Orochi.</p><p>It was at this moment that Sakuya burst out laughing, as though she was being tickled by somebody. Out from her kimono popped a small poncle, named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a>.</p><p>\"Hey?! What was that for? I was just about to fall asleep!!\" the small guy said.</p><p>\"Did you fall asleep in my dress again, you little bug?\" Sakuya asked.</p><p>\"Uggghh!!! How many times do I have to tell you? I'm not a bug!! I'm <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a>, the wandering artist!\" the poncle screamed.</p><p>Amaterasu simply looked on amused.</p><p>After a long talk with Sakuya, Ammy knew what to do, and she was taking <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> with her. She needed to revive Sakuya's guardian sapling, but she needed something to cut down the fruit atop the tree.</p><p>\"So... your name is Amaterasu, right? Mind if I call you Ammy? Thanks. Yeah, I'm Issun the wandering artist...nice to meet you, Ammy.\" <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> said, as they moved through Nagi's cave.</p><p>After traveling far enough they saw a strange constellation in the stars. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> didn't pay attention to it at all, but Ammy knew what to do. She took her brush of the gods and filled in the blank constellation's stars, to revive the dragon god of Rejuvenation, Yomigami. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> was amazed when they were taken to the strange spiritual world where the dragon gave Amaterasu the power to restore incomplete items.</p><p>Issun realized what was happening and told Ammy about his grandfather once back in the \"real\" world with him. It was from this point on that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> and Amaterasu decide to call her brush techniques after the name of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a>'s grandpa's famous poem, \"The Celestial Brush\".</p><p>Soon after filling in the River of the heavens, Amaterasu and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> made their way to the cave of Nagi. It was here that they saw the great statue in all of it's glory....but without the sword. Amaterasu knew what to do, however, and pulled out her brush and filled it in with her newly regained Rejuvenation power. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> was amazed. As soon as this happened, another constellation appeared.... this one was the god of Power Slice, the rat, Tachigami.</p><p>He gave his consolations and said he was sorry about not being there for her in her time of need, and then offered his services to the Ethereal wolf. Now Ammy had gained back two of her lost fifteen brush powers.</p><p>\"Hey, Ammy....since your gaining all these brush powers, that means you're just like that legendary wolf Shiranui!\" <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> said, still astonished.</p><p>Ammy and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> headed out of the River of the Heavens area to the dark filled Kamiki village, and was able to cut the fruit off of the guardian Sapling for Sakuya, and was able to enter the city again. This is where they realized how much danger the city was in.</p><p>\"If only the sun were in the sky....if only we could see something in this darkness...wouldn't it be great if you could just draw a circle in the sky or something? But that's impossible..\" <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> said, with a sigh.</p><p>Amaterasu did not think it was impossible, and showed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a> that she was indeed the Sun God Okami Amaterasu. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49302\" href=\"/issun/4005-49302/\" slug=\"issun\">Issun</a>'s mouth dropped wide open.</p>",

    "deck": "Charmcaster is a human from another dimension and a former enemy of Ben 10.",
    "description": "<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Charmcaster is the daughter of Spellbinder, the greatest hero of an alternate dimension called the Ledgerdomain. Spellbinder sought to free the ralm from a tyrant called Adwaita. During their final battle Spellbinder forced his brother and youngest daughter to flee to our dimension for thier own safety. Charmcaster vowed to become the greatest sorceress ever and avenge her father. Over time however she and her Uncle Hex began using their powers for selfish purposes and Hex was eventually incarcerated.</p><h2>Ben 10</h2><p>As a young teenager Charmcaster eventually found and freed her uncle and the two began to search for a powerful magical artifact called the Keystone Of Bezel wich just so happened to have fallen into the possesion of Gwen Tennyson. Hex's intention were to recreate a the 5 Charms of Bezel wich when combined multiply any magic user power 100,000 times, all the while Charmcaster plotted to usurp the power for herself. Charmcaster and Hex battled the Tennyson family in Las Vegas and managed to rest the Keystone and complete the recreation ritual but were thwarted by Ben and Gwen Tennyson in their respective \"Wildvine\" and \"Lucky Girl\" personas and seemingly depowered.</p><p>Weeks later a newly repowered Charmcaster ambushed the Tennysons in Salem, Massachusetts and attempted to switch bodies with Ben in order to gain control of the Omnitrix and elevate her already formidable abilities, a small fluke would result in Gwen and Charmcaster's spirits switching instead. During the episode, Charmcaster was capable of casting spells while being stuck in Gwen's body. Charmcaster explains to Gwen that if it was not for her magical aura then none of her spells would have worked. Eventually the situation is rectified and Charmcaster is defeated and arrested.</p><p>Charmcaster appeared many months later as a member of the Negative 10 alongside many other Ben 10 foes but was no more succesful.</p><h2>Alien Force</h2><p>Charmcaster (like many of Ben and Gwen old rogues) returned 5 years late, with her focus now fully shifted towards Gwen. Now master magician, she seduced Kevin Levin and compelled him into helping her against the Tennysons and was able to steal Gwen's mana powers. After Kevin had tricked her, she began dueling Gwen and began to killing her. Gwen turned the tables on her and recited a spell that returned all her powers, this left Charmcaster weak, shocked and confused. Charmcaster was then informed that magic was only one aspect of who Gwen was and unlike her, she doesn't rely on magic alone. She was then sent flying through an inter-dimensional vortex conjured up by Gwen.</p><h2>Ultimate Alien</h2><p>Charmcaster refused to give up allying herself with Zombozo and Vulkanus in kidnapping Ben Tennyson's mother only to be defeated by Kevin Levin.</p><p>The hostilities would come to an end when the Alien Force is forced to enlist Charmcaster's aid in the fight against Aggregor who had tracked down a piece of the \"Map Of Infinity\" to Ledgerdomain. During the team-up Charmcaster's origins are revealed to the team and they develop a bond. She and Gwen finally realise that with her knowledge and Gwen's powers they make a super awesome team. They eventually run afoul of Adwaita and a fierce battle ensues. The source of Adwaita's power which was belived to be an Ancient Rune was revealed to be the missing map piece. Aggregor appeared out of nowhere and stole it before making his escape through the crumbling gateway. Charmcaster helped Alien Force escape but purposefully remained behind to free her people, knowing very well that \"The Door To Anywhere\" would never open again, since the Alpha Rune had left the dimension. Alien Force has then vowed to free her and her people one day.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Charmcaster is a human who comes from Ledgerdomian, where her race are able to practice and do magic. Since her race is capable of doing magic, they are also capable of controlling and manipulating mana, but takes up to five years to master it. Charmcaster can control and manipulate mana but not on the same level as Anodites such as Gwen, Sunny and Verdona. She doesn't use her bag anymore and relies on mana, but still uses magic and super powerful spells. It has also been revealed by Gwen, that magic derives from mana during the \"Where The Magic Happens\" episode. Charmcaster's mana has a lighting-like effect with a white colour to it. Another thing about her mana is that when she attacks with it, it forms large spheres around her hands that look like atoms. With her mana and magic she can: open up interdimensional portals and vortexes, shapeshift, animate, teleport, fly, levitate, fire mana lightning bolts, transform mana into elements, read auras, use compulsion, drain powers and cast spells. After Charmcaster took over of Ledgerdomain, her powers became extremely super charged since she became the realm ruler of all magic. Now she is capable of controlling all rock creatures in Ledgerdomain, fire balls of mana-magic, fire concussive mana-magic rays, change the name of the Door To Anywhere every few seconds and steal souls with ease. The soul stealing may only be done with the help of the Alpha Rune, which she also posses but only she only used it in episode: The Enemy Of Frenemy. Gwen has stated that soul stealing is: \"The darkest of all dark magic.\"</p><p>Charmcaster carried a twisted looking bag, that seems to be a pocket dimension. Allowing her to store an unlimited amount of items in the bag. She is last carrying it in \"Ben 10 VS Negative 10\". The bag makes another appearance in \"Where the magic happens\".</p><p>She also wields a power staff similar to her uncle's now that she has become a master magician and is capable of emitting powerful blasts of destructive energy.</p><p>Spells used by Charmcaster</p><p>Ocktoon- gives life to any inanimate object.</p><p>Ocktoon Eradico- gives life to a picture or drawing.</p><p>Tempestus- allows the caster to manipulate water at will.</p><p>Vitalis Eruptum- allows the caster to make seeds grow into vines and manipulate them.</p><p>Valieris Mihi Occoltus Valieris Meus Amacitia Occoltus- allows the caster to create a dome of pink mana that allows anyone within it to become invisible. The caster must spin in a circle in order create the dome. You also can't use the dome while moving.</p><p>Amplusmica- allows the caster to fire magic powder that can turn whatever it hits into a field of flowers, such as a huge area of sharp rocks.</p><p>Reptilicus- makes a staff or any object turn into a snake instantly.</p><p>Meus Manus Manus- makes any staff or object fly into the hands of the caster.</p><p>Eratico- blows up the target of the caster.</p><p>Atherfo- causes flowers to levitate and spin at speeds capable of slicing through rock.</p><p>Perturbo- creates a bridge of mana-magic that is capable of passing over and through a mystic sink hole. This spell can only work with a combination of powerful magic users such as Gwen and Charmcaster.</p><p>Hitreya- makes \" The Door to Anywhere\" appear.</p><p>Vita- allows the caster to summon numerous rock creatures from the ground.</p>",

    "description": "<p> Max is Grandfather to Ben and Gwen. He has taken the kids on a summer road trip across the country. It is during this time that Ben finds the Omnitrix. Max helps Ben and Gwen come into their powers while trying to hid the fact that he fought Aliens, instead of being a real Plumber.  ¬†In an early episode one of Max's old partners, turned up and was fighting aliens. Many of the aliens Max (grandpa) started recognizing as ones they had previously captured and placed in the Null Void Projector. As the episode progressed it was revealed (shocker) that Grandpa‚Äôs old partner Phil was using the Null Void Projector to release the aliens so that he could fight them again to regain his importance. He had hoped Max would join him, but Max choose to side with his family. </p> <p> Throughout the episodes Max has shown his worth with both his intelligence and his abilities to their ‚Äúteam‚Äù of alien fighters. </p> <p> In a made for¬†T.V. live action movie Max Tennyson was played by Lee Majors.<br/><br/>In Ben 10 Alien Force, Max Tennyson is shown to be asking for Ben's help on a case. It has been 5 years since Ben, Max, and Gwen have had any adventures. So when Ben was still at the age of 10, he decided to remove the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-53930\" href=\"/omnitrix/4055-53930/\" slug=\"omnitrix\">Omnitrix</a>. Locking it away in his cabinet. However, Ben donned the Omnitrix once more and got a new set of aliens. Max is not seen a lot in this series, he got a physical appearance in episode 6 called \"Max Out.\" Where he teleported himself and a Hybrid to the Null Void. Ben and his team, thought that he was killed.</p>",

She ran into Dick again after he accidently became a model for her. After seeing newspaper clippings of Nightwing( <a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\"> Jason Todd</a>) she started creating superhero themed designs. Cheyenne wore a Nightwing costume to help Dick and Jason from a metahuman monster named Jakob. He ate her, but she used her powers to blow him up from the inside.

    "description": "<p>Born in a town in Germany called Ulm, he went to pursie a life of science when he became an adult. uring one of his many studies, he developed the relativity theory at the age of 26. Seeing he was partial to the scientific field of physics, he worked as a teacher of theoretic physics in academic univeristies across Germany.</p><p>He was captured and sent to a small community called Dodge city in 1871, by a creature known as the chronovore, who feeds on time itself. He soon realized through all of the confusion that he was forced to travel time against his own will and he set out to find an explanation.</p><p>During his journey he met western heroes such as Kid Colt, Two-Gun Kid, Rawhide Kid and the Phantom Rider. After getting to know the heroes, he was soon referred by the heroes as \"Uncle Al\". They decided to help Albert in his quest for an explanation and they provided Einstein with advanced alien technology from their known allies. As Albert would began to utilize the technology to his benefit, he would be protected by the heroes from all sorts of threats.</p><p>Soon enough, a threat did rise, a leader of a gang of raiders was under the belief that the western heroes were protecting valuable food and gold. They launched many raids until they were defeated by the western heroes and other heroes who travelled from the 20th century.</p><p>After discovering that time could only be manipulated, he</p><p>to make a machine to help him get back to his original time but his dream quickly was abandoned as he couldn't find any power source to run the machine. Soon Albert and other time-hopping heroes discovered the same creature that sent im to this time and the group was swallowed by the beast. They were forced to travel through different periods of time to attempt to reach the source of the creature, the brain.</p><p>As soon as they reached the source, tey found out the creature was being tortured by the villainous Doctor Doom. The heroes defeated Doctor Doom while Albert examined the machine that was able to manipulate the time-eating creature. Einstein was able to reconfigure the machine in order for the creature to restore the displacement of the time that was created by Doom.</p><p>Einstein did return to his time, where he would remember his time-travels but he pursued in his field of physics to become a legend for centuries to come.</p><h2>E-Man Comics</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1271156-13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1271156\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.4558823529412\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1271156-13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1271156\"><img alt=\"E-Man's Costume\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1271156-13.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1271156-13.jpg 204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px\" data-width=\"204\"></a><figcaption>E-Man's Costume</figcaption></figure><p>In E-Man Comics Einstein is always prominent.

    "description": "<h2>Heero's Early Life</h2> <p>Heero Yuy was born on an unknown date in After Colony 180. Little is known about the boys early life, though it was known that, by the age of seven, Heero was already working with Odin Lowe, the assassin of the original Heero Yuy, a politician fighting for pacifism. Odin taught Heero much of what he knew about being a soldier, such as how to handle a firearm. When Heero was eight years old, Heero and Odin were sent to colony L3-X18999 to assasinate General Septum, a General under <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49123\" href=\"/the-alliance/4060-49123/\" slug=\"the-alliance\">The Alliance</a>. Odin was put in charge of the assassination, but Heero had his part to play as well. Heero attempted to destroy one of The Alliance communications tower, in which a twelve year old <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49285\" href=\"/lucrezia-noin/4005-49285/\" slug=\"lucrezia-noin\">Lucrezia Noin</a> was operating. Before the missles could hit the tower, though, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49286\" href=\"/treize/4005-49286/\" slug=\"treize\">Treize</a>, who was the instructor of the facility, moved a Leo he was piloting in the way of the on-coming missles. The resulting explosion seriously injured <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49286\" href=\"/treize/4005-49286/\" slug=\"treize\">Treize</a>, but he was able to save the site, which may have been a factor in his becoming leader of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49121\" href=\"/oz/4060-49121/\" slug=\"oz\">OZ</a>. </p> <p>Heero attempted to run away and find Odin Lowes. When the boy found the man, Odin was fatally wounded. With his dying breath, Odin told Heero that he must live by his emotions, for it takes only one foolish person to change the world. Heero then took to wandering the colonies, but he was discovered by Doctor J, a lead part of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49125\" href=\"/the-colony-liberation-organization/4060-49125/\" slug=\"the-colony-liberation-organization\">The Colony Liberation Organization</a>. Dr. J began to admire the boy, and offered him a job piloting a Gundam. Heero accepted the Doctor's offer, and the two left.</p><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/50000/49117/110134-heero-yuy_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/50000/49117/110134-heero-yuy_150.jpg\"/></a><br/> ¬† <b>Heero in his Gundam</b><br/>Heero later appeared under the Code name Black Alpha in the Sanc Kingdom when he was 11 years old. Here, he met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>, and aided in a anti-Alliance assault.<br/> <p>When he was fourteen years old, Heero was assigned with the destruction of an The Alliance base on one of the space colonies. He successfully set the explosives for the bases destruction, but decided to wait until night came before destroying the building. He spent the time he had left in a park, where he met a women with her dog. The two began to talk, and became friends, but they seperated.</p> <p>That night, Heero activated the bombs in the base, and it was destroyed. A Leo, hit by the explosion, was knocked into a earby building, crushing it before the Leo exploded. Investigating the ruins of the building, Heero found the girl from the park's dog. He discovered that the girl was destroyed in the explosion, and became grief-stricken over what he had done. He buried the dog (and possibly the girl, if he found her), and Dr. J was ordered to train the boy to forget emotions,as his emotions would get in his way on the battlefield. It is unknownif this training was carried out, but it is obvious by his seemingly emotionless appearance later that he was affected by her death.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <b><h3>Operation Meteor</h3></b> <p>In After Colony 195, Heero and four other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49120\" href=\"/the-gundam-pilots/4060-49120/\" slug=\"the-gundam-pilots\">The Gundam Pilots</a> (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-49118\" href=\"/duo-maxwell/4005-49118/\" slug=\"duo-maxwell\">Duo Maxwell</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49119\" href=\"/trowa-barton/4005-49119/\" slug=\"trowa-barton\">Trowa Barton</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49282\" href=\"/quatre/4005-49282/\" slug=\"quatre\">Quatre</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49283\" href=\"/wufei/4005-49283/\" slug=\"wufei\">Wufei</a>) were sent to Earth in an attempt to destroy The Alliance and OZ. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49126\" href=\"/zechs-merquise/4005-49126/\" slug=\"zechs-merquise\">Zechs Merquise</a>, one of the top members of OZ, noticed the five ships, but because of its position, the shuttle could only intercept one of the shuttles, Heero's. Heero began to enter Earth's atmosphere, and noticed a civilian shuttle in his direct path. He attempted o shoot down the shuttle, but when Zechs' ship appeared behind him, he decided against it, not wanting to draw attention to himself. He was unable to keep a low profile, though, and he attacked the ship with the Wing Gundam. Zechs sent out two of his men, and both of them were destroyed by one shot from Heero's Beam Cannon. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49126\" href=\"/zechs-merquise/4005-49126/\" slug=\"zechs-merquise\">Zechs Merquise</a> then attacked the Wing Gundam, and was able to get close enough to the Gundam to bgrapple it, before he parachuted out of his Leo, leaving Heero and his Mobile Suit to plummet into the Ocean.</p> <p>Heero was washed up onto the beach after his Gundam had been sent to the bottom of the sea. He was found here by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a> Darlian, The daughter of a wealthy aristocrat and who had been in the shuttle that Heero was going to shoot down. Relena became scared after finding what she thought was an Alliance Soldier, and she called an ambulance for the boy. As the ambulance arrived, Heero awoke, and seeing that he had been found, he proceeded to escape, knocking out the hospital workers and hijacking their ambulance. </p> <p>To conceal his identity, Heero joined a local school, and which, whether coincidental or purposeful, was the same school that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a> attended. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>, who had began to harbor a kind of obsession for Heero, gave him an invitation to her birthday party. though everyone cheered after her asking, Heero proceeded to tear the letter in half. This caused <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a> to cry, and Heero wiped away her tear, before telling her that he was going to kill her, and leaving. Later that day, in fencing class, one of Relena's friends challenged Heero to a duel, wanting to impress <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a> and to put down Heero. in the duel, Heero's foil broke, but he proceeded to stab the broken weapon through his enemies mask, telling him to ask for the invitation next time, for then he would give it to him instead of tearing it up. During one of the horse riding classes Heero snuck onto a computer, trying to find missles that could be used to destroy the Wing Gundam before OZ could get their hands on it. On the day of Relena's birthday party, proceeded to infiltrate a Alliance military base, hijacking multiple torpedoes in the process. When he is abou to launch the torpedoes, though, he is stopped by none other then <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>, who had skipped her own party to find Heero. Heero then pulled out a gun, fully prepared to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>, and therefore silencing the only person who knew that he is a pilot of some sort. Before he can shoot <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a> though, he is himself shot in the arm, by a strange man with a braid. Heero then attempts to get the gun, but is shot again. Before the man can shoot Heero a final time, he is saved by none other then <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>, asking the mysterious man why he would want to shoot Heero, completely ignoring the fact that the man was shooting Heero to protect <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>. Heero takes this opurtunity to launch the torpedoes manually, before falling into the water with a satisfied \"Mission Accomplished.\" </p> <p>Heero later wakes up in a hospital run by The Alliance, to which he was brought to by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>. He is able to control his breathing as to make it look like he is still unconcious, and he begins to wait for the chance to escape. As he is waiting, the screen suddenly appears before him, and on it is the man who had shot him. Heero readshis lips, and is told that the man's name is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49118\" href=\"/duo-maxwell/4005-49118/\" slug=\"duo-maxwell\">Duo Maxwell</a>, another Gundam pilot, and that Duo wishes to get him out of the hospital. Heero accepts, and Duo breakshim out by blowing up the wall of the room Heero is in. The two begin to escape, Heero with a parachute and Duo with a handheld helicopter. The two jump out of the window, and Duo activates hism helicopter. Heero, on the other hand, is planning on dying, and allows himself to plummet to Earth. Suddenly, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a> calls Heero's name, and Heero activates his parachute, but he is to close to the ground. Heero then begins to slide on the side of the wall, slowing his impact before he hits the ground, breaking his leg. Duo and he then escape. Heero later resets his own leg (much to Duo's disgust) and prepares to fix his Gundam.</p> <p>Duo and Heero then begin attending a new school as to not draw suspicion to themselves. They proved in a game of basketball their superior physical abilities, and after the game, Duo attempts to get Heero to lighten up a little, since they are on the same side. Then, a limosine pulls up next to the two, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a> steps out of the car. After a brief talk, Heero leaves. </p><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/50000/49118/138092-duo-maxwell_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/50000/49118/138092-duo-maxwell_150.jpg\"/></a><br/><h3>Duo Maxwell</h3> <br/><br/> <p>The next day, Heero is given the assignment of destroying an OZ Mobile Suit carrier. Heero begins to fix the damages he inflicted on the Wing Gundam. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49118\" href=\"/duo-maxwell/4005-49118/\" slug=\"duo-maxwell\">Duo Maxwell</a> offers to Help Heero fix the damages to his Gundam with some extra parts, Heero declines. Duo finds him to be foolish in this decision, since not even the world's greatest engineer could fix anything without the right parts. Heero just ignores Duo's protests, and continues to work on his Gundam. As the OZ carrier flies overhead, Heero prepares to launch, and too the astonishment of Duo, he is able to take off. A few seconds later, Duo learned that Heero had actually stolen the parts from the Deathscythe, and Duo becomes pissed. Heero then destroys the carrier, and he and Duo go their seperate ways. </p> <p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>, in a story following this, witnesses her \"father's\" death, only to learn that he is not her father, but that she is a Peacecraft, a family devoted to pacifism. She is about to be killed by OZ, but she is saved by the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49125\" href=\"/the-colony-liberation-organization/4060-49125/\" slug=\"the-colony-liberation-organization\">The Colony Liberation Organization</a>, led by Doctor J, Heero's old teacher. He tells her about Heero, and she begins to understand him.</p> <p>Heero soon calls in a transfer from the school, as it will make his next mission much easier to accomplish. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>, after hearing this, rushes up to his room, and confronts him. He pulls a gun on her, but does not kill her, since it would only lead to an investigation into him, and he couldn't afford that. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a> is able to convince Heero to go to the dance, and the two of them dance to a slow song. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a> asks if he is still going to kill her, which he replies to with a yes. She then says that she is fine with this, and that she is now on his side. Heero becomes confused by this, but just then, it is noticed that the party is attacked by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49287\" href=\"/lady-une/4005-49287/\" slug=\"lady-une\">Lady Une</a>, a lead member of OZ. Though <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49287\" href=\"/lady-une/4005-49287/\" slug=\"lady-une\">Lady Une</a> is their to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>, Heero mistakes it folr an attempt on his life. He then takes his Gundam and begins to attack the attacking Mobile Suits. In the ensuing chaos, missles hit the building above <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">Relena</a>, but before she can be crushed by rubble, Heero saves her, both to her and his astonishment, as he had said earlier that night that he was going to kill her Heero then attempts tokill her with the Gundam, but can not will himself to do it. Infuriated at himself, he charges at the enemy Mobile Suits wiping them all out. Heero then leaves the party, confused and angry with himself.</p> <p>Heero, along with all of the other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49120\" href=\"/the-gundam-pilots/4060-49120/\" slug=\"the-gundam-pilots\">The Gundam Pilots</a>, is given orders to attack an OZ base where multiple of OZ's top members would be. Heero and Duo meet up there, and also two of the three remaining Gundam Pilots, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49119\" href=\"/trowa-barton/4005-49119/\" slug=\"trowa-barton\">Trowa Barton</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49282\" href=\"/quatre/4005-49282/\" slug=\"quatre\">Quatre</a>. The four Gundam Pilots are quickly overwhelmed by the enemy, but the Pilots do not give up the fight. Soon, a plane with the logo of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49121\" href=\"/oz/4060-49121/\" slug=\"oz\">OZ</a> takes off from the base, and Heero quickly destroys the shuttle. Heero returns to the ground victorious, but then <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49283\" href=\"/wufei/4005-49283/\" slug=\"wufei\">Wufei</a>, the last gundam pilot, appears, telling them they have all been fooled. The ship that heero had just destroyed was actually a plane full of pacifistic delegates, and, with them dead, <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49121\" href=\"/oz/4060-49121/\" slug=\"oz\">OZ</a> had a perfect chance to take over. Heero was forced to leave in defeat.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>History</h2>¬†<br/><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Duo was born on the colonies in the year After Colony 180. Duo was abandoned young as a child, and has no recolection of his real name or his real family. By the year After Colony 187, Duo had joined a street gang, led by a boy calling himself Solo. Solo fell ill with a fever in AC 187, and declared Duo his successor, telling Duo that he would always be with him. Duo then took on the name \"Duo,\" saying \"If Solo's with me, we'll be Duo.\"</p><p>Duo and the rest of his gang were taken in by a foster care calling themselves the Maxwell Church. Duo watched as all of his friends got adopted, and he was also eventually adopted. He was sent back by his adoptive parents though, and Father Maxwell and Sister Helen, the leaders of the Maxwell Church, adopted him. He was then given his signature braid, and made his firm stance that he believed only in the God of Death, as he only saw deadpeople, and never saw any miracles. </p><p>The colony that Duo lived on was eventually taken over by rebels, and Duo made a deal with the rebels. If he could steal a Mobile Suit for them, then they would leave the church alone. Duo succeeded in stealing a a mobile suit, but all that he returned to what would later be called the \"Maxwell Church Tragedy.\" He discovered in the midst of 245 dead people a dead Father Maxwell, and a dying Sister Helen. Sister Helen died in Duo's arms, and Duo took on the name Maxwell as his last name. </p><p>When Duo was twelve, he stowed away on a ship, only to be discovered by Doctor G. Duo introduced himself with his famous \"Duo Maxwell, who may run and hide, but never tells a lie.\" Doctor G takes in Duo as his apprentice.</p><p>Duo later was brought into the rebels, and given the piloting rights to the Deathscythe. Duo opposed Operation Meteor, and attempted to destroy the Deathscythe. This tactic failed, and he was convinced by Doctor G to steal the Gundam instead. Duo succeeded in stealing the Gundam, and he headed towards earth.¬†</p><br/><h3>On Earth</h3><p>After arriving on earth, Duo, using the amazing stealth of the DeathScythe, attacks a Mobile Suit manufacturing factory under the control of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49123\" href=\"/the-alliance/4060-49123/\" slug=\"the-alliance\">     The Alliance</a>, and then later attacks a group of Cancers led by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49126\" href=\"/zechs-merquise/4005-49126/\" slug=\"zechs-merquise\">     Zechs Merquise</a> to salvage another Gundam, the Wing Gundam. Duo saves the Wing Gundam, and, thinking he can use it for spare parts, deactivates its self-destruct mechanism and brings it to the surface. He then goes to an Alliance Military base, where he sees a young man, who turns ot to be another Gundam Pilot named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49117\" href=\"/heero-yuy/4005-49117/\" slug=\"heero-yuy\">     Heero Yuy</a>, threatening a woman, who is actually <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">     Relena</a>, at gun point. Before Heero can shoot <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">     Relena</a>, Duo shoots the man in the arm, disarming him. Heero then attempts to get his gun, but Duo shoots the other pilot again. Before Duo can finish off the other Gundam mPilot though, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">     Relena</a> Steps in the way, asking Duo why he wants to shoot Heero. This confuses The gundam Pilot, since all he was doing was saving <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49284\" href=\"/relena/4005-49284/\" slug=\"relena\">     Relena</a> from being killed by Heero. Before he can do anything else though, the Wing Gundam begins to come up from the sea. Duo blinds Relena with a bright light, telling her to be careful, or he'll have to kill her. Heero is able to take this oppurtunity to launch torpedoes he had set for the Wing Gundam, and Duo is unable to stop the man from firing the torpedoes at the Gundam. <br/></p><h3>The Deathscythe</h3>Duo's Gundam is built for hit and run operations.¬† The Gundam is armed with \"hyper jammers\" located on the back section of the mobile suit.¬† The hyper jammers transmit a frequency that blocks all communications within a designated radius, these hyper jammers also project an \"invisibility cloak that to almost all detection, invisible. ¬†¬†<br/>¬†<br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/48301/1076390-gw_d_hell3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1076390\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/48301/1076390-gw_d_hell3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1076390\"><img alt=\"¬†Deathscythe Hell(improved version of Deathscythe)\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48301/1076390-gw_d_hell3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/48301/1076390-gw_d_hell3.jpg 640w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48301/1076390-gw_d_hell3.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>¬†Deathscythe Hell(improved version of Deathscythe)</figcaption></figure> <p>¬†The Deathscythe was destroyed during Duo's attempts to reach outer space. ¬†¬†Duo was forced to abandon his suit and flee back to his home colony.¬† But during a training exercise Trowa piloting the¬†<b>\"OZ-13MSX1 Vayeate</b>\" shot it down.¬† Duo eventually was captured on his home sweeper colony by an OZ soldier piloting Wing Zero.¬† Duo with Wu Fei were eventually broken out of incarceration by the group of professors who had build the gundams and upgraded Nataku and Deathscythe.¬† Deathscythe had attained a new level of power which employed a newly improved set of hyper jammers, a magnetic defense unit concealed within the wings, and a twin scythe equipped with boosters for enhanced power. <br/>¬†<br/>In other media the Deathscythe appeared in the movie \"<u><i>Gundam Wing Endless Waltz\"</i></u>.¬† The Deathscythe was refurbished and took on a totally new design sporting new larger wings, and a new set of armor colors and plating.¬† The twin scythe was replaced by a larger death scythe with only one beam.¬† This new scythe's beam in fact was considerably larger though.   </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/48301/1081769-wallpaper51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081769\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/48301/1081769-wallpaper51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081769\"><img alt=\"¬†Deathscythe Hell Custom(Endless Waltz movie adaption)\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48301/1081769-wallpaper51.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/48301/1081769-wallpaper51.jpg 640w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48301/1081769-wallpaper51.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>¬†Deathscythe Hell Custom(Endless Waltz movie adaption)</figcaption></figure> <p><br/><br/></p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Brigid, which means \"strength\" in Gaelic, was Ireland's first Protector. Conjured from the core of Ireland itself, Brigid's lineage can be traced to that of the Tuatha de Danann, or The People of the Goddess, a race of warrior-druids that inhabited ancient Ireland who were \"more than mortal, but less than divine.\" Brigid is called upon to defend the land, to uphold the traditions of its people, and to protect those born to its soil. Her primary foe has been the Dark One, an evil king, famous for his heinous crimes against the Irish, and the most dangerous of all the dark faerie.</p><p>With the legendary Spear of Lugh as her weapon, Brigid is a powerful enemy, and the only force of her generation strong enough to challenge the Dark One.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Generations after her death, her spirit inhabits 18-year old <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/derdre-glynis/4005-91403/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-91403\" rel=\"nofollow\">Derdre Glynis</a>, whose destiny is to either join the Dark One, or to defeat him and save Ireland for the current (Medieval Ireland) age.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Born in the small town of Zephillia, Lina would eventually run away from home and became a sorceress infamous throughout the lands as Lina Inverse, the Enemy of All Who Live!</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lina Inverse was created by Hajime Kanzaka for an amateur story contest in Dragon magazine in 1989. He not only won the contest but was offered to continue it as a serial feature in the magazine. These were later collected into a series of novels and were popular enough to inspire several manga and anime series based upon it. Lina Inverse was created specifically to be the antithesis of stereotypical heroines; she is not only short but very petite in addition to her greedy, materialistic personality does not normally match that of most heroes.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Born in the small town of Zephillia, Lina was the youngest daughter to her parents and had an elder sister, Luna. Although her parents ran the town's grocery store; her father was an ex-swordsman and her mother was a retired sorceress and they both passed on their skills to Lina. Despite her raw intelligence and innate skill in sorcery, Lina felt constantly overshadowed by her beautiful and even stronger sister, Luna who was much more powerful than her.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/88853/1959109-luna.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1959109\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.74666666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/88853/1959109-luna.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1959109\"><img alt=\"Luna Inverse; the Strongest Waitress in the World\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/88853/1959109-luna.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/88853/1959109-luna.jpg 600w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/88853/1959109-luna.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Luna Inverse; the Strongest Waitress in the World</figcaption></figure><p>As a mere child, Luna Inverse was said to have slain a dragon with nothing more than a kitchen knife and could cut through a Dragon Slave, the most powerful black magic spell known (and the equivalent of a magical tactical nuclear bomb) with a regular sword and was ultimately named as the Knight of Ceiphied.</p><p>With an elder sister like that; Lina developed a massive inferiority complex towards her. When their family suffered from hard times, Luna took a job as a waitress to help make ends meet while Lina, a budding entrepreneur; created a magical device that would project large scale images. She promptly used this projector to sell images of her sister bathing. Luna was not pleased and her legendary wrath and the punishment that she inflicted upon Lina continues to terrify her years later.</p><p>It was this incident that apparently prompted Lina to run away from home. She would become an apprentice to a magical academy where she quickly gained her mastery and was awarded her own Color Title; a prestigious denotation of magical ability as only the greatest of magic users and wielders such as the legendary Rezo the Red Priest. However much to her embarrassment, Lina hated being referred to as Lina the Pink and only rarely utilizes it.</p><p>Rather than teaching or theorizing or studying magic, Lina decided to embark on a life of adventuring and would become known (or perhaps notorious) as she wanders the world in search of money, power, and food. Her favorite tactic is to destroy various bandit gangs and stealing their loot for herself earning her the nickname of <i>\"The Bandit Killer\"</i>. Her legendary temper, her stick-like figure, gluttonous appetite, and tendency to cause massive collateral damage and mayhem have resulted in her reputation as <i>\"The Enemy of All Who Live\"</i> and even dragons have been known to be repulsed or scared off by her mere presence resulting in many referring to her as <i>\"The Dragon Spooker\"</i> or more formally as <i>\"The One Whom Dragons Step Clear Out of Sheer Revulsion\".</i> While she prefers to refer to herself as the <i>\"Beautiful Genius Sorceress\"</i>, most refer to her as <i>\"that Brainless Breast-less Sorceress\"</i>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41116/1693396-360013_283328.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1693396\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.36460554371\" data-width=\"469\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 469px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41116/1693396-360013_283328.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1693396\"><img alt=\"Lina &amp; her companions\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41116/1693396-360013_283328.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/41116/1693396-360013_283328.jpg 469w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px\" data-width=\"469\"></a><figcaption>Lina &amp; her companions</figcaption></figure><p>However her considerable power and tendency to get into trouble has resulted in Lina becoming involved in a number of world threatening situations and she has found herself forced to help save the world from disaster and destruction every so often; although she usually tries to make sure that someone pays her for her troubles.</p><p>Her main traveling companion is <a href=\"/gourry-gabriev/4005-49158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49158\" data-mce-href=\"/gourry-gabriev/4005-49158\">Gourry Gabriev</a> and the two secretly fall in love with each other.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Lina might have named herself as a \"Genius Sorceress\", but her boasts aren't exactly without some merit. Aside from the fact that she can cast extraordinarily high-level spells and incantations; unlike the vast majority of magic wielders, she can wield spells from various different schools including Shamanistic and White Magic, although she is perhaps best known for her mastery of Black Magic. Most magic wielders usually only specialize in one major school unlike Lina who has been known to cast spells from all of them.</p><p>Among her spells include the most powerful Black Magic Spell of them all‚Äî<i><b>the Dragon Slave</b></i>. Over centuries, this spell name has become garbled and corrupted from it's original namesake: Dragon Slayer. This spell can not only kill a dragon in one shot, but is capable of wiping out an entire mountain or even an entire city easily.</p><p>Lina is also capable of casting other more powerful spells with assistance. Frequently, she employs her Demon Blood Talismans, a set of four ruby gems that she wears on her person that enable her to greatly boost her magical capacity. With the aid of these gems, she can cast the Giga Slave; an even more powerful and destructive spell than the Dragon Slave. The Giga Slave is capable of annihilating anything and even an imperfect version of this spell was capable of slaying one of the High Mazoku (Demon Lords) such as Ruby Eye Shabranigdo. Lina's first attempt at utilizing this spell created a \"sea of death\" where nothing can grow even to this day. Lina has since perfected the casting of this spell when she inadvertently discovered that this spell called upon the Lord of Nightmares who created the World itself. However this spell is a dangerous, double-edged sword as if Lina should lose control of the massive magical forces she is wielding, this spell can erase all of existence.</p><h2>List of Spells used by Lina Inverse</h2><p>Black Magic</p><ul><li>Dragon Slave</li><li>Giga Slave</li></ul><p>Shamanistic Magic</p><ul><li>Fireball</li><li>Flare Arrow</li><li>Freeze Arrow</li><li>Ice Ball</li><li>Levitation</li><li>Wind Barrier</li></ul><p>White Magic</p><ul><li>Healing Spell</li></ul><p>Others</p><ul><li>Ragna Blade</li></ul>",
