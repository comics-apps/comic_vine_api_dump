    "description": "<h2>Creation</h2><p>Sarah Bryant was created by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Suzuki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yu Suzuki</a> for the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sega/4010-3670/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-3670\">Sega</a> video game series <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/virtua-fighter/3025-231/\">Virtua Fighter</a> that debuted in 1993. She has appeared in every title since and has made appearances in other games such as <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/dead-or-alive-5-ultimate/3030-42599/\">Dead or Alive 5</a>. She has been voiced by Lynn Harris, Claire O'Connor, Colleen Lanki, and Ayumi Tsunematsu.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Virtua Fighter</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"Yahoo!\"</em></p></blockquote><p>According to the game's story, Sarah, youngest daughter of the Bryant family becomes suspicious of the circumstances surrounding her brother <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/jacky-bryant/3005-456/\">Jacky</a>'s horrible accident in the 1990 Indianapolis 500. While investigating this accident, a mysterious group called Judgment 6 kidnapped and brainwashed her. Her innate fighting sense aroused by the brainwashing, Sarah was sent into World Martial Arts Tournament to deliver the knock-out blow to her brother Jacky.</p><h3>Virtua Fighter 2</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"Better run home to mamma now!\"</em></p></blockquote><p>As the second tournament unfolds, Sarah is still brainwashed. However, J6 could not control her completely during the last tournament, and she failed to carry out her orders. She is further trained over the next year by the Organization to become the strongest fighting machine in the hopes that she will kill her older brother, Jacky.</p><h3>Virtua Fighter 3</h3><p>Although Sarah was rescued at the tournament by Jacky, who claimed to be her brother, all of her memories had been wiped clean. Although occasional fragments of her memories began to return as she lived her daily life, she found that they returned far more often during her training. With the hope that prolonged combat will advance her memory recollection, she decided to enter the third tournament.</p><h3>Virtua Fighter 4</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"Even good guys blow it, ahahaha!\"</em></p></blockquote><p>Since the end of the third tournament, Sarah has fully regained her memories. Life went back to normal for all the Bryants, but Sarah still felt a twinge of uncertainty. Even though she has recovered, she remembered all the bad things she had done while under the Organization's control. Worst of all, she remembers trying to kill Jacky.</p><p>She is also unable to remember clearly enough if the desire to kill Jacky was a result of J6's brainwashing, or if it was part of her own wishes all along. When she finds out that Jacky intends to join the fourth tournament, she decides to do so as well, so that she can beat Jacky and resolve matters once and for all.</p><h3>Virtua Fighter 5</h3><blockquote><p><em>\"You'll enjoy this, trust me. Ready?\"</em></p></blockquote><p>During the Fourth World Fighting Tournament, it was revealed that J6 had sinister motives for Sarah and she was in great danger. <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/vanessa-lewis/3005-462/\">Vanessa</a> offered to protect her and infiltrate the organization when suddenly, in the middle of the tournament, Vanessa disappeared.</p><p>When Sarah finds out that her brother, Jacky, aims to destroy the criminal organization and has been secretly training for the Fifth World Fighting Tournament, she decides to enter in the hopes she can surpass him and bring peace to her past. Sarah doesn't realize that her efforts play neatly into J6's hands and put her in more danger than ever before.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Sarah is a confident and optimistic young college student who often masks her feelings with a smile. Her favorite hobbies are skydiving and relaxing on the beach. She also enjoys fighting and is always quick to talk down on her opponents when they fail to meet her expectations.</p><p>Ever since she was a young girl, Sarah admired and envied her brother's successes; so much so that she sought to surpass Jacky by beating him one-on-one, which usually ended with Jacky emerging victorious. Despite this, Sarah still cares deeply for her brother, and she will never forgive Judgement 6 for all the things they made her do to him while under the organization's control.</p><h2>Fighting Style</h2><p>Before Virtua Fighter 4, Sarah's main fighting style was <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jeet-kune-do/4015-57002/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-57002\">Jeet Kune Do</a>, which is a unique among <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/martial-arts/4015-56239/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56239\">martial arts</a>, as it is the first to advocate total freedom for its practitioners and the absence of \"form\".</p><p>Jeet Kune Do is a philosophy developed by martial arts master <a href=\"/bruce-lee/4005-35606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35606\">Bruce Lee</a>. During his <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kung-fu/4015-56991/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56991\">Kung Fu</a> training, Lee became disenchanted with the rigid styles and forms taught by martial arts schools. While the fundamentals of each style were important building blocks, to Lee they became barriers to true mastery. He began combining elements of Wing Chun, Western Boxing, and Fencing and thus Jeet Kune Do was born (since 1967).</p><p>Jeet Kune Do is not a particular style of Kung Fu or other martial arts, nor is it a series of techniques; it is a philosophy on living life at the pinnacle of development. Jeet Kune Do allows a martial artist to create his own expression. There aren't particular rules that make up the style -- it is a truly free art, encompassing everything, yet possessed by nothing. It rejects the rigid forms and katas used by other martial arts, and instead stresses spontaneity and intense training of the body for peak performance.</p><p>Lee created a style of Kung Fu called Jun Fan (which was his birth name) to work in conjunction with Jeet Kune Do. This style can be thought of as a more practical application of the philosophies of Jeet Kune Do. It is a pragmatic and free-form approach that teaches students to be competent in all arenas of fighting.</p><p>Since Virtua Fighter 4, Sarah fights with general 'Martial Arts', which includes <a title=\"wikipedia:Savate\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Savate</a>, <a title=\"wikipedia:Taekwondo\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taekwondo</a> and <a title=\"wikipedia:Karate\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate</a> style. However, it seems that her style still has some characteristics like Flamingo stances and grappling.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><ul><li><strong>Name:</strong> Sarah Bryant</li><li><strong>Sex</strong>: Female</li><li><strong>Hobby</strong>: Skydiving</li><li><strong>Fighting Style</strong>: Jeet Kune Do (Pre-Virtua Fighter 4), Savate, Taekwondo, and Karate</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: July 4, 1973</li><li><strong>Blood Type</strong>: AB</li><li><strong>Height</strong>: 173 cm</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 55 kg</li><li><strong>Job</strong>: College Student</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li></ul><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Animated</h3><h3>Virtua Fighter Anime (series)</h3><p>Sarah is kind and gentle in the anime, she and Jacky are the children of a wealthy American family.

Hume was fascinated with the idea of utilizing the deadly toxins with the creature and set about developing and researching ways to harness the its potent poisons. His research and analysis was flawed, and despite apprehension and warnings from peers, Hume believe he had created a universal anti-toxin and injected himself with a serum concoction. Consequently Hume suffered extreme adverse affects, his physical body mutating severally and his mind broken and driven mad. Giant mutated growths and tumors would manifest on his body, he would lose hair and limbs would swell and mutate. His body would also now house deadly and toxic tendrils that would emit from various openings on his body. These he could control and use to poison and sting others. Gordon Hume now a foul psychopath would be referred to and dubbed as many things, The Nematocyst and The Cubozoan Killer but he is best known simply as The Cube. </p><p>Cube has fought against many superheroes, some of his adversaries being <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/omni-engine/4005-86997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86997\">Omni-Engine,</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sable/4005-87006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87006\">Sable,</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mink/4005-86994/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86994\">Mink,</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dragonfly/4005-86851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86851\">Dragonfly</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/silver-man/4005-97036/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-97036\">Silver Man.</a> The latter Silver Man also falling in action, the brutal Cube murdering him, causing his reputation to be even lower in the eyes of the heroes. This action also lead to Cube being imprisoned in the Joseph Sanitarium also known as The Hole. Cube is affiliated with the Final Five and Wall of Death. </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Cube is a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/boom-studios/4010-1868/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1868\">Boom! Studios</a> published character that first appears in the 2012 series Deathmatch, appearing in its debut issue <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/deathmatch-1/4000-374684/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-374684\">Deathmatch #1.</a> Cube is designed and created by writer Paul Jenkins and artists Carlos Magno and Michael Garland, writers and artists of the series. </p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>The Cube serves as one of the main antagonists in the Boom! Studios Deathmatch series. Despite the nature of the series pitting all the characters against each other, Cube is one of the characters presented as being universally reviled and he earns the disgust of many of the characters because of his demented and vile persona and actions. The character also serves as a direct contrast to Dragonfly, a young hero who Cube holds a constant grudge against after being defeated by the hero. Cube would often attempt to rile up Dragonfly, reminding him of heroes he had killed, civilians he had killed and making misogynistic comments about <a href=\"/lightspeed/4005-86926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86926\">Lightspeed.</a> Throughout the series the eventual showdown and confrontation between Cube and Dragonfly is cultured. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Deathmatch</h3><p>Cube is one of many and numerous superheroes, supervillains and neutrals abducted under mysterious circumstance and imprisoned in a supermassive enclosed structure, with no immediate reason. Thirty two in total, they have no memories of how they got to this location, who put them there, or who is affecting their powers and memories. The assorted group are being forced to fight systematically in a series of one on one death matches in which only one can survive before moving on. Mysterious and powerful guards composed of light also keep order and hostilities to a minimum between the diverse group, neutralizing any that might start physical fights that take place outside the death matches. The first death match was between Cube's arch-nemesis Dragonfly and Apex with Dragonfly the victor. Dragonfly would also reveal his true identify during the bout and break one of his fundamental principles in killing. This was not something the Cube would neglect to bring up when Dragonfly returned from his death match, taunting Dragonfly with his real life name of Benny Boatright and nicknaming him as Benny, then threatening to kill everyone he knows. Cube would attempt to attack Dragonfly but be quickly neutralized by the powerful light guards as Dragonfly walked away. Cube would continue to threaten him regardless. </p><h3>The Next Deathmatch</h3><p>The next death matches would come thick and fast with Dog 54-Alpha killed by George Truman, Omni-Engine killing Supercollider and Sol Invictus killing Replic 8. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Cube aka The Nematocyst and The Cubozoan Killer after being mutated by a serum he believed to be an anti toxin to the potent and deadly poisons of the cube jellyfish, gains superhuman abilities. His physique changed he is deformed by has enhanced durability and strength but the biggest change in his physiology is his ability to produce and discharge multiple lengthly tendrils that are houses within his body when not being used. Much like the tendrils and stingers of a jellyfish, Cube's glow and are translucent and could almost be described as beautiful save for its horrific ability to poison, kill and disfigure opponents. Cube can produce these tendrils from multiple points of his body but the most deadly and poisonous appear to be those he manifests from behind his face which can open up like a flower producing rows of deadly toxic limbs. Cube's toxins and poison are also said to be at least 50 times that of a box jellyfish. Cube also appears to actively work towards further mutations and increasing his potency. </p><p>Another unusual ability Cube appears to have is to shed his skin into a melting soup of toxins. This excess body shell is also highly toxic and can disfigure and scar any who come into contact with it. </p>",

At some point in the past, the United States would experience a long term power outage which would reach crisis levels. Teagan and Franklin would use their research and knowledge to discover a means and energy source that would not only solve the current power outage but create the means for free, clean global energy for all. Unfortunately agents of a sector in the US government would attempt to kill Teagan and Franklin and steal the research for their own use. They murdered Franklin and left Teagan on deaths doorstep surrounded by fire. As chance would have it, the inferno would burn and be the catalyst for an explosion of the energy source the two professors were going to use for renewable energy and its consequent discharge imbued Teagan with super human electricity wielding powers and abilities. She would go on to become a superhero dubbing herself Electronika.</p><p>Despite holding a negative view towards the US government because of their role in the murder of her husband, Elektronika has still proven to be a hero, having served as a member of the Protectors of Earth. Her villains are the US Government, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/professor-h-higgins/4005-86998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86998\">Hieronymus Higgens</a> and the Choir Boy.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Electronika is a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/boom-studios/4010-1868/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1868\">Boom! Studios</a> published character that first appears in the 2012 series <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/deathmatch/4050-55061/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-55061\">Deathmatch,</a> appearing in its debut issue <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/deathmatch-1/4000-374684/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-374684\">Deathmatch #1.</a> Electronika is designed and created by writer <a href=\"/paul-jenkins/4040-41631/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41631\">Paul Jenkins</a> and artists Carlos Magno and Michael Garland, writers and artists of the series.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Electronika is one of the first casualties and victims in the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/boom-studios/4010-1868/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1868\">Boom! Studios</a> Deathmatch series. Appearing in a handful of issues, we know sparse details about the character, other than that they seemed quite sympathetic towards <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/nephilim/4005-86996/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86996\">Nephilim.</a></p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Deathmatch</h3><p>Electronika after being exposed to a bright light is consequently imprisoned within a enclosed complex trapped with a large number of other superheroes, all sharing similar experience and confusion over the nature of their abduction. They have no idea how they got there, where they are, or who is keeping them restricted. Electronika like the rest of the captive heroes witnesses the first death match between the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dragonfly/4005-86851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86851\">Dragonfly</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/apex/4005-86900/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86900\">Apex,</a> where Dragonfly emerges as the victor, albeit after betraying principles he holds sacred. Electronika is eventually pitted in a death match with the super strong and powerful Nephilim, who she has a special bond with. A superhero witnessing the soon to be confrontation even skeptical about whether Electronika would harm Nephilim as they had served side by side in battle and that she loved him. The battle would begin with Electronika blasting Nephilim with charged electricity which seems to harm the gentle giant. She reminisces over the occasion Nephilim offered her hand picked flowers. Despite shocking Nephilim over and over the beast won't fall down and in a violent and vicious flurry pounds his fists into the fragile professor. The fellow superheroes are shocked as Nephilim kills Electronika.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Electronika is very intelligent, educated and trained university level professor. After being in an accident invoking an unknown and potent new energy source she is imbued with special powers over electricity. Electronika possesses the ability to manipulate, discharge and generate electricity in its various forms. She has a preference for discharging electric pulse spheres and generating static electric webs. The extent of her power would allow her to provide enough energy to keep an entire metropolis running with just her hands and she block and disable various forms of electronic communication.</p>",

    "deck": "Though Lightspeed can move at what appears to be impossible speeds, theoretical physicists now believe she does not move at all; rather, she can cause the Universe to move around her. The staggering implication is that when her powers are active, Melanie Arnold literally becomes the center of the Universe.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Lightspeed also known by her human name Melanie Arnold has a tragic story behind the manifestation of her super powers. Some time ago, Doctor Noxious, a Fear Scientist weaponized and generated a tornado directing it towards San Francisco. This was not an ordinary tornado though, it had been charged with exotic sub atomic particles. A young single pregnant woman was unfortunately caught in its trail of destruction and was killed as a result. Somehow miraculously who unborn daughter survived - Melanie Arnold. In her youth Melanie would start to manifest incredible abilities and powers. It appeared she could phase shift in tandem with the very same particles as the ones she experienced within her mothers accident. This allowed her to move at hyper massive speeds. She would use her powers for good, becoming a superhero dubbing herself Lightspeed. </p><p>Lightspeed is affiliated with the Protectors of the Earth and her reoccurring villains are Doctor Noxious, Senator Vile and the Cannon. </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lightspeed is a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/boom-studios/4010-1868/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1868\">Boom! Studios</a> published character that first appears in the 2012 series Deathmatch, appearing in its debut issue <a href=\"/deathmatch-5/4000-399031/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-399031\">Deathmatch #5.</a> Lightspeed is designed and created by writer <a href=\"/paul-jenkins/4040-41631/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41631\">Paul Jenkins</a> and artists <a href=\"/carlos-magno/4040-44265/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44265\">Carlos Magno</a> and Michael Garland, writers and artists of the series. Lightspeed could be seen as a pastiche of super fast characters such as The Flash and Quicksilver. </p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Lightspeed is a minor supporting character in the Boom! Studios Deathmatch series. The character is used sparsely and is one of the characters that doesn't actually participate in a death match. The character doesn't get much in way of character development or face time, much of what made the character distinguishable ultimately being her powers, and with her origin being detailed in one of the handy back up profiles. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Deathmatch</h3><p>Lightspeed is one of many and numerous superheroes, supervillains and neutrals abducted under mysterious circumstance and imprisoned in a supermassive enclosed structure, with no immediate reason. Thirty two in total, and featuring some of the greatest heroes, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/meridian/4005-86993/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86993\">Meridian,</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sable/4005-87006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87006\">Sable,</a> Dragonfly, Mink, Manchurian, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-rat/4005-87004/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87004\">the Rat</a> and the Mutate and some of the greatest villains in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mister-chuckles/4005-87011/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87011\">Mister Chuckles,</a> Melody Toon, Cube, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/professor-h-higgins/4005-86998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86998\">Hieronymus Higgens.</a> They have no memories of how they got to this location, who put them there, or who is affecting their powers and memories. The assorted group are being forced to fight systematically in a series of one on one death matches in which only one can survive before moving on. Mysterious and powerful guards composed of light also keep order and hostilities to a minimum between the diverse group, neutralizing any that might start physical fights that take place outside the death matches. Lightspeed's first death match round was to be against the mysterious and bizarre <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-glyph/4005-87002/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87002\">Glyph,</a> however after Hieronymus Higgens short circuits the enclosures power, her Meridian and Omni-Engine face off against the Anti Meridian and Lightspeed is killed. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Lightspeed possesses the ability of super speed, able to move at near light speeds, however her powers are more nuanced than that. According to many theories by theoretical physicists, Lightspeed despite appearing as moving near light speeds, hat she may not move at all, rather her abilities have the universe move around her, imitating her moving at such absurd speeds. An incredible consequence of this theory would be that when utilizing her powers Melanie Arnold becomes the center of the universe. Another aspect of Lightspeed's powers is that the more she learns about sub atomic powers the more power and powers she can exhibit. Her powers are said to be derived from her phasing with similar subatomic particles like those in the accident that took her mothers life. Theories also suggest she leeches between dimensions and that she can generate a vibration field. </p>",

Cleared of criminal charges but forced to undergo years of mind numbing counseling, the pain and anger of the abuse were pushed to the dark recesses of his mind, locked away, seemingly for good.</p><p>Over the years Alvin became a father figure to his baby sister Alicia, helping to raise her while his newly single Mother worked two jobs to get by. As an adult Alvin is at best, apathetic. About the only thing that he takes seriously is his Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) training, and his dream of making it to the UFC. That is, until something else steals his focus.</p><p>When Alvin’s 12-year-old sister Alicia is kidnapped, he naturally trusts the police to find her. After a few weeks, the authorities suggest that he and his Mother consider her dead, and move on with their lives. They do. Months later Alicia’s body if found dumped on the side of the road. When the autopsy reveals that she was repeatedly raped and only recently murdered, Alvin detests his initial indifference. As the investigation stalls he slips into a deep, angry, depression.</p><p>With his world crumbling around him, our hero uncovers a clue that could help solve the case. Ignored by police and with more and more time passing, Alvin grows agitated. When he stumbles upon a robbery, Alvin first avoids the conflict. But then, something snaps and he takes matters into his own hands, taking out two attackers by the skin of his teeth. The fear, exhilaration, and pain of the fight seem to awaken him from numbness, and Alvin starts down a road to retribution.</p><p>With no special training, experience, or resources Alvin Gentry takes on what he calls his vigilante project, and sets out to find his sister’s killer. An amateur detective, he struggles to follow the clues and must develop the skills and techniques necessary as he goes. Alvin must learn how to fight on the street, how to shoot, how to protect his identity, and more.</p><p>Along the way he seeks counsel from a local Catholic priest, crosses a street gang with ties to organized crime, and falls in love with his married apartment manager Rebecca. But when Alvin discovers that there is more to his sister’s disappearance than meets the eye, he must take on more than he ever expected, risking it all to save another little girl that is being held by the same man.</p>",

She lives in a home for autistic children in Annapolis. She is the only child who has permanent residence there and spends most her time building imposable structures with her blocks. Due to her connection to the Terranometer, anyone who touches Eleanor can communicate with \"World Computer\". Most people get visions of the future, some can communicate with the World Computer, or access other dimensions. It is still unclear who is sponsoring Eleanor's time at the home, but it is most likely <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" slug=\"shield\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> or the US government, or a charitable foundation called Mindwell.</p><p>Creation</p><p>Eleanor was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42624\" href=\"/jeff-parker/4040-42624/\" slug=\"jeff-parker\">Jeff Parker</a> for his run on <a data-ref-id=\"4050-52884\" href=\"/red-she-hulk/4050-52884/\" slug=\"red-she-hulk\">Red She-Hulk</a></p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Hell Hath No Fury</h3><p>While searching through the Forbidden Forest in New Guinea, Red She-Hulk discovered a ancient temple, while inside she discovered a very old but very advanced computer. The computer took her Big -%#&amp; Sword but informed her the Terrasystem Data Receiver was Eleanor Bennett. Wanting nothing more then her favorite sword back, Red She-Hulk transformed back in to Betty Ross and when searching for Eleanor. She found her in her Annapolis home, but when she questioned her she learned nothing, as Eleanor rarely speaks. But when Betty goes to leave she touches Eleanor and get a vision of the future. This unauthorized use of Eleanor's abilities initiates a trap door and Betty falls into a tunnel, leaving Eleanor to play with her blocks in silence.</p><p>A while later, Betty returns to Eleanor, now with permission for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71711\" href=\"/nikola-tesla/4005-71711/\" slug=\"nikola-tesla\">Nikola Tesla</a>, one of Eleanor's caretakers. Betty touches Eleanor once again and learns the future is worse then before. Betty leaves Eleanor, this time on her own accord but shortly <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7242\" href=\"/machine-man/4005-7242/\" slug=\"machine-man\">Machine Man</a>, who is tracking Red She-Hulk, discovers Eleanor's home. When Machine Man talks to Eleanor, she responses. Once he touches her he is uploaded into the Terranometer and communicates with it.</p><p>When Machine Man is kicked out of the Terranometer, he asks Eleanor to let him back in, but she responds with no, she is too tired. This gives Machine Man the lead he needs and he takes his leave.</p><p>Later when Betty and Machine Man return to Eleanor's home they find it destroyed. The firemen tell them no one was inside. This leaves Betty and Machine Man to wonder if Eleanor was taken to protect her or to keep her powers from them.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Nearly 13,000 years ago, a beast was loose upon the Earth. Some called the beast Tiamat, the mother of beasts. Others called it Kur, the first dragon. It spawned demons across the Mesopotamoan world. According to record, for many years, man was preyed upon like fish in a stream. But then, sometime around 12,000 B.C., a hero rose. A man named Hurin. He taught his people to band together, and fight the abomination. For years, Hurin and his people fought the beast. Until, one day, he devised a plan. He made something called the Iskakku, the great weapon. With the weapon, the beast and his army was defeated. It was as good as dead. Hurin was entrusted to kill the beast. After beating the beast back, Hurin suckled from it and he became its greatest protector. Hurin was then called the Great Traitor, which over time became the Gray Trader.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Gray Trader was created by <a href=\"/american-vampire/4050-32051/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32051\">American Vampire</a> writer <a href=\"/scott-snyder/4040-58926/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-58926\">Scott Snyder</a> and artist <a href=\"/rafael-albuquerque/4040-45269/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-45269\">Rafael Albuquerque</a>, introduced in the final issue before the 2013 hiatus.

    "deck": "After many years in the shadow of Sable, Mink stepped out to pursue a career path of her own. Her relationship with Sable can now best be described as “antagonistic.”",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Mink idolized the crime fighter <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sable/4005-87006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87006\">Sable</a> when she was a little girl, and always wanted to be just like her, beating up bad guys and solving crimes. Mink, also known as Marti-Anne Marten was young when her parents died, and as one consequence she stopped going to Church and went towards a dark period spiraling further downward. As a teenager she would be fall victim to drugs and engage in dangerous sexual behavior/prostitution but eventually she gains the attention of her childhood idol superhero Sable. Sable would take Marti-Anne under her wing and train the teen to become a capable and competent heroine in her own right, with Marti-Anne taking adopting the superhero moniker of Mink. As Mink she would be sidekick and possible successor to Sable, but a falling out would eventually occur between the two woman, and Mink would adopt a antagonist like relationship with her former mentor. Mink would wish to break out on her own terms and take the career path of a solo superhero.</p><p>Mink has been a member of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/second-force/4060-60543/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60543\">Second Force</a> and Strikeforce Seventeen and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/cube/4005-86920/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86920\">Cube</a> and Blowtorch count among her enemies. Mink also had a minor crush on hero <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dragonfly/4005-86851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86851\">Dragonfly</a> and eventually bonded with the hero developing a friendship of sorts.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Mink is a Boom! Studios published character that first appears in the 2012 series Deathmatch, appearing in its debut issue Deathmatch #1. Mink is designed and created by writer Paul Jenkins and artists Carlos Magno and Michael Garland, writers and artists of the series. Mink bears many similarities to DC comics Nightwing character, this is most likely intentional given the nature and idea of Deathmatch.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Mink plays a supporting role in Deathmatch, having ties with Sable and Dragonfly. The character is one of the characters presented as sympathetic and likable, and even flirts with the Dragonfly at times. The characters closeness with Sable also allows her to act as exposition for that character to allow her to retain some of her own mysteriousness.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Deathmatch</h3><p>Mink is transported by mysterious unseen forces to an enclosed complex along with a various assortment of other heroes, villains and vigilantes. Including her former mentor Sable. Neither her or the other heroes or villains understand why they are there or who orchestrated the situation, and they seem powerless and kept in check by powerful guards made of light. The group is forced to watch a death match the first between Dragonfly and Apex in which Dragonfly is the victor and even has his secret identity exposed. Mink who use to have a crush on Dragonfly would flirt with him and eventually befriend him, fielding some of his questions about Sable whom he was curious about. Mink would give a less than positive evaluation of her former mentor, albeit in some senses accurate as far as Sable's coldness and ruthlessness. She would even advise about trying to figure out Sable's real identity. A new series of death match would begin between <a href=\"/supercollider/4005-87468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87468\">Supercollider</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/omni-engine/4005-86997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86997\">Omni-Engine,</a> Amalgam and Shadow Runner and Manchurian and <a href=\"/perpetu-hedron/4005-87010/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87010\">Perpetu-Hedron.</a> Mink would also witness Meridian snap confusingly and murder Berserk, decapitating him with his laser vision.</p><h3>Dragonfly</h3><p>Mink and Dragonfly would appear to get closer and more trusting of each other. Everyone was on edge as a part of being forced into the death matches, and many people were second guessing each other and skeptical of who was keeping secrets. Dragonfly would ask Mink why no one else was bothered by the fact that the hero <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-glyph/4005-87002/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87002\">Glyph</a> was being contained in a large orb, Mink pointing out glibly that everyone is a bit preoccupied with the death matches. She would indulge Dragonfly's theories though and the two would observe Glyph for some sort of clue as to the reason behind the madness of the situation. Thinking that Glyph was trying to attempt communication Dragonfly would propose they get Manchurian to observe Glyph. Mink would suddenly kiss Dragonfly on the lips and compliment his intelligence before heading away. Mink's mentor Sable would participate in her first death match against Professor Hieronymus Higgens,</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Mink possesses incredible fitness, agility, stamina and fighting skill. Mink possesses the ability and skill of a supreme gymnast. She is somewhat stubborn but also has a fierce determination and is principled as far as responsibilities and duties and maintaining both. Mink possesses a resistance to cold. After being trained by Sable, Mink possesses above average fighting skills and ability.</p>",

    "deck": "Nephilim is a peace-loving, gentle giant. But trouble follows him everywhere, and as a result of his alarming appearance he is unloved and unaccepted by humanity. No matter Nephilim’s heroic actions, his intent is generally misconstrued.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Nephilim is the personification of ancient Hebrew lore, a construct born of ancient beliefs that manifested as a creature in what was once the city of Babylon. Trained as a warrior, Nephilim railed against his cruel captors and strove to live a life of peace. But wherever he went, he was attacked and reviled. In his earliest incarnation, Nephilim saved ancient Cairo from the dreaded Homunculus. Nephilim in modern age is a superhero and has served alongside and affiliated with groups such as First Force alongside Warrior Woman, Meridian, Silver Man and Projector and Second Force alongside <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sable/4005-87006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87006\">Sable,</a> Dragonfly, Omni-Engine, Meridian and Warrior Woman. Nephilim's enemies are <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/homunculus/4005-96977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-96977\">Homunculus</a> and Mister Macabre.</p><p>Nephilim is a gentle and kind creature but his appearance often create problems as many people can mistaken him for a monster. Nephilim was especially protective and kind towards the super hero <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/electronika/4005-86922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86922\">Electronika</a>, even once picking flowers for her.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Nephilim is a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/boom-studios/4010-1868/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1868\">Boom! Studios</a> published character that first appears in the 2012 series Deathmatch, appearing in its debut issue <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/deathmatch-1/4000-374684/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-374684\">Deathmatch #1.</a> Nephilim is designed and created by writer <a href=\"/paul-jenkins/4040-41631/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41631\">Paul Jenkins</a> and artists <a href=\"/carlos-magno/4040-44265/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44265\">Carlos Magno</a> and <a href=\"/michael-garland/4040-63761/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-63761\">Michael Garland,</a> writers and artists of the series. Nephilim bears some resemblance to Marvel comics The Hulk, most likely by intent, both are misunderstood gentle giants, both have incredible strength, and both are often vilified for their appearance.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Nephilim acts in a supporting role in Boom! Studios Deathmatch, fulfilling the role of a strong man, and gentle giant. The characters heart is demonstrated to be as strong as his physical strength. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Deathmatch</h3><p>Nephilim is one of the many superheroes locked and contained in a mysterious superstructure. None of the heroes recall or understand how they got there, where they are, who controls the powerful light guards who keep them there or why they are there, save for the knowledge they are being forced to fight each other one on one to the death. Nephilim is eventually pitted in a death match with the intelligent and powerful energy superhero Electronika. The two heroes have a history and bond, often fighting together and both considering the other as a friend. A superhero witnessing the soon to be confrontation even skeptical about whether Electronika would harm Nephilim as they had served side by side in battle and that she loved him. The battle would begin with Electronika blasting Nephilim with charged electricity which seems to harm the gentle giant. Despite shocking Nephilim over and over he won't fall. The super strong creature manages to finally land a hit on the smaller and nimble Electronika then devastates her with his powerful physical attacks. As she pleads beaten, he utters the words \"we have no choice\" as he delivers a devastating punch killing her. The fellow superheroes witnessing the death match are shocked and stunned.</p><h3>Depression</h3><p>Nephilim falls into a depression after the events of his death match where he was forced to kill Electronika, a woman he loved. He would become catatonic and lethargic. Many other death matches would come and go, however in the death match between Sable and Professor Hieronymus Higgens, the Professor would hack the structure giving him limited control over the facility they were in. Not only did this give him an advantage over Sable, it allowed him to power down the complex, shutting off its power, disabling the light guards, and removing the power neutralizers. Nephilim would get targeted by the sadistic and cruel Melody Toon, who aside from her dangerous personality, possesses dangerous levels of power as well, levitating Nephilim and toying with him. Mink and Sol Invictus would arrive to help Nephilim, but Melody would throw him violently against a wall breaking it. Sol Invictus and Mink would threaten Melody to be silent, her powers vocal based, but Melody would send the two heroes flying as well. This brief moment would allow Nephilim to recover and he would smack Melody violently after seeing her hurt Mink and Sol Invictus. The three heroes would try to fight against Melody but the power would be turned back on and the light guards and power neutralizers would quickly reassert order. </p><h3>Deathmatch Against Melody Toons</h3><p>In Nephilim's second death match he would be pitted against the siren of seduction Melody Toon's. Much like there first encounter Melody would take the upper hand, neutralizing Nephilim's massive strength and using her power against him. Nephilim is also still vulnerable after killing Electronika with his own hands and this haunts him. Melody assaults him continuously with powerful sonic attacks, unrelenting and with a sadistic glee. Nephilim would eventually fall to her attacks and fall to his death in a massive explosion. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Nephilim is the strongest creature in existence, with strength perhaps rivaling that of Meridian himself. His strength increases in direct proportion to the fear he creates in others. So against an opponent who fears him, Nephilim cannot be defeated. Nephilim had super durability able to withstand powerful electric attacks.</p>",

Yet he has come close on numerous occasions, most notably when Nihilus Rex ordered the Known Universe to cease existence, an event that precipitated the Chaos Wars. In keeping with his noble stature, he is incapable of knowing love.",

Thrown into exile, the last remaining heir to the Sun, Sol Invictus, grows up believing to be the son of a common Solar Warrior, Dominus Invictus. When he later learns the truth about where he comes from and what his birthright as the Sun Prince is, he reclaims his throne, reunites his people and defeats Nihilus Rex just as their protective dome is destroyed. Dominus sacrifices himself to save the life of his adopted and only son, and as a result, Sol is cast down to Earth in the resulting explosion.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>Sol Invictus was brought up to never accept defeat and has been trained to be a ruthless and mighty warrior. He draws most of his powers from the sun's solar rays as well as other radioactive elements to create nuclear fission between his fists. He is immortal as long as there is a sun to sustain power from.</p><h3>Known Enemies</h3><p>Nihilus Rex, The Countess, Professor Hieronymus Higgins, The Br'kytt Conglomerate</p><h3>Affiliations</h3><p>Sol-Army, Protectors of Earth</p><h2>Deathmatch</h2><p>Sol Invictus along with all of Earth's greatest heroes and villains wake to find themselves imprisoned in an unknown high-tech facility where they are forced to fight to the death against their will.

She is a superhero crime fighting detective and appears extremely competent and incredibly intelligent able to solve problems and mysteries with relative proficiency and thoroughness. What is known about Sable, is that she first became active after the actions of the sociopath killer <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mister-chuckles/4005-87011/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87011\">Mister Chuckles</a> which resulted in the deaths of a bus full of passengers. Sable was able to identify and follow Mister Chuckles as the perpetrator despite a lack of solid evidence. Sable's ability to plan and combat crime is so efficient that many have speculated that she is actually a psychic or telepath. Whether or not this is true is unknown, but regardless aside from that Sable is a prime example of human physical fitness, ability and skill, with uncanny intuitive ability, extreme resilience and durability, and she is aided by many various gadgets and devices. Aside from Mister Chuckles, she also has run ins with other villains, most frequently <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/melody-toon/4005-87007/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87007\">Melody Toon</a> and the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/cube/4005-86920/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86920\">Cube.</a></p><p>Sable has served in many superhero teams, such as Protectors of Earth and the Gateway Army and alongside <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/meridian/4005-86993/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86993\">Meridian,</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/nephilim/4005-86996/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86996\">Nephilim,</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dragonfly/4005-86851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86851\">Dragonfly,</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/omni-engine/4005-86997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86997\">Omni-Engine</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/warrior-woman/4005-96976/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-96976\">Warrior Woman</a> in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/second-force/4060-60543/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60543\">Second Force.</a></p><p>She has trained and had a protégée in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mink/4005-86994/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86994\">Mink</a> after finding the young girl Marti-Anne Marten as a teenager struggling with drug abuse and prostitution, Sable would step in and help her find her feet. Although Sable would help Marti-Anne Martin recuperate and grow into a competent and skilled superhero as Mink, the two would eventually reach and impasse and have a falling out, with Mink deciding to break out on her own, and trying her hand as a solo hero.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Sable is a Boom! Studios published character that first appears in the 2012 series Deathmatch, appearing in its debut issue Deathmatch #1. Sable is designed and created by writer Paul Jenkins and artists Carlos Magno and Michael Garland, writers and artists of the series. Sable bears many similarities to DC comics Batman character, this is most likely intentional given the nature and idea of Deathmatch.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Sable is presented as the intelligent reserved and calculating detective hero in Deathmatch, drawing on many of the traits of the detective archetype that many other detective characters tend to, including Batman, Sherlock Holmes and Constantine. This is reenforce throughout the series with references to the character as cold, cunning and heartless, not by her enemies, but actually her closest confidantes and team mates. Sable in her parallel to DC comics Batman also is paralleled with Batman's symbolic adversarial relationship with the jester character Joker, with Mister Chuckles serving as Sable's Joker.</p><p>Sable alongside Dragonfly serve as two of the more major characters in the series, appearing more than any other characters and with much of story seen through their eyes and perspectives.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Deathmatch</h3><p>Sable finds herself imprisoned within a enclosed complex trapped with a large number of other superheroes, all sharing similar experience and confusion over the nature of their abduction. They have no idea how they got there, where they are, or who is keeping them restricted. They know that that some figure or entity is also somehow forcing them to engage in lethal one on one combat with other each other and that this is being broadcast to the other heroes not participating. They are all also aware they are being systemically pitted against each other and that something is affecting their memories and personalities at times. There are also powerful light guards that restrict physical hostility unless its as a part of the death matches. After Dragonfly's death match with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/apex/4005-86900/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86900\">Apex</a> is over, Sable approaches him. Sable questions him as she intends to try and unsolved the mysteries they are confronted with, even complimenting Dragonfly on how well he kept his anonymity despite her efforts to identify his civilian persona. Sable is sympathetic for what Dragonfly has experienced but also tries to steer the conversation towards identifying the threats and problems they face and the most effective and efficient solution to implement. During the second death match between the heroes, this time Electronika versus Nephilim, Sable is sneaking around the complex. As Nephilim deals the final death blow to his long time ally, Sable comes across the Rat who has just killed one of the light guards.</p><h3>Great Minds</h3><p>Sable and the Rat observe and analyze the dead light guards body questioning and theorizing the nature of them. Despite some of his strange verbal mannerisms, The Rat makes some valid observations and requests Sable to use her detective skills. Sable notes that its comprised of semi translucent material, and theorizes its nano robotics or nano mites, and that its cold to the touch and frictionless. She continues to state the level of technology is highly advanced, more so than anything she has ever seen. That it can't be carbon based, possibly silicone but that she would need more tools and equipment to know for sure. The body of the dead light guard would start to become unbalanced which would draw the attention of the rest of the light guards. The Rat would tell Sable to strike him to help cover their actions, and she would comply then tell the rest of the light guard the incapacitated light guard was an accident. They would seem to believe her leaving her to integrate with the other superheroes and drag the Rat away.</p><h3>More Deathmatch's</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3586214-saaaabbg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3586214\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.4482390608324\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3586214-saaaabbg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3586214\"><img alt=\"Sable and Chuckles\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55328/3586214-saaaabbg.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/3586214-saaaabbg.jpg 937w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55328/3586214-saaaabbg.jpg 662w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/55328/3586214-saaaabbg.jpg 441w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" data-width=\"441\"></a><figcaption>Sable and Chuckles</figcaption></figure><p>Sable would sit and discuss what happened with Dragonfly where they would continue trying to figure out the situation with Sable still motivated to getting out of there. The next death match would start, this new battle between <a href=\"/monkey/4005-86995/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86995\">Monkey</a> and the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/cube/4005-86920/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86920\">Cube</a> with Sable paying close attention. Cube would end up the victor, killing Monkey brutally with his toxins, and Dragonfly still curious about Sable would talk to Mink, a superhero that use to train under Sable and presumably knew her well. Mink would describe Sable as stone cold and that he was better off not knowing. More death matches would take place with Omni-Engine killing Supercollider, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sol-invictus/4005-87000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87000\">Sol Invictus</a> killing <a href=\"/replic-8/4005-86999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86999\">Replic 8</a>, and George Truman killing Dog 54 Alpha. Sable would make her way to find her arch nemesis Mister Chuckles, insisting he convince her this wasn't all his doing or game. She would threaten him with dismemberment if he was the cause of this senseless violence, with Chuckles insisting that it was beyond his means.</p><p>Sable would continue to threaten him with violence with Chuckles removing his mask to reveal a scarred visage and pointing out that he likes dogs, and that he saw Dog 54 put to death. Talk of a temporarily alliance was mentioned but dismissed, both Sable and Chuckles aware they would eventually put against each other, Chuckles making sure to tell Sable he knows he is going to enjoy killing her.</p><h3>Intelligentsia</h3><p>Sable would report back to the rest of the heroes explaining that it wasn't Chuckles. This would lead to a small argument amongst the group resulting in a shocking turn when Meridian would kill Berserk with his laser vision. After the incident with Meridian, all the participants of the death matches would be on edge and attempting to find out what was happening. Sable would convene with Manchurian, George Truman, the Rat and Dragonfly, and talk would turn to discussion of the Intelligentsia. Only Manchurian and Sable would find that name familiar with Manchurian filling in details for the others, speaking of a powerful organization behind the scenes, behind the shadows secretly controlling unfathomable amounts of finance and power and wielding incredible influence and ability. Manchurian would even explain how he almost was killed by even learning of their existence, Sable would affirm Manchurians claims with her own experience of uncovering them a few years after Manchurian, both proposing the idea that the Intelligentsia's potential role in the death matches, although Sable is skeptical.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Sable possesses no superhuman abilities or powers. In spite of that she is considered one of the most capable, proven and effective crime fighters. To such an extent and point that some suspect and accuse her of actually having super powers, in the realms of super powered precognition or intuition. Whether true or false Sable's intuition and deductive reasoning are very acute and extraordinary. Her fitness levels, stamina, durability, physique, resilience, mental toughness, fighting ability are all above average and in the upper echelons of human ability. Her strength and fitness level is comparable to a highly trained gymnast and she has mastered numerous fighting styles. Sable is also aided by various gadgets and devices, that allow her greater maneuverability, the ability to scale heights, as well as for offense and defense purposes. Sable is outfitted in a battle suit and keeps her identify masked at all times.</p>",

    "deck": "Melody Toon is a true sociopath who exists only to destroy. Her legendary cruelty is unparalleled, while the perfection of her voice simply acts as a lure to unsuspecting victims.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Melody Toon also known as Melody Masters also referred to colloquially as the Siren of Seduction, possesses a seductive personalty, and an incredible and harmonic singing voice. The femme fatale unfortunately also possessed many flawed character qualities, jealous, vindictive, bitter and cruel, she is also psychologically damaged and prone to lashing out and targeting others for harm. Rather than seek her goals with her natural talents, she turned to crime and petty behavior towards others, and with her super powered abilities, she would kill or harm those she felt were competing with her, or more beautiful or talented. Her voice could also manipulate and lure in others as well as compel people to have suicidal thoughts and urges. Her voice is said to be so unique and incredible that once heard it can not be forgotten. Melody Toon's enemies include the crime fighter <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sable/4005-87006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87006\">Sable,</a> the Gateway Army and all of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/first-force/4060-60542/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60542\">First Force,</a> who consist of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/meridian/4005-86993/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86993\">Meridian,</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/nephilim/4005-86996/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86996\">Nephilim,</a> <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/warrior-woman/4005-96976/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-96976\">Warrior Woman,</a> Silver Man, and Projector. Melody also seems to have a strong dislike of Sable's apprentice <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mink/4005-86994/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86994\">Mink. </a></p><p>Melody Toon generally doesn't have any allies and almost balks at the idea when it sounds like <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/professor-h-higgins/4005-86998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86998\">Professor Hieronymus Higgens</a> suggests it. Melody once also had a romantic relationship with the Manchurian although it ended very badly with Melody holding over a lot of bitterness and resentment towards the worlds most intelligent man.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Melody Toon is a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/boom-studios/4010-1868/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1868\">Boom! Studios</a> published character that first appears in the 2012 series Deathmatch, appearing in its debut issue <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/deathmatch-1/4000-374684/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-374684\">Deathmatch #1.</a> Melody Toon is designed and created by writer Paul Jenkins and artists Carlos Magno and Michael Garland, writers and artists of the series.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Melody Toon is one of the main antagonists in the Deathmatch comic series by Boom! Studios, appearing in the majority of the issues and being presented with a cruel and psychopathic personality. The character is crude and insulting, producing a lot of verbal barbs towards the more traditional heroic characters. Her powers could draw parallels to characters such as Black Canary, Siryn and Banshee. Melody develops a rivalry and antagonistic relationship with Mink.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Deathmatch</h3><p>Melody Toon is one of the numerous superheroes, supervillains and neutrals abducted under mysterious circumstance and imprisoned in a supermassive enclosed structure, with no apparent reason. Thirty two in total, they have no memories of how they got to this location, who put them there, or who is affecting their powers and memories. Even more so Melody and her allies and enemies are being forced to fight systematically in a series of one on one death matches in which only one can survive before moving on. Mysterious and powerful guards composed of light also keep order and hostilities to a minimum between the diverse group, neutralizing any that might start physical fights that take place outside the death matches. The first death match was between Dragonfly and Apex with Dragonfly the victor, followed by Dog 54-Alpha and George Truman, Omni-Engine killing Supercollider and Sol Invictus killing Replic 8. Melody's first match is the last to take place, so it gives her more time available than most of the other combatants. Professor Hieronymus Higgens suggests that they should form a temporary alliance with the heroes, given that he doubts he could perform against a participant like the Meridian. Melody questions whether he would want to go against her to which the Professor declines.</p><h3>Power Outage</h3><p>Before she could even participate in her first death match, the Siren of Seduction Melody would get a chance to wreak havoc when the power to the facility imprisoning them all is cut off by the actions of Hieronymus Higgens during his death match with Sable. With no light guards to stop them or none of their powers nullified, Melody goes on a rampage and decides to attack and victimize the gentle giant Nephilim. Using her powers she is able to levitate him and hold him in place, but she is interrupted by Mink and Sol Invictus. She casually tosses Nephilim away and starts to mock and patronize Mink and Sol Invictus, taunting and teasing both before sending them flying with her vocal talents. Melody is caught off guard when a recovered Nephilim attacks her sending her flying. She would recover and renew her attacks just time against all three. In the mean time Manchurian would have fixed the problems preventing the power to be on, and the facility's defenses and light guards would be reinstalled and the power nullifies would also be powered on and all infighting would be ceased and order would be applied.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Melody Toon possesses sonic based vocal powers to the extent she can perform a number of specialized effects with them. Melodies voice can be used to manipulate others psyche and mental state, and can be used as a lure to bait people, or compel others to have suicidal thoughts. Her voice can induce manic craze and madness, and it can be used as a sheer physical projectile force that can knock even powerful beings off there feet. Her powers can levitate and hold others as well as demonstrated against the physical robust and power Nephilim. Melody can use her powers to create internal hemorrhaging as well if desired. Melody's voice is said to be so unique and incredible that once heard it can not be forgotten.</p>",

Lacking success Mister Chuckles would fall and instead resort to villainy and chaotic acts of violence and manipulation. Now a criminal or even super villain Chuckles misdeeds would become legendary and one such incident would involve the slaughter of a bus full of passengers.

Mister Chuckles is a pastiche and parallel to DC comics Joker character and many other characters that use black humor and comedy alongside committing horrid acts of violence and notoriety. This is most likely intentional given the nature and idea of Deathmatch.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Mister Chuckles is a clown like character and the main foil of the Sable character, imitating the Batman and Joker dynamic that exists in the DC comics universe and many of Batman's stories. he character is presented as being both simultaneously methodical and crazy, and as serving as a balance with Sable, one that almost seems like a need, a yin and yang relationship. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Deathmatch</h3><p>Mister Chuckles finds himself locked and imprisoned within an unknown and mysterious super structure along with 32 other individuals, a combination of superheroes and super villains, some allies and one of his biggest nemesis, the mysterious crime fighter Sable. All the individuals are clueless and confused to their newfound circumstance, with power and memory tampering an issue and powerful light based guards restricting hostile interaction save for the death matches. The forced one on one lethal death matches that all the participated are being forced to take a part in. The first death match is between <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dragonfly/4005-86851/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86851\">Dragonfly</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/apex/4005-86900/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86900\">Apex</a>. with more death matches quick to follow, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dog-54-alpha/4005-86921/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86921\">Dog 54-Alpha</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/george-truman/4005-86924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86924\">George Truman,</a> with Truman the victor, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/omni-engine/4005-86997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86997\">Omni-Engine</a> killing <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/supercollider/4005-87468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87468\">Supercollider,</a> Sol Invictus killing Replic 8. Mister Chuckle's nemesis Sable approaches the clown during the frequent breaks between the death matches. She would insist he convince her this wasn't all his doing or game. She would threaten him with dismemberment if he was the cause of this senseless violence, with Chuckles insisting that it was beyond his means. Sable would continue to threaten him with violence with Chuckles removing his mask to reveal a scarred visage and pointing out that he likes dogs, and that he saw Dog 54-Alpha put to death. Talk of a temporarily alliance was mentioned but dismissed, both Sable and Chuckles aware they would eventually put against each other, Chuckles making sure to tell Sable he knows he is going to enjoy killing her. Sable would report back to the rest of the heroes explaining that it wasn't Chuckles.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Mister Chuckles possesses no superhuman abilities or powers, but in spite of that is one of the most feared and dangerous people on the planet, due to a combination of his extreme patience, greater than average intelligence and a gifted ability to manipulate. Although many believe that Mister Chuckles is clinically insane and recklessly deranged, the reality is Mister Chuckle's is a master planner who takes many precautions and measures to execute his crimes. Sometimes the clowns plans and machinations would take place over several years. Most recently Mister Chuckles has started to use technology and the prevalence of social media and social sharing to accommodate his plans, seeing it as another tool in his arsenal to inflict terrorism across the globe and commit further crimes. Chuckles can also use many different types of weapons and disguises to various effect.</p>",
