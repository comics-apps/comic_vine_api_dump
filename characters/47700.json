    "description": "<p>Little is known about the American Champion. He was a member of Capes Inc. and appeared to be an \"aging hippie\" with a patriotic streak. American Champion had a very liberal, open, and \"adventurous\" relationship with his Capes Inc. teammate Claire Voyant. It is unclear if they were married, but they did live together in a mansion, suggesting that the American Champion may have been wealthy.  <br/> <br/>When the Chronodile emerged from the time stream to attack the United States, Capes Inc., responded to the challenge. American Champion was dropped into the fray but was grabbed up by the giant villain. Chronodile held American Champion in his claws and tossed him into his jaws, snapping down and cleaving the hero in half. American Champion fell to the earth, torn into two pieces at the waist.  <br/> <br/>After the Chronodile was defeated, Capes inc., held a funeral for him and two other fallen heroes. Days later, the hyper sexual Claire Voyant slept with Captain Cosmic to help get over her grief. She felt that American Champion would have approved. </p>",

    "deck": "Desmond is the protagonist in the Assassin's Creed video game series. He was abducted by Abstergo Industries and became an assassin to fight against the templars.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Desmond Miles was born in one of the Assassin Order's hideouts in the desert known as \"The Farm\" an off-the-grid compound with a population of about thirty people. Though he was destined to be trained as an Assassin, he was frustrated by his parents' explicit instructions not to leave the compound, and believed them to be overly concerned and paranoid. On his 16th birthday, he finally fled, wanting \"to see the rest of the world.\"</p><p>After leaving the Assassin compound, he went into hiding for nine years. While keeping a low profile, he eventually became a bartender. Aware of the Templars, and wanting to avoid both them and the Assassins, Desmond never used his real name and used only cash to purchase items. However, he was eventually found, traced through a fingerprint needed for a motorcycle license, and was kidnapped to be brought to an <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58032\" href=\"/abstergo-industries/4060-58032/\">Abstergo</a> facility in Italy</p><h2>Bio</h2><h3>Assassin's Creed</h3><p>Desmond is forced into Abstergo's Animus, a machine that allows him to relive the memories of his ancestors stored in his DNA, by scientists Dr. Warren Vidic and Dr. Lucy Stillman, employees of Abstergo Corporation. They explain that they are searching the memories of Desmond's ancestors, specifically <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75367\" href=\"/altair-ibn-laahad/4005-75367/\">Altaïr ibn La-Ahad</a>, for a certain piece of information, which they refuse to disclose. Desmond agrees and put into the Animus. Later on, after recovering the information for which Vidic was searching, Abstergo's executives order Desmond killed; Lucy's quick thinking saves him, and she persuades Vidic to keep him alive until they know for certain that he's of no further use. Upon returning to his room, Desmond discovers that the Bleeding Effect has given him Altair's 'Eagle Vision', allowing him to discern friend from foe and read cryptic messages left on the walls and floor by Subject 16, another Animus subject.</p><h3>Assassin's Creed II</h3><p>Desmond escapes from Abstergo with the help of Lucy, Who was revealed to be an undercover Assassin. Shortly afterwards,Desmond is taken to Lucy's Assassin's hideout, and he goes into another Animus, supervised by Lucy and her team, consisting of Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane, in order to be quickly trained as an Assassin via the bleeding effect. This time, he goes into the memories of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75368\" href=\"/ezio-auditore-da-firenze/4005-75368/\">Ezio Auditore da Firenze</a>, an ancestor from the Renaissance.</p><p>After successfully navigating Ezio's early memories (with help from Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane monitoring him), Desmond is extracted from the Animus to avoid the mental degradation that Subject 16 suffered as a side-effect of the Bleeding Effect. Shortly after extraction, Desmond flashes back to one of Altaïr's memories, despite not being linked to the Animus. Here, Desmond learns of Altaïr having a lover, Maria, a Templar used as decoy by Robert de Sable. As Altaïr leaves, Desmond wonders why he isn't following the Assassin; instead, he moves towards Maria, where he enters her womb, showing that Altaïr's child (and another of Desmond's ancestors) has just been conceived.</p><p>After spending more time in the Animus 2.0, Desmond begins to adjust to his newly developed skills, becoming highly agile and an expert in whatever weapons Ezio learned to use. The last segment of Ezio's memories brings an astonished Ezio (and by extension, Desmond) to a futuristic chamber underneath the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56020\" href=\"/vatican-city/4020-56020/\">Vatican</a>, where a goddess, Minerva, addresses Desmond by name and, through Ezio, warns him of an impending cataclysm that has the potential to destroy all life on Earth. Desmond is pulled from the Animus quickly afterward, after Abstergo discover their hideout. The team escape, Desmond using the skills acquired from the bleeding effect to help fight off Abstergo's forces. Desmond enters the Animus while in transit, knowing that Ezio or perhaps Subject 16, may have the answers they seek.</p><h3>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</h3><p>Two weeks have passed and Desmond, Lucy, Shaun and Rebecca arrive at Monteriggioni, where Villa Auditore was located. They set up a safe house in the Villa's sanctuary, and Desmond re-enters the Animus, in order to discover the location of the Apple of Eden, an artifact obtained by Ezio and one of the \"Pieces of Eden\". After finding the location of the Apple through the Animus, Desmond and the others learn that the Apple is hidden under the Colosseum. The assassins find a way inside an ancient Vault, where the Apple is located. He then takes the Apple and Juno begins to talk to Desmond and takes control of his body and forces him to stab Lucy for reasons which are unclear. After Desmond passes out, he gets put back into the Animus by William Miles and an unknown man, who are assassins. The events and assignments for the assassins seem to end after this and Desmond falls into a coma.</p><h3>Assassin's Creed: Revelations</h3><p>After Stabbing Lucy, Desmond Fades into a Coma and is plugged into the black room to keep him alive and find a way out. Upon waking up, he finds Subject 16 in the black room, telling him he must explore his ancestors remaining memories and separate all of his ancestors memories from his own to be able to survive, Desmond Explores Ezio's days in Constantinople, talking with Subject 16 along the way, soon when the animus tries to delete Desmond, Subject 16 sacrifices himself for Desmond so he can save himself. Desmond achieves the Sync Nexus, receiving a message from Ezio and the first civilisation telling him to go to the Grand Temple. Desmond then wakes up from his coma, saying he knows what they need to do.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Desmond Holds a serious view on life due to being raised as an Assassin since birth and not getting to see the rest of the world, after escaping the farm, Desmond goes incognito for a while, showing his skills at avoiding detection, he is eventually caught by a motorcycle license. Desmond however occasionally makes jokes to both friends and enemies. After escaping abstergo, Desmond became more relaxed around friends and became more humorous and flirtatious, however after discovering the bleeding effect, he became worried for his sanity.</p>",

    "deck": "Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad (1165 – 1257) was a Syrian-born member of the Levantine Brotherhood of Assassins, and served as their Mentor from 1191 until his death in 1257. During his tenure as Mentor.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Altair Ibn-La'Ahad was born in 1165 AD, his mother was a Christian and his father was a Muslim; both were assassins. During the course of his childhood he learned the to hone the skills and techniques of the Assassins from the Al Mualim, the Grand Master of The Assassin Order and the greatest assassin of his time until Altair. He quickly rose through the ranks, gained respect from brethren, and became a teacher to new assassins and was given rank of Master Assassin. Al Mualim as a teacher was strict adherent to the rules of the order and believed that love made the Assassins weaker and had Altair's parents never show him love or kindness in order to strengthen him. Even in their deaths Altair showed no grief and said that their deaths felt like \"The passing of two strangers\". Even though Al Mualim never showed compassion or love to Altair he always felt that he seemed more like a father to him than his real one ever did.</p><p>In 1190 Altair rose to the rank of Master Assassin as the assassins were preparing the impending arrival of The Third Crusade, during that time he was tasked with retrieving an artifact called The Chalice. To complete the task he would have to retrieve three keys that belonged to three Templars. He began on the quest while defending the city of Acre, Syria and uncovering the identity of the traitor who sold the Assassins out to the Knights Templar. On his travels he was surprised to see an old associative of his-Adha, he was even more surprised when she revealed that she was The Chalice he was seeking. She was kidnapped by Lord Basilisk, a Templar who took her to the port of Tyre. Altair made his way to Tyre, killing Basilisk while he was there but as he searched Basilisk's boat Adha was nowhere to be found, It would be years before Altair would fin Adha again only when he did he was too late.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Altair at first was a cold assassin but developed into more a philosopher or Monk like in his later years. He started a family, wrote the codex pages detailing new assassination techniques and new weapons.Following the death of Al Mualim, Altair was named Grand Master of the Assassin Order;under Altair's leadership the Order would become more secretive, no longer operating in the public eye. he began work on the Codex pages, a story of his life and adventures. The crusades however disrupted those plans as The Templar order had not still not been defeated despite losing many of their top men.They were now under the leadership of Armand Bouchart and fled to Cyprus. Leading an attack on Acre, Altair saved the life of de Sable's decoy, she had been abandoned by Bouchart. She revealed her name to be Maria and she joined Altair on his quest after deciding that the Templar's actions were unjust. The two grew closer, and impossibly fell in love. After liberating Cyprus from Templar control, he decided to the Apple with him in order to study it. He learned much from it, writing much of it in his codex. He learned of new assassination techniques, new technology, and of the mysterious civilization known as Those who Came Before. Altair and Maria had two sons, both were trained in the ways of the Assassins, during this time Asia was being conquered by a man called Tamujin or as he was more commonly known Genghis Khan. Altair suspected he he was in possession of a Piece of Eden and together he and his family headed east to stop Khan from conquering the rest of the world.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span>Changing the Order</span></h3><p>Liberating Cyprus from Bouchart and his Templar followers, Altaïr, who had previously intended to seal the Apple within the Limassol archives, decided it best that the Apple remain with him, and over the following years, he peered into it quite often.</p><p>In 1193, Altaïr and Maria married in Limassol, Cyprus, out of respect to the Cypriots for offering the island as a base to the Assassins. Among the guests of honor was Markos. Upon returning to Masyaf, their first son Darim was born. Around 1204, Altaïr personally began to promote the way of the Assassin Order in various cities and regions. However, this came to an end when he made an attempt to do so in Constantinople, as the Fourth Crusade was causing chaos among the population, thus forcing Altaïr to retreat.</p><p>By studying the Apple of Eden, Altaïr gained the knowledge to create a form of metal that was lighter and stronger than any other metal known until then. He created an armor set for himself, but decided to erase the formula to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Contrary to what his former mentor strived for, Altaïr allowed the members of the Order to express love for their children.</p><p>While Al Mualim believed that love would make them weaker, Altaïr thought that love would make it easier for them to make sacrifices for the right cause. With the usage of the Apple \"in small doses, and with a focused mind,\" Altaïr gained the knowledge to once again redesign the hidden blade so that it could contain an additional device capable of launching small projectiles.</p><h3><span>Fall from grace</span></h3><h4><span>Journey to Mongolia</span></h4><p>In 1217, Genghis Khan rapidly approached from the east, and was preventing the Assassin Order's progression. Altaïr also suspected that he possessed a Piece of Eden. Thus, Altaïr, Maria and Darim, who was an accomplished crossbowman, left for Mongolia. Their son Sef was left behind to take care of his wife and two children, and Malik was placed in temporary control of the Order.</p><p>In Mongolia, they liased with the Assassin Qulan Gal, and the four of them traveled to near Xing-ging in Xu province, which was being besieged by the Mongols. Darim found a vantage point to look over the Mongol encampment, disposing of any guard who might notice them, while Altaïr and Qulan Gal infiltrated the camp. However, Altaïr had lost some of his stealth in his old age, and was detected by a guard.</p><p>The guard was able to wound Altaïr, but he was killed by Qulan Gal before he could raise the alarm. Qulan Gal managed to bring Altaïr out of the camp to safety, thus saving his life. Qulan Gal and Darim proceeded to formulate a plan to flush Khan out of his tent. After realizing the danger, Khan tried to escape on horseback, but his horse was quickly shot by Qulan Gal. Right afterwards, Khan himself was finished by a shot of Darim's crossbow. Successful, the family headed back home, ten years after they had left Masyaf.</p><h4><span>Return to Masyaf</span></h4><p>When they arrived in Masyaf, in 1228, they were greeted by Swami, a former apprentice who was only eager to fight. Altaïr asked the man why he had not been greeted by Rauf as he had requested in his letters, but Swami explained that Rauf had died of fever during his absence. Swami also explained that Malik had been thrown into prison, and that without anyone to lead the Order, a council had been formed; with Abbas Sofian at its head. Altaïr and Maria, not trusting the situation, asked where Sef was, to which Swami responded that he had fled to Alamut.</p><p>Darim thus headed off for Alamut to retrieve his brother. Altaïr and Maria continued onwards towards the castle, where they found it half-abandoned, stripped of the life it had had under Altaïr's rule. They were directed to a room in the right wing of the castle, despite Altaïr expecting his residence to be in the Master's tower. The next day, they went to the Master's tower to meet the council, but were intercepted by Swami half-way through to lead them the rest of the way himself. Arriving there, Altaïr saw that the council consisted of the most-weak minded of the Order.</p><p>Abbas had puppeteered the whole council in his favor. Altaïr told the council of their travels in Mongolia, after which Abbas explained what had happened to Sef. He claimed that Sef had been killed by Malik, after Sef supposedly found out about Malik wanting to keep control of the Order for himself. Altaïr, furious, demanded that control of the Order be returned to him, as the Creed would decree it. Abbas, with a smile on his face, replied that the Creed no longer did.</p><h4><span>Finding the truth</span></h4><p>Altaïr and Maria returned to their residence, where Altaïr began reflecting on the pain he had caused Malik in his life. Maria managed to persuade him that Malik would never betray him, and thus Altaïr decided to infiltrate the prison in Masyaf's dungeon. He evaded the patrolling guards until he finally came to the room where the prisons were located. The prison guard was asleep, to both Altaïr's rage and relief, allowing him easy entrance to the prison cell. He found Malik in the cell's corner, skinny to the bone and with his hair long and his beard overgrown.</p><p>Altaïr physically knocked the guard unconscious before lifting Malik's arm over his shoulder and taking him back to his residence. There, Malik revealed that Abbas had staged a coup two years before, and had Sef killed, before putting the blame on Malik. Malik regretted that he had not been a better leader, and that this would not have happened to Altaïr. Altaïr and Maria waited until he was asleep before going to confront Abbas about the truth.</p><p>Together, they faced Abbas, who greeted them. He was joined by Swami not too soon afterwards, who delivered him a burlap sack. Abbas took a look in it, before giving the sack to Altaïr. Upon opening it, he found out that it contained the head of Malik, who had been quickly killed by Swami after being left alone. Abbas publicly asked Altaïr why he had infiltrated the prison, which caused the other present Assassins to doubt Altaïr's motives.</p><p>Abbas said that Altaïr was not in a state to control the Order, and demanded of Altaïr that he give the Apple of Eden to him. For some reason, Altaïr agreed to this and took the Apple out of his robes. Swami was sent to take the Apple, and when he approached Altaïr, he whispered to the former leader that, before Sef's death, he been told that his own father had ordered his death. Altaïr became furious, and his rage was sent into the Apple. When Swami touched it, his eyes started popping out and his mouth became wide open, with a golden glow erupting from it.</p><p>Maria yelled at Altaïr that he had let his rage take over and used the Apple to control the Assassin. Swami started to bring his dagger to his throat, but as Altaïr stopped, he accidentally stabbed Maria in the spine, who was standing right next to him. Altaïr hurried to Maria, who died in his arms, and then stabbed Swami in the neck with his Hidden Blade out of anger. Altaïr returned to confront Abbas, and the other Assassins present were afraid that Altaïr might use the Apple again.</p><p>In a moment of insecurity, Altaïr decided to flee the castle and village, which he managed to do successfully after rejoining his son Darim in the village. He traveled to Alamut, where he spent the next twenty years with his son, former daughter-in-law, and grandchildren. Altaïr began to show remorse from his actions, and completely focused his studies on the Apple of Eden, creating new designs, tactics and medicine. After some time, Sef's wife and children left Alamut, and they apparently settled in Alexandria, Egypt.</p><p>Driven away by his father's remorse and obsession with the Apple, Darim had also left Alamut for France and England to warn them of the emerging Mongol threat. On one occasion, the Apple directed Altaïr to six artifacts that he retrieved and hid. He was told that they were a message for someone; however, Altaïr did not know for whom.</p><h4><span>Reclaiming his title</span></h4><p>Eventually, he was wounded in both legs and dropped to his knees, after which Bayhas tried to finish him off. Before he could do so, however, Mukhlis - who was hung upside down by the bandits in a tree - swung and held onto Bayhas. Altaïr quickly thrust his sword upwards into Bayhas' stomach and Mukhlis took Bayhas' dagger in mid-air as it dropped. He cut his rope and stood next to his savior, facing Long Hair.</p><p>Long Hair found himself outnumbered and fled on horseback. Mukhlis brought Altaïr home with him, and his wife Aalia and daughter Nalia tended to his wounds. For two days, he grew dangerously pale, but on the third day he regained his color. Mukhlis, who had been speaking to him for the past three days, hoping that the old man would regain consciousness, mentioned that Master Altaïr would not have allowed Abbas, who was an inadequate leader, to take care of the Order.</p><p>The moment that Mukhlis mentioned his name, Altaïr woke up and revealed his identity. Mukhlis brought the bad state of the Order to Altaïr's attention, who went on to show the people the right ways of the Order, through example. He settled disputes in the town, and had the tradesmen in the city make new tools and medicine for him. As he traveled across the village, he noticed a shadow - an Assassin - following him. When he got to the fountain, he noticed that the man was standing behind him and addressed him.</p><p>The Assassin said that he was one of few that remained loyal to the old codes, and revealed himself to be Tazim Al-Sayf, who was also called Malik; the son of Altaïr's late friend. Altaïr revealed to him that he planned to take control of the Order to restore it back to its former glory and before Fahad, the father of Bayhas, came to Masyaf, and thus asked Tazim to rally all the Assassins that were loyal to Altaïr. Altaïr waited outside the castle gates and was met by the young Malik and a group of about twenty Assassins.</p><p>He explained that there was to be no killing; the Assassins should respect the Creed, and that no Assassin, loyal to Abbas or Altaïr, should kill a Brother. One of Abbas' followers heard this and charged at Altaïr, hoping to kill him and stop the uprising. Despite his old age, Altaïr, with great speed, dodged the incoming attack and killed the Assassin with his sword. The Assassins loyal to Abbas, who fought without enthusiasm, were all easily captured or knocked unconscious.</p><p>However, a second wave of them arrived, including Assassin archers, who readied their bows at the ramparts. Altaïr hoped that the archers would be of good heart and lower their bows once they saw that Altaïr's men did not intend to kill. As Abbas and Altaïr caught sight of one another, the archers lowered their bows, and the Abbas Assassins surrendered as well, quickly noticing the turn of events. The castle gates were opened by surrendering Assassins, and Altaïr and Abbas came face to face.</p><p>Abbas still hated Altaïr, and would not believe the truth about his father. Abbas, slowly beginning to be aware of the tide of battle turning against him, sent his remaining men to attack Altaïr; daring his rival to take back the Order without any loss of Assassin life.</p><p>Altaïr raised his arm and pointed it towards Abbas. Then an explosion was heard, and smoke erupted from Altaïr's hand, he finally used his hidden gun for the first time. Abbas fell to the ground, and Altaïr crouched over him. Abbas said that he still would not believe what Altaïr had said about his father, and that he would find the truth soon, in the afterlife. At this, Altaïr was the Master once again.</p><p>Two days later, Fahad arrived with his force. However, Altaïr managed to persuade him to back down, saying that they would only cause the downfall of their own communities should their forces fight one another.</p><h3><span>Later life</span></h3><p>Altaïr began building a library in Masyaf on the location where Al Mualim's garden once was, where he would store thousands of his books containing knowledge gained from the Apple. The five seals he had obtained while residing in Alamut were used as keys for this library. After it was completed by 1257, Altaïr sent Darim to invite the Venetian explorers Niccolò and Maffeo Polo to Masyaf. After they had arrived, Altaïr told Niccolò stories about his life, which Niccolò would later pass on to his son, Marco, in the form of a journal</p><p>Additionally, Altaïr began to dissolve the Order from Masyaf, saying it should be spread throughout the world. He thus intended to have Assassin Guilds created in new countries, a task which he thought the Polo brothers could be useful in. In late 1257, Masyaf came under siege by Mongols, and Niccolò and Maffeo were forced to leave. Before they did, Altaïr gave his Codex to the explorers, relying on them to start Assassin Guilds in other countries. He also gave them his seals, which they later hid throughout Constantinople. Altaïr then personally escorted the two out of Masyaf, fighting off the Mongols with his Apple of Eden. Standing in front of Masyaf's gates, Altaïr lastly handed Niccolò five of the six Memory Seals he had previously found,asking him to hide them and prevent them from falling in the wrong hands. Unfortunately, the brothers lost the Codex to the Mongols on their way back home.Altaïr returned to Masyaf castle and, once he was sure everyone else had been evacuated, locked himself into his library, which was previously emptied of books by Darim on Altaïr's orders. Saying farewell to his son before the library door, Altaïr entered it armed with the Apple, making his way towards the far end of the library. There, he placed the Apple on a pedestal and sealed it behind the wall. Desiring to sit and rest for a while, he sat on the center chair in the library. Altaïr then imprinted a memory into his sixth and last key while seated, right before passing awa</p><h2><span>Legacy</span></h2><p>In 1269, Altaïr's Codex had passed into the hands of Marco Polo, who had retrieved it from Kublai Khan. The Templars, having knowledge about the Codex, hired a contingent of pirates to retrieve it from the Assassin Dante Alighieri, who was transporting it from Venice to Spain.</p><p>Dante was also escorted by his apprentice, a man named Domenico, who had only recently been made aware of his Assassin heritage. As the pirates attacked, Domenico broke apart the Codex and hid it from the pirates, though he was too late to save the life of his Master and his wife.</p><p>Eventually, Domenico and his son took the name of Auditore, and constructed the Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni.Beneath the villa, they constructed the Sanctuary; inside of which rested the unbreakable armor of Altaïr. These robes later passed into the possession of one of Domenico's descendants: the Assassin <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75368\" href=\"/ezio-auditore-da-firenze/4005-75368/\">Ezio Auditore da Firenze</a></p><p>Ezio Auditore - the fabled 'prophet' - would use Altaïr's codex (which was taken back from powerful Italian Templars) to construct the weapons with the help of Leonardo da Vinci and locate the hidden vault, later revealed to be underneath the Vatican. After the eventual defeat of the Templars in Rome, Ezio traveled to Masyaf to learn more about the order, but found it overrun by Templars. Traveling to Constantinople, Ezio searched for the seals left behind by Altaïr to see into moments of Altaïr's life, gained access to the library underneath Masyaf and ultimately reveal the future.</p><p>Centuries later, in the early 21 Century the Templar organization Abstergo Industries kidnapped a descendant of Altaïr, Desmond Miles as \"Subject 17 ,\" in order to \"read\" the memories that were encoded into his DNA. Using the Animus, Desmond was forced to relive the memories of his ancestors, his time in the Animus was overseen by researchers Dr. Warren Vidic and his assistant, an undercover Assassin named Lucy Stillman. Throughout his sessions, they strove to find a specific memory about the Pieces of Eden, to use for the Templar's project bent on creating a \"New World Order</p><p>Following his escape from Abstergo Industries, Desmond, suffering from a condition known as the \"bleeding effect\", received a hallucination of Altaïr's memories whilst outside the Animus. Within the hallucination Desmond watched as Altaïr chased a hooded figure through the castle of Acre.</p><p>Ending upon the castle's highest tower, the runner herself to be Maria. After sharing an intimate moment with her, Altaïr left; leaving Desmond shocked upon realizing that he was no longer following Altaïr – he had just witnessed the conception of his ancestor Sef Ibn-La'Ahad.</p><p>After entering a comatose state, Desmond was linked up to the Animus 2.0 and in the hope of repairing his splintered subconscious and revealing the future, he searched his genetic memories for a specific memory connecting himself, Altaïr and his Renaissance ancestor, Ezio Auditore together. Altaïr's Apple and Ezio's knowledge of the future enabled Desmond to enter a Sync Nexus and receive the location of the Grand Temple</p><h2>Skills &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Altair, as a Master Assassin was extremely skilled in acrobatics, stealth, and swordsmanship. By using his training as an Assassin he was able to overcome anything in his path whether it be human or an object. He was also skilled at performing a Leap of faith off a tower or high building, he was one of the few Assassins of his time who could. Like his Assassin Brethren Altair was extremely skilled in various assassination techniques using stealth. He was also trained in Hand-to-hand combat, knife throwing, swordsmanship, weapons combat, climbing, parkour,eavesdropping, and pick pocketing.</p><h3>Romances</h3><p>The earliest information about Altaïr's love interests lay with Adha, who was also known as the Chalice. At first appearance, there only seemed to be a friendly relationship between them, but on a closer inspection of the Codex, more of Altaïr's feelings for her were revealed. Her death consumed the young Assassin with hatred, and he swore vengeance on all those who had killed her. He hunted down and killed every man responsible for her death; but this brought no joy or satisfaction, and he was left heavily scarred by her memory. He wrote in the Codex that he felt he would never have the same feelings for any other woman, and that the love he later felt for Maria Thorpe proved him wrong.</p><p>Altaïr first met Maria when she was serving her master Robert de Sable as a decoy at the funeral of Majd Addin. However, there was no improvement in their relationship until she became Altaïr's prisoner, just before he traveled to Cyprus to help the resistance against the Templars.</p><p>During these events, Maria acted very rebelliously against her captor. However, in time, they both grew to know each other; and once Maria learned and accepted the truth of what the Templars truly were, there was hope for both of them. From the Codex, it was revealed that they did foster a relationship together, and eventually got married. Altaïr and Maria had at least two sons, who they named Darim and Sef Ibn-La'Ahad.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Altaïr was a Master Assassin and instructor, capable of extraordinary acrobatic feats, adept in social stealth, and fully apt in the application of deadly arts and possessed great physical and mental strength and stamina. Trained extensively, he was able to overcome any obstacle, human or terrain. He was able to get anywhere, climbing the tallest tower and jumping from the highest ledge without a hint of fear.</p><p>Like other Assassins, he was also trained in stealth assassination techniques, hand to hand and weapons combat, blade throwing, climbing, urban acrobatics, eavesdropping, interrogation, pick pocketing and anything else that would help complete a mission. Besides physical prowess, he also had extensive knowledge of the Holy Land politics and religion, which helped the Assassins understand their opponents.</p><p>As a high member of the Order, Altaïr possessed an array of weapons at his disposal, comprised of a longsword, A short blade, throwing knives, and the iconic Hidden Blade. Altaïr also possessed an ability called Eagle Vision, a sort of \"sixth sense\" or intuition that allowed him to see people's true intentions, though this seemed to be a rarity even among the Assassins.</p><p>During his 80s, Altaïr was less skilled than in his youth, due to his age and for being inactive from the Order for so long and lack of training. However, according to Niccolò Polo, Altaïr still retained the same strength, stamina and skill he had in his youth at the age of 92, possibly due to the Assassin retraining and regaining his old skills once reclaiming title of leader.</p><p>Due to his gift of Eagle Vision, Altaïr had heightened intuitive abilities and senses, along with his sharpened fighting skills. Altaïr's abilities made him one of the most deadly and adept members in the Assassin Order's history. Altaïr's fighting skills became legendary through the Assassin Order, even after his death.</p><p>As a Master Assassin, Altaïr has a pair of long white robes with a red sash, leather armor, and sheaths to store his weaponry and pouches. At 92, Altaïr wore long white robes with patterns imprinted on them and a black cape. Despite his age, Altaïr still continued to wield two Hidden Blades, though he carried no other weapon</p><p><b>Personality</b></p><p>Altaïr was raised at the Assassin's fortress at Masyaf and possessed incredible skills, quickly rising among the ranks of the Order. A cold and objective person, he fully devoted himself to the cause he chose to pursue. Altaïr had a rebellious nature; he was impetuous, demanding, arrogant, self-centered, and impatient. However, after the failure at Solomon's Temple and being sent after the nine, Altaïr began listening to the final words of his victims, and their justifications for their deeds.</p><p>As his mission progressed, his attitude changed, and he began to perceive the lines and actions of the world, as well as draw upon the teachings of the Creed: prior a guide, now a way of life. At the end of the conflict, all of his brash and rebellious nature had been put under control, and he became a calm, focused, driven and wise man. Even in his early life as an Assassin, Altaïr was one of the most respected and feared in the Order, second only to the Brotherhood's leader, Al Mualim.</p><p>Smart and dedicated, his studies and determination to ensure \"peace in all things\" ensured that the Order survived to fight for as long as was necessary. He understood that the new world would have no place for the current ways of the Assassins and thus changed its practices accordingly. Also, his cold personality did not impede his emotions: Altaïr was known to have fallen in love at least twice, with Adha, who unfortunately died and was avenged subsequently,and Maria Thorpe, de Sable's steward, who became his wife and the mother of his children.</p><p>Altaïr, although remaining often calm and controlled, sometimes allowed his anger to get the better of him, such as almost using the Apple to force Swami to kill himself. By his 80s, Altaïr became a very isolated individual, as Maria's death drove him into deep depression. During this time he began to hate the Apple and spend nights staring at it. By the time he reclaimed his title as leader of the Levantine Assassins and rebuilt the Order, Altaïr was able to put his grief behind him.</p><p>Altaïr was also a natural leader. Even at 24, during the Assault on Masyaf, he was able to quickly take control of the situation and devise a plan, which resulted in saving Al Mualim and the Assassins winning the battle. As Mentor, he was believed to have done more for the Order than any Mentor before him, including his predecessor</p>",

    "deck": "Ezio Auditore da Firenze is yet another ancestor of Desmond Miles, and the main protagonist of Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood, and Revelations. He is an Italian Assassin who rose to the rank of a master, before his death at the age of 65.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Ezio was born on June 24, 1459 to Giovanni and Maria Auditore, while he appeared stilborn at first he began to cry after some encouragement from his father and was dubbed a fighter. Ezio's family was a rich one so he lead a life of luxury. His father was a prominent banker in <a href=\"../../florence-italy/34-56672/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Florence</a> and Ezio himself was an apprentice to the Banker Giovanni Tornabuoni in order to learn the trade and possibly one day take over the Auditore Bank. Ezio was not the only child to his parents, his older brother Frederico Auditore da Firenze was 3 years older and was admitted to the Assassins Guild before Ezio even knew of the Guilds exsistance. Their younger sister Claudia and brother Petruccio round out the 4 Auditore children. At a young age, he saw his two brothers, alongside his father, getting murdered. They were hung by Uberto Alberti, who betrayed Giovanni. He received his training from his Uncle Mario, and it was Mario that convinced Ezio to become an assassin.</p><h2>Character Creation</h2><p>Ezio is one of the main protagonist in the Assassin's Creed video game franchise. He was developed Ubisoft Montreal's creative team. Ubisoft's Entertainment controls the distribution of the character, and other media he appears in such as comics, novels, and films</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>After the betrayal and death of his father and brothers, Ezio takes up his father’s mantle as an assassin and carries out his revenge on those who all but destroyed his family. Ezio managed to gather his skills by getting trained by his uncle, Mario, who not only teached him his skills, but the history of the Assassins' order, his father's history and the most important one, the Templars. Ezio shared a relationship with the beautiful lady known as Christina at the age of 17. After receiving his training by Mario, he later came back to Firenze for a mission, but at the same time discovered that Christina was married away. When he was in Venezia, he shared another relationship with a thief named Rose. Ezio became the leader of a new order of Assassins and built up their order in Rome, and their sole objective was to protect the free will of mankind from the Templars whose desire was to instill and order into mankind and bring about peace through the destruction of free will. When in Rome, he saw other people who were not afraid of the Borgia, and they fought back. At the same time, Ezio and Machiavelli needed more men, Ezio saw these people as being useful. Alongside this, the Borgia had taken over parts of Rome by fear and intimidation. The Borgia's symbols were presenting the Borgia, and by destroying these symbols, Ezio could free those parts of the city who were influenced by the Borgia. After destroying these symbols, Ezio could recruit the people who fought back, and through this, he made them assassins, and not only did these assassins help create Rome a better place, but they helped to free other cities under the influence of the Templars. Later when in constantinopolis, he did the same thing to the people who weren't afraid of the Templars. During his time in constantinopolis, there was another Italian women who he fell in love with and got a child with, her name being Sofia Sartor.</p><p>After completing his final quest of searching for his ancestor’s, Altair Ibn-La'Ahad, lost library Ezio retired from the life of an Assassin. He settled down in Tuscany, and at the age of 65 he died leaving behind his wife and daughter. Centuries after his death his descendant, Desmond Miles, would relive Ezio’s memories through a simulation machine known as the Animus in a quest to stop the Templars from once again from finding artifacts left behind by a mysterious race known as the first civilization and stop them from bringing about the end of the world.</p><p>During his time as an Assassin Ezio assassinated notable historic figures such as Cesare Borgia, and was allied by other historic figures such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Niccolo Machiavelli, and a young Suleiman I.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Assassin's Creed: The Fall</h3><p>A statue of him could be found in \"The Mentor's\" Dubai facility in the 21st century, alongside with other prominent Assassins.</p><p>In the behind the scenes video and on Ubiworkshops website, an Ubisoft affiliate, a four page preview shows Ezio preforming an assassination, before escaping. In the video they discuss that originally that Assassin's Creed: The Fall was meant to detail an untold part of Ezio's life. Eventually they scrapped the idea and went with the idea to tell a story about a new character and new location.</p><h3>Assassin's Creed: Desmond</h3><p>After Desmond relives the memories of Altair, and escapes Abstergo, he goes with the Assassin's into a warehouse where they have and animus identical to Abstergo's. While there and in the company of the other Assassin's such as Lucy Stiliman, Desmond begins reliving the memories of his ancestor Ezio. Ezio's character design makes a cameo appearance.</p><h2><b>Powers &amp; Abilities</b></h2><p>Ezio was both a highly skilled Assassin and an adept Mentor. He learned and developed a vast array of skills, such as pick-pocketing, blending, armed and unarmed combat, alternative or multiple weapon attacks, stealth and public assassination techniques, free-running and long-range combat.</p><p>He was also able to use a variety of weapons, including two hidden blades, a poison blade, a sword, throwing knives, a hidden gun, poison darts, and many more. He managed to get most of his weapons by Leonardo Da Vinci helping Ezio to fix them such as his father's hidden blades, his poison blade and the hidden gun. </p><p>Although Ezio doesn't have any powers, he is considered to be a demon by many people. His speed and strenght has been given to him by years of training, and pushing his body past the limit. Ezio's speed and strength have been described being \"given to him by the Devil'', as he has performed superhuman feats, putting his stats up to superhuman.</p><p>Born with the ability to use Eagle Vision, Ezio could instinctively differentiate friend from foe. After talking to his captive father, he later inherited his father's Assassin robes, which he would upgrade with various armor and dyes throughout his life.</p><p>An explorer, throughout his quests, Ezio scoured the cities he visited in search of Codex pages and seals from the six Assassin's tombs spread across northern Italy. The Codex pages allowed Leonardo da Vinci to upgrade his weaponry, including the addition of a wheellock firearm and poison needle concealed beneath his left hidden blade.</p><p>By collecting the six tomb seals, Ezio gained access to the armor Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad created, which was later lost during the Fall of Monteriggioni. Ezio wears an arm bracer, capable of taking multiple hits from blades and such. He also collected capes that had helped him stay incognito to city guards. The only exception to this was the cape bearing the Auditore family crest, which made him easily recognizable, due to his family's history.</p><p>In 1500, during the Siege of Monteriggioni, Ezio lost most of his equipment, but was able to keep his original hidden blade. His hidden blade also underwent some alterations anonymously by Niccolò Machiavelli, though he merely replaced the former leather and metal bracer with a new, fully plated version bearing a different design. Also, the former blade was replaced with a newer one that bore a black tribal design running down the center of the blade.</p><p>During his time in Rome, Ezio's usual attire would be replaced by a new outfit based on elements from both his father's clothing and Altaïr's robes. He became an adept user of the crossbow, and also obtained the Armor of Brutus after stealing all the scrolls from the Followers of Romulus. In addition, Ezio also acquired poison darts and parachutes, courtesy of Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p>Ezio had been a very skilled free-runner from a young age. He learned how to free-run under the tutelage of either his father or older brother, and was able to move quickly and efficiently in sprinting, climbing, and jumping. In addition, he was also an enduring athlete, being able to perform all these actions without being encumbered by his large variety of weapons and armor.</p><p>Despite his advancing years, Ezio Auditore skill and speed as a free-runner increased significantly, being aware of all of his surroundings as well as planning his next move very quickly and carefully, as observed by younger Assassins such as Francesco Vecellio.</p><p>Ezio's speed and abilities gave him a legendary status among the Roman Thieves Guild, so far as going to convince some of the members to believe that Ezio's free-running skills were exaggerated, and blatantly impossible for someone his age.</p><p>By 1511, Ezio still retained his athletic abilities and skill in combat. His Eagle Vision had evolved into Eagle Sense, enabling him to track enemies, determine targets, and find lost books around Constantinople. He acquired the hookblade from his fellow Master Assassin and close friend, Yusuf Tazim, and quickly mastered its utility in free-running and combat.</p><p>He also made use of bomb-crafting after it had been introduced to him by Yusuf and Piri Reis. After discovering the ten memoir pages of Ishak Pasha scattered across Constantinople, Ezio explored the Hagia Sophia and recovered his armor.</p><p>After he retired, Ezio's physique degraded significantly. By 1524, Ezio's stamina and agility had decreased to the point where he could barely run across his own grape field, whereas before he could sprint for three-hundred meters uninterrupted. If not for neglecting his training, then Ezio's drastic physical deterioration was due to old age and illness, though he retained his heightened sense of awareness.</p><p>Even with his severe handicaps, Ezio was still able to overpower three Chinese swordsmen, who were presumably in peak condition, with only his fireplace poker. He was even able to use the poker as an improvised hookblade, using it to throw an attacker across the room before hurling it into his skull. However, Ezio was completely outmatched by the last enemy in terms of strength, and would have definitely been killed had the attacker not succumbed to the injuries inflicted by both Ezio and Shao Jun.</p><p>Ezio took quite a beating for a man his age during the assault on his Villa, and this may have contributed to his passing not long after Jun's departure, though it is more likely that his heart simply could not handle the amount of stress he had gone through.</p><h2><b>Personality and Characteristics</b></h2><blockquote><p><b><i>\"Requiescat in Pace\"</i></b></p><p><i>-Ezio Auditore-</i></p></blockquote><p>Ezio came from an affluent background and had many friends until the deaths of his father and brothers drove him out of Florence. Forced to protect his mother and sister, Ezio became an Assassin, exacting revenge on the conspirators who had betrayed his family and plotted to seize both Florence and Venice.</p><p>Initially, Ezio allowed his emotions to get the best of him, going so far as to disrespect the corpse of Vieri de' Pazzi just after his death. However, Ezio did manage to gain control of his anger and, by the time he had become a Master Assassin, could control it almost completely.That said, Ezio was still prone to losing control of his emotions at the right trigger; in 1506, he beat up Duccio de Luca in a fist-fight, after the latter had insulted Ezio's sister, Claudia, for her position as the Madame of the Rosa in Fiore.</p><p>However, by the time Ezio confronted Rodrigo Borgia, he had become more dedicated to his role as an Assassin, ceasing to use revenge as a motivation. He became more focused on instilling a sense of fraternity among his apprentices, and a love of the cultures they would defend from the Templars He also spared the lives of any targets that he concluded had no need to die, such as Micheletto Corella.</p><p>Ezio was also passionately loyal to his family, and was pained for the rest of his life after the Auditore execution. While he was able to lay the bodies of his fallen family to rest, he continued collecting feathers during his time in Italy, as a remembrance of his youngest brother. The feather collection was part of what helped his mother recover from her depression at the loss of her sons and husband.</p><p>Ezio always put protecting his mother and sister above his safety and his allegiance to the Assassins, quick to defend his sister's honor from Duccio, and always ready to help his mother, even when she was helping her daughter lead the courtesans in Rome. Claudia thought Ezio a bit overbearing at times, as shown by her journal, but knew that he was trying to help regardless, and stood by her brother with the Assassins.</p><p>Ezio became more quiet and distant during his late 40s, reluctant to share information regarding his early life with associates such as Salaì, but also being more open with those he knew better and cared for.</p><p>Near the end of his life, although he was still as loving and passionate when talking to his family, Ezio was far more gruff towards strangers such as Shao Jun. Although Ezio eventually warmed up to Shao Jun, he explained that he wanted nothing more to do with the Assassins out of fear that the Templars would endanger his wife and children (this fear probably stemmed, in part, from the deaths of his father and brothers).</p><p>It can even be said that Ezio had grown paranoid of strangers since, in comparison to previous seasons, he had not hired any help for the grape harvest despite his worsening condition. In addition, Ezio was shown to have grown somewhat forgetful, possibly increasing his uneasiness with strangers.</p><p>Ezio also seemed to be aware, or at least have a feeling, that his time was growing short, evidenced by his confession to Sofia, \"I knew I would not have time to do everything, now I worry that I don't have time to do anything,\" as well as his preparation of a final letter in the event of his death.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h4>Movies</h4><p>Assassin's Creed: Lineage - A series of 3 short films taht set the stage foe Assassin's Creed II, Primarly focusing on Giovanni Auditore.</p><p>Assassin's Creed: Ascendance - A short animated film set in-between Assassins Creed II and Brotherhood, delving into Cesare Borgia's backround</p><p>Assassin's Creed: Embers - An animated short film that details the final days of Ezio Auditore's life, his meeting with Shao Jun, and his death in Florence at the age of 65.</p><h4>Novels</h4><p>Assassin's Creed: Renaissance - The novelization version of the game Assassin's Creed II.</p><p>Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade - A novel focusing on the story of <a href=\"/altair-ibn-laahad/4005-75367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75367\">Altair</a> narrated by Niccolo Polo, the father of famed explorer Marco Polo.

This spy version of Cornelius was bi-sexual in nature and was considered a hipster.</p><p>What makes Jerry Cornelius interesting is that he is one of the first characters to explore metaphysics in literature. Creator <a href=\"/michael-moorcock/4040-50933/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-50933\">Michael Moorcock</a> and other writers later would explore alternate versions of Jerry Cornelius in the multiple universes (or Multiverse).</p><h3><a href=\"/king-mob/4005-23146/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23146\"><b>King Mob</b></a> and <a href=\"/the-invisibles/4060-47648/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47648\"><b>The Invisibles</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62444/1615345-kingmob_draw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1615345\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.6393442622951\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:163.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62444/1615345-kingmob_draw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1615345\"><img alt=\"King Mob\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62444/1615345-kingmob_draw.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62444/1615345-kingmob_draw.jpg 244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px\" data-width=\"244\"></a><figcaption>King Mob</figcaption></figure><p>Writer <a href=\"/grant-morrison/4040-40434/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40434\">Grant Morrison</a> is famous for being one of main writers to bring literature to comic books. Morrison has always explored metaphysics in comics from series like Animal Man to the hypersigil opus that is The Invisibles.</p><p>Jerry Cornelius would make a great inspiration for a character like King Mob (the leader of The Invisibles). Like Jerry, King Mob is a spy who loves sex. It is very possible Morrison created King Mob as a <a href=\"/michael-moorcocks-multiverse/4050-27788/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27788\">multiverse</a> version of Jerry Cornelius. <a href=\"/ragged-robin/4005-23187/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23187\">Ragged Robin</a> of The Invisibles is suppose to be a <a href=\"/hypertime/4015-55762/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55762\">Hypertime</a> version of <a href=\"/crazy-jane/4005-27304/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27304\">Crazy Jane</a> of Doom Patrol, it is very likely Morrison believe all characters are just alternate versions of something else, in one giant blend of Hypetime and Multiverse salad.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The airtight garage of Jerry Cornelius</h3><p>In this French Scifi-classic, Cornelius is a cosmic being, who originated from Terra. He is an agent of Nagual (a God, possibly Jahveh) and <a href=\"/major-grubert/4005-28651/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28651\">Major Gruberts</a> antagonist (reason why is never explained). He searches for Grubert, so he can fight against him. When he finally finds him, the Garage is in the claws of a crisis, and the two enemies must team up to save it. They do so, and as the result, Cornelius dies.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Axe Cop is a web-comic turned published series written by a <a href=\"/malachai-nicolle/4040-61125/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-61125\">5 year old</a> (5 when the comic began, now 8 years of age) and illustrated by his <a href=\"/ethan-nicolle/4040-59009/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-59009\">thirty year old brother.</a> Yes, it really is that awesome.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Axe Cop became a cop when he walked into a police station and signed a free sign-up form. It is assumed that sometime after this is when he found the perfect fire ax and became Axe Cop. He immediately set out to find a partner and held tryouts. He was joined by <a href=\"/dinosaur-soldier/4005-75392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75392\">Flute Cop</a>, who was also coincidentally his long lost brother, whom he didn't recognized because they bumped into each other's heads and lost all their memory. They immediately set out to kill a gang of dinosaurs, and in the process Flute Cop got dinosaur blood on him, causing him to turn into <a href=\"/dinosaur-soldier/4005-75392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75392\">Dinosaur Soldier</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96314/2110955-axecopdinosoldeir_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2110955\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2935779816514\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96314/2110955-axecopdinosoldeir_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2110955\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96314/2110955-axecopdinosoldeir_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/96314/2110955-axecopdinosoldeir_.jpg 327w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" data-width=\"494\"></a></figure><p>Sometime after this the new duo held more tryouts, and were approached by Telescope Gun Cop. However this tryout was interrupted by Psydrozon, a giant one eyed robot with two swords, being controlled by Pretzel Head, who could control robots with his mind and turn his head into a pretzel. Axe Cop killed Psydrozon using Uni-Baby, a baby with a unicorn horn on his head and took Psydrozon's body for his own. He told Telescope Gun Cop that he didn't need him now that he had a robot suit. This caused him to go back in time and kill Axe Cop and Flute Cop's Parents, Bobber and Gobber Smartist, which made the brothers vow to become cops and fight crime.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Axe Cop, unlike Flute Cop and most supporting characters, stays pretty much the same for the whole time. (whereas Flute Cop turns into Dino Soldier, then into Avocado Soldier, etc.) His character is slowly revealed in a series called Ask Axe Cop, in which he responds to fan mail, asking him questions about his day to day life.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><h3>Evil EVIL Planet Tinko</h3><p>In the beginning of this chapter, Uni-Man reveals that his baby is missing, which is why he is so sad. Axe Cop knows where Uni-Baby is, and they go to the Snow Planet to find her. They do so by looking through 2 billion plus kids until they find a baby with a hole in it. They then make plans to go to Planet Tinko to kill the aliens who kidnapped Uni-Baby in the first place. Afterwards, Avocado Soldier gives Uni-Man his horn back, but wishes to be Dinosaur Soldier (and for every weapon) before he does so. Sockarang also acquires a chainsaw and a unicorn horn right before they leave. At Evil EVIL Planet Tinko, the gang (after picking up the Psydrozon suit) confront the evil alien army, which turns into a bunch of small robots that bite people. Uni-Man summons a superhero to help them fight, but he only gets Mr. Stocker, who has no powers and is immediately turned into a small robot when he got bit, along with Leaf Man and the Wrestler. They try to bite Axe Cop but he bites them instead (turning them into good guys), and pretty soon everyone is biting each other and the robot army kills themselves. King Evilfatsozon is not happy about this. They try to kill him with Psydrozon, but they cannot because it was him who threw the robot at Earth in the first place. However, Axe Cop guesses his weakness and impales him with Uni-Man, coincidentally right before the alien king was about to tell him what his weakness was anyways. Then they blew up Evil, EVIL Planet Tinko with a single stick of TNT. It was a happy ending.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>TV Series</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114158/3163293-5970455328-Axe-C.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3163293\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.54015748031496\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114158/3163293-5970455328-Axe-C.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3163293\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114158/3163293-5970455328-Axe-C.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114158/3163293-5970455328-Axe-C.jpg 635w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111114158/3163293-5970455328-Axe-C.jpg 480w, http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114158/3163293-5970455328-Axe-C.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Recently Axe Cop has his own TV show on Fox.

However, when Batman joins the fight with the Birds of Prey at the night club, Current tells Calculator by via comm link that he wants out. Calculator, of course, will not allow failure so he threatens Current that if he doesn't complete his mission then he may just have to ask Mammoth to pay a visit to Current's girlfriend.</p> <p>When the Birds of Prey are taken hostage on a school bus, Current is instructed by Calculator to check for any tracking devices on the women since Batgirl was able to find Calculator's hideout in Slaughter Swamp thanks to Oracle. Lady Blackhawk takes advantage of this search by lashing out Current when he begins to grope her knees. Unfortunately, Zinda is struck back by his fully-charged suit. Current laughs off Zinda's threat that there are consequences for striking a lady as blood drips down her mouth.  </p> <p>        <br/> </p>",

And while she cannot control the animals of the jungle they do trust her so that she is able to calm ferocious ones.</p><h2>Creators</h2><p>The series first appeared in Australia in black &amp; white (blue &amp; white in her second outing for some reason) where it was called Kazanda the Wild Gil and the Forbidden Kingdom which appeared in both Australian comics and a number of collections featuring only her, and was later published in America in Rangers Comics as Kazanda, where it was given full color for the first time.</p><p>It was drawn by Ted Brodie-Mack from Wellington, New Zealand, and written by Peter Amos a pseudonym of Archie E. Martin.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2> <p>While hunting in Burma, wealthy self indulgent  playboy Bob Benton is mangled by a tiger, while he manages to kill it still manages to wound him enough to doom Bob. He would have died if not for a Burmese medicine man who using magic and the tigers own blood brings Bob back to life.</p> <p>Soon Bob finds that life is not the only thing that the tiger’s blood has given him, it has also imparted part of it’s fierce power to him. Returning home to America, accompanied by Burmese houseboy Pali and his pet monkey, Bob abandons his self indulgent lifestyle and dedicates himself to helping others in the city of Metropolis (yes Metropolis).</p> <p>To do this he has a special high-powered car, boat and plane built and then starts handing out flyers announcing \"Are you in danger? call Tiger Man!\" with his phone number at the bottom. ( and a special amazing machine of his design that answers the phone and records the messages when he’s not around!)</p> <p>Shown a few times in the comics, when Bob would become Tiger Man, a silhouette or shadow of a tiger appears in the background of the panel.  Now empowered by the might of a tiger when he needs it, becomes the scourge of the underworld.  </p>",

She accompanied her husband throughout the universe as he conquered various galaxies, and was with him as he set his sights on the Earth. After Mondo's defeat and destruction at the hand's of the Ranger's , she constantly faced and rebuffed the advances of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-66186\" href=\"/lord-zedd/4005-66186/\">  Lord Zedd</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-39640\" href=\"/rita-repulsa/4005-39640/\">   Rita Repulsa's</a> renegade robot Louie Kaboom, who unsurped control of the Machine Empire. <br /> <br />Knowing her husband was being rebuilt, she was supportive when her son Gasket, and his wife Archeria took control of the empire.  When he finally was finished rebuilt she quickly moved back to his side, as Mondo drove away the prince and princess. But Machina's ultimate fate was her own destruction at the end of Zeo, at the hand's of a bomb from Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, that eliminated the entire Royal House of Gadgetry.  <br /> <br />But the entire royal family was ultimately rebuilt and became members of the United Alliance of Evil, and participated in the conquering of the universe. But ultimately her, along with most of the empire was ultimately destroyed during this, as  consequence of Zordon's energy wave, reducing her along with her family to nothing but sand.</p>",

    "deck": "Mountbatten of Fables is a wind-up toy that was alive. He died at the hands of Therese and the toys of Toyland.",
    "description": "<p>Lord Mountbatten, a clockwork tiger capable of taking physical form. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49487\" href=\"/mowgli/4005-49487/\">Mowgli</a> met him in The India, the Homelands version of India, and brought him to the Farm. He's worked alongside <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7266\" href=\"/bigby-wolf/4005-7266/\">Bigby</a>, his brothers, and Mowgli during a battle against the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55591\" href=\"/the-emperor/4005-55591/\">Emperor</a>. Mountbatten, along with another toy Ranger Mike Danger, and Darien venture to Toyland to go and find Therese, hoping to bring her home. But they are ambushed and attacked by the toys, during which Ranger Mike Danger's destroyed. And unfortunately, he's separated from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-18501\" href=\"/darien/4005-18501/\">Darien</a>, whom becomes gravely injured. He's then captured by the toys and brought to the court in front of Therese.</p><p>Although he tries to state he came to save Therese, and pleads for her to spare him. His pleas fall on death ears, whether because of her hunger or the influence of the land, Therese orders his execution. He's killed quickly and violently by the toys and Therese feeds on his raw flesh savagely. She quickly ordered to have the rest cooked, even if it meant using the wooden toys. Afterwards, though, Therese shows extreme regret and guilt for her deeds. When its revealed her brother was on Toyland and sacrificed himself to bring a magical cauldron to life to save her, she falls into grief. As she mourns her brother's life, Therese matures and sees the error of her ways to Mountbatten.</p><p>As the years went by in Toyland, an older and mature Therese sends the toys out to save the lives of children to earn their forgiveness for their sins. And as they do, the land returns to its green and fruitful form, restoring the toys to their former state. In the epilogue of <a data-ref-id=\"4045-51198\" href=\"/cubs-in-toyland/4045-51198/\">Cubs in Toyland</a>, its revealed that Mountbatten was narrating the end of the story. In it, he reveals that he's the only toy she couldn't restore. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14662\" href=\"/therese/4005-14662/\">Therese</a> deeply regrets being unable to bring him back.</p><p>He believes its because he was not part of her kingdom. It could be possible as he was part of the India Homelands; or because his body was left in the mundy world when he traveled to Toyland; or simply because he had not been broken like the toys. Or perhaps he's a reminder to Therese for her sins. Whatever the rules, all that was shown is that he is mostly made of metal and scrapped parts, with grown tree roots and flower vines that keep his empty body propped up. He did regret never being able to tell Bigby or <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7265\" href=\"/snow/4005-7265/\">Snow</a> what became of their children. But in a way, a now grown Therese does a favor for him. She returns to the mundy world and does it for him, telling her family what became of Darien and how he saved her.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2> <p> <br />Lash LaRue was a roving U. S. Marshal who with his horse Black Diamond (some times called Rush) patrolled the American West righting wrongs and giving lectures  about right and wrong and whip safety. </p> <p>Although he carried a gun, he was noted for preferring to use an 18 foot long bull whip which confronting the bad guys, Lash was so proficient with the whip that he could do more than just battle with one of his more common stunts being saving people about to fall to their doom by wrapping the whip around them, often while at full gallop on Black Diamond, and pulling them to safety. Lash was also known for always wearing black. <br /> <br />He was often opposed by his identical twin brother, a villain known as the Frontier Phantom.      <br /></p> <h2>Creators</h2> <p> <br />Alfred \"Lash\" LaRue (June 14, 1921–May 21, 1996) was one of many actors in the 40s and 50s who spent most of his career making B-Westerns, originally hired because he looked enough like Humphrey Bogart that producers thought this would draw in more viewers, along with using his real last name as the name for most of his film characters LaRue also used his real skill with a whip to make his screen character presents more unique. </p> <p>The comic book series that was named after his screen character was one of the most popular Western Comics published, running for 12 years at Fawcett and then Charlton.     </p>",

She unwittingly carried away her royal signet and wore it without knowing its value as she served as a slave girl in a faraway land.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Drawn by <a href=\"/howard-larsen/4040-44616/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44616\">Howard Larsen</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Back to Ormuz</h3><p>In the distant land of Tarko, Malu serves as a slave girl to the king. She is surprised one day to see a prisoner, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/garth/4005-92263/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92263\">Garth</a>, being mistreated by the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/king-of-tarko/4005-92207/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92207\">King of Tarko</a>. She sneaks into his cell later that night and learns that she is the maiden he has been looking for, as she is the true heir to the throne in Ormuz. Malu is caught in Garth's cell and the two are sentenced to death at the hands of lions. In the pit, Malu prays that the information she has learned from others that there is a secret passage out of the colosseum. There is. She and Garth escape Tarko while the lions rip up the citizens.</p><p>The two flee through a mountain pass and find a city before dark. The king of the city, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/thuz/4005-92203/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92203\">Thuz</a>, welcomes the two and give them a room. Malu and Garth learn that the king wishes to take Malu at any cost and the two try to escape the city. Their flight is foiled and they attend a banquet instead. Wine is brought but the server tells Malu that Garth's goblet is poisoned. Malu picks up Garth's goblet and feigns taking a drink. The king dispenses with pretense and orders Garth's death. A fight breaks out and Thuz attempts to flee with Malu as his captive. She is saved by Garth and the city is given back to the rule of the rightful <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/boy-king/4005-92212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92212\">boy king</a>. The boy king offers to transport the two to Ormuz in one of his caravans.</p><p>While traveling, Malu tries to get Garth to admit his love for her. He can't, as he feels unworthy. She storms off and gets abducted by thieves on the border of the camp. She is bound and held captive until Garth is able to find her. She is once again seized upon as Garth battles every thief in the hideout. He is finally able to free her and the two travel to Ormuz on horseback.</p><p>At Ormuz, Malu and Garth are captured by men who sell Malu back into slavery. Fortunately, Garth comes to her rescue again and buys her at the market. She accepts her role as his literal slave girl and binds herself to him. They get back to Ormuz and try to approach the king. It turns out, however, that Malu's uncle <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/phao/4005-92198/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92198\">Phao</a> has orchestrated all the events that have plagued Malu's life (even the abduction by thieves) so as to take her place as heir to the throne. He convinces the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/king-of-ormuz/4005-92205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92205\">King of Ormuz</a> to banish the two. He does. Malu is made Phao's slave girl while Garth is made a rower on one of Phao's ship.</p><h3>Banished to Sea</h3><p>On a voyage, Malu learns that a pirate ship approaches. The pirates attack and the ship is besieged. Garth springs free and kills Phao. Malu is then taken captive by a pirate but is freed by Garth. Instead of being slaves to the pirates, Malu and Garth leap into the sea.</p><p>The two wash ashore of a foreign land and are immediately taken captive by Zarkharan guards who think the two are Tirzan spies. The queen of Zarkhara, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shala/4005-92650/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92650\">Shala</a>, makes Malu her slave and Garth her personal attendant. Malu serves faithfully until she sees Shala make a move on Garth. She accuses the queen of debasing herself and Shala imprisons Malu in the Tower of Indecision. Malu is joined by Garth and the two battle monsters until they find a way to escape to the general prison population. One of the prisoners is the brother of the queen and knows the secret ways out. Malu escapes to Tirza and waits while Garth leads an army against Zarkhara. She is overjoyed to hear that Garth is okay at the end of it all and promises to stay with him as rules over the recently taken city. Neither are aware that a sacred boulder has been pushed and is falling on them.</p><p>The reader does not learn the fate of Malu since the series is canceled.</p>",
